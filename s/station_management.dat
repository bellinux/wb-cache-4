Many outrageous acts of destruction were subsequently perpetrated, including one caller who purposely drove his own car into a wall. The caller who totaled his car did not win the contest, and sued the <b>station.</b> KYSR <b>management</b> immediately terminated Trenton upon learning of this contest, which ultimately cost the station over $100,000.|$|R

The deal, which resulted in the end of WISH-TV's 58-year relationship with CBS, was reportedly struck as a result of WISH <b>station</b> <b>management</b> balking at the network's demands for sharing of retransmission consent revenue from its affiliates. This marked the second time in Indianapolis television history that WTTV took an affiliation from WISH, the first being ABC in 1956.|$|E
25|$|This {{dramatic}} shift in format {{would not be}} without consequences. Most significantly, the change sparked a rebellion in its fan base. The station's mid-day phone-in request show was inundated with requests for alternative songs. In support of their new policies and format, <b>station</b> <b>management</b> quickly attempted {{to put a stop}} to this by ordering that DJs were to refuse all such calls and fulfill only those requests which were for Top 40 music. Not just unpopular with the station's fan base, the new format also resulted in the dismissal or resignation of much of the on-air staff. Perhaps the most notable of these was the resignation of program director Don Berns after only two years in the role, in protest against station management's decisions.|$|E

Additionally, meteorologist Carol Erickson resigned after a 37-year career at the station to focus more upon her animal rights advocacy. The next day, on July 1, it was announced that Ukee Washington would be shifted from mornings to weeknights to co-anchor alongside Jessica Dean, while Kate Bilo would take over Orr's slots (and take Orr's position as the station's Chief Meteorologist) and morning meteorologist Katie Fehlinger would be added to the noon newscast replacing Bilo.|$|E

25|$|On August 11, 2014, CBS and Tribune Broadcasting {{announced}} that WTTV would become Indianapolis' CBS affiliate beginning on January 1, 2015. The deal, which {{was part of}} an agreement that also renewed the CBS affiliations on Tribune-owned stations in four other markets, including WTKR, which is owned by Dreamcatcher Broadcasting and operated by Tribune, was driven by CBS' desire for reverse retransmission consent compensation from its affiliates; WISH-TV had been in negotiations to renew its agreement with the network, but <b>station</b> <b>management</b> reportedly balked at CBS' demands. This led to CBS reaching a deal with WTTV, which Tribune was eager to land since the network holds the broadcast television rights to the AFC, which includes rights to most of the Indianapolis Colts' regular season games. This marked the second time that WTTV has taken a network affiliation away from WISH, the first being when it took the ABC affiliation in 1956.|$|E

During his program, Berg called Kaplan on the phone. When she answered, he introduced her as “a vile human being” and praised Nancy Kissinger's attack on her. After Kaplan hung up, Berg continued to ridicule Kaplan and abuse her verbally for the remainder of the program. Afterwards, KOA received complaints by listeners and Kaplan's boyfriend, and on suggestion of the lawyers of the station owners General Electric, the <b>station</b> <b>management</b> suspended Berg from work for a few days. After returning to work, Berg toned down his methods somewhat.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, KGO-TV {{moved to}} one of the most modern {{broadcasting}} facilities on the West Coast at the time at 277 Golden Gate Avenue, formerly known as the Eagle Building. The building was demolished between 2010 and 2011. As an ABC-owned station, KGO-TV originated a few network daytime shows, including programs hosted by fitness expert Jack La Lanne, singer Tennessee Ernie Ford, and entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee. Syndicated game shows Oh My Word and The Anniversary Game were produced at KGO-TV by Circle Seven Productions. In the mid-1950s, KGO-TV telecast live weeknight variety shows hosted by KSFO disc jockey Don Sherwood, until Sherwood was fired for making a political comment in defiance of a warning from <b>station</b> <b>management.</b> In September 1962, KGO began carrying ABC's first color program, the animated series The Jetsons, followed by The Flintstones. In the mid 1960s, KGO became the first Bay Area station to broadcast local programs in color, including its newscasts. In 1985, KGO-TV began broadcasting from its current studios at 900 Front Street, sharing the facility with radio stations KGO (AM 810), KSFO and KMKY (the former two are now owned by Cumulus Media).|$|E
