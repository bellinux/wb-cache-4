5|$|The {{contact angle}} (θ), as <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 1, is the angle {{at which the}} liquid–vapor {{interface}} meets the solid-liquid interface. The contact angle {{is determined by the}} result between adhesive and cohesive forces. As the tendency of a drop to spread out over a flat, solid surface increases, the contact angle decreases. Thus, the contact angle provides an inverse measure of wettability.|$|E
5|$|The rose petal's micro- and {{nanostructures}} {{are larger}} in scale {{than those of}} the lotus leaf, which allows the liquid film to impregnate the texture. However, as <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 9, the liquid can enter the larger-scale grooves, but it cannot enter into the smaller grooves. This is known as the Cassie impregnating wetting regime. Since the liquid can wet the larger-scale grooves, the adhesive force between the water and solid is very high. This explains why the water droplet will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or turned upside down. This effect will fail if the droplet has a volume larger than 10 µl because the balance between weight and surface tension is surpassed.|$|E

Most discussions of gyro angle determination take the simpler approach of using Figure 3, which is called the torpedo fire control triangle. Figure 3 provides an accurate model for computing the gyro angle when the gyro angle is small, usually less than 30°.|$|E

This process is highly complex because the vendor often has to deal with a product which has multiple versions, variable features, dependency on external products, and different kinds of distribution options. The CCU method helps the software vendor in structuring this process.|$|E
25|$|Bicalutamide is an arylpropionamide analog, <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 6. It has {{replaced}} flutamide and nilutamide {{as the first}} choice antiandrogen for prostate cancer treatment. Bicalutamide is not as hepatotoxic as flutamide and nilutamide and has a longer half-life, of 6 days in humans, that allows once a day administration at lower dosage. Bicalutamide shares the amide bond structure with flutamide. Even so, the amide bond hydrolysis was discovered in rats, not in humans, which could explain the prolonged half life of bicalutamide in humans.|$|E
25|$|Nilutamide is a nitroaromatic {{hydantoin}} analog of flutamide, as <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 5. Nilutamide {{is eliminated}} exclusively by metabolism, mainly {{by reduction of}} the aromatic nitro group. Although the hydrolysis {{of one of the}} carbonyl functions of the imidazolinedione was identified, it is much less susceptible to hepatic metabolism than the amide bond in hydroxuflutamide. This results in a longer half-life of nilutamide in humans of 2 days. Nevertheless, the nitro anion-free radical formed during nitro reduction could still be associated with hepatotoxicity in humans, especially when using relatively high dosage employed for androgen blockage. Nilutamide causes side-effects which limit its usage, such as pneumonitis and delayed adaption to darkness.|$|E

25|$|Hydroxyflutamide and its analogues, {{bicalutamide}} and nilutamide, {{share an}} anilide ring structure. The structures can be <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 7, where the anilide ring is coloured red. These three compounds require an electron-deficient aromatic ring for efficient AR binding. Replacing the anilide with an alkene gives weakly active compounds, {{which can be}} attributed to the lack of intramolecular hydrogen binding or to poor hydrogen-bond donor capability. Various combinations of electron-withdrawing substitutions in the aniline ring of these drugs have not shown higher binding to the AR receptor, compared to compounds which have a chloro or trifluoromethyl group at the meta position (R1) and either a cyano or nitrogen group at the para position (R2).|$|E

During the wetting transition from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state, the air pockets are no longer thermodynamically stable and liquid begins to nucleate {{from the middle of the}} drop, creating a “mushroom state” as <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 10.

500|$|A post filter {{consists}} of several rows of posts across {{the width of}} the waveguide which separate the waveguide into resonant cavities as shown in figure 7. [...] Differing numbers of posts can be used in each row to achieve varying values of inductance. [...] An example can be <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 1.

500|$|The {{main line}} is the section between ports 1 and 2 and the coupled {{line is the}} section between ports 3 and 4. [...] Since the {{directional}} coupler is a linear device, the notations on figure 1 are arbitrary. [...] Any port can be the input, (an example is <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 20) which {{will result in the}} directly connected port being the transmitted port, the adjacent port being the coupled port, and the diagonal port being the isolated port. [...] On some directional couplers, the main line is designed for high power operation (large connectors), while the coupled port may use a small connector, such as an SMA connector. [...] The internal load power rating may also limit operation on the coupled line.|$|E

500|$|When {{comparing}} the [...] "petal effect" [...] to the [...] "lotus effect", {{it is important}} to note some striking differences. The surface structure of the lotus leaf and the rose petal, as <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 9, can be used to explain the two different effects. The lotus petal has a randomly rough surface and low contact angle hysteresis, which means the water droplet is not able to wet the microstructure spaces between the spikes. This allows air to remain inside the texture, causing a heterogeneous surface composed of both air and solid. As a result, the adhesive force between the water and the solid surface is extremely low, allowing the water to roll off easily (i.e. [...] "self-cleaning" [...] phenomenon).|$|E
500|$|The hairpin filter {{is another}} {{structure}} that uses parallel-coupled lines. In this case, {{each pair of}} parallel-coupled lines {{is connected to the}} next pair by a short link. The [...] "U" [...] shapes so formed give rise to the name hairpin filter. In some designs the link can be longer, giving a wide hairpin with λ/4 impedance transformer action between sections. The angled bends <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 10 are common to stripline designs and represent a compromise between a sharp right angle, which produces a large discontinuity, and a smooth bend, which takes up more board area which can be severely limited in some products. Such bends are often seen in long stubs where they could not otherwise be fitted into the space available. The lumped-element equivalent circuit of this kind of discontinuity is similar to a stepped-impedance discontinuity. Examples of such stubs can be seen on the bias inputs to several components in the photograph {{at the top of the}} article.|$|E

Table 1 and Figure 7 show that performance is good across the board with LAIRX being superior. It is interesting {{to point out that}} the nonlinear technique is performing poorly in contrast to the other algorithms. Additionally, the data associated with these images is separable in a lower dimensional subspace, as you can <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 3, which indicates that the RX type approach should perform well. Also, note that for ARES 2 F and ARES 3 F the SVDD statistic maps depicted <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 5 is showing that large natural anomalies have a similar value as the targets, which leads to a higher false positive rate.|$|R
