5|$|It is {{possible}} that a panmictic (random mating) wolf population, with gene flow spanning Eurasia and North America, existed until {{the closing of the}} ice <b>sheets,</b> after which the southern wolves became isolated, and only the Beringian wolf existed north of the <b>sheets.</b> The land bridge became inundated by the sea 10,000YBP, and the ice <b>sheets</b> receded 12,000—6,000YBP. The Beringian wolf became extinct, and the southern wolves expanded through the shrinking ice <b>sheets</b> to recolonize the northern part of North America. All North American wolves are descended from those that were once isolated south of the ice <b>sheets.</b> However, much of their diversity was later lost during the twentieth century due to eradication.|$|E

5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, <b>sheets</b> of impregnated material are cut into square <b>sheets</b> and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 <b>sheets</b> may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the <b>sheets</b> into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E
