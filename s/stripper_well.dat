40|$|<b>Stripper</b> gas <b>wells</b> are an {{important}} source of domestic energy supply and under constant threat of permanent loss (shut-in) due to marginal economics. In 1998, 192 thousand <b>stripper</b> gas <b>wells</b> produced over a Tcf of gas, at an average rate of less than 16 Mcfd. This represents about 57 % of all producing gas wells in the onshore lower- 48 states, yet only 8 % of production. Reserves of <b>stripper</b> gas <b>wells</b> are estimated to be only 1. 6 Tcf, or slightly over 1 % of the onshore lower- 48 total (end of year 1996 data). Obviously, <b>stripper</b> gas <b>wells</b> are at the very margin of economic sustenance. As the demand for natural gas in the U. S. grows to the forecasted estimate of over 30 Tcf annually by the year 2010, supply from current conventional sources is expected to decline. Therefore, {{an important}} need exists to fully exploit known domestic resources of natural gas, including those represented by <b>stripper</b> gas <b>wells.</b> The overall objectives of this project are to develop an efficient and low-cost methodology to broadly categorize the well performance characteristics for a stripper gas field, identify the high-potential candidate wells for remediation, and diagnose the specific causes for well underperformance. With this capability, <b>stripper</b> gas <b>well</b> operators can more efficiently and economically produce these resources and maximize these gas reserves. A further objective is to identify/develop, evaluate and test ''new and novel,'' economically viable remediation options. Finally, it is the objective of this project that all the methods and technologies developed in this project, while being tested in the Mid-Continent, be widely applicable to <b>stripper</b> gas <b>wells</b> of all types across the country.
