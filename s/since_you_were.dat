500|$|Although he {{occasionally}} downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself {{was aware that}} his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts {{to be recognized as}} an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny).

Oprah Winfrey commented: [...] "What you're seeing in all the areas of arts and entertainment is black women internalizing the idea of black power and pride...
