50|$|In principle, spiral ropes are round strands as {{they have}} an {{assembly}} of layers of wires laid helically over a centre {{with at least one}} layer of wires being laid in the opposite direction to that of the outer layer. Spiral ropes can be dimensioned {{in such a way that}} they are non-rotating which means that under tension the rope torque is nearly zero.The open <b>spiral</b> <b>rope</b> consists only of round wires. The half-locked coil rope and the full-locked coil rope always have a centre made of round wires. The locked coil ropes have one or more outer layers of profile wires. They have the advantage that their construction prevents the penetration of dirt and water to a greater extent and it also protects them from loss of lubricant. In addition, they have one further very important advantage as the ends of a broken outer wire cannot leave the rope if it has the proper dimensions.|$|E

The models were imported into the ANSYS/Workbench. Behavior {{of the models}} obtained from finite element analysis was compared with theoretical and experimental data. The effect of twisting manner on open <b>spiral</b> <b>rope</b> was analyzed.|$|E
30|$|The {{structures}} of model 2 {{are different from}} model 1 in twisting manner of outer and the strain and stresses of model 2 are higher than model 1. The {{structures of}} model 3 are different from model 1 in twisting manner of first layer and these two models are similar in strain and stresses. Contrasting the structures of three models, {{it means that the}} second twisting manner of open <b>spiral</b> <b>rope</b> 1  ×  37 should be contrary to that of the outer layer. In processing of manufacture the twisting manner similar to twisting manner of model 2 do not choose.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Since the {{introduction}} of flexible snow nets in the 1950 ’s {{it became obvious that}} such barriers provide a better performance on combined loadings of static snow pressure and dynamic rockfall impacts compared to stiff steel bridges. In various cases avalanche barriers in the starting zone have to be built under rock faces with frequent rockfall. On a qualitative basis it was found that rigid systems e. g. snow bridges made of steel are not able to withstand rock fall energies of more than 50 kJ. This {{is the result of a}} research project and case studies in Switzerland, Austria and Germany together with the alpS – Zentrum für Naturgefahrenmanagement and WSL- Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF (Margreth 2006 a and b). The investigations have shown that flexible snow nets have a higher energy absorption capacity which may be even more than 200 kJ. To obtain a bet-ter understanding of the interaction and performance of rock fall on snow nets and to quantify the ca-pacity of snow nets a trial of 4 different 1 : 1 large scale rockfall tests with flexible snow nets have been done. With this testing it is possible to quantify the rockfall capacity of a new type of snow net. Integral part of this snow net is a rhomboidal <b>spiral</b> <b>rope</b> net with a load capacity of 220 kN/m’. The rockfall bearing capacity could be even increased by applying stronger <b>spiral</b> <b>rope</b> nets. As a result it was pos-sible to achieve a rock fall capacity of up to 500 kJ which is ten times more compared to rigid struc-tures. This rockfall adapted snow net system has been already installed in Austria. In this paper the project is presented and detailed information about the performed test series is provided. The results of our technical development are improved flexible avalanche supporting structures which can with-stand rockfall energies up to 500 kJ leading to reduced costs for maintenance and repair respectively...|$|E
30|$|Accurate {{understanding}} {{the behavior of}} <b>spiral</b> <b>rope</b> is complicated due to their complex geometry and complex contact conditions between the wires. This study proposed the finite element models of spiral ropes subjected to tensile loads. The parametric equations developed in this paper were implemented for geometric modeling of ropes. The 3 D geometric models with different twisting manner, equal diameters of wires were generated in details by using Pro/ENGINEER software. The {{results of the present}} finite element analysis were on an acceptable level of accuracy as compared with those of theoretical and experimental data. Further development is ongoing to analysis the equivalent stresses induced by twisting manner of cables. The twisting manner of wires was important to spiral ropes in the three wire layers and the outer twisting manner of wires should be contrary to that of the second layer, no matter what is the first twisting manner of wires.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{remarkable}} development in offshore wind energy. From the view of cost efficiency, floating wind turbine becomes more competitive than bottom fixed wind turbine when the water depth comes above 50 m. Semi-submersible floater concepts have been proposed to be deployed in shallow waters (50 m - 100 m) because of its smaller draft compared to other floater types. However, mooring system design is extremely challenging for floating structures in shallow water. There is a transition from linearity to nonlinearity {{in the relationship between}} mooring line tension and offset at the fairlead, which indicates a potential for extremely large mooring line tension during harsh environment when the floater motions have large offset ranges. Moreover, the nonlinear tension increment in shallow water becomes more critical than deep water. In addition, the degree of tightness of mooring system will influence the tension increment trend as well. In present thesis, two mooring system design concepts in 100 m and 50 m water depth (shallow water) have been proposed for the use of 5 -MW-CSC semi-submersible floating wind turbine. Original mooring system design in 200 m water depth is taken as a reference. Initially, preliminary static design has been carried out in SIMA to determine mooring line properties, mooring system configurations and document static performances of mooring line. Afterwards, free decay tests are carried out to calculate the natural periods of the floating wind turbine with mooring system at six degrees of freedom in the three water depths. At last, fully coupled time-domain dynamic analysis in ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state were performed using Simo-Riflex-AeroDyn. Critical responses have been checked to verify if proposed design concepts satisfy design standards. In order to achieve desired mooring line pretension and catenary shape in different water depths, studless chain link has been chosen for 50 m and <b>spiral</b> <b>rope</b> has been selected for 100 m. The corresponding clump weights have been enlarged to 60 tonnes for both cases. Moreover, in order to avoid large nonlinear tension increment, mooring system is designed to be soft on purpose in 50 m. Meanwhile, corresponding natural periods have been examined to be close to the reference model, larger than the periods of most relevant waves. Extreme condition test results indicate that the maximum response of mooring line tension and floater motion occurs when wave is acting aligned with mooring line configuration. Despite, mooring line strengths are sufficient in the light of utilization factor calculations and floater motions have been successfully limited to a reasonable extent. In accordance with operational condition test, accumulated fatigue damage for chain link is larger than <b>spiral</b> <b>rope,</b> even though the stress ranges do not show big difference. This is because highly contact force between chain links produces significant fatigue damage, which does not apply to <b>spiral</b> <b>rope.</b> Furthermore, there is no protection treatment for chain link like plastic sheathing for wire rope. According to spectrum analysis, wave is dominating the responses during extreme condition, while wind contributes most to the responses by influencing low-frequency motion resonant responses in operational condition. The strategy to fight against the nonlinear tension increment in 50 m is to design the mooring system to be relatively soft, which will lead to relatively large floater motion at the same time. Nevertheless, the compromise has achieved great effect: extreme mooring line tensions do not exceed the capacities, even though the tension has increased nonlinearly. Meanwhile the compromised floater motions are under reasonable ranges, without mooring line being totally lifted up. Mooring system design for 100 m shows great performance as well without extreme line tension or large floater motion, which could be regarded as a satisfactory design concept...|$|E

30|$|At {{the present}} time, <b>spiral</b> <b>ropes</b> {{are widely used}} in {{lightweight}} cable-supported structural systems such as sports stadia, suspended bridges and large Ferris wheels. A rope can be a critical load carrier of these structures (Beltrán and Williamson 2011; Stanova et al. 2011 a).|$|R
30|$|The {{finite element}} models of <b>spiral</b> <b>ropes</b> with {{complicated}} geometry and contact conditions had been developed in this study. The normal stresses and force-strain relationship of the studied ropes obtained by the present finite element analysis were compared with those obtained theoretically and experimentally. The present FE model was proved to be accurate sufficiently as compared with theoretical and experimental result, which can be utilized to optimize key geometric parameter-twisting manner.|$|R
3000|$|Further {{development}} is ongoing {{to analyze the}} equivalent stresses which was induced by the twisting manner of cables. The twisting manner in each layer was important to ropes and the twisting manner of open <b>spiral</b> <b>ropes</b> with three layers should not choose the twisting manner of model 2. The outer twisting manner should be contrary {{to that of the}} second layer, no matter what is the first twisting manner of wires.|$|R
30|$|The {{equivalent}} {{stress of the}} first layer in model 2 {{is larger than the}} yield stress 1, 580  MPa (Beltrán and Williamson 2011) from F 2  =  20, 000  N to F 4  =  30, 000  N. Plastic deformation happens on the wires of first layer. Though the twisting manner of model 2 are satisfied with that <b>spiral</b> <b>ropes</b> were round strands as they had an assembly of layers of wires laid helically over a center with at least one layer of wires being laid in the opposite direction to that of the outer layer (Feyrer 2007), {{it can be seen that}} the {{equivalent stress}}es of layers in model 2 are higher than that of model 1 which further confirms the second and third twisting manner have effect on ropes.|$|R
40|$|<b>Spiral</b> wire <b>rope</b> strands and {{overhead}} electrical conductors {{are examples of}} helical wire assemblies. The use of these helically wound wires constitute a wide class of important engineering components. When they are subjected to axial loads (tensile and torsional), these structures may still exhibit the helically symmetric characteristic after loading. For this reason, this feature {{can be used to}} simplify the analysis of these structures and to reduce model size in numerical simulations. In this paper, the formulation of helically symmetric boundary conditions is used and a general strand model using the finite element method (FEM) is presented. The model is capable of taking into account the effects of tension, shear, torsion, contact, friction and possible local plastic yielding and has been successfully used to predict the global behavior of simple straight wire rope strand as well as the stress distribution, which are very difficult to predict analytically. As most of the strand models, the length of the strand is assumed sufficiently long for the clamping conditions to be negligible. The finite analysis results showed excellent agreement with the analytical theory of Costello and the experimental results obtained by Utting and Jones [6, 7]...|$|R
40|$|Mooring {{lines that}} are used on {{floating}} offshore units are subjected to bending at the end termination. Over-bending in some cases may cause the mooring line to suffer damage from fatigue. A countermeasure for this over-bending has been to implement bend stiffeners at the end terminations. National Oilwell Varco procures wire ropes and two bend stiffeners from 3 rd party suppliers. The scope of this thesis is to study {{the effect of these}} bend stiffeners and their impact on the fatigue life of the wire rope mooring lines. Models of <b>spiral</b> wire <b>rope,</b> bend stiffeners and wire sheathing were created in CAD software Inventor™. Finite element analysis was performed using FAE software ANSYS™. The analysis was conducted using two different loads at three different load angles for both types of existing bend stiffeners. The results indicate that the implementation of a bend stiffener has a positive effect on the fatigue life of the wire ropes investigated. However, there is an insignificant difference between the two types of bend stiffeners currently in production. A third type of bend stiffener was designed and FEA analysis was conducted in the same fashion as for the existing bend stiffeners. The results show a great increase in the service life of the wire ropes in all the load cases investigated when implementing this new design...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was an even}} {{bet that}} Clarence had {{procured}} that favor for me --and furnished the language, too. When that formidable lance-point was within a yard {{and a half of}} my breast I twitched my horse aside without an effort, and the big knight swept by, scoring a blank. I got plenty of applause that time. We turned, braced up, and down we came again. Another blank for the knight, a roar of applause for me. This same thing was repeated once more; and it fetched such a whirlwind of applause that Sir Sagramor lost his temper, and at once changed his tactics and set himself the task of chasing me down. Why, he hadn't any show in the world at that; it was a game of tag, with all the advantage on my side; I whirled out of his path with ease whenever I chose, and once I slapped him on the back as I went to the rear. Finally I took the chase into my own hands; and after that, turn, or twist, or do what he would, he was never able to get behind me again; he found himself always in front {{at the end of his}} maneuver. So he gave up that business and retired to his end of the lists. His temper was clear gone now, and he forgot himself and flung an insult at me which disposed of mine. I slipped my lasso from the horn of my saddle, and grasped the coil in my right hand. This time you should have seen him come!--it was a business trip, sure; by his gait there was blood in his eye. I was sitting my horse at ease, and swinging the great loop of my lasso in wide circles about my head; the moment he was under way, I started for him; when the space between us had narrowed to forty feet, I sent the snaky <b>spirals</b> of the <b>rope</b> a-cleaving through the air, then darted aside and faced about and brought my trained animal to a halt with all his feet braced under him for a surge. The next moment the rope sprang taut and yanked Sir Sagramor out of the saddle! Great Scott, but there was a sensation! ...|$|R
