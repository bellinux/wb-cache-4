40|$|Softness is {{a unique}} selling point for luxury fibres such as alpaca. However, {{there is very little}} {{objective}} data on the <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> animal <b>fibres.</b> This study first establishes that the resistance to compression (RtC) behaviour of alpaca and wool fibres is quite different, and that the RtC method {{can not be used to}} examine the <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> different animal <b>fibres.</b> It then reports a new method for evaluating fibre softness. This method is based on the measurement of the force required to pull a fibre bundle through a series of parallel pins. This force, reflecting the combined effect <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> surface properties, fibre diameter and rigidity, can achieve reasonable discrimination between <b>fibres</b> <b>of</b> varying levels <b>of</b> <b>softness,</b> such as alpaca and wool. Mechanisms responsible for the superior <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> alpaca <b>fibres</b> are discussed also. <br /...|$|R

He had induced some good-humoured native {{to give him a}} passage on a cutter that happened to be sailing from Apia to Safoto, and he had been put ashore here in a dugout. I do not know why he deserted. Perhaps life on a man-of-war with its restrictions irked him, perhaps he was in trouble, and perhaps it was the South Seas and these romantic islands that got into his bones. Every now and then they take a man strangely, and he finds himself like a fly in a spider's web. It may be that there was a <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> in him, and these green hills with their soft airs, this blue sea, took the northern strength from him as Delilah took the Nazarite's. Anyhow, he wanted to hide himself, and he thought he would be safe in this secluded nook till his ship had sailed from Samoa." ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of coarse wool and mohair is their harshness, making them unacceptable to the consumer. The {{best way to}} improve the <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> coarse <b>fibres</b> is by a chemical treatment. In this regard, a variety of options are available and the current study focused {{on the effect of}} enzymes, either alone or in combination with an oxidative (chlorine) treatment, on the softness and other properties <b>of</b> the <b>fibres.</b> It was found that an enzyme treatment reduced the feltability of wool. Furthermore, the scale height <b>of</b> the <b>fibres</b> was reduced by an enzyme treatment and this together with a decrease in the hardness <b>of</b> the <b>fibres,</b> improved the handle of the enzyme treated wool and mohair. The enzyme treatment also resulted in whiter fibres and did not cause any real damage to the wool and mohair. Better results were obtained, in general, if the enzyme treatment was applied to wool that was chlorinated first. The wool and mohair industries are facing many challenges, amongst other, competition from other fibres, diminishing consumption, environmental pressures, etc. Innovative methods and processes should continuously be developed to produce products which will improve the competitiveness of the industry especially as far as the usage of the coarser component of the respective clips i...|$|R

40|$|<b>Softness</b> <b>of</b> apparel {{textiles}} {{is a major}} attribute {{sought by}} consumers. There is surprisingly little objective information on the <b>softness</b> properties <b>of</b> rare animal <b>fibres,</b> particularly cashmere, alpaca and mohair. Samples {{of these and other}} rare animal fibres from different origins of production and processors were objectively measured for fibre diameter, fibre curvature (FC, crimp) and resistance to compression (softness). While there were curvilinear responses of resistance to compression to FC and to mean fibre diameter, FC accounted for much more of the variance in resistance to compression. Fibre type was an important determinant of resistance to compression. The softest fibres were alpaca, mohair and cashgora and all <b>of</b> the <b>fibres</b> measured were softer than most Merino wool. Quivet, llama, camel, guanaco, vicuña, yak wool, bison wool, dehaired cow down and Angora rabbit were also differentiated from alpaca, mohair and cashmere. There were important differences in the <b>softness</b> and FC <b>of</b> cashmere from different origins with cashmere from newer origins of production (Australia, New Zealand and USA) having lower resistance to compression than cashmere from traditional sources of China and Iran. Cashmere from different origins was differentiated on the basis of resistance to compression, FC and fibre diameter. Cashgora was differentiated from cashmere by having a lower FC and lower resistance to compression. There were minority effects <b>of</b> colour and <b>fibre</b> diameter variation on resistance to compression of cashmere. The implications of these findings for the identification and use of softer raw materials are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{unit cell}} of {{geometry}} model {{is applied to}} acquire the material matrix of the woven fabric in the study. The <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> woven fabric {{is related to the}} flexure modulus, which can be obtained from the acquired material matrix. Two sample fabrics are employed to verify the relationship between the softness and the flexure modulus. It reveals that the results are quite promising as expected. An intelligent support system for determining the <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> the fabric based on flexure modulus can thus be implemented in the future. Through the assistance of the system, the softness for different fabrics can be evaluated without any sample fabrics manufacturing in advance. A designer can determine the <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> a piece of fabric without proceeding with the traditionally essential procedure of sample manufacturing. The goal to increase the design efficiency of innovative woven fabric can thus be achieved...|$|R
