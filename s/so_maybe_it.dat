Harkins stated that he ordered Wilson to report to Lodge. Harkins then reported that he was undertaking [...] "a field trip", believed to {{be an attempt to}} lobby Saigon-based forces to join the coup. Harkins was later reported to have said in response to Khánh's asking whether he objected to a coup, [...] "No, I think you are a very fine general." [...] Afterwards, when asked why he had not tipped off the junta, Harkins said that the ruling officers [...] "weren't getting along anyway, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> was a change for the better. I thought it was." ...|$|E
500|$|Jordan Farley from SFX {{magazine}} {{named the}} episode the eighth of the [...] "Top Groundhog Days" [...] episodes. Farley applauded the show's gall to seemingly kill {{one of the}} leads in the teaser and appreciated the entry's mix of humor—during the scenes with Mulder and his water bed—and its alternative scenarios in the bank. Natalie Prado from Just Press Play gave the episode an A– and wrote, [...] "The episode is well-written and tense. As an audience, we become increasingly frustrated that the two people that we know can solve the problem are unaware that it exists, which makes the payoff when they finally {{find a way out}} much more satisfying. There are a few leaps in logic, especially towards the end, but overall it’s solid and enjoyable." [...] Jamie Jeffords, writing for the Dallas Morning News, awarded the episode four out of five stars and praised Hamilton's performance, saying, [...] "What makes 'Monday’ is the performance of Hamilton [...] When she is killed in the end, she almost possesses a quiet glee when she realizes her death never happened before, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> is over now. Her performance is haunting. Very powerful." [...] Michigan Daily writer Melissa Runstrom, in a review of the sixth season, said [...] "Monday" [...] was [...] "well made and entertaining." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris called the episode [...] "ingenious and heart-wrenching," [...] and noted that David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson's acting was the best of the season. Furthermore, she praised Kim Manners' directing style, calling the same scenes shot in different ways [...] "new". UGO Networks listed the episode as number 95 in a countdown of the [...] "100 Greatest Moments in Time Travel".|$|E

5000|$|In an October 2005 {{interview}} with Diva magazine, Powell commented about lesbians in football: [...] "There's {{always been that}} stereotyping of female footballers as butch, dykey and unattractive, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it's</b> just best left alone." ...|$|R

I guess there's a running interest in male vulnerability in my work, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it's</b> just that.|$|R
2500|$|Additionally, {{the turmoil}} that Sue {{had been through}} had led Ratcliff to {{consider}} quitting the serial prematurely. In 1987 she told the magazine Woman's Own, [...] "'s been such an unhappy woman since Hassan died. And {{it was beginning to}} rub off on me. I'd go to work, six days a week, be stuck in that grim little cafe and be permanently miserable. I got to the stage when I started to ask myself if I really wanted to spend all my working life playing a misery." [...] However, according to Ratcliff, the scriptwriters decision to make Sue pregnant changed her mind about leaving. She said, [...] "Now Sue is pregnant and happy I feel differently about the role. <b>So</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> would be fun to stick around for a couple more years - if I'm wanted." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sam Wollaston from The Guardian {{referred}} to it as [...] "an excuse to show some raelly nasty people and their behaviour on the television". Though he does feel the documentary improves towards the end: [...] "When a contributor who has featured throughout, Sam Vaknin, revaels that he is a sufferer. And then we get to see him in action, the out-takes of the making of the film[...] [...] swaggers around Camden Market in London, shouting at people, demanding money, as if he owns the place.

6000|$|The hero {{climbs up}} over [...] "Sawney's Mountain," [...] {{and down the}} other side, making for an old Indian [...] "castle"--which becomes [...] "the red man's hut" [...] in the next sentence; and when he gets there at last, he [...] "surveys with wonder and astonishment" [...] the {{invisible}} structure, [...] "which time has buried in the dust, and thought to himself his happiness was not yet complete." [...] One doesn't know why it wasn't, nor how near it came to being complete, nor what was still wanting to round it up and make it <b>so.</b> <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> was the Indian; but the book does not say.

'Well, I own, before ever I saw him, {{when they}} said he would die, I did think it was best for himself, and every one else. <b>So,</b> <b>maybe,</b> <b>it</b> would; but you see I shouldn't like it. He will be a horrible expense, {{and it will be}} a great bore to know what to do with him: so absurd to have a son only twenty years younger than oneself: but I think I like him, after all. It is {{something}} to work for, to make up to him for what she suffered. And I say, Lucy,' his eye brightened, 'perhaps Honor will take to him! What a thing it would be if he turned out all she hoped of me, poor thing! I would be banished for life, if he could be in my place, and make it up to her. He might yet have the Holt!' ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Maybe you shouldn't {{have been}} able to {{interpret}} it that much, because it was about wonder. The theme of the show was to take things that we're very familiar with, and make them seem again wonderful to us: the things that you know about the industrial revolution and the internet, and say 'Aren't these things astonishing, that we live in the middle of?' and to kind of re-polish the pattern of life. <b>So</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it's</b> alright that you were a little bit bewildered."

With these he lay in those waters of Jamaica for over a month after his return from the coasts of Africa, waiting for news from home, which, when it came, was of the very blackest; for the colonial authorities were at that time stirred up very hot against him to take him and hang him for a pirate, so as to clear their own skirts for having to do with such a fellow. <b>So</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> seemed better to our captain to hide his ill-gotten treasure there in those far-away parts, and afterward to try and bargain with it for his life when he should reach New York, rather than to sail straight for the Americas with what he had earned by his piracies, and so risk losing life and money both.|$|E

5000|$|Rod Liddle, {{writing in}} The Sunday Times, praised the show, {{although}} he was somewhat surprised, saying, [...] "An exquisitely middle-class, middle-aged domestic situation comedy set in West London - and starring one of those bloody stand-up comics who now festoons every network, it really should be hated before it is even seen. Start liking this sort of programme and you are an ace away from enjoying Terry and June and having a house that smells faintly of weak tea, Murray Mints and urine. <b>So,</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it's</b> just me, but Outnumbered is very funny indeed: despite its current bout of self-flagellation, the BBC still {{knows how to make}} people laugh.

5000|$|When {{asked about}} the {{significance}} of Coal Hill School, Anderson said, I think it's something everybody likes a bit of nostalgia and I think it's a bit of a high-five to the past—two of the original companions taught at Coal Hill School.

The guy can be anywhere in time and space whenever and I suppose it helps, it's a useful tool to say this is where we are, we're back in London and this school is here; we're back in this specific area of London.

Tonight's episode starts to {{follow-up}} on that dangling thread before literally taking a detour through shit, and then Selina disappears {{for the rest of}} the story. That's not necessarily a bad thing because Camren Bicondova isn't the strongest actor, but it's frustrating from a plot perspective. Gordon takes Selina back to Crime Alley, then immediately starts wondering why he should believe her instead of getting information he could use to track down the Waynes' killer. I'm no expert on police procedure, <b>so</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it's</b> regular practice to make sure a witness was actually at the scene before getting information, but it all feels like a way to delay the resolution of last week's cliffhanger for a few more weeks. The Wayne murder investigation is the driving force of this show's narrative, but the baby steps taken in this episode make that essential aspect of the story feel like an afterthought." ...|$|R
