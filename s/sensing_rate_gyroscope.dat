40|$|Harsh {{environment}} applications include high temperature, {{pressure and}} mechanical shock. Aluminum nitride {{is a strong}} ceramic material with very good high temperature survivability. It also has piezoelectric properties {{that can be used}} for sensing applications and it can be deposited with good control as thin polycrystalline film for the fabrication of micro-electromechanical systems. In this dissertation, optimized deposition parameters for aluminum nitride films and characterization techniques for film stress gradients are investigated. Furthermore, two different fabrication processes are presented that can be used to build several sensors and other micromechanical elements on a single chip. The more advanced process includes a bulk-micromachining step that enables the use of the silicon substrate as large proof masses for accelerometers. At the same time, the fabrication process can be used to create membranes for devices such as pressure sensors. Several different devices are discussed from the device design and theoretical analysis to the fabrication and experimental verification. The most significant contribution is the performance improvement of several orders of magnitude that can be achieved with aluminum nitride accelerometers by switching from double-ended tuning forks to triple-beam tuning forks and by using the newly discovered sensing concept of bent-beam <b>sensing.</b> Additionally, <b>rate</b> <b>gyroscopes</b> were presented that use aluminum nitride as the structural material and for both actuating the drive axis and reading the sense axis. Both types of sensors have potential applications in inertial navigation at high temperature. Double-ended tuning forks and triple-beam tuning forks were tested in hot environment and it was shown that they can be used as highly sensitive strain sensors up to at least 570 ~degC. Additionally, a testing setup for high temperature testing of accelerometers was demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{an alternative}} sensor fusion approach for object orientation using low-cost MEMS inertial sensors. The alternative approach {{focuses on the}} unique challenges of small UAVs. Such challenges include the vibrational induced noise onto the accelerometer and bias offset errors of the <b>rate</b> <b>gyroscope.</b> To overcome these challenges, a sensor fusion algorithm combines the measured data from the accelerometer and <b>rate</b> <b>gyroscope</b> to achieve a single output free from vibrational noise and bias offset errors. One of the most prevalent sensor fusion algorithms used for orientation estimation is the Extended Kalman filter (EKF). The EKF filter performs the fusion process by first creating the process model using the nonlinear equations of motion and then establishing a measurement model. With the process and measurement models established, the filter operates by propagating the mean and covariance of the states through time. The success of EKF relies {{on the ability to}} establish a representative process and measurement model of the system. In most applications, the EKF measurement model utilizes the accelerometer and GPS-derived accelerations to determine an estimate of the orientation. However, if the GPS-derived accelerations are not available then the measurement model becomes less reliable when subjected to harsh vibrational environments. This situation led to the alternative approach, which focuses on the correlation between the <b>rate</b> <b>gyroscope</b> and accelerometer-derived angle. The correlation between the two sensors then determines how much the algorithm will use one sensor over the other. The result is a measurement that does not suffer from the vibrational noise or from bias offset errors...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedSpacecraft attitude estimation and pointing accuracy {{have always been}} limited by imperfect sensors. The <b>rate</b> <b>gyroscope</b> {{is one of the}} most critical instruments used in spacecraft attitude estimation and unfortunately historical trends show this instrument degrades significantly with time. Degraded <b>rate</b> <b>gyroscopes</b> have impacted the missions for several NASA and ESA spacecraft, including the Hubble Telescope. A possible solution to this problem is using a mathematically modeled dynamic gyroscope in lieu of a real one. In this thesis, data from such a gyro is presented and integrated into a spacecraft attitude estimation algorithm. The impediment to spacecraft attitude estimation presented by imperfect sensors has been overcome by developing more accurate sensors and using Kalman filters to reduce the effect of noisy measurements. Kalman filters for spacecraft attitude estimation have historically been based on an Euler angle or quaternion formulation. Though Euler angles and quaternions are arguably the easiest methods with which to describe the attitude of a spacecraft, other methods of describing attitudes do exist - including the Gibbs and Rodriguez parameters. A Kalman filter based upon the Gibbs parameter is presented and analyzed in this thesis. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The authors present {{modeling}} {{approaches to}} describe the coupling of modes in a resonant vibratory <b>rate</b> <b>gyroscope.</b> Modal coupling due to off-diagonal stiffness and damping terms is considered. Three analytical modeling approaches are presented {{in the context of}} a z-axis micromechanical vibratory <b>rate</b> <b>gyroscope</b> fabricated in an integrated polysilicon surface micromachining process. The first approach is based on frequency-response analysis of the gyroscope output. The second approach takes the route of state-space-based system identification to identify the modal-coupling parameters. A third approach based on measured vibration data identifies the coupling parameters due to stiffness and damping. These three methods are then applied to predict the extent of displacement and force coupling between the drive and the sense axes of an existing device as a function of varying degrees of matching between the resonant frequencies associated with the drive and the sense modes. Experimental data show that as the resonant frequencies of the drive and sense modes are brought closer together, an improvement in overall resolution and scale factor of the device is obtained at the expense of an enhanced coupling of forces to displacements between the two axes and the onset of instability for an open-loop sensing implementation...|$|R
