40|$|Includes bibliographyAbstract This report {{contains}} a recap of the presentations {{given by the}} speakers at the 'first Europe-Latin America Dialogue on Promotion of Energy Efficiency', held in Brussels from 28 to 30 October 1998. The event was organized {{within the framework of}} the 'promotion of Energy Efficiency in Latin America' Project, which is cofinanced by ECLAC, through its Natural Resources and Infrastructure Division, and the <b>SYNERGY</b> <b>Programme</b> of the European Commission's XVII Directorate-General of Energy. The project is under the direction of Fernando Sánchez Albavera, ECLAC Regional Adviser on Mining and Energy, and François Casana, head of the European Commission's <b>SYNERGY</b> <b>Programme.</b> The dialogue was sponsored by the European Parliament's Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy and the European Union's Economic and Social Committee, as well as the European Energy Foundation. It falls within the overall context of the activities carried out under the ECLAC/European Commission Project and the statements issued at the conclusion of the Interparliamentary Conferences on Mining and Energy in Latin America (CIMEs 97 and 98), which stressed the importance of studying legislative measures to promote the sustainable development of the energy sector and called for a dialogue with the countries of the European Union on this subject. The objective of the meeting was to promote a dialogue among legislators, energy policy-makers, regulators, representatives of power companies, specialized agencies and experts from Europe and Latin America, so that they could share their experiences with legislative measures, regulatory mechanisms, and programmes to promote energy efficiency. In the first chapter, approaches to energy cooperation between Europe and Latin America are analysed. The second chapter takes a look at the development of energy policies in the European Union since the 1970 s, with special emphasis on energy efficiency policies. In the third chapter, legislative measures and regulatory efforts adopted in the European Union are discussed, whereas the fourth chapter deals with the roles of the players involved, the programmes developed in the Member Countries at the Community level, and some important private initiatives. Chapter five analyses European experiences with energy efficiency services, and chapter six covers the progress that has been made in Latin America. The last chapter deals with ECLAC's course of action and conceptual approach with respect to the role of energy efficiency in the sustainable development of the energy sector...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on work carried out for the European-Chinese <b>Synergy</b> <b>programme.</b> It shows how ideas for {{electronically-controlled}} ring-cam pumps with very large torques and variable displacement, which were originally developed for wave energy, {{can be used in}} a tidal-stream generator with a vertical-axis rotor. The arrangement allows all the generation plant to be at the surface in an accessible, sealed compartment at atmospheric pressure. The proposed rotor uses variable-pitch blades where pitch is set by control of the moment about the pitch axis. Hydrostatic bearings use a set of compliant master-slave pads to allow large geometrical distortion. Self-propulsion is possible. Some design parameters are presented. 1. 0 WIND-WATER COMPARISON Although there are some similarities between wind-turbines and tidal-stream ones, it is important to understand several differences. The velocities in the best tidal streams are about one fifth of typical wind cut-out speeds, but over the time-scale of tens of minutes they are much steadier and also accurately predictable. There is less need of storage and easier integration with network planning. Blades in water can suffer cavitation damage which severely limits tip-speed ratios. Water rotors wil...|$|E

First, the main aspects of the methodology used to evaluate individually the synergy of the objectives (performances) are set out by using a Delphi technique. This technique allows to build a matrix of weights, according to the degree of synergy for every objective (performance). Then, hierarchical clusters are applied in the data processing. This technique leads to a ranking of objectives which shows the strategic value of the programme subject to evaluation. The methodological analysis shows also an application of the Community Support Framework (1994 - 1999) for the Spanish Objective 1 regions. ...|$|R

Until now, advocacy for resources has been done {{on the basis of a}} commodity approach that encouraged scaling up of numerous strategies in parallel, irrespective of their relative effects. We propose a strategic investment framework that is intended to support better management of national and international HIV/AIDS responses than exists with the present system. Our framework incorporates major efficiency gains through community mobilisation, <b>synergies</b> between <b>programme</b> elements, and benefits of the extension of antiretroviral therapy for prevention of HIV transmission. It proposes three categories of investment, consisting of six basic programmatic activities, interventions that create an enabling environment to achieve maximum effectiveness, and programmatic efforts in other health and development sectors related to HIV/AIDS. The yearly cost of achievement of universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support by 2015 is estimated at no less than US$ 22 billion. Implementation of the new investment framework would avert 12. 2 million new HIV infections and 7. 4 million deaths from AIDS between 2011 and 2020 compared with continuation of present approaches, and result in 29. 4 million life-years gained. The framework is cost effective at $ 1060 per life-year gained, and the additional investment proposed would be largely offset from savings in treatment costs alone...|$|R

Redistributive cash transfer programmes have emerged as vital for the pursuit of poverty reduction and eradication; however, critics have expressed concerns that such social grants could lead to dependency among beneficiaries, dissuade them from seeking work, or reinforce traditional gender roles. Authors contributing to this issue of Policy in Focus address these concerns head-on, by exploring both the positive and unintended negative impacts of cash transfers on households and communities, while bringing to light some of the persisting challenges related to the limits of cash transfers. This issue introduces readers to research-based evidence on diverse social protection programmes in various countries, as well as current debates on how best to improve social grants. The contributing authors demonstrate the importance of evaluation results to better inform programme reforms and design changes to ensure that beneficiaries exit poverty and reduce their chances of slipping back into it. Furthermore, the following articles also help identify successful and potential <b>synergies</b> between various <b>programmes</b> and initiatives, highlighting the power of cash transfers in combination with other programmes, in order to better inform policymakers and further the discussions about how best to grow in a more inclusive and sustainable manner.

40|$|Introduction: In the mid- 1990 s, Cambodia faced one of {{the fastest}} growing HIV {{epidemics}} in Asia. For its achievement in reversing this trend, and achieving universal access to HIV treatment, the country received a United Nations millennium development goal award in 2010. This article reviews Cambodia's response to HIV over the past two decades and discusses its current efforts towards elimination of new HIV infections. Methods: A literature review of published and unpublished documents, including programme data and presentations, was conducted. Results and discussion: Cambodia classifies its response to {{one of the}} most serious HIV epidemics in Asia into three phases. In Phase I (1991 – 2000), when adult HIV prevalence peaked at 1. 7 % and incidence exceeded 20, 000 cases, a nationwide HIV prevention programme targeted brothel-based sex work. Voluntary confidential counselling and testing and home-based care were introduced, and peer support groups of people living with HIV emerged. Phase II (2001 – 2011) observed a steady decline in adult prevalence to 0. 8 % and incidence to 1600 cases by 2011, and was characterized by: expanding antiretroviral treatment (coverage reaching more than 80 %) and continuum of care; linking with tuberculosis and maternal and child health services; accelerated prevention among key populations, including entertainment establishment-based sex workers, men having sex with men, transgender persons, and people who inject drugs; engagement of health workers to deliver quality services; and strengthening health service delivery systems. The third phase (2012 – 2020) aims to attain zero new infections by 2020 through: sharpening responses to key populations at higher risk; maximizing access to community and facility-based testing and retention in prevention and care; and accelerating the transition from vertical approaches to linked/integrated approaches. Conclusions: Cambodia has tailored its prevention strategy to its own epidemic, established systematic linkages across different services and communities, and achieved nearly universal coverage of HIV services nationwide. Still, the programme must continually (re) prioritize the most effective and efficient interventions, strengthen <b>synergies</b> between <b>programmes,</b> contribute to health system strengthening, and increase domestic funding so that the gains of the previous two decades are sustained, and the goal of zero new infections is reached...|$|R

This research study aimed to determine how programme management coordination amongst the provincial office of the NCDoH, district office and the hospital that did undergo revitalisation through the Hospital Revitalisation Programme (HRP) could be improved. In order to explore the research problem the concepts of construction management and operations management were studied from which factors that impact positively and negatively on programme management coordination were extracted. A rationalist philosophical approach and subjectivist epistemology were utilised. The empirical enquiry was conducted through the case study method to obtain in-depth context of the case. The empirical evidence was obtained through a research interview guide utilising the purposive sampling strategy. The research initiated the sampling procedure by targeting the most relevant managers to the research study in the three units of analysis. A snowball approach evolved for the identification of other managers deemed relevant for purposes of this research. The thesis obtained opinions on the subject matter from managers who participated or were supposed to participate in the implementation of the delivery objectives of the administrative programmes in the NCDoH together with the objectives of the HRP. The research revealed that poor programme management coordination in the NCDoH as a result of internal competition and silo functions which prevent <b>synergy</b> from <b>programme</b> management plan development up to implementation. Furthermore, the complete building infrastructure only attains the objectives of construction management but the building infrastructure are not a complete justification for benefit realisation without the integration of operations management. The NCDoH cannot declare a successful programme management practices if it fails to realise the benefits that require integration of infrastructure and services. It is recommended that in order to attain effective programme management and realise the benefits of strategic objectives there should be a cross-functional approach from executive management which should trickle-down to the lowest level of administration. This research has developed a framework that can be useful in the integration of construction and operations management whereby infrastructure and operational services have to be delivered simultaneously in the field of programme management...|$|R
40|$|The {{greatest}} {{risk factor for}} lung-cancer is smoking, the second largest factor being raised radon levels at home. Initiatives to stop smoking and reduce domestic radon levels have met with some success, but in both cases {{a significant proportion of}} those affected fail to respond. The two risk factors combine, so that those who smoke and live in a house with high radon levels are at higher risk than if exposed to only one of the two threats. There is the potential for combined public health campaigns to better target those affected. Our group has studied both the smoking cessation and radon remediation programmes in Northamptonshire, UK, considering the costs and health benefits of each, and, using postal questionnaires, recording the demographics of participants. Our analysis suggests that the demographics of the two groups are significantly different. Those who remediate tend to be older, include fewer smokers and have fewer children. The health benefits from stopping smoking are greater than those from radon remediation, and the smoking cessation programme costs less per lung-cancer averted. In addition, the continuing reduction in smoking prevalence in the UK will reduce the effectiveness of radon remediation campaigns. This paper discusses the <b>synergy</b> between the <b>programmes,</b> and argues that there is merit in an integrated approach to these health campaigns, and in particular to extending smoking cessation programmes to include advice on reducing the risks from radon...|$|R

The Environmental Long-Term Observatories Network of Southern Africa (ELTOSA) is a regional LTER network of country Environmental Observatories Networks (EON) encompassing the natural environments and their socio-economic context. EON involves the documentation, analysis and information dissemination concerning long-term (decades to centuries), large-scale (ecosystem, biome, continental, global) ecological and socio-economic processes. These are elucidated through multidisciplinary research and monitoring over a network of institutionally operated field observation sites. Basic functions concern fieldwork, data management and sharing, analyses and interpretation, and information dissemination, all operated {{in such a way}} as to benefit most from cooperation among professionals and with resource managers at all levels. Requirements for continuity include programmatic tenure and funding, data archiving, data sharing, training, and networking. EON involves networking at four scales. First, the level of the EON centre inter-connects specific study plots over time and space, and facilitates collaboration between researchers and students using the centre. Second, the country network level inter-connects several institutions and programmes with common goals and activities. Third, the regional network level, such as ELTOSA, promotes subcontinental <b>programmes,</b> <b>synergy,</b> and complementarity.

40|$|The sector-wide {{approach}} (SWAp) {{was introduced to}} increase the impact of donor funds and local management of resources in developing countries. It gained progressively the support of major bilateral donors. In June 1998, the Tanzanian Ministry of Health {{and a group of}} donors adopted a SWAp in order to support health sector reforms and to increase coordination between donors and government. In fine, the main aim of the health reforms was to improve availability and quality of essential health service delivery through one comprehensive and coherent health sector programme. Despite increased attention {{during the past few years}} to explore the gaps between policies and results/outcomes at operational level, scarce evidence has been produced. Our multiple-case study design used mixed methods for data collection and analyses. It intended to evaluate and understand how the health sector reforms supported by a SWAp were implemented, and how they were eventually associated with health system improvements and a better health service delivery to the Tanzanian population. To fulfil that objective, we explored the conditions for success and/or failure of the national policy implementation through an analytical framework with functional links between the national and operational level. Our evaluation supported the fact that the adoption of a health SWAp in Tanzania played a major role in the implementing the health sector reforms. This was particularly true for the decentralisation process and the application of new policy on health financing sources. In addition, the different mechanisms under the framework of the SWAp contributed to strengthen the national health system, analyzed through six building blocks (finance, human resource, information, service, drug and equipment, and governance). At operational level, despite some improvements in the planning, supervision, finance, training, salary, and infrastructures, the overall results remained modest. Several components essential to quality health services, like referral system, working and living conditions, and reliable supplying system did not really improve, and policy implementation of community health fund mechanism failed. Incoherence between policies, lack of preparedness and human capacity buildings, absence of <b>synergy</b> between <b>programmes,</b> and shortcomings in having firm grip on context-reality are some of the policy-implementation gaps pointed out. Those gaps inhibit the success of strategies implementation and threaten the slight progresses already obtained.

40|$|In {{line with}} {{increasing}} global {{efforts to improve}} the first year experience of 3 rd level education Dublin Institute of Technology’s School of Spatial Planning undertook, in both 2007 and 2008, a 2 -day Deep-End Induction project. With the introduction of modularisation in Ireland’s Institutes of Technology opportunities arose for the identification of overlaps and <b>synergies</b> between <b>programmes.</b> Within the authors’ School three honours Bachelor of Science degrees in Geomatics, Spatial Planning and Environmental Management are taught annually. The Geomatics graduates are mainly engaged in the production of maps and models on national, regional and local scale as well as the management of spatial data in Geographic Information Systems and through appropriate Land Management processes. The Environmental Managers and Spatial Planners are prime users of these datasets. All three student groups benefit from the development of an understanding of each of the other disciplines and this led to the introduction of basic modules {{in each of the three}} subject areas, delivered jointly to the three cohorts during semester one of the first year. Experience in the first year of joint delivery of modules (2006) indicated that students had difficulty understanding the relevance of these modules and the reasoning behind the joint delivery. It was also found that few students mixed outside their own cohort even when scheduled in cross-disciplinary teams for assignments and practical work. In an effort to address this issue staff developed an induction project which placed students from the three programmes into teams and tasked them with the design of a route for a high-voltage power line. The students were given a detailed briefing (both en masse and in separate cohorts to explain the specific role of each professional in the design team), were provided with a range of online Irish mapping, environmental and planning tools, and were required to design, visit and evaluate two possible routes to match specific natural, social, engineering or landscape criteria between defined start and end locations. The deliverables were a brief report and a presentation proposing one of the designed routes. The presentation was made to the full cohort of students and staff from across the school and was delivered as if at a Planning Consultation meeting, with each group in turn taking the role of the design team trying to convince an audience of interested local parties of the benefits of their proposal. The real outcomes, however, were the introduction of students to their cohort and the wider grouping of students across the school, to the related disciplines of Spatial Planning, Environmental Management and Geomatics, to a range of tools (both educational, such as the Webcourses VLE, and subject specific), to staff at the school and to some 3 rd level teaching methods. Feedback from students indicated that they found the project to be a success, both from social and educational perspectives, with the Geomatics students seeing less educational and more social relevance, possibly because of the specific topic chosen for investigation. Current anecdotal evidence has shown better mixing between cohorts during joint practical and project work. The authors also intend to carry out a further evaluation of results of the induction project when the students have completed one full stage (2 semesters) of their programmes...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} {{of science and}} technology in South Africa in the next decade has been emphasised in the National R&D strategy, and a target expenditure of one per cent of GDP on R&D has been set. Research programmes in transport in the 1990 s did not yield the expected outcomes and impact due to severe fragmentation of the programmes and subsequent diminished funding and output. Road authorities and the private sector expressed a need for the improvement of the associated management processes. International work in technology management has focused mainly on linear models of managing the development of hard products for the consumer market. These models are not suitable for the road building industry where the majority of the R&D programmes are aimed at the development of new knowledge, engineering methodology and associated engineering solutions. In addition, the R&D process is complex with many elements and interactions, and thus a simple linear management model is unlikely to yield the desired results. This thesis is aimed at the development of a systems-based R&D management model and tools for road engineering and shows that their implementation has a significant impact on R&D outputs. This study evaluated international best practice as well as the success and failure factors of six local R&D programmes. A developmental research approach was used to identify the problem, develop a solution and test the solution in a number of R&D programmes. The model is based on a systems approach, taking aspects of cybernetics and complexity theory into consideration and is radically different from the linear approaches usually followed in the management of the development of consumer products. A set of analysis tools supporting the strategic model was developed. These include a strategic needs determination process, the technology tree tool and a research effectiveness measurement system. The new conceptual model and the associated analysis tools were implemented in four significant research programmes in the public sector, private sector and research organisations. The emphasis was on managing the <b>synergy</b> between the <b>programmes</b> in a holistic approach, thus enhancing the outcome and impact of the programmes.

40|$| {{respect to}} the {{adaptive}} capacity of organic farming are quite important for any policy justification in support of organic farming. And finally, there is the productivity issue. If the actually demand for food stuff is increasing rapidly throughout the world then the obvious limitations of organic farming in this respect reported from industrial countries become more serious. In that context research and development supporting increasing productivity in organic farming might become {{much more important than}} in the past. It is clear that just looking at the originally envisaged targets and objectives might not be sufficient to judge whether or not an action plan has been successful. One key argument going be-yond clear targets and well balanced measures is that embedding action plan development in the wider policy area seems to be absolutely essential to be successful. However, {{there are a number of}} other issues to be dealt with which are also quite important prerequisites for successful organic action plans such as stakeholder involvement, coherence and consistency of action plans and an evaluation monitoring capacity. Stakeholder involvement may be understood and carried out in quite different ways including the provision of information, providing opportunities to comment on proposals, and empowering stakeholders to make their own choices. When preparing the toolbox aimed for evaluating the European Organic Action Plan in the OR-GAP project, attempts were made to involve both organic and mixed stakeholders in various steps in eight different national/regional settings and with different methods. These experiences form the background for recommending stakeholders with a purely organic and/or mixed portfolio to involve through group discussions in order to increase and optimize their analytical capacities and thereby their delivery of relevant information regarding the preconditions for implementing the EUOAP and for assessing its policy impacts. Parallel to this, relevant non-organic stake-holders could be involved on the basis of individual interviews or small group interviews. When deciding on which stakeholders to involve in any stage it is thus necessary to identify all stakeholders considered relevant to the issue and to clarify for each of them which perspective they represent in first priority. Therefore a general model for analysing stakeholder involvement in public policy on organic food and farming has been developed in the project. It includes a distinction of expertise involved in the three main perspectives of organic action plans realised in Europe up to now: the specific values defining organic food and farming; the market perspective as organic food in most plans is expected to develop in response to consumer demand; and a political recognition of the public goods delivered as a consequence of performing organic farming practices. With regard to each of these three perspectives, it is possible to specify expertise of stakeholders acting in the core or periphery of the perspective and to distinguish expertise of purely organic stakeholders and other stakeholders with a mixed or even non-organic expertise relevant for the development of policies in support of organic food and farming. The degree to which participatory methods realise their potential contribution depends critically on how carefully they are used and in what context. There is no one set of techniques to be mechanically applied in all contexts for all participants, but a diverse range of possible techniques which need to be flexibly adapted to particular situations and needs. Stakeholder involvement helps improving the information basis and the legitimacy of public policies. This is especially important on complex issues such as organic action plans, which involves actors with stakes in issues as different as the values of organic food and farming, the food market and the public goods of organic food and farming at one and the same time. Successful stakeholder involvement thus demands: careful preparations of which stakeholders to include at any stage of the policy process and of the methods used to promote participation; sufficient time for the stakeholder to react; this means at least 8 - 12 weeks of time for allowing substantial and broad participation, in particular in the case of involvement of farmers organisations, and good communication and transparency in each of the five stages of the policy process. Although this results in higher costs and more resources for those administrating the process, the outcome of such a process will improve the legitimacy and acceptability of the decisions and will facilitate very much the implementation (e. g. through public private partnerships). Such a more participative, transparent and time-balanced process helps to avoid unnecessary discussions and misunderstandings, which at the end might be more effective and cost-efficient. Project Synthesis For an evaluation of the internal and external coherence of the EU Organic Action Plan (OAP), the ORGAP project team generally made use of empirical methods and techniques suggested for analysing the <b>synergy</b> of <b>programmes</b> as well as their cross-impacts. A policy analysis of key synergies (positive and negative) was performed by means of a matrix of cross impacts as specified in the MEANS framework (EC, 1999). Two separate matrices were constructed: to appraise the internal coherence between the various measures of the EU Organic Action Plan; and to appraise the external coherence between the EUOAP and some national organic action plans. Experts involved in this evaluation process (Evaluation team) identified any synergy which may exist between pairs of measures or categories of measures. The effects of synergies or conflicts have been rated with the help of 2 electronic consultation rounds. After validation of these ratings, the calculation of the “synthetic” coefficient of synergy was performed, in order to evaluate the overall level of synergy/conflict within the European Organic Action Plan. The analysis suggests that Actions 9 (ensure integrity) and 10 (harmonisation of standards) are essential for the success of the EUOAP, given their synergetic effects. They in addition enter into synergy with many other actions. Interesting is also Action 13 (risked based-inspections) wit...|$|R
