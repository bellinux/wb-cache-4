5|$|En Liten Hushålls-Cateches {{came out}} in 1800 and was only 43 pages long. In her last book Rückerschöld {{repeated}} her previous stances {{about the importance of}} knowing household skills, and that girls should be allowed to partake in household work from an early age rather than being pampered and taught impractical skills. While stressing that a woman's God-given station was in the home and that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> accustomed to humility and obedience, she also encouraged women to take matters in their own hands; the lack of household education could only be alleviated by sharing information and passing on knowledge {{from one generation to the}} other.|$|E

Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions.

5|$|Thomas Day was a {{bachelor}} who had inherited his fortune {{from his father}} {{when he was an}} infant. Described as having a face pockmarked from smallpox, a brooding personality, and a short temper, Day attended Corpus Christi College, Oxford, to study philosophy. It was there that he decided to dedicate his life to becoming a virtuous man, shunning luxury and focusing on altruism. Around the same time he developed a list of requirements for his future wife, that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> subservient and pure but also able to discuss philosophy and live without frivolities.

He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> tested for herpes.|$|E
