The cytoskeleton of ancestral algae such as Chara showed similar sensitivity to auxin as higher plants, even in generative structures but the sensitivity differed between IAA and a-NAA and presumably other auxins. The ability of cells to elongate depends on microtubule organization during the transition from disorganized to perpendicular to longitudinal organization of the cytoskeleton. Because of the many functions of the cytoskeleton {{it is possible that}} its composition is inﬂuenced by <b>selective</b> <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> and adaptation to growth regulators.

Previously, we {{have shown}} that {{complexes}} of plasmid DNA with the biodegradable polymer poly(2 -dimethylamino ethylamino) phosphazene (p(DMAEA) -ppz) mediated tumor <b>selective</b> <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> after intravenous administration in mice. In this study, we investigated the effect of p(DMAEA) -ppz molecular weight on both in vitro and in vivo tumor transfection, {{as well as on}} complex induced toxicity. Materials and Methods. p(DMAEA) -ppz with a broad molar mass distribution was fractionated by preparative size exclusion chromatography. Polyplexes consisting of plasmid DNA and the collected polymer fractions were tested for biophysical properties, (cyto) toxicity and transfection activity. Results. Four p(DMAEA) -ppz fractions were collected with weight average molecular weights ranging from 130 to 950 kDa, and with narrow molecular mass distributions (Mw/Mn from 1. 1 to 1. 3). At polymer-to-DNA (N/P) ratios above 6, polyplexes based on these polymers were all positively charged (zeta potential 25 – 29 mV), and had a size of 80 – 90 nm. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the polyplexes positively correlated with polymer molecular weight. The in vitro transfection activity of the different polyplexes depended on their N/P ratio, and was affected by the degree of cytotoxicity, as well as the colloidal stability of the different polyplexes. Intravenous administration of polyplexes based on the high molecular weight polymers led to apparent toxicity, as a result of polyplex-induced erythrocyte aggregation. On the other hand, administration of polyplexes based on low molecular weight p(DMAEA) -ppz_s (Mw 130 kDa) did not show signs of toxicity and resulted in tumor <b>selective</b> <b>gene</b> <b>expression.</b> Conclusion. Polymer molecular weight fractionation enabled us to optimize the transfection efficiency/ toxicity ratio of p(DMAEA) -ppz polyplexes for in vitro and in vivo tumor transfection.

To investigate the role of <b>selective</b> <b>gene</b> <b>expressions,</b> C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery (MCA) clot embolism, followed after 1 hour by intracarotid infusion of 10 mg/kg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) or vehicle. Methods—Before the onset of treatment and at 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours of recirculation, animals were frozen in situ and hsp 70, c-fos, junB, and NSE mRNAs were imaged on cryostat sections using in situ hybridization autoradiography. Cerebral protein synthesis (CPS) and ATP content were measured on adjacent brain sections. Results—hsp 70 mRNA was upregulated in the penumbral cortex of untreated animals and in the MCA core region of animals receiving rtPA (ie, regions characterized by a mismatch between high ATP levels and suppressed CPS). c-fos and junB mRNAs were transiently expressed mainly in the peri-infarct intact cortex for up to 3 to 6 hours in the treated and up to 24 hours in the untreated animals. In both groups, NSE mRNA declined in the central parts of the MCA territory together {{with a loss of}} silver impregnation, but this decline was more pronounced in the untreated animals.

Principal cell-specific neurexin splice isoforms depend on the RNA-binding protein Slm 2.

Here, we show that agrin induces the formation of the dense network of microtubules in the subsynaptic cytoplasm and that this, in turn, regulates acetylcholine receptor insertion into the postsynaptic membrane. Agrin acted in part by locally activating phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase and inactivating GSK 3 ?, which led to the local capturing of dynamic microtubules at agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters, mediated to a large extent by the microtubule plus-end tracking proteins CLASP 2 and CLIP- 170.

40|$|AbstractLevodopa is {{the most}} {{effective}} therapy for the motor deficits of Parkinson's disease (PD), but long term treatment leads to the development of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). Our previous studies indicate enhanced excitability of striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) in mice expressing LID and reduction of LID when ChIs are selectively ablated. Recent gene expression analysis indicates that stimulatory H 2 histamine receptors are preferentially expressed on ChIs at high levels in the striatum, and we tested whether a change in H 2 receptor function might contribute to the elevated excitability in LID. Using two different mouse models of PD (6 -hydroxydopamine lesion and Pitx 3 ak/ak mutation), we chronically treated the animals with either vehicle or l-DOPA to induce dyskinesia. Electrophysiological recordings indicate that histamine H 2 receptor-mediated excitation of striatal ChIs is enhanced in mice expressing LID. Additionally, H 2 receptor blockade by systemic administration of famotidine decreases behavioral LID expression in dyskinetic animals. These findings suggest that ChIs undergo a pathological change in LID with respect to histaminergic neurotransmission. The hypercholinergic striatum associated with LID may be dampened by inhibition of H 2 histaminergic neurotransmission.

P., Charbonneau, H., Bentley, J. K., Walsh, K. A. & Beavo, J. A. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 7940 - 7947]. Southern blot analysis suggests high nucleotide-sequence conservation of the PDE 1 B 1 gene among mammalian and avian species. A single approximately 3600 -nucleotide mRNA transcript was seen in all brain regions, with striatum containing 4 - to 30 -fold higher levels than other areas. In nonneural tissues, low amounts of PDE 1 B 1 mRNA were detected in lung, spleen, thymus, and testis; hybridization to several larger mRNA species was also seen in thymus and testis. By using nucleic acid probes for PDE 1 B 1, the mechanisms that control its highly <b>selective</b> <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> can now be studied at the molecular level...|$|E
40|$|Previously we have {{demonstrated}} that a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) carrying the transgene EGFP can be retargeted to IL- 2 receptor positive tumor cells by a bispecific fusion protein alphaHN-IL- 2 in vitro. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the specificity and efficiency of gene delivery to tumor cells in vivo via this modified RNA virus. Prior ex vivo infection of murine lymphoma cells by the modified virus resulted in selective EGFP expression in IL- 2 R+ target tumor cells in vivo. Direct fluorescence microscopy and immunohistology showed viral replication in target positive tumor tissue resulting in much more EGFP expression than in target negative tumor tissue, 24 h after intratumoral injection of the alphaHN-IL- 2 modified NDV. A quantitative real-time RT-PCR for EGFP mRNA. confirmed the <b>selective</b> <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> in IL- 2 R+ tumor cells. Biodistribution studies showed that EGFP transgene delivery was reduced by 35 - 100 % in liver, spleen, kidney, lung and thymus by the modified virus, while 98 % of the transgene was delivered to IL- 2 R+ tumors. In conclusion, the modification of NDV by the bispecific protein does not compromise severely the efficiency of gene delivery into IL- 2 R-positive tumors, but greatly reduces viral gene expression in IL- 2 R-negative tumors and in normal tissue...|$|E
5000|$|DeMarco's {{regenerative}} medicine {{theory was that}} procaine enables protein de novo synthesis by acting on cellular DNA activity causing epigenetic changes. Equal to salamanders, starfish and similar life-forms, human regeneration would be possible by <b>selective</b> DNA <b>gene</b> <b>expression.</b> His evidence was his human gangrene case study photographs. Although he had made hundreds of animal heart, liver and skin studies, he would always display his patients' results as validation, believing that, [...] "Theory is good, {{but in the end}} you have to produce patient results in a clinical setting." [...] He used time-lapse photography to demonstrate coordinated and accelerated healing while using his procaine-PVP formula. In the photo studies, certain wound healing processes appear visibly delayed while others look to be selectively accelerated in contrast to untreated wounds. Procaine's ability to retard certain wound healing processes has been well researched. He hypothesized that these processes were DNA controlled with procaine interaction. DeMarco believed his chemically induced partial limb regeneration, scar tissue repression and coordinated tissue repair was a significant step forward in human {{regenerative medicine}}.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between protein and regulatory sequence evolution {{is a central}} question in molecular evolution. It is currently not known to what extent changes in <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> are coupled with the evolution of protein coding sequences, or whether these changes differ among orthologs (species homologs) and paralogs (duplicate genes). Here, we develop a method to measure the extent of functionally relevant cis-regulatory sequence change in homologous genes, and validate it using microarray data and experimentally verified regulatory elements in different eukaryotic species. By comparing the genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae, we found that protein and regulatory evolution is weakly coupled in orthologs but not paralogs, suggesting that <b>selective</b> pressure on <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> and protein evolution is quite similar and persists for {{a significant amount of}} time following speciation but not gene duplication. Additionally, duplicates of both species exhibit a dramatic acceleration of both regulatory and protein evolution compared to orthologs, suggesting increased directional selection and/or relaxed selection on both <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> patterns and protein function in duplicate genes...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the molecular {{basis for the}} rapid and robust memory T-cell responses, we examined <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> and chromatin modification by histone H 3 lysine 9 (H 3 K 9) acetylation in resting and activated human naive and memory CD 8 + T cells. We found that, although overall <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> patterns were similar, a number of genes are differentially expressed in either memory or naive cells in their resting and activated states. To further elucidate the basis for differential <b>gene</b> <b>expression,</b> we assessed the role of histone H 3 K 9 acetylation in differential <b>gene</b> <b>expression.</b> Strikingly, higher H 3 K 9 acetylation levels were detected in resting memory cells, prior to their activation, for those genes that were differentially expressed following activation, indicating that hyperacetylation of histone H 3 K 9 {{may play a role}} in <b>selective</b> and rapid <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> of memory CD 8 + T cells. Consistent with this model, we showed that inducing high levels of H 3 K 9 acetylation resulted in an increased expression in naive cells of those genes that are normally expressed differentially in memory cells. Together, these findings suggest that differential <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> mediated at least in part by histone H 3 K 9 hyperacetylation may be responsible for the rapid and robust memory CD 8 + T-cell response...|$|R
