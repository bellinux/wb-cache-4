5|$|By {{this time}} Pierre Christin was {{dividing}} {{his time between}} Paris and Bordeaux, where {{he was working on}} founding the school of journalism at the Institut Universitaire de Technologie (IUT). Meeting up with Mézières one day, Christin <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> work on creating a comic strip together. Both had their experiences in the American West to draw upon but felt, thanks to Lucky Luke, Jerry Spring and Blueberry, that the market for Westerns was already crowded. Instead, Christin <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> turn their hands to science fiction, a genre that, at that time, was not prevalent in French comics. Although Goscinny was not a science fiction fan, he wanted to promote innovation and originality in Pilote and so commissioned them to produce a strip.|$|E
5|$|Dsungaripterids are {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} being specialist molluscivores, using their powerful jaws to crush the shells of molluscs and crustaceans. While this remains the dominant view of dsungaripterid paleobiology today, some have <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were generalistic omnivores eating a variety of hard foods, as dsungaripterids are better adapted to terrestrial movement rather than wading and are found in inland deposits.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan went to Rome in 960, and {{received}} the pallium from Pope John XII. On his journey there, Dunstan's acts of charity were so lavish as to leave nothing {{for himself and his}} attendants. His steward complained, but Dunstan seems to have <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> trust in Jesus Christ.|$|E
50|$|In {{part two}} Metlitzki explores key English medieval texts and <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> either are based entirely on Arabic stories or include {{elements}} from Arabic storytelling <b>that</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been {{loosely based on}} Arabic stories.|$|R

5|$|The Asian subspecies, the {{relatively}} large intermedius also differs in structure and voice, and {{may represent a}} distinct species. Alternatively, it has been <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should be considered subspecies of T. maximus, but they differ in structure, voice {{and the appearance of}} the eye-ring.|$|E
5|$|The raids {{ended in}} mid-1944 on {{the orders of}} Major-General Robert Laycock, the chief of Combined Operations Headquarters. He <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were no longer as {{effective}} and only resulted in the Germans strengthening their beach defences, which could be detrimental to Allied plans.|$|E
5|$|A few {{groups of}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes have only vestigial mitochondria or derived structures: the microsporidians, metamonads, and archamoebae. These groups appear {{as the most}} primitive eukaryotes on phylogenetic trees constructed using rRNA information, which once <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> appeared before the origin of mitochondria. However, this is now known to be an artifact of long-branch attraction—they are derived groups and retain genes or organelles derived from mitochondria (e.g., mitosomes and hydrogenosomes).|$|E
50|$|The {{maturity}} of the Norfolk Island Pine trees <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were {{planted in the}} 19th century, and photographic and documentary evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are likely to date {{to the middle of}} the century, probably planted as a part of the 1860s garden surrounding Francis Bigge's cottage on Shore Street North - the site now occupied by Norfolk Pines home units.|$|R

5|$|After {{moving to}} Los Angeles, Keenan met Adam Jones who had in college heard him singing on a demo. Impressed with Keenan's vocals, Jones <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> form a band. Reluctant, Keenan {{eventually}} agreed and, in 1988, Tool was formed. Fronted by Keenan, the eventual lineup included guitarist Jones; his neighbor, drummer Danny Carey; and bassist Paul D'Amour, {{who would later}} be replaced by Justin Chancellor.|$|E
5|$|Although Timberlake {{expressed}} interest in recording songs with rock influences, Timbaland was initially reluctant to pursue the idea {{because he was not}} accustomed to producing such music. Nonetheless, he <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could produce a handful, since they were afraid of alienating Timberlake's urban fan base. Because of this concern, they produced several reprises, encores and preludes with a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{fair use}} issue, Combs and Bad Boy never raised the legal {{concept of the}} fair use {{doctrine}} in their defense. This decision was questioned by some legal experts: Anthony Falzone of the Fair Use Project at Stanford Law School criticized Combs and Bad Boy for not defending the legality of sampling and <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might have refused to raise such a defense because they feared it could later imperil their {{control over their own}} music.|$|E

5|$|Following the Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Popovac joined the Chetnik movement of Draža Mihailović. Popovac was {{a proponent of}} Bosnian Muslim cooperation with the Chetniks and <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> recruit Muslims into their ranks. In October 1942, he enlisted Italian aid in fighting the communist Partisans, and later visited Prozor to discourage further bloodshed after a Chetnik massacre that took the lives {{of as many as}} 2,500 Muslim and Croat civilians. In early 1943, he led an attack against a Muslim village. Later that year, he was killed in disputed circumstances near the town of Trebinje.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{generally}} accepted Bede's report of Coenred's and Offa's abdications, but Barbara Yorke has <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{may not have}} relinquished their thrones voluntarily. There are instances of kings being forcibly removed and placed in holy orders to make them ineligible for kingship; one such was King Osred II of Northumbria, who was forced into a monastery. On the other hand, if Coenred went willingly, as Bede relates, then the apparently friendly relationship between Offa and Coenred, his overlord, {{makes it clear that}} the relationship between an overlord and his underking was not hostile in every case.|$|E
5|$|In 1502, {{the whole}} Muslim {{community}} of Teruel (part of Aragon bordered with Castile) converted en masse to Christianity, {{even though the}} 1502 edict of conversion for Castilian Muslims {{did not apply to}} them. Harvey <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were pressured by the Castilians across the border, but historian Trevor Dadson argued that this conversion was unforced, caused instead by centuries of contact with their Christian neighbors and a desire for an equal status with the Christians.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{announced plans}} to revisit the idea to expand the playoffs to 14 teams, with the increased revenue gained from the two additional postseason games being used to offset plans to shorten the preseason. The two extra Wild Card games could also be scheduled on the weekend, creating triple-headers on both Saturday and Sunday. Goodell then <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might instead be played on Friday and/or Monday, which may eventually cause scheduling conflicts with games of the new College Football Playoff.|$|E
5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) of {{the mantle}} {{penetrate}} through the mineralized {{layers of the}} valves into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain and it is <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may be storage chambers for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents to deter organisms that stick to the shell or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if petroleum jelly is smeared on the shell, clogging the diverticula.|$|E
50|$|The above dates <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{might have}} reached Dar Sila in 1613 to 1614 A.D.|$|R

50|$|Evidence {{from nearby}} tombs <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they,</b> and Unstan, were built {{sometime}} between 3400 and 2800 BC.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Bennett {{noted that the}} two major morphs of pteranodont present in the Niobrara Formation were {{precisely}} separated in time with little, if any, overlap. Due to this, and to their gross overall similarity, he <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> probably represent chronospecies within a single evolutionary lineage lasting about 4 million years. In other words, only one species of Pteranodon would have been present at any one time, and P. sternbergi (or Geosternbergia) in all likelihood was the direct ancestor species of P. longiceps.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other species}} in genus Scytalopus, the Perijá tapaculo is secretive and {{therefore}} difficult to observe. The call and song {{differ from those}} of most other species in the genus, and the latter is composed of two short churrs repeating up to 65 times at 0.5 to 3second intervals. The diet of the species is little known, but studies of the stomach contents of seven specimens <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> fed exclusively on insects.|$|E
5|$|Longrich et al. {{pointed out}} that the robust forelimbs and {{enlargement}} of a single finger in ingeniine oviraptorids is similar to that seen in modern animals that eat ants and termites, such as anteaters and pangolins, but the morpholology of ingeniine jaws does not support them being insectivorous. The researchers found that the function of ingeniine forelimbs was unclear, but <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could have been used for scratching, tearing, or digging, though not prey capture.|$|E
