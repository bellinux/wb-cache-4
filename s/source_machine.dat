2500|$|The Cheetah first flew in {{the summer}} of 1929 and gained its Certificate of Airworthiness on 17 September, {{registered}} as G-AAJK. [...] Clarke did not live to enjoy his aeroplane, dying the following month in an RAF crash. It passed to Malcolm Hamilton, who took it to the Suffolk Aero Club's meeting in June 1930. [...] It was then sold on to A.C.Thomas and three other airmen of 600 City of London Squadron at RAF Tangmere, who flew it as both biplane and monoplane for about four years. [...] In 1935 it was briefly owned by F.G.Miles and whilst in his care observers noted the difficulty the little engine had in moving the aircraft over bumpy ground. [...] It seems Miles sold the Cheetah in May 1936 to Richard Hopkinson for £10, who converted it into a low-winged monoplane called the Martin Monoplane. [...] Since the Cheetah's wings and tail came from the low winged DH.53, {{it is not surprising that}} this final version, re-registered as G-AEYY, looked very similar to its <b>source</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E

40|$|The 40 -year-old Fermilab Proton <b>Source</b> <b>machines,</b> {{constituted}} by the Pre-Injector, Linac and the synchrotron Booster, {{have been the}} workhorse of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). During this time, the High Energy Physics Program has demanded an increase in proton throughput, especially {{during the past decade}} with the beginning of the neutrino program at Fermilab. In order to achieve a successful program, major upgrades and changes were made in Booster. Once again, the Proton Source has been charged to double their beam throughput, while maintain the present residual activation levels, to meet the laboratory Intensity Frontier program goals until new machines are built and operational to replace the Proton <b>Source</b> <b>machines.</b> This paper discusses the present performance of Booster and the plans involved in reaching even higher intensities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a disciplined method for deriving such case analyses. The method identies problematic cases, shows the translations for the non-problematic cases, and gives con- dence that all cases are considered. The method supports such common architectures as SPARC, MIPS, and PA-RISC, {{and it should}} apply to any tool that analyzes machine instructions. We begin by writing a very simple interpreter for the <b>source</b> <b>machine's</b> code. We then transform the interpreter into an interpreter for a target machine without delayed branches. To maintain the semantics of the program being interpreted, we simultaneously transform the sequence of sourcemachine instructions into a sequence of target-machine instructions. The transformation of the instructions becomes our algorithm for binary translation. We show the translation is correct by reasoning about corresponding states on <b>source</b> and target <b>machines.</b> Categories and Subject Descriptors: D. 3. 4 [Programming Langua...|$|R

50|$|With {{the use of}} a kernel driver (specifically {{a filter}} driver), that {{intercepts}} calls to the filesystem functions, any activity is captured immediately as it occurs. This utilises the same type of technology that real time active virus checkers employ. At this level, logical file operations are captured like file open, write, delete, etc. The kernel driver transmits these commands to another process, generally over a network to a different machine, which will mimic the operations of the <b>source</b> <b>machine.</b> Like block-level storage replication, the file-level replication allows both synchronous and asynchronous modes. In synchronous mode, write operations on the <b>source</b> <b>machine</b> are held and not allowed to occur until the destination machine has acknowledged the successful replication. Synchronous mode is less common with file replication products although a few solutions exist.|$|E
