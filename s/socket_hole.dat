Cameras {{requiring}} flashcubes have a round socket and a round hole for the flashcube's pin, while those requiring Magicubes have a round shape with protruding studs and a square <b>socket</b> <b>hole</b> for the Magicube's square pin.

50|$|The {{church was}} used by both the brethren of the second abbey, a {{dependency}} of St. Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, and as a parish church. <b>Socket</b> <b>holes</b> in the piers of the crossing suggest that, {{as well as a}} rood screen, there was a further screen dividing nave and crossing, such as still exists at Dunster in Somerset.

25|$|Polarization is {{maintained}} by the shape, size, or position of plug pins and <b>socket</b> <b>holes</b> and <b>socket</b> recesses {{to ensure that a}} plug fits only one way into a socket. Lamps with screw bases will connect the shell of the lamp socket to the neutral conductor. Similarly, the single-pole switch of the appliance is connected in series with the energized wire. However, due to the uncertainty, in practice, of which conductor is the neutral, some appliances contain dual-pole switches which interrupt both conductors.|$|R
50|$|Adam is {{the larger}} of the two stones, {{weighing}} an estimated 62 tons, and along with three others formed a four-sided cove. Excavations carried out jointly by the Universities of Leicester, Newport and Southampton University of Southampton in 2000 revealed the <b>socket</b> <b>holes</b> for the other stones which were tightly placed close to Adam. The cove had been open on its south eastern side which faced towards the nearby South Street barrow 130m away. The other stones were destroyed in the post-medieval period by a local landowner.|$|R
50|$|Both {{varieties}} of this connector use two pins with centers spaced 19.0 mm apart. The 6 A variety has pins on the plug with a 4.0 mm diameter with the corresponding <b>socket</b> <b>holes</b> having {{a diameter of}} 4.5 mm. The corresponding dimensions on the 16 A are 4.8 mm and 5.5 mm respectively. Thus a 6 A plug fits into both {{varieties of}} this socket, but the 16 A plug does not fit into the 6 A socket. The 16 A socket will accept all group C plugs, but does not provide grounding.|$|R

50|$|For ball-and-socket joints (also {{known as}} spherical joints), the inner joint is {{a ball and}} the outer joint is a <b>socket,</b> both having <b>holes</b> leading to the {{interior}} of their respective tube ends, {{to which they are}} fused. The ball tip is a hemisphere with a ground-glass surface on the outside, which fits inside of the socket, where the ground glass surface is on the inside. Ball-and-socket joints are labeled with a size code consisting of a number, a slash, and another number. The first number represents the outer diameter in mm of the ball at its base or the inner diameter in millimeters {{at the tip of the}} socket, in both cases where the diameters are their maximum in the joints.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} on using a combo keyboard amp {{as a small}} PA system. First, {{it is hard to}} elevate a keyboard amp's speaker the way most PA speakers can be raised up, using PA system speaker stands with a pole onto which most small- to mid-sized PA speaker enclosures can be mounted using their base-mounted metal <b>socket</b> (a <b>hole</b> in a metal plate). Elevating a PA speaker above the audience helps to ensure that the sound is dispersed to the whole audience; if a combo keyboard amp is used as a small PA, the keyboard amp is typically placed on the floor or raised a bit by placing it on a table. In this scenario, the sound produced by the keyboard amp would be absorbed by the first several rows of audience members, and people {{in the back of the}} venue might not be able to hear the performance. Second, most small, low-wattage keyboard amps do not produce enough volume to clearly project the lead vocals into the venue so that they are at the [...] "front of the mix", a sound preferred in many pop genres. For example, whereas a small PA system for a coffeehouse would typically have 100 watts, a small keyboard combo amp may only be rated at 20 watts. Third, while the vast majority of small PA systems come with two speaker cabinets, most combo keyboard amps have a single speaker cabinet. With two speaker cabinets, even if both are pointing straight out at the audience, this provides better coverage of the room; moreover, the two speaker cabinets can be angled outwards a bit, increasing the arc of coverage better for wide rooms.|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} other {{skeletal}} features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are {{not considered to be}} synapomorphies. For example, as diapsids, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of temporal fenestrae (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the snout and lower jaw. Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated scapula, or shoulder blade; a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in Herrerasaurus); and a perforate acetabulum, or hip <b>socket,</b> with a <b>hole</b> at the center of its inside surface (closed in Saturnalia, for example). Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.|$|R

This posture is due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur. Their erect posture enabled early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that surpassed those of [...] "sprawling" [...] reptiles. Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs. Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including rauisuchians, also had erect limbs but achieved this by a [...] "pillar erect" [...] configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the upper pelvic bone was rotated to form an overhanging shelf.|$|R
