5|$|These 18th-century {{improvements}} to the <b>spinning</b> <b>process</b> meant that handloom weavers were in great demand. but as power looms were introduced in factories in Manchester there was less work for them and there was serious unemployment in the town. In 1827 silk weaving began in Leigh, either {{as the result of}} a dispute or a labour shortage in the Middleton silk industry. William Walker was a middleman who opened the first silk mill in Leigh in 1828, and others quickly followed, including James Pownall and Henry Hilton, whose mill survived until 1926.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} 22, Evans {{moved out}} of wheel-making and became a {{specialist}} in forming the fine wire used in textile cards, which were used to comb fibers {{in preparation for the}} <b>spinning</b> <b>process</b> to make thread or yarn. A desire to increase the efficiency of this process led him to his first invention—a machine which would bend wire into teeth and cut them off rapidly to aid the assembly of cards. George Latimer, then a justice of the peace in Newport, saw its potential and tasked a blacksmith with creating the machine, which became one of Evans's early successes when it was introduced in 1778. Evans wished to go further in mechanizing the production of textile cards by developing a machine which could puncture the leather into which the wire teeth were inserted. His invention greatly speeded the card manufacturing process, producing around 1,500 teeth every minute, though Evans himself was unable to find financial backing to commercialize his invention. Nevertheless, {{over the next two decades}} card manufacturing innovations inspired by Evans's led to the development of automated textile card production, then in great demand due to the growth of the Southern cotton industry. Early pioneers of mechanized textile-card production, including Giles Richards and Amos Whittemore, are thought to have borrowed heavily from his original designs.|$|E

40|$|Metal {{spinning}} {{technology has}} seen a rapid development in recent years. Novel <b>spinning</b> <b>processes,</b> such as non-axisymmetrical spinning, non-circular cross-section spinning and tooth-shaped spinning, are being developed. This has challenged the limitation of traditional spinning technology being used for manufacturing axisymmetrical, circular cross-section, and uniform wall-thickness parts. In this paper, the classification of the traditional <b>spinning</b> <b>processes</b> is proposed based on the material deformation characteristics, the relative position between roller and blank, mandrel spinning and mandrel-free spinning, and temperature of the blank during spinning. The advancement of recently developed novel <b>spinning</b> <b>processes</b> and corresponding tool design and equipment development are reviewed. The classification of the novel <b>spinning</b> <b>processes</b> is proposed based on the relative position between the rotating axes, the geometry of cross-section and the variation of wall-thickness of the spun parts. The material deformation mechanism, processing failures and spun part defects of the aforementioned three groups of novel <b>spinning</b> <b>processes</b> are discussed by analyzing four representative <b>spinning</b> <b>processes</b> of industrial applications. Furthermore, other novel <b>spinning</b> <b>processes</b> and their classification {{as reported in the}} literature are summarized. ...|$|R

25|$|The early {{advances}} in weaving had been halted {{by the lack}} of thread. The <b>spinning</b> <b>process</b> was slow and the weavers needed more cotton and wool thread than their families could produce. In the 1760s, James Hargreaves improved thread production when he invented the Spinning Jenny. By the end of the decade, Richard Arkwright had developed the water frame. This invention had two important consequences: it improved the quality of the thread, which meant that the cotton industry was no longer dependent on wool or linen to make the warp, and it took spinning away from the artisans' homes to specific locations where fast-flowing streams could provide the water power needed to drive the larger machines. The Western Pennines of Lancashire became the centre for the cotton industry. Not long after the invention of the water frame, Samuel Crompton combined the principals of the Spinning Jenny and the Water Frame to produce his Spinning Mule. This provided even tougher and finer cotton thread.|$|E

The term [...] "spinning" [...] is misleading because no rotation of any component occurs, but rather comes from analogy to the textile spinning wheels. Silk production is a pultrusion, similar to extrusion, with the subtlety that the force is induced by pulling at the finished fibre rather than being squeezed out of a reservoir. The unspun silk fibre is pulled through silk glands of which there may be both numerous duplicates and different types of gland on any one spider species.|$|E
2500|$|High {{strength}} wire (typically 4 or 6 gauge {{galvanized steel}} wire), is pulled in a loop by pulleys on the traveler, with one end affixed at an anchorage. When the traveler reaches the opposite anchorage the loop is placed {{over an open}} anchor eyebar. Along the catwalk, workers also pull the cable wires to their desired tension. This continues until a bundle, called a [...] "cable strand" [...] is completed, and temporarily bundled using stainless steel wire. This process is repeated until the final cable strand is completed. Workers then remove the individual wraps on the cable strands (during the <b>spinning</b> <b>process,</b> {{the shape of the}} main cable closely resembles a hexagon), and then the entire cable is then compressed by a traveling hydraulic press into a closely packed cylinder and tightly wrapped with additional wire to form the final circular cross section. The wire used in suspension bridge construction is a galvanized steel wire that has been coated with corrosion inhibitors.|$|E
