2500|$|Backscattered {{electrons}} (BSE) {{consist of}} high-energy electrons {{originating in the}} electron beam, that are reflected or back-scattered out of the <b>specimen</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>volume</b> by elastic scattering interactions with specimen atoms. Since heavy elements (high atomic number) backscatter electrons more strongly than light elements (low atomic number), and thus appear brighter in the image, BSE are used to detect contrast between areas with different chemical compositions. The Everhart-Thornley detector, which is normally positioned {{to one side of}} the specimen, is inefficient for the detection of backscattered electrons because few such electrons are emitted in the solid angle subtended by the detector, and because the positively biased detection grid has little ability to attract the higher energy BSE. Dedicated backscattered electron detectors are positioned above the sample in a [...] "doughnut" [...] type arrangement, concentric with the electron beam, maximizing the solid angle of collection. BSE detectors are usually either of scintillator or of semiconductor types. When all parts of the detector are used to collect electrons symmetrically about the beam, atomic number contrast is produced. However, strong topographic contrast is produced by collecting back-scattered electrons from one side above the specimen using an asymmetrical, directional BSE detector; the resulting contrast appears as illumination of the topography from that side. Semiconductor detectors can be made in radial segments that can be switched in or out to control the type of contrast produced and its directionality.|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the project}} is the {{development}} of an electron optical element which allows for the correction of chromatic and spherical aberration in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Since spatial resolution in an SEM is not only determined by the electron probe size, but also by the <b>interaction</b> <b>volume</b> in the <b>specimen,</b> the low voltage SEM is a very interesting tool. Here the <b>interaction</b> <b>volume</b> is drastically reduced to a few nanometers. In the low voltage regime, however, the resolution of conventional SEMs is rather limited, because of an increased probe size caused by aberrations and diffraction. The spot size for a given beam voltage is essentially influenced by the following parameters: The chromatic lens aberration coefficient C_C, the spherical aberration coefficient C_S, the objective lens aperature #alpha# and the energy width #DELTA#U_P_E of the primary beam.

40|$|Gillespie, John W. Advani, Suresh G. Ultrasonic {{consolidation}} (UC) is {{a promising}} manufacturing method for {{metal matrix composite}} pre-preg tapes or foils that utilizes a layer build-up technique. The process involves three main variables: applied load, oscillation amplitude, and rolling speed. A main advantage {{of this process is}} the ability to manufacture multi-material parts at lower processing temperatures compared to other metal matrix composites processes. A major disadvantage, however, is a lack of understanding of diffusion during the ultrasonic consolidation process, which is expected to affect the microstructure, bond quality, and strength within the interface region. The role of diffusion during the low temperature, short duration ultrasonic consolidation process was explored. First, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) was used to measure concentration profiles of ultrasonically consolidated high purity aluminum and copper through which the interdiffusion coefficients were calculated. It was found that the experimental accelerating voltage {{had a significant impact on}} the measurement of the concentration profiles, and associated interdiffusion coefficients, due to the <b>interaction</b> <b>volume</b> interference. The effect of the <b>interaction</b> <b>volume</b> on the concentration profiles was confirmed through Monte Carlo simulations of electron trajectories, and the error due the <b>interaction</b> <b>volume</b> was quantified. The results showed the diffusion distance was too small for accurate measurements with SEM XEDS even at low accelerating voltages. To significantly reduce the error due to the <b>interaction</b> <b>volume,</b> transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples were prepared using a focused ion beam (FIB) to ensure a uniform thickness. The TEM XEDS concentration profile and images revealed intermetallic phase transformations that occurred during the welding process. TEM images also showed dislocation pile-up located at the subgrain/bulk aluminum interface. This microstructural feature supports continuous dynamic recrystallization of grains through the rearrangement of dislocations. The apparent interdiffusion coefficient closely matched the bulk diffusion concentration profile for the times and temperatures of the ultrasonically consolidated sample. Support for bulk diffusion was independently found through calculating the minimum critical temperature for bulk diffusion dominance over grain boundary diffusion for the grain sizes measured.

40|$|A {{proposed}} device, denoted {{a miniature}} microfluidic biomarker extractor (mu-EX), would extract trace amounts of chemicals of interest from samples, such as soils and rocks. Traditionally, such extractions are performed {{on a large}} scale with hazardous organic solvents; each solvent capable of dissolving only those molecules lying within narrow ranges of specific chemical and physical characteristics that notably include volatility, electric charge, and polarity. In contrast, in the mu-EX, extractions could be performed by use of small amounts (typically between 0. 1 and 100 L) of water as a universal solvent. As a rule of thumb, in order to enable solvation and extraction of molecules, it is necessary to use solvents that have polarity sufficiently close to the polarity of the target molecules. The mu-EX would make selection of specific organic solvents unnecessary, because mu-EX would exploit a unique property of liquid water: the possibility of tuning its polarity to match the polarity of organic solvents appropriate for extraction of molecules of interest. The change of the permittivity of water would be achieved by exploiting interactions between the translational states of water molecules and an imposed electromagnetic field in the frequency range of 300 to 600 GHz. On a molecular level, these interactions would result in disruption of the three-dimensional hydrogen-bonding network among liquid-water molecules and subsequent solvation and hydrolysis of target molecules. The mu-EX is expected to be an efficient means of hydrolyzing chemical bonds in complex macromolecules as well and, thus, enabling analysis of the building blocks of these complex chemical systems. The mu-EX device would include a microfluidic channel, part of which would lie within a waveguide coupled to an electronically tuned source of broad-band electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range from 300 to 600 GHz (see figure). The part of the microfluidic channel lying in the waveguide would constitute an <b>interaction</b> <b>volume.</b> The dimensions of the <b>interaction</b> <b>volume</b> would be chosen in accordance with the anticipated amount of solid sample material needed to ensure extraction of sufficient amount of target molecules for detection and analysis.

40|$|Numerous {{applications}} of high harmonic generation (HHG), such as attosecond pulse synthesis, {{depend on the}} ability to increase the electron recollision energy, which is a quadratic function of the driver wavelength. High-energy infrared pulses obtained from an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) are thus attractive for driving the HHG process, thereby offering the opportunity to yield shorter attosecond pulses. However, the increase in driver wavelength is often outweighed by the poor spatial quality of the OPA source. In this paper, we demonstrate that HHG using OPA signal pulses is significantly improved by spatial filtering in a hollow-core fibre prior to focusing in the gas target in comparison with the unfiltered case. Ion yield measurements in combination with beam profile monitoring in the far field enabled control over the <b>interaction</b> <b>volume.</b> For similar <b>interaction</b> <b>volumes,</b> we observe that with less than half the energy per pulse, the HHG yield can increase by one order of magnitude with spatial filtering.

40|$|Deformation, {{in large}} parts of the middle crust, results in {{strained}} rocks consisting of grains with variable dislocation densities and microstructures which are characterized by gradual distortion and subgrain structures. Post-deformation residence of these rocks at elevated temperatures results in microstructural adjustments through static recovery and recrystallization. Here, we employ a numerical technique to simulate intragrain recovery at temperatures at or below the deformation temperature. The simulation is based on minimization of the stored energy, related to misorientation through local rotation of physical material points relative to their immediate environment. Three temperature- and/or deformation-geometry-dependent parameters were systematically varied: (1) deformation-induced dislocation types, (2) dislocation mobility and (3) size of dislocation <b>interaction</b> <b>volume.</b> Comparison with previously published in situ experiments shows consistency of numerical and experimental results.
