40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of methimazole {{used in a}} <b>single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> was studied in 47 patients during their initial episode of hyperthyroidism, and in an additional eight patients during a relapse of hyperthyroidism. All patients become euthyroid using this method. Mean time required to achieve a euthyroid state was 16. 7 ± 1. 1 weeks in the former group, and 14. 9 ± 2. 9 weeks in the latter. In one patient there was an initial response to <b>single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> therapy, but subsequently split dosage was required for control. The <b>single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> regimen of antithyroid drugs will control hyperthyroidism in most patients.

40|$|The {{safety and}} {{efficacy}} of a <b>single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> of netilmicin plus metronidazole after appendicectomy for gangrenous and perforated appendicitis was compared with the traditional thrice daily dosage. Twenty patients were enrolled in each group. The antibiotics were given intramuscularly for seven days after operation. Eradication of infection was observed in all patients and the postoperative wound sepsis was the same for each group. A significantly higher peak serum netilmicin level was achieved in the group receiving a <b>single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> but nephrotoxicity was not observed. We concluded that the <b>single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> of netilmicin was well tolerated and was as efficacious in this small series as the thrice daily regimen.

40|$|Previous {{approaches}} in malaria treatment fail {{to reduce the}} morbidity and mortality of malaria. Widespread overuse of antimalarial treatment of clinical malaria {{may have contributed to}} increase drug resistance. Moreover, poor compliance or inadequate dosage also selects for parasite resistance. The paradigm of radical treatment using drug combinations may improve the cure rate and compliance, thereby preventing or delaying the emergence of parasites resistant to antimalarial drugs. The ideal combined antimalarial regimen in Indonesia should be safe and tolerated by all age groups, effective and rapidly acting for both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria, short course, good compliance and acceptable, without resistance and/or cross-resistance or, not widely spread use, cost-effective and affordable. Artemisinin derivatives are the best partner drug for combination, with advantages that include: well absorbed, safe and well tolerated, rapidly converted to active metabolite, having very short half-life, broad specificity of action, and extremely potent. Current artemisinin-based combinations which are suitable for Indonesia include: amodiaquine plus artesunate given as <b>single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> for 3 days (AQ 3 +ATS 3), mefloquine plus artesunate given as <b>single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> for 3 days (MQ 3 +ATS 3), lumefantrine/benflumetol plus artemether given as twice daily dose for 3 days (COARTEMETHER), piperaquine plus dihydroartemisinin given as <b>single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> for 2 - 3 days (PPQ 2 - 3 +DHA 2 - 3), and piperaquine plus artemisinin given as <b>single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> for 2 days (PPQ 2 +ATM 2).

50|$|Phenylbutazone has a plasma {{elimination}} half-life of 4-8 hours, {{however the}} inflammatory exudate half life is 24 hours, so <b>single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>dosing</b> can be sufficient, {{although it is}} often used twice per day. The drug is considered fairly non-toxic when given at appropriate doses (2.2-4.4 mg/kg/day), even when used repeatedly.

30|$|<b>Single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>dosing</b> (SDD) however {{might lead}} to greater {{clinical}} efficacy. SDD produces higher peak serum concentrations which increased the rate and proportion of the microbicidal activity (Ali and Goetz 1997). Moreover, the concept of saturation of aminoglycoside uptake into the renal proximal tubule cell also encouraged SDD practice {{with the intention of}} reducing associated nephrotoxicity (Rotstein and Mandell 2004). Additional evidence which showed that laboratory animals manifest less toxicity on SDD rather than MDD (Ali and Goetz 1997) and demonstration of saturation kinetics in the entry of aminoglycosides into the ear (Tran Ba Huy et al. 1986) probably promoted adoption of SDD.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective Non-steroidal {{antiinflammatory}} {{agents are}} commonly used to treat pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis (OA), but have poor gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability. This study compared {{the efficacy of the}} COX- 2 specific inhibitor valdecoxib with naproxen and placebo, in treating symptomatic OA of the hip. Design This multicenter, randomized, double-blind 12 -week study compared the efficacy and tolerability of <b>single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>doses</b> of valdecoxib 5 mg and 10 mg with placebo or naproxen 500 mg BID. Efficacy was assessed by Patient's and Physician's Global Assessment of Arthritis, and the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMasters) OA Individual and Composite Indices. The incidence of adverse events was monitored throughout the study. Results Valdecoxib was clinically and statistically superior to placebo for Patient's and Physician's Global Assessment of Arthritis and for all WOMAC OA Indices over the 12 week study period (P≤ 0. 05). Valdecoxib 10 mg was similar to naproxen in terms of efficacy, and demonstrated greater numerical improvements compared with valdecoxib 5 mg. Valdecoxib 5 mg and 10 mg demonstrated similar tolerability compared to placebo and a lower incidence of GI-related adverse effects compared with naproxen. Conclusions <b>Single</b> <b>daily</b> <b>doses</b> of valdecoxib 5 mg and 10 mg were similar to naproxen and superior to placebo, in treating symptomatic OA of the hip.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this retrospective study was to report the efficacy of a single daily oral dose of phenylpropanolamine (PPA) {{in the treatment of}} urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence (USMI) in bitches.
