5000|$|French Colonel Charles Saladin (1878-1942), {{inventor}} of <b>Saladin</b> <b>box</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The {{distillery}} {{was sold}} to John Dewar & Sons in 1922. Under Dewars it was rebuilt in 1955, replacing the malting floors with a <b>Saladin</b> <b>box,</b> and ending the farming activities on the site. The distillery was expanded in 1966, adding three stills to the three present stills, which were all converted to internal heating in 1970. In 1974 Benrinnes changed its distillation process to a partial triple distillation process. The distillery stopped producing its own malt in 1984 opting to buy malt on the market instead, and removed its <b>saladin</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Scotland there's {{only one}} {{distillery}} that still uses the Saladin box: Tamdhu. This distillery uses two such boxes {{to fill the}} kiln, and two steeps to fill the box. Tamdhu was, incidentally, {{also one of the}} first Scottish distilleries to install a <b>Saladin</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{distillery}} {{closed its}} doors {{for a second}} time in 1939 due to World War II. They did not open again until 1946. Three years later, the distillery installed electrical wiring for the first time into the building, giving up the use of paraffin lamps. In 1958 the distillery went through another major change when the Meal mill closed. In 1961 the distillery ceased the use of their floor maltings and began using new <b>saladin</b> <b>boxes.</b> Five years later they greatly expanded production by tripling the number of coal-fired stills from two to six, outifitting them with steam-heated coils. They continued improvements in 1968 by constructing large mechanical floor maltings next to the distillery that could meet the needs of not only their operation but seven other Scottish Malt Distillers. Glen Ord, however, continued to use their own <b>saladin</b> <b>boxes</b> until 1983.|$|R
50|$|With its eight washbacks, six stills, and a <b>Saladin</b> <b>box</b> to malt the barley, Tamnavulin is {{sufficiently}} equipped with modern distilling technology to produce four million liters of alcohol per year. To increase thermal efficiency, recently distilled spirit {{is used to}} heat incoming wash. The distillation water supply is stored in a subterranean reservoir.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Saladin</b> <b>box</b> {{was invented}} by the French Lt. Colonel Charles Saladin (1878-1942) in the late 1800s to {{overcome}} the problem where {{the roots of the}} malting barley would become entangled if not regularly turned by hand, forming large mats unusable for further processing, as encountered in the earlier system that used artificial air flow to cool the barley in deeper beds designed by Galland.|$|E
50|$|Littlemill {{closed in}} 1929 {{until it was}} bought and reopened by Duncan Thomas in 1931, who experimented at the {{distillery}} with different new techniques. He used a new design of a <b>Saladin</b> <b>box</b> for malting with two ventilation towers and a single kiln. The copper pot stills were aluminium coated, and used rectifying columns instead of swan necks to have greater control over the distillation process, and production switched from a triple distillation to a double distillation technique.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Saladin</b> <b>box</b> is an {{instrument}} used for malting barley. It {{consists of a}} large rectangular container about 50 meters in length, {{and a set of}} vertical screws attached to a crossbar. The crossbar moves horizontally across the length of the container while the motion of the screws raise the barley from the bottom to the top. Combined with mechanical air flow across the barley for cooling, this allows for beds of barley between 60 cm and 80 cm deep to be turned over {{two or three times a}} day. The screws are moved and turned by a system of pulleys and belts.|$|E
