25|$|<b>Singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> {{is highly}} reactive, {{especially}} with organic compounds that contain double bonds. The resulting {{damage caused by}} <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> reduces the photosynthetic efficiency of chloroplasts. In plants exposed to excess light, the increased production of <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> can result in cell death. Various substances such as carotenoids, tocopherols and plastoquinones contained in chloroplasts quench <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> and protect against its toxic effects. In addition to direct toxicity, <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> acts a signaling molecule. Oxidized products of β-carotene arising from the presence of <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> act as second messengers that can either protect against <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> induced toxicity or initiate programmed cell death. Levels of jasmonate {{play a key role}} in the decision between cell acclimation or cell death in response to elevated levels of this reactive oxygen species.|$|E

In the manganese mechanism and the donor side mechanism, reactive oxygen species do not play a direct role.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of photodynamic effect (PDE) for Photofrin II (PfII), Verteporfin, and Merocyanine 540 (MC 540) was compared against neoplastic cells. Triplet state lifetimes and <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> quantum yields {{were correlated with}} biological effect. PfII triplet lifetime was two times longer than that of Verteporfin, however, its <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> quantum yield was two times lower in comparison with Verteporfin. High <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> quantum yield of Verteporfin resulted in high biological efficacy. To achieve 50 % mortality of cells four times lower light dose and five times lower concentration of Verteporfin were applied in comparison with PfII. The same level of cell damage was reached using 10 times higher light dose and two times higher concentration of MC 540 in comparison with PfII. Our results confirm that <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> based mechanism, prevalent for Verteporfin and PfII, was highly effective against melanoma cells.

Atomic <b>oxygen</b> and <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> are significantly important {{for the treatment of}} protein by RF oxygen plasma. The reduction rate of the protein was analysed by FTIR spectra, and the light emitted from oxygen plasma was detected by spectrometer. The ratio of emission intensity from atomic <b>oxygen</b> and <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> strongly depended upon the pressure in the chamber. Irradiation time of the oxygen plasma was obviously related to the reduction rate of the protein. It was found that the reduction rate of protein correlated with the light intensity from atomic oxygen at 777 nm and <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> at 762 nm...|$|R

40|$|Fullerenes C 60 and C 70 {{are known}} to produce large {{quantities}} of excited <b>singlet</b> delta <b>oxygen</b> if irradiated with white light in an oxygen atmosphere. This {{is the basis of}} the idea of a Fullerene-Oxygen-Iodine-Laser, where the chemical excitation of <b>singlet</b> delta <b>oxygen</b> is substituted by a fullerene based photocatalytic concept. In this work two different generator concepts were investigated using solid and gaseous fullerenes. The efficiency of each concept was proved by emission of <b>singlet</b> delta <b>oxygen</b> at 1268 nm and of iodine at 1315 nm. The results indicate a low efficiency of singlet delta formation at thin fullerene films, probably caused by adsorption layers.

40|$|Photodynamic {{damage of}} Neurospora crassa conidia was {{studied in the}} {{presence}} of the photosensitizing dye, toluidine blue O. Conidia which germinated to form colonies decreased in number as irradiation time became longer. The photoinactivation of conidia was suppressed by azide, bovine serum albumin, and histidine, and was stimulated in deuterium oxide. Wild-type conidia were less sensitive to the irradiation than albino conidia. In the wild-type, carotenoid-enriched conidia were more resistant against the lethal damage than the conidia which contained small amounts of carotenoids. These results suggest that <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> causes photodynamic lethal damage to N. crassa conidia and that <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> is quenched by endogenous carotenoids...|$|R

25|$|The {{molecule}} {{is excited}} with near infrared radiation to the singlet state (with no unpaired electrons).

25|$|Ozone, {{along with}} {{reactive}} forms of oxygen such as superoxide, <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen,</b> hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorite ions, is naturally produced by {{white blood cells}} and other biological systems (such as the roots of marigolds) {{as a means of}} destroying foreign bodies. Ozone reacts directly with organic double bonds. Also, when ozone breaks down to dioxygen it gives rise to oxygen free radicals, which are highly reactive and capable of damaging many organic molecules. Moreover, it is believed that the powerful oxidizing properties of ozone may be a contributing factor of inflammation. The cause-and-effect relationship of how the ozone is created in the body and what it does is still under consideration and still subject to various interpretations, since other body chemical processes can trigger some of the same reactions. A team headed by Paul Wentworth Jr. of the Department of Chemistry at the Scripps Research Institute has shown evidence linking the antibody-catalyzed water-oxidation pathway of the human immune response to the production of ozone. In this system, ozone is produced by antibody-catalyzed production of trioxidane from water and neutrophil-produced <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of photochemical kinetics in colloidal systems {{is important in}} understanding environmental photochemistry on dispersed solid surfaces. As model materials for the chemically sorbed organic compounds present in natural environments, modified silica nanoparticles (NPs) were obtained here by condensation of the silanol groups of fumed silica nanoparticles with 4 -methoxybenzyl alcohol. These particles were characterized by different techniques. To evaluate their toxicity, the inhibition of the natural luminescence emission of the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri in suspensions of the particles was measured. Laser flash-photolysis experiments (lambda(exc) = 266 nm) performed with NP suspensions in acetonitrile-aqueous phosphate buffer mixtures showed {{the formation of the}} lowest triplet excited state of the chemisorbed organic groups (lambda(max) = 390 nm). DFT calculations of the absorption spectrum of this radical support the assignment. From the calculated triplet energy, a thermodynamically favorable energy transfer from these triplet states to <b>oxygen</b> to yield <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> is predicted. A value of 0. 09 was measured for the quantum yield of <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> generation by air-saturated suspensions of the nanoparticles in the mixture of solvents acetonitrile-aqueous phosphate buffer.

40|$|A {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) method for the determination of four different flavonoids, rutin, morin, quercetin, and 3 -hydroxyflavone in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposome solutions hasbeen developed. The method allows to quantify theirconsumption upon reaction with <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen.</b> The actual HPLC method uses an isocratic elution and detection. The chromatographic separation of these components is achieved using a C 18 analytical column with a water:acetonitrile:acetic acid mixture 74. 5 : 24. 5 : 1 v/v. The peaks for the four flavonoids are well resolved and free from matrix interference and reaction products. The method {{has been found to}} be linear (r > 0. 999) overa wide concentration range and reliable to perform kineticstudies in which <b>singlet</b> molecular <b>oxygen</b> is involved and the time dependent consumption of flavonoids in a microorganized system composed by lipidic surfactants is monitored...|$|R
25|$|Strong light {{causes the}} {{reduction}} of the plastoquinone pool, which leads to protonation and double reduction (and double protonation) of the QA electron acceptor of Photosystem II. The protonated and double-reduced forms of QA do not function in electron transport. Furthermore, charge recombination reactions in inhibited Photosystem II are expected to lead to the triplet state of the primary donor (P680) more probably than same reactions in active PSII. Triplet P680 may react with oxygen to produce harmful <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Photoinhibition {{can also}} be induced with short flashes of light using either a pulsed laser or a xenon flash lamp. When very short flashes are used, the photoinhibitory {{efficiency}} of the flashes depends on the time difference between the flashes. This dependence has been interpreted {{to indicate that the}} flashes cause photoinhibition by inducing recombination reactions in PSII, with subsequent production of <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen.</b> The interpretation has been criticized by noting that the photoinhibitory efficiency of xenon flashes depends on the energy of the flashes even if such strong flashes are used that they would saturate the formation of the substrate of the recombination reactions.|$|E
25|$|The first {{measurements}} of photoinhibition {{were published in}} 1956 by Bessel Kok. Even {{in the very first}} studies, it was obvious that plants have a repair mechanism that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage. In 1966, Jones and Kok measured the action spectrum of photoinhibition and found that ultraviolet light is highly photoinhibitory. The visible-light part of the action spectrum was found to have a peak in the red-light region, suggesting that chlorophylls act as photoreceptors of photoinhibition. In the 1980s, photoinhibition became a popular topic in photosynthesis research, and the concept of a damaging reaction counteracted by a repair process was re-invented. Research was stimulated by a paper by Kyle, Ohad and Arntzen in 1984, showing that photoinhibition is accompanied by selective loss of a 32-kDa protein, later identified as the PSII reaction center protein D1. The photosensitivity of PSII from which the oxygen evolving complex had been inactivated with chemical treatment was studied in the 1980s and early 1990s. A paper by Imre Vass and coworkers in 1992 described the acceptor-side mechanism of photoinhibition. species promote chlorophyll triplet formation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA|volume=89| year=1992|pages=14081412 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.4.1408|issue = 4}} Measurements of production of <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> by photoinhibited PSII provided further evidence for an acceptor-side-type mechanism. The concept of a repair cycle that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage, evolved and was reviewed by Aro et al. in 1993. Many details of the repair cycle, including the finding that the FtsH protease {{plays an important role in}} the degradation of the D1 protein, have been discovered since. In 1996, a paper by Tyystjärvi and Aro showed that the rate constant of photoinhibition is directly proportional to light intensity, a result that opposed the former assumption that photoinhibition is caused by the fraction of light energy that exceeds the maximum capability of photosynthesis. The following year, laser pulse photoinhibition experiments done by Itzhak Ohad's group led to the suggestion that charge recombination reactions may be damaging because they can lead to production of <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen.</b> The molecular mechanism(s) of photoinhibition are constantly under discussion. The newest candidate is the manganese mechanism suggested 2005 by the group of Esa Tyystjärvi. A similar mechanism was suggested by the group of Norio Murata, also in 2005.|$|E

500|$|<b>Singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> {{is a name}} {{given to}} several higher-energy species of {{molecular}} [...] {{in which all the}} electron spins are paired. It is much more reactive with common organic molecules than is molecular oxygen per se. In nature, <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis, using the energy of sunlight. It is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength, and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen. Carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms (and possibly animals) {{play a major role in}} absorbing energy from <b>singlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues.|$|E
500|$|The first type is the oxygen-dependent {{production}} of a superoxide, [...] which is an oxygen-rich bacteria-killing substance.

The 1 O 2 formation rate is compared with that expected from the low probability (1 %) of intersystem crossing of the photosensitizers. The quantum yield for triplet population and the triplet lifetime of the investigated dyes is measured by using a laser-scanning-microscopy technique.

It results that {{the formation of}} 1 O 2 can be prevented effectively by quenching of the S 1 or T state of the photosensitizer. The influence of the molecular ground-state oxygen 3 O 2 concentration [3 O 2] is investigated.
