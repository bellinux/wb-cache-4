A {{pump seal}} failed at the Cove Point LNG import facility, {{releasing}} natural gas vapors (not LNG), which entered an electrical conduit. <b>A</b> worker <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker, which ignited the gas vapors. The resulting explosion killed a worker, severely injured another and caused heavy {{damage to the}} building. A safety analysis was not required at the time, and none was performed during the planning, design or construction of the facility. National fire codes were changed {{as a result of}} the accident.|$|R

As such the numbers of IGs in a power system are increasing hence posing power quality problems. When large numbers of IGs are switched on or <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> from <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> give rise to transients in the power system.

50|$|The {{objective}} of the flight was to test {{the performance of the}} aircraft in simulated engine failures after takeoff, which meant throttling down one of the aircraft's engines to idle and <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> hydraulic <b>circuit.</b> During most of the tests, the aircraft's autopilot would be set to fly the plane to an altitude of 2000 ft. The particular test that led to the crash flew in a configuration with the plane's center of gravity near its aft limit, achieved by carrying tons of water in bladders {{in the rear of the}} aircraft's cabin.|$|R
40|$|The {{disconnectors}} {{belong to}} elements {{widely used in}} electrical power engineering and apparatus technology for disconnecting various electric circuits. Usually they work without voltage (the circuit is first <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> by <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker). Nevertheless, in a fault regime the contacts of the disconnector may carry the full voltage, which may result in the electric arc between them {{at the moment when}} the movable contact approaches to the fixed one. In order to estimate this moment it is necessary to know the time evolution of the electric field in the domain between both contacts. This problem is solved in 3 D (in somewhat simplified geometry) by the integral technique. The theoretical analysis is supplemented with an illustrative example whose results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|On {{the seventh}} day of STS- 110, Mission Specialists Steven Smith and Rex Walheim are shown {{preparing}} for their second extravehicular activity (EVA) and the third of the mission, {{with the assistance of}} Mission Specialist Jerry Ross. Following this mission, Ross and Smith will be the first and second most experienced spacewalkers, respectively, in history. A camera mounted on the Space Shuttle Atlantis shows footage of the International Space Station. While Smith and Walheim are on EVA, Mission Specialists Ross and Lee Morin will provide choreography from inside the Atlantis crew cabin, Pilot Stephen Frick will operate the robotic arm, and Commander Mike Bloom will control the cameras on the robotic arm. Smith and Walheim are shown exiting the airlock hatch and then installing an PFR (Portable Foot Restraint) {{on the end of the}} robotic arm, from which much of the work will be done. Following the <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> of <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker, the main EVA task of rewiring umbilical cables that provide power, commands, and video is begun. These cables will be connected to the Mobile Transporter's (MT) robotic arm. The MT, an external transportation system which runs on rails, is seen with a helmet mounted camera as the astronauts work to release bolts that had served to secure the MT during launch. After a final check of the umbilical connections mated, the Umbilical Reconfiguration Panel is fitted over the cables, and the astronauts make their way to the airlock hatch...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} a {{modeling}} of components and calculation of transient overvoltages that build up on the trans-former primary terminals after the transformer has been <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> by <b>a</b> vacuum <b>circuit</b> breaker (VCB). The transformer is con-nected to the <b>circuit</b> breaker by <b>a</b> cable. The transient overvoltages are calculated for different cable lengths, and the cumulative prob-ability of different arc angles is investigated. In this study two cases are considered: transient overvoltages due to steady-state magnetizing current switching, and transient overvoltages due to inrush current switching. It is shown that the case of inrush current switching is worse, as virtual current chop-ping is possible. The cable is modeled by pi sections, whereas the transformer model {{is based on a}} terminal impedance. The VCB re-ignitions are modeled by means of withstand voltage character-istics and high-frequency quenching capability. Due to shortage of field tests, this work uses only literature references to compare the results with actual measurements. Index Terms—Modeling, overvoltage, transformer, VCB. I...|$|R
40|$|Circuit {{breakers}} {{are widely}} used in commercial and industrial installations for automatically <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> short <b>circuit</b> current. Arc motion in low voltage (240 VAC) high current (103 - 104 <b>A.)</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers is dominated by arc root mobility. This study provides a vital step {{in the development of}} a consistent arc structure and motion in circuit breakers operating at low contact opening velocity. The experimental investigations focus on the influence of the contact material, arc chamber material, contact velocity, power supply polarity, the gap behind the moving contact and the peak short circuit current level on the arc motion. The gas flows and gas composition effects are inspected. This thesis concentrates on the arc commutation at reduced contact opening velocity down to 1 m/s from a moving contact and in particular the point at which the arc root moves off from the contact region To investigate the arc root motion, the Flexible Test Apparatus (FTA) is used to simulate circuit breaker operation. The Arc Imaging System (AIS) is used to record series of the arc motion. New pressure transducers and a spectrometer are used to observe the gas flow and gas composition in the contact region. This data combination provides a new insight into the arc motion. The studies have observed that the gas flow in the region of the moving contact has been shown to affect the arc root mobility. The spectral emission from the arc gases confirms the presence of electronegative species. Experimental results are presented which include the measurements of pressures in the arc chamber, arc spectrum, and arc root motion. The interrelation of gas dynamic and magnetic forces is investigated further by developing relationships between electromagnetic forces and high temperature gas dynamic flows. New semi-empirical modelling is presented in terms of electrical and thermal energy transfer between the arc and the gas flow. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
