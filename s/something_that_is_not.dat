25|$|Every {{directed}} path graph {{with an even}} number of vertices is skew-symmetric, via a symmetry that swaps the two ends of the path. However, path graphs with an odd number of vertices are not skew-symmetric, because the orientation-reversing symmetry of these graphs maps the center vertex of the path to itself, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> allowed for skew-symmetric graphs.|$|E
25|$|Open {{subtitles}} {{as seen in}} Japanese variety {{television shows}} are more for decorative purpose, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> seen in television in Europe and the Americas. Some shows even place sound effects over those subtitles. This practice of subtitling has been spread to neighbouring countries including South Korea and Taiwan. ATV in Hong Kong once practiced this style of decorative subtitles on its variety shows when it was owned by Want Want Holdings, the company that owns Taiwanese broadcasters CTV and CTI through the subsidiary China Times Media Group.|$|E
25|$|In My Life and Work Ford speaks (briefly) {{of racing}} {{in a rather}} dismissive tone, as <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> at all a good measure of {{automobiles}} in general. He describes himself as someone who raced only because in the 1890s through 1910s, one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing {{was the way to}} prove the worth of an automobile. Ford did not agree. But he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success (flawed though the definition was), then his cars would be the best that there were at racing. Throughout the book, he continually returns to ideals such as transportation, production efficiency, affordability, reliability, fuel efficiency, economic prosperity, and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry, but rarely mentions, and rather belittles, the idea of merely going fast from point A to point B.|$|E

25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E
25|$|Distraction from sadness using {{art therapy}} {{may be a}} better {{alternative}} than venting sadness. Two studies by Drake and Winner (2012) published from the American Psychological Association compared venting (expressing negative feelings) and distraction (expressing <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> related to negative feelings) in one study. To distract oneself, the participants were told to draw something unrelated to a sad film they had watched. The participants who had vented were told to draw something related to the film. In study 2, the participants were told to think of a sad event and were put into the venting, distraction, and calming position or sitting conditions. The sitting condition allowed the passage of time to be evaluated. In study 1, the distraction method in which the participants drew something unrelated to the sad film significantly improved negative mood compared to the venting condition. In study 2, the distraction method in which the participants drew a house (something unrelated to the sad event), had significantly improved negative mood compared to venting (drawing the sad event) or the sitting condition (sat quietly for 10 minutes). Therefore, art therapy could be beneficial to people suffering from depressive moods through a way of distraction rather than venting.|$|E

500|$|While {{there are}} certain aspects readers can almost always expect in García Márquez's writing, like {{instances}} of humour, he did not stick to any clear and predetermined style template. In an interview with Marlise Simons, García Márquez noted:In every book I {{try to make a}} different path [...] One doesn't choose the style. You can investigate and try to discover what the best style would be for a theme. But the style is determined by the subject, by the mood of the times. If you try to use <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> suitable, it just won't work. Then the critics build theories around that and they see things I hadn't seen.

500|$|Irish cricket has {{experienced}} a migration {{of some of its}} players to the English county cricket system, where teams representing 18 of the traditional counties of England compete. Players such as Ed Joyce who has played ODI cricket for England have left Ireland to take up cricket as a profession in England, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> possible in Ireland as there is no professional infrastructure. On occasion, some of Ireland's players notably captain William Porterfield (Gloucestershire), batsman Eoin Morgan (Middlesex), wicket-keeper Niall O'Brien (Northamptonshire), and bowler Boyd Rankin (Warwickshire) have been unavailable to play due to commitments to their county side, weakening the national side. Some players, such as Morgan, went on to qualify for England. Ireland, having won a hat-trick of ICC Intercontinental Cup titles since 2005, have been labelled the [...] "leading associate".|$|E
500|$|Of his {{decision}} not to show the heist itself, Tarantino {{has said that the}} reason was initially budgetary but that he had always liked the idea of not showing it and stuck with that idea {{in order to make the}} details of the heist ambiguous. He has said that the technique allows for the realization that the film is [...] "about other things", a similar plot outline that appears in the stage play Glengarry Glen Ross and its film adaptation in which the mentioned robbery is never shown on camera. Tarantino has compared this to the work of a novelist, and has said that he wanted the film to be about <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> seen and that he wanted it to [...] "play with a real-time clock as opposed to a movie clock ticking".|$|E

500|$|The {{day after}} al-Sharif's arrest, another woman was {{detained}} for driving a car. She drove with two women passengers in Ar Rass and was detained by traffic {{police in the}} presence of the CPVPV. She was released after signing a statement that she would not drive again. In reaction to al-Sharif's arrest, several more Saudi women published videos of themselves driving during the following days. On 26 May, authorities said that al-Sharif would remain in detention until 5 June 2011, according to Waleed Abu Al-Khair. Al-Sharif was conditionally freed on 30 May. Her lawyer Adnan al-Saleh said that she had been charged with [...] "inciting women to drive" [...] and [...] "rallying public opinion". The conditions of Al-Sharif's release include bail, returning for questioning if requested, not driving and not talking to the media. As possible reasons for al-Sharif's early release, The National cited al-Sharif having written a letter to King Abdullah, 4,500 Saudis signing an online petition to the King, and [...] "an outpouring of indignation and disbelief by both Saudis and critics abroad that Ms al-Sharif was jailed for <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a moral or criminal offence." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2011, Warner Bros. hired Seth Grahame-Smith, who {{collaborated with}} Burton on Dark Shadows and , {{to write and}} produce a sequel to Beetlejuice.

[...] He was also adamant that Keaton would return and that Warner Bros. would not recast the role. Burton and Keaton have not officially signed on but will return if the script is good enough. Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, [...] "We talked {{for a couple of hours}} and talked about big picture stuff. It's a priority for Warner Bros. It's a priority for Tim. [...] been wanting to do it for 20 years and he'll talk to anybody about it who will listen." [...] The story will be set in a real time frame from 1988; [...] "This will be a true 26 or 27 years later sequel.

500|$|According to the directors, [...] " [...] patronizing quality" [...] {{was vital}} to Scar's {{role in the}} film. Minkoff told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "When Scar puts the guilt trip on Simba, that's an intense idea... {{probably}} <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> typical of the other Disney pictures, {{in terms of what}} the villain does." [...] Additionally, Scar serves as a departure from previous Disney villains because they [...] "came off at least as buffoonish as they were sinister". Because Scar is the film's main antagonist, supervising animator Andreas Deja believed that [...] "villains work really well when they're subtle", explaining, [...] "to see them think and scheme and plot is much more interesting than showing them beating somebody up." [...] By blaming Mufasa's death on an innocent Simba, Scar ultimately triggers [...] "a cycle of guilt, flight, denial and redemption, as the hero goes into self-imposed exile before finally reconciling with his father's memory, returning to face his wicked uncle and generally coming of age." [...] The character's first line in The Lion King essentially summarizes the entire film, providing foreshadowing. It reads, [...] "Life's not fair is it? You see I-well, I... shall never be King. And you... shall never see light of another day," [...] subtly revealing the plot as well as [...] "the reason why [...] decides to murder his own brother." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical receptions {{towards the}} music video were positive. Jillian Mapes of Billboard {{believed}} that the video is [...] "appropriately understated" [...] {{considering the fact that}} the song is all about making an apology. The Improper noticed that the video has [...] "the look and feel of a Hallmark movie and is almost as maudlin," [...] while Amos Barshad of the New York felt that the video was [...] "terrible." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV described the video as [...] "a bummer", writing [...] " [...] isn't just about a girl with her calendar permanently stuck on the twelfth month of the year. It's not just about feeling like a Lady Antebellum song. It's about getting stuck in a place of romantic regret." [...] In a different perspective, Kyle Anderson of MTV argued that the music video puts Swift in a [...] "pantheon of modern classics" [...] with regards to its [...] "almost haunting visual sense" [...] which makes up for the inadequate narrative. Leah Collins of Dose.ca called the music video as [...] "dreamy and moody". Her points are echoed by Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, who deemed the video as [...] "kind of lovely", which corresponds with the melancholic yet regretful mood of the song. Joycelyn Vena of MTV noticed that the video is [...] "darker" [...] and [...] "somber", <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> synonymous with Swift. Yet, The Oxonian Review considers Swift's [...] "listlessness, the bare trees, and snowy indoors" [...] in the music video attuned to the tenor of the song, achieved by [...] "mixing wide shots, medium close ups, and cut-ins of Ms Swift and her ex, matching their gazes across frames, and blurring focus tastefully." ...|$|E
