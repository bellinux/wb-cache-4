However, there is speculation that it may also grow elsewhere in Europe.

500|$|Gymnopilus maritimus {{is known}} {{only from a}} single site in Pittulongu, an area of Olbia, in Sardinia, Italy, which is the type locality. There, {{mushrooms}} were found growing in close groups and tufts on coastal sand dunes around [...] from the high tide line. They were observed {{at the base of}} live Juncus maritimus (<b>sea</b> <b>rush)</b> plants, growing on sandy soil or decaying plants, where they were feeding as saprotrophs. As such, {{it is possible that the}} species would be able to grow on other substrates. They were observed growing from autumn to winter, between the end of October and January. In addition to the collections in Sardinia, Contu and Vizzini speculate that reports of G. fulgens growing in [...] "sand-dune heaths" [...] on Great Britain, an unusual habitat for that species, may in fact show the presence of G. maritimus on the island.|$|E

60|$|Lying {{as it did}} {{so close}} to the sea-level, the Krakatoa volcano, having blown away all its cones, and vents, and safety-valves--from Perboewatan southward, except the peak of Rakata--let the <b>sea</b> <b>rush</b> in upon its infernal fires. This result, {{ordinary}} people think, produced a gush of steam which caused the grand terminal explosions. Vulcanologists think otherwise, and with reason--which is more than can be said of ordinary people, who little know the power of the forces at work below the crust of our earth! The steam thus produced, although on so stupendous a scale, was free to expand and therefore went upwards, no doubt in a sufficiently effective gust and cloud. But nothing worthy of being named a blow-up was there.|$|E
60|$|Finding {{that the}} fire {{continued}} to gain strength, the captain ordered the ship to be scuttled; in other words, to be flooded by opening the lower ports and letting the <b>sea</b> <b>rush</b> in. The ship {{was one of those}} old East Indiamen, which in former days carried guns and marines like our men-of-war. The ports were soon knocked out, and the sea burst in, foaming and splashing like a mill-race when the sluice is drawn as it swept towards the hold, carrying boxes, bulk-heads, loose furniture and all before it. When it poured in a mighty cataract into the hold, the terrified multitude that crowded the upper deck entertained the hope for a few minutes {{that the fire}} would certainly be put out. Their hope was quickly crushed, for the ship soon gave signs of being waterlogged and threatened to settle down, rendering it necessary to close the ports before the fire was subdued.|$|E
60|$|Between {{the crowded}} houses of Gravesend and the monstrous red-brick {{pile on the}} Essex shore the ship is {{surrendered}} fairly to the grasp of the river. That hint of loneliness, that soul of the sea which had accompanied her {{as far as the}} Lower Hope Reach, abandons her {{at the turn of the}} first bend above. The salt, acrid flavour is gone out of the air, together with a sense of unlimited space opening free beyond the threshold of sandbanks below the Nore. The waters of the <b>sea</b> <b>rush</b> on past Gravesend, tumbling the big mooring buoys laid along the face of the town; but the sea-freedom stops short there, surrendering the salt tide to the needs, the artifices, the contrivances of toiling men. Wharves, landing-places, dock-gates, waterside stairs, follow each other continuously right up to London Bridge, and the hum of men's work fills the river with a menacing, muttering note as of a breathless, ever-driving gale. The water- way, so fair above and wide below, flows oppressed by bricks and mortar and stone, by blackened timber and grimed glass and rusty iron, covered with black barges, whipped up by paddles and screws, overburdened with craft, overhung with chains, overshadowed by walls making a steep gorge for its bed, filled with a haze of smoke and dust.|$|E

60|$|The Farne Islands are peculiarly dangerous.

500|$|During the afternoon, air {{pressure}} decreases {{over the land}} as the warmer air rises. The relatively cooler air over the <b>sea</b> <b>rushes</b> in to replace it. [...] The result is a relatively cool onshore wind. This process usually reverses at night where the water temperature is higher relative to the landmass, leading to an offshore land breeze. However, if water temperatures are colder than the land at night, the sea breeze may continue, only somewhat abated. This is typically the case along the California coast, for example.|$|R

5000|$|Juncus kraussii {{commonly}} known as salt marsh rush, <b>sea</b> <b>rush,</b> jointed rush, matting rush or dune slack rush, is of the monocot family Juncaceae and genus Juncus. It grows in Salt marshes, estuarine and coastal areas. [...] This species is ideal as a stabilizer in estuary banks and riparian zones that adjoin developed areas it prevents erosion and provides an excellent fibre for weaving. The plant is named after a German naturalist and museum curator, Christian Krauss, who travelled to South Africa.|$|E
50|$|The lower reaches - {{the tidal}} part - of Wolli Creek {{are home to}} a plant {{community}} known as saltmarsh, or coastal saltmarsh. The plant community includes various salinity-tolerant species such as Knobby Club-rush (Ficinia nodosa), Samphire (Sarcocornia quinqueflora), <b>Sea</b> <b>Rush</b> (Juncus kraussii), Seablite (Suaeda australis), Streaked Arrowgrass (Triglochin striata) and others. Coastal saltmarsh has been recognised as a carbon sink {{as well as a}} filter of nutrients maintaining water quality and is listed as an Endangered Ecological Community under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.|$|E

50|$|The {{basket of}} Gwyddno Garanhir {{is one of}} the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain. According to tradition, Gwyddno was the lord of Cantre'r Gwaelod (The Lowland Hundred) in what is now Cardigan Bay. His chief {{fortress}} was said to have been Caer Wyddno (the Fort of Gwyddno), located somewhere to the north-west of modern-day Aberystwyth. The whole kingdom was protected from the sea by floodgates, which had to be shut before high tide. One day the keeper of the floodgates, Seithenyn, was drunk and failed to close them, with the result that the <b>sea</b> <b>rushed</b> in and covered the land.|$|R
60|$|A man was hoisted {{over the}} gunwale as he spoke, {{and the boat}} passed onward. Just then a round shot {{from one of the}} more distant ships of the fleet--whether English or French they could not tell--struck the water a few yards from them, sending a column of spray high into the air. Instead of sinking, the shot ricochetted from the water and carried away the bow of the boat in passing, {{whirling}} it round and almost overturning it. At the same moment the <b>sea</b> <b>rushed</b> in and swamped it, leaving the crew in the water.|$|R
60|$|Land and sea breezes are {{the next}} species of wind {{to which we}} would direct attention. They occur in {{tropical}} countries, and owe their existence {{to the fact that}} the land is much more easily affected by sudden changes of temperature than the sea. Thus, the land in warm regions is much heated by the sun's rays during the day; the atmosphere over it becomes also heated, in virtue of which it rises: the cool atmosphere over the <b>sea</b> <b>rushes</b> in to supply its place, and forms the sea breeze: which occurs only during the day.|$|R
