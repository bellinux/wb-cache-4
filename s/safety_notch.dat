25|$|The Single Action Army {{action is}} a {{refinement}} of the earlier Colt percussion revolvers and the Colt 1871 cartridge revolver. The cylinder is mounted on a central axis and operated by a hand with a double finger whose more extended action allowed the cylinder-ratchet to be cut in a larger circle, giving more torsional force to the cylinder. Three notches {{on the face of}} the hammer engage the sear portion of the trigger, affording four basic hammer positions. The hammer when fully lowered rests within the frame. Drawn slightly to the rear, the hammer engages the <b>safety</b> <b>notch</b> of the sear and holds the firing pin out of direct contact with a chambered cartridge. Like the earlier percussion revolvers, the Single Action Army was designed to allow loading of all of the chambers. The <b>safety</b> <b>notch</b> replaced pins on the rear of the percussion revolver cylinders, which served the same purpose as the safety position, by preventing hammer contact with the primer/percussion cap. However, many users adopted the practice of leaving one empty chamber under the hammer, because a sharp blow could damage the mechanism and allow a fully loaded revolver to fire. This practice is now universally recommended. Drawn back about half way, the hammer engages the second notch. This cams the cylinder bolt out of engagement and allows the cylinder to rotate for loading. Fully cocked, the revolver is ready to fire. Cartridge ejection is via the spring-loaded rod housed in a tube on the right side of the barrel.|$|E
2500|$|The mini-revolvers {{produced}} by the company are five-shot, single action revolvers, which have a spur trigger design. [...] They are reminiscent of late 19th century pocket revolvers, the main differences being their size and also that NAA's mini-revolvers are made completely of stainless steel. The design of the mini-revolvers was developed by Freedom Arms, which stopped selling these mini-revolvers in 1990 and then sold the design to North American Arms. [...] Since then, North American Arms has further evolved the design, switching to a safety cylinder design, featuring notches machined halfway between the chambers. As a result, the revolver may be safely carried with all five chambers loaded by resting the hammer in a <b>safety</b> <b>notch.</b> [...] Older NAA mini-revolvers can be retrofitted with this safety cylinder design upgrade {{at no cost to}} the owner simply by returning an older design NAA mini-revolver to North American Arms for an upgrade.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Blackhawk, the Old Army did {{not make}} use of Ruger's {{transfer}} bar safety; instead the revolver relied upon a series of <b>safety</b> <b>notches</b> between each chamber on the cylinder like some models of the remington/colt or other black powder revolvers of the mid-19th century had.|$|R
5000|$|However, some single-action revolvers have relief cuts {{in between}} {{cylinder}} bores {{that allow the}} hammer to be rested directly upon the cylinder with no chance of interacting with loaded cartridges or primers. These are also known colloquially as [...] "safety notches." [...] They are usually found on black-powder revolvers, {{but there are also}} cartridge-firing revolvers with <b>safety</b> <b>notches.</b>|$|R
50|$|The trigger {{mechanism}} of the APS is of a simple construction and features a double/single-action fire mode. It comprises a trigger and trigger bar, disconnector, sear and hammer. The rebounding hammer, when in resting state, has an intermediate <b>safety</b> intercept <b>notch</b> that does not allow forward travel of the hammer unless the sear is raised. Disconnection is achieved through a cam in the slide.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>safety</b> <b>notch</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} forms of drop safety, used on older single-action revolvers {{manufactured}} before the invention of the hammer block, some lever-action rifles, 1911-pattern guns, and hammer-fired semi-automatics that were designed before the invention of the firing pin block. The <b>safety</b> <b>notch</b> is a relief cut made in the tumbler at the base of the hammer, that allows the sear to catch and hold the hammer a short distance from the pin or cartridge primer, in a [...] "half-cocked" [...] position. The <b>safety</b> <b>notch</b> works first by allowing the handler to retract the hammer a short distance from the firing pin or primer, such that dropping the firearm on its hammer will not result in an energy transfer to the pin or spur, which could then discharge a chambered cartridge. A second purpose is to allow the sear to [...] "catch" [...] a hammer that is falling when the trigger has not been pulled, such as in cases where a drop jarred the sear loose or when the hammer was not fully cocked before being released. However, a <b>safety</b> <b>notch</b> used to [...] "half-cock" [...] a firearm is an active feature that must be engaged, and does not positively prevent accidental discharges in all cases. A certain amount of manual dexterity and familiarity with a firearm is also required to [...] "half-cock" [...] a firearm; unfamiliarity with how to engage the [...] "half-cock" [...] position can result in accidental discharges. Moreover, <b>safety</b> <b>notch</b> and [...] "half-cock" [...] style safeties are prone to breakage which can result in unintentional discharges leading to severe personal injuries or death.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} SIG Pro {{does not}} have a manual safety but it does incorporate a decocking lever (lowers the hammer without striking the firing pin), trigger-bar disconnect (disconnects the trigger when the slide is out of battery), automatic firing pin lock (does not free the firing pin until the trigger is depressed) and a hammer <b>safety</b> intercept <b>notch</b> (prevents the hammer from striking the rear of the firing pin until the trigger is depressed).|$|R

5000|$|Type D is a double-action-only (DAO) pistol. The hammer {{follows the}} slide to the uncocked {{position}} with every shot, requiring a double-action trigger pull for each shot. There is no manual <b>safety,</b> half-cock hammer <b>notch,</b> or hammer drop lever. The Type D is a self-loading pistol that operates like a [...] "hammerless" [...] double-action revolver. The Type D has an exposed hammer but it cannot be manually cocked.|$|R
50|$|It is {{fitted with}} a frame-mounted, thumb-operated rear-locking safety, which also blocks the slide. This can be applied with the hammer fully down, or cocked. The hammer has a half-cock <b>safety</b> <b>notch.</b> There is an inertia type firing pin design:.|$|E

5000|$|Type F is a double/single-action (DA/SA) pistol with {{a manual}} safety that {{also serves as}} a hammer {{decocking}} lever. It operates {{in the same way as}} the Beretta 92F (M9) service pistol. Pushing the slide mounted safety lever down returns the hammer to its [...] "down" [...] position and also disconnects the trigger so that the pistol cannot be fired until the safety lever is pushed up into the [...] "fire" [...] position. There is also a half-cock <b>safety</b> <b>notch.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Rifles {{come with}} various safeties. Some use a cross-bolt safety button, others a wing safety at the rear, {{or even a}} [...] "half-cock" [...] notch (such as found on older lever-action rifles.) The Winchester Model 94 {{originally}} utilized a [...] "half-cock" [...] <b>notch</b> <b>safety</b> but the design was revised in 1983 due to numerous inadvertent discharges. The M1 Garand created a safety with a metal rocking lever {{at the front of}} the trigger guard that is now called the Garand-style safety, used in the Ruger Mini-14 rifle and Marlin Camp Carbine.|$|R
5000|$|The P22's slide mounted safety, when engaged, {{performs}} two functions. First, {{it serves}} as a [...] "hammer block" [...] by rotating a portion of the metal surface of the safety into a position that interferes with the hammer's contact with the firing pin. Second, it acts as a [...] "firing pin lock" [...] by rotating a portion of the <b>safety</b> into a <b>notch</b> {{on the underside of the}} firing pin, thereby inhibiting forward movement. The P22 safety does not prevent sear or trigger movement, and (as noted), it does not provide a hammer-drop function. If the hammer is cocked when a P22 has been placed on [...] "safe," [...] the hammer will continue to remain cocked and will fall only if the trigger is pressed. If the safety is on, the hammer will strike the safety instead of the firing pin and, therefore, fail to fire.|$|R
50|$|Despite these changes, U.S. Repeating Arms did not flourish, declaring {{bankruptcy}} in 1989. It was subsequently purchased by Belgian arms maker FN Herstal, which set about improving the whole Winchester line, instituting modern CNC methods of production at Winchester's factory while also seeking {{to expand the}} sales and marketing of Winchester rifles worldwide. This effort would culminate in two major changes to the gun in 1992: the reintroducing of now-CNC-machined parts and solid pins back into the action, {{and the elimination of}} the traditional half-cock <b>safety</b> <b>notch</b> on the hammer in favor of a cross-bolt safety, which enabled the gun to be sold internationally.|$|E

50|$|The Browning Hi-Power BDA is a {{semi-automatic}} short recoil operated locked breech firearm. It has a vertically tilting delayed camming action. This {{locking mechanism}} was {{borrowed from the}} Browning Hi-Power. The handgun features a double-action trigger which cocks and then releases the hammer. The recoil of the slide recocks the hammer, and all consecutive shots are fired from the single-action mode. A disconnector ensures the pistol fires in semi-automatic mode only. The spring-loaded external claw extractor is mounted in the slide, while the fixed ejector - inside the pistol’s frame. The BDA is secured against unintentional firing with an automatic firing pin safety which blocks the firing pin and is released only when the trigger is pulled to fire. Immediately after a round is fired, the safety reengages itself even if the trigger is not released. The BDA also has a decocking safety that safely releases and captures the hammer in a <b>safety</b> <b>notch.</b> A decocking lever is mounted {{on each side of}} the pistol’s frame.|$|E
