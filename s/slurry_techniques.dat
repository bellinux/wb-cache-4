40|$|Over {{the last}} years {{pharmaceutical}} cocrystals have been driving much interest from both academic and industrial environments because their physical and pharmacokinetic properties (e. g. solubility, stability) can be different and improved as compared {{to those of the}} corresponding pure APIs. Crystal engineering proved to be a powerful tool to design pharmaceutical cocrystals of APIs by evaluating the robustness of the potential intermolecular interactions between the cocrystal components, thus offering an alternative solution to polymorphs, salts, solvates/hydrates and amorphous solids[1, 2]. Pharmaceutical cocrystals can be prepared by several (classical) methods such as mechanochemical (e. g., neat and liquid-assisted grinding) or traditional solution crystallization approaches (e. g., solvent evaporation techniques and <b>slurry</b> <b>techniques).</b> However, using these techniques, cocrystals may become electrostatically charged (as may result from the stress applied in classical grinding methods) or suffer undesired interactions with organic solvents (when using classical evaporation or slurries-forming techniques) that may be incorporated into the crystal lattice with the possibility of solvate formation. Because of the disadvantages presented by these classical cocrysta...|$|E

These coatings were applied in two steps. A modifier alloy was applied by <b>slurry</b> <b>techniques</b> and was sintered in vacuum prior to siliciding by pack cementation in argon. Application of the modifier alloy by pack cementation {{was found to be}} much less effective. The addition of titanium and vanadium to molybdenum and tungsten yielded beneficial modifier alloys, whereas the addition of chromium showed no improvement. After siliciding, the 15 Ti- 35 W- 15 V- 35 Mo modifier alloy exhibited the best performance; one sample survived 1064 hours of oxidation at 2400 F. This same coating was the only coating to reproducibly provide 600 hours of protection at both 1600 and 2400 F; {{in the second and third}} of three experiments, involving oxidation of three to five specimens at each temperature in each experiment, no failures were observed in 600 hours of testing.

40|$|In estuarine sediments with a {{high degree}} of {{vertical}} heterogeneity in reduced substrate and terminal electron acceptor concentrations, the method of exposure of the microbiota to labeled substrates can introduce a "disturbance artifact" into measures of metabolic activity. The detection of this artifact is based on quantitative measurement of the relative rates of incorporation of [14 C]acetate into phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) and endogenous storage lipid, poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoate (PHA). Previous studies have shown that PLFA synthesis measures cellular growth and that PHA synthesis measures carbon accumulation (unbalanced growth). The "disturbance artifact" of exposure to [14 C]acetate was demonstrated by comparing injection of a core with the usual or pore-water replacement or <b>slurry</b> <b>techniques.</b> Only injection of labeled substrate allowed detection of preassay disturbance of the sediment with a garden rake. The raking increased PLFA synthesis with little effect to differences in concentration or distribution of [14 C]acetate in the 10 -min incubation. Bioturbation induced by sand dollar feeding in estuarine sediment could be detected in an increased PLFA/PHA ratio which was due to decreased PHA synthesis if the addition of labeled substrate was by the injection technique. Addition of labeled precursors to sediment by slurry or pore-water replacement induces greater disturbance artifacts than injection techniques...|$|E

In this study plain and Si-modified aluminide coatings were applied by <b>slurry</b> <b>technique</b> on internal surfaces of Ni-base GTD- 111 superalloy cylindrical specimens derived from a gas turbine air-cooled blade.

The present work focuses on the sintering effects on the properties of titanium foam prepared using the <b>slurry</b> <b>technique.</b> Sintering affects the density as well as the mechanical properties of the sintered parts. To achieve a high density of the titanium alloy foam, the effects of various parameters including temperature, time profile and composition have to be characterized and optimized.
