5|$|Focused only several {{kilometres}} {{below the}} surface, the earthquake resulted in significant <b>shaking</b> {{over a large}} portion of central-eastern South Island. Maximum ground motions registered at VIII (severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale in Christchurch, while strong <b>shaking</b> (MM VI) was felt in adjacent populated areas such as Rolleston and Lincoln. The landforms of Sumner recorded intensified <b>shaking</b> due to the effects of its topographic setting. Widespread lighter motions were observed throughout much of the remaining region, with slight property damage reported from as far afield as Dunedin. The earthquake was felt as far away as New Plymouth and Invercargill.|$|E
5|$|The Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) website, {{one of the}} top global {{earthquake}} information website {{experienced a}} massive and immediate traffic surge caused by the convergence of eyewitnesses looking for information about the <b>shaking.</b> Their hit times proved to mimic the seismic wave propagation generated by the earthquake. On average eyewitnesses hit the website 90s after the ground start <b>shaking.</b> The epicenter was determined with 30km by retropagating 2 min of EMSC website traffic without using any seismic data. The authors argue that eyewitnesses can be considered as real time sensor, their website visit being triggerred by the ground <b>shaking.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} produced <b>shaking</b> at Pangandaran (where the M6.3 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake {{was felt}} more strongly) of intensity III–IV (Weak–Light), intensity III at Cianjur, and II (Weak) at Yogyakarta. Further inland and {{farther from the}} epicenter, intensity IV <b>shaking</b> made tall buildings sway in Jakarta, but at some coastal villages {{where many of the}} casualties occurred, the <b>shaking</b> was not felt as strong. An informal survey of 67 people that were present at the time revealed that in at least eight cases, individuals stated that they did not feel the earthquake at all (a typical M7.7 earthquake would have been distinctly noticed at those distances). The unusually low felt intensities, along with the short period body wave magnitudes, were components of the event that narrowed its classification into that of a tsunami earthquake.|$|E

5|$|Scientists have {{estimated}} {{that there have been}} at least 13significant earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone in the last 6,000years. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant <b>shaking</b> associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides. <b>Shaking</b> due to this earthquake made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened. The tsunami created by the earthquake ultimately devastated a winter village at Pachena Bay, killing all the people that lived there. The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused near-shore subsidence, submerging marshes and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{also had}} {{significant}} political repercussions, <b>shaking</b> the British Army's confidence.

5|$|The {{earthquake}} hit at 13:52:19 IRST, or 1:52 pm (10:22:19 UTC), {{and lasted}} between 10 and 30seconds. It killed 13people and injured 100 on Qeshm Island. In Zirang (Ziranag), a village on Qeshm, 80percent {{of the buildings}} were demolished. Seven villages experienced extensive damage, and 13 villages were destroyed: Tonban, Ramekan, Gevarzin, Khaledin, Direstan, Kushe, Karavan, Turyan, Tom senati, Gorbehdan, Ziranag, Giahdan, and Gourian. There were reports of intensity III effects on the Mercalli scale from Bandar Abbas, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah and Ras al-Khaimah; Intensity IV (Light) effects occurred at Sharjah. <b>Shaking</b> from the earthquake was also noted in Oman. No major damage occurred directly at the epicenter; residents of Qeshm reported that the <b>shaking</b> smashed windows, leading citizens to evacuate their homes fearing collapse. In total more than 2,000 people were affected.|$|E
