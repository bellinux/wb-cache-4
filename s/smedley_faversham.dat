2500|$|In {{the short}} story [...] "Schrödinger's Cat-Sitter" [...] by F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre (published in Analog magazine, July/August 2001), a time-traveler named <b>Smedley</b> <b>Faversham</b> visits the past to {{interview}} Erwin Schrödinger but gets tricked into taking care of Schrödinger's wife's cat while she is away and Schrödinger is visiting Max Planck. In attempting {{to take care of}} the cat, Faversham inadvertently locks it in a cabinet with a Geiger counter, a vial of acid, and a hammer, unintentionally enacting Schrödinger's thought experiment, but with results that remain as uncertain as in the original case.|$|E

Gwynplaine MacIntyre wrote {{a series}} of stories — {{beginning}} with [...] "Time Lines" [...] (published in Analog, 1999) — about a time-traveling criminal named <b>Smedley</b> <b>Faversham,</b> who constantly runs afoul of a scientific principle called [...] "Bester's Law". This term is MacIntyre's invention, but it is explicitly in homage to Alfred Bester's work: specifically, to Bester's 1958 story [...] "The Men Who Murdered Mohammed". Bester's Law, as articulated by MacIntyre, states that a time-traveler who attempts to rewrite the past can only alter {{his or her own}} time-line, not anyone else's. Bester's Law is rigidly enforced by a legion of [...] "time cops", whom MacIntyre's protagonist sneeringly refers to as [...] "the Bester Boosters" [...] and [...] "the Bester-Busters".|$|E
