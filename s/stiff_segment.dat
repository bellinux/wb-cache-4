40|$|When {{simulating}} {{the propagation}} of a pressure pulse in arteries, the discretization parameters (i. e. the time step size and the grid size) need to be chosen carefully {{in order to avoid}} a decrease in amplitude of the traveling wave due to numerical dissipation. In this paper the effect of numerical dissipation is examined using a numerical fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model of the pulse propagation in an artery. More insight in the influence of the temporal and spatial resolution of the wave on the results of these simulations is gained using an analytical study in which the scalar linear one-dimensional transport equation is considered. Although this model {{does not take into account}} the full complexity of the problem under consideration, the results can be used as a guidance for the selection of the numerical parameters. Furthermore, this analysis illustrates the difference in accuracy that can be obtained using a second-order implicit time integration scheme instead of a first-order scheme. The results from the analytical and numerical studies are subsequently used to determine the settings necessary to obtain a grid and time step converged simulation of the wave propagation and reflection in a simplified model of an aorta with repaired aortic coarctation. This FSI model allows to study the hemodynamic impact of a <b>stiff</b> <b>segment</b> and demonstrates that the presence of a <b>stiff</b> <b>segment</b> has an important impact on a short pressure pulse, but has almost no influence on a physiological pressure pulse. This phenomenon is explained by analyzing the reflections induced by the <b>stiff</b> <b>segment...</b>|$|E
30|$|Traditional open {{operations}} on the spine do {{lead to a}} legacy of soft tissue damage, particularly from stripping the posterior paraspinal muscles away from the spine (MacNab et al. 1977). A fusion adds an additional mechanical insult by creating a permanent <b>stiff</b> <b>segment</b> with stress transfer to other levels. If no fusion is carried out, then damage to those paraspinal muscles results in functional loss as those muscle groups are required to support and move those segments (MacNab et al. 1977; Choll 2010). Many surgeons try to limit the soft tissue damage caused by restricting the number of segments spanned by any construct to one level {{above and below the}} fractured vertebra. Short segment fixations such as these from the posterior aspect alone have a significant incidence of loss of correction and metalwork failure (Xiang-Wang et al. 2008; Alanay et al. 2001; Tezeren and Kuru 2005). Anterior procedures provide greater structural support to short segment posterior constructs such as these, but carry a significant complication risk and morbidity (Kim et al. 2009). Anterior procedures for thoracolumbar fractures also means taking down the diaphragm and violating the chest, which is best avoided if possible, particularly if patients have concomitant chest trauma. Stabilising the spine in these patients however has marked benefits for the recovery from associated trauma to other organs (Bellabarba et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|Background: The reservoir-wave {{paradigm}} considers aortic {{pressure as}} the superposition of a 'reservoir pressure', {{directly related to}} changes in reservoir volume, and an 'excess' component ascribed to wave dynamics. The change in reservoir pressure {{is assumed to be}} proportional to the difference between aortic inflow and outflow (i. e. aortic volume changes), an assumption that is virtually impossible to validate in vivo. The aim of this study is therefore to apply the reservoir-wave paradigm to aortic pressure and flow waves obtained from three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction simulations in a model of a normal aorta, aortic coarctation (narrowed descending aorta) and stented coarctation (<b>stiff</b> <b>segment</b> in descending aorta). Method and results: We found no unequivocal relation between the intraaortic volume and the reservoir pressure for any of the simulated cases. When plotted in a pressure-volume diagram, hysteresis loops are found that are looped in a clockwise way indicating that the reservoir pressure is lower than the pressure associated with the change in volume. The reservoir-wave analysis leads to very high excess pressures, especially for the coarctation models, but to surprisingly little changes of the reservoir component despite the impediment of the buffer capacity of the aorta. Conclusion: With the observation that reservoir pressure is not related to the volume in the aortic reservoir in systole, an intrinsic assumption in the wave-reservoir concept is invalidated and, consequently, also the assumption that the excess pressure is the component of pressure that can be attributed to wave travel and reflection...|$|E
40|$|Myofibril elasticity, {{critical}} to muscle function, is {{dictated by the}} intrasarcomeric filament titin, which acts as a molecular spring. To date, the molecular events underlying {{the mechanics of the}} folded titin chain remain largely unknown. We have elucidated the crystal structure of the 6 -Ig fragment I 65 -I 70 from the elastic I-band fraction of titin and validated its conformation in solution using small angle x-ray scattering. The long-range properties of the chain have been visualized by electron microscopy on a 19 -Ig fragment and modeled for the full skeletal tandem. Results show that conserved Ig-Ig transition motifs generate high-order {{in the structure of the}} filament, where conformationally <b>stiff</b> <b>segments</b> interspersed with pliant hinges form a regular pattern of dynamic super-motifs leading to segmental flexibility in the chain. Pliant hinges support molecular shape rearrangements that dominate chain behavior at moderate stretch, whereas <b>stiffer</b> <b>segments</b> predictably oppose high stretch forces upon full chain extension. There, librational entropy can be expected to act as an energy barrier to prevent Ig unfolding while, instead, triggering the unraveling of flanking springs formed by proline, glutamate, valine, and lysine (PEVK) sequences.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Coil {{embolization}} {{for very}} small aneurysms (< 3 mm in maximum diameter) {{has been considered}} a technically challenging method due to increased risk of potential aneurysm perforation during the procedure. We present our observations about the structural limitations of eight types of microcatheters and three types of detachable coils, and technical pitfalls in the coiling of very small aneurysms. METHODS: The structures of each type of microcatheter and coil were carefully evaluated under a stereoscopic microscope. The evaluation the microcatheters {{was focused on the}} distance between the distal end of the distal marker and the tip of microcatheter. The evaluation of the coils was focused on the length of the detachment zone. RESULTS: With markers of the coil delivery systems and microcatheters aligned under fluoroscopic visualization according to the manufacturers' recommendations, the stiff detachment zones protruded approximately 0. 2 - 1 mm from the microcatheter tip. The lengths of the detachment zone, which is known to be a <b>stiff</b> <b>segment,</b> of the currently available coils were approximately 0. 5 - 0. 8 mm. The distance between the distal end of the distal markers of the microcatheters and the detachment zone of the coil ranged from approximately 1. 2 to 2. 8 mm. CONCLUSION: To prevent rupture of very small aneurysms during coiling, the distal marker of the selected microcatheter should be carefully located near the aneurysm neck, considering all the structural characteristic of the currently available coils and microcatheters. Refinement of currently available devices may be essential to achieve safer coiling of very small aneurysms...|$|E
40|$|Using {{molecular}} dynamics simulation, we investigate {{the effect of}} confinement on a system that comprises several <b>stiff</b> <b>segmented</b> polymer chains where each chain has similar segments, but length and stiffness of the segments vary among the chains which makes the system inhomogeneous. The translational and orientational entropy loss due to the confinement {{plays a crucial role}} in organizing the chains which can be considered as an entropy-driven segregation mechanism to differentiate the components of the system. Due to the inhomogeneity, both weak and strong confinement regimes show the competition in the system and we see segregation of chains as the confining volume is decreased. In the case of strong spherical confinement, a chain at the periphery shows higher angular mobility than other chains, despite being more radially constrained. Comment: 16 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

In einem selektiven Lösungsmittel, in dem sich nur die Ketten lösen, bildet ein Rod-Coil Multiblock zylinderförmige Micellen aus aggregierten Stäbchen verbunden durch Kettenstücke. Die Stäbchen aggregieren, um Energie zu gewinnen. Dieser Prozeß wird durch den Entropieverlust der flexiblen Ketten ausgeglichen. Das Adsorptionsverhalten von Aggregaten aus {{parallel}} aneinandergelagerten, einzelnen Rod-Coil Diblöcken in selektivem Lösungsmittel wird anhand von erweiterten Skalenbetrachtungen diskutiert. Wenn ein solches Aggregat mit den Stäbchen parallel zur Oberfläche adsorbiert, verschieben sich die Stäbchen gegeneinander. Zusätzlich werden die Stabilität der adsorbierten Aggregate und andere mögliche Konfigurationen untersucht. Um einen Rod-Coil Multiblock mit variabler Zusammensetzung zu studieren, wird eine Feldtheorie entwickelt. Jedes Segment kann entweder steif oder flexibel sein. Das System zeigt drei Phasenzustände, offene Kette, amorphe Globule und flüssig-kristalline Globule. Beim Übergang von amorpher zu flüssig-kristalliner Globule steigt der Anteil an steifen Segmenten rapide an. Dieser Übergang wird durch die isotrope Wechselwirkung zwischen den steifen Segmenten und die anisotrope Oberflächenenergie der Globule verursacht.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Hydrogels such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (pNI-PAM-AAc) can be photopatterned {{to create}} {{a wide range of}} actuatable and self-folding microstructures. Mechanical motion is derived from the large and {{reversible}} swelling response of this cross-linked hydrogel in varying thermal or pH environments. This action is facilitated by their network structure and capacity for large strain. However, due to the low modulus of such hydrogels, they have limited gripping ability of relevance to surgical excision or robotic tasks such as pick-and-place. Using experiments and modeling, we design, fabricate, and characterize photopatterned, self-folding functional microgrippers that combine a swellable, photo-cross-linked pNIPAM-AAc soft-hydrogel with a nonswellable and <b>stiff</b> <b>segmented</b> polymer (polypropylene fumarate, PPF). We also show that we can embed iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3) nanoparticles into the porous hydrogel layer, allowing the microgrippers to be responsive and remotely guided using magnetic fields. Using finite element models, we investigate the influence of the thickness and the modulus of both the hydrogel and stiff polymer layers on the self-folding characteristics of the microgrippers.

40|$|All {{biological}} macromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, polysaccarids) are polymers. These {{are extremely}} complex systems, with thousands or millions of atomic degrees of freedom. However, {{a range of}} important properties of such systems do {{not depend on the}} detailed atomic structure, but on geometrical structure on a much larger length scale. Rheological properties [1, 2, 3] as well as properties related to rotational diffusion [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] of whole molecules are important examples. This justifies the use of coarse graining models, where exible coils with a continous stiffness distribution [10], chains of beads [1, 11, 2, 12] or chains of <b>stiff</b> <b>segments</b> [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] are used to represent the molecule. While simple compared to a model with detailed descriptions of positions and motions of individual atoms of a molecule, the mathematical complexity of these models is still significant, and only a few special cases can be solved analytically [2]. Numerical simulation techniques are thus important tools in the study of polymer systems [18]. This introduction first presents a general background and motivation for Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of polymer systems (Sections 2 - 3). Then an overview of BD algorithms for the bead-spring and bead-rod polymer models are given (Section 4). While the resulting algorithms presented are equal to those presented in the literature [18, 19], a slightly different path is followed while deriving the algorithms. Finally an overview of the nuggetspring chain and nugget chain models is given (Section 5). Aspects of these algorithms are covered in detail elsewhere in this thesis, but for completeness and comparation with the bead chain models, an overview is given here. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

As a result, for persistence lengths of more than five monomers no length scale can be described by the Rouse model. Comment: 10 pages revtex, 5 figures, partly colo...|$|R

The model is applied to devices with the active polymer consisting of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) and PPV derivatives with <b>stiff</b> conjugated <b>segments</b> having their long axis oriented parallel and perpendicular to the electrode surfaces as well as randomly oriented, which are three of the molecular arrangements that can be obtained experimentally at microscopic scale in solution-processed conjugated polymer thin films. The model provides insight into current efficiency, charge distribution, internal electric field and consequently recombination throughout the polymer layer. We found that the details of molecular arrangement crucially affect the distribution of recombination events far from the electrodes and its field dependence, which has implications for the efficiency of PLEDs. In particular, we found a variation of recombination efficiency in the bulk of uniform ordered polymer films depending on the molecular alignment relative to the electrode surfaces. It turns out that molecular orientation perpendicular to the electrodes increases recombination in the centre of the polymer film as compared to the case of parallel orientation. We conclude that the orientational alignment perpendicular to the electrode surfaces might be a viable strategy towards efficient polymer-based LEDs.

We want to study the impact of the presence of hyperon cores on the radius-mass relation for NS. We aim to find out how, and for which particular stellar mass range, a specific relation R(M), where M is the gravitational mass, and R is the circumferential radius, is associated with the presence of a hyperon core. We consider a set of 14 theoretical EOS of dense matter, based on the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approximation, allowing for the presence of hyperons in NSs.

Background: Chronic total occlusions (CTOs) are the most technically challenging lesion subset that interventional cardiologists might face, and that recanalization of these lesions will have {{the most impact on}} future percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) success. Considering the recent development of catheter based technologies specific for CTO recanalization and the potential of drug-eluting stents, these lesions are now recognized as the last barrier to percutaneous revascularization success. Methods: 30 patients with CTO lesion(s) and evidence of viable myocardium underwent PCI in Kobry Elkobba hospital. We studied the effect of demographic data, angiographic data as lesion length, stump and proximal cap, calcification, angulation, bridging collaterals and distal cap and finally echocardiography pre and 3  months post procedural. Results: Procedural success was obtained in 25 patients (83. 3 %), 19 of them was antegrade and 6 was retrograde. There was no significant effect of different demographic data on the outcome, but angiographic criteria favoring success was tapered proximal cap, short lesions < 15  mm, lesion angle < 45 degree and no origin of side branch at the CTO <b>segment.</b> <b>Stiff</b> wires had the greatest chance to cross the CTO lesions, with the help of microcatheter.

First, rotating leg {{is replaced by a}} oscillate leg to mimic the leg movement pattern in human and other animals; second, muscles are applied to the oscillate leg model as power input; third, multi-segments leg are restored for the oscillate single segment leg model. ^ We first set out to determine how the whole-body dynamics of legged locomotion are affected by whether legs are oscillated or simply rotated around the hip position. We compared the stability of CT-SLIP with leg rotation versus leg retraction and find that there exists no clear general trends regarding the superior stability of one method over the other. For small perturbations the two methods are shown to yield identical stability of whole-body motion. For large perturbations, while particular cases show differences, on the whole it is not clear which method proves more stable in general. ^ We then modified the motor torque function in original model with muscle torques. Unlike the Rhex robot from which CT-SLIP is derived, most animals use skeleton muscle to power their locomotion. We want to determine if this difference on torque function would effect the system dynamics. We found that the muscle damping which is not included in original CT-SLIP would slow down the walking speed of system. Increasing larger damping coefficient would eventually cause the system to fail. Finally we replaced the single segment spring leg in CT-SLIP with a two <b>segments</b> <b>stiff</b> leg.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{in-between}} space {{has been the}} main topic {{over a long period}} of reflection on contemporary architecture and cities, and has produced a significant accumulation of thoughts on the form of contemporary space. The basic premise to the problem of in-between space is the possibility of identifying homogeneous and finite parts, on which the concept of a city of parts may be founded. The concept of in-between space is based on the idea that there is an essentially void and formally non-structured space between solid objects, i. e., an “otherness” between empty space and formed matter. “In-between” is thus defined by negation. The only possible measure of it is, strictly speaking, the distance between its non-edges: this dimension, while reacting with the dimensions and shapes of the boundaries, generates a number of formal features of in-between space. In-between space has been a necessary complement to the finiteness of the parts, which lie on it as shapes on the background; at the same time, it has been the unresolved portion of urban composition, where aporias arise within the urban space of a compact city. It has been described as a non-structured field, fluid and elusive, on the borders of which non-interacting solids rise. At some point, from once being a residual background, in-between space has become resourceful, overwhelming in its potential, differences and diversity: it has been chosen as a favourite culture medium for research on urban public spaces which were presumed to be freed, unforeseen, capable of hosting various and unexpected relationships; it has been acknowledged as both urban space and collective territory. It is unaccomplished, open, malleable space, available for manipulation and transformation. If the formal crystallisation of finite and composed parts fits the principle of Alberti’s concinnitas, and is extremely unlikely to add or subtract anything without undermining the Vitruvian symmetry between the whole and its parts, the incorporeity of in-between space allows it to host any object and to be activated, transformed, "tidied up". Although all this is in fact consistent in the hypothesis of the clear-cut otherness between shaped matter and amorphous immateriality, the solidity of such a Manichean separation begins to break down. The hypothesis of a less clear duality between space and matter – which finds some uncertain similarities in the theory of relativity and in quantum physics – together with the hypothesis of the increasing liquidity of contemporariness presents us with new models of architectural and urban space, in which the fundamental requisites of the idea of in-between space are invalidated. The loss of finiteness of architectural objects and their shapes and the chaotic sprawl of built matter, all mean that it is increasingly difficult to fit the parts within the whole; the solid parts appear less as lithospheric plates surrounded by stagnant waters, and more as rafts floating on fluid, slowly drifting masses. The idea of the city of parts is replaced by that of the city of layers, and the dual paradigm of figure and background is replaced by a model composed of borderless, extensive layers, which overlap, intersect, fuse and react with each other. Tidy built matter appears as a temporary concretion, a state of excitation of an extensive space-time continuum which is revealed when it is [de-]formed by differences of density and energy. The idea of the otherness between space and matter, as well as that of an interaction in the distance between massive bodies through in-between space, is replaced by a vision moulded according to the physical concept of the field which permeates anything and can be bent, folded, thickened or thinned; be elastically or plastically weak, revealing its softness; it may harden into <b>stiff</b> <b>segments,</b> solidify or liquefy, and yet keep its consistency. The urban space between objects becomes a blurred mixture across things and implies a shift from a paratactic composition, in which discrete distances between finite parts may be measured, towards a composition of layers, which works on the space of sprawling, overlapping and intersecting entities, accommodating many unexpected relationships. Besides eroding and breaking the boundaries of in-between space in order to extend it greatly, such a model amplifies the system of possible formal and functional relationships and multiplies the number of scalar ratios within the field; it defines a complex structure, which is, par excellence, able to generate collective space for contemporary society. As a forma urbis parallel text to this vision, we briefly describe here a project ongoing at the Research Laboratory on Architectural Design, Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, University of Padova, designing scenarios for transforming an area of Padova which is emblematic of the condition of in-between space today. The area of our case study covers about 300 hectares north-east of the city centre of Padova. Its northern boundary is flanked by the Padova-Venice railway line, and the whole area already contains several expressways, complex junctions and roundabouts, as well as industrial districts, shopping malls and residential urban fabric. According to our hypothesis, planned transformations include: a new city hospital for Padova and a university campus for medical studies and research, implementation of infrastructures to improve accessibility with new facilities such as parking lots, intermodal hubs, a local railway stations, densification of residential fabrics, recycling of former industrial districts, and an urban park with sports, leisure and healthcare facilities. This large-scale project will work on urban and landscape areas, overlapping and intersecting at several layers on differing scales, such as green areas, water networks, infrastructural paths with urban forms and irregular fragments and textures, which [de-]form open ground to create scenarios of public space for today's city...|$|R
40|$|Although data {{exist that}} address the attempt to {{correlate}} noninvasive Doppler-derived pressure gradients with invasive catheter pressure gradients in patients with coarctation of the aorta, few data exist about stiffness of the proximal descending aorta (precoarctation) {{and its relation to}} these pressure measurements. In this study, an in vitro flow model of a simulated neonatal aorta with a coarctation was developed. Three proximal descending aortas of different stiffnesses were used. The stiffness index of the proximal descending aorta was calculated as β = ln [systolic pressure/diastolic pressure/(systolic diameter – diastolic diameter) ]. We evaluated pressure gradients obtained by continuous wave Doppler and standard catheter methods and looked at acceleration of flow velocity determined by pulsed wave Doppler in the 3 precoarctation segments of differing stiffnesses. Pressures in the proximal descending aorta (precoarctation) increased with increasing stiffness, ranging from 105 mm Hg (soft) to greater than 300 mm Hg (stiff). Continuous wave Doppler instantaneous pressure gradients overestimated the catheter instantaneous pressure gradients substantially (mean 41 % ± 19 %). The <b>stiffer</b> the precoarctation <b>segment,</b> the more the degree of overestimation: soft, 0 % to 63 % (= 3. 47); medium, 13 % to 54 % (β = 4. 42); and stiff, 43 % to 66 % (β = 5. 91). Inclusion of the precoarctation velocity [V 1] component in the Bernoulli equation did not significantly improve the correlation or the agreement. An additional observation was that pullback catheter peak-to-peak gradients were higher than simultaneous peak-to-peak gradients. In the stiff aorta, this difference could be greater than 22 mm Hg (> 19 %). Acceleration of flow velocity toward the coarctation was evident by pulsed wave Doppler interrogation. Increasing the stiffness of the precoarctation segment also increased the degree of acceleration within this proximal segment: soft, 0. 4 to 0. 8 m/s; medium, 0. 5 to 1. 4 m/s; and stiff, 0. 7 to 1. 5 m/s. These data suggest that increasing stiffness of the proximal descending aorta can alter the continuous wave detected Doppler gradient and although the gradient itself has increased, it may not predict accurately the true severity of the localized, most severely obstructed segment...|$|R
40|$|Sound-evoked {{vibrations}} transmitted {{into the}} mammalian cochlea produce traveling waves {{that provide the}} mechanical tuning necessary for spectral decomposition of sound. These traveling waves of motion propagate along the basilar membrane (BM) and ultimately stimulate the mechano-sensory receptors. The tectorial membrane (TM) {{plays a key role}} in this stimulation process, but its mechanical function remains unclear. Here we show that the TM supports traveling waves that are an intrinsic feature of its visco-elastic structure. Radial forces applied at audio frequencies (1 - 20 kHz) to isolated TM segments generate longitudinally propagating waves on the TM with velocities similar to those of the BM traveling wave near its best frequency (BF) place. We compute the dynamic shear storage modulus and shear viscosity of the TM from the propagation velocity of the waves and show that segments of the TM from the basal turn are <b>stiffer</b> than apical <b>segments</b> are. Analysis of loading effects of hair bundle stiffness, the limbal attachment of the TM, and viscous damping in the subtectorial space suggests that TM traveling waves can occur in vivo. To test how TM waves may participate in cochlear function, we investigated waves in genetically modified mice lacking beta-tectorin, a glycoprotein found exclusively in the TM. Tectb-/- mutant mice were previously shown to exhibit significant loss of cochlear sensitivity at low frequencies and sharpened frequency tuning compared to wild types. We show that the spatial extent and propagation velocity of TM traveling waves are significantly reduced in Tectb-/- mice compared to wild types, consistent with the concept that there is a reduction in the spread of excitation via TM waves and less TM wave interaction with the BM traveling wave in Tectb-/- mice. (cont.) The differences in TM wave properties between mutants and wild types arise from changes to the mechanical properties of the TM; mutant TMs are significantly less stiff than wild type TMs are. Our results show the presence of a traveling wave mechanism through the TM that can functionally couple a significant longitudinal extent of the cochlea and may interact with the BM wave, suggesting that TM waves are crucial for cochlear sensitivity and tuning. by Roozbeh Ghaffari.
