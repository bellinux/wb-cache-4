40|$|Robust text-to-speech (TTS) systems {{require a}} letter-to-pronunciation module for {{generating}} the pronunciations of words {{missing from the}} system lexicon. These pronunciations must specify not only the phone sequence that corresponds to an input orthography, but also the location of lexical stress. However, letter-to-pronunciation modules that make use of a window of context letters around a target letter normally cannot “see ” larger-context morphological information that is highly correlated with stress location. The present work demonstrates that by adding a new component that uses morphological information to predict which letter of a word might receive primary stress, and then using the resulting “stressed letters ” as input to a decision tree stressed-letter-to-pronunciation component, improvements to both stress accuracy and phone accuracy are obtained in American English, British English, and German. Furthermore, using <b>stressed</b> <b>letters</b> as the input to the decision tree also improves phone accuracy when stress is not required in the output pronunciation, as is conventionally the case for automatic speech recognition (ASR). 1...|$|E

As in the case of lithium insertion in phase-separating LiFePO 4 nanoparticles, the theory predicts a transition from complex to uniform morphologies of Li 2 O 2 with increasing current. Discrete particle growth at low discharge rates becomes suppressed at high rates, resulting in a film of electronically insulating Li 2 O 2 that limits cell performance. We predict that the transition between these surface growth modes occurs at current densities close to the exchange current density of the cathode reaction, consistent with experimental observations.

The mark 3 without the letter added, is for words, stressed in the next-to-last syllable. The letter after is for polysyllabic words and says what type of stress the syllable has in those cases where the stress falls on the stem (other cases receive it on the ending) and how distant from the ending the syllable <b>stressed</b> is. The <b>letter</b> a is for a start-firm (tvirtapradė priegaidė) accent and the letter b – for an end-firm (tvirtagalė priegaidė) and short stressed vowel. The single digit with a letter means that the stress falls on the third syllable from the ending; if the stress falls on the fourth syllable from the ending, the mark is 34a or 34b, there are also nouns having stress in the fifth (35a, 35b) and sixth (36b) syllable from the ending.
