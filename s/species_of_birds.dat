5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> and five species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> and 30 and 55 species of mammals.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle {{distinguished}} about 500 <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds,</b> {{mammals and}} fishes in History of Animals and Parts of Animals.

Aristotle distinguished animals with blood, Enhaima (the modern zoologist's vertebrates) and animals without blood, Anhaima (invertebrates).|$|E
5|$|Distraction {{displays}} {{attract the}} attention of predators away from an object, typically the nest or young, that is being protected. Distraction displays are performed by some <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds,</b> which may feign a broken wing while hopping about on the ground, and by some species of fish.|$|E
