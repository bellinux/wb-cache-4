5|$|Bertie {{remained}} unconvinced {{about his}} <b>suitability</b> as king but Lionel encouraged Bertie {{to express his}} voice by disrespecting King Edward's Chair and the Stone of Scone. Lionel rehearsed Bertie and the coronation ceremony is completed.|$|E
5|$|In Michigan, whose Old Mission Peninsula and Leelanau Peninsula AVAs (near Traverse City) {{are known}} for their ice wine, Riesling is a fairly common variety, in part on account of its <b>suitability</b> for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|A {{hardy and}} {{versatile}} garden plant, B.integrifolia is widely planted in Australian gardens. It {{is a popular}} choice for parks and streetscapes, and {{has been used for}} bush revegetation and stabilisation of dunes. Its hardiness has prompted research into its <b>suitability</b> for use as a rootstock in the cut flower trade, but has also caused concerns about its potential to become a weed outside its natural habitat.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Noel Wild was Dudley Clarke's deputy in Cairo from April 1942. Toward {{the end of}} 1943, when Ops (B) was {{scheduled}} for expansion to assist with Bodyguard, a deception cover plan for the D-Day landings, Clarke secretly suggested Wild as the department's head. In December of that year Wild was sent to London, he believed on leave, where he was assessed for <b>suitability</b> and then appointed to the role.|$|E
5|$|Funding for a naval {{version was}} not provided; the Marine Corps {{continued}} to use the AH-1. The Canadian Forces Maritime Command also examined a naval Apache. In 2004, British Army AgustaWestland Apaches were deployed upon the Royal Navy's , a Landing Platform Helicopter, for <b>suitability</b> testing; there was U.S. interest in the trials.|$|E
5|$|Garamond is {{the name}} of a {{character}} in the Wii game Super Paper Mario. He appears in the world of Flopside (the mirror-image of Flipside, where the game begins). He is a prolific and highly successful author, unlike his Flipside counterpart, Helvetica (a probable recognition of the relative <b>suitability</b> of the two fonts for use in book typesetting).|$|E
5|$|Prediction is a rate {{enhancement}} {{strategy in}} which the device attempts to predict the letter, word or phrase being written by the user. The user can then select the correct prediction without needing to write the full word. Word prediction software may determine the words predicted based on their frequency in language, association with other words, past choices of the user, or grammatical <b>suitability.</b>|$|E
5|$|Seidler thought Paul Bettany {{would be}} a good choice to play King GeorgeVI, Tom Hooper {{preferred}} Hugh Grant, though both actors refused the offer. Once they met with Firth and heard him read for the part, Seidler and Hooper were convinced of his <b>suitability</b> for the role.|$|E
5|$|The {{hardness}} of diamond {{contributes to}} its <b>suitability</b> as a gemstone. Because {{it can only}} be scratched by other diamonds, it maintains its polish extremely well. Unlike many other gems, it is well-suited to daily wear because of its resistance to scratching—perhaps contributing to its popularity as the preferred gem in engagement or wedding rings, which are often worn every day.|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may be in order to mate, or they may be influenced by the <b>suitability</b> of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Although {{plans for}} further heavy bomber attacks on Tirpitz were {{developed}} throughout 1942, none took place. One {{of the options}} considered was to stage the bombers through a base in the northern Soviet Union, but this was judged impractical as little was known about the <b>suitability</b> of Soviet airfields for heavy bombers at the time. Two squadrons of RAF Coastal Command Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers operated from Vaenga in northern Russia during mid-September 1942 to counter Tirpitz or any other German warships which attempted to attack Allied convoys, but these aircraft did not {{make contact with the}} enemy.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{numerous}} laws that {{form part of}} kashrut are the prohibitions on the consumption of certain animals (such as pork, shellfish (both Mollusca and Crustacea)) and most insects, {{with the exception of}} certain species of kosher locusts), mixtures of meat and milk, and the commandment to slaughter mammals and birds according to a process known as shechita. There are also laws regarding agricultural produce that might impact the <b>suitability</b> of food for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Development of Dominion of the Dark Djinn {{began in}} 2008. The game's {{animated}} sequences were produced by Studio Ghibli, while the original score was co-composed by Joe Hisaishi. The artwork was also inspired by Studio Ghibli's other productions. The character development of Oliver {{was a large}} focus of the game, intending to make children empathize with the character and for adults to relive their adolescence. The developers chose to develop for the Nintendo DS due to its <b>suitability</b> for gameplay.|$|E
5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the <b>suitability</b> {{of the tower}} {{for the work of}} the {{department}} came into question. The condition of the roof remained problematic, and steel girders had to be added to support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their Bushy House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium, {{commonly}} known as common cottongrass or common cottonsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family Cyperaceae. Native to North America, North Asia, and Northern Europe, it grows on peat or acidic soils, in open wetland, heath or moorland. It begins to flower in April or May and, after fertilisation in early summer, the small, unremarkable brown and green flowers develop distinctive white bristle-like seed-heads that resemble tufts of cotton; combined with its ecological <b>suitability</b> to bog, these characteristics give rise to the plant's alternative name, bog cotton.|$|E
5|$|Leigh next {{sought the}} role of Blanche DuBois in the West End stage {{production}} of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and was cast after Williams and the play's producer Irene Mayer Selznick saw her in The School for Scandal and Antigone; Olivier was contracted to direct. The play contained a rape scene and references to promiscuity and homosexuality, and {{was destined to be}} controversial; the media discussion about its <b>suitability</b> added to Leigh's anxiety. Nevertheless, she believed strongly in the importance of the work.|$|E
5|$|Ni no Kuni is {{a series}} of {{role-playing}} games developed by Level-5. The first games in the series chiefly follow the young Oliver, and his journey to another world to save his mother and stop the beckoning evil. An upcoming game will follow Evan Pettiwhisker Tildrum, a boy king who is usurped from his castle, and sets out to reclaim his kingdom. The games utilize several magic elements, allowing players to use magical abilities during gameplay, as well as creatures known as imajinn/familiars, which can be tamed for <b>suitability</b> during battle.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} sound design. Goldstein of IGN praised the actors' {{performances}} {{and the use}} of licensed music. GameSpot's Calvert and GamesRadar's Walter also commended the licensed music, the latter admiring the humour of the radio's talk stations. Michael Pinson of The Pro Audio Files praised the separate features of the game's sound design—including the city's ambiance, licensed music, character dialogue, and vehicle and weapon sound effects—applauding the developer's use of uniting the features together. Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar also retroactively praised the game's soundtrack, commending its <b>suitability</b> to the game's setting.|$|E
5|$|The {{reception}} of The Desert Fox in Britain was enthusiastic: the book went through eight editions in a year. Young's biography was another {{step in the}} development of the Rommel myth, with Rommel emerging as an active, if not a leading, plotter. Speidel contributed as well, starting, from the early 1950s, to bring up Rommel's and his own role in the plot, thus boosting Speidel's <b>suitability</b> for a future role in the new military force of the Federal Republic, the Bundeswehr, and then in NATO.|$|E
5|$|The stadium hosted {{its first}} concert on 16 April 2011, when Swedish ska group Hoffmaestro & Chraa performed. The concert {{was held at}} Ståplatstorget, the large area behind the Northern Stand terraces. The concert was {{attended}} by 3,000, {{and there were some}} concerns regarding the <b>suitability</b> of the venue after the concrete floor started rocking. However, safety checks the next day showed that the structure had not been damaged, and was suitable to host similar events in the future. On November 1, 2016, the stadium hosted a public mass led by Pope Francis as part of his two-day visit to Scania.|$|E
5|$|Three decades later, the East–West Telegraph {{line was}} installed. Constructed between 1875 and 1877, it {{followed}} the same route across the Nullarbor and along the Great Australian Bight, after John Forrest retraced Eyre's route in 1870 and confirmed its <b>suitability.</b> Repeater stations were installed at Port Lincoln, Streaky Bay, Smoky Bay, Fowlers Bay, Eucla, Israelite Bay, Esperance, and Bremer Bay. Stations were later added at Franklin Harbour (Cowell) in 1885, Yardea in 1896, and Balladonia in 1897.|$|E

25|$|The Norwegian Armed Forces never {{considered}} the <b>suitability</b> of Lista as an air base {{prior to the}} Second World War, despite its natural <b>suitability</b> in a flat, open landscape. The German occupation of Norway started on 9 April 1940 as part of Operation Weserübung. Lista was initially not prioritized by the Wehrmacht. The first landing of fifteen troops took place on 24 April, in an action to secure Lista Lighthouse.|$|E

25|$|In mid-February 1956, two Convair F-102A Delta Daggers and one Northrop F-89H Scorpion {{arrived at}} Eglin AFB to undergo {{operational}} <b>suitability</b> testing by the 3241st Test Group (Interceptor) with tests beginning in March 1956. Testing of the F-102A {{began in the}} first week of April under senior project officer Maj. Robert T. Goetz. It was expected that the AFOTC would conduct operational <b>suitability</b> tests on the TF-102 proficiency trainer version of the Delta Dagger in the near future.|$|E
25|$|The McDonnell F-101A Voodoo began 18 {{months of}} {{operational}} <b>suitability</b> testing at Eglin AFB from January 1956 by the Air Force Operational Test Center.|$|E
