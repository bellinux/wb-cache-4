2500|$|RMC's purview was {{expanded}} in 1995 as it [...] "became {{responsible for the}} initial military training of all full-time, part-time and <b>specialist</b> <b>service</b> officers in the Australian Army". This resulted in the centralisation of all officer training courses under the college's auspices; this included short courses for <b>specialist</b> <b>service</b> officers such as doctors, nurses, lawyers and chaplains, {{under the auspices of}} Romani Company, as well as the delivery of the final module of the Reserve officer training continuum. For a brief period, under the Ready Reserve Scheme, Reserve officers attended the college for a cut-down six-month version of the full-time course. For the full-time General Service Officer cadets, though, the program essentially unchanged from that which had been established after the formation of ADFA, when the course had been reduced to 18 months, and broken up into three distinct classes—III, II and I Class. Under this program, which has been maintained since 1986, cadets who wish to pursue a degree attend ADFA for three years upon appointment before going to Duntroon for 12 months, and starting the course in II Class.|$|E

2500|$|Huddersfield Royal Infirmary is {{situated}} in Lindley. Medical services are split between there and the Calderdale Royal Hospital at Salterhebble, near Halifax. Kirkwood Hospice provides care for the terminally ill, and is dependent on donations and charitable gifts. Princess Royal Hospital provided maternity facilities until the risks {{of not being able}} to get an ambulance to A in the event of complications were judged to outweigh the benefits of <b>specialist</b> <b>service</b> provision. It now functions as a day clinic, family planning consultation centre and GUM Clinic. A decision to move most maternity services provided by the Calderdale & Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust to the Calderdale Royal Hospital ended the provision in 2007, despite strong local opposition. The campaign was led by Save Huddersfield NHS which elected a councillor, Dr Jackie Grunsell in the Crosland Moor ward. [...] In January 2016 plans were announced to close the A department of Huddersfield Royal Infirmary and have all emergency cases go to Calderdale Royal instead. This sparked uproar in local communities as it would mean journeys from some areas of over 40 minutes to and from the hospital assuming that the main road into Halifax was not congested, as it frequently is.|$|E
