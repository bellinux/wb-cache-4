Here we show that the dynamics of the Barents Sea capelin (Mallotus villosus), the world's largest stock of this species, is strongly influenced by both within-system ecological feedback mechanisms and the impact of harvesting. Both overexploitation and predation by herring (Clupea harengus) can cause the population to collapse, whereas predation by cod (Gadus morhua) is demonstrated a delay in the <b>stock's</b> <b>recovery</b> after a collapse.

It is thus important to see what effects the QQE had on neighboring economies. Our empirical investigation of East Asian stock markets finds that they first reacted to the yen's depreciation negatively, yet came to respond positively as the QQE progressed, implying that the QQE had a much smaller beggar-thy-neighbor effect than was originally feared. We show that the QQE benefited East Asian economies because the positive spillover effect of Japan's <b>stock</b> market <b>recovery</b> dominated the beggar-thy-neighbor effect in the region...|$|R
40|$|In {{their recent}} paper Worm et al. (1) {{emphasize}} two important observations: that ocean biodiversity is generally beneficial for ecosystem services, including fisheries, and that numbers of overexploited or depleted stocks have increased over several decades. Both observations underpin {{the need for}} reducing fishing pressure and/or ensuring <b>stock</b> <b>recoveries.</b> Thus, the paper represents a useful contribution to the ongoing discussion. Unfortunately, the paper has two main flaws: Firstly the authors model the depletion of stocks {{as a function of}} time (year) which is then used to predict a 100 % collapse for all taxa currently fished by 2048, whereas the maximum observed in their data was only 30 %. Extrapolating 45 years into the future from a model with no mechanistic basis is extremely unsafe. Since the authors themselves mention "the inherent problem of inferring causality from correlation in the larger-scale studies" this prediction is even more problematic because it remains unclear how much any collapse can be explained by fisheries alone. Thus, it could be possible that the characteristics of the relationship will change at higher collapse levels (sigmoid, oscillating, [...] .). Secondly, the authors analyze the utility of marine closed areas and conclude that such closures, in general, are beneficial to marine ecosystems and fisheries. This analysis is based on a sample of case studies which is entirely unrepresentative of global fisheries; of the 49 papers which are the basis for this study, 27 are from coral reefs, while only 6 are from groundfish fisheries and none are from pelagic fisheries. The conclusions from such a subset cannot realistically be projected to the situation across global fisheries since groundfish and pelagic fisheries are by far the most important (2). 1) 	Worm et al.

40|$|The {{renewal of}} the {{forestry}} codes of {{the countries of the}} Congo Basin in the 90 's has legalized management plans for forest concessions. These plans intend, among other objectives, to ensure the sustainable exploitation of commercial species. Sustainability is assessed using the <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rate, which is defined in national directives as the ratio of the exploitable timber stock {{at the end of a}} felling cycle over the exploitable timber stock at the beginning of this cycle. Computing this rate requires forecasting the temporal development of each species during a felling cycle, which is usually achieved using the so-called “stock recovery formula”. This paper shows that this formula corresponds to a Leslie model, and then proposes a generalization as a Usher matrix model. Using the data from the M'Baïki experimental plots in the Central African Republic, the <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rate for sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum, Meliaceæ), a major timber species in Central Africa, was estimated. The estimate was completed by its confidence interval using bootstrap methods. Although 225 observations were available for sapelli, the <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rate was estimated with no more than an accuracy of about 45 % at confidence level 95 %. This did not permit to conclude whether the asymptotic <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rate was greater or less than one.

40|$|Designing {{permanent}} {{sample plots}} is a key issue in forestry where long-term data are required to assess the sustainability of forest logging. The data that are collected in {{permanent sample plots}} are used to set parameters in a population dynamics matrix model {{which in turn is}} used to predict <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rates for each species. The sampling plan for permanent plots can be designed to estimate <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rates with a required accuracy at a given confidence level, while minimizing installation costs. This can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem (one constraint for each species). The question then is to quantify sampling variability, i. e. the variability of model predictions that are generated by the distribution of parameter estimators. In this study, we address the question of sampling variability for a size-classified population matrix model in a hierarchical context where sample size is itself random and driven by a multivariate spatial point process. An approximate expression is given for the accuracy of the <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rate estimator. This expression is the limit of the accuracy as the expectation of sample size tends to ∞. We extend this expression to the multispecies case. To a first approximation, interactions between species do not affect the accuracy of the <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rate for each species. A sampling plan is designed using the data for three species in a tropical rainforest in French Guiana. The optimal sampling plan appears to be determined by the most constrained species.

40|$|After {{the change}} of the {{forestry}} laws in six Central African countries in the 1990 s, the <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rate-the ratio of the exploitable timber stock {{at the end of}} a felling cycle over the initial pre-felling stock-has become the standard index to assess timber yield sustainability. The Dimako formula, that is the legal expression of the <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rate, is not necessarily the best estimate of this index. In particular, it accounts for only a limited knowledge on vital rates, it does not always increase with the diameter cutting limit, and it is negatively sensitive to the number of trees above the cutting limit, which may promote heavy initial logging when assessing forest management over several felling cycles. Here, we show that the Dimako formula can be generalised by using a more detailed model of forest dynamics, or a finer description of logging damage, and we demonstrate that an alternative formula has better properties. We used four species with contrasted initial diameter distribution, inventoried in the Dimako forest, eastern Cameroon, to illustrate the behaviour of alternative formula. If an increased level of details had to be incorporated in the Dimako formula, boosted post-logging growth should be considered at first. Because the <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rate results from the combined influence of the initial dbh distribution of the species, which is a history-dependent feature of the population, and of its vital rates, which is an ecological species-specific feature of the population, its interpretation must at least take account of the autecology of the species. Particular caution must be taken when applying the formula to groups of species rather than to single species. The <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rate alone gives a reductionist insight into yield sustainability. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Permanent {{sample plots}} (PSP), where trees are {{individually}} and permanently marked, have received {{increased interest in}} Central Africa {{as a tool to}} monitor vegetation changes. Although techniques for mounting PSP in tropical forests are well known, their planning still deserves attention. This study aims at defining a rationale for determining the size and number of replicates for setting up PSP in mixed tropical forests. It considers PSP as a sampling plan to estimate a target quantity with its associated margin of error. The target quantity considered here is the <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rate, which is a key parameter for forest management in Central Africa. It is computed separately for each commercial species. The number of trees to monitor for each species defines the margin of error on the <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rate. The size and number of replicated plots is obtained as the solution of an optimization problem that consists in minimizing the margin of error for every species while ensuring that the mounting cost remains below a given threshold. This rationale was applied using the data from the M'Baïki experimental site in the Central African Republic. It showed that the <b>stock</b> <b>recovery</b> rate is a highly variable quantity, and that the typical cost that forest managers are prone to devote to PSP leads to high margins of error. It also showed that the size and number of replicated plots is related to the spatial pattern of trees: clustered or spatially heterogeneous patterns favor many small plots, whereas regular or spatially homogeneous patterns favor few large plots.
