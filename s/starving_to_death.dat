5|$|In the Shetland Islands, sand eels (Ammodytes marinus) {{normally}} form {{at least}} 90% {{of the food}} fed to chicks. It was found that, in years where the availability of sand eels was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks <b>starving</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> In Norway it is the herring (Clupea harengus) that is the mainstay of the diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers. In Labrador the puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, {{they were able to}} adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.|$|E
5|$|The {{governments of}} Oaxaca and Guerrero asked UNICEF for assistance, {{specifically}} water tanks, water pumps, and construction material. International aid initially focused almost {{solely on the}} damage in Acapulco. By {{a week after the}} hurricane, 500communities in Oaxaca remained isolated and without assistance, with several large communities in Guerrero not receiving any material aid by a week after the hurricane. The Adventist Development and Relief Agency organized about 7tons of food and clothing, and sent a bus of 40people to help isolated villages in southern Mexico. Around ten days after the hurricane struck, 20,000people were still isolated from emergency crews and relief works, causing the president to suspect people could begin <b>starving</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Helicopters were initially sent to the remote areas, though severe fog and heavy rainfall after the hurricane grounded the operations. The government worked to bring food to remote mountain communities, though officials noted the serious risk in doing so.|$|E

25|$|Major famines {{occurred}} in India every {{five to eight}} years in the 19th- and early 20th-centuries, resulting in millions <b>starving</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> As also happened in China, these events begat infanticide: desperate starving parents would either kill a suffering infant, sell a child to buy food {{for the rest of the}} family, or beg people to take them away for nothing and feed them. Gupta and Shuzhou state that massive famines and poverty-related historical events had influenced historical sex ratios, and they have had deep cultural ramifications on girls and regional attitudes towards female infant mortality.|$|E
25|$|In Honduras, the Red Cross {{and other}} relief {{agencies}} quickly attempted to unload planes {{to assure that}} supplies would reach victims. However, some of the supplies were hoarded by the Honduran military as they quickly went to unload the planes. One of the incidents took place after a plane carrying supplies from Argentina landed and the military forced the volunteer members away from the plane. Once {{in the hands of}} the military, the fate of the supplies was unknown. As the full amount of supplies did not reach victims, reports of people <b>starving</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> surfaced. Eventually, relief crews found these reports to be true as they distributed food to those who survived.|$|E

In October 1958, the Communist Party calculated that some 1.6 billion big-character posters denouncing them had been written. People who did not put up posters risked being labelled [...] "little Pan Fusheng". Pan was dismissed from office and sent {{to work as a}} laborer on a farm. Wu Zhipu replaced Pan as First Secretary of Henan and zealously implemented Mao's collectivization policy.

On the evening of Diefenbaker's Vancouver speech, St. Laurent drew 400voters to a rally in Sherbrooke, Quebec, where he had once lived. C.D. Howe, under heavy pressure from the campaign of CCF candidate Doug Fisher in his Ontario riding, intimated that Fisher had communist links. At a rally in Manitoba, Howe offended a voter who told him the farmers were <b>starving</b> <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> poking the voter in the stomach and saying [...] "Looks like you've been eating pretty well under a Liberal government."

In fact, why don't you just go away?" ...|$|E
500|$|Foxton died on 14 February 1829, and Calcraft was {{appointed}} as his successor. He {{was sworn in}} as the official Executioner for the City of London and Middlesex on 4 April 1829, a position for which he was paid one guinea a week plus an additional guinea for each execution. He also received an allowance for cats o' nine tails and birch rods, and supplemented his income by selling sections of the rope used to hang his victims, for which he charged between five shillings and £1 per inch. Calcraft's first duty in his new role was the execution of Thomas Lister and George Wingfield, hanged together on 27 March 1829, Lister for burglary and Wingfield for highway robbery. Esther Hibner, known in the press as the [...] "Evil Monster", was the first woman hanged by Calcraft. She was executed on 13 April 1829, having been found guilty of <b>starving</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> her apprentice, Frances Colppits. Hibner did not go to the scaffold willingly, but had to be restrained in a straitjacket to prevent her from attacking her executioners.

500|$|The sarus crane (Antigone antigone) {{is a large}} {{non-migratory}} crane {{found in}} parts of the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Australia. The tallest of the flying birds, standing at a height of up to , they are conspicuous and iconic species of open wetlands. The sarus crane is easily distinguished from other cranes in the region by the overall grey colour and the contrasting red head and upper neck. They forage on marshes and shallow wetlands for roots, tubers, insects, crustaceans and small vertebrate prey. Like other cranes, they form long-lasting pair-bonds and maintain territories within which they perform territorial and courtship displays that include loud trumpeting, leaps and dance-like movements. In India they are considered symbols of marital fidelity, believed to mate for life and pine the loss of their mates {{even to the point of}} <b>starving</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> The main breeding season is during the rainy season, when the pair builds an enormous nest [...] "island", a circular platform of reeds and grasses nearly two metres in diameter and high enough to stay above the shallow water surrounding it. Sarus crane numbers have declined greatly in the last century and it has been suggested that the current population is a tenth or less (perhaps 2.5%) of the numbers that existed in the 1850s. The stronghold of the species is in India, where it is traditionally revered and lives in agricultural lands in close proximity to humans. Elsewhere, the species has been extirpated in many parts of its former range.|$|E
