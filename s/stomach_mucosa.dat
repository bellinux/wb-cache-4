40|$|Recently, the veterinarians {{are dealing}} with a number of cases that require {{forensic}} expertise. Such a circumstance could be the accidental electrocution in animals, one of the causes of unnatural death. There is a scarcity with reference to the pathological findings in veterinary forensic medicine. In this paper, we present the main lesions that occurred in a horse with accidental electrocution that was presented for complete necropsy survey. A horse corpse was sent to the Pathology Department (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cluj-Napoca, Romania) for a full medical survey. Preliminary results and external examination: the body was in rigor mortis; from the nasal cavities drained out reddish foam and in the mouth was observed the presence of ingested feed (straw) that was not chewed, suggesting a quick death. The findings detected after internal examination of the carcass were poor blood coagulability, haemorrhagic diathesis throughout the body, with haemorrhages of various sizes in different body regions (e. g., muscles of the withers, in the gluteal muscle, the mucosa of epiglottis, larynx, trachea, in the interstitium of the lung, and ecchymosis in the left kidney). Some other lesions detected were infarcts and haemorrhages in the fundic region of the <b>stomach’s</b> <b>mucosa.</b> In electrocution, haemorrhages are most often located in the respiratory tract, aspect observed in our case too. However, the diagnosis of electrocution has to corroborate the necropsy findings (which are not specific), with some other data such as the fulminant death and inspection of power source...|$|R
5000|$|One of its {{functions}} is to {{keep the}} tissue moist (for example in the respiratory tract, including the mouth and nose). It also plays a role in absorbing and transforming nutrients.

50|$|Atrophic {{gastritis}} (also {{known as}} Type A or Type B Gastritis more specifically) {{is a process}} of chronic inflammation of the <b>stomach</b> <b>mucosa,</b> leading to loss of gastric glandular cells and their eventual replacement by intestinal and fibrous tissues. As a result, the stomach's secretion of essential substances such as hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and intrinsic factor is impaired, leading to digestive problems. The most common are vitamin B12 deficiency which results in a megaloblastic anemia and malabsorbtion of iron, leading to iron deficiency anaemia. It can be caused by persistent infection with Helicobacter pylori, or can be autoimmune in origin. Those with the autoimmune version of atrophic gastritis are statistically more likely to develop gastric carcinoma, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and achlorhydria.|$|E

50|$|Once chromium(III) picolinate is {{ingested}} {{and enters}} the stomach, acidic hydrolysis of the complex occurs when {{in contact with the}} <b>stomach</b> <b>mucosa.</b> The hydrolyzed Cr3+ is present in the hexaaqua form and polymerizes to form an insoluble Cr(III)-hydroxide-oxide (the process of olation) once it reaches the alkaline pH of the small intestine. Approximately 2% of Cr3+ is absorbed through the gut as chromium(III) picolinate via unsaturated passive transport. Although absorption is low, CrPic3 absorbs more efficiently than other organic and inorganic sources (i.e. CrCl3 and chromium nicotinate) and thus accumulate at higher concentrations in tissues. This has been one major selling point for chromium(III) picolinate over other chromium(III) supplements. Organic sources tend to absorb better as they have ligands which are more lipophilic and usually neutralize the charge of the metal, thus permitting for easier passage through the intestinal membrane.|$|E

Of the different surgical techniques, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a treatment for early gastric cancer (tumor only involves the mucosa) that was pioneered in Japan and {{is available in the}} United States at some centers. In this procedure, the tumor, together with the inner lining of <b>stomach</b> (<b>mucosa),</b> is removed from the wall of the stomach using an electrical wire loop through the endoscope.

If the pathologic examination of the resected specimen shows incomplete resection or deep invasion by tumor, the patient would need a formal stomach resection.

40|$|Abstract Background Mucus {{overproduction}} is {{a characteristic}} of inflammatory pulmonary diseases including asthma, chronic bronchitis, and cystic fibrosis. Expression of two mucin genes, MUC 2 and MUC 5 AC, and their protein products (mucins), is modulated in certain disease states. Understanding the signaling mechanisms that regulate the production and secretion of these major mucus components may contribute significantly to development of effective therapies to modify their expression in inflamed airways. Methods To study the differential expression of Muc 2 and Muc 5 ac, a novel monoclonal antibody recognizing guinea pig Muc 2 and a commercially-available antibody against human MUC 5 AC were optimized for recognition of specific guinea pig mucins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). These antibodies were then used to analyze expression of Muc 2 and another mucin subtype (likely Muc 5 ac) in guinea pig tracheal epithelial (GPTE) cells stimulated {{with a mixture of}} pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 β (IL- 1 β), and interferon- γ (IFN-γ) ]. Results The anti-Muc 2 (C 4) and anti-MUC 5 AC (45 M 1) monoclonal antibodies specifically recognized proteins located in Muc 2 -dominant small intestinal and Muc 5 ac-dominant <b>stomach</b> <b>mucosae,</b> respectively, in both Western and ELISA experimental protocols. IHC protocols confirmed that C 4 recognizes murine small intestine mucosal proteins while 45 M 1 does not react. C 4 and 45 M 1 also stained specific epithelial cells in guinea pig lung sections. In the resting state, Muc 2 was recognized as a highly expressed intracellular mucin in GPTE cells in vitro. Following cytokine exposure, secretion of Muc 2, but not the mucin recognized by the 45 M 1 antibody (likely Muc 5 ac), was increased from the GPTE cells, with a concomitant increase in intracellular expression of both mucins. Conclusion Given the tissue specificity in IHC and the differential hybridization to high molecular weight proteins by Western blot, we conclude that the antibodies used in this study can recognize specific mucin subtypes in guinea pig airway epithelium and in proteins from GPTE cells. In addition, Muc 2 is highly expressed constitutively, modulated by inflammation, and secreted differentially (as compared to Muc 5 ac) in GPTE cells. This finding contrasts with expression patterns in the airway epithelium of a variety of mammalian species in which only Muc 5 ac predominates. </p...|$|R

There was no significant difference in the basal or histamine stimulated gastric acid secretion between wild-type or heterozygous or homozygous mice. However, isobutyl methylxanthine was more potent in the cyclooxygenase- 1 deficient and heterozygous mice than in wild-type mice. Indomethacin, at concentrations below 1 mM, had no effect on either basal or histamine stimulated acid secretion in any of the mice populations. Gastric acid secretion is maintained without prostaglandin involvement in cyclooxygenase- 1 deficient mice.
