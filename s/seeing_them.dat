5|$|In 2009, Dal Sasso et al.. {{reported}} {{the results of}} X-ray computed tomography of the MSNM V4047 snout. As the foramina on the outside all communicated with a space {{on the inside of}} the snout, the authors speculated that Spinosaurus had pressure receptors inside the space that allowed it to hold its snout at the surface of the water to detect swimming prey species without <b>seeing</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mary Jane {{admits she}} is {{infatuated}} with Spider-Man, who has rescued her on numerous occasions, and asks Peter whether Spider-Man ever asked about her.

Devastated, Harry tells {{his father that}} Peter loves Mary Jane, unintentionally revealing Spider-Man's biggest weakness.|$|E
5|$|After Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson {{kept her}} promise and burned {{most of the}} poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no {{instructions}} about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest. Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with <b>seeing</b> <b>them</b> published. She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance. A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry {{for more than half}} a century.|$|E

The other woman, left at the car, becomes curious and follows them into the woods. Upon <b>seeing</b> <b>them,</b> she becomes sexually aroused and stimulates herself. Meanwhile, {{the man and the}} previous woman have sex in the missionary position. Soon after, the other woman joins them and the man has sex with her doggy style. Later, they have a threesome, and one of the women subsequently gives the man fellatio. After finishing the sexual acts, they return to the car.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{anti-ice}} {{was turned}} {{on for the}} two engines during taxi. The captain announced to passengers that the flaps would remain up during taxi, and {{they should not be}} worried <b>seeing</b> <b>them</b> in the retracted position. He placed an empty coffee cup on the flap handle as a reminder of the position of the flaps, a procedure used by many flight crews. The captain told the first officer they would use standard USAir contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps, and also decided that they would take off with a reduced V1 speed of 110 knots.|$|E
5|$|Government {{publications}} on {{the dangers}} of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, <b>seeing</b> <b>them</b> as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, {{in large part because of}} public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services.|$|E

5|$|Leigh-Mallory {{claimed the}} Big Wings had {{destroyed}} entire formations of enemy aircraft upon <b>seeing</b> <b>them.</b> He even claimed the RAF outnumbered their opponents in several engagements. In the afternoon battle, {{he claimed that}} the Wing could not get into position {{to break up the}} bombers in time and was intercepted by German fighters. Still, while that was true he also claimed his units had shot down 105 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed a further 40. He claimed another 18 damaged for the loss of 14 and six pilots.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution of 1810 {{marked the}} {{early stage of}} a process which later led to the {{disintegration}} of Spain's Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, independence and the eventual formation of Argentina. Rosas, like many landowners in the countryside, was suspicious of a movement advanced primarily by merchants and bureaucrats {{in the city of}} Buenos Aires. Rosas was specially outraged by the execution of Viceroy Santiago Liniers {{at the hands of the}} revolutionaries. Rosas felt nostalgic about colonial times, <b>seeing</b> <b>them</b> as stable, orderly and prosperous.|$|E

Since the 2007–08 season, Andover {{had been a}} member of the Southern League Division One South and West at Step 4 of the National League System (i.e. four divisions below the English Football League). The club played at this level for 29 of its 128years of existence, and played its thousandth game in this league in 2008.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} of Voysey's design near Bowness-on-Windermere, Cumbria, with roughcast walls and massive rendered stacks on sweeping slate roofs.

5|$|Makinti's {{first contact}} with white people was <b>seeing</b> <b>them</b> riding camels, {{when she was}} living at Lupul. She {{was one of a}} large group of people who walked into Haasts Bluff in the early 1940s, {{together}} with her husband Nyukuti Tjupurrula (brother of artist Nosepeg Tjupurrula), and their son Ginger Tjakamarra, born around 1940. At Haasts Bluff they had a second child, Narrabri Narrapayi, in 1949. The population moved to Papunya in the late 1950s, where Makinti had another child, Jacqueline Daaru, in 1958. She had a daughter, Winnie Bernadette, in 1961 in Alice Springs. The family moved to Kintore when it was established in the early 1980s, and by 1996 Kumentje was painting there for the Papunya Tula Artists Cooperative. Her children Ginger, Narrabri, and Jacqueline also became artists, all of them painting for Papunya Tula Artists.|$|E
5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral cats vary widely, ranging from <b>seeing</b> <b>them</b> as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E
5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, I asked {{him where he}} was from. He said he was from Hawaii!

There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed <b>seeing</b> <b>them</b> very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E

5|$|After {{his arrival}} in New England, Wheelwright preached {{primarily}} to the Boston settlers who owned land at Mount Wollaston, still considered a part of Boston, but located about ten {{miles south of the}} Boston meetinghouse. Within months, someone had alerted magistrate John Winthrop, a lay person in the Boston church, that Wheelwright was harboring familist and antinomian doctrines. Familism, the theology of the Family of Love, involved one's perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit, coupled with freedom from both sin, and the responsibility for it. Antinomianism, or being freed from moral law under the covenant of grace, was a form of familism. Most of the New England Puritan ministers were adamantly opposed to these theological doctrines, <b>seeing</b> <b>them</b> as the cause of the violent and bloody ravages of the anabaptists in Germany during the Münster Rebellion of the 1530s. When confronted with accusations of familism, Wheelwright denied preaching such a doctrine. While Winthrop and many of the colony's ministers may have viewed Wheelwright as a familist, Cotton saw him as an orthodox minister.|$|E
5|$|Lewis {{enters a}} country pub and {{unexpectedly}} meets Audrey {{and her daughter}} Gail. Upon <b>seeing</b> <b>them,</b> he pretends he is his own identical twin brother. Neither Audrey or Gail are fooled and Lewis offers {{to pay for their}} drinks. He then leaves the pub and heads to Coronation Street. Lewis visits Peter Barlow, apologises for stealing from him and returns the money he took with an extra £1000 as compensation. Lewis then goes to Audrey's salon and he tells her he did not mean to hurt her. He asks Audrey to drive him to the police station to prove how sorry he is. After he is given bail, Lewis enters the Rovers Return and is punched by Deirdre. Lewis faces hostility from Audrey's grandson, David (Jack P. Shepherd) upon his return to the salon. He begs Audrey for forgiveness but she throws him out. Lewis sends her flowers and Audrey visits his address and finds he is living in a bedsit. David's wife, Kylie (Paula Lane), introduces herself to Lewis and he defends her against Brian Packham's (Peter Gunn) accusations that she is giving her son the wrong food.|$|E

25|$|Weber {{shows that}} certain {{branches}} of Protestantism had supported worldly activities dedicated to economic gain, <b>seeing</b> <b>them</b> as endowed with {{moral and spiritual}} significance.
