In his sugar house McIntosh installed what was, according to Thomas Spalding, the first horizontal cane mill worked by cattle power. McIntosh, born in 1773 in what is now McIntosh County, settled in East Florida as a young man and became a leader of a group of American citizens who, during the War of 1812, plotted the annexation of East Florida to the United States. This plot crushed by the Spanish government, McIntosh removed to Georgia and acquired two plantations in Camden County, Marian, where he built a home, and New Canaan, where he began the cultivation of sugar cane under the influence of Thomas Spalding, who had experimented in sugar production and seen the use of steam-propelled horizontal cane mills in Louisiana. After McIntosh 2 ̆ 7 s death in 1836, New Canaan was sold to one Col. Hallowes, who changed the name of the plantation to Bollingbrook and lived there until after the Civil War.

Three days before the wedding, the man of the house would invite his kinfolks to discuss about who should be invited to the wedding. Apart from the people who would make the invitations, others were appointed to serve in the wedding. The following day, the people involved, which included friends, family, relatives and women in the house would continue the preparations of various dishes such as cleaning the wheat for the [...] "qyshkek" [...] (boiled grain in <b>sugar),</b> which <b>marked</b> the beginning of the wedding.

On the wedding day, people would come to congratulate the family early in the morning, whereas in the evening, only those who were invited to the wedding would show up. The guests would bring presents with them for the couple; usually the women would bring pies, and the men, two kilograms of sugar. Among the men, various songs were sung with the cifteli and lute (traditional Albanian instruments) while comedic acts were played on one another. Among the women, two tambourine players would sing rhythmical songs to which women would dance.

40|$|These {{clinical}} and biochemical studies {{were made on}} the basis of the blood ketone bodies in 368 clinically healthy dairy cows. The result thus obtained may be summarized as follows. 1. The values for the blood ketone bodies of the clinically healthy cows varied so widely that they were statistically divided into 2 groups, viz., "normal and sub-normal groups. " 2. The mean values for the ketone bodies of the normal group were 3. 11 (0. 99 〜 11. 17) mg/ 100 ml in total ketone, and 0. 79 (0. 22 〜 4. 53) mg/ 100 ml in free acetone. 3. The mean values for the ketone bodies of the sub-normal group were 39. 10 (12. 30 〜 73. 80) mg/ 100 ml in total ketone, and 8. 23 (5. 20 〜 10. 50) mg/ 100 ml in free acetone. 4. The values for free acetone, acetoacetic acid and β-hydroxybutyric acid increased in accordance with the increase of the total ketone. 5. All of the internal and external factors exerted influence upon the rise and fall of the total ketone, especially, it may be supposed that the stress of parturition, milk yield, season and feeding-management were very important. 6. It was clarified that the sub-normal group showed not only the increase of the ketone bodies but also increase of the blood <b>sugar</b> level and <b>marked</b> decrease in number of eosinophilic leucocytes...|$|R
