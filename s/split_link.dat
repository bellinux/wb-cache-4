40|$|Introduction and Statement of Results Recently, {{the notion}} of surgery {{equivalence}} of links, in particular algebraically <b>split</b> <b>links,</b> {{has emerged as a}} key ingredient in the study of nite type 3 -manifold invariants (see [O], [Le], [GL], [H 1], [H 2]). Links up to surgery equivalence were classied by Levine [L]. The intent of this note is to tie the classication of braids up to surgery equivalence to the lower central series of the pure braid group. One could deduce the statement of the theorem below indirectly from the results of [L], or [GL]. However, we will show that there is a short direct argument, using Milnor invariants. As a corollary of this line of reasoning, one can then deduce Levine's classication of surgery equivalence for algebraically <b>split</b> <b>links</b> (i. e., for links with vanishing linking numbers). Recall that one may dene the linking number of an oriented knot K with another oriented knot K 0 as the intersection numbe...|$|R

40|$|We use {{the knot}} {{homology}} of Khovanov and Lee to construct link concordance invariants generalizing the Rasmussen $s$-invariant of knots.

A corollary of this construction is that any component preserving orientable cobordism from a $\Kh$-thin link to a link split into $k$ components must have genus at least $\lfloor\frac k 2 \rfloor$.

This paper presents counterexamples to the conjecture of Lin and Wang and gives a proof of a corrected statement of the conjecture. The statement {{is divided into two}} parts.
