5|$|Workmen {{discover}} a pre-human skull while {{building in the}} fictional Hobbs Lane (formerly Hob's Lane, Hob being an antiquated name for the Devil) in Knightsbridge, London. Dr Matthew Roney, a paleontologist, examines the remains and reconstructs a dwarf-like humanoid with a large brain volume, which he believes to be a primitive man.

5|$|After {{the events}} of the season six finale, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) are desperately {{attempting}} to find the truth behind the so-called alien object. Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Skinner are unaware of FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley's (Mimi Rogers) duplicity—she is working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). Scully then travels to Africa to unravel the secrets of the alien artifacts, finding <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a spaceship buried under the shoreline off the Côte d'Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. Cigarette Smoking Man has taken Mulder to a place where all his problems seem to have disappeared. Fowley helps Scully locate Mulder, which leads to her death at the hands of Cigarette Smoking Man.|$|E

500|$|After {{the success}} of {{previous}} live-action promotional shorts, Landfall and The Life, 343 Industries, the studio in charge of development for the Halo franchise, wanted to use a live action series to appeal {{to an audience of}} people unfamiliar with the Halo games. The director of franchise business management at 343 Industries, Matt McClosky, explained the intended audience by saying that, [...] "You see <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a video game, you're going to get the same crowd you always get." [...] The live-action format was also chosen for its ability to better develop characters; the series is used to introduce the character Thomas Lasky to the Halo universe before his role in the video game Halo 4. The developers wanted a protagonist with more emotion than Master Chief (whose face is never seen), to not only convey an understanding of the universe, but to better engage unfamiliar viewers.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{liked the}} site {{so much that}} he did not even visit an {{alternative}} site in Hyde Park; he felt that the sculpture might have been lost in such a big park, recalling an experience he had trying to find the sculpture Riva by Jacob Epstein in the park. He welcomed the fact that the sculpture would be next to a public path and would have seating nearby to allow contemplation, and compared the gardens favourably with the setting for Hubert Le Sueur’s equestrian statue of Charles I at Charing Cross, “which, in order to look at closely and appreciate in detail, you have to risk your life in crossing a maze of traffic”. The siting of the sculpture was disliked by some, with Neil Marten MP asking Parliament why [...] "this lovely part of Westminster should be littered with <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a crashed unidentified flying object." ...|$|E

2500|$|The case of {{the radical}} 艸 (U+8278) proves how {{arbitrary}} the state of affairs is. When used to compose characters like 草 (U+8349), the radical was placed at the top, but had two different forms. Traditional Chinese and Korean use a four-stroke version. At the top of 草 should be <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> [...] "+ +". Simplified Chinese, Kyūjitai Japanese and Shinjitai Japanese use a three-stroke version (艹). The PRC's text encoding bodies did not encode the two variants differently. The fact that almost every other change {{brought about by the}} PRC, no matter how minor, did warrant a unique codepoint suggests that this exception may have been unintentional. Unicode copied the existing standards as is, preserving such irregularities.|$|E

60|$|There are six {{things that}} on man's part are the cause he receiveth not {{the gospel of}} Christ, and so life by him--1. They see not their state by nature, how {{polluted}} they are with original sin (Eph 2:2). 2. They see not the justice of God against sin; they know not him that hath said, 'Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense' (Heb 10:30). 3. They cannot see the beauty of Jesus Christ (2 Cor 4:4). 4. Unbelief being mighty in them, they dare not venture their souls with Jesus Christ. They dare not trust to his righteousness, and to that only (Rev 21:8). For, 5. Their carnal reason also sets itself against the word of faith, and cannot stoop to the grace of Jesus Christ (1 Cor 2:14). 6. They love to have honour one of another, they love {{to be commended for}} their own vain-glorious righteousness; and the fools think that because they are commended of men, they shall be commended of God also: 'How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?' (John 5:44). This last thing--to wit, desire of vain-glory, is the bane of thousands; it is the legalist's bane, it is the civilian's[37] bane, it is the formalist's bane, yea, which yet is stranger, it is the bane of the vicious and debauched also;[38] for though there be a generation that, to one's thinking, have not regard to righteousness, yet watch them narrowly, and they have their times of doing <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> good, and though possibly it be but seldom, yet this wretch counteth that, for the sake of that, God accepteth him, and counteth his, glorious righteousness. I might add a seventh cause, which is, want of serious meditation upon eternal judgment, and what shall follow. This consideration, did it take a deep place in the heart, would doubtless produce these workings of spirit after Jesus Christ for justification that now are wanting in the most of men. This made Felix, yea, it makes the devils, tremble; and would, I say, couldst thou deeply meditate, make thee start and turn thy wanton thoughts into heavy sighs after God's mercy in Jesus Christ, lest thou also come into their place of torment.|$|E
6000|$|For my part I could {{much sooner}} believe in an {{unsinkable}} ship of 3,000 tons than {{in one of}} 40,000 tons. It {{is one of those}} things that stand to reason. You can't increase the thickness of scantling and plates indefinitely. And the mere weight of this bigness is an added disadvantage. In reading the reports, the first reflection which occurs to one is that, if that luckless ship had been a couple of hundred feet shorter, she would have probably gone clear of the danger. But then, perhaps, she could not have had a swimming bath and a French cafe. That, of course, is a serious consideration. I am well aware that those responsible for her short and fatal existence ask us in desolate accents to believe that if she had hit end on she would have survived. Which, by a sort of coy implication, seems to mean that it was all the fault of the officer of the watch (he is dead now) for trying to avoid the obstacle. We shall have presently, in deference to commercial and industrial interests, a new kind of seamanship. A very new and [...] "progressive" [...] kind. If you see anything in the way, by no means try to avoid it; smash at it full tilt. And then--and then only you shall see the triumph of material, of clever contrivances, of the whole box of engineering tricks in fact, and cover with glory a commercial concern of the most unmitigated sort, a great Trust, and a great ship-building yard, justly famed for the super-excellence of its material and workmanship. Unsinkable! See? I told you she was unsinkable, if only handled in accordance with the new seamanship. Everything's in that. And, doubtless, the Board of Trade, if properly approached, would consent to give the needed instructions to its examiners of Masters and Mates. Behold the examination-room of the future. Enter to the grizzled examiner a young man of modest aspect: [...] "Are you well up in modern seamanship?" [...] "I hope so, sir." [...] "H'm, let's see. You are at night on the bridge in charge of a 150,000 tons ship, with a motor track, organ- loft, etc., etc., with a full cargo of passengers, a full crew of 1,500 cafe waiters, two sailors and a boy, three collapsible boats as per Board of Trade regulations, and going at your three-quarter speed of, say, about forty knots. You perceive suddenly right ahead, and close to, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a large ice-floe. What would you do?" [...] "Put the helm amidships." [...] "Very well. Why?" [...] "In order to hit end on." [...] "On what grounds should you endeavour to hit end on?" [...] "Because we are taught by our builders and masters that the heavier the smash, the smaller the damage, and because the requirements of material should be attended to." ...|$|E

6000|$|Another {{portrait}} which irresistibly {{attracted the}} eye was the half-length of Robert M'Queen, of Braxfield, Lord Justice-Clerk. If I know gusto in painting when I see it, this canvas was painted with rare enjoyment. The tart, rosy, humorous {{look of the}} man, his nose like a cudgel, his face resting squarely on the jowl, has been caught and perpetuated with <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> brotherly love. A peculiarly subtle expression haunts the lower part, sensual and incredulous, {{like that of a}} man tasting good Bordeaux with half a fancy it has been somewhat too long uncorked. From under the pendulous eye-lids of old age the eyes look out with a half-youthful half-frosty twinkle. Hands, with no pretence to distinction, are folded on the judge's stomach. So sympathetically is the character conceived by the portrait-painter, that it is hardly possible to avoid some movement of sympathy {{on the part of the}} spectator. And sympathy is a thing to be encouraged, apart from humane considerations, because it supplies us with the materials for wisdom. It is probably more instructive to entertain a sneaking kindness for any unpopular person, and among the rest, for Lord Braxfield, than to give way to perfect raptures of moral indignation against his abstract vices. He was the last judge on the Scots bench to employ the pure Scots idiom. His opinions, thus given in Doric, and conceived in a lively, rugged, conversational style, were full of point and authority. Out of the bar, or off the bench, he was a convivial man, a lover of wine, and one who [...] "shone perculiarly" [...] at tavern meetings. He has left behind him an unrivalled reputation for rough and cruel speech; and to this day his name smacks of the gallows. It was he who presided at the trials of Muir and Skirving in 1793 and 1794; and his appearance on these occasions was scarcely cut to the pattern of to-day. His summing up on Muir began thus--the reader must supply for himself [...] "the growling blacksmith's voice" [...] and the broad Scots accent: [...] "Now this is the question for consideration--Is the panel guilty of sedition, or is he not? Now, before this can be answered, two things must be attended to that require no proof: First, that the British constitution is the best that ever was since the creation of the world, and it is not possible to make it better." [...] It's a pretty fair start, is it not, for a political trial? A little later, he has occasion to refer to the relations of Muir with [...] "those wretches," [...] the French. [...] "I never liked the French all my days," [...] said his Lordship, [...] "but now I hate them." [...] And yet a little further on: [...] "A government in any country should be like a corporation; and in this country it is made up of the landed interest, which alone has a right to be represented. As for the rabble who have nothing but personal property, what hold has the nation of them? They may pack up their property on their backs, and leave the country in the twinkling of an eye." [...] After having made profession of sentiments so cynically anti-popular as these, when the trials were at an end, which was generally about midnight, Braxfield would walk home to his house in George Square with no better escort than an easy conscience. I think I see him getting his cloak about his shoulders, and, with perhaps a lantern in one hand, steering his way along the streets in the mirk January night. It might have been that very day that Skirving had defied him in these words: [...] "It is altogether unavailing for your lordship to menace me; for I have long learned to fear not the face of man"; and I can fancy, as Braxfield reflected on the number of what he called Grumbletonians in Edinburgh, and of how many of them must bear special malice against so upright and inflexible a judge, nay, and might at that very moment be lurking in the mouth of a dark close with hostile intent--I can fancy that he indulged in a sour smile, as he reflected that he also was not especially afraid of men's faces or men's fists, and had hitherto found no occasion to embody this insensibility in heroic words. For if he was an inhumane old gentleman (and I am afraid it is a fact that he was inhumane), he was also perfectly intrepid. You may look into the queer face of that portrait for as long as you will, but you will not see any hole or corner for timidity to enter in.|$|E
