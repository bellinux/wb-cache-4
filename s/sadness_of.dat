5|$|The <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} {{of those days}} is captured by the simple epitaph on the gravestone of James Myers who is buried in the Methodist Cemetery at Yeadon behind the Town Hall. James was a married man just 22 years old who 'died by an accident in the Bramhope Tunnel on the 14th day of April, 1848'. Next to him lies the body of his 3 years old daughter who died two weeks later of some unspecified illness.|$|E
5|$|In later life, she {{eventually}} adopted more conventional behaviour, took up pious works and even reformed the convent that became her second {{residence in the}} Paris suburbs. As {{the years went by}} she suffered serious setbacks to her health and the <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> mourning her eldest son, Grand Prince Ferdinando, for whom she had had a genuine affection. Rendered financially independent by a legacy, she purchased a house in Paris, from which she spent {{the end of her life}} dispensing charity and keeping up dignified correspondence.|$|E

25|$|It {{was about}} the same time, 1792, that the unaccountable <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> his life and his {{timidity}} moved the compassion of 24-year-old Renée-Françoise-Adélaïde Le Monnier, daughter of his friend, the astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier. She insisted on marrying him, and proved a devoted wife to whom he became warmly attached.|$|E
25|$|The film is {{dedicated}} to director/screenwriter Jim Sheridan's brother Frankie, who {{died at the age}} of ten. In The Making of in America, a featurette on the DVD release of the film, Sheridan explains Christy and Ariel are based on his daughters (and co-writers) Naomi and Kirsten. He says they wanted to make a film showing how people can learn to overcome their pain and live for the future instead of dwelling on the <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> the past.|$|E
25|$|The body found beside Alistair in the {{original}} investigation was not that of his wife, but that of Dorothea; Margaret had died a month earlier {{at the hands of}} her sister, who fatally injured her as part of a psychotic episode. Before she died, she made her husband promise to protect her sister from arrest, to which both he and Zélie concealed the truth by planting Margaret's body {{at the foot of a}} cliff and fabricating the story that it was Dorothea who had died. Dorothea then took her sister's place. While she fooled the servants easily, she could not fool the Ravenscrofts' dog, which could distinguish between the sisters, thus explaining why it bit her. A month later, Alistair murdered her to prevent her from injuring anyone else, making certain she held the revolver before she was killed, and then committed suicide afterwards. Desmond and Celia recognise the <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> the true events, but now knowing the facts are able to face a future together.|$|E

500|$|Big Tree, who {{presented}} witnesses to his non-involvement, {{was returned to}} the reservation and accepted pacification. He lived on in the <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> a warrior in exile. He later became a Christian and eventually, a minister in the Baptist church. The same Kiowa chief who had supervised the torture and burning of captives went about converting his own people to Christ. There were days, he would proudly recount his cruel acts against the white man, although it is faithfully recorded that he always concluded those tales with the solemn note that God had forgiven him for those [...] "hideous" [...] acts.|$|E
500|$|Prince Sadruddin died {{of cancer}} in Boston, Massachusetts, on [...] 2003, coincidentally, the same day as his elder {{half-brother}} Prince Aly Khan had died 43 years earlier. His body was conveyed to Switzerland, where members of the diplomatic corps, government officials and close friends were invited to pay their last respects at the Château de Bellerive, and sign books of condolence at various locations around the world. Ruud Lubbers, then UNHCR High Commissioner, expressed the <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> the UNHCR and the entire humanitarian community, commenting that [...] "he left an indelible print on UNHCR's history—leading the agency through some of the most challenging moments. Sadruddin's name became synonymous with UNHCR." ...|$|E
5000|$|Alfred and Jessie {{experienced}} many <b>of</b> the <b>sadnesses</b> <b>of</b> {{parents of}} this era, losing their youngest child Wilfred to infantile paralysis (polio) {{and their son}} Archie to a sniper's bullet in World War I. Their daughter Ethel was keen to {{work outside the home}} as a [...] "business girl" [...] (clerical work); however, Alfred did not approve of this plan and Ethel remained at home where (perhaps as a compromise) she acted as secretary and chauffeur to her father (who had by then lost his right hand).|$|R

500|$|Lightning Bar died in June 1960 from colitis-X, {{a disease}} of unknown origin that can kill rapidly and without warning. It {{infected}} many of Pollard's horses; of those affected only three survived. Heartbroken, Pollard sold his remaining stock and {{did not return to}} the Quarter Horse business for 15years. He said later that [...] "it was a nightmare when they were wiped out. Even now, we can still feel the <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> losing those horses." [...] Another time, Pollard remarked that [...] "Someone once said that a man deserves one good woman and one good dog in his lifetime. To that quip I would add one good horse. I certainly had one in Lightning Bar." ...|$|E
500|$|McFarland praised Kaitlin Olson's {{portrayal}} of Brenda, however, stating [...] "Olson got some laughs out {{of just how}} deep Brenda’s denial went, finding every possible excuse to blame herself and exonerate Jeff. It made her endearing and easily likeable, every bit the opposite from Olson's place in the rogue’s gallery of misanthropy on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia." [...] He ended his review by comparing it to the fellow FOX animation series The Simpsons, noting, [...] "The Simpsons managed {{to find the right}} blend with Sideshow Bob episodes, or in the aching <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> Homer and Marge's marriage, but as has been said ad infinitum, Family Guy hasn't mastered that combination {{in the same way as}} the original." [...] He graded the episode as C+.|$|E
500|$|The {{score is}} a sparse {{arrangement}} of strings and piano (with {{the addition of}} oboe and harp in one cut), intended to convey the <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> the King's muteness, and then the growing warmth of friendship between him and Logue. The minimalist approach emphasises the protagonist's struggle for control. Desplat used the repetition of a single note to represent the stickiness of the King's speech. As the film progresses, growing banks of warm strings swaddle the deepening friendship between the two leads. The music rises to a climax in the coronation scene. Hooper originally wanted to film the scene without music, but Desplat {{argued that it was}} the real climax of the story—the point when the friendship was ratified by their decision to trust each other. [...] "That is really rare", said Desplat, [...] "mostly you have love stories".|$|E

500|$|Verdi's three {{last major}} works {{continued}} to show new development in conveying drama and emotion. The first to appear, in 1874 was his Requiem, scored for operatic forces {{but by no}} means an [...] "opera in ecclesiastical dress" [...] (the words in which Hans von Bülow condemned it before even hearing it). Although in the Requiem Verdi puts to use many of the techniques he learned in opera, its musical forms and emotions are not those of the stage. Verdi's tone painting {{at the opening of the}} Requiem is vividly described by the Italian composer Ildebrando Pizzetti, [...] writing in 1941: [...] "in [...] murmured by an invisible crowd over the slow swaying of a few simple chords, you straightaway sense the fear and <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> a vast multitude before the mystery of death. In the [...] Et lux perpetuum the melody spreads it wings...before falling back on itself...you hear a sigh for consolation and eternal peace." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Habits (Stay High)" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by most critics. Harley Brown of Billboard {{wrote that the}} track is [...] "one of the most easily identifiable pop songs [...] heard in recent memory: everyone's gotten high, maybe eaten too many Twinkies, and regretted life decisions, but not everyone makes a really superb song about it". Pitchfork's Carrie Battam stated that the track's hook and production make the lyrics [...] "sound gracefully sad instead of tragic". In her review of Queen of the Clouds, Battam called it [...] "a big, sticky song, but not so big that it stuns your senses or numbs you into enjoyment". [...] Ewald Arndt of FDRMX said that [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is [...] "so fun to listen to" [...] despite its sad themes. AllMusic's Heather Phares called it [...] "the Queen of the Cloudss standout track, while Sam Lansky of Idolator stated that it [...] "has {{a little of the}} texture of Kesha's no-fucks-given party-girl pop but with the languorous <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> Robyn" [...] and that [...] "It'll get stuck in your head, which is right where it deserves to be." [...] Nick Murray labeled it as Truth Serums best track, and compared it with the music of American rapper Kendrick Lamar.|$|E
500|$|H {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} most music critics. Adam Greenberg from Allmusic reviewed the parent album Rainbow and favoured [...] "Independent" [...] and [...] "Hanabi", {{but failed to}} mention [...] "July 1st". He felt that [...] "Hanabi" [...] "focuses strongly on her vocal qualities {{as well as some}} interesting phrasing [...] ", while he concluded that the song [...] "Close to You" [...] " [...] never quite gets off the ground, especially when compared to the ending track, [...] " [...] Greenberg, who had written the extended biography of Hamasaki on the same website, had listed [...] "Hanabi" [...] as one of her career standouts. CDJournal had reviewed each track on their mini-review. For [...] "Independent", the reviewer called it a [...] "upper dance tune" [...] and felt the song sounded [...] "aggressive." [...] For the second track, the reviewer commended the song's composition and production and called it a [...] "summery, refreshing dance tune." [...] However, slight criticism was directed on the chorus that needed [...] "minor adjustment." [...] For the third track, the reviewer felt that the song expressed the <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> the end of summer through a Japanese fireworks motif, and praised her freely expressed world view.|$|E

50|$|Lee Su-jin {{was born}} in Gimcheon in 1977. He began his filmmaking career {{directing}} short films, notably Papa (2004) which received a Korean Film Archive Award at the 30th Seoul Independent Film Festival, and Enemy's Apple (2007) which won Best Film in the A City <b>of</b> <b>Sadness</b> section <b>of</b> the 7th Mise-en-scène Short Film Festival.|$|R
60|$|Regarding, then, Beauty as my province, my next {{question}} {{referred to the}} tone of its highest manifestation--and all experience has shown that this tone is one <b>of</b> <b>sadness.</b> Beauty <b>of</b> whatever kind, in its supreme development, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears. Melancholy is thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones.|$|R
500|$|In September 1939, Britain {{entered the}} Second World War, which lasted until 1945. During the war, many of London's {{children}} were evacuated {{to avoid the}} frequent aerial bombing. The suggestion by senior politician Lord Hailsham that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, [...] "The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave." [...] Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk. From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived {{for most of the}} next five years. At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments. In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities. She stated: [...] "We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our share of the danger and <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well." ...|$|E
500|$|TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars, writing [...] "Simpsons Season 26 starts {{off with a}} bang, with plenty of laughs {{and even a few}} sentimental moments". Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, commenting 'Clown in the Dumps' may not be {{considered}} a classic episode now, but after a few years when we watch it again on syndication, probably next year on FXX, it will grow in stature. It is a heartfelt episode that does bring on the laughs. The <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> the episode to me was Jackie Mason's voice, which sounds very tired. Paste gave the episode a rating of 7.1, concluding These days, The Simpsons can be hit or miss, and there was nothing to guarantee success from 'Clown in the Dumps'. However, even if the character death was perfunctory, and Rabbi Krustofski has made only a handful of appearances in over 550 episodes, it was still a funny, solid half hour of television. Nothing special—really, it was just another Krusty episode, and not the best Krusty episode. Nevertheless, the 26th season of The Simpsons has started out on somewhat of a high note. The good times keep on rolling for Matt Groening's deathless creation.|$|E
500|$|One major {{breakthrough}} was {{the composition of}} the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] by songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character. In The Daily Telegraphs words, instead of the villain envisioned by the producers, the songwriters saw Elsa as [...] "a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift." [...] Lee recalled: [...] "Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in Prospect Park and they just started talking about what would it feel like [...] Forget villain. Just what it would feel like. And this concept of letting out who she is that she's kept to herself for so long and she's alone and free, but then the <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> the fact [...] that the last moment is she's alone. It’s not a perfect thing, but it's powerful." [...] Del Vecho explained that [...] "Let It Go" [...] changed Elsa into a person [...] "ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive," [...] which in turn caused Lee to [...] "rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie. So that was when we really found the movie and who these characters were." ...|$|E
