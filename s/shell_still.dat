During this period a group of urban explorers entered to document the building's interior. , 5 Pointz was nearly fully demolished. By November 2014, most of the building was reduced to rubble, while part of the building's <b>shell</b> <b>still</b> stood.|$|E
60|$|DEARTH. A good guess, but wrong. The {{decanter}} is now but {{an empty}} <b>shell.</b> <b>Still,</b> {{how you know}} me! My engagement is with a quiet cigar in the garden.|$|E
60|$|They {{were unable}} to travel far, for all were {{exhausted}} with the sufferings they had gone through, but they kept on until they came upon a village which had been fired when the troops marched through. The walls of a little church were alone standing. It had, {{like the rest of}} the village, been burned, but the <b>shell</b> <b>still</b> remained.|$|E
5000|$|... {{during the}} rainy season in many parts of central Nigeria like Jos, the fresh bambara beans are cooked with their <b>shells</b> <b>still</b> on them. the beans are then eaten as a snack just like boiled groundnuts.|$|R
50|$|Dentalium <b>shell</b> is <b>still</b> {{used today}} in Native American and Inuit regalia.|$|R
50|$|The <b>shell</b> is <b>still</b> used in divination rituals in some African animist religions.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a <b>shell</b> <b>still</b> in," [...] he said. [...] "The man {{it belonged}} to must have dropped it in a mighty hurry. It's clear {{that there was a}} row on board her either before or after she lost her mast. That Chinaman had a bullet through his head and {{somebody}} else was hurt, though {{he got out of the}} house--the stains showed that. I wonder"--and he dropped his voice--"if we ought to search the forecastle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} over this thing {{by day and}} by night," [...] he continued, [...] "but the {{conclusion}} forces itself upon me, steadily and irresistibly, that it is my duty to descend that shaft. I have carefully considered everything, positively everything, connected with the safety of such a descent. The air in the cavity where my shell now rests is perfectly good; I have tested it. The temperature is simply warm, {{and there is no}} danger of quicksands or anything of that sort, for my <b>shell</b> <b>still</b> rests as immovable as when I first saw it below the bottom of the shaft.|$|E
60|$|The {{afternoon}} saw {{us in the}} Square at Ypres. It is {{the city}} of a dream, this modern Pompeii, destroyed, deserted and desecrated, but with a sad, proud dignity which made you involuntarily lower your voice as you passed through the ruined streets. It is a more considerable place than I had imagined, with many traces of ancient grandeur. No words can describe the absolute splintered wreck that the Huns have made of it. The effect {{of some of the}} shells has been grotesque. One boiler-plated water-tower, a thing forty or fifty feet high, was actually standing on its head like a great metal top. There is not a living soul in the place save a few pickets of soldiers, and a number of cats which become fierce and dangerous. Now and then a <b>shell</b> <b>still</b> falls, but the Huns probably know that the devastation is already complete.|$|E
5000|$|As {{allied forces}} {{prepared}} for Operation Husky (the invasion of Sicily), U-73 sank the 1,600-ton British freighter Brinkburn off Oran on 21 June 1943 and damaged the 8,300-ton Royal Navy oiler [...] on 28 June 1943. The Brinkburn exploded {{with such force}} that damaged food cans and two 75 mm <b>shells,</b> <b>still</b> in their transit boxes, were found on the U-boat's bridge.|$|R
5000|$|And we find oysters {{together}} in very large families, among which {{some may be}} seen with their <b>shells</b> <b>still</b> joined together, indicating that they were left there by the sea {{and that they were}} still living when the strait of Gibraltar was cut through. In the mountains of Parma and Piacenza multitudes of shells and corals with holes may be seen still sticking to the rocks...." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{high costs}} and low copper prices {{finished}} {{the town in}} the Depression and population of workers shrank to nothing. The mine shut down in 1935, and the town was abandoned. Some building <b>shells</b> <b>still</b> exist at Anyox but are in poor condition. Salvage operations in the 1940s removed most machinery and steel from the town, and a forest fire burned all remaining wood structures.|$|R

50|$|Egg: the egg {{is served}} with the <b>shell</b> <b>still</b> on. Peeling the egg before eating it symbolizes {{everything}} a person has to plan and do before becoming a good person.|$|E
5000|$|A rigid shell {{exoskeleton}} {{may be able}} to use {{an adjustable}} suspension harness within the shell. The rigid outer <b>shell</b> <b>still</b> imposes a maximum girth, but {{may be able to}} accommodate many smaller girths inside.|$|E
60|$|In {{the center}} of the {{building}} were long, broad tables, used for packing. A few <b>shells</b> <b>still</b> remained grouped here and there upon the boards. On either side the walls were lined with tiers of boxes bound with steel bands and ready for shipment. No person was visible in this room, but at the farther end an outer door stood ajar and just outside it a motionless form was outlined.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A ammonite of {{the genus}} Hoploscaphites from South Dakota. Much of the {{original}} nacre <b>shell</b> is <b>still</b> present.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of ammonite species feature planispiral, flat-coiled shells, but other species feature nearly straight (as in baculites) <b>shells.</b> <b>Still</b> other species' <b>shells</b> are coiled helically, superficially {{like that of}} a large gastropod (as in Turrilites and Bostrychoceras). Some species' shells are even initially uncoiled, then partially coiled, and finally straight at maturity (as in Australiceras). These partially uncoiled and totally uncoiled forms began to diversify mainly during {{the early part of the}} Cretaceous and are known as heteromorphs.|$|R
50|$|The clubroom has {{a display}} of relics drawn {{from the history of}} war {{reporting}} since the Crimean war. Cabinets show personal items, some with <b>shell</b> <b>still</b> embedded, that have stopped a bullet and saved a journalist's life. The walls of the Frontline Club display examples of war photography and artwork.|$|E
50|$|Calimero (Karimero) is an Italian/Japanese {{animated}} cartoon about a charming, but hapless anthropomorphized chicken; {{the only}} black one {{in a family of}} yellow chickens. He wears half of his egg <b>shell</b> <b>still</b> on his head. Calimero originally appeared on the Italian television show Carosello on July 14, 1962, and soon became a popular icon in Italy.|$|E

50|$|A {{pearling}} {{camp was}} established {{on the peninsula}} at Herald Bight in the 1880s {{and the remains of}} the <b>shells</b> can <b>still</b> be found along the beach.|$|R
50|$|These shelled cephalopods, {{named by}} Alpheus Hyatt in 1871, {{are part of}} the now extinct Ammonoidea, which are {{distinct}} from the <b>shelled</b> nautiloids <b>still</b> found living today.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} for habitation {{in the area}} has been found at Nara Inlet on Hook Island. Cave openings and nearby mounds, or middens, of oyster-like <b>shells</b> are <b>still</b> visible in the steep slopes of Nara Inlet.|$|R
50|$|Note that, even {{in systems}} with full kernel {{support for the}} #! magic number, some scripts lacking {{interpreter}} directives (although usually still requiring execute permission) are still runnable {{by virtue of the}} legacy script handling of the Bourne <b>shell,</b> <b>still</b> present in many of its modern descendants. Scripts are then interpreted by the user's default shell.|$|E
5000|$|Balthasar van der Ast (1593/94 [...] - [...] 7 March 1657) was a Dutch Golden Age {{painter who}} {{specialized}} in still lifes of flowers and fruit, as well as painting a number of remarkable <b>shell</b> <b>still</b> lifes; he {{is considered to be}} a pioneer in the genre of shell painting. His still lifes often contain insects and lizards.|$|E
5000|$|In {{her first}} {{election}} as supervisor from a predominantly minority district in southeastern Bakersfield, Shell defeated Richard Ybarra, a son-in-law of Hispanic labor organizer Cesar Chavez, 52.4-47.5 percent. She was unopposed in 1988. In 1992, after redistricting, her district {{became even more}} prominently Hispanic and Democratic in orientation with {{the inclusion of the}} Arvin and Lamont neighborhoods. <b>Shell</b> <b>still</b> polled 61.2 percent of the vote against Ray Gonzales and another candidate. She did not seek a fourth term in 1996, and the position went to Peter [...] "Pete" [...] Parra.|$|E
5000|$|On Christmas Day 1899, the Boers {{fired into}} Ladysmith a carrier shell without fuze, which {{contained}} a Christmas pudding, two Union Flags {{and the message}} [...] "compliments of the season". The <b>shell</b> is <b>still</b> kept in the museum at Ladysmith.|$|R
50|$|The Block Mills have {{remained}} in constant Navy occupation ever since and in consequence are not open to the public. Manufacture of blocks using these machines naturally declined over the years, production finally stopping in the 1960s, {{but some of the}} original machines, part of the transmission drives and the engine-house <b>shells</b> <b>still</b> survive in the buildings. The National Museum of Science and Industry, London, has a selection of machines, donated by the Admiralty between 1933 and 1951, and others are on display in the Dockyard Apprentice Museum at Portsmouth. Several websites claim that the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. also has machines from Portsmouth: this is a myth, according to the Institution.|$|R
50|$|As of 1 May, Gaddafi's {{forces were}} <b>still</b> <b>shelling</b> Tunisian territory, {{although}} no further casualties were reported.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the fire}} of 1929, some {{stabilization}} was performed. Metal supports were used to brace some openings, but their expansion over time has actually damaged some of the material. In addition, the two chimneys (shown in the main photo above) had their top portions removed to prevent their damaging the walls in case of collapse. As of February 2013, the <b>shell</b> <b>still</b> stands, but the National Park Service considers it {{to be in an}} [...] "emergency" [...] condition due to major cracks and deformation of the south wall, with collapse likely if no remedial action is taken.|$|E
50|$|Together the Conway {{brothers}} and Ludes founded {{what became the}} National Ticket Company, located in Shamokin since 1907. At one time {{it was the largest}} ticket manufacturing company in the United States. Their first production facility was built in 1911 at the corner of Pearl and Webster Streets. A 1942 fire gutted the plant, although the brick <b>shell</b> <b>still</b> stands. The replacement building at Pearl Street and Ticket Avenue was completed in 1950 and has served as company headquarters. The business is still owned by descendants of the Conway and Ludes families. In the 21st century National Ticket has developed international customers as well.|$|E
5000|$|Building of {{additional}} facilities for training courses {{took place in}} 1967 {{and the role of}} the Lensbury clubhouse as both a recreational and a training location was established. However financial concerns began to be expressed in the difficult economic climate of the late 1960s and early 1970s and the club's structure changed so that it became a [...] "members" [...] club to be governed by members committees and supervised by trustees. However <b>Shell</b> <b>still</b> saw the club unequivocally as a benefit for employees, and the Lensbury continued to receive a subsidy from Shell to help cover its costs. The club became, as a consequence, more arm's-length from Shell with the intention that Shell's subsidy would gradually reduce.|$|E
50|$|In May 2013 the re-release of the 620 Chair Programme was announced. Even {{though the}} new chairs are {{compatible}} with the old both in design and in measurements, the chair is built with updated materials. Notably the outer <b>shell</b> is <b>still</b> produced by the tools from 1975.|$|R
40|$|If our visible {{universe}} {{is considered a}} trapped shell in a five-dimensional hyper-universe, all matter in it may be connected by superluminal signals traveling through the fifth dimension. Events in the <b>shell</b> are <b>still</b> causal, however, the propagation of signals proceeds at different velocities depending on the fifth coordinate...|$|R
60|$|On Sundays, this visionary world came to pass. She {{heard the}} long hush, {{she knew the}} {{marriage}} of dark and light was taking place. In church, the Voice sounded, re-echoing not from this world, as if the Church itself were a <b>shell</b> that <b>still</b> spoke the language of creation.|$|R
