5|$|The brown honeyeater is {{more active}} {{in the early morning}} than at other times of the day; flying more when visiting flowers at the time when nectar is most abundant. Its body mass {{decreases}} during the night, and then increases during the day with the greatest increase occurring during the important first hour of early morning foraging. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up around half of the overnight water loss during this hour. The energy that the brown honeyeater can potentially get from nectar exceeds its requirements in all seasons except winter, when it needs to be selective in the plants that are used, to balance energy intake and expenditure. It compensates for any lessening in nectar concentration by increasing the frequency of feeding.|$|E
5|$|At the apartment, Father John and Lloyd find Linda {{has moved}} out, but they {{discover}} she had possessed a 12-year-old newspaper clipping about Father John's ordination. Father John offers Lloyd a job helping {{out at the}} church, which Lloyd accepts. Father John then returns to his church and cries, fearing he {{is too late to}} save Linda. Meanwhile, Linda goes to a bridge and is about to jump off when she encounters Gus, who offers her the rosary he received earlier from Father John. A grateful and emotional Linda hugs Gus. It is not revealed whether she commits suicide or not. In a confession to Father Ralph, Father John expresses guilt he did not absolve Linda before her confession abruptly ended. Father Ralph says that even if Linda is dead, her soul is immortal, and that Father John's penance is to absolve her now. Father John does so. The film ends with a childhood memory of young Linda at church, where a group of boys laugh at her old torn clothes until she is defended by a young John Buerlein, whose act <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a strong positive impact upon her.|$|E

As Cassandra uses a voodoo doll on Masha, trying to dissuade {{thoughts}} of selling the house, Sonia receives {{a phone call from a}} man she met at the party, requesting a date. Hesitantly, she accepts. Vanya, who is secretly writing a play inspired by Konstantin's imagined symbolist drama in The Seagull, is convinced by Nina to let her read it in front of the others. During the reading (which stars Nina as a molecule and takes place after the destruction of the earth), Spike rudely answers a text on his phone, and dismisses Vanya's suggestion of a handwritten response. Vanya reacts by launching into an impassioned rant, criticizing America's cultural regression in communication and media, while fondly and wistfully recalling the surroundings and memories of his childhood. Concluding that the intent of such progress <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> people like him feel lost and forgotten, he retreats into the kitchen in tears.|$|E

The freedoms include the ability to leave the Culture when desired, often forming new associated but separate societies with Culture ships and Minds, most notably the Zetetic Elench and the ultra-pacifist and non-interventionist Peace Faction.|$|E

Kong then approaches Tokyo and tears through the power lines, feeding off the electricity which <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him stronger. Kong then enters Tokyo and captures Fumiko, Sakurai's sister. The JSDF launches capsules full of the Faro Island berry juice in gas form which puts Kong to sleep {{and are able to}} rescue Fumiko.

25|$|Worker polyethism {{occurs in}} P. exigua colonies and {{separates}} labor based on age of individual wasps. The wasps work inside the nest when young and slowly begin foraging more as they mature. After {{the emergence of}} workers in large colonies, some foragers become specialized in delivering specific types of material to the nest. The gatherers of nest material do not build the nest themselves; instead, they pass the foraged materials onto designated builders, who proceed to distribute the materials to colony workers. This specified behavior is called “task fixation” and <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> wasps more efficient in their gathering skills. However, it also makes the fixated foragers less responsive to changes in supply and demand of materials. P. exigua colonies have {{a greater proportion of}} nonfixated wasps than fixated wasps, therefore the species as a whole can successfully adapt to resource changes.|$|E

25|$|Continuing with relationships, Ivy {{is still}} with Dixon but returns from Australia with her old {{childhood}} friend, Oscar, who <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Dixon uncomfortable. Oscar has hidden motives for revenge on Laurel, Ivy's mother, who he believes is responsible for his mother's suicide. He and Laurel have been sleeping together secretly throughout the summer, and the next step of his plan is to sleep with Ivy as well. When he succeeds, taking her virginity, both of them find out, leaving Ivy upset with her mother. Dixon breaks up with Ivy out of fear after finding out from his ex-girlfriend Sasha {{that he may be}} HIV positive, though he later tests negative (Oscar had bribed Sasha to tell Dixon this in order to make him leave Ivy so that he could make a move). Dixon and Ivy get back together, but Dixon then finds out that Oscar took Ivy's virginity on the night she and Dixon had argued and the two break up again. Naomi starts to fall for Oscar, even though Ivy has warned her of his actions. When he offers to be her boyfriend, she declines. However, unluckily for Naomi, Mr. Cannon is waiting for her in her hotel room when she returns from Adrianna's Christmas party. Mr. Cannon holds Naomi hostage and invites Silver to come over. Once she arrives, Mr. Cannon ties her up as well and tells the girls of his plan to prove his innocence and go to the bank to drain Naomi's trust fund. Silver and Naomi gang up and attack Mr. Cannon. Naomi wants to slit his throat but Silver talks her out of it and calls the police.|$|E
25|$|The old fleurs-de-lis, {{especially}} the ones {{found in our}} first kings' sceptres, have a lot less in common with ordinary lilies than the flowers called flambas , or irises, from which the name of our own fleur-de-lis may derive. What gives some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, {{is the fact that}} the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named Leie in the Flanders. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises —as many plants grow for centuries in the same places—: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of lis. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle one <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend down too when the flower blooms.|$|E

Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News wrote that while the [...] "script has issues like a pair of shoes" [...] that don't quite fit, [...] "Mitchell's production moves lickety-split" [...] and [...] "Porter ... is a force of nature as Lola." [...] But, he added, Lauper's [...] "multicolored, surprising and fun" [...] score outshines the fancy footwear and proves to be the [...] "real star of this show". Writing for The Guardian, David Cote noted that the decision to use American actors for an adaptation that maintained the Northampton setting resulted in a disconcerting inconsistency in terms of accents. [...] The Wall Street Journal gave the show a negative review, calling it [...] "an imitation heart-warming British working-class musical with a gay angle and a maudlin ending. ... Kinky Boots is its own spoiler alert, the kind of musical in which you recite the dialogue a half-beat ahead of the actors. ... sounds like ... "Cyndi: The Deservedly Forgotten Late-'80s B-Sides."

Which is why a show that <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> few false steps is so relentlessly tedious," [...] calling it [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "synthetic". Talkin' Broadway also gave the show a negative review. The Village Voice, AM New York, and NBC turned in lukewarm reviews.|$|E

[...] In January 2011, Garrett awarded Nichols a [...] "Leading Men Gold Standard" [...] and praised his portrayal that week, writing: [...] "Stephen Nichols as Tucker was all over the place this week. Initially Tucker decided to back the recording label of Devon Winters and Noah Newman. Nichols played a man who wanted to help two young men break into the music industry. However, the shocking news that Cane and Sofia have been lying to Tucker and allowing a conman to swindle Tucker’s company was destined to be revealed. Although the climax came {{at the end of the}} week, the intensity in which Stephen Nichols played the revelation was exciting to say the least. Fans know that next week Tucker McCall’s going to cause heads to roll." [...] Jae Jones of Yahoo! praised the storyline revealing Tucker as Devon's father as it gave the soap opera's matriarch, Katherine, a biracial grandson. She wrote: [...] "What <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the story line even more interesting is the fact that she has a biracial grandson.
