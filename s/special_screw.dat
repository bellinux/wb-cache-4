We also present novel methods for the determination of the principal screws for four-, five-systems which do not require the explicit computation of the reciprocal systems. Principal screws of the systems of different orders are identified from one uniform criterion, namely that the pitches of the principal screws are the extreme values of the pitch.

In most cases, a closing wedge osteotomy was performed using the Fragment Fixation System (FFS; Orthofix®) for temporary fixation and a low profile plate (Depuy Synthes® or Medartis®) for definitive fixation. Great care was taken not to damage the distal growth plate of the radius (Fig.  3). From the preoperative planning, four fixator pins (typically 80  mm length with 20  mm thread length (conical blunt-tipped and hydroxyapatite coated, Orthofix®) were placed into the distal ulna through stab incisions. Using <b>special</b> <b>screw</b> and drill guides and with predrilling and cooling, different angles of pin placement with regard to rotation and abduction allowed for pre-emptive correction of the deformity of the ulna (Fig.  4). Meticulous care was taken for good purchase and bicortical penetration of all pins, which was difficult due to previous or simultaneous resection of osteochondromas in the area. The osteotomy was performed using a sharp drill and a chisel whilst preserving the periosteum. The monolateral lengthening fixator was mounted, the acute re-alignment of the ulna was documented, and a test distraction performed (Fig.  3).

40|$|Supercritical fluid {{technology}} is a well documented and emergent technology used in many industries today {{for the formation of}} micro- and nano- particles. The use of supercritical fluids allows synthesis of various types of particles since their properties can be varied with temperature or pressure, which sequentially can control the physical and chemical properties of the particles produced. Several different processes designed to generate powders and composites using supercritical fluids have been proposed in the past 20 years which can be used to synthesize materials with high performance specifications and unique functionality. In this research work, an extrusion micronization process using supercritical fluid has been proposed. This powder production technique could be a promising alternative to conventional techniques in terms of improvement in product quality as it provides a better control over particle size, morphology and particle size distribution, without degradation or contamination of the product. In addition, as extrusion is globally used for polymer production and processing, particle production by extrusion will allow production and processing in a single process step, eliminating the need for secondary particle production methods. 	The micronization process designed and described in this thesis involves a twin screw extruder equipped with a converging die and a high resistance spraying nozzle for particle production. A special CO 2 injection device and polymer collection chamber was designed for CO 2 supply and powder collection. To ensure complete dissolution of CO 2 into the polymer matrix, stable injection of CO 2, pressure generation and constant spray of micronized polymer particles, a <b>special</b> <b>screw</b> configuration was carefully designed for the extrusion process. The feasibility and the performance of this process have been demonstrated by experimental studies performed with low molecular weight polyethylene wax. Carbon dioxide at supercritical conditions was used as a solvent for processing the polymer. 	The generated polyethylene particles from the polyethylene wax/carbon dioxide solution system were analyzed and studied using an optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, capillary rheometer and differential scanning calorimeter. A detailed study on the effects of the processing parameters, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate and supercritical fluid on properties of polyethylene particle produced was carried out. The particle size data collected using an optical microscope indicate a significant impact of temperature and CO 2 content on particle size. The obtained size data were utilized to generate particle size distribution plots and studied to analyze the effect of the processing variables. It was found that particle size distribution is affected by processing temperature and CO 2 content. Studies of the SEM images reveal that the morphology of particles can be controlled by varying processing variables like temperature, polymer feed rate and CO 2 content. 	The particles generated during this study indicate that particle production in an extrusion process using supercritical carbon dioxide is achievable and appears to be a promising alternative to conventional polymer particle production methods such as grinding, milling and other supercritical fluid-based precipitation methods. To validate and generalize the applicability of this process, micronization of other polymeric material should be performed. Commercialization of this technology will further require predictability and consistency of the characteristics of the product, for which a detailed understanding of the influence of all relevant process variables is necessary. In addition, development of theoretical models will further assist in the scale-up and commercialization of this supercritical fluid assisted micronization technology in the near future...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a uniﬁed {{framework for the}} analysis of instantaneous kinematics and statics of spatial manipulators. The proposed formulation covers the entire range of kinematic behavior, with kinematic singularity and isotropy appearing as special cases. An analogous treatment of statics is also presented. It is established that the formulations presented are capable of generating exact solutions in closed form for several interesting problems in manipulator analysis. Several such results have been obtained via extensive usage of symbolic computation tools developed for this purpose. The proposed approach is applicable to manipulators of diﬀerent architectures. However, {{the focus is on the}} parallel and hybrid manipulators, as their analysis presents more challenges than their serial counterparts. The theory of screws has been adopted as the basis of the formulation. Instantaneous kinematics and statics are studied in terms of the principal bases of the space of twists, se(3), and the space of wrenches, se* (3), respectively. A dual number parameterisation of the motion space is adopted to make the formulation compact and dimensionally consistent. The properties of the dual combination obviate the need for an explicit scaling between the linear and angular velocities or the forces and moments. Hence the results obtained from the formulation are purely geometrical. The analysis of the twists is performed via the dual velocity Jacobian matrix. The principal basis of se(3) is obtained from the eigenproblem of a symmetrical dual matrix associated with the Jacobian. The notion of a dual eigenproblem is introduced in this context. Solutions are provided for the general case, as well as a few special cases. The computations involve the solution of at most a cubic equation for any arbitrary degree-of-freedom of rigid-body motion, and closed form results are therefore ensured. The results of the eigen-analysis lead to a decoupling of the rotational and the pure translational components of a rigid-body motion. This is termed as the partitioning of degrees-of-freedom. They also motivate an interesting classiﬁcation of the manipulators based on the instantaneous partition of its degrees-of-freedom. This notion is further extended to analyse the eﬀects of a singularity on the motion characteristics of a manipulator. Due to the duality of se(3) and se*(3), the formulation of statics is completely analogous, and involves, in essence, only the substitution of the dual wrench-transformation matrix for the dual Jacobian. A similar partitioning of the wrench system is introduced based on the eigen-decomposition in the context of statics. It is shown that the principal screws associated with either a system of twists or wrenches can be obtained from a generalised eigenproblem of two symmetric real matrices arising out of the symmetric dual matrix mentioned above. The general 2 -and 3 -screw systems are analysed in closed form via the generalised characteristic polynomial. Several <b>special</b> <b>screw</b> systems are described in terms of algebraic equations in terms of the coefﬁcients of this polynomial. Principal bases for 4 -and 5 -systems are obtained in a novel fashion without deriving their reciprocal systems explicitly. Using the same approach based on the analysis of the characteristic polynomial, compact algebraic conditions for singularity and isotropy are derived as the special cases of a single formulation. The above formulations establish the existence of exact closed-form results. However, to implement them symbolically for a real application problem, capabilities in existing computer algebra systems do not suﬃce in general. Therefore simpliﬁcation and computational algorithms are developed for dealing with large expressions with algebraic and trigonometric terms typically appearing in kinematics and statics. Three canonical forms of such expressions and the corresponding simpliﬁcation schemes are presented. The theoretical developments are illustrated with examples of serial, parallel and hybrid manipulators throughout the thesis. However, the most important applications of these are in the kinematic and static analysis of a semi-regular Stewart platform manipulator (in which the top and bottom platforms are semi-regular hexagons). Using the degeneracy of the wrench transformation matrix as the singularity criterion, the singularity manifold of the manipulator is obtained via extensive application of the symbolic simpliﬁcation algorithms. The constant-orientation singularity manifold is derived in a compact closed form, and a complete geometric characterisation and explicit parameterisation of the same are presented. The constant-position singularity manifold is also obtained in closed form. On the other hand, families of conﬁgurations of the manipulator for combined kinematic or static isotropy for a given architecture are derived in closed form. Also, architectural designs are obtained for the manipulator such that it exhibits combined kinematic or static isotropy at a given conﬁguration...|$|E
