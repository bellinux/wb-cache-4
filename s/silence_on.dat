5|$|After {{filming of}} The Wolf of Wall Street {{concluded}} in January 2013, Scorsese refused {{to follow it}} up with any film other than <b>Silence.</b> <b>On</b> April 19, 2013, {{it was announced that}} Scorsese would begin production on Silence in 2014, after a reputed 23-year wait. Irwin Winkler was announced as a producer the same day, as were Randall Emmett and George Furla, who would finance the production through their company Emmett/Furla Films. Paul Breuls' Corsan Films was also reportedly funding the project. Additionally, it was announced that the film would be shot in Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, many people assumed Jack Fingleton, the only full-time journalist on either team, was responsible. This belief {{may have affected}} {{the course of his}} subsequent career. Fingleton later wrote that Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman and the primary target of Bodyline, was the person who disclosed the story. Bradman always denied this, and continued to blame Fingleton; animosity between the pair continued {{for the rest of their}} lives. Woodfull's earlier public <b>silence</b> <b>on</b> the tactics had been interpreted as approval; the leak was significant in persuading the Australian public that Bodyline was unacceptable.|$|E
40|$|REII is a Schizosaccharomyces pombe {{repression}} element {{located at}} the centromere-proximal end of the mat silent domain. Here we show that inversion of REII enhances <b>silencing</b> <b>on</b> its centromere-proximal side while suppressing <b>silencing</b> <b>on</b> its centromere-distal side. Transplacement of REII to a position 2. 5 kb from its native locus extends the region of stringent repression to the new REII site. These results suggest that REII defines a mat silent domain boundary by acting preferentially toward its centromere-distal side. To investigate cooperation between REII and a K-region sequence that shares homology with the centromeric dg dh repeats (cen 2 homology), we targeted combinations of these elements to an ectopic site and monitored expression of an adjacent reporter gene. Centromeric dh-like sequences conferred low-level <b>silencing</b> <b>on</b> the adjacent reporter gene, and REII, which did not display <b>silencing</b> activity <b>on</b> its own, enhanced cen 2 homology-mediated silencing. Cooperation was also apparent at the mat locus, where deletion of REII impaired repression stability. We propose that REII and the cen 2 homology play different yet complementary roles in silencing establishment and inheritance at the mat locus...|$|R

5|$|The {{pre-production}} {{phase of}} the filmmaking for Silence went through a cycle of over two decades of set-backs and reassessments.

5|$|Ingram's refusal allowed Rossy {{to take up}} the bishopric. He was consecrated by 16 July 1380.

5|$|While Vali's {{acquisition}} of Ruma— elder brother taking his younger sister-in-law as wife—is universally condemned; however as in Tara's case, elder brother's widow marrying her younger brother-in-law {{seems to be}} a social norm. Ramashraya Sharma considers that Rama's <b>silence</b> <b>on</b> marriage of Tara and Sugriva does not signal non-acceptance of the act, but rather that he is not concerned with the issue of the sexual relations of the loose charactered vanaras, in which Tara and Ruma exchange hands between the brothers. Ramayana mentions that Sugriva indulges in sexual pleasures of women, including Ruma and Tara, who he coveted. In Ramayana however, Angada criticizes Sugriva for his lustful marriage to his elder sister-in-law Tara, who is like a mother to him. Though a political marriage, Tara serves Sugriva loyally.|$|E
5|$|As Secretary Upshur {{accelerated}} the secret treaty discussions, Mexican diplomats learned that US-Texas talks were taking place. Mexican {{minister to the}} U.S. Juan Almonte confronted Upshur with these reports, warning him that if Congress sanctioned a treaty of annexation, Mexico would break diplomatic ties and immediately declare war. Secretary Upshur evaded and dismissed the charges, and pressed forward with the negotiations. In tandem with moving forward with Texas diplomats, Upshur was secretly lobbying US Senators to support annexation, providing lawmakers with persuasive arguments linking Texas acquisition to national security and domestic peace. By early 1844, Upshur was able to assure Texas officials that 40 of the 52 members of the Senate were pledged to ratify the Tyler-Texas treaty, more than the two-thirds majority required for passage. Tyler, in his annual address to Congress in December 1843, maintained his <b>silence</b> <b>on</b> the secret treaty, {{so as not to}} damage relations with the wary Texas diplomats. Throughout, Tyler did his utmost to keep the negotiations secret, making no public reference to his administration's single-minded quest for Texas.|$|E

5|$|This tactic did {{not prove}} successful: pro-Nazi {{propaganda}} and protests were rampant, {{even among the}} Lithuanian population, and the local government was powerless to prevent them. The Nazis physically harassed Lithuanian organizations. On 1 November 1938 Lithuania was pressured into lifting martial law and press censorship. During the December elections to the Klaipėda Parliament, pro-German parties received 87% of votes (25 seats out of 29) in the Klaipėda territory. Dr. Ernst Neumann, the chief defendant in the 1934 trials, {{was released from prison}} in February 1938 and became the leader of Klaipėda's pro-German movement. In December he was received by Adolf Hitler, who assured him that the Klaipėda issue would be resolved by March or April 1939. Neumann and other Nazi activists claimed the right of self-determination for the region and demanded that Lithuania open negotiations over the political status of Klaipėda. The parliament was expected to vote for a return to Germany when it convened on 25 March 1939. Germany's official channels maintained <b>silence</b> <b>on</b> the issue. Germany hoped that Lithuania would voluntarily give up the troubled region, and a public stance could have disturbed the sensitive discussions it was then engaged in with Poland over an anti-Communist alliance against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Trevor is {{depicted}} as a sociopath in Grand Theft Auto V. He is relentless and easily kills without remorse. However, he is honest about everything and rarely shows hypocrisy, which he often points out in others. He appears to be very insecure about {{having grown up in}} Canada, and takes offence to people mocking his accent. Despite his sociopathic actions, Trevor is very emotional; he seems to care about people very close to him, and he can be truly loyal to them. These people include his mother, Ashley Butler, Patricia Madrazo, Maude, Michael De Santa and his children Tracey and Jimmy, Lamar Davis, Ron, Lester, Wade and Franklin Clinton. Nevertheless, the other characters regard Trevor as dangerously unstable; during the prologue, Michael leads Trevor into a trap where he is supposed to be shot and killed, and later implores Franklin to plead insanity if he is ever arrested with Trevor. It is implied that the knowledge and extent of Trevor's crimes, the belief that Trevor's depravity escalated without anyone to keep him in check and his <b>silence</b> <b>on</b> the matter all weigh heavily on Michael's conscience.|$|E
5|$|Zosimus {{provides}} the lengthiest {{account of the}} games (at Historia Nova 2.1–7), but does not mention Philip. The games had a starring role in Zosimus' scheme of Roman history. To him, the fortune of the empire was intimately related {{to the practice of}} the traditional civic rites. Any emperor who revived or supported those rites—Augustus, Claudius, Domitian, Septimius Severus—earns Zosimus' credit, while the emperor who ended them, Constantine I, earns his condemnation. All the misfortune of the 4th century can be directly attributed to Constantine's discontinuation of the old rites. In this context, Shahîd argues, Zosimus' <b>silence</b> <b>on</b> Philip's Christianity and Philip's involvement in the games makes sense. First, it would have given lie to his thesis on that the practice of the traditional rites guaranteed the fortunes of empire, since the period following the games was hardly a happy one (and this argument remains valid even if both Philip's Christianity and Zosimus' awareness of the tradition is denied). And second, it would have dulled his attack on Constantine by disentangling the potent alignment between imperial disaster, Christianity, and the traditional cult. The last emperor to celebrate the games was also the first emperor to embrace Christianity. The incongruity of this fact proved too much for the historian to handle, so he ignored it.|$|E

5|$|The band {{existed for}} almost a decade before {{mainstream}} success. The members met and played in Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School under the name Pezz and remained underground in Toronto's indie music scene until 2001. The band renamed itself Billy Talent after running into legal trouble with the old name. It was then that Kowalewicz's connection with an employee of Warner Music Canada's A department landed the band a record deal and launched them into mainstream success. Since then, Billy Talent has made three multi-platinum records in Canada, and continues to expand their success overseas, this included touring for 20 months supporting their second album. They released their third album, entitled Billy Talent III, on July 14, 2009, and their fourth album, entitled Dead <b>Silence,</b> <b>on</b> September 4, 2012. Dead Silence was followed up by a full UK tour over the course of October and November 2012. To commemorate the longevity since the release of their first studio album, the band has released a greatest hits album entitled Hits on November 4, 2014. The band regrouped and began to prepare material for its fifth studio album. Just prior to entering the studio, drummer Aaron Solowoniuk made the difficult decision to sit out the recording sessions while he continued his longstanding battle with multiple sclerosis. Fellow Canadian Jordan Hastings was quickly recruited to play as Solowoniuk's studio stand-in, and in early 2016 the group completed work on Afraid of Heights, which was released that July.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{focused on}} three role-playing games created for Nintendo's Wii home video game console {{during the last}} years of its life: Xenoblade Chronicles, The Last Story and Pandora's Tower. Xenoblade Chronicles, developed by Monolith Soft, was an entry in the Xeno series, initially announced as an original project dubbed Monado: Beginning of the World. It was announced under this title at the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), but its title was changed to honor earlier Xeno titles created by the game's writer Tetsuya Takahashi. The Last Story was developed by Mistwalker, a company created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and intended to be a game that ran contrary to typical elements of the genre based on feedback from the company's previous titles Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey. Pandora's Tower was developed by Ganbarion, who had previously worked primarily on licensed titles and pitched the concept to Nintendo after favorably impressing them with their work on Jump Ultimate Stars. Despite hopes from fans and journalists that the titles would be released overseas, Nintendo gave no comment on the matter. The only explanation for the lack of localization was related to The Last Story: Nintendo stated that due to their work on Kirby's Epic Yarn and titles for the new Nintendo 3DS, The Last Story was too much effort. Nintendo of Europe did want to feature Xenoblade Chronicles at E3 2011, but Nintendo's American branch prevented it without explanation. In response to this and continued <b>silence</b> <b>on</b> both The Last Story and Pandora's Tower, Operation Rainfall was born.|$|E

Th is current study was de-signed to investigate the impact of p <b>silencing</b> <b>on</b> the sensitivity of Human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG cells to cisplatin. HepG/CDDP/. and HepG/CDDP/. cells were induced by culture with increased doses of cisplatin and their sensitivities to cis-Di-amine dichloroplatinum (CDDP) were determined by -(,-Dimethylthiazol [...] yl) -,-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Th e impacts of p <b>silencing</b> <b>on</b> the cell cycling and P-gp expression were characterized by fl ow cytometry, RT-PCR and Western blot assays, respectively. Knockdown of p expression dramatically reduced the relative levels of p expression {{and the frequency of}} phase G, promoting cell cycling. On the other hand, knockdown of p expression signifi cantly up-regulated the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in HepG/CDDP/. cells, associated with the increased resistance of HepG cells to CDDP in vitro. In conclusion, the p may be a critical regulator of the development of CDDP resistance in HepG cells...|$|R

40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{silencers}} {{flanking the}} HML and HMR loci consist of various combinations of binding sites for Abf 1 p, Rap 1 p, and the origin recognition complex (ORC) that serve to recruit the Sir silencing complex, thereby initiating {{the establishment of}} transcriptionally silent chromatin. There have been seemingly conflicting reports concerning whether silencers function in an orientation-dependent or -independent manner, and what determines the directionality of a silencer has not been explored. We demonstrate that chromatin {{plays a key role}} in determining the potency and directionality of silencers. We show that nucleosomes are asymmetrically distributed around the HML-I or HMR-E silencer so that a nucleosome is positioned close to the Abf 1 p side but not the ORC side of the silencer. This coincides with preferential association of Sir proteins and transcriptional <b>silencing</b> <b>on</b> the Abf 1 p side of the silencer. Elimination of the asymmetry in nucleosome positioning at a silencer leads to comparable <b>silencing</b> <b>on</b> both sides. Asymmetric nucleosome positioning in the immediate vicinity of a silencer is independent of its orientation and genomic context, indicating that it is the inherent property of the silencer. Moreover, it is also independent of the Sir complex and thus precedes the formation of silent chromatin. Finally, we demonstrate that asymmetric positioning of nucleosomes and directional silencing by a silencer depend on ORC and Abf 1 p. We conclude that the HML-I and HMR-E silencers promote asymmetric positioning of nucleosomes, leading to unequal potentials of transcriptional <b>silencing</b> <b>on</b> their sides and, hence, directional silencing...|$|R
