25|$|<b>Syria</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} Southwestern Asia, {{north of the}} Arabian Peninsula, at {{the eastern end of}} the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered by Turkey to the north, Lebanon and Israel to the west and southwest, Iraq to the east, and Jordan to the south. It {{consists}} of mountain ranges in the west and a steppe area inland. In the east is the Syrian Desert and in the south is the Jabal al-Druze Range. The former is bisected by the Euphrates valley. A dam built in 1973 on the Euphrates created a reservoir named Lake Assad, the largest lake in Syria. The highest point in <b>Syria</b> <b>is</b> Mount Hermon (2,814 m; 9,232ft) on the Lebanese border. Between the humid Mediterranean coast and the arid desert regions lies a semiarid steppe zone extending across three-quarters of the country, which receives hot, dry winds blowing across the desert. <b>Syria</b> <b>is</b> extensively depleted, with 28 percent of the land arable, 4 percent dedicated to permanent crops, 46 percent utilized as meadows and pastures, and only 3 percent forest and woodland.|$|E

25|$|According to a 2009 {{article by}} US {{political}} scientist Jessica Barnes, while water scarcity in <b>Syria</b> <b>is</b> usually {{presented as a}} result of population growth, it actually is a consequence of the ruling Ba'ath party’s promotion of water-intensive agriculture. This support for the agricultural sector is motivated in part by a desire for food self-sufficiency and growth through an expansion in irrigated agriculture. It is also linked to the rural roots of the Ba'ath party and the influential Peasants Union. Although much of the ruling class in <b>Syria</b> <b>is</b> now urban, the symbolic links between the party and the rural sector continue. This political context may explain why the government is reluctant to take drastic steps to reduce the pumping of groundwater from private wells for irrigation in the Ghouta near Damascus.|$|E

25|$|<b>Syria</b> <b>is</b> {{approximately}} three quarters Sunni, but its government is predominantly Alawite, a Shia sect {{that makes up}} less than 15% of the population. Under Hafez al-Assad, Alawites dominated the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, a secular Arab nationalist party which had ruled Syria under {{a state of emergency}} from 1963 to 2011. Alawites are often considered a form of Shia Islam, that differs somewhat from the larger Twelver Shia sect.|$|E
25|$|The factual {{history of}} smoking in <b>Syria</b> <b>is</b> uncertain.

25|$|In {{some parts}} of Syria, Lebanon and other Eastern Mediterranean countries, {{drinking}} mate is common.

Although <b>Syria</b> <b>is</b> not part of any Arab state union, the flag of the United Arab Republic was readopted to show Syria's commitment to Arab unity. The usage of the flag has become disputed because it is often associated with the Ba'ath Party and has come to represent parties loyal to Assad's government in the Syrian civil war.|$|E
