These materials are prepared by combining alumina, phosphoric acid, and sodium hydroxide.|$|R
5000|$|As a food additive, {{it has the}} E number E541. [...] Basic <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphates</b> {{are also}} known, e.g., Na15Al3(PO4)8. These species are useful in cheese making.|$|R
25|$|Many {{forms of}} baking powder contain sodium {{bicarbonate}} combined with calcium acid <b>phosphate,</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphate</b> or cream of tartar. Baking soda is alkaline; the acid used in baking powder avoids a metallic taste when the chemical change during baking creates sodium carbonate.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>acidic</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphates</b> {{are used}} as acids for baking powders for the {{chemical}} leavening of baked goods. Upon heating, SAlP combines with the baking soda to give carbon dioxide. Most of its action occurs at baking temperatures, rather than when the dough or batter is mixed at room temperature. SAlPs are advantageous because they impart a neutral flavor.|$|R
50|$|Wardite is a hydrous <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{hydroxide}} mineral with formula: NaAl3(PO4)2(OH)4·2(H2O). Wardite is {{of interest}} for its rare crystallography. It crystallizes in the tetragonal trapezohedral class {{and is one of}} only a few minerals in that class. Wardite forms vitreous green to bluish green to white to colorless crystals, masses, and fibrous encrustations. It has a Mohs hardness of 5 and a specific gravity of 2.81-2.87.|$|R
50|$|Since {{chemical}} {{expertise is}} required to create a functional chemical leaven without producing off-flavors from the chemical precursors involved, such substances are often mixed into premeasured combinations for maximum results. These are generally referred to as baking powders. Sour milk and carbonates {{were used in the}} 1800s. The breakthrough in chemical leavening agents occurred in the 1930s with the introduction of monocalcium phosphates (Ca(H2PO4)2). Other leavening agents developed include <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> sulfate (NaAl(SO4)2·12H2O), disodium pyrophosphate (Na2H2P2O7), and <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphates</b> (NaH14Al3(PO4)8·4H2O and Na3H15Al2(PO4)8). These compounds combine with sodium bicarbonate to give carbon dioxide in a predictable manner.|$|R
50|$|Amblygonite is a fluorophosphate mineral, (Li,Na)AlPO4(F,OH), {{composed}} of lithium, <b>sodium,</b> <b>aluminium,</b> <b>phosphate,</b> fluoride and hydroxide. The mineral occurs in pegmatite deposits and is easily mistaken for albite and other feldspars. Its density, cleavage and flame test for lithium are diagnostic. Amblygonite forms a series with montebrasite, the low fluorine endmember. Geologic occurrence is in granite pegmatites, high-temperature tin veins, and greisens. Amblygonite occurs with spodumene, apatite, lepidolite, tourmaline, and other lithium-bearing minerals in pegmatite veins. It contains about 10% lithium, {{and has been}} utilized {{as a source of}} lithium. The chief commercial sources have historically been the deposits of California and France.|$|R

5000|$|Brazilianite, NaAl3(PO4)2(OH)4 is a hydrous <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{that forms}} through the metasomantic {{alteration}} of amblygonite-montebrasite. [...] Amblygonite, LiAlPO4F {{in combination with}} quartz goes through an OH-F exchange to make montebrasite, LiAlPO4{F,OH} at temperatures greater than 480 °C. [...] Natromontebrasite, NaAl(PO4)(OH), is formed when montebrasite does though Li-leaching process {{and there is a}} Na cation exchange at temperatures less than 450 °C. [...] Brazilianite concludes this process by forming as natromontebrasite combines with fluorapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F. [...] Due to its formation caused by the amblygonite-montebrasite alteration and the presence of tourmaline in the environment where brazilianite forms, different elements are present in the mineral such as P, Al, Fe, Mn, Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Na, K, F, and Cl. [...] There are many substitution possibilities in the brazilianite formula. [...] Besides sodium, being replaced by any other element, iron can replace aluminium, and vanadates or arsenates can replace the phosphates.|$|R

40|$|The {{sorption}} of <b>phosphate</b> on amorphous <b>aluminium</b> hydroxides {{was investigated}} using Al- 27 and P- 31 solid-state magic-angle spinning {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (MAS NMR) spectroscopy, following the effect of different exposures to soluble phosphate. The spectra obtained were compared with the spectrum of amorphous <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> <b>Aluminium</b> in the unreacted hydroxide had a 100 % octahedral co-ordination. When dried at 200 -degrees-C and exposed to soluble phosphate, very little (maximum 0. 1 %) amorphous aluminium hydroxide transformed to a tetrahedral co-ordination (Al bound by oxygen bridges to four P atoms), even after 120 d. The tetrahedral co-ordination exists in <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphate</b> gel, although most of its Al atoms exhibit an octahedral co-ordination. For the aluminium hydroxide dried at 200 -degrees-C, no formation of <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphate</b> in which <b>aluminium</b> is in octahedral co-ordination could be detected, not even when the aluminium hydroxide was exposed to a phosphate solution for 120 d. We concluded that the formation of <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphate</b> is restricted {{to the surface of}} the hydroxide. Most of the phosphate which is bound to the aluminium oxide however may not have formed a 'bulk solid' <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> but is adsorbed on the internal and external surface of the oxide. The same amorphous aluminium hydroxide, dried at 70 -degrees-C instead of 200 -degrees-C, is converted much more rapidly to <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphate</b> when exposed to soluble phosphate. We propose a P-induced weathering mechanism to describe P sorption on amorphous aluminium hydroxides at high P concentrations. In addition to NMR, phosphate adsorption experiments conducted on aluminium hydroxides dried at different temperatures produced evidence that the porosity of the aluminium hydroxide aggregated particles can also be a factor controlling the rate of phosphate uptake from solution, if the aggregate is stable (is not resuspended) in solution. status: publishe...|$|R
