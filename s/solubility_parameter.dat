Rational substitutions can also be made for [...] "good" [...] solvents (effective at dissolving the solute) that are [...] "bad" [...] (expensive or hazardous to health or the environment). The following table shows that the intuitions from [...] "non-polar", [...] "polar aprotic" [...] and [...] "polar protic" [...] are put numerically – the [...] "polar" [...] molecules have higher levels of δP and the protic solvents have higher levels of δH. Because numerical values are used, comparisons can be made rationally by comparing numbers. For example, acetonitrile is much more polar than acetone but exhibits slightly less hydrogen bonding.|$|E

50|$|After {{a degree}} (1961, Louisville) and Masters (1962, Wisconsin) in {{chemical}} engineering, Hansen worked for his Ph.D. at the Technical University of Denmark, initially {{on the problems}} of solvent retention in polymers, starting his lifetime interest in diffusion science. However, the problems of predicting the compatibility of solvents with polymers took over, leading him to overcome the problems of the then-popular Hildebrand <b>solubility</b> <b>parameter</b> by dividing Hildebrand's single parameter into three components: dispersion, polar and hydrogen bonding. His 1967 doctoral thesis (Dr. techn.) provided the basis for what came to be called Hansen solubility parameters, or HSPs. In addition to providing a theoretical framework, the thesis provided the first working set of HSP values for common solvents and for a range of commercial polymers, making it of immediate practical use to academia and industry.|$|E
50|$|Plasticizers make it {{possible}} to achieve improved compound processing characteristics, while also providing flexibility in the end-use product. Ester plasticizers are selected based upon cost-performance evaluation. The rubber compounder must evaluate ester plasticizers for compatibility, processibility, permanence and other performance properties. The wide variety of ester chemistries that are in production include sebacates, adipates, terephthalates, dibenzoates, gluterates, phthalates, azelates, and other specialty blends. This broad product line provides an array of performance benefits required for the many elastomer applications such as tubing and hose products, flooring, wall-coverings, seals and gaskets, belts, wire and cable, and print rolls. Low to high polarity esters provide utility {{in a wide range of}} elastomers including nitrile, polychloroprene, EPDM, chlorinated polyethylene, and epichlorohydrin. Plasticizer-elastomer interaction is governed by many factors such as <b>solubility</b> <b>parameter,</b> molecular weight, and chemical structure.

50|$|Solid PDMS samples (whether surface {{oxidized}} or not) {{will not}} allow aqueous solvents to infiltrate and swell the material.

However most organic solvents will diffuse into the material and cause it to swell, making them incompatible with PDMS devices. Despite this, some organic solvents lead to sufficiently small swelling that they can be used with PDMS, for instance within the channels of PDMS microfluidic devices. The swelling ratio is roughly inversely related to the <b>solubility</b> <b>parameter</b> of the solvent. Diisopropylamine swells PDMS to the greatest extent; solvents such as chloroform, ether, and THF swell the material to a large extent. Solvents such as acetone, 1-propanol, and pyridine swell the material to a small extent. Alcohols and polar solvents such as methanol, glycerol and water do not swell the material appreciably.|$|E
5000|$|In the US, {{dimethyl}} carbonate was exempted under {{the definition of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by the U.S. EPA in 2009. [...] Due to its classification as VOC exempt, {{dimethyl carbonate}} has grown in popularity and applications {{as a replacement for}} methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), tert-butyl acetate, and parachlorobenzotrifluoride. Dimethyl carbonate has an ester- or alcohol-like odor, which is more favorable to users than most hydrocarbon solvents it replaces. Dimethyl carbonate has an evaporation rate of 3.22 (butyl acetate = 1.0), which slightly slower than MEK (3.8) and ethyl acetate (4.1), and faster than toluene (2.0) and isopropanol (1.7). Dimethyl carbonate has solubility profile similar to common glycol ethers, meaning dimethyl carbonate can dissolve most common coating resins except perhaps rubber based resins. Hildebrand <b>solubility</b> <b>parameter</b> is 20.3 Mpa and Hansen solubility parameters are: dispersion = 15.5, polar = 3.9, H bonding = 9.7. [...] Dimethyl carbonate is partially soluble in water up to 13%, however it is hydrolyzed in water-based systems over time to methanol and CO2 unless properly buffered.Dimethyl carbonate can freeze at same temperatures as water, it can be thawed out with no loss of properties to itself or coatings based on dimethyl carbonate.|$|E

40|$|Hildebrand and Hansen <b>solubility</b> <b>parameters</b> are {{commonly}} used to identify suitable solvents for the dispersion or dissolution {{of a range of}} solutes, from small molecules to graphene. This practice is based on a number of equations which predict the enthalpy of mixing to be minimized when the <b>solubility</b> <b>parameters</b> of solvent and solute match. However, such equations have only been rigorously derived for mixtures of small molecules which interact only via dispersive forces. Here we derive a general expression for the enthalpy of mixing in terms of the dimensionality of the solute where small molecules are considered zero dimensional, materials such as polymers or nanotubes are one-dimensional and platelets such as graphene are two-dimensional. We explicitly include contributions due to dispersive, dipole-dipole and dipole-induced dipole interactions. We find equations very similar to those of Hildebrand and Hansen so long as the <b>solubility</b> <b>parameters</b> of the solute are defined in a manner which reflects their dimensionality. In addition, the equations for 1 D and 2 D systems are equivalent to known expressions for the enthalpy of mixing of rods and platelets respectively as a function of surface energy.

The {{thermodynamics}} {{and solid}} state properties of components and their interactions in a formulation for polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PLN) were characterized for screening lead lipid carriers and rational design of PLN. Methods. Verapamil HCl (VRP) {{was chosen as}} a model drug and dextran sulfate sodium (DS) as a counter-ionic polymer. <b>Solubility</b> <b>parameters</b> of VRP, VRP-DS complex, and various lipids were calculated and partition of VRP and VRP-DS in lipids was determined. Thermodynamics of VRP binding to DS was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The solid state properties of individual components and their interactions were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Results. Dodecanoic acid (DA) was identified as the best lipid carrier among all lipids tested based on the <b>solubility</b> <b>parameters</b> and partition coefficients. VRP-DS complexation was a thermodynamically favorable process. Maximum binding capacity of DS and the highest drug loading capacity of DA were obtained at an equal ionic molar ratio of DS to VRP. In the PLN formulation, DA remained its crystal structure but had a slightly lower melting point, while VRP-DS complex was in an amorphous form. Conclusions. Drug loading efficiency and capacity of a lipid matrix depend on the VRP-DS binding and the interactions of the complex with the lipid. A combined analysis of <b>solubility</b> <b>parameters</b> and partition coefficients is useful for screening lipid candidates for PLN preparation.
