5|$|Development {{began in}} 1970, when NASA {{released}} {{a request for}} proposal for 'Phase B' main engine concept studies, requiring development of a throttleable, <b>staged</b> <b>combustion,</b> de Laval-type engine. The request {{was based on the}} then-current design of the Space Shuttle which featured two reusable stages, the orbiter and a manned fly-back booster, and required one engine which would be able to power both vehicles via two different nozzles (12 booster engines with 550,000lbf sea level thrust each and 3 orbiter engines with 632,000lbf vacuum thrust each). Rocketdyne, P and Aerojet General were selected to receive funding although, given P's already-advanced development (demonstrating a working 350,000lbf concept engine during the year) and Aerojet General's prior experience in developing the 1,500,000lbf M-1 engine, Rocketdyne was forced to put a large amount of private money into the design process to allow the company to catch up to its competitors.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{his most}} {{significant}} engineering failure, {{as noted by}} division chief Yuri Demyanko, was his insistence that hydrogen was unsuitable {{for use as a}} rocket fuel. As a result, the Soviet space program was still discussing the use of hydrogen-fueled engines while the Americans were assembling the Saturn V launcher. Also, Glushko's design bureau consistently failed at building a rocket engine powered by LOX/Kerosene with a large combustion chamber to rival the American F1 used on the Saturn V; instead, his solution was the RD-270, a single large combustion-chamber engine powered by hypergolic fuels which had almost the same thrust and better specific impulse as compared to the US F-1 rocket engine in addition to using the very advanced full-flow <b>staged</b> <b>combustion</b> concept as opposed to the simple gas generator cycle used by the F-1 rocket engine. This was a primary reason for the failure of the N1, which was forced to rely on a multitude of smaller engines for propulsion because Sergei Korolev, its chief designer, insisted on using the LOX/Kerosene combination, which Glushko felt would take much more time and money to design. Glushko never did overcome the combustion instability problems of large rocket motors using kerosene propellants; his eventual solution for this is seen on the RD-170 which is basically four smaller combustion chamber/nozzle assemblies sharing common fuel delivery systems. This solution and engine gave the Soviets the large thrust propulsion needed to build the Energia superbooster, and is probably the finest technical example of Glushko's abilities when he was at his best. The fact that he never developed this solution until the firing of Vasily Mishin and his gaining ultimate control of the entire Soviet space program {{is a testament to the}} paralyzing intrigue and in-fighting that went on within the Soviet effort to reach the Moon.|$|E

40|$|Premixed diesel {{combustion}} {{is effective}} for high thermal efficiency and reductions of NOx and PM emissions, but {{a reduction of}} combustion noise is necessary for medium-high load engine operation. The control of the fuel injection has become more accurate because of the technical progress of the common rail fuel injection system, and the target heat release shape, calculated by computation, {{can be achieved by}} control of EGR, boosting, fuel injection timing, and injection quantity of multiple fuel injections. In this paper, the reduction of premixed diesel combustion noise maintaining high thermal efficiency has been investigated by the control of injection timings and heating values of multiple fuel injections. There are two aspects of the combustion noise reduction by multiple fuel injections. One is the reduction of the maximum rate of pressure rise in each combustion cycle, and the other is noise reduction effects by the noise cancelling spike (NCS) combustion. The research was conducted with both engine simulations and experiments. In combustion noise simulations, the heat release history of multiple injections was approximated by Wiebe functions and the simulated combustion noise was calculated from the fitted curve of the heat release and the coherence transfer function. The structural attenuation (SA) of the test engine was calculated from the power spectrum of the FFT analysis of the in-cylinder pressure wave data and the cross power spectrum of the sound pressure of the engine noise by the coherence method, then the combustion noise (CNL) can be calculated from the structural attenuation and cylinder pressure level (CPL) in the simulation, as shown in equation 4. The simulation results were confirmed by the engine tests. First, the combustion noise reduction by two stage fuel injection was investigated. The maximum rate of pressure rise changes depending on the combustion occurring separately in the compression and expansion strokes. One heat release was set at TDC and the second before or after the TDC. In the late two <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> as shown in Figure 12 (b), the combustion noise reduction was most effectively achieved when the heating value of Q 2 nd is higher than that of Q 1 st, however in the early two <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> in Figure 12 (a), the Q 1 st heat release occurs during the compression stroke and the combustion noise reduction by the early two <b>stage</b> NCS <b>combustion</b> is more effective than the combustion noise reduction by the late two <b>stage</b> NCS <b>combustion.</b> Three <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> simulations were also investigated at 0. 6 MPa IMEP and 2000 rpm. The optimum heat release shape for low combustion noise and high indicated thermal efficiency was calculated and the role of each part of the heat release in the three <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> is discussed. The simulation predicted 87. 1 dBA of combustion noise and 50. 3 % of indicated thermal efficiency.

40|$|AbstractCool flames are {{commonly}} associated with engine-knock phenomenon in spark ignition engines and autoignition in diesel engines, and results from low temperature partial oxidation of the fuel air mixture that eventually leads to hot flame ignition. However, {{the possibility of a}} cool flame supporting quasi-steady combustion of a fuel droplet has never been speculated, let alone been experimentally observed. Recent microgravity droplet combustion onboard the International Space Station (ISS) under the Flame Extinguishment (FLEX) Experiment Program showed anomalous combustion of n-heptane droplets; high temperature combustion followed by radiative visible extinction and a transition to a second stage burn characterized by loss of visible flame emission. In the second stage the droplet regression continues eventually resulting in extinction diameters characteristic of diffusive extinction. Experimental examples of the two stage burning and extinction characteristics of isolated n-heptane droplets under microgravity conditions are presented and analyzed numerically. Predictions show that the second <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> occurs as a result of chemical kinetics associated with classical premixed “Cool Flame” phenomena. In contrast to the kinetic interactions responsible for premixed cool flame properties, those important to cool flame droplet burning are characteristically associated with the temperature range between the turnover temperature and the hot ignition. Initiation of and continuing second <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> involves a dynamic balance of heat generation from diffusively controlled chemical reaction and heat loss from radiation and diffusion. Within the noted temperature range, increasing reaction temperature leads to decreased chemical reaction rate and vice versa. As a result, changes of heat loss rate are dynamically balanced by heat release from chemical reaction rate as the droplet continue to burn and regress in size. Factors leading to initiation of the second stage burning phenomena are also investigated. The chemical kinetics dictating the second <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> and extinction process is also discussed...|$|R

This paper investigates {{the application of a}} cascading hearth staged combustor to palm shells combustion in terms of fuel feed rate effect on temperature profiles. The application of a two-step hearth setup at primary <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> offers wider alternatives for solid phase combustion processes. Initial combustion studies of palm shells by controlled air combustion conditions using these set-ups show promising results for further development.

Varying the fuel feed at 0. 1, 0. 15 and 0. 2 kg/min with constant air supply of 227 liters/min (8 CFM) and good fuel distribution on the hearth leads to fuel core temperatures exceeding 1000 oC.

The maximum secondary <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> exhaust temperature recorded was 490 oC at 0. 2 kg/min fuel feed, a secondary air supply of 42. 5 liters/min (1. 5 CFM) and a corresponding fuel core temperature of 1225 oC...|$|R
