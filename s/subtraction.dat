On the other hand, a <b>subtraction</b> operation uniquely determines an addition operation, an additive inverse operation, and an additive identity; for this reason, an additive group {{can be described as}} a set that is closed under <b>subtraction.</b>|$|E

The sequences of 20 N-terminal amino acids of these 5 <b>subtractions</b> {{were found to be}} identical. Peptide mapping analyses of the SBP <b>subtractions</b> showed similar patterns, with some differences which might in part be due to the existence of an N-linked carbohydrate chain.

40|$|We {{study the}} Sudakov form factor for a spontaneously broken gauge theory using a (new) Delta -regulator. To be well-defined, the {{effective}} theory requires zero-bin <b>subtractions</b> for the collinear sectors. The zero-bin <b>subtractions</b> {{depend on the}} gauge boson mass M and are not scaleless. They have both finite and 1 /epsilon contributions, and are needed to give the correct anomalous dimension and low-scale matching contributions. We also demonstrate the necessity of zero-bin <b>subtractions</b> for soft-collinear factorization. We find that after zero-bin <b>subtractions</b> the form factor {{is the sum of}} the collinear contributions 'minus' a soft mass-mode contribution, in agreement with a previous result of Idilbi and Mehen in QCD. This appears to conflict with the method-of-regions approach, where one gets the sum of contributions from different regions. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures. V 2 :ref adde...|$|R

5|$|A finite {{field is}} a set of numbers with four {{generalized}} operations. The operations are called addition, <b>subtraction,</b> multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity. An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers {0,1,2,…,12} using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, <b>subtraction,</b> multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5×7=35mod13=9. Such finite fields can be defined for any prime p; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power m of a prime p'm. Finite fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as GF(p) or GF(p'm).|$|E
5|$|Convolution {{is used to}} add two {{independent}} random variables defined by distribution functions. Its usual definition combines integration, <b>subtraction,</b> and multiplication.

5|$|The SSEM had a 32-bit {{word length}} and {{a memory of}} 32words (1 kilobit).

The first of three programs written for the machine found the highest proper divisor of 218 (262,144), a calculation that was known would {{take a long time to}} run—and so prove the computer's reliability—by testing every integer from 218−1 downwards, as division was implemented by repeated <b>subtraction</b> of the divisor. The program consisted of 17instructions and ran for 52minutes before reaching the correct answer of 131,072, after the SSEM had performed 3.5million operations (for an effective CPU speed of 1.1 kIPS).|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} non-Gaussianity (nG) plays in the enhancement of the fidelity in continuous-variable quantum teleportation of ideal Braunstein and Kimble (BK) protocol for coherent states, theoretically. The de-Gaussification procedure is realized through subtracting photons on the two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TMSVs). We find that the high fidelity always refers to a symmetrical arrangement of photon <b>subtractions</b> on the different modes of the TMSVs. The non-Gaussian resources demonstrate commendable superiorities compare with the Gaussian resources only for symmetrical arrangements of photon <b>subtractions,</b> however, the asymmetrical arrangements do not. When {{the total number of}} photon <b>subtractions</b> be a constant, we find that the optimal nG procedure prefers the most asymmetrical arrangement of <b>subtractions.</b> This characteristic is not consistent with the result that the highest fidelity refers to a symmetrical case. Under the same squeezing parameter, a higher nG might not always lead to a higher fidelity. Comment: updated to published version, some references are adde...|$|R

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly.

The basic operations of addition, <b>subtraction,</b> scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E

5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{calculation}} of Taylor series {{of a large number}} of functions. One can attempt to use the definition of the Taylor series, though this often requires generalizing the form of the coefficients according to a readily apparent pattern. Alternatively, one can use manipulations such as substitution, multiplication or division, addition or <b>subtraction</b> of standard Taylor series to construct the Taylor series of a function, by virtue of Taylor series being power series. In some cases, one can also derive the Taylor series by repeatedly applying integration by parts. Particularly convenient is the use of computer algebra systems to calculate Taylor series.|$|E
5|$|Some {{approaches}} explicitly define real {{numbers to}} be certain structures built upon the rational numbers, using axiomatic set theory. The natural numbers – 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on – begin with 0 and continue upwards, so that every number has a successor. One can extend the natural numbers with their negatives to give all the integers, and to further extend to ratios, giving the rational numbers. These number systems are accompanied by the arithmetic of addition, <b>subtraction,</b> multiplication, and division. More subtly, they include ordering, so that one number {{can be compared to}} another and found to be less than, greater than, or equal to another number.|$|E

5|$|As well as addition, <b>subtraction,</b> {{multiplication}} and division, it had reciprocal and square-root functions, and {{the ability}} to multiply by a fixed constant. With an eight-digit display, the calculator could display positive numbers between 0.0000001 and 99,999,999, and negative numbers between -0.000001 and -9,999,999. Calculators of the time tended to have displays of between 3 and 12 digits, as reducing the number of digits was an effective way of reducing the cost of the calculator. A number outside that range leads to an overflow, and the screen flashes and all keys except the clear key are rendered inoperable to inform the user of the error. A independent memory register could read information from the screen, and information could only be taken from the memory onto the screen. Five keys were used for memory operations.|$|E
5|$|For comparison, Euclid's {{original}} subtraction-based algorithm {{can be much}} slower. A single integer {{division is}} equivalent to the quotient q number of subtractions. If the ratio of a and b is very large, the quotient is large and many subtractions will be required. On the other hand, {{it has been shown that}} the quotients are very likely to be small integers. The probability of a given quotient q is approximately ln|u/(u−1)| where u=(q+1)2. For illustration, the probability of a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of <b>subtraction</b> is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid's algorithm.|$|E
