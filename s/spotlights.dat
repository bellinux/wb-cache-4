5|$|On January 12, 1999, the <b>spotlights</b> {{surrounding}} the Peace Candle were accidentally turned on, {{and the heat}} from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees {{surrounding the}} structure. Several residents called police and sprayed the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only the trees were damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident. New <b>spotlights</b> were installed in 2000, which lit the candle from top to bottom and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighting}} system is programmed to darken the set as the contestant progresses {{further into the}} game. There are also <b>spotlights</b> situated {{at the bottom of}} the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such <b>spotlights,</b> oil is vaporized, creating a haze effect. Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University, stated that the show's {{lighting system}} made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.|$|E

5|$|The {{drive to}} capture wildlife, and {{particularly}} slow lorises, is increasingly dominated by demands from wealthy urban areas, replacing the subsistence hunting traditionally performed in poor rural areas. In {{the case of}} long-lived primates, such as the slow lorises, populations replenish themselves slowly. Slow lorises are particularly vulnerable {{because they tend to}} freeze when spotted. Lastly, increased access to new technologies, such as improved transport, guns, wire snares, and <b>spotlights,</b> have facilitated hunting and pushed extraction levels beyond the point of sustainability. These new factors threaten slow loris survival.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have been}} hunting mammals in Asia {{for at least}} 40,000years, but until recently, slow lorises were only hunted at a {{sustainable}} level. However, hunting pressure since the 1960s has become increasingly unsustainable, leading to overexploitation, because of growing demand, decreased supply, and the subsequent increased value of the marketed wildlife. In 1985, large wildlife markets {{began to appear in}} Phnom Penh and Sen Monorom, Cambodia, followed quickly by the development of networks of hunters, traders, and middlemen. Bright flashlights make spotting slow lorises much easier at night because of their eye shine, and in the 1990s, large-scale commercial harvesting of slow lorises began as improved batteries for <b>spotlights</b> became available.|$|E

5|$|In {{the street}} outside the theatre a street {{carnival}} took place. Living up to the moniker for the theater's marquee, “the Magic Sign of a Wonderful Time,” <b>spotlights</b> scanned the night sky, banks of Klieg lights illuminated the streets outside the theater, and flares were shot from the roofs of nearby buildings. Additionally, dance bands were placed at the closed intersections to provide entertainment and, using giant screens to project the words, a sing-along was orchestrated on Fifth Avenue {{in front of the}} theatre. An estimated crowd of between 50,000 and 100,000 people participated in the events.|$|E
5|$|Rodgers {{had long}} {{wanted to write}} a musical comedy about the cast and crew {{backstage}} at a theatre. After Rodgers and Hammerstein had another hit with The King and I in 1951, Rodgers proposed the backstage project to his partner. Hammerstein was unenthusiastic, thinking the subject matter trivial, but agreed to do the project. The play required complex machinery, designed by Jo Mielziner, so that the audience could view action not only on the stage of the theatre where the show-within-the-show (also named Me and Juliet) takes place, but in the wings and on the light bridge (high above the stage, from which the lighting technicians train <b>spotlights)</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows. Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with <b>spotlights.</b> Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were shining through them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using light bulbs for the eyes of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of good and bad in superstitions, and they always seem to be watching over the cities. This resonated with his view of the raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E

5|$|On 20 November 1992, a {{major fire}} {{occurred}} at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread {{damage to the}} Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated {{as part of a}} long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the <b>spotlights</b> being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, at great risk to the 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire.|$|E
5|$|The outdoor {{scene in}} which Xander sees Buffy in the sandbox was {{intentionally}} overexposed, intensifying the foreground and blowing out the background, making the sky look white; flash frames were also used in the shot of Buffy in the desert. Whedon allowed some shots to last far longer than is common in a television episode; this cinematic technique allowed the images to take on meaning. Highly stylized lighting is used throughout Xander's dream. In the university hallway the scene is lit with green and orange gels, while the almost shot-for-shot re-creation of the Apocalypse Now section is lit with carefully controlled <b>spotlights</b> which allow the background to fall out to black. Whedon cites The Limey as an inspiration for the unnaturally colored university sequence, and had the scene from Apocalypse Now playing on tape during filming to ensure as close a match as possible for that sequence. When Xander is driving the ice cream truck with Anya, the backgrounds outside the car intentionally look fake, to {{give a sense of}} stillness where there should be motion. Whedon originally wanted to use rear-screen projection for the driving scene, but had to utilize greenscreen instead, as rear-screen projection would be difficult to set up on their stages. Some special effects shots came about by accident; in his commentary Whedon explains that when Buffy smeared the mud all over her face, it looked as though she was giving herself a facial. He therefore dissolved the shot into a negative image, creating intense colors that made the shot more interesting.|$|E

50|$|In social judgment, embarrassment plays a {{considerable}} {{role in the}} degree to which the <b>spotlight</b> effect is manifested. Research by Gilovich, Kruger, and Medvec indicated that certain situations in which perceivably embarrassing items are factors, such as an embarrassing t-shirt, increase the extent to which the <b>spotlight</b> effect is experienced by an individual. The timing of the exposure during a perceivably embarrassing situation also plays a role in the severity of the <b>spotlight</b> effect. If the exposure is immediate, the <b>spotlight</b> effect significantly increases in decision making scenarios. Delayed exposure, however, decreases <b>spotlight</b> effect intensity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This article {{introduces}} <b>spotlight</b> tilings of rectilinear regions. <b>Spotlight</b> tiling {{differs from}} the customary methods of tiling, and is defined inductively as follows: a tile begins in a northwest corner of a region, and extends as far south or east as possible. Some distinguishing aspects of <b>spotlight</b> tiling include that {{the order in which}} tiles are placed in a region affects what tiles may be placed subsequently, and the number of tiles in a <b>spotlight</b> tiling of a particular region is not fixed. A thorough examination of <b>spotlight</b> tilings of rectangles is presented, including the distribution of such tilings using a fixed number of tiles, and how the directions of the tiles themselves are distributed. The <b>spotlight</b> tilings of several other regions are studied, and suggest that further analysis of <b>spotlight</b> tilings will continue to yield elegant results and enumerations. 1...|$|R
