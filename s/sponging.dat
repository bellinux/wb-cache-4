5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect it when searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as <b>sponging,</b> has only been observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related, suggesting {{that it is a}} fairly recent innovation.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{investigations}} of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (<b>sponging)</b> and transmit cultural knowledge across generations, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television {{programs such as}} Flipper. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that both ecological and cultural factors predict which dolphins use sponges as tools. <b>Sponging</b> occurs more frequently in areas with higher distribution of sponges, which tends to occur in deeper water channels. <b>Sponging</b> is heavily sex-biased to females. Genetic analyses suggest that all spongers are descendants of a single matriline, suggesting cultural transmission {{of the use of}} sponges as tools. <b>Sponging</b> may be socially learned from mother to offspring. Social grouping behavior suggests homophily (the tendency to associate with similar others) among dolphins that share socially learned skills such as sponge tool use. <b>Sponging</b> has only been observed in Shark Bay.|$|E

5000|$|In 1947, a {{red tide}} algae bloom {{wiped out the}} <b>sponge</b> fields in the Gulf of Mexico, causing many of the <b>sponge</b> boats and divers to switch to fishing shrimping for their livelihood, while others left the business. Eventually, the <b>sponges</b> recovered, {{allowing}} for a smaller but consistent <b>sponge</b> industry today. In the 1980s, the <b>sponge</b> business experienced a boom due to a <b>sponge</b> disease that killed the Mediterranean <b>sponges.</b> Today {{there is still a}} small active <b>sponge</b> industry. Visitors can often view <b>sponge</b> fishermen working at the <b>Sponge</b> Docks on Dodecanese Boulevard. In addition, visitors can enjoy shops, restaurants, and museum exhibits that detail Tarpon Springs' Greek heritage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sponges</b> are {{commonly}} made from cellulose wood fibers or foamed plastic polymers. Some natural <b>sponges</b> are still sold, with most now used either as body or facial <b>sponges</b> (bath <b>sponges)</b> or as tools for <b>sponge</b> painting. Bath <b>sponges</b> help cleanse the skin by scraping away the dead skin and washing away dirt.|$|R
25|$|<b>Sponging</b> {{mouthparts}} {{are used}} to sponge and suck liquids, and lack stylets (e.g. most Diptera).|$|E
25|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries (1841–1938), Greek spongers immigrated to Andros {{for the rich}} sponge fishing on the Great Bahama Bank off Andros' west coast. For a period of years, Andros <b>sponging</b> was the Bahamas' largest {{industry}}. In the 1930s, the sponges were wiped out by a Red Tide infestation. The <b>sponging</b> industry died, and the spongers left the island for Key West, and Tarpon Springs, Florida. Thousands of unemployed Bahamians moved {{to the village of}} Coconut Grove near Miami.|$|E
25|$|Salmonellosis {{has also}} been proven to be {{transmitted}} by the blow fly through saliva, feces and direct contact by the flies' tarsi. Adult flies {{may be able to}} spread pathogens via their <b>sponging</b> mouthparts, vomit, intestinal tract, sticky pads of their feet, or even their body or leg hairs.|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that <b>sponges</b> differ in the abundance of associated microorganisms, and they are therefore termed either 'low microbial abundance' (LMA) or 'high microbial abundance' (HMA) <b>sponges.</b> Many previous studies concentrated on the dense microbial communities in HMA <b>sponges,</b> whereas {{little is known about}} microorganisms in LMA <b>sponges.</b> Here, two LMA <b>sponges</b> from the Red Sea, two from the Caribbean and one from the South Pacific were investigated. With up to only five bacterial phyla per <b>sponge,</b> all LMA <b>sponges</b> showed lower phylum-level diversity than typical HMA <b>sponges.</b> Interestingly, each LMA <b>sponge</b> was dominated by a large clade within either Cyanobacteria or different classes of Proteobacteria. The overall similarity of bacterial communities among LMA <b>sponges</b> determined by operational taxonomic unit and UniFrac analysis was low. Also the number of sponge-specific clusters, which indicate bacteria specifically associated with <b>sponges</b> and which are numerous in HMA <b>sponges,</b> was low. A biogeographical or host-dependent distribution pattern was not observed. In conclusion, bacterial community profiles of LMA <b>sponges</b> are clearly different from profiles of HMA <b>sponges</b> and, remarkably, each LMA <b>sponge</b> seems to harbour its own unique bacterial community. © 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies...|$|R
5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than <b>sponges)</b> are {{more closely related to}} particular groups of <b>sponges</b> than {{to the rest of the}} <b>sponges.</b> Such conclusions imply that <b>sponges</b> are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all <b>sponges</b> would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not <b>sponges.</b> A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within <b>sponges</b> was between glass <b>sponges</b> and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more closely related to calcareous <b>sponges,</b> those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of <b>sponge.</b> In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass <b>sponges</b> are more closely related to each other than either is to calcareous <b>sponges,</b> which in turn are more closely related to Eumetazoa.|$|R
50|$|Ianthella basta or {{elephant}} ear <b>sponge</b> is {{a species of}} fan-shaped <b>sponge</b> in the class Demospongiae. It {{is also known as}} the paper <b>sponge</b> or scroll <b>sponge.</b>|$|R
25|$|Adults {{commonly}} feed on {{the blood}} of mammals. They are able to reopen wounds that are almost completely healed. Mouthpart morphology in the genus ranges from <b>sponging</b> mouthparts to mouths with rasping teeth. Many species have enlarged prestomal teeth. The metathoracic spiracle is covered in long, thick setae. The average male Hydrotaea is 6.5-8.5mm and the average female is 5.75-7.5mm. They are very light brown to bluish black with large, red eyes and plumose antennae.|$|E
25|$|Some limited {{evidence}} supports <b>sponging</b> or bathing feverish children with tepid water. The {{use of a}} fan or air conditioning may somewhat reduce the temperature and increase comfort. If the temperature reaches the extremely high level of hyperpyrexia, aggressive cooling is required (generally produced mechanically via conduction by applying numerous ice packs across most of the body or direct submersion in ice water). In general, people are advised to keep adequately hydrated. Whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illnesses such as the common cold is not known.|$|E
25|$|The mouthparts, {{along with}} the rest of the head, can be {{articulated}} in at least three different positions: prognathous, opisthognathous, and hypognathous. In species with prognathous articulation, the head is positioned vertically aligned with the body, such as species of Formicidae; while in a hypognathous type, the head is aligned horizontally adjacent to the body. An opisthognathous head is positioned diagonally, such as species of Blattodea and some Coleoptera. The mouthparts vary greatly between insects of different orders, but the two main functional groups are mandibulate and haustellate. Haustellate mouthparts are used for sucking liquids and can be further classified by the presence of stylets, which include piercing-sucking, <b>sponging,</b> and siphoning. The stylets are needle-like projections used to penetrate plant and animal tissues. The stylets and the feeding tube form the modified mandibles, maxilla, and hypopharynx.|$|E
5000|$|Sponge: Using a <b>sponge</b> {{to apply}} {{foundation}} {{is great for}} creating a sheer to medium cover look. A triangular <b>sponge</b> is good for blending in liquid foundation and concealer, whilst a rounded <b>sponge</b> is best for powder foundations. Wet a clean <b>sponge</b> with water first: the moisture will help prevent the <b>sponge</b> from absorbing the makeup, but make sure to squeeze out excess water. The <b>sponge</b> will also assist in blending. Try to find <b>sponges</b> with pointed tips for superb blending of the eye area. Also, note that reusing <b>sponges</b> can be unhygienic, so <b>sponges</b> should be washed and dried thoroughly after every use.|$|R

25|$|These are {{medium to}} large flies of compact structure, with clear wings of complex venation. Antennae are highly {{characteristic}} with antennae consisting of several compact segments that {{lie in a}} deep groove between the eyes; the outermost segment of each antenna bears a feather like structure, the arista, which projects forwards. Species within Musca, Hydrotaea, and similar genera have mouthparts adapted for <b>sponging</b> nutritious liquids with their labellar lobes (see photograph of Calliphora mouthparts which also have this sponge structure). Some species of this type, such as Musca vestustissima (Australian bush-fly) also have, {{as part of this}} sponge structure, small teeth that can scrape at host's skin down to superficial capillaries to feed on blood. Cattle are a typical host for Musca and similar species of house-flies that are attracted to protein containing liquids at the eyes and nostrils of their hosts.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most other}} flies, the black blow fly feeds via <b>sponging,</b> having {{functional}} or nonfunctional mouthparts. They {{are known to}} feed on various foods, with emphasis on nectar, honey-dew, and the liquid products of decomposition. P. regina, like other flies, is poikilothermic; the growth {{and development of the}} fly is dependent on temperature. At room temperature, the egg to pupal stage lasts about 6–11 h. With an increase in temperature of the surrounding environment, metabolic rates of the blow fly typically increase, causing an increase in the rate of growth and development. In addition to an increase in the growth and development, temperature also has a profound impact on female oviposition. It is key to note the fluctuations between diurnal and nocturnal temperatures. Typically, blow flies will oviposit in the daytime due to the increase of temperature.|$|E
25|$|Mouthparts {{can have}} {{multiple}} functions. Some insects combine piercing parts along with <b>sponging</b> ones {{which are then}} used to pierce through tissues of plants and animals. Female mosquitoes feed on blood (hemophagous) making them disease vectors. The mosquito mouthparts consist of the proboscis, paired mandibles and maxillae. The maxillae form needle-like structures, called stylets, which are enclosed by the labium. When mosquito bites, maxillae penetrate the skin and anchor the mouthparts, thus allowing other parts to be inserted. The sheath-like labium slides back, and the remaining mouthparts pass through its tip and into the tissue. Then, through the hypopharynx, the mosquito injects saliva, which contains anticoagulants to stop the blood from clotting. And finally, the labrum (upper lip) is used to suck up the blood. Species of the genus Anopheles are characterized by their long palpi (two parts with widening end), almost reaching the end of labrum.|$|E
25|$|The {{last two}} decades have seen a renewed {{interest}} in the potential for <b>sponge</b> aquaculture to contribute to supplying the growing global demand for bath <b>sponges.</b> Bath <b>sponges</b> are the most common use of aquacultured sea <b>sponge</b> today. Bath <b>sponges</b> can be defined as any <b>sponge</b> species possessing only spongin fibers – which are springy fibres made from collagen protein.|$|R
5000|$|Other <b>sponge</b> species {{abundant}} on <b>sponge</b> reefs {{are members}} of the order Lyssactinosa (Rosselid <b>sponges)</b> and include Rhabdocalyptus dawsoni (boot <b>sponge),</b> Acanthascus platei, Acanthascus cactus and Staurocalyptus dowlingi. Rosselid <b>sponges</b> have a [...] "woven" [...] or [...] "loose" [...] siliceous skeleton that does not persist after the death of the <b>sponge,</b> and are capable of forming mats, but not reefs.|$|R
25|$|Bath <b>sponges</b> are {{currently}} being produced using the <b>sponge</b> Coscinoderma matthewsi with production of about 12,000 <b>sponges,</b> sold locally to residents and tourists in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia. These <b>sponges</b> {{are one of the}} only true sustainably farmed sea <b>sponges</b> in the world. The <b>sponges</b> are farmed via the rope method, with low investment costs of a few thousand dollars for farming and maintenance equipment, producing 100% natural <b>sponges</b> with no harsh chemicals added during processing.|$|R
25|$|Disease {{caused by}} the feeding {{activity}} of dipteran flies is described here under Parasitic disease. Disease caused by small pathogenic organisms that pass from the flies to domestic animals is described here under Transmitted organisms; these organisms are often of numerous species thus only prominent examples are provided. Feeding by adult flies may cause irritation through to acute stress from painful bites, resulting in loss of grazing time and reduced gain in weight. Feeding by adult flies on the blood of their hosts exposes the hosts to pathogenic organisms that are infecting the fly, {{this can lead to}} acute disease of the host's blood and other organs. Feeding by adult flies using their <b>sponging</b> mouthparts can also expose the hosts to pathogenic organisms that have contaminated the mouthparts. Larvae of some flies are adapted to feed on the tissues of their host causing direct pathological damage to organs, this is known as myiasis.|$|E
25|$|The {{mouthparts}} {{of insects}} that feed on fluids are modified {{in various ways}} to form a tube through which liquid can be drawn into the mouth and usually another through which saliva passes. The muscles of the cibarium or pharynx are strongly developed to form a pump. In nonbiting flies, the mandibles are absent and other structures are reduced; the labial palps have become modified to form the labellum, and the maxillary palps are present, although sometimes short. In Brachycera, the labellum is especially prominent and used for <b>sponging</b> liquid or semiliquid food. The labella are a complex structure consisting of many grooves, called pseudotrachea, which sops up liquids. Salivary secretions from the labella assist in dissolving and collecting food particles {{so they can be}} more easily taken up by the pseudotracheae; this is thought to occur by capillary action. The liquid food is then drawn up from the pseudotracheae through the food channel into the esophagus.|$|E
25|$|Some of the brachyceran flies are {{important}} transmitters of pathogenic organisms through a route known as mechanical (or contaminative) transmission. These flies have complex cutting mouthparts {{that make a}} superficial wound in skin. Blood flowing into the wound is sponged up by the labella organ of the mouthparts (see photograph of Tabanus mouthparts). The flies tend to take small meals from many hosts at short intervals, to avoid the defensive actions of their hosts. Fresh blood on the labella may contaminate other hosts with pathogenic organisms. Many species of brachyceran flies such as the house-flies and blow-flies that do not feed on blood are also mechanical transmitters of pathogenic organisms by a contaminative route on their mouthparts used for <b>sponging</b> up wet nutritious secretions on skin of vertebrate animals. Usually the mechanical transmission of microbes by flies does not involve any developmental stage of the microorganism in the fly. However, some brachyceran flies, such {{as a group of}} species of Glossina genus {{are important}} biological transmitters, not mechanical.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sponge</b> {{aquaculture}} for spongin or metabolite production capitalises on {{the high}} regenerative abilities of the totipotent <b>sponge</b> cells by using explants (cut pieces of a parent <b>sponge,</b> which will then regrow into a full <b>sponge)</b> {{as a means of}} culturing <b>sponges.</b> <b>Sponges</b> have indeterminate growth, with maximum growth determined through environmental constraints rather than genetics.

50|$|Sea <b>sponges</b> {{should be}} cultured at a {{salinity}} of 35ppt (salinity of seawater). Hypersalinity (high salt concentrations) {{in the immediate}} environment surrounding a <b>sponge</b> will dehydrate <b>sponge</b> cells, whereas a hyposaline (low salt concentration) environment dilutes the intracellular environment of the <b>sponge.</b> The pH of water must match that of seawater (pH 7.8-8.4) in order for <b>sponge</b> production to be maximized.Sponges are sensitive to temperature, and extreme fluctuations in ambient temperature can negatively affect the health of sea <b>sponges.</b> High temperatures lead to crashes in <b>sponge</b> cultures. Symbiotic bacteria that normally inhabit sea <b>sponges</b> start reproducing at an unsustainable rate when ambient temperature of the water increases by a few degrees.

Edmondson revealed that [...] "Abra comes back as a patient because some trauma has happened in Africa {{and he will be}} <b>sponging</b> off Ric." [...] Expanding on this, he explained: [...] "Abra’s in a very fragile state, as he’s suffering from post-traumatic stress. He keeps hurting himself, but no one knows why. Ric’s pretty off with Abra at first, but he agrees to let him stay at his place for a week. Abra used to be a nice guy, but he’s horrible now. Something happened to him on his travels, though even I haven’t been told what it is yet. What I do know is that Abra has a huge machete scar on his back... I imagine he’s been though some horror." [...] He has stated that this appearance in the show will last four or five months, and that he doesn't yet know how the character will be written out this time, beyond there being [...] "some kind of mental-health issue." [...] It emerged that Abra had borne witness to a violent attack on the hospital he was working in the Congo, eventually leading to him checking into a psychiatric unit. After being discovered being treated by his own mother, Kyla and Lola Griffin convinced him to discharge himself and return to Ghana. He returned briefly to Holby in December 2008, when he convinced Kyla to move to Ghana with him, proposing marriage to her.|$|E
