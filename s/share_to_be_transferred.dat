50|$|In the 1950s, Autry {{had been}} a {{minority}} owner of the minor-league Hollywood Stars. In 1960, when Major League Baseball announced plans to add an expansion team in Los Angeles, Autry—who had once declined an opportunity {{to play in the}} minor leagues—expressed an interest in acquiring the radio broadcast rights to the team's games. Baseball executives were so impressed by his approach that he was persuaded to become the owner of the franchise rather than simply its broadcast partner. The team, initially called the Los Angeles Angels upon its 1961 debut, moved to suburban Anaheim in 1966, and was renamed the California Angels, then the Anaheim Angels from 1997 until 2005, when it became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Autry served as vice president of the American League from 1983 until his death. In 1995, he sold a quarter share of the team to the Walt Disney Company and a controlling interest the following year, with the remaining <b>share</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> after his death. Earlier, in 1982, he sold Los Angeles television station KTLA for $245 million. He also sold several radio stations he owned, including KSFO in San Francisco, KMPC in Los Angeles, KOGO in San Diego, and other stations in the Golden West radio network.|$|E

Yingjun then meets two young women: Shuiling and Wenya. Shuiling is his first girlfriend, but through Martin's arrangement, Shuiling also gets to know Anxin at the same time. When Anxin divorces Meixue in favour of Shuiling, Yingjun's girlfriend (though {{he does not know}} it), Meixue requests 30% of Da Ying Jia's <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> Yingjun.|$|R
50|$|In 1982 the oil {{companies}} decided they no longer wished to continue their involvement with the journal. The Trustees agreed to a proposal for the <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> a group of senior staff, headed by the editor. In 1989, the majority shareholding of The Petroleum Economist Limited <b>was</b> sold <b>to</b> Euromoney Plc. In 1991 other titles including Gas World International and Natural Gas were acquired, as gas became {{an important part of}} the energy mix. With the death of the Japanese editor in June 1993, the last foreign language edition ceased publication. During the 1990s a cartographic department <b>was</b> added <b>to</b> publish energy maps. The company also expanded into the provision of energy training courses and energy books. In 2005 Power Economics magazine <b>was</b> acquired <b>to</b> provide a further dimension to the company.|$|R
500|$|This {{is part of}} the [...] "orthodox" [...] or [...] "strict" [...] rule, {{along with}} Re Goldcorp. The {{exception}} <b>to</b> this rule <b>is</b> found in Hunter v Moss, which concerned 50 <b>shares</b> meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> an employee out of a total holding of 950. These shares were not individually identified, but Dillon LJ held that this was irrelevant because the shares were all of the same type and in the same company, and so it made no difference which particular shares <b>were</b> <b>transferred.</b> This <b>was</b> applied in Re Harvard Securities, where Neuberger J held that there was a difference between tangible property, such as wine, and intangible property, such as shares. Intangible property, by its very nature, does not require segregation.|$|R
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve his {{financial}} problems, Greenleaf sold his shares in the NALC to Nicholson and Morris on May 28, 1796, for $1.5 million. Unfortunately, Morris and Nicholson funded their purchase by giving Greenleaf personal notes. Furthermore, they endorsed one another's notes. Morris and Nicholson, themselves nearly bankrupt, agreed to pay one-quarter {{of the purchase price}} every year for the next for years. Greenleaf's <b>shares</b> <b>were</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> Morris and Nicholson until the fourth payment was received.|$|R
5000|$|It is a {{requirement}} that the subject matter be certain — that the property intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the trust be separated from other property, showing clarity in what <b>is</b> intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trust property. If {{there is no clear}} separation, the trust will fail, as in Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd. This point was illustrated by Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd, where creditors of a bankrupt wine trading company argued that they should <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> claim the wine they had paid for. The problem was that these bottles were not individually identifiable, and Oliver J held that: [...] I appreciate the point taken that the subject matter is a part of a homogeneous mass so that specific identity is of as little as importance as it is, for instance, in the case of money. Nevertheless, as it seems to me, to create a trust it must <b>be</b> possible <b>to</b> ascertain with certainty not only what the interest of the beneficiary <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> but <b>to</b> what property it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> attach. [...] A sum of money, say 10,000, does not satisfy the requirement, rendering uncertainty. This is part of the [...] "orthodox" [...] or [...] "strict" [...] rule, along with Re Goldcorp. The exception <b>to</b> this rule <b>is</b> found in Hunter v Moss, which concerned 50 <b>shares</b> meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> an employee out of a total holding of 950. These shares were not individually identified, but Dillon LJ held that this was irrelevant because the shares were all of the same type and in the same company, and so it made no difference which particular shares <b>were</b> <b>transferred.</b> This <b>was</b> applied in Re Harvard Securities, where Neuberger J held that there was a difference between tangible property, such as wine, and intangible property, such as shares. Intangible property, by its very nature, does not require segregation.A failure in the formality of this head would lead to the property being result back to the estate on resulting trust.|$|R
50|$|The {{dock and}} the {{associated}} machinery had a book value of 440,000 marks, but due to low usage, it had brought just 6,200 marks' average annual gross income during 1870-1879, which <b>was</b> not enough <b>to</b> cover even the costs. The engineering works was the only profitable part of the company; during 1870-1876 it brought an average annual profit of 40,000 marks; however, this <b>was</b> not enough <b>to</b> repay the investment, as {{the value of the}} engineering works <b>was</b> set <b>to</b> 286,000 marks without inventory. An analysis presented in an extraordinary general meeting on 11 September 1879 suggested that the engineering works including the inventory could be sold for 483,000 marks, whereas the dock shall be regarded valueless. The board did not share the view that the dock worths nothing. The following general meeting took place one week after, and Tampere Linen and Iron Industry decided to set the value of Helsingfors Skeppsdocka to total 700,000 marks, of which the dock was 150,000 marks. The shipbuilding company <b>was</b> planned <b>to</b> take over liabilities of 300,000 marks and the owning company got 4,000 shares, each worth of 100 marks; some of the <b>shares</b> <b>were</b> planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> the company owners. The plan was cancelled, because the state did not allow transferring the liabilities to Helsingfors Skeppsdocka. The balance for year 1879 showed 71,000 marks' loss, which further increased the desire to sell the company.|$|R
50|$|The Authorized Capital Stock of {{the bank}} is 100 billion US Dollars, divided into 1 million shares of 100 000 dollars each. Twenty percent are paid-in shares (and thus have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> the bank), and 80% are {{callable}} shares. The allocated shares {{are based on the}} size of each member country's economy (calculated using GDP Nominal (60%) and GDP PPP (40%)), whether they are an Asian or Non-Asian Member, and the number of shares determines the fraction of authorized capital in the bank. Of the prospective founding members, three states decided not to subscribe to all allocated shares: Malaysia, Portugal and Singapore, resulting in 98% of available <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subscribed.|$|R
