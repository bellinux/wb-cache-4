However, we found this is amplified at the return channel due to flow separation at reduced flows (depending on return channel geometry), and the amplified non-uniform flow did induce impeller stall by reverse propagation from the return channel to the impeller. These non-uniform flows caused a significant operating range reduction for a large flow coefficient impeller. The aerodynamics issues were mitigated using CFD analysis techniques, and eventually confirmed by the compressor performance during shop performance testing. The OEM conducted the CFD analyses using two (2) return channel geometries with several CFD models to verify {{the effect of the}} return channel geometry on impeller stall and to confirm the most suitable CFD modeling method for stall evaluation. Shop performance tests utilizing both return channel geometries were conducted and compared to the CFD analyses. These studies were conducted while collaborating with the end-user. The steady CFD calculation was conducted with frozen rotor interface between full annulus impeller and stator parts. The modeling of diffuser and return channel was varied as follows: 1) 1 -pitch model for the return channel with mixing plane at diffuser? 2) Full-annulus model for the return channel with a mixing plane at the diffuser? 3) Full-annulus model for the return channel without a mixing plane at the diffuser. From the above studies and the shop performance testing, it was confirmed that the proposed CFD modeling method could simulate the measurements taken during the shop performance tests and that the CFD modeling method utilized was key to properly evaluating stall phenomena...|$|E

40|$|Pumping {{stations}} play {{an important}} role in agriculture development projects. Performance of the pumping stations should satisfy water requirements, and management. There are many problems face these pumping stations affecting their reliability and stability. Hydraulic problems are the most important item in the field of pumping station operation and design. Motivation of this research was presence of wear and pitting impellers and <b>casing</b> of double <b>suction</b> volute <b>casing</b> centrifugal pumps for Ahmed Orabee Pumping Station. Vibration level, hydraulic performance test and visual inspection of impeller wear and pitting show that cavitation problem is the cause of damage. Cavitation normally occurs when liquid at a constant temperature is subjected to vapor pressure either by static or dynamic means. If the local pressure somewhere in the fluid drops to or below vapor pressure and nuclei are present, vapor cavities can be formed. As long as the local pressure stays at vapor pressure and cavity has reached a critical diameter, it will continue to grow rapidly. If the surrounding pressure is above vapor pressure, the bubbles become unstable and collapse. Th...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} the flow field in a three stage axial flow compressor, {{including}} a detailed survey at the exit of an embedded stator {{as well as the}} overall performance of the compressor is presented and interpreted in this paper. The measurements include area traverse of a miniature five hole probe (1. 07 mm dia) downstream of stator 2, radial traverses of a miniature five hole probe at the inlet, downstream of stator 3 and at the exit of the compressor at various circumferential locations, area traverse of a low response thermocouple probe downstream of stator 2, radial traverses of a single sensor hot-wire probe at the inlet, and casing static pressure measurements at various circumferential and axial locations across the compressor at the peak efficiency operating point. Mean velocity, pressure and total temperature contours as well as secondary flow contours at the exit of the stator 2 are reported and interpreted. Secondary flow contours show the migration of fluid particles toward the core of the low pressure regions located near the <b>suction</b> side <b>casing</b> endwall corner...|$|R
