5000|$|<b>Silanization</b> is the {{covering}} of a surface with organofunctional alkoxysilane molecules. Mineral components like glass and metal oxide surfaces {{can all be}} silanized, because they contain hydroxyl groups which attack and displace the alkoxy groups on the silane thus forming a covalent -Si-O-Si- bond. The goal of <b>silanization</b> is to form bonds across the interface between mineral components and organic components present in paints, adhesives, etc. <b>Silanization</b> (or siliconization) of glassware increases its hydrophobicity and is used in cell culturing to reduce adherence of cells to flask walls.|$|E

50|$|The matrix {{material}} has more {{influence on the}} tensile properties. Tensile strength may be highly improved by a chemical surface treatment of the particles, such as <b>silanization,</b> which allows the formation of strong bonds between glass particles and epoxy matrix. Addition of fibrous materials can also increase the tensile strength.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>silanization</b> of {{silicate}} surfaces {{was introduced}} more than 40 years ago, {{the process of}} formation of smooth layers on surfaces is still poorly understood. Probably {{the most important reason}} for this situation is that a number of studies that have involved <b>silanization</b> as part of the procedure have not been concerned with thoroughly characterizing the silane layer formed. The one result that unifies recent studies on the characterization of silane layers is centered on the extreme sensitivity of the reactions that lead to the formation of silane layers. Indeed, self-assembled layers of silanes on silicate surfaces have been reported to be dependent on various parameters such as humidity, temperature, impurities in the silane reagent and the type of silicate surface. In order to consistently and reproducibly make diverse functionalized surfaces with layers that are molecularly smooth, it is critical to understand the chemistry of the silicate surfaces {{and the ways in which}} various parameters affect the nature of the self-assembled layers.|$|E
50|$|Vapor-phase <b>silanization</b> {{has been}} {{approached}} {{as a way}} to circumvent the complexities of trace water in solution and silane purity. Since oligomers and polymers of silanes have negligible vapor pressure at the reaction temperatures commonly used, they do not reach the surface of the silicate during deposition. Since there is no solvent in the system, it is easier to control the amount of water in the reaction. Smooth monolayers have been reported for vapor-phase silanizations of several types of silanes, including aminosilanes, octadecyltrimethoxysilane and fluoalkyl silanes. However, the nature of the attachment of the silane molecules to the substrate is uncertain, although siloxane bond formation can be favored by soaking the substrate in water following deposition.|$|E
50|$|Oxidized silicon {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied as a substrate for the deposition of biomolecules. Piranha solution {{can be used to}} increase the surface density of reactive hydroxyl groups on the surface of silicon. The -OH groups can hydrolyze and subsequently form siloxane linkages (Si-O-Si) with organic silane molecules. Preparation of silicon surfaces for <b>silanization</b> involves the removal of surface contaminants. This can be achieved by using UV-ozone and piranha solution. Piranha solution in particular constitutes quite a harsh treatment that can potentially damage the integrity of the silicon surface. Finlayson-Pitts et al. investigated the effect of certain treatments on silicon and concluded that both the roughness (3-5 Å) and the presence of scattered large particles were preserved after 1 cycle of plasma-treatment. However, the silicon surface was significantly damaged after 30 cycles of treatment with piranha solution or plasma. In both cases, treatment introduced irregularities and large aggregates on the surface (aggregate size > 80 nm), with the effect being more pronounced when piranha was used. In either case, multiple treatments rendered the surface inadequate for deposition of small biomolecules.|$|E
50|$|Solution-phase {{reaction}} {{has historically}} been the method that has been most studied, and a general consensus that has evolved {{with regards to the}} conditions required for the formation of smooth aminosilane films includes the following: (1) an anhydrous solvent such as toluene is required, with a rigidly controlled trace amount of water to regulate the degree of polymerization of aminosilanes at the surface and in solution; (2) formation of oligomers and polymers is favored at higher silane concentrations (>10%); (3) moderate temperatures (60-90 °C) can disrupt non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, leading to fewer silane molecules that are weakly tethered to the surface. Additionally, condition (3) favors desorption of water from the substrate into the toluene phase20; (4) Rinsing with solvents such as toluene, ethanol and water following the <b>silanization</b> reaction favors the removal of weakly bonded silane molecules and the hydrolysis of residual alkoxy linkages in the layer; (5) drying and curing at high temperature (110 °C) favors the formation of siloxane linkages and also converts ammonium ions to the neutral amine, which is more reactive.|$|E
50|$|Mica {{is another}} {{silicate}} that {{is widely used}} as substrate for the deposition of biomolecules. Mica bears a noticeable advantage over silicon because it is molecularly smooth and hence better suited for studies of small, flat molecules. It has a crystalline structure with generic formula KSi3AlO10Al2(OH)2 and contains sheets of octahedral hydroxyl-aluminum sandwiched between two silicon tetrahedral layers. In the silicon layer, one in four silicon atoms is replaced by an aluminum atom, generating a difference in charge that is offset by unbound K+ present in the region between neighboring silicon layers. Muscovite mica is most susceptible to cleavage along the plane located in the potassium layer. When a freshly cleaved mica surface is placed in contact with water, hydrated potassium ions can desorb from the mica surface, leading to a negative charge at the surface. Similar to silicon, the surface of mica does not contain an appreciable density of silanol groups for covalent attachment by silanes. A recent study reported that freshly cleaved mica carries 11% silanol groups, i.e., approximately 1 in 10 silicon atoms bears a hydroxyl group). Although {{it is possible that}} <b>silanization</b> may be carried out using untreated mica, the increased density of surface silanol groups on activated mica can significantly improve covalent attachment of silane molecules to the surface. Mica can be activated by treatment with argon/water plasma, leading to a silanol surface density of 30%. Working with activated surfaces introduces another consideration about the stability of the silanol groups on the activated surfaces. Giasson et al. reported that the silanol groups on freshly cleaved mica that was not subjected to any treatment were found to be more stable under high vacuum compared to the plasma-activated mica: after 64 hrs, surface coverage of the silanol groups for freshly cleaved mica plasma was roughly the same, while surface coverage for activated mica decreased 3-fold to 10%.|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Repair is an {{alternative}} treatment option in many cases to replacement of resin matrix composite restoration. However, aged resin matrix composites have {{a limited number of}} carbon-carbon double bonds to adhere to a new layer of rein. Therefore, surface treatments of the aged resin matrix composite surface prior to repairing could improve the repair bond strength. The objectives of this study were to: 1) To evaluate various surface treatments on shear bond strength of repair between aged and new microhybrid resin matrix composite, and 2) To assess the influence of applying a silane coupling agent after surface treatments. Eighty disk-shaped resin matrix composite specimens were fabricated and thermocycled 5000 times prior to surface treatment. Specimens were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the three surface treatments (n = 20) : 1) Airborne abrasion with 50 μm aluminum oxide, 2) Tribochemical silica coating (CoJet), or 3) Er,Cr:YSGG laser and control group (n = 20). Specimens were cleaned with 35 -percent phosphoric acid, rinsed, and dried. Each group was assigned into two subgroups (n = 10) : a) no <b>silanization,</b> and b) with <b>silanization.</b> Adhesive agent was applied and new resin matrix composite was bonded to each conditioned surface. Bond strength was evaluated by shear test. Data were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA model. The interaction between conditioning and <b>silanization</b> was significant(p = 0. 0163), indicating that comparisons of <b>silanization</b> must be evaluated for each conditioning method, and that comparisons of conditioning methods must be evaluated separately with and without <b>silanization.</b> Airborne particle abrasion showed significantly higher repair bond strength than Er,Cr:YSGG laser without <b>silanization</b> (p < 0. 0001) and with silanization(p = 0. 0002), and higher repair bond strength than the control without <b>silanization</b> (p < 0. 00001) and with <b>silanization</b> (p < 0. 00001). Airborne particle abrasion did not have significantly different in repair bond strength than Tribosilica coating without <b>silanization</b> (p = 0. 70) or with <b>silanization</b> (p = 0. 33). Tribosilica coating had significantly higher repair bond strength than Er,CR:YSGG laser without <b>silanization</b> (p < 0. 0001) and with <b>silanization</b> (p < 0. 0001), and significantly higher repair bond strength than control without <b>silanization</b> (p < 0. 0001), but not with <b>silanization</b> (p = 0. 16). Er,CR:YSGG laser and control did not have significantly different repair bond strength without <b>silanization</b> (p = 1. 00) or with <b>silanization</b> (p = 0. 11). There was no effect of <b>silanization</b> on repair bond strength overall (p = 0. 34) for any of the surface conditioning methods (p = 0. 76 for airborne particle abrasion; p = 0. 39 for tribosilica coating; p = 1. 00 for Er,Cr:YSGG laser, or p = 0. 39 for control). Airborne particle abrasion with 50 -μm aluminum oxide particle and tribochemical silica coating followed by the application of bonding agent provided the highest shear bond strength values, suggesting that they might be adequate methods to improve the quality of the repairs of resin-matrix composites...|$|E
40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: Surface <b>silanization</b> {{of carbon}} nanofibers (CNFs) and {{multi-walled}} nanotubes (MWCNTs) {{was carried out}} to investigate its effect on properties of epoxy composites. Unlike previous researches which worked mainly on the <b>silanization</b> of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), {{the focus of this}} thesis was the <b>silanization</b> of oxygenated CNFs with alkoxysilanes. However, oxygenated MWCNTs were also silanized as a comparison. In the first part, different oxidations were applied on CNFs and MWCNTs to find the optimal condition to introduce carboxyl groups on the surface. Three <b>silanization</b> procedures were performed on oxidized CNFs: 1) 	 direct <b>silanization</b> with 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane 2) first reduction of carboxyl groups on oxidized CNFs into alcoholic hydroxyl groups and then <b>silanization</b> with 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane 3) initially <b>silanization</b> with 3 -isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane and then a further <b>silanization</b> with 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane The procedure 2) was also performed on oxidized MWCNTs. The oxidation as well as the <b>silanization</b> of CNFs and MWCNTs was characterized systematically and explicitly by various analytical methods. In the second part, epoxy nanocomposites with CNFs or MWCNTs were prepared. Silanized CNFs improved the mechanical properties of composites. The electrical conductivity of composites was increased with the addition of fillers, but silanized CNFs/epoxy composites demonstrated smaller increments than original CNFs/epoxy composites due to the insulating silane coating on the CNF surface. <b>Silanization</b> has a greater effect on changing the electrical conductivity of MWCNTs/epoxy composites than CNFs/epoxy composites. The thermal conductivity of epoxy composites was also improved by the infusion of CNFs. Depending on the amount of silanes on CNFs, the thermal conductivity of epoxy composites with silanized CNFs could be higher or lower than that of composites with original CNFs. Epoxy composites with aligned MWCNTs could be prepared under alternating current electric field, which was confirmed by the anisotropy in the electrical conductivity of composites. The <b>silanization</b> of carbon nanofillers provides a facile way to adjust the properties of polymer composites by strengthening the interfacial interaction between fillers and polymer matrices as well as improving the dispersion of fillers in the matrix...|$|E
40|$|<b>Silanization</b> is {{commonly}} used to form bonds between inorganic materials and biomolecules as {{a step in the}} surface preparation of solid-state biosensors. This work investigates the effects of <b>silanization</b> with amino-propyldiethoxymethylsilane on hydroxylated sidewalls of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires (NWs). The surface properties and electrical characteristics of NWs are analyzed by different techniques after their hydroxylation and later <b>silanization.</b> Contact angle measurements reveal a stronger hydrophobic behavior after <b>silanization,</b> and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show a reduction of the surface dipole induced by the replacement of the hydroxyl group with the amine terminal group. The lower work function obtained after <b>silanization</b> in contact potential measurements corroborates the attenuation of the surface dipole observed in XPS. Furthermore, the surface band bending of NWs is determined from surface photovoltage measurements upon irradiation with UV light, yielding a 0. 5 eV energy in hydroxylated NWs, and 0. 18 eV, after <b>silanization.</b> From those results, a reduction in the surface state density of 3. 1 × 1011 cm– 2 is estimated after <b>silanization.</b> The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics measured in a silanized single NW device show a reduction of the resistance, due to the enhancement of the conductive volume inside the NW, which also improves the linearity of the I–V characteristic...|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} post surface pretreatment on the delamination strength of different cements from a prefabricated FRC post tested in a three-point bending test. Methods Three cements were tested; RelyX Unicem, DC Core Automix, and Panavia F 2. 0. Per cement, 40 posts (D. T. Light Post Illusion size 3) were divided into four groups; no pretreatment (control), sandblasting, <b>silanization,</b> and sandblasting followed by <b>silanization.</b> A cement layer {{was applied to the}} posts using a standardized poly-oxy-methacrylate mold. The specimens were subjected to a three-point bending test recording the initial and catastrophic failure loads. Two-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests were used to analyze the differences between the variables. Results At the initial failure load, all specimens demonstrated delamination of the cement layer, therefore initial failure load was defined as delamination strength. With RelyX Unicem, none of the pretreatments showed significant differences. When using Panavia F 2. 0, <b>silanization</b> (735 ± 51 MPa) resulted in higher initial failure values than sandblasting (600 ± 118 MPa). When DC Core Automix was used, <b>silanization</b> (732 ± 144 MPa) produced significantly higher initial failure values than the no pretreatment group (518 ± 115 MPa) and the combined sandblasting and <b>silanization</b> group (560 ± 223 MPa). Two failure types were observed; cohesive and adhesive failure. In the <b>silanization</b> groups, more cohesive failures were observed for all cements tested.

40|$|The {{performance}} of an open-tubular capillary column {{coated with a}} modified silica-gel thin layer was investigated, particularly concerning {{the effect of the}} <b>silanization</b> process on it. Although the increase in the octadecyltriethoxysilane (ODTES) concentration in the <b>silanization</b> process could enhance the retention factor of naphthalene, its theoretical plate number was significantly reduced (ODTES, 5 to 50 %; k, 0. 2 to 4. 3; N, 79600 to 2600 m- 1). Namely, the increase in the retention factor was accompanied by a decrease in the theoretical plate number. A similar phenomenon was also observed when octadecyldimethylchlorosilane (ODCS) was used as the <b>silanization</b> regent. However, increases in both the retention factor and the theoretical plate number could be achieved (sample, naphthalene; k, 0. 05 to 0. 09; N, 149000 to 220000 m- 1) by a NaOH treatment to the fabricated thin porous silica-gel layer before <b>silanization</b> with ODCS.

40|$|In this work, the {{continuous}} compounding process of silica-based rubber compounds with in-situ <b>silanization</b> {{was investigated in}} co-rotating twin screw extruders. In regards to achieving better silica dispersion and {{a high degree of}} <b>silanization</b> as well as the removal of the condensation products from the compounding process, the twin-screw extruder has great advantages {{as an alternative to the}} internal mixer for the preparation of silica compounds. For a simplified recipe, which contains only silica and no carbon black as filler, the question of the completeness of the <b>silanization</b> can be answered positively for the Ø 44 mm extruder. Time and temperature control are the crucial factors in the mixing process. The optimization process is strongly determined by trade-offs. In {{the continuous}} compounding with extruder cascades, complete <b>silanization</b> and good silica dispersion must be ensured. The sequence of compounding stages has a strong influence on the properties of the mixture. It is technologically important that the <b>silanization</b> reaction begins promptly at the start of the mixing process. A complete <b>silanization</b> is the prerequisite for a low viscosity of the silica compound and for the formation of a strong polymer-filler interaction. Shorter residence time, lower energy consumption and comparable mixture properties are the notable advantages of the compounding process in the twin screw extruder. In order to obtain a better understanding of the continuous compounding process, a simulation program, MOREX, is being employed parallel to the extrusion experiments.

40|$|<b>Silanization</b> {{protocols}} for glass {{slides and}} silicon oxide substrates usually include acid rinsing steps {{to activate the}} surfaces prior to <b>silanization.</b> In our group, field-effect transistor devices and electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor structures are used to electronically record signals from cells or to detect biomolecular interactions at the solid-liquid interface. A miniaturized, high sensitive, field-effect-based semiconductor device should expose at its input stage just a thin oxide (< 10 nm) to the electrolyte solution. Therefore, <b>silanization</b> protocols are needed, which do not alter the thin oxide layers in terms of topology changes or thickness loss. In this article we evaluated different protocols for wet cleaning and activation of thin silicon oxides. The efficiency of the cleaning methods was verified with Contact Angle Measurements, Atomic Force Microscopy, and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Furthermore, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy was used to characterize the oxides after the cleaning and <b>silanization</b> procedures.

The three points flexural strength was performed 24  h after cementation and the data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s tests (p-value[*]=[*] 0.05). The results showed that the surface treatment had a significant effect (p-value[*]<[*] 0, 05) on the flexural strength of the studied ceramic.

Materials and Methods: Eighteen blocks (5 x 5 x 4 mm) of indirect resin composite (Sinfony) were fabricated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specimens were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the following two treatment conditions (9 blocks per treatment) : (1) 10 % hydrofluoric acid (HF) for 90 s (Dentsply) + <b>silanization,</b> (2) silica coating with 30 Im SiOx particles (CoJet) + <b>silanization.</b> After surface conditioning, the bonding agent was applied (Adper Single Bond) and light polymerized. The composite resin (W 3 D Master) was condensed and polymerized incrementally to form a block. Following storage in distilled water at 37 degrees C for 24 h, the indirect composite/resin blocks were sectioned in two axes (x and y) with a diamond disk under coolant irrigation to obtain nontrimmed specimens (sticks) with approximately 0. 6 mm(2) of bonding area. Twelve specimens were obtained per block (N = 216, n = 108 sticks). The specimens from each repaired block were again randomly divided into 2 groups and tested either after storage in water for 24 h or thermocycling (6000 cycles, 5 degrees C to 55 degrees C). The microtensile bond strength test was performed in a universal testing machine (crosshead speed: 1 mm/min). The mean bond strengths of the specimens of each block were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA (alpha = 0. 05).

40|$|A novel {{technique}} {{based in}} the combination of vapor <b>silanization</b> and chemical vapor deposition, hereafter referred to as activated vapor <b>silanization</b> (AVS), is shown {{to be an effective}} biofunctionalization technique. The AVS process results in thin organic films with a high surface amine concentration when deposited on substrates with different chemical characteristics, such as silicon, porous silicon, or gold. Chemical characterization shows that the films are composed of carbon (hydrocarbon, C-Si, C-C), silicon (different oxidation states), nitrogen (primary and secondary amines), oxygen, and hydrogen. Relevantly, the arnines are also distributed along the film thickness, ensuring functionality even after some degradation of the films. AVS films behave practically as monocrystalline silicon substrates under loading-unloading tests. In addition, the AVS films behave as permeable membranes for molecules smaller than 5 Å, and the amine surface concentration is estimated to be 8 NH 2 /nm 2 for molecules of about 12 Å, which is three times higher than that obtained with standard <b>silanization</b> procedures. © 2008 Materials Research Society.

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{deals with}} the {{modification}} of the mineral filler based on clinoptilolite by the <b>silanization</b> process and application of prepared modified forms into polymeric materials. Zeolite clinoptilolite is natural aluminosilicate material with the special porous structure belonging to zeolite group. Surface modification of clinoptilolite was performed with 3 -(aminopropyl) triethoxysilane. The influence of <b>silanization</b> conditions – time (1, 2 and 3 hours) and temperature (20 °C and 50 °C) on the efficiency of clinoptilolite modification was studied. Prepared modified fillers were mixed into rubber compounds as partial replacement of commonly used filler – carbon black. Influence of prepared fillers on rheoloy and vulcanizing characteristics of rubber compounds and also on physical and mechanical properties, crosslink density and termooxidative ageing of the vulcanizates was studied. Obtained results of measured characteristics of polymeric systems containing filler based on clinoptilolite were compared with the results obtained {{in the case of}} reference rubber compound with a commercially used filler – carbon black. Based on the results the influence of <b>silanization</b> conditions of clinoptilolite filler on its efficiency in polymeric systems has been determined...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{developed}} to chemically functionalize multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) based on <b>silanization</b> reaction {{for use as}} the reinforcement for polymer matrix composites. To oxidize and create active moieties on the MWCNTs, the samples were exposed to UV light within the ozone chamber, followed by <b>silanization</b> using 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxy silane after the oxidized MWCNTs were reduced by lithium aluminum hydride. FT-IR, TEM and XPS were employed to characterize the changes in carbon nanotubes surface morphology, chemistry and physical conditions at different processing stages. The results indicate improved dispersion and attachment of silane molecules {{on the surface of}} the MWCNTs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the possibility of}} using a simple functionalization procedure, based on an initial vapour-phase <b>silanization,</b> to control the size and functionality of solid state nanopores. The presented results show that, by varying the <b>silanization</b> time, it is possible to modify the efficiency of probe molecule attachment, thus shrinking the pore to the chosen size, while introducing a specific sensing selectivity. The proposed method allows us to tune the nanopore biosensor adapting it to the specific final application, and it can be efficiently applied when the pore initial diameter does not exceed a limit dimension related to the mean free path of the silane molecules at the working pressure...|$|E
40|$|Durable superhydrophobic {{cellulose}} fabric {{was prepared}} from water glass and n-octadecyltriethoxysilane (ODTES) with 3 -glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) as crosslinker by sol-gel method. The result {{showed that the}} addition of GPTMS {{could result in a}} better fixation of silica coating from water glass on cellulose fabric. The <b>silanization</b> of hydrolyzed ODTES at different temperatures and times was studied and optimized. The results showed that <b>silanization</b> time was more important than temperature in forming durable hydrophobic surface. The durability of superhydrophobicity treatment was analyzed by XPS. As a result, the superhydrophobic cotton treated under the optimal condition still remained hydrophobic properties after 50 washing cycles. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

The {{application of}} ceramic materials in fixed dental prostheses and restorations have become increasingly popular because they mimic natural tooth color in comparison to other restorative materials. Zirconium oxide (zirconia) demonstrates superior mechanical properties, chemical stability, and biocompatibility compared to other ceramic materials being applied in framework structures Etching with hydrofluoric acid and <b>silanization</b> are effective methods to bond silica-based ceramic materials). However, etching with hydrofluoric acid or <b>silanization</b> have no {{positive effect on the}} properties of zirconia because of their resistance to acids and absence of silicon oxide. Researchers have therefore proposed a number of surface conditioning methods to achieve reliable and durable bonding to zirconia over the past two decades. The representative materials and methods are airborne-particle abrasion with aluminum oxide particles (alumina blasting) airborne-particle abrasion with aluminum oxide modified with silica (silica-coating) followed by <b>silanization,</b> primers containing 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP) luting agents containing MDP, selective infiltration-etching, and coating with nano-structured alumina The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of mechanochemical surface preparation on the bond strength of a self-polymerizing acrylic resin bonded to zirconia.
