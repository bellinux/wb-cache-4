5|$|In {{the hype}} {{that led to}} their game against the Central Michigan Chippewas, the press billed the contest as the de facto MAC {{championship}} game. At Mount Pleasant, the Rockets failed to score a touchdown and suffered their first loss {{of the season in}} a 13–12 loss. The Rockets scored first on a 28-yard Rusty Hanna field goal, but the Chippewas responded with a 53-yard Jeff Bender touchdown pass to Ken Ealy to take a 7–3 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter. A 46-yard Hanna field goal in the <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> the Central lead to 7–6 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|While {{the video}} was filmed {{as a single}} shot on at least three {{different}} occasions, they planned on using post-editing to slow down or speed up {{certain parts of the}} take to keep it in time with the final soundtrack. There is a noted cut in the video, in which the camera passes through a set of curtains on the transition to the downstairs portion of the machine; according to one of the machine designers, Hector Alvarez, this cut was introduced by the band, speculating it was introduced to avoid a shot of one of the band members or cameraman in frame or otherwise to keep the machine video synchronized to the machine. Both Tim Nordwind, bassist for the band, and Adam Sadowsky, president of Syyn Labs, said that while the machine worked in its entirety 3 times, and no cut was needed, the decision was made so a better result on the downstairs portion could be included in the final version. There was also a <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> which can be noticed by watching a piano against a wall as the camera passed behind some rods; the piano can be seen apparently warping in shape and position.|$|E
25|$|For example, one switch {{might send}} {{only the last}} four or five digits of a {{telephone}} number. In one case, seven digit numbers were preceded by a digit 1 or 2 to differentiate between two area codes or office codes, (a two-digit-per-call savings). This improved revenue per trunk and reduced the number of digit receivers needed in a switch. Every task in electromechanical switches was done in big metallic pieces of hardware. Every fractional <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> off of call set up time meant fewer racks of equipment to handle call traffic.|$|E

500|$|After {{being formed}} and {{finishing}} {{third in the}} seventh series of The X Factor in 2010, One Direction were signed to Syco Music. The number was written by August Rigo and Steve Mac, and was produced by Mac. One Direction premiered the single on BBC Radio 1 on 19 October 2011, with confirmation that it would serve as the <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> from Up All Night, following their debut single, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", which topped the UK Singles Chart in September of that year. Member Zayn Malik, in an October interview with Digital Spy, characterised [...] "Gotta Be You" [...] as [...] "a bit more emotive" [...] than their debut single. It was released by Syco Music via digital download in Ireland and United Kingdom on 11 November 2011 and 13 November, respectively. In both countries, the digital download contains the principal recording, its B-side, [...] "Another World", and two remixes of the song itself.|$|E
500|$|The Great Recession of {{the late}} 2000s and {{subsequent}} loss of an estimated $180 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) in sales tax revenue in Snohomish County forced CT to cut service by 15 percent in June 2010, including {{the elimination of all}} service on Sundays and major holidays, to save $16 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) until 2012. A <b>second</b> <b>cut,</b> with 20 percent of service eliminated, took place in February 2012; the CT Board rejected a major restructure that would have truncated its northern and eastern express service to Seattle at Lynnwood Transit Center during this cut, instead opting to preserve its commuter service. Despite the decline in service hours, Community Transit and Sound Transit had record ridership for Snohomish County routes during the Super Bowl XLVIII parade in Downtown Seattle in February 2014, carrying a total of 22,500 passengers on 50 extra trips into Seattle. In March, the 2014 Oso mudslide destroyed a portion of State Route 530 and forced CT to re-route its service to Darrington through Skagit County, offering one-seat service to Smokey Point and Everett Station in the interim as Route 231. The partial reopening of State Route 530 in June and full reopening in September restored the original Route 230 on its original route, now extended to Smokey Point.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{certain about}} the second single either, [...] "Keep Givin' Me Your Love" [...] was {{accepted}} to become the British follow-up. But the track, remixed by Eddie Gordon's West End production team, had no supporting music video, and after peaking at No. 36 in April in the United Kingdom, an alternative title ("I'm Not Over You") was chosen for the US market as the <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> from the Thought 'Ya Knew album.|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} {{responded with}} the PV Act (2010) which entered into force retrospectively {{with effect from}} 1July 2010. [...] The legislation introduced a dramatic reduction in photovoltaic tariffs, cutting these between 8 and 13% depending on the installation type, followed by a <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> of 3%. [...] The deployment corridor was doubled to between 2500 and 3500MWp, along with tighter growth-dependant degression rates of 1–12%, {{in addition to the}} ordinary degression of 9%. [...] The self-consumption incentive was significantly raised to around 8¢/kWh and eligibility extended to systems up to 500kWp. [...] The feed-in rate itself was dependent on the system size and the proportion of demand that was consumed on-site. [...] Free-standing systems were excluded from using agricultural land.|$|E
2500|$|The {{contour mining}} method {{consists}} of removing overburden from the seam {{in a pattern}} following the contours along a ridge or around the hillside. This method is most commonly used in areas with rolling to steep terrain. It was once common to deposit the spoil on the downslope side of the bench thus created, but this method of spoil disposal consumed much additional land and created severe landslide and erosion problems. To alleviate these problems, {{a variety of methods}} were devised to use freshly cut overburden to refill mined-out areas. These haul-back or lateral movement methods generally consist of an initial cut with the spoil deposited downslope or at some other site and spoil from the <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> refilling the first. A ridge of undisturbed natural material [...] wide is often intentionally left at {{the outer edge of the}} mined area. This barrier adds stability to the reclaimed slope by preventing spoil from slumping or sliding downhill ...|$|E
2500|$|Rose {{mentioned}} in a 1999 {{interview that the}} band recorded enough material for a double album. He also mentioned recording sessions for Chinese Democracy resulted in [...] "several albums" [...] worth of material, including an album that is [...] "more industrial and electronica-influenced than Chinese Democracy". Sebastian Bach backed up this claim, stating that Chinese Democracy {{was to be the}} first in a trilogy of albums. Early in the recording process, the band was said to have 60 songs in development. Sources claimed the band's initial plans in 2001 were to record two albums, release Chinese Democracy, tour for a year or two, then release the second album without having to return to the studio. Rose said in 2006 that the band had 32 songs in development at the time as well as confirming the working titles of 10 songs in 2008. Guitarist Ron [...] "Bumblefoot" [...] Thal stated in 2013 that an unreleased song [...] "Atlas Shrugged" [...] was a last <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> from the album due to time constraints with compact discs. In a June 2014 interview, Rose stated a 'second part' of Chinese Democracy and a remix album of songs from the album were done and pending release.|$|E

6000|$|Later in the day, he chanced upon another stray chicken {{near the}} stables. One of the grooms {{ran to the}} rescue. He did not know White Fang's breed, so for weapon he took a light buggy-whip. At the first cut of the whip, White Fang left the chicken for the man. A club might have stopped White Fang, but not a whip. Silently, without flinching, he took a <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> in his forward rush, and as he leaped for the throat the groom cried out, [...] "My God!" [...] and {{staggered}} backward.

60|$|Fort Pemberton was {{so little}} {{above the water}} that {{it was thought that}} a rise of two feet would drive the enemy out. In hope of enlisting the {{elements}} on our side, which had been so much against us up to this time, a <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> was made in the Mississippi levee, this time directly opposite Helena, or six miles above the former cut. It did not accomplish the desired result, and Ross, with his fleet, started back. On the 22d he met Quinby with a brigade at Yazoo Pass. Quinby was the senior of Ross, and assumed command. He was not satisfied with returning to his former position without seeing for himself whether anything could be accomplished. Accordingly Fort Pemberton was revisited by our troops; but an inspection was sufficient this time without an attack. Quinby, with his command, returned with but little delay. In the meantime I was much exercised for the safety of Ross, not knowing that Quinby had been able to join him. Reinforcements were of no use in a country covered with water, as they would have to remain on board of their transports. Relief had to come from another quarter. So I determined to get into the Yazoo below Fort Pemberton.|$|E
60|$|The Lady of Avenel, {{instantly}} {{taking the}} alarm, called hastily to the attendants {{to get the}} boat ready. But this was an affair of some time. The only boat permitted to be used on the lake, was moored within the <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> which intersected the canal, and it was several minutes ere it could be unmoored and got under way. Meantime, the Lady of Avenel, with agonizing anxiety, saw that the efforts that the poor boy made to keep himself afloat, were now exchanged for a faint struggling, which would soon have been over, but for aid equally prompt and unhoped-for. Wolf, who, like some of that large species of greyhound, was a practised water-dog, had marked the object of her anxiety, and, quitting his mistress's side, had sought the nearest point from which he could with safety plunge into the lake. With the wonderful instinct which these noble animals have so often displayed in the like circumstances, he swam straight {{to the spot where}} his assistance was so much wanted, and seizing the child's under-dress in his mouth, he not only kept him afloat, but towed him towards the causeway. The boat having put off with a couple of men, met the dog half-way, and relieved him of his burden. They landed on the causeway, close by the gates of the castle, with their yet lifeless charge, and were there met by the Lady of Avenel, attended by one or two of her maidens, eagerly waiting to administer assistance to the sufferer.|$|E

60|$|When Miss Woolford, and the horse, and the orchestra, {{all stop}} {{together}} to take breath, he urbanely takes part in some such dialogue {{as the following}} (commenced by the clown): ‘I say, sir!’—‘Well, sir?’ (it’s always conducted in the politest manner.)—‘Did you ever happen to hear I was in the army, sir?’—‘No, sir.’—‘Oh, yes, sir—I can go through my exercise, sir.’—‘Indeed, sir!’—‘Shall I do it now, sir?’—‘If you please, sir; come, sir—make haste’ (a cut with the long whip, and ‘Ha’ done now—I don’t like it,’ from the clown). Here the clown throws himself on the ground, and goes {{through a variety of}} gymnastic convulsions, doubling himself up, and untying himself again, and making himself look very like a man in the most hopeless extreme of human agony, to the vociferous delight of the gallery, until he is interrupted by a <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> from the long whip, and a request to see ‘what Miss Woolford’s stopping for?’ On which, to the inexpressible mirth of the gallery, he exclaims, ‘Now, Miss Woolford, what can I come for to go, for to fetch, for to bring, for to carry, for to do, for you, ma’am?’ On the lady’s announcing with a sweet smile that she wants the two flags, they are, with sundry grimaces, procured and handed up; the clown facetiously observing after the performance of the latter ceremony—‘He, he, oh! I say, sir, Miss Woolford knows me; she smiled at me.’ Another cut from the whip, a burst from the orchestra, a start from the horse, and round goes Miss Woolford again on her graceful performance, to the delight of every member of the audience, young or old. The next pause affords an opportunity for similar witticisms, the only additional fun being that of the clown making ludicrous grimaces at the riding-master every time his back is turned; and finally quitting the circle by jumping over his head, having previously directed his attention another way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ellen, it's {{a mighty}} queer story--too queer to be a lie," [...] went on Sprague. [...] "Now you listen! Evarts got this from Ted Meeker. An' Ted Meeker heerd it from Greaves, who didn't die till {{the next day}} after Jean Isbel knifed him. An' your dad shot Ted fer tellin' what he heerd.... No, Greaves wasn't killed outright. He was cut somethin' turrible--in two places. They wrapped him all up an' next day packed him in a wagon back to Grass Valley. Evarts says Ted Meeker was {{friendly}} with Greaves an' {{went to see him}} as he was layin' in his room next to the store. Wal, accordin' to Meeker's story, Greaves came to an' talked. He said he was sittin' there in the dark, shootin' occasionally at Isbel's cabin, when he heerd a rustle behind him in the grass. He knowed some one was crawlin' on him. But before he could get his gun around he was jumped by {{what he thought was a}} grizzly bear. But it was a man. He shut off Greaves's wind an' dragged him back in the ditch. An' he said: 'Greaves, it's the half-breed. An' he's goin' to cut you--FIRST FOR ELLEN JORTH! an' then for Gaston Isbel!' ... Greaves said Jean ripped him with a bowie knife.... An' thet was all Greaves remembered. He died soon after tellin' this story. He must hev fought awful hard. Thet <b>second</b> <b>cut</b> Isbel gave him went clear through him.... Some of the gang was thar when Greaves talked, an' naturally they wondered why Jean Isbel had said 'first for Ellen Jorth.' ... Somebody remembered thet Greaves had cast a slur on your good name, Ellen. An' then they had Jean Isbel's reason fer sayin' thet to Greaves. It caused a lot of talk. An' when Simm Bruce busted in some of the gang haw-hawed him an' said as how he'd get the third cut from Jean Isbel's bowie. Bruce was half drunk an' he began to cuss an' rave about Jean Isbel bein' in love with his girl.... As bad luck would have it, a couple of more fellars come in an' asked Meeker questions. He jest got to thet part, 'Greaves, it's the half-breed, an' he's goin' to cut you--FIRST FOR ELLEN JORTH,' when in walked your father! ... Then it all had to come out--what Jean Isbel had said an' done--an' why. How Greaves had backed Simm Bruce in slurrin' you!" ...|$|E
