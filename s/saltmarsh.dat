40|$|During {{periods of}} silica limitation, its supply from tidal marshes is {{important}} for the stability of estuarine and coastal food webs. <b>Saltmarshes</b> are highly dynamic, grass dominated ecosystems: their large area, high salinity and location imply that they could efficiently contribute to the buffering of silica depletion events in the coastal zone. As grazing management potentially alters vegetation and sedimentation dynamics in <b>saltmarshes,</b> it could have an indirect impact on silica cycling in these systems. In two <b>saltmarshes</b> of the Wadden Sea coast, concentrations of dissolved and biogenic silica (DSi and BSi) were measured in eight creeks in four seasons under different management conditions. Export rates were calculated using simultaneous discharge measurements. Mean annual DSi concentration in the seepage water was 338  ±  112  µmol l - 1. Ungrazed sites had significantly higher seepage water DSi concentrations than sites which were grazed by sheep. BSi concentrations were, in general, lower and more variable. DSi export rates from ungrazed sites (265  ±  155  µmol m - 2  day - 1) were twice as high as from grazed <b>saltmarshes</b> (126  ±  137  µmol m - 2  day - 1). DSi concentrations were among the highest values previously reported for <b>saltmarshes</b> and tidal freshwater marshes. Although differences in silica exports from grazed and ungrazed sites might be partly explained by silica uptake of benthic diatoms in the creeks, differences in hydrology appeared to be an overarching factor, controlling silica exports from Wadden Sea <b>saltmarshes...</b>|$|R
5|$|St Kilda is {{adjacent}} to the mangrove forest bordering Barker Inlet, part of the largest tidal estuary of Gulf St Vincent. Late in the 19th Century embankments were constructed through the mangroves {{in an effort to}} reclaim land for pasturing. With the construction of the banks of the adjacent saltfields maintenance of the embankments ceased and the mangroves began to reclaim them. One of these embankments is used as the beginning of a boardwalk through the mangroves which forms a 1.7km loop through the samphire <b>saltmarsh</b> flats and mangroves reaching the border between the ocean and forest.|$|E
5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and <b>saltmarsh.</b> The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by <b>saltmarsh</b> rush, sea club-rush, sea aster and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck, knot, redshank, great crested grebe, teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this gannet, Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the solan goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, eider duck and numerous gulls.|$|E
5|$|The boardwalk {{is within}} the barker inlet aquatic reserve, where the taking of crabs {{shellfish}} and plants is prohibited and pets are not allowed.

40|$|<b>Saltmarshes</b> {{are one of}} {{the coastal}} {{ecosystems}} that have endured higher anthropogenic pressures and consequent transformations over the centuries. Its privileged position in transition areas between land and sea (estuaries) has placed these ecosystems at the run for urban-industrial growth and agricultural development. Thus, Ria de Alvor <b>saltmarshes</b> were no exception regarding land use changes, which were mainly driven through the works undertaken by the Development Plans (1940 - 60). These incorporated saltmarshes´ reclamation for agriculture by exsiccation and the destruction of vegetation, and also building a small wall to prevent salt water to enter (dykedland), leading to the disappearance of about 60 % of the Ria de Alvor <b>saltmarshes</b> between 1958 and 2010. However, this process provided the opportunity to new types of marshland to emerge, resulting from the implementation failure of the agricultural dykedland in the Ria de Alvor mouth. The controlled and secondary <b>saltmarshes</b> developed as new typologies of this ecosystem that deserve special attention with regard to habitat management, since they can be differentiated from natural marshes by their structure and floristic compositio...|$|R
5|$|At Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton {{the wooded}} cliff and a narrow salt marsh are {{supported}} by rocks of Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone, overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate. The site's principal interest {{and the reason for}} its designation as an SSSI is the presence of a population of the True Service-tree (Sorbus domestica) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of Sorbus here are the whitebeams Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, and herbs include Field garlic (Allium oleraceum) and Pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum). The <b>saltmarsh</b> vegetation, which lies {{at the base of the}} cliff, is predominantly made up of Sea Aster (Aster tripolium) and English Scurvygrass (Cochlearia anglica).

5|$|Selworthy is a {{small village}} and civil parish which {{includes}} the hamlets of Bossington, Tivington, Lynch, Brandish Street and Allerford. Bossington is separated from Porlock Bay by a shingle beach, through which flows the River Horner, forming part of the Porlock Ridge and <b>Saltmarsh</b> Site of Special Scientific Interest. In the 1990s rising sea levels created salt marshes, and lagoons developed in the area behind the boulder bank. The village is on the South West Coast Path. Selworthy was rebuilt as a model village, to provide housing for the aged and infirm of the Holnicote estate, in 1828 by Sir Thomas Acland. Many of the other cottages, {{some of which are}} now rented out, are still thatched and are listed buildings, whose walls are painted with limewash that has been tinted creamy yellow with ochre. On the hill above the village is the whitewashed 15th-century Church of All Saints, with a 14th-century tower. One of Allerford's main attractions is the much-photographed packhorse bridge. Built as a crossing over the River Aller (from which the village gets its name), it is thought to be medieval in origin. The village is also home to Allerford House, childhood home of Admiral John Moresby, who explored the coastline of New Guinea and for whom Port Moresby, the capital city of Papua New Guinea, was named. Other features of the village include thatched cottages, a forge and an old-fashioned red telephone box. There is also a Reading Room, built by the Acland family to foster adult education. One of the thatched cottages operated as the local Primary School between 1821 and 1981 and is now a museum containing the West Somerset Rural Life Museum and Victorian School. The museum houses the West Somerset Photographic Archive.|$|E

40|$|Lateral {{erosion of}} <b>saltmarshes</b> is {{affected}} by many abiotic and biotic factors. While abiotic factors are typically regarded as primary drivers of erosion, biotic influences such as burrowing or bioturbating taxa can also extensively modify the physical structure of this marine habitat. Many estuaries on the Pacific coast of North America have been invaded by populations of the burrowing non-native isopod Sphaeroma quoianum, which are thought to exacerbate the erosion of <b>saltmarshes.</b> We conducted a mensurative experiment {{to examine the relationship}} between populations of S. quoianum and lateral erosion rate of <b>saltmarshes</b> in Coos Bay, Oregon, USA. After 1 yr, we measured higher lateral erosion rates, more undercutting, and higher numbers of calved and slumped marsh sections in marsh sites infested by S. quoianum than in uninfested sites. This effect was also consistent at smaller spatial scales: we found lateral erosion was 300 % higher in burrowed areas than in adjacent (within approx. 1 m) unburrowed areas within infested sites. Our results suggest that the prodigious burrowing by dense populations of S. quoianum can accelerate erosion rates in <b>saltmarshes</b> and are substantial geomorphic agents of change in estuaries on the Pacific coast of North America...|$|R
