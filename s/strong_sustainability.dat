Furthermore, an empirical methodology ispresented in order to compute land surplus values. Conclusions are drawn concerningthe implications of this analysis for regional and urban planning.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} to what extent Canada and Alberta have been fulfilling the principles of sustainable development as they have adopted in the 1990 s from the essential U.

I assessed this level of sustainability in Canada and Alberta {{on the basis of a}} <b>stronger</b> and weaker <b>sustainability</b> theoretical framework. Author's presumption was that Canada, as it defined sustainable development in its legislation, acted according to <b>stronger</b> <b>sustainability,</b> which emphasizes <b>stronger</b> protective environmental measures. Given a very large scope of environmental impacts of oil extraction on different ecosystems, the sector of water resources was selected to serve as a case study to compare and analyze government and alternative reports assessing the sustainability of water management. Thus, the author follows how the oil industry in Alberta affects the water resources and how both governments of Canada and Alberta provide environmental protection to the water resources. In this respect the author illustrates how the government is reluctant towards the implementation of [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Difficulties in {{assessing}} sustainability {{start from the}} very beginning – what is sustainable and how to define sustainability? After considering some definitions of sustainability, their measurements and fair evaluation of the impacts and preferences introduce further uncertainties to assessments. In the end, unknowns are inherent in any assessment since “perfect” data is never available. Uncertainties are unavoidable and they should be taken into account prior to making any decisions. With careful planning and good system-level understanding, it is possible to minimize the risks of negative impacts due to misjudgments. One could argue that the more we pursue “perfect” knowledge before making a decision, the more we make decision-making impossible. Thus, we should act towards <b>stronger</b> <b>sustainability</b> and think that any action towards a higher level of sustainability is always better than continuing on a path already known to be unsustainable.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{stresses}} {{how important}} knowledge {{of land and}} real estate values and their interdependencies, their underlying variables and valuation processes, the relations between rural and urban land, temporal perspectives of land use changes, as well as behaviour of agents involved in development processes are for successful regional and urban planning. It specifically focuses on the importance to control surplus-values generation and assure its fair distribution {{on behalf of the}} society in general, thus avoiding land speculation. Within this scope, it is proposed and developed a methodology for the evaluation and computation of surplus-values that is applied, as a case study, to the office market in Oporto city (Portugal), despite it can be easily generalised to other property realities. Furthermore, inferences and conclusions are drawn concerning the implications of this analysis for regional and urban planning, especially at the fiscal level. This methodology is expected to support better planning decisions concerning a balanced rural-urban development, thus fuelling a <b>stronger</b> <b>sustainability</b> of rural areas...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of the range of construction types found across Europe to meet various sound insulation requirements for separating (party) walls and floors. The typical construction system, material properties and key influencing factors are described. The historic nature of sound insulation regulations in each country has led to developments in improvements to the types of constructions. More recently with the advent of <b>stronger</b> <b>sustainability</b> measures and resource efficiency of materials many countries have seen an increase in the use of light-weight structures, such as using timber frame. The chapter provides details on typical performances for a variety of acoustic descriptors and is a useful reference chapter for architects, acousticians, house-builders, researchers and government departments or local authorities dealing with building standards for sound insulation in housing. Detailed information on acoustic performance of typical building solutions found all around Europe, can be found in volume 2 of this e book, where the 29 European COST TU 0901 countries (plus Australia and New Zealand) have included a specific chapter, which will be referred to as “Country Chapters” hereinafte...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept has}} become {{confused}} as each discipline {{has tried to}} mold the concept to their set of tools. This “silo” thinking inhibits the kind of policy integration {{that is needed to}} develop a sustainable urban transport solution strategy. There remains much confusion as to what a sustainable transport system would comprise. It is helpful therefore to consider different approaches to sustainable transport along a spectrum of viewpoints, ranging from weak to <b>strong</b> <b>sustainability.</b> Generally efforts to address the impact of transport on climate change to date have been largely focused on technology. The impact of this technological-led approach has been very limited in the transport sector.

40|$|The {{island of}} Sicily {{has a long}} {{standing}} tradition in citrus growing. We evaluated the sustainability of orange and lemon orchards, under organic and conventional farming, using an energy, environmental and economic analysis of the whole production cycle by using a life cycle assessment approach. These orchard systems differ {{only in terms of}} a few of the inputs used and the duration of the various agricultural operations. The quantity of energy consumption in the production cycle was calculated by multiplying the quantity of inputs used by the energy conversion factors drawn from the literature. The production costs were calculated considering all internal costs, including equipment, materials, wages, and costs of working capital. The performance of the two systems (organic and conventional), was compared over a period of fifty years. The results, based on unit surface area (ha) production, prove the <b>stronger</b> <b>sustainability</b> of the organic over the conventional system, both in terms of energy consumption and environmental impact, especially for lemons. The sustainability of organic systems is mainly due to the use of environmentally friendly crop inputs (fertilizers, not use of synthetic products, etc.). In terms of production costs, the conventional management systems were more expensive, and both systems were heavily influenced by wages. In terms of kg of final product, the organic production system showed better environmental and energy performances...|$|R
