25|$|Precipitation is the {{formation}} of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction. It usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the <b>solubility</b> <b>limit</b> and forms an insoluble salt. This process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by removal of the solvent. Rapid precipitation results in an amorphous or microcrystalline residue and slow process can yield single crystals. The latter can also be obtained by recrystallization from microcrystalline salts.|$|E
500|$|Rhenium {{improves}} {{the properties of}} tungsten. Tungsten-rhenium alloys are more ductile at low temperature, allowing {{them to be more}} easily machined. [...] The high-temperature stability is also improved. The effect increases with the rhenium concentration, and therefore tungsten alloys are produced with up to 27% of Re, which is the <b>solubility</b> <b>limit.</b> Tungsten-rhenium wire was originally created in efforts to develop a wire that was more ductile after recrystallization. This allows the wire to meet specific performance objectives, including superior vibration resistance, improved ductility, and higher resistivity. One application for the tungsten-rhenium alloys is X-ray sources. The high melting point of both compounds, together with the high atomic mass, makes them stable against the prolonged electron impact. Rhenium tungsten alloys are also applied as thermocouples to measure temperatures up to 2200 °C.|$|E

At low concentrations of hydrogen, below the solid <b>solubility</b> <b>limit,</b> stress-assisted hydride formation causes the embrittlement which {{is enhanced by}} slow straining. At hydrogen concentrations above the <b>solubility</b> <b>limit,</b> brittle hydrides are precipitated on slip planes and cause severe embrittlement.

40|$|The Performance Assessment for the LANL Low-Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW) Disposal Facility, Area G, is on-going. A {{detailed}} {{review of}} the inventory data base records and the existing models for source release {{led to the development}} of a new modeling capability to describe the liquid phase aqueous transport from the waste package volumes. Inventory is sorted into four release form categories and screened in a comparison of leachate concentrations to the drinking water limit. Percolation through the disposal unit is prescribed in an independent surface water balance model incorporating site rainfall statistics. Waste package types and the disposal unit matrix have independently specified <b>solubility</b> <b>limits</b> and solid-liquid phase partition coefficients, or Kd values. Analytic solutions for inventory limited release of each nuclide in each of the four different waste package release forms are computed. Isotopic contributions are summed over elements to limit the waste package liquid phase concentrations to the elemental <b>solubility</b> <b>limits.</b> Time dependent releases from the waste packages for each nuclide which may be inventory or <b>solubility</b> <b>limited</b> are specified as model output which is provided as the source term to the unsaturated transport model. The waste package efflux is distributed over the 2 -D unsaturated zone model grid points corresponding to the cross-sections for 5 representative disposal units within the mesa top. Results show the Area G release is dominated by the inventory in the rapid release waste form (Kd = 0), which percolates from the waste packages over 5 [...] 100 years and from the disposal unit over 50 [...] 1, 000 years. Nuclides in waste package categories with larger Kd values are released proportionately slower.

The scope of this analysis is to produce <b>solubility</b> <b>limits</b> as functions, distributions, or constants for all transported radioactive elements identified by the Performance Assessment Operations (PAO) radioisotope screening. Results from an expert elicitation for <b>solubility</b> <b>limits</b> of most radioactive elements were used in the previous Total System Performance Assessments (TSPAs). However, the elicitation conducted in 1993 does not meet the criteria set forth by the U. S.

WPO/NEPO is to develop process-level solubility models, including review and compilation of relevant thermodynamic data.

When the limit of stability of the supersaturation is reached, the precipitate forms, and a clear region forms ahead of the diffusion front because the precipitate that is below the <b>solubility</b> <b>limit</b> diffuses onto the precipitate.
