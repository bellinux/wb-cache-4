60|$|All winter {{long the}} lumbermen had chopped their fire-wood {{on the same}} spot, using axes only, and making an {{enormous}} amount of chips and rubbish. When heavy snows fell, instead of clearing it away, they simply cut more wood on top of it, tramping the snow beneath into a solid mass and covering it over with fresh chips. So the pile grew,--first a layer of chips, then a thick blanket of snow, then more chips and snow again,--growing bigger and bigger until in April the lumbermen locked their shanty and went out on the <b>spring</b> <b>drive</b> of logs.|$|E

My folks lived tew Bethel; {{there was}} only the old man, and Aunt Siloam, keepin' house fer him, seein' as I was the only chick he hed. I hedn't heared from 'em fer a long spell, when there come a letter sayin' the old man was breakin' up. He'd said it every spring fer a number er years, and I didn't mind it no more'n the breakin' up er the river; not so much jest then; fer the gret <b>spring</b> <b>drive</b> was comin' on, and my hands was tew full to quit work all tew oncet. I sent word I'd be 'long fore a gret while, and bymeby I went. I ought tew hev gone at fust; but they'd sung aout 'Wolf!' so often I wasn't scared; an' sure 'nuff the wolf did come at last. Father hed been dead an' berried a week when I got there, and aunt was so mad she wouldn't write, nor scurcely speak tew me fer a consider'ble spell. I didn't blame her a mite, and felt jest the wust kind; so I give in every way, and fetched her raound. Yeou see I hed a cousin who'd kind er took my place tew hum while I was off, an' the old man hed left him a good slice er his money, an' me the farm, hopin' to keep me there. He'd never liked the lumberin' bizness, an' hankered arfter me a sight, I faound. Waal, seein' haow 'twas, I tried tew please him, late as it was; but ef there was ennything I did spleen ag'inst, it was farmin, 'specially arfter the smart times I'd ben hevin, up Oldtaown way. Yeou don't know nothin' abaout it; but ef yeou want tew see high dewin's, jest hitch onto a timber-drive an' go it daown along them lakes and rivers, say from Kaumchenungamooth tew Punnobscot Bay. Guess yeou'd see a thing or tew, an' find livin' on a log come as handy as ef yeou was born a turtle.|$|E

50|$|Seiko's {{efforts to}} combine the quartz and {{mechanical}} movements bore fruit after 20 years of research, leading {{to the introduction of}} the Seiko <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive,</b> first in a limited domestic market production in 1999 and to the world in September 2005. The <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive</b> keeps time within quartz standards without the use of a battery, using a traditional mechanical gear train powered by a spring, without the need for a balance wheel either.|$|E

50|$|Before Poplar Springs Road (now Poplar <b>Springs</b> <b>Drive)</b> was a street, it was {{a cattle}} trail.

This is the reason that the street doesn't follow the same layout pattern {{as the rest of the}} city; the cattle's path gives the street its curvy shape.|$|R

5000|$|The {{movement}} uses a mainspring as {{a source}} of energy and transmits it through gear train just like a traditional mechanical watch, but instead of an escapement and balance wheel, Seiko used the newly developed [...] "Tri-synchro regulator", which acts like a quartz movement. The Tri-synchro regulator has three main function: controlling the mechanical energy of the mainspring, generate electricity for the low consumption (~25 nanowatts) quartz crystal oscillator and generate a magnetic force to regulate the glide wheel. By replacing the traditional escapement with magnetic brake, the <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive</b> operates with lower noise and present a glide motion hand that shows continuous flow of time. The <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive</b> movement was also used {{as the basis for the}} first ever watch designed to be worn by an astronaut during a space walk, the aptly named Seiko <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive</b> Spacewalk.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{neighborhood}} was developed by 1912, but one remaining parcel was a 12 acre bell-shaped tract, {{the site of the}} original mansion, which had been converted to a school.

The <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive</b> mansions, recognizable by their 200 ft front yards, are perched atop large hills.

50|$|There are 13 known {{different}} US {{versions of}} the VertiBird playsets.

50|$|MD 62 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with unsigned MD 804 in Chewsville. MD 804, the old alignment of MD 64 (Jefferson Boulevard), heads southwest as Trackside Drive to an intersection with MD 64 and east as Twin <b>Springs</b> <b>Drive</b> {{through the center}} of Chewsville. MD 62 heads west as two-lane Twin <b>Springs</b> <b>Drive</b> and immediately crosses CSX's Hanover Subdivision. The state highway heads west until it reaches Little Antietam Road, onto which the state highway turns northeast. MD 62 passes through a mix of farmland, forest, and scattered residences and veers north at Old Forge Road. The state highway passes the Good-Hartle Farm just before crossing Little Antietam Creek a short distance east of its confluence with Antietam Creek. MD 62 continues to its northern terminus at MD 60 (Leitersburg Pike) just west of Leitersburg.|$|R

50|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>Drive</b> uses a mainspring, barrel, {{automatic}} winder {{and stem}} winding {{like in a}} mechanical watch to store the watch energy. The conventional escapement is replaced with a device that Seiko calls a Tri-synchro Regulator to regulate the unwinding of the mainspring. The regulator controls {{the use of the}} three forms of energy used in the <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive</b> mechanism; the mechanical power of the mainspring, the electrical energy generated from this mechanical power, and the electromagnetic energy that governs the rotation of the glide wheel. The energy produced by the glide wheel is used to power a control circuit and quartz crystal oscillator, which in turn regulates the electro-mechanical braking of the glide wheel.|$|E
