25|$|In March 2011, the East <b>Stand</b> <b>Development</b> began {{phase one}} of a five phase {{redevelopment}} project which included an extension to the East Stand Upper's main concourse along {{with the addition of}} 25 executive boxes and a modern upgrade to the external appearance of the stand; whilst this created extra corporate facilities and more room on the concourse, it in-turn reduced the East Stand Upper's capacity by around 2,500 seats, thus leaving the overall capacity of the ground to stand at just under 38,000 seats. An arcade, hotel and megastore were planned to be built as part of the four further phases, however these plans did not take place following the sale of the club to GFH Capital who then sold the club to Massimo Cellino.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, it was {{reported}} that United continued to harbour plans to increase the capacity of the stadium further, with the next stage pointing to a redevelopment of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, which, unlike the rest of the stadium, remains single tier. A replication of the Sir Alex Ferguson <b>Stand</b> <b>development</b> and North-East and North-West Quadrants would see the stadium's capacity rise to an estimated 95,000, which would give it a greater capacity than Wembley Stadium (90,000). Any such development is likely to cost around £100million, due to the proximity of the railway line that runs adjacent to the stadium, and the corresponding need to build over it and thus purchase up to 50 houses {{on the other side of}} the railway. Nevertheless, the Manchester United group property manager confirmed that expansion plans are in the pipeline – linked to profits made from the club's property holdings around Manchester – saying [...] "There is a strategic plan for the stadium... It is not our intention to stand still". One criticism of the plans, however, is that increasing the height of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand would further reduce the amount of light coming onto the pitch, which has caused problems in similarly large stadia – such as Wembley Stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and the San Siro; according to Alex Ferguson, the developments on the other stands have already caused problems. It was also suggested that, should such an expansion take place, Old Trafford could be used instead of Wembley for big matches such as England internationals – in order to increase the ability of fans in the north of the country to watch England play; and FA Cup semi-finals – to maintain the prestige of the national stadium for the final.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stand</b> <b>development</b> {{is noted}} for its {{perceived}} sharpness and relative simplicity. The process was popular in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, and was used by Eugene Atget and William Mortensen, amongst others. It has a compensating effect whereby the developer exhausts itself in areas which require greater development whilst remaining active in less-exposed areas, which {{has the effect of}} boosting shadow detail whilst preserving bright highlights. <b>Stand</b> <b>development</b> is also largely insensitive to variations in exposure, and allows for the development of films rated at different speeds in the same batch.|$|E
50|$|Sheet films can be {{processed}} in trays, in hangers (which {{are used in}} deep tanks), or rotary processing drums. Each sheet can be developed individually for special requirements. <b>Stand</b> <b>development,</b> long development in dilute developer without agitation, is occasionally used.|$|E

5000|$|The name {{is derived}} from the Seminole Indian {{language}} word meaning alligator. The initial settlement of the Allapattah community began in 1856 when William P. Wagner, the earliest documented white American permanent settler, arrived from Charleston, South Carolina and established a homestead on a hammock along the Miami Rock Ridge, where Miami Jackson High School presently <b>stands.</b> <b>Development</b> ensued from 1896 and into the 20th century in the area with the completion of the Florida East Coast Railroad (FEC).|$|R
50|$|A stand density {{management}} diagram is {{a simple}} biological model relating forest yield to forest density at any stage of a particular forest <b>stand's</b> <b>development.</b> <b>Stand</b> density management diagrams are used in forest management and designed to use a current stand's density to project its future yield. One major reason for the effectiveness of density management diagrams is the relatively low effect of site variance on the diagram’s shape. Density management diagrams have transformed ideas long held in traditional stocking diagrams. In 1967, Samuel F. Gingrich published his idea of comparing basal area per acre, trees per acre, and quadratic mean diameter in one graph. He called this the stocking diagram. These same principles are {{used to make the}} stand density management diagram work. Basal area and density are plotted against one another and quadratic mean diameter lines are plotted through the plot.|$|R
50|$|The stand {{replaced}} the old Members' Stand which had lasted since the 1920s. It contains both {{the home and}} away dressing rooms, TV camera gantry, press bench, press room and a cinema for Saint's players (this was a bar until the Barwell <b>Stand</b> <b>development).</b>|$|E
50|$|Thinning greatly {{influences}} the ecology and micro-meteorology of the stand, lowering the inter-tree competition for water. The removal of any tree from a stand has repercussions {{on the remaining}} trees both above-ground and below. Silvicultural thinning is a powerful tool {{that can be used}} to influence <b>stand</b> <b>development,</b> stand stability, and the characteristics of the harvestable products.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stand</b> <b>development</b> is a {{photographic}} development process whereby film {{is left to}} sit in a very dilute developing solution {{for an extended period of}} time, with little or no agitation. The technique dates back to at least the 1880s, and is characterised by fine grain, increased perceived sharpness, and smooth tonality, but is time-intensive and runs the risk of producing certain processing defects.|$|E

5000|$|Tanks {{are also}} helpful for long {{development}} {{techniques such as}} [...] "stand" [...] development. <b>Stand</b> <b>development</b> is very individualized, and every practitioner {{has his or her}} own routine, but in general, after an initial agitation in the developer, film is simply allowed to stand motionless in (generally highly dilute) developer, with no agitation, for very long intervals, up to hours.|$|E
50|$|For all {{practical}} purposes, {{the total volume}} produced by a stand on a given site is constant and optimum {{for a wide range}} of density or stocking. It can be decreased, but not increased, by altering the amount of growing stock to levels outside this range. Initial density affects <b>stand</b> <b>development</b> in that close spacing leads to full site utilization more quickly than wider spacing. Economic operability can be advanced by wide spacing even if total production is less than in closely spaced stands.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{important}} to note the potentially positive ramifications of this fungus. P. pini and other trunk rot fungi serve an important role in forest ecosystems as disturbance agents, and {{play a key role in}} accelerating <b>stand</b> <b>development.</b> P. pini and other forest pathogens have been shown to be instrumental in facilitating Douglas-fir growth in the western US. Additionally, decayed trees, rotting from the inside-out, serve as important habitat to cavity-nesting birds and mammals. In the southeastern United States, this fungus is important for the nesting of the red-cockaded woodpecker.|$|E

50|$|While not {{designed}} {{to be applied to}} boreal mixedwoods, the méthode du contrôle is described briefly here to illustrate the degree of sophistication applied by some European foresters to the management of their forests. Development of management techniques that allowed for <b>stand</b> <b>development</b> to be monitored and guided into sustainable paths were in part a response to past experience, particularly in Central European countries, of the negative effects of pure, uniform stands with species often unsuited to the site, which greatly increased the risk of soil degradation and biotic diseases.

50|$|How many trees {{per unit}} area (spacing) that should be planted is not an easily {{answered}} question. Establishment density targets or regeneration standards have commonly been based on traditional practice, with the implicit aim of getting the stand quickly to the free-to-grow stage. Money is wasted if more trees are planted than are needed to achieve desired stocking rates, {{and the chance to}} establish other plantations is proportionately diminished. Ingress (natural regeneration) on a site is difficult to predict and often becomes surprisingly evident only some years after planting has been carried out. Early <b>stand</b> <b>development</b> after harvesting or other disturbance undoubtedly varies greatly among sites, each of which has its own peculiar characteristics.|$|E

50|$|In {{traditional}} film development, film {{is processed}} in concentrated development fluid {{for a brief}} period of time, typically 8-12 minutes. During this period the developing fluid is agitated, often by inverting the development tank several times every few minutes. This has the effect of spreading the developing fluid evenly over the surface of the film and preventing localised overdevelopment. <b>Stand</b> <b>development</b> instead uses a very dilute solution of developer, often one part developer to fifty or one hundred parts water. There is almost no agitation beyond initial mixing, and developing times are greatly increased, often an hour or more. A related technique is semi-stand development, which uses a small amount of agitation.|$|E
