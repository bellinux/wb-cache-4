40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} which provides a basic description of the force and displacements arising in multi-stage forging on a mechanical press. Given the stiffness of tools and press structure, for a given operational sequence, the variations in shut-height caused by deJections of tools and press during forging, compared with that under no load conditions, can be determined. Also the efect of <b>a</b> change <b>in</b> process conditions at one forging station on forces and dimensions of workpieces produced at other stations can be calculated. The model has been validated by experiments undertaken on <b>a</b> crank press <b>in</b> which upsetting and extrusion have been performed as both single and simultaneous operations.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} outcome of anterior chamber intraocular lens(IOL) at Ⅰ stage versus sclera-fixed IOL at Ⅱ <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> complicated cataract surgeries with inadequate capsular support. METHODS: Complicated cataract surgeries with anterior chamber IOL(ACIOL) or scleral-fixated IOL implantation from January 2003 to December 2014 when capsular support was inadequate were included and analyzed. Postoperative best-corrected visual acuity(BCVA) were compared. Postoperative complications were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Totally 84 eyes and 79 eyes {{were included in}} the ACIOL group and in the scleral-fixated IOL group, respectively. The mean postoperative logarithm of minimal angle of resolution(LogMAR) BCVA at 1 a was 0. 30 ± 0. 64 and 0. 33 ± 0. 34 in the ACIOL group and the scleral-fixated IOL group, respectively(t = 0. 407, P = 0. 712). The mean latest LogMAR BCVA was 0. 67 ± 0. 55 and 0. 62 ± 0. 50 in the primary ACIOL group and the secondary scleral-fixated IOL group, respectively(t = 0. 225, P = 0. 545). There were more early postoperative complications in the ACIOL group(χ 2 = 14. 613, P χ 2 = 0. 231, P = 0. 267). Regression analysis suggested that ACIOL and scleral-fixated IOL implantation had similar latest postoperative LogMAR BCVA(t = 0. 397, P = 0. 957); however the existence of late complications were related with a worse final visual outcome(t = 22. 156, P CONCLUSION: The long-term differences in the visual outcomes and complication profiles after ACIOL at Ⅰ stage or scleral-fixated IOL implantation at Ⅱ <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> complicated cataract <b>operation</b> are not found when capsular support is inadequate...|$|R
50|$|The fate of ghettoised Jews across {{occupied}} Poland {{was sealed}} at Wannsee, {{where the most}} deadly phase of the Final Solution was set in motion. In July 1942, the first killing centre of Operation Reinhard built by the SS at Bełżec (just over 100 kilometres away) began its second phase of extermination, with brand new gas chambers built of brick and mortar. Sambor Jews were rounded up <b>in</b> <b>stages.</b> <b>A</b> terror <b>operation</b> was conducted in the ghetto on 2-4 August 1942 ahead of the first deportation action. The 'resettlement' rail transports to Bełżec left Sambor on 4-6 August 1942 under heavy guard, with 6,000 men, women, and children crammed into Holocaust trains without food or water. About 600 Jews were sent to Janowska concentration camp nearby. The second set of trains with 3,000-4,000 Jews departed on 17-18 and 22 October 1942. On 17 November 1942 the already depopulated ghetto was filled with expellees from Turka and Ilnik. Some Jews escaped to the forest. The town of Turka was declared Judenfrei on 1 December 1942. Irrespective of deportations, mass shootings of Jews were also carried out. In January 1943 the Germans along with the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police rounded up 1,500 Jews deemed 'incapable of working'. They were trucked to the woods near Radlowicz (Radłowicze, Radlovitze; now Ralivka) and shot one by one. Among those still alive in the ghetto death by starvation and typhus raged.|$|R
