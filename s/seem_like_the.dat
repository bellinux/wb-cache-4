Although many {{of those involved in}} the republican cause avoided participation in the uprising, making it <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> revolt had failed, it eventually succeeded thanks to the government's inability to gather enough troops to control the nearly two hundred armed revolutionaries that resisted in the Rotunda.|$|E

Alfred Taubman of Taubman Centers {{extended the}} concept further in 1980, with terrazzo tiles at the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey, indoor fountains, and two levels allowing a shopper {{to make a}} circuit of all the stores. Taubman believed carpeting increased friction, slowing down customers, so it was removed.

[...] Jordan Mintzer from Variety stated, [...] "Stewart is {{the heart and soul}} of the film", and added that she [...] "gives both weight and depth to dialogue...that would sound like typical chick-lit blather in the mouth of a less {{engaging}} actress, and she makes Bella's psychological wounds <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> real deal." ...|$|E

500|$|Ottavio, {{shown as}} tall and muscular, {{is about to}} kneel to kiss the Pope's feet, a {{contemporary}} manner of greeting a pope: a guest would make three short bows followed by the kissing of the papal feet. Titian indicates this step in the ceremony by showing Paul's shoe decorated with a cross, poking from underneath his gown. Ottavio's head is bowed, but his stern facial expression conveys that he is acting as protocol dictates, rather than with genuine diffidence. [...] Nicholas Penny notes that [...] "... at a Renaissance court bowing and scraping were usual.

Predatory lecturers taking advantage of gullible women? Actually, that's a plot line I can get my head around. The problem with being an academic perv these days is that one day sooner or later, the truth will out." [...] Lesbian culture website AfterEllen.com opined [...] "she doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> type of woman to give up without a fight" [...] where Sarah and Mike are concerned.

500|$|Corbie Dillard at Nintendo Life {{criticized the}} Wii version for using resized {{graphics}} from the Nintendo DS version without doing any [...] "touch-ups", {{resulting in a}} pixelated look. He also disliked the Wii Remote-based gameplay changes, {{saying that they were}} annoying for people who have already played the portable versions of the game. Lucas M. Thomas at IGN also found it disappointing how the graphics, audio and content had not been changed at all compared to the Nintendo DS release, saying that the visuals did not look attractive when resized to fit a larger screen; he concluded that it did not <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Wii version had been given [...] "any extra love and attention at all". Marissa Meli at GameZone called it a [...] "3/10 interpretation of a 9/10 title", saying that the pixelated graphics made the game look ugly and shoddy.|$|E

You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E

500|$|Riot Act {{received}} mixed to favorable {{reviews from}} music critics according to Metacritic, where it holds a 73 after 20 reviews. NME gave Riot Act an {{eight out of}} ten. Reviewer Louis Pattison stated that [...] "Riot Act {{is the sound of}} a band entering a powerful middle-age. They still deserve your attention." [...] AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars, saying [...] "given several plays, this does indeed <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> richest record Pearl Jam has made in a long time." [...] Spin gave the album seven out of ten stars. The review said, [...] "Pearl Jam's seventh studio album balances emotive bombast with a taut-sweaty hard-rock attack." [...] Critic Robert Christgau described Pearl Jam on the album as [...] "masters of their own audio, with soft spots where their emotions can go." [...] Rolling Stone staff writer Keith Harris gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "like Neil Young at his most deliberately despondent, Pearl Jam sound purposefully tired." [...] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B, saying that Vedder's lyrics [...] "rarely cohere", and that [...] "too few of the tense rhythmic setups build to the kind of...catharsis that would be something to Riot home about." [...] Q gave the album three out of five stars. The review called the album [...] "An adult rock record in which nuance succeeds over bombast." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{made its}} live debut {{on the opening}} night of the U2 360° Tour in Barcelona, Spain during the encore, as the show's final song. It was played at nearly every {{subsequent}} concert on the tour as the closing song, being excluded from the set list for {{only two of the}} tour's 110 shows: the 9 December 2010 concert in Brisbane, Australia and the 29 May 2011 concert in Winnipeg. Prior to performances of [...] "Moment of Surrender", a disco ball was lowered and the stage lights turned off, and Bono encouraged fans to take out their mobile phones and create [...] "a stadium full of tiny stars". The National Post commented that despite being a [...] "big-concert cliché", the move was effective and created a feeling of intimacy amongst the audience. Rolling Stone enjoyed the visual effect in context of the tour's space theme, saying it [...] "truly made it <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> stadium had reached outerspace, with thousands of cellphone lights turning into stars". The Daily Telegraph praised the [...] "galaxy of mobile phones", saying that despite the tour's impressive stage and visual effects, [...] "the most beautiful sight came when we couldn't see [...] ". In reviewing a Paris show from July 2009, the Sunday Times called [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] the only track from No Line on the Horizon performed that evening that was strong enough to deserve inclusion {{with the rest of the}} show's set list. NME was not as receptive to the song in a live setting, questioning the decision to end concerts with the song. A U2 360° Tour performance of [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] appears on the group's 2010 concert video U2 360° at the Rose Bowl. In a review of the film, Andrew Mueller of Uncut called [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] an [...] "ll-chosen closer", as well as [...] "overlong and under-realised". In 2009, the song was performed by the band on the 35th-season premiere of Saturday Night Live, and at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. On 18 June 2011, Bono closed the song with lyrics from [...] "Jungleland" [...] to honor the recently deceased E Street Band saxophonist Clarence Clemons. The song was also one of only three non-single tracks to be played by the band in their headline set at the Glastonbury Festival 2011.|$|E

I want no further satisfaction than this". The British journalist Mark Urban wrote: [...] "To those looking at Gordon's actions now, the thanks of companies trading in opium or of a government that killed millions in its suppression of rebellion might <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> most poisonous endorsements. But at the time people saw a brave man who acted with humanity in an otherwise ghastly conflict, standing out from the other mercenaries, adventurers and cut-throats in wanting almost nothing for himself".|$|E

The tour swung to the UK at the end of July, and discussions started within the band about a break: [...] "it cropped up – 'Is this fun? Are we having fun doing this?' I guess we kind of weren’t," [...] spoke Franklin in a 2011 interview. They ultimately decided to keep going until the end of the year, honoring their touring commitments, and then according to Franklin, [...] "take a bit of a time out... although it did <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> end, to me." [...] The group returned to the US to headline a nine-show club tour in the Northeast; they immediately followed with a wide-ranging Australian tour opening for Powderfinger, with their last show taking place at Bootleg Brewery in Margaret River near Perth on 13 December 1998.|$|E
2500|$|The {{case of the}} Charlotte Three was not {{something}} that was entirely unique; rather, as historian John Schutz argued, it was the ordinary in the mid 1900s South. By persecuting [...] "black leaders for conventional crimes", the state could follow [...] "civilized" [...] methods that would instead of cause violence, put the leader in jail where he could no longer do any more leading. Expert Raymond Michalowski believes these persecutions of blacks were {{similar to those of the}} KKK or other [...] "night riders of decades past" [...] but instead of illegal henchmen carrying out the attacks, legal judges and prosecutors were doing so in the courts. By charging the leaders with crimes, the state was able to make it <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> leaders were not as viable as they claimed to be. This helped to mute some of the public support the leaders may have originally garnered. Though the South seemed to have overtly fixed its race problem after the passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1964-65, it was covertly persecuting Black revolutionary leaders. The persecutions were not taking place out on the streets through public lynching as in times past, but instead through illegal backdoor deals supported by the judicial system.|$|E
