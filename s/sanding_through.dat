50|$|During the 80s Georges Vriz {{developed}} {{a technique called}} piercing, layering two veneer layers {{on top of each}} other and <b>sanding</b> <b>through</b> the top one, to the point of fiber transparency. This has been used mainly in France, by professionals and students of the École Boulle.|$|E
5000|$|In the US the {{technique}} {{has been used}} at the American School of French Marquetry {{by one of the}} teachers, artist Patrice Lejeune. The school staff is also proposing a new name for it: [...] "Given that 'piercing' is an unfortunate mistake in the veneering world, we chose to use the word [...] "Fusion" [...] instead, by which term the artist expresses his intention of <b>sanding</b> <b>through</b> the veneer as a decorative, textural effect, not as a mistake." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cabinet {{frames and}} doors may be {{fashioned}} from solid wood (typically {{a species of}} hardwood), medium density fiberboard (MDF), particle board, plywood, or a combination, and may include lamination or a surface coating over these core materials. A floating panel in a door can be hardwood-veneer plywood captured within a solid wood or MDF frame. Solid wood and MDF can be edge-shaped, e.g., to round or pattern the edges of doors, drawer fronts, or face frames. Particle board, once manufactured, cannot be edge-shaped suitably. Plywood cannot be shaped without revealing its veneer core, often considered unsightly, though edge-shaped furniture-grade plywood with thin plies 1/16 in is considered attractive for limited uses. MDF, once shaped, can be coated conformally with flexible veneers such as thermofoil or can be painted. It can also be covered with wood veneer or high-pressure laminate {{but only if the}} edge profile is square or approximately so (to within the veneer thickness). Today many cabinet doors and drawer fronts utilize an MDF core. Doors and drawer fronts may also be fashioned of particle board surfaced with high-pressure laminate. Natural wood offers its subtle combination of color, grain, pore pattern, variable absorption and smoothness of finish, and variation with viewing angle and lighting condition. The appearance of natural wood can only be achieved with solid wood components (wherever edges are shaped) or possibly veneer (where they are not); as already pointed out, the two approaches can be combined in a single cabinet. Various transparent grain-revealing finishes including shellac, lacquer, varnish, or polyurethane have been devised. A built-up finish may optionally utilize diverse pigments, dyes, bleaches, glazes, or wood fillers that may highlight contrasting colorants. Finishes can be applied by brush or spray and may comprise many separately applied layers. Accordingly, finishes formulated by differing manufacturers do not, in general, exactly match. Distressing the wood cabinets is another finish application and is often done in conjunction with glazes, stains, paints or dyes. This process consists of adding manufactured imperfections to cabinet doors to give the wood cabinets an aged, distressed, old-world rustic appearance. Common techniques include creating wormholes, rasping, dings and dents and <b>sanding</b> <b>through</b> the wood and layers of finish unevenly.|$|E

40|$|Utstillingen The Passing of a Grain of <b>Sand</b> <b>through</b> a Sieve markerer slutten på Andreas Buntes stipendiatprosjekt Library for A-Scientific Film. Utstillingsperiode: 30. oktober – 16. november. Åpning: Fredag 30. oktober kl. 18. 00. Sted: Kunstnernes Hus, Akademirommet og auditoriet. The {{passing of}} {{a grain of}} <b>sand</b> <b>through</b> a sieve, the {{currents}} of a riverbed, the ideal human somersault: These are typical subject matters of the scientific motion studies produced by the Institut für den Wissenschaftlichen Film (IWF). Until 2011, the IWF produced thousands of scientific research films to create a large archive of scientific films. These were to respond to pressing research question of the present, but also offer answers to questions which may arise in the future. Andreas Bunte’s project "Library for A-Scientific Film" investigates this highly specialized film genre as a format for artistic production. Within the framework of his three-year research period as {{a fellow of the}} Norwegian Artistic Research Programme at the Academy of Fine Art in Oslo, Andreas Bunte has produced a number of films appropriating aspects of the explicitly anti-narrative method of filmmaking that the genre has generated. His artistic research project examines the filmic grammar and the conceptual underpinnings of scientific research film in terms of its proposed objectivity, as well as its connections to contemporary theory and the most recent developments in ethnographic filmmaking. The exhibition "The Passing of a Grain of <b>Sand</b> <b>through</b> a Sieve" at Akademirommet and the Auditorium at Kunstnernes Hus marks the closure of Bunte’s work as a research fellow and assembles the films he produced during the research period. His most recent production "Safe Disassembly", 2015, will premiere at the occasion. It was shot in a former ammunition production factory in the former GDR, which today deals with the careful dissection of cluster ammunition...|$|R
