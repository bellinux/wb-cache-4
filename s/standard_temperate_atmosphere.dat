40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) such as PAHs {{are subject to}} long-range atmospheric transport, which can result in the contamination of remote {{areas such as the}} Arctic. A simple model was developed to describe the removal processes of four PAHs; fluorene (FLU), phenanthrene (PHEN), fluoranthene (FLA) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) transported over a 5 day period from a source area over the UK to the Russian Arctic. The purpose of this model was to study processes affecting the PAHs within the atmosphere, rather than their interaction with the earth's surface. The components to the model included gas/particle partitioning, reaction with OH radicals and dry and wet deposition (both rain and snow). Atmospheric/meteorological parameters for the geographical region of interest were generated from three-dimensional atmospheric models. Air concentrations were prescribed in the source area with no additional PAH inputs along the transect, both winter and summer scenarios were modelled. Reaction with OH was a major removal mechanism for gas-phase FLU, PHEN and FLA, most notably in the <b>temperate</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Wet deposition in the form of snow accounted for the majority of PAH loss in the winter, although the gas and particle scavenging ratios used in this model ranged over several orders of magnitude. Using a 5 day transport scenario in a ` 1 -hop’ event, the model predicted that a primary emission of FLA and B[a]P to the atmosphere of the southern UK, would not reach the Russian Arctic at a distance of 3500 km, assuming a constant windspeed of 10 m s− 1. However, both FLU and PHEN with calculated half-lives of > 60 h during the winter could be transported to this area under this scenario...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{refraction}} affects {{to various}} degrees exoplanet transit, lunar eclipse, {{as well as}} stellar occultation observations. Exoplanet retrieval algorithms often use analytical expressions for the column abundance along a ray traversing the atmosphere {{as well as for}} the deflection of that ray, which are first order approximations valid for low densities in a spherically symmetric homogeneous isothermal atmosphere. We derive new analytical formulae for both of these quantities, which are valid for higher densities, and use them to refine and validate a new ray tracing algorithm which can be used for arbitrary atmospheric temperature-pressure profiles. We illustrate with simple isothermal atmospheric profiles the consequences of our model for different planets: temperate Earth-like and Jovian-like planets, as well as HD 189733 b, and GJ 1214 b. We find that, for both hot exoplanets, our treatment of refraction does not make much of a difference to pressures as high as 10 atmosphere, but that it is important to consider the variation of gravity with altitude for GJ 1214 b. However, we find that the <b>temperate</b> <b>atmospheres</b> have an apparent scale height significantly smaller than their actual density scale height at densities larger than 1 amagat, thus increasing the difficulty of detecting spectral features originating in these regions. These denser atmospheric regions form a refractive boundary layer where column abundances and ray deflection increases dramatically with decreasing impact parameter. This refractive boundary layer mimics a surface, and none of the techniques mentioned above can probe atmospheric regions denser than about 4 amagat on these temperate planets.

Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in low-lying areas, especially near the coast. During the summer, average temperatures may reach the low 30s °C, with maxima touching the mid 40s. The south coast of the island, including the Mesara Plain and Asterousia Mountains, falls in the North African climatic zone, and thus reaches higher temperatures throughout the year. In southern Crete, date palms bear fruit and swallows remain all year round, without migrating to Africa.|$|R

40|$|Isoprene hydroxynitrates (IN) are tracers of the {{photochemical}} oxidation of isoprene in high NO x environments. Production {{and loss of}} IN have a significant influence on the NO x cycle and tropospheric O 3 chemistry. To better understand IN chemistry, a series of photochemical reaction chamber experiments was conducted to determine the IN yield from isoprene photooxidation at high NO concentrations (> 100 ppt). By combining experimental data and calculated isomer distributions, a total IN yield of 9 (+ 4 /− 3) % was derived. The result was applied in a zero-dimensional model to simulate production and loss of ambient IN observed in a <b>temperate</b> forest <b>atmosphere,</b> during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) field campaign, from 27 May to 11 July 2013. The 9 % yield {{was consistent with the}} observed IN/(MVK+MACR) ratios observed during SOAS. By comparing field observations with model simulations, we identified NO as the limiting factor for ambient IN production during SOAS, but vertical mixing at dawn might also contribute (~ 27 %) to IN dynamics. A close examination of isoprene's oxidation products indicates that its oxidation transitioned from a high-NO dominant chemical regime in the morning into a low-NO dominant regime in the afternoon. A significant amount of IN produced in the morning high NO regime could be oxidized in the low NO regime, and a possible reaction scheme was proposed...|$|R
40|$|Redirection {{of sewage}} sludge in {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTP) from landfilling or incineration to biological treatment, for instance anaerobic digestion, has {{become a part of}} the current global environmental, economic and regulatory issues. A statistical approach, based on a design of experiments, was adopted in order to assess methane production from the anaerobic co-digestion of mixed sewage sludge (MS) with crude glycerol (cGly) and waste frying oil (WFO). The effect of three factors MS concentration, co-substrate concentration, and fraction of cGly (xcGly) in a mixture (w/w) of cGly and WFO on biochemical methane potential (BMP) and the maximum initial methane production rate (kCH 4) was assessed by a Central Composite Design Circumscribed. In the absence of a co-substrate, MS digestion reached a BMP of (294 ± 6) L kg- 1 (L of methane at <b>standard</b> <b>temperate</b> and pressure (STP) conditions per kg of VS of waste added) and a kCH 4 of (64 ± 1) L kg- 1 d- 1 (L of methane at STP conditions per kg of VS of waste added and per day), with a biodegradability of (56 ± 1) %. After optimization, MS and co-substrate concentrations of 4. 64 g L- 1 and 8. 77 g L- 1, respectively, with xcGly of 0. 8 were defined as the condition to simultaneously boost BMP (91 %) and kCH 4 (250 %). An WWTP would be able to save 36. 2 k in electricity per 1 000 m 3 {{of sewage sludge}} produced, if the selected co-digestion conditions were applied, rather than digesting only the sludge.

60|$|We {{are now in}} a {{position}} to test the general theories, or, to speak more correctly, the popular notions, as to the origin of animal coloration, before proceeding to apply the principle of utility to the explanation of some among the many extraordinary manifestations of colour in the animal world. The most generally received theory undoubtedly is, that brilliancy and variety of colour are due to the direct action of light and heat; a theory no doubt derived from the abundance of bright-coloured birds, insects, and flowers which are brought from tropical regions. There are, however, two strong arguments against this theory. We have already seen how generally bright coloration is wanting in desert animals, yet here heat and light are both at a maximum, and if these alone were the agents in the production of colour, desert animals should be the most brilliant. Again, all naturalists who have lived in tropical regions know that the proportion of bright to dull coloured species is little if any greater there than in the temperate zone, while there are many tropical groups in which bright colours are almost entirely unknown. No part of the world presents so many brilliant birds as South America, yet there are extensive families, containing many hundreds of species, which are as plainly coloured as our average temperate birds. Such are the families of the bush-shrikes and ant-thrushes (Formicariidae), the tyrant-shrikes (Tyrannidae), the American creepers (Dendrocolaptidae), together with {{a large proportion of the}} wood-warblers (Mniotiltidae), the finches, the wrens, and some other groups. In the eastern hemisphere, also, we have the babbling-thrushes (Timaliidae), the cuckoo-shrikes (Campephagidae), the honey-suckers (Meliphagidae), and several other smaller groups which are certainly not coloured above the average <b>standard</b> of <b>temperate</b> birds.|$|R

This study investi-gated the temporal and spatial dynamics of airborne viruses and their genotypic characteristics in air samples collected from three distinct land use types (a residential district [RD], a forest [FR], and an industrial complex [IC]) and from rainwater sam-ples freshly precipitated at the RD site (RD-rain). Viral abundance exhibited a seasonal fluctuation in the range between 1. 7 106 and 4. 0 107 viruses m 3, which increased from autumn to winter and decreased toward spring, but no significant spatial differences were observed. Temporal variations in viral abundance were inversely correlated with seasonal changes in tempera-ture and absolute humidity. Metagenomic analysis of air viromes amplified by rolling-circle phi 29 polymerase-based random hexamer priming indicated the dominance of plant-associated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) geminivirus-related viruses, fol-lowed by animal-infecting circovirus-related sequences, with low numbers of nanoviruses andmicrophages-related genomes. Particularly, the majority of the geminivirus-related viruses were closely related to ssDNAmycoviruses that infect plant-patho-genic fungi. Phylogenetic analysis based on the replication initiator protein sequence indicated that the airborne ssDNA viruses were distantly related to known ssDNA viruses, suggesting that a high diversity of viruses were newly discovered.

40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} triclosan (TCS) {{has been}} detected in household wastewaters (untreated and treated) and receiving environments across the globe. The toxic effects of TCS on <b>temperate</b> <b>standard</b> aquatic test organisms {{have been widely}} reported with microalgae being the most sensitive. However, environmental differences between tropical and temperate regions may have selected different trait compositions between these two regions, which in turn {{may lead to a}} difference in species sensitivity. Therefore, additional information is required to better characterize risks to organisms in tropics and ensure biodiversity in these regions is not adversely impacted. This study aims to supplement existing TCS toxicity data with five aquatic invertebrates found in tropics and to compare the sensitivity between aquatic invertebrate species from tropical and temperate regions. In addition, the effect of pH on the toxicity of neutral and ionized forms of TCS to microalgae (Chlorella ellipsoidea) was investigated. The reported 96 -h LC 50 values for the studied invertebrate species ranged from 72 to 962 μg/L. There {{was no significant difference between}} the sensitivity of aquatic invertebrate species from tropical and temperate regions.

The findings of this study can be used to support site-specific water quality criteria and environmental risk assessment for TCS in tropical regions.

40|$|The risk {{assessment}} of pesticides for freshwater ecosystems in the Amazon {{has relied on}} the use of toxicity data and water quality criteria derived for temperate regions {{due to a lack of}} ecotoxicological studies performed with indigenous species. This leaves an unknown margin of uncertainty for the protection of Amazonian ecosystems, as differences in environmental conditions and species sensitivity are not taken into account. To address this issue, the acute toxic effects of malathion (an organophosphorus insecticide) and carbendazim (a benzimidazole fungicide) were assessed on five fish and five freshwater invertebrates endemic to the Amazonian region. Subsequently, the intrinsic sensitivity of Amazonian and temperate freshwater species was compared using the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) concept. Amazonian species sensitivity to malathion was found to be similar to that of their temperate counterparts, with LC 50 values ranging between 111 and 1507  μg/l for fish species and 2. 1 – 426  μg/l for arthropod species. However, Amazonian fish appeared to be slightly less sensitive for carbendazim than temperate fish with LC 50 values ranging between 1648 and 4238  μg/l, and Amazonian invertebrates were found to be significantly more resistant than their temperate counterparts, with LC 50 values higher than 16000  μg/l. The results of this study suggest that for these compounds, the use of water quality criteria derived with laboratory toxicity data for temperate species will result in a sufficient protection level for Amazonian freshwater organisms. Recommendations for further research include the validation of threshold concentrations derived with <b>temperate</b> <b>standard</b> test species and with the SSD model with semi-field experiments considering larger assemblages of indigenous species under local environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Herbicide {{contamination}} is {{ubiquitous in}} rivers and coastal waters in Queensland, Australia. Globally, most ecotoxicological studies to date investigating the toxicity of herbicides {{have focused on}} temperate test-organisms and test-conditions, {{and there is a}} paucity of information on herbicide toxicity in tropical ecosystems. Despite the established ecological importance of benthic microflora in estuarine habitats, research investigating the effects of herbicides on these communities is particularly under-represented in the tropics. Due to a documented variability in organismal and chemical responses to environmental parameters, the validity of extrapolating from effect-concentrations derived using temperate organisms to tropical environments is debatable. Recent detections of herbicides in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon underscore the need to advance the understanding of their toxicity to local non-target species. The research presented in this thesis therefore explores the extent and effects of herbicide pollution on locally isolated tropical estuarine microphytobenthos (MPB), using the photosystem II (PSII) -inhibitors diuron and tebuthiuron (urea-derivatives), atrazine and simazine (s-triazines), and hexazinone (triazinone), and the amino acid synthesis-inhibitor imazapic (imidazolinone) as model compounds. The composition and structure of previously un-described diatom (Ochrophyta) communities in six creeks and estuaries in the Wet and Dry Tropics of the GBR lagoon is presented, along with a review of the ecological importance of the MPB. Nearly 300 diatom taxa were observed in these coastal samples, with average abundances of 1. 01 x 106 and 1. 27 x 106 cells mL- 1 sediment in the Wet and Dry Tropics, respectively. Through analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) based on cell counts of digested material, it was established that estuarine benthic diatom-communities in the GBR are comparable across climate zones (coastal Wet and Dry Tropics). Pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry is ideally suited to measure the sublethal impacts of PSII-inhibitors on microalgae, but key relationships between effective quantum yield [Y(II) ] measured by PAM fluorometry and the traditional endpoints growth rate (μ) and biomass increase has not previously been established. The effects of the herbicides diuron, hexazinone, and atrazine on Y(II), μ, and biomass increase were therefore examined during standardized three-day growth inhibition tests coupled with PAM fluorometry using the locally isolated benthic microalgae Navicula sp. (Ochrophyta) and Nephroselmis pyriformis (Chlorophyta). The relationships between Y(II), μ and biomass increase were consistent (r 2 ≥ 0. 90) and linear (1 : 1), validating the utility of PAM fluorometry as a rapid and reliable technique to measure sub-lethal toxicity of PSII-inhibitors in these microalgae. The order of toxicity (EC 50 -range) was: diuron (16 – 33 nM) > hexazinone (25 – 110 nM) > atrazine (130 – 620 nm) for both algal species. To provide significant information on the sensitivity of local tropical microalgae to herbicides under environmentally relevant conditions, the acute effects of diuron, tebuthiuron, atrazine, simazine, and hexazinone, along with binary mixtures and herbicide breakdown products (desethyl-atrazine [DEA] and 3, 4 -dichloroaniline [3, 4 -DCA]) were investigated using a Maxi-Imaging PAM bioassay (I-PAM) measuring the previously validated endpoint Y(II). The sensitivities of the tropical N. pyriformis, Navicula sp. and Cylindrotheca closterium (Ochrophyta), were compared with the <b>temperate</b> <b>standard</b> testorganism Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Ochrophyta). The order of toxicity (IC 50 -range) was diuron (8. 8 – 18. 3 nM) > hexazinone (9. 5 – 27. 2 nM) > tebuthiuron (52 – 412 nM) > atrazine (66 – 356 nM) > simazine (121 – 1200 nM) > DEA (1150 – 5640 nM) > 3, 4 -DCA (no effect) for all species. Nephroselmis pyriformis was always the most sensitive species, whereas the responses of the tropical and temperate diatoms tested here were similar to each other. All binary mixtures exhibited additive toxicity. To estimate local MPB exposure to herbicides, sediment and porewaters from the Herbert, Johnstone, Tully, and Daintree Rivers were analysed for these contaminants. Diuron was detected in samples from all sites at concentrations ranging between 0. 01 – 0. 23 nM in porewater and 1. 3 – 42. 9 nmol kg- 1 dry weight (DW) in sediments, whereas atrazine, simazine, hexazinone, and tebuthiuron were detected less frequently. Porewater extracts were tested for acute phytotoxicity using the I-PAM bioassay and the results were compared with chemical analyses of the same water samples. Porewaters elicited up to 3. 6...|$|R
