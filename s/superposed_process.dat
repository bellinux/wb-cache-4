Detailed geological mapping and structural analyses shows the eastward shortening associated with metamorphism indicative of three deformation events. Three sets of axial plane foliation S 1, S 2, and S 3 can be recognized by Type- 1 and Type- 3 fold interference patterns. Different structural characteristics can be further revealed in five domains based on domain analysis. Each domain shows the <b>superposed</b> <b>process</b> characteristics. Synthetic structural mapping and microstructure examination analyses on the Shoufengsi area show that NE-trending isoclinal folds and axial D 1 and D 2 plane foliation events represent shortening deformation and NW-trending crenulation cleavage.

We initially explain how to fit two-state M 3 PPs to empirical traces of counts. We then propose a novel form of composition, called interposition, which enables the approximate superposition of several two-state M 3 PPs without incurring into state space explosion. Compared to exact superposition, {{where the state}} space grows exponentially {{in the number of}} composed processes, in interposition the state space grows linearly in the number of composed M 3 PPs.

40|$|A cluster point {{process model}} is {{considered}} {{for the analysis of}} fine-scale rainfall time series. The model is based on three Poisson processes. The first is a Poisson process of storm origins, where each storm has a random (exponential) lifetime. The second is a Poisson process of cell origins that occur during the storm lifetime, terminating when the storm finishes. Each cell has a random lifetime that follows an exponential distribution (or terminates when the storm terminates, whichever occurs first). During cell lifetimes, a third Poisson process of instantaneous pulses occurs. The model is essentially an extension of the well-known Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulses model, with the rectangular profiles replaced with a Poisson process of instantaneous pulse depths to ensure more realistic rainfall profiles for fine-scale series. Model equations, derived in Cowpertwait et al. (2007), are used to fit different sets of properties to a 60 year record of 5 -min data taken from Kelburn, New Zealand. As in the previous work, two <b>superposed</b> <b>processes</b> are used to account for two main and distinct precipitation types (convective and stratiform).

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to study how auroral {{potential}} structures close at high altitude. We analyse all electric field data collected by Polar on auroral field lines in 1996 – 2001 by integrating the electric field along the spacecraft orbit to obtain the plasma potential, from which we identify potential minima by an automatic method. From these we estimate the associated effective mapped-down electric field Ei, defined as {{the depth of the}} potential minimum divided by its half-width in the ionosphere. Notice that although we use the ionosphere as a reference altitude, the field Ei does not actually exist in the ionosphere but is just a convenient computational quantity. We obtain the statistical distribution of Ei as a function of altitude, magnetic local time (MLT), Kp index and the footpoint solar illumination condition. Surprisingly, we find two classes of electric field structures. The first class consists of the low-altitude potential structures that are presumably associated with inverted-V regions and discrete auroral arcs and their set of associated phenomena. We show that the first class exists only below ~ 3 RE radial distance, and it occurs in all nightside MLT sectors (RE=Earth radius). The second class exists only above radial distance R= 4 RE and almost only in the midnight MLT sector, with a preference for high Kp values. Interestingly, in the middle altitudes (R= 3 – 4 RE) the number of potential minima is small, suggesting that the low and high altitude classes are not simple field-aligned extensions of each other. This is also underlined by the fact that statistically the high altitude structures seem to be substorm-related, while the low altitude structures seem to correspond to stable auroral arcs. The new finding of the existence of the two classes is important for theories of auroral acceleration, since it supports a closed potential structure model for stable arcs, while during substorms, different <b>superposed</b> <b>processes</b> take place that are associated with the disconnected high-altitude electric field structures.

40|$|The Lagrangian scheme ATTILA {{is used to}} {{calculate}} age spectra and the mean age of air in the general circulation model ECHAM 4. The advantage of the Lagrangian method is that temporal variation in transport is taken into account and that beyond transport times the actual transport pathways can be investigated. We found a strong seasonal cycle in mean age and age spectra, especially at high latitudes. When plotting polar age spectra against time, it can clearly be seen that the edge of the polar vortex acts as an efficient transport barrier and that exchange with extra-polar air takes place only {{for a short period of}} approximately two months after the polar vortex has broken down. Compared to observations the mean age is reproduced satisfactorily below approximately 20 km. Above that level however, the mean age is underestimated, especially at high latitudes. Furthermore, the observed sharp meridional gradient is located too far polewards in the model, which indicates that the subtropical transport barrier is too weak. There is a distinct variation in the shape of the age spectra with latitude. At low latitudes the age spectra consist of one single peak, whereas at higher latitudes secondary peaks appear, which are one year apart and whose positions in the spectrum are independent of the location. At polar latitudes there are even several peaks of approximately equal size. We explain these peaks with two <b>superposing</b> <b>processes.</b> First, the seasonal cycle of the upward mass flux at the tropical tropopause produces a single peak age distribution. And second, at polar latitudes, the temporal evolution of the polar vortex allows mixing of polar and subtropical air only once a year, which results in a superposition of these single peak age distributions. A final investigation of the transport pathways gave indications for predominant routes from the tropics to high latitudes resulting in altitude dependent meridional transport, however, more detailed studies of 3 D trajectory data will be needed to clarify this issue...|$|R

This feature is of primary interest {{when it comes to}} sampling since it minimizes the truncation error for a fixed truncation level of the series. We quantify the quality of the approximation in two ways. First, we derive a bound in probability for the truncation error.

The numerical methods exploit an exact relation between the loss probability in a finite-buffer queue and the queue length distribution in the corresponding infinite-buffer queue. The exact relation enable us to efficiently compute the loss probability with sufficient accuracy, since the asymptotic or exact queue length distribution in the infinite-buffer queue can be efficiently estimated by stable formulas...|$|R

LANF act as preferential channels for fluid flow {{and in some cases}} they Seismicity promoted fluid overpressure. Fluid–rock interactions along some detachments favour the development of extension. In contrast, frictional fault reactivation theory predicts that slip on LANF is extremely unlikely: this prediction is consistent with the absence of moderate-to-large earthquakes on normal faults dipping less than 30 °. In order to discuss this discrepancy I will analyse and integrate: 1) geological data from 9 LANF, 2) the dip- range of earthquake-ruptures in extensional environments, and 3) frictional fault mechanics. ￼LANF fault zone structure is represented by two end members: a) a thick mylonitic shear zone <b>superposed</b> by cataclastic <b>processes</b> and some localization; 2) a discrete fault core separating hangingwall and footwall phyllosilicates that in general are characterised by low frictional strength, μb 0. 4, and inherently stable, velocity-strengthening frictional behaviour.

However in my view, the integration of the three datasets does not provide a simple mechanical solution for the LANF paradox since it leaves two important open questions.

40|$|High-quality Ge {{substrates}} have numerous applications, including high-efficiency III-V multijunction {{solar cells}} and photodetectors. But {{the high cost}} of single-crystalline Ge makes the use of Ge-on-Si virtual substrates more practical for device fabrication. However, the lattice mismatch between Ge and Si leads to a highly strained Ge layer when grown directly on the Si lattice. The high mismatch strain unavoidably leads to defects, primarily dislocations, that degrade the Ge film quality. Several approaches for mitigating these defects have been proposed, including selective epitaxial growth (SEG), in which one employs an amorphous layer (most often SiO 2) as a mask to reduce the epitaxial contact between the Ge and Si lattices to lower the mismatch strain. SEG has been demonstrated to successfully produce high-quality Ge films on Si, although defects are not fully eliminated. Further improvements will require quantitative understanding of the underlying atomic-scale mechanisms. ^ In this work, we present a computational framework to atomistically model the components of the SEG system (Si/SiO 2 /Ge). The model is validated by comparing predictions to experimental observations and ab initio calculations of various properties related to crystalline Si and Ge and amorphous SiO 2, as well as combinations of these materials. The framework is then applied to study in detail the deposition of Ge on amorphous SiO 2. It is shown that the simulations are able to access experimentally meaningful deposition conditions and reproduce several quantities related to the island size distribution. We then extend our simulation framework for deposition to include coarse projective integration (CPI). CPI is a multiscale modeling technique well-suited for situations, like atomic deposition, in which a system exhibits fast, stochastic <b>processes,</b> <b>superposed</b> onto slowly-evolving dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate an approach for generating atomistic configurations from limited knowledge of an island size distribution, which represents one of the key challenges in applying CPI to atomistic deposition.

These mountains formed hundreds of kilometers from active plate margins. The formation of the Atlas Mountains was greatly influenced by a previous Mesozoic intracontinental rift system. This rift system spanned half of the African continent and was larger in breadth than the Red Sea. This study set out to synthesize existing data and studies of the Atlas Mountains and integrate these data with new geological, geophysical and remote sensing data. The construction of a tectonic map was undertaken to define the tectonic units and terraines of North Africa. The delineation of these regions allow for the study of how they have interacted during the kinematic evolution of the Atlas system. Geological field work was undertaken to study the kinematics of inversion tectonics and to construct a balanced geological-geophysical transect. The transect suggests shortening across the orogen (36 km) was achieved by thrusting along detachments at several levels in the upper crust. Syn-rift and post-rift sedimentary rocks were uplifted by the reactivation of Synrift normal faults and newly formed thin-skinned thrust faults. A restoration of the deformed cross section indicates the original Atlas rift basin was approximately 113 kilometers wide. Shortening across the High Atlas Mountains resulted in a partitioning of strain, with the greatest magnitude of shortening occurring along the margins of the High Atlas Mountains. The partitioning of strain may involve the transfer of shortening from the margins at shallow depths, to the mid-lower crust in the central region of the orogen. Thrusting in the High Atlas Mountains is bivergent, with thrusts dipping to the south along the northern margin, and northward dipping faults to the south. The presence of preexisting structural geometries such as accommodation zones, fault ramps, fault relays and en echelon faulting formed by rift processes will have an effect on subsequent compressional stress fields generated by plate convergence and other tectonic <b>processes.</b> <b>Superposed</b> folding which is disharmonic may in fact be a unique characteristic to inverted rift systems that result in intracontinental mountain belts...|$|R
40|$|Since 1971 {{observations}} in X rays of several thousands of galaxy clusters have uncovered {{huge amounts of}} hot baryons filling up the deep gravitational potential wells provided by dark matter (DM) halos with masses of some 1015 M&sun; and sizes of millions of light-years. At temperatures T~ 108 K and with average densities of n~ 1 particle per liter, such baryons add up to some 1014 M&sun;. With the neutralizing electrons, they constitute the best proton-electron plasma in the Universe (whence the apt name Intra Cluster Plasma, ICP), one where the thermal energy per particle overwhelms the electron-proton Coulomb interaction by extralarge factors of order 1012. The ICP shines in X rays by thermal bremsstrahlung radiation, with powers up to several 1045 erg s- 1 equivalent to some 1011 solar luminosities. The first observations were soon confirmed in X rays by the detection of high excitation emission lines, and in the radio band by studies of streamlined radiogalaxies moving through the ICP. Later on they were nailed down by the first measurements in microwaves of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, i. e., the inverse Compton upscattering of cold cosmic background photons at T≈ 2. 73 K off the hot ICP electrons at kBT~ 5 keV. A key physical feature of the ICP is constituted by its good local thermal equilibrium, and by its overall hydrostatic condition in the DM wells, modulated by entropy. The latter is {{set up in the}} cluster center by the initial halo collapse, and is progressively added at the outgrowing cluster boundary by standing shocks in the supersonic flow of intergalactic gas into the DM potential wells. Such physical conditions are amenable to detailed modeling. We review here these entropy-based models and discuss their outcomes and predictions concerning the ICP observables in X rays and in microwaves, as well as the underlying DM parameters. These quantitative outcomes highlight the tight relationship between the detailed ICP profiles and the cosmological evolution of the containing DM potential wells. The results also provide the simplest baseline for disentangling a number of additional and intriguing physical <b>processes</b> <b>superposed</b> to the general equilibrium. The present Report is focused on the ICP physics as driven by the two-stage evolution of the containing DM halos. We extensively discuss the basic entropy pattern established by the cluster formation and development, and cover: the central entropy erosion produced by radiative cooling that competes with the intermittent energy inputs due to active galactic nuclei and mergers; outer turbulent support linked with weakening shocks and decreasing inflow through the virial boundary, causing reduced entropy production during the late stage of DM halo evolution; the development from high to low entropy levels throughout a typical cluster; perturbations of the equilibrium up to outright disruption due to deep impacts of infalling galaxy groups or collisions with comparable companion clusters; relativistic energy distributions of electrons accelerated during such events, producing extended radio emission by synchrotron radiation and contributing non thermal pressure support for the ICP. We conclude with discussing selected contributions from cluster astrophysics to cosmology at large, and by addressing how the ICP features and processes will constitute enticing targets for observations with the ongoing Planck mission, for upcoming instrumentation like ALMA and other ground-based radio observatories, and for the next-generation of X-ray satellites from ASTRO-H to eROSITA...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, several {{questions}} are raised {{that are related}} to the niche concept and population ecology. They are within a framework of the amphibious softwater plant community Eleocharition multicaulis Vanden Berghen 1969. This community has declined during the 20 th century and several of its species are rare or endangered. The community, with typical species like Eleocharis multicaulis, Hypericum elodes and Scirpus fluitans, has not been the subject of much research as yet. Therefore, {{more research is needed to}} better understand the requirements of Eleocharition species and the mechanisms that rule community structure, if we want to know how to restore their habitat most effectively. The research questions in this thesis can be broadly summarized as 1) which environmental factors define the realized niche of the species, and what is the realized niche of these species, 2) how important are environmental gradients compared to biotic interactions in determining community structure, 3) to what extent do the realized niches of the species support theoretical models of coexistence, and 4) is relative population performance related to plant strategy in a predictive way? To document the realized niches, soil and water chemical data were collected from several softwater lakes across Western Europe, both in summer and winter. Two different approaches were used to model the niches, either using a regression framework (chapter 3; generalized linear mixed models and proportional odds models) or by the use of discriminant analysis (chapter 2). The former was applied at a West-European scale for five species, while the latter was applied at the scale of Belgium and The Netherlands for one species, Eleocharis multicaulis. Also, two different approaches of predictor selection were applied before analysis. One way (chapter 3) was to make a shortlist of mainly proximal environmental variables (resource gradients and direct gradients sensu Austin 2005). Another was to start with all information from a large environmental dataset, and to screen for potential explanatory variables using a univariate method (chapter 2). The approach that started from a reduced list of mainly proximal variables resulted in five predictors (see below) after model fitting (chapter 3). This method has the advantage of simplification in searching for relevant niche differences, as well as robustness for prediction because of model parsimony. To a large extent, the longer list of relevant variables in chapter 2 could be matched to these five predictors by correlation. Consequently one might prefer the ‘short list’. The short list was convenient to test some expected niche patterns from theoretical ecology in a regression framework. However, its scope remains limited when the aim is also to hypothesize on relevant biogeochemical processes that shape the species’ niche. In that case, the added explanatory value of several ionic ratios and macro-ionic concentrations becomes apparent, even though they are statistically correlated to other variables with explanatory power. It is therefore suggested that univariate screening techniques are a worthy alternative for variable selection in ecology. The advice to practitioners of either approach of variable selection, is to be conscious of the pros and cons of each approach, and clearly base their field design on explicit questions or hypotheses. The main groups of influential variables that came out of the analyses in chapter 2, were those that were related to 1) the redox potential (among which soil silicon and surface water ammonium/nitrate ratio), 2) acidity & base richness, 3) base cation replenishment during winter, 4) soil nitrogen availability (among which several ionic ratios), 5) soil phosphorus availability and 6) nutrient richness of the organic layer. Our hypothesis, that Eleocharis multicaulis is confined to an acid situation rich in ammonium and carbon dioxide, nutrient-poor water and soil and a mineral substrate devoid of organic material, did not hold as a whole. The five predictors obtained with the methods in chapter 3, were: four surface water variables - calcium and the resource variables ammonium, nitrate and orthophosphate - and the soil silicon content, which was related to surface water pH. Nitrate was negatively correlated with the ammonium/nitrate ratio, which was actually used in the regression models. Calcium was related to pH and alkalinity of the surface water. Four of the five investigated species showed clear patterns in relation to the finally selected gradients in chapter 3. One species (Juncus bulbosus) was very unspecific; its realized niche was not limited within the investigated environmental range and vegetation type. The two species entitled ‘characteristic’ of the vegetation alliance (Eleocharis multicaulis and Hypericum elodes) showed opposite differences with respect to nutrients and silicon. Agrostis canina, Hypericum elodes and Hydrocotyle vulgaris were similar in their reaction to these predictors but with different positions along the gradient. As Hypericum elodes (characteristic of the Eleocharition), Agrostis canina and Hydrocotyle vulgaris (non-characteristic) were positively associated, the distinction between characteristic and non-characteristic species does not hold. Eleocharis multicaulis reacted positively to nitrogen ions, as long as nitrate remained dominant over ammonium (ammonium/nitrate ratio < 1), phosphorus and potassium remained low, the water was acid and had a high redox potential. The importance of ionic ratios as potential predictors of plant performance and abundance received special attention in this thesis. Based on a literature search of habitat studies, we give an overview of ionic ratios that have been used. For most of the ratios there is a physiological explanation how they directly act upon the plant. It can be concluded that several ionic ratios have the potential of being a strong predictor for species abundance or occurrence. Modellers of plant’s niches and performance should more often consider ionic ratios instead of testing only for simple nutrient or macro-ionic gradients. In order to assess the relative importance of nutrient availability, surface water level fluctuations and species identity in the organization of Eleocharition communities, a laboratory experiment was conducted (chapter 4). Softwater lake habitat was simulated during one growing season, mimicking water level fluctuation, photoperiod and temperature. Artificial communities consisted of small populations of four softwater macrophyte species: Luronium natans, Baldellia ranunculoides ssp. repens, Eleocharis multicaulis and Hydrocotyle vulgaris. These communities were subjected to two levels of aqueous carbon dioxide and ammonium. Additionally, monocultures of Baldellia ranunculoides ssp. repens and Eleocharis multicaulis were grown at the higher nutrient level combination in order to measure their competitive response in community. During one growing season it was observed that water level drawdown was very influential on relative species performances and ranking order, most likely through its effect on the availability of aerial carbon dioxide to the plants. However, the water level drop acted as a disturbance to Baldellia ranunculoides ssp. repens at least. Species performance generally was not influenced by the ammonium or carbon dioxide nutrient treatments. This stressed the importance of intrinsic properties of the species (their identity) and as such, their presence, to the community outcome. Furthermore, a large competitive response was observed in both Eleocharis multicaulis and Baldellia ranunculoides ssp. repens, depending on performance measure. Hence, at least in the amphibious Eleocharition and within a certain water level range, it is possible that the interactions between the occurring species are more important than the precise physicochemical characteristics, as long as species are able to survive and grow in the given environment. Put otherwise, this means that it could be that their fundamental niche is a lot larger than their realized niche, which then greatly depends on the presence and densities of species at sites. However, much more long-term experimentation on fundamental niches and interactions is needed to fully test this hypothesis. At the local scale, niches are a convenient instrument to describe conditions under which species survive, reproduce and coexist in a community. The concept is especially used to visualize how biotic interactions shape the realized niche of a species, as opposed to its physiological capabilities, also known as its fundamental niche. Why species can be the ‘winner’ only in a part of their fundamental niche, is supposed to be linked to a trade-off. For example, a high ability to quickly take advantage of new light and nutrient supplies would not be compatible with a high ability to compete in a more resource-limited environment. This trade-off is made more explicit in the competitive hierarchy model of Keddy (1989). Particularly, there is growing evidence that species are able to coexist in communities through niche separation, in the case of resource gradients often referred to as resource partitioning. At a much larger spatial scale, the realized niche concept has been broadened in order to apply to the niches that are modelled by species distribution models at biogeographical scale (also referred to as habitat suitability models or ecological niche models). At this scale, one might expect that in very different areas, mechanisms that account for the realized niche may differ. This would result in realized niches that are closer to the fundamental niches than when they were measured at a small geographical scale. Moreover, disturbances and stochastic demography may induce a reduced – or delayed – competition intensity, potentially leading to a larger realized niche. However, in this study, considerable niche differentiation between species was still found at the investigated West-European scale (chapter 3). Some other researchers tested for mechanisms of regional coexistence of species in a metacommunity, and also found evidence for niche differentiation. Results from the current study supported the expectations from classical coexistence theory by niche differentiation, at least on the regional scale, as subplot environmental heterogeneity was not assessed. If niche separation through competition is to be responsible for coexistence at the subplot scale, fine-scale environmental heterogeneity is needed to accommodate the species. Furthermore, we must accept that competition is not the only possible biotic factor that shapes the investigated plant community and leads to coexistence. For example, also facilitation might be important. Moreover, stochastic processes of species arrival at a site and subsequent (temporary) establishment may be <b>superposed</b> on deterministic <b>processes</b> of abiotic and biotic interactions, allowing more possible patterns of coexistence. The functional (dis) similarities between the five species coincided with their observed niche overlaps and differences (chapter 3). The relative species ranking could not be inferred from their strategies, however. Neither was this the case in the community experiment in chapter 4, in which partly different species were used. Here it was attributed both to the mixed strategies of all species and the high morphological plasticity of some. According to the paradigm of coexistence through niche differentiation, fitness trade-offs underpin niche separation. The match between niche patterns and plant strategy provided one indication of this, while another was that dominance hierarchies could reverse depending on the resource gradient considered. This reversal of dominance hierarchy might be the consequence of a physiological trade-off in accessing one versus another resource, and hence in fundamental niche width along these resources. The pattern along each single resource gradient was in support of the competitive hierarchy model. The restoration of the abiotic environment of target species and the enhancement of their successful colonization and establishment in a spatial context, are important keys to success in nature restoration. This thesis contributes to the knowledge that is needed to restore the Eleocharition multicaulis, with: 1) predictive niche models of five species, 2) a biogeochemical and ecosystem-wide interpretation of the requirements of the characteristic species Eleocharis multicaulis, and 3) the insight that plant-plant interactions are important to relative population performance, at least in the short term, thereby forcing the conservation biologist to consider aspects of colonization (in a spatial and temporal context), and not only environmental constraints. The thesis concludes with opportunities for further research on the Eleocharition multicaulis, suggestions in order to improve niche modelling habits by ecologists, and challenges and obstacles in the testing of ecological theory...|$|R
