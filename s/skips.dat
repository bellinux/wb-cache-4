All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter, {{which one of the}} characters reads. Structured, at times, as a nonlinear narrative, the story <b>skips</b> through space, time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogue have parallels with others through synchronicity, coincidence and repeated imagery.|$|E

However, some material had to be cut out in the final edit, as the movie was 45 minutes too long. Therefore, several locations which were used for various scenes do not appear in the final cut of the film. In Virginia Water, scenes were shot where Professor McGonagall recovers from Stunning Spells, and Burnham Beeches was used for filming the scene where Hagrid introduces his fifth-year Care of Magical Creatures class to Thestrals.

40|$|In this paper, we empirically {{explore the}} effects of various kinds of <b>skip</b> {{connections}} in stacked bidirectional LSTMs for sequential tagging. We investigate three kinds of <b>skip</b> connections connecting to LSTM cells: (a) <b>skip</b> connections to the gates, (b) <b>skip</b> connections to the internal states and (c) <b>skip</b> connections to the cell outputs. We present comprehensive experiments showing that <b>skip</b> connections to cell outputs outperform the remaining two. Furthermore, we observe that using gated identity functions as <b>skip</b> mappings works pretty well. Based on this novel <b>skip</b> connections, we successfully train deep stacked bidirectional LSTM models and obtain state-of-the-art results on CCG supertagging and comparable results on POS tagging.

The story <b>skips</b> forward two years—Zephyr and Vashyron are running their group with Leanne, taking on odd jobs across the city. Among their clients are the ruling Cardinals and people from lower strata of the tower. During their missions, they encounter instances of people's fates changing unexpectedly, going against the pre-determined path set by Zenith. They also have run-ins with Rebecca, a superhuman, mentally unstable woman from beyond Basel's borders. It is revealed that Vashyron himself faced Rebecca when she first arrived in Basel. He was fatally wounded, but was saved by Zenith, and its resultant retaliation on Rebecca broke her mind.|$|E

A message from Hyperion communicates that the player is committing {{an act of}} treason and must remove their armament and surrender. Nevertheless, the player fights their way through Selene fighters and faces the Hyperion, the game's final boss. The ending sequence depicts the player's spacecraft damaged and drifting in space. The pilot engages its thrusters and dives into an army of Selene spacecraft with the Moon in the background. An epilogue follows which states that {{the actions of the}} lone Einhänder pilot effectively ended the war by destroying the armies of both sides, leading to an eventual peace; however, the pilot's name and deeds were stricken from the records, and they are remembered only by veterans of the war.

5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's <b>skips,</b> a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new type of search trees, called <b>Skip</b> trees, which are a {{generalization}} of <b>Skip</b> lists. To be precise, there is a one-to-one mapping between the two data types which commutes with the sequential update algorithms. A <b>Skip</b> list is a data structure used to manage data bases which stores values in a sorted way and in which it is insured that the form of the <b>Skip</b> list is independent of the order of updates by using randomization techniques. <b>Skip</b> trees inherit all the properties of <b>Skip</b> lists, including the time bounds of sequential algorithms. The algorithmic improvement of the <b>Skip</b> tree type is that a concurrent algorithm on the fly approach can be designed. Among other advantages, this algorithm is more compressive than the one designed by Pugh for <b>Skip</b> lists and accepts a higher degree of concurrence because it is based on a set of local updates. From a practical point of view, although the <b>Skip</b> list should be in the main memory, <b>Skip</b> trees can be registered into a secondary [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change may}} have {{demographic}} consequences for marine top predators if {{it leads to}} altered rates of <b>skipped</b> breeding. Here we examine variation in <b>skipping</b> propensity at both the population and individual levels in common guillemots Uria aalge in relation to climate and oceanographic variables and explore {{the extent to which}} <b>skipping</b> may be adaptive or an unavoidable consequence of ecological or social constraints. We assumed a detection probability for birds present in the colony of 1. 00 and <b>skipping</b> events were defined to include both resightings of non-breeders and failures to resight individuals known to be alive (not present at the colony but resighted in future years). <b>Skipping</b> frequency was higher in years where sea surface temperatures (SST) were higher in winter (both in the current and previous year), when guillemots from our study colony disperse widely across the southern North Sea. Individuals differed consistently in their average <b>skipping</b> propensity and their responses to SST. Males and females were equally likely to <b>skip</b> on average and the frequency of <b>skipping</b> increased in the oldest age classes. Birds that <b>skipped</b> in year t had lower breeding success in year t+ 1 if they laid an egg, compared to birds that did not <b>skip</b> in year t. Lifetime reproductive output was negatively related to individual <b>skipping</b> frequency. These results imply that <b>skipping</b> is driven more by individual-specific constraints, although we cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} birds benefit from <b>skipping</b> when environmental (or internal) signals indicate that breeding in poor years could be detrimental to their residual reproductive value. While future climate change might lead to guillemots <b>skipping</b> more often due to carry-over effects from wintering to breeding periods, the net demographic impacts may be subtle as the absolute frequency of <b>skipping</b> may remain low and individuals will not be equally affected...|$|R
