500|$|During the 1980s, Savage {{attended}} Friday night {{services at}} a Jewish Synagogue Chabad house in Berkeley. In a 2003 interview on The O'Reilly Factor, Savage {{has said that}} although he is a liberal Jewish and believes in God, he attends houses of worship {{only once or twice}} a year. In his 2012 book Trickle Down Tyranny, Savage wrote: [...] "...I'm not religious. Do I believe in God? <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> sometimes I don't." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{his career}} on hold, Hunt {{continued}} recording new songs and demos, posting {{them on his}} MySpace page, while Popular gained exposure among listeners through online music sharing. In 2009, he released the compilation album Use in Case of Emergency as a free download through his website. It featured previously unreleased material recorded by Hunt prior to Popular. He also continued touring, worked on an autobiographical book of short stories, entitled Tales of Friction, and studied classical piano. Hunt also took up photography after his girlfriend purchased him a camera. He started {{out on the streets}} of Los Angeles, where he photographed subjects on street corners and discarded objects, including furniture and numerous couches he found abandoned on the streets. In an interview for PopMatters, he explained how his photographying of people there inspired him: [...] "It's sad as you can quite imagine. It's also kind of welcoming to me. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> get {{a chance to talk to}} them and hear a bit of their story. I'm not the only one out here who had an idea of trying to make it happen. Some of us are luckier than others. Some of us are more prepared than others. That's just the truth of the situation." [...] Along with photography, he was stimulated creatively after reading Legs McNeil's 1997 book Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk and relating to its themes of artistic frustration and rebelliousness.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I ain't afraid, gov'nor. All for {{the good}} of the cause. The streets is going to run with blood, so they say." [...] He spoke with a grim relish. [...] "Dreams of it, <b>sometimes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>does.</b> And {{diamonds}} and pearls rolling about in the gutter for anyone to pick up!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rich or not, I never thought; but {{it looks}} so happy, I can't tell how; and it is so far away. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>do</b> but dream it is there. You should see it in a sunset." ...|$|R
6000|$|Alton laughed. [...] "Oh, yes; <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> but {{not usually}} when I'm busy. Anyway, if the beasts hold out we'll be getting breakfast at Somasco {{in two hours}} or so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doesn't he? Well then, he may if he likes. But don't let's talk of him. Talk to {{me about}} England, Mr. Bertram. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> so long to be there--and then {{sometimes}} I don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] she pursued, [...] "I {{positively}} doubt <b>sometimes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> assure you, whether while {{matters are}} still unsettled, and the sixth or Great Seal still prevails, I may not {{one day be}} found lying stark and senseless here, as I have found so many birds!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Caroline did {{not seem}} vexed by the inquiry, but went on {{speaking}} rather {{as if she was}} examining herself as to the answer,--"Love him? <b>I</b> don't know; <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> think not. It is not as people in books love, and--and it can't be as your Agnes must love Mr. Arundel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Deronda, {{looking at}} her coolly; [...] "I think that is quite excusable <b>sometimes.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think what you were last saying was {{altogether}} artificial." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1976 Rolling Stone interview, Young {{gives an}} insight into working with the Vanda/Young team: After I {{recorded}} Pasadena our relationship just developed. They play me their songs and say: [...] "See {{what you think of}} this." [...] Usually <b>I</b> like it, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont.</b> <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> pick out something theyve written and say [...] "I want to <b>do</b> this", like <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with Things to do. (For the JPY album), we worked out some of the songs on the road. Others are worked out in the studio and some, like Standing in the Rain are produced by the studio system. Harry and George work it out and I come in later to do the vocal.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] said Kit. [...] "I'm dull, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> understand, and I now see all I lost. You {{wanted me}} to have my chance; you thought to be tied to you might keep me back? Yet I believe you loved me. Let's be frank!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I suppose I {{must put}} up with it, as best I can; but really, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> envy the colonel's little terrier, which frisks along all day, making {{excursions}} occasionally into the bush, to look for rats or mongooses. He seems to be absolutely tireless, and always ready for anything.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{never like}} the bother of consideration,' said Ferdinand, 'and in London I might have more chance of seeing {{you and other}} friends <b>sometimes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{know that it is}} not all my father supposes, but he thinks it is all my ignorance, and I have not much right to be particular.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1994, Morrissey {{rejected}} {{claims of}} racism, saying [...] "If the National Front were to hate anyone, {{it would be}} me". He added that far-right rage [...] "is simply their anger at being ignored in what {{is supposed to be}} a democratic society". In 1999, he lamented the rise of Austrian far-right politician Jörg Haider, saying: [...] "This is sad. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> believe we live in an intelligent world". In 2004, he was a founding signatory of the Unite Against Fascism pressure group.|$|R
60|$|DEAR MR. MILLER,--I cannot say for sure. It is my custom to keep {{on talking}} till I get the {{audience}} cowed. Sometimes it takes an hour and fifteen minutes, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> it in an hour.|$|R

6000|$|... "You cannot {{depend on}} me, sergeant; {{there is no}} {{certainty}} about my bowling. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> pretty fairly, at other times I get hit all over the field. No; my proper place is wicket-keeping. I should never leave {{that if we had}} two or three bowlers we could depend upon. Well, we must go in for run making.|$|E
6000|$|... "We must {{hope that}} he will, Inez, {{and that he will}} ask you to come back to Spain <b>sometimes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not care for myself, you know, for as I have told you my estate in Ireland is amply large enough for my wants; but I shall be glad, for your sake, that you should be {{reconciled}} to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘O, {{but you are}} too unjust!’ she cried. ‘You {{speak as}} though any one ever dreamed of {{laughing}} at you. But no one did. We were all pained to the heart. Even my aunt—though <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think she was not quite in good taste—you should have seen her and heard her at home! She took so much interest. Every patch in your clothes made us sorry; {{it should have been}} a sister’s work.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gerald said that, as I {{was working}} so steadily, I {{might have a}} holiday, <b>sometimes,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not ask for it too often. I have been three weeks at it, now. I am sure I can go for a day, when I like, so it will depend on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 102. These {{things did}} sink me into very deep despair; for I {{concluded}} that such things {{could not possibly}} be found amongst them that loved God. I often, when these temptations had been with force upon me, did compare myself to the case of such a child, whom some gipsy hath by force took up in her arms, and is carrying from friend and country. Kick <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and also shriek and cry; but yet I was bound in the wings of the temptation, and the wind would carry me away. I thought also of Saul, and of the evil spirit that did possess him: and did greatly fear that my condition was the same with that of his. 1 Sam. x.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't mind {{if it was}} {{a little}} bigger. I like it though; only the fact is the devil gets into me <b>sometimes,</b> and then <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want to bolt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{had warned}} {{me it would}} not have cost you much. Perhaps I am dull, but <b>{{sometimes}}</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> understand. I thought I might, like Austin, mend my fortune; he held my post and married your sister. You knew, and I expect you were amused. The thing was a joke! Well, sometimes I saw I was a fool, but I wasn't logical long. When you're about one isn't logical. I meant to mend my fortune." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So, {{you just}} see," [...] she continued, [...] "what you've got to manage. A {{household}} without any rule; where servants {{have it all}} their own way, do what they please, and have what they please, except so far as I, with my feeble health, have kept up government. I keep my cowhide about, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> lay it on; but the exertion is always too much for me. If St. Clare would only have this thing done as others do--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that was}} very {{careless}} of me. I am so busy that <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> forget to <b>do</b> things. But <b>I</b> must be going, so goodbye my dears; I hope the dolls won't bother you too much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is important," [...] {{said the}} man, [...] "that I should know if vessels have {{anchored}} here, for if they be merchantmen <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>do</b> business with them." ...|$|R
60|$|VOICE. Because you'll forget and I'll forget. Oh, Pip, don't forget! I {{always loved}} you, though <b>I</b> was cross <b>sometimes.</b> If <b>I</b> ever <b>did</b> {{anything}} that you didn't like, say you forgive me now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Greenbrier," [...] said Merritt, with apology in his tone, [...] "in {{a way you}} are right. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{feel like}} I was being raised on the bottle. But, I tell you, New York is comfortable--comfortable. There's {{something}} about it--the sights and the crowds, {{and the way it}} changes every day, and the very air of it that seems to tie a one-mile-long stake rope around a man's neck, with the other end fastened somewhere about Thirty-fourth Street. I don't know what it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do try; I wish I {{was as good}} as Ada, but I am so naughty and so noisy that I do {{not know}} what to do. Every day when I say my prayers I think about being quiet, and not idling at my lessons, and <b>{{sometimes}}</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> stop in time, and behave better, but sometimes I forget, and I do not mind what I am about, and my voice gets loud, and I let the things tumble down and make a noise, and so it was yesterday.' Here she looked much disposed to cry.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} wait," [...] she said. [...] "If {{you really want}} to give me something, I will let you--out of my brother's money, of course, I mean," [...] she added. [...] "I haven't {{anything}} saved at all, or I wouldn't have that. But one day you shall take me out and buy me a dress and hat. You can tell Arthur directly you write to him. I don't mind that, for <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> feel ashamed--I did the other night to have you sit with me there, and to feel that I was dressed so very differently from all of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} in that, madam," [...] answered the gardener; [...] "it may have been that during the story <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>did</b> think that <b>I</b> myself might have been Jaqui." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I will!" [...] {{answered}} Lowiny, promptly, {{and with}} emphasis. [...] "Not a mortal soul shall know anything on't, and I won't {{so much as}} talk of it in my sleep, as <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>do,</b> if <b>I</b> can any way help it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Greendale {{has been}} a great deal braver than I have, sir," [...] Anna said, quietly. [...] "She has been wonderfully brave, and though she is very good to say that I have borne up well, I know very well that I have not been as brave as I ought; and I could not help {{breaking}} down and crying <b>sometimes,</b> for <b>I</b> <b>did</b> think that we should never get home again." ...|$|R
