5|$|Due to the 'challenge' {{format of}} Stanley Cup play before 1915, {{there is often}} {{confusion}} about how many Stanley Cups the <b>Senators</b> should be given credit for: nine, ten or eleven. The <b>Senators</b> were Stanley Cup champions {{at the end of}} nine hockey seasons without dispute. In another two seasons, 1905–06 and 1909–10, the <b>Senators</b> won Stanley Cup challenges but were not champions {{at the end of the}} season. The Hockey Hall of Fame and the National Hockey League agree that the <b>Senators</b> of 1906 were champions but disagree on whether the <b>Senators</b> were champions in 1910. In both seasons, the <b>Senators</b> were the undisputed defending champions, and during that year's hockey season, the <b>Senators</b> won Stanley Cup challenges. However, by the end of both hockey seasons, they were no longer holders of the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Each state elects two <b>senators</b> by statewide {{popular vote}} every six years. The {{terms of the}} two <b>senators</b> are {{staggered}} {{so that they are}} not elected in the same year.

In December 2016, the Senate passed a motion to fund the Independent <b>Senators</b> Group for the next two fiscal years. As of January 2017, the Parliament of Canada website distinguishes between non-affiliated <b>Senators</b> who belong to the Independent <b>Senators</b> Group (ISG) and those who do not.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the <b>senators</b> and the plebeian tribunes began to grow closer. The Senate began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes began to feel indebted to the Senate. As the tribunes and the <b>senators</b> grew closer, plebeian <b>senators</b> began to {{routinely}} secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new <b>senators</b> from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of plebeian <b>senators.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bordagaray {{made his}} {{professional}} baseball debut in {{minor league baseball}} with the Sacramento <b>Senators</b> of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) during the 1931 season. They originally gave him a three-week tryout without pay, {{so that he could}} retain his amateur status; {{at the end of the}} tryout, the <b>Senators</b> offered Bordagaray his first professional contract. At only 20 years of age, Bordagaray's father needed to provide his consent. Though his father initially refused and threatened to take the <b>Senators</b> to court, he changed his mind after visiting his son. Fresno State's football coach, Stan Borleske, attempted to negotiate Bordagaray's release, but <b>Senators</b> owner Lewis Moreing refused.|$|E

5|$|Caligula {{reviewed}} Tiberius's {{records of}} treason trials and decided, {{based on their}} actions during these trials, that numerous <b>senators</b> were not trustworthy.

5|$|Even liberal <b>senators</b> were {{agitated}} by {{the proposed}} changes, fearing their own lands would be confiscated. <b>Senators</b> arranged for other tribunes {{to oppose the}} reforms. Tiberius then appealed to the people, and argued that a tribune who opposes {{the will of the}} people in favour of the rich is not a true tribune. The <b>senators</b> were left with only one constitutional response – to threaten prosecution after Tiberius's term as a tribune ended. This necessitated Tiberius to stand for a second term.|$|E

5|$|Founded and {{established}} by Ottawa {{real estate developer}} Bruce Firestone, the Ottawa <b>Senators</b> are the second National Hockey League (NHL) franchise to have the Ottawa <b>Senators</b> name. The original Ottawa <b>Senators,</b> founded in 1883, had a famed history, winning 11 Stanley Cups and played in the NHL from 1917 until 1934. On December 6, 1990, after a two-year public campaign by Firestone to return the NHL to Ottawa, the NHL awarded a new franchise, which began play in the 1992–93 season.|$|E
5|$|In October 1992, at {{the first}} game of the current Ottawa <b>Senators</b> NHL club, banners were raised to commemorate Stanley Cups in nine seasons, {{excluding}} 1906 and 1910. In media guides published by the club, they listed the original <b>Senators</b> as nine-time winners. This changed in March 2003, when the team raised banners for the 1906 and 1910 years to join the other nine banners hanging at the Corel Centre. The club and the NHL now list the original <b>Senators</b> as eleven-time winners.|$|E
5|$|In the 1929–30 season, {{with cash}} still hemorrhaging, the team {{transferred}} two scheduled home games to Atlantic City (one each against the New York Rangers and New York Americans), two to Detroit, {{and one to}} Boston. The <b>Senators</b> rallied, however, {{to make the playoffs}} for a final time, finishing third in the Canadian Division. The <b>Senators</b> faced off against the New York Rangers in a two-game total-goals series. In the last NHL playoff game in Ottawa until 1996, the <b>Senators</b> tied the Rangers 1–1 on March 28, 1930, but lost game two in New York 5–1 to lose the series 6 goals to 2. The season also marked the debut of future star Syd Howe with the <b>Senators</b> while long-time star Frank Nighbor was sold to Toronto.|$|E

5|$|One {{month before}} the <b>Senators</b> were to open the new Palladium, after three-straight last place finishes, and poor {{attendance}} at the Civic Centre, the <b>Senators</b> organization was in turmoil.

5|$|Since most <b>senators</b> were former magistrates, {{the senate}} became bound {{together}} by {{a strong sense of}} collegiality. At any given point in time, many of the senate's most senior members were ex-Consuls, which facilitated the creation of a bond between the presiding Consul and those senior members. In addition, the Consul was always chosen from senate, and as such he usually held similar ideals as did his fellow <b>senators.</b> When his annual term ended, he returned to their ranks, and so he was unlikely to stand against his fellow <b>senators.</b> Before the enactment of the Ovinian Law, Consuls appointed new <b>senators,</b> but after the enactment of this law, Censors appointed new <b>senators,</b> which caused the senate to become even more independent of the presiding Consul. In addition, the Ovinian Law all but required that ex-magistrates be appointed to the senate, and as such, the process by which Censors appointed new members to the senate became quite objective. This further enhanced the competence, and thus the prestige, of the senate.|$|E

5|$|The Gateshead <b>Senators</b> (originally the Gateshead International <b>Senators)</b> are an American {{football}} club formed in 1988 when the Newcastle <b>Senators,</b> {{who played at}} Northern Rugby Club, moved across the Tyne {{to play at the}} Gateshead International Stadium. The club has had mixed fortunes but their most successful season came in 1999. Having won eight of their nine games in the regular season, the team won the Division One North title and advanced to the end-of-season playoffs. After beating the Merseyside Nighthawks 430 in the quarter-finals, the <b>Senators</b> defeated the Essex Spartans 3319 in the semi-finals to reach the championship final. At the Saffron Lane Stadium in Leicester, the <b>Senators</b> faced the Bristol Aztecs. In a tight encounter, the <b>Senators</b> claimed the Division One British American Football League title with a 72 victory. The club reached the playoffs again in the next three seasons but were unable to replicate that success, and after a season voluntarily spent in Division Two in 2003, returned to Division One North in 2004. They continue to play in that division, and in the 2012 season failed to make the playoffs after recording five wins and five defeats in their ten games.|$|E
