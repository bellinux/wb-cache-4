40|$|Abstract:- In the {{previous}} studies by Leung et al. [1, 2, 3, 4], {{a set of}} software metrics, named Neural Metrics that are applicable in supervised feedforward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and provide measures of the network quality and training complexity, was proposed. This study extends the work by empirically evaluating the neural metrics against the standard Backpropagation Algorithm (BPA) across several types of benchmark application problems. The result of the evaluation was, {{for each type of}} problem, a specification of values of all neural metrics and network parameters which can be used to successfully solve the <b>same</b> <b>or</b> <b>similar</b> <b>type</b> of problem. With such a specification, neural users can reduce the uncertainty and hence time in choosing the reliable network details for solving the <b>same</b> <b>or</b> <b>similar</b> <b>type</b> of problem. In addition, users are provided with {{a better understanding of the}} algorithmic complexity of the problem by referring to the values of the neural metrics in the specification. They may also use the specified neural metric values as reference points for similar experiments with a view to obtaining a better or sub-optimal solution for the problem. Thus, if the values of neural metrics obtained in a further experiment are less than that reported in the specification, the experiment may be considered to be an improved or more efficient approach than the standard BPA...|$|E

Academic colleagues sometimes reinvent the wheels to recreate the <b>same</b> <b>or</b> <b>similar</b> <b>type</b> of knowledge and intellectual work. As the forum is a popular online teaching tool, this research focuses on the examination of how knowledge, created by a learning and teaching community in forums within an online learning environment, can be reused when a subject is run again or handed over to a different colleague later. It is qualitative interpretive research. To investigate the sharing and reuse of knowledge amongst academics, a focus group was conducted with eight experienced subject coordinators who have used online forums in teaching. They were from three different university schools and different disciplines. The participants produced a plethora of rich information regarding potential knowledge reuse about subjects, focusing on subject contents, assignment help, class discussions, learning difficulties and experiences. This study suggests {{that the development of}} a knowledge-sharing culture, university policies, or knowledge management leadership can effectively encourage sharing and reuse of knowledge within a university environment...|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional {{reconstruction}} of the anterior mouth floor and ventral tongue after ablative surgery can be achieved using several techniques. The ideal reconstruction should be accomplished with the <b>same</b> <b>or</b> <b>similar</b> <b>type</b> of tissue, and cheek axial myomucosal flaps based on the branches of facial or internal maxillary arteries seem ideal for this purpose. From March 2005 to May 2007, 23 patients underwent cheek axial myomucosal flap reconstruction after oral cancer surgical ablation. Thanks to their thinness and pliability, these flaps were frequently shaped to obtain an accurate reconstruction. According to Whetzel’s hypothesis, an intraoral flap designed to include the axial vessel of one area can safely carry the mucosa of a neighbouring vascular area. The authors describe a large buccinator myomucosal island flap based on {{the branches of the}} facial artery and formed in a trilobed shape in order to capture the adjacent buccal mucosal angiosome from the internal maxillary artery. The flap provided the correct anatomical oral reconstruction for the anterior mouth floor and ventral tongue. The function of the tongue, oral intake and mastication were not impaired.

40|$|Abridged) We {{present the}} LogN-LogS and spatial {{distributions}} of X-ray point sources in seven Galactic Bulge (GB) fields within 4 deg from the Galactic Center (GC). We compare {{the properties of}} 1159 X-ray point sources discovered in our deep (100 ks) Chandra observations of three low extinction Window fields near the GC with the X-ray sources in the other GB fields centered around Sgr B 2, Sgr C, the Arches Cluster and Sgr A* using Chandra archival data. To reduce the systematic errors induced by the uncertain X-ray spectra of the sources coupled with field-and-distance dependent extinction, we classify the X-ray sources using quantile analysis and estimate their fluxes accordingly. The result indicates the GB X-ray population is highly concentrated at the center, more heavily than the stellar distribution models. We also compare the total X-ray and infrared surface brightness using the Chandra and Spitzer observations of the regions. The radial distribution of the total infrared surface brightness from the 3. 6 band μm images appears to resemble the radial distribution of the X-ray point sources better than predicted by the stellar distribution models. Assuming a simple power law model for the X-ray spectra, the closer to the GC the intrinsically harder the X-ray spectra appear, but adding an iron emission line at 6. 7 keV in the model allows the spectra of the GB X-ray sources to be largely consistent across the region. This implies {{that the majority of}} these GB X-ray sources can be of the <b>same</b> <b>or</b> <b>similar</b> <b>type.</b> Their X-ray luminosity and spectral properties support the idea that the most likely candidate is magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs), primarily intermediate polars (IPs). Their observed number density is also consistent with the majority being IPs. Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables, accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journa...|$|E
40|$|More than {{a decade}} ago, three viral oncoproteins, {{adenovirus}} type 9 E 4 -ORF 1, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax, and high-risk human papillomavirus E 6, were found to encode a related carboxyl-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) that mediates interactions with {{a select group of}} cellular PDZ proteins. Recent studies have shown that many other viruses also encode PBM-containing proteins that bind to cellular PDZ proteins. Interestingly, these recently recognized viruses include not only some with oncogenic potential (hepatitis B virus, rhesus papillomavirus, cottontail rabbit papillomavirus) but also many without this potential (influenza virus, Dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, rabies virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus). Examination of the cellular PDZ proteins that are targets of viral PBMs reveals that the viral proteins often interact with the <b>same</b> <b>or</b> <b>similar</b> <b>types</b> of PDZ proteins, most notably Dlg 1 {{and other members of the}} membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family, as well as Scribble. In addition, cellular PDZ protein targets of viral PBMs commonly control tight junction formation, cell polarity establishment, and apoptosis. These findings reveal a new theme in virology wherein many different virus families encode proteins that bind and perturb the function of cellular PDZ proteins. The inhibition or perturbation of the function of cellular PDZ proteins appears to be a widely used strategy for viruses to enhance their replication, disseminate in the host, and transmit to new hosts...|$|R

TbmR and TbuT each exhibited activation of both PtbmA and PtbuA 1, with toluene, benzene, and chlorobenzene serving as strong effectors. These results strongly suggest that TbmR is an NtrC-like regulator which is functionally homologous to TbuT, and they provide evidence for the evolutionary "recruitment" of the <b>same</b> <b>or</b> a <b>similar</b> <b>type</b> of regulator for both monooxygenase pathways...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{extensive}} field sampling programme within the European Union STAR project, replicate macroinvertebrate samples were taken using the STAR-AQEM sampling method at each of 2 – 13 sites of varying ecological quality within each of 15 stream types spread over 12 countries throughout Europe. The STAR-AQEM method requires the sub-sampling and taxonomic identification of at least one-sixth of the sample and at least 700 individuals. Replicate sub-samples were also taken at most of these sites. Sub-sampling effects caused more than 50 % of the overall variance between replicate samples values for 12 of the 27 macroinvertebrate metrics analysed and was generally greatest for metrics that depend {{on the number of}} taxa present. The sampling precision of each metric was estimated by the overall replicate sampling variance as a percentage Psamp of the total variance in metric values within a stream type. Average over all stream types, the three Saprobic indices had the lowest percentage sampling variances with median values of only 3 – 6 %. Most of the metrics had typical replicate sampling variances of 8 – 18 % of the total variability within a stream type; this gives rise to estimated rates of mis-classifying sites to ecological status class of between 22 and 55 % with an average of about 40 %. This suggests that the precision of such metrics based on the STAR-AQEM method is only sufficient to indicate gross changes in the ecological status of sites, but there will be considerable uncertainty in the assignment of sites to adjacent status classes. These estimates can be used to provide information on the effects of STAR-AQEM sampling variation on the expected uncertainty in multi-metric assessments of the ecological status of sites in the <b>same</b> <b>or</b> <b>similar</b> stream <b>types,</b> where only one sample has been taken at a point in time and thus there is no replicatio...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The paper investigates how {{customers}} {{may contribute}} to radical innovation in consultancy services {{and what are the}} conditions needed for customers to involve in such radical service innovations. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a qualitative case study approach including rich descriptions based primarily on interviews to investigate an extreme example of successful customer involvement in the development of radical service innovations in Ramboll, a leading Scandinavian engineering consultancy. Findings – Our study reveals that customers may be involved in radical innovation processes to different degrees. However involving customers actively in radical services innovation require a relationship between the customer company and the service provider that might be described as a partnership in which ongoing learning is taking place to develop new solutions. Our findings reveal that unsolved problems as well as personal trust are keys in order to make customers involve in radical service innovations. Customers involved actively are further characterized by possessing high expertise and extraordinary personal engagement. Research limitations/implications – As in all case studies, the main limitation of our study is the generalizability of the findings. More cases would help to shed light on the generalizability of the findings across other radical innovation projects within the <b>same</b> company <b>or</b> in <b>similar</b> <b>type</b> of companies.

40|$|Heritage, {{cultural}} and community assets (HCA) are those assets that are {{held for the}} duration of their physical lives because of their unique cultural, historical, geographical, scientific, and/or environmental attributes. They assist holders of the assets to meet their objectives in regard to exhibition, education, research and preservation, all of which are directed at providing a cultural service to the community. In the context of this paper, heritage, {{cultural and}} community assets include, {{but are not limited to}} general collections in libraries, heritage collections in libraries, museum collections, art gallery collections, historical documents, historical monuments and heritage assets held in local authority trusts. The imposition of regulatory measures requiring public sector organizations to provide annual financial reports prepared on an accounting basis comparable to those for the private sector, and incorporated an obligation to disclose at economic values all assets held. For public benefit entities holding heritage, cultural and community assets (HCA), this reporting requirement has been particularly problematic, entailing substantive change to public accounting policy. The valuation of HCA will provide information to management and/or the public to allow them to: •	have a complete picture of the financial value of the assets at a particular time; •	make comparisons of changes in the financial value of the assets over time; •	allocate new funds between different types of assets; •	re-allocate resources to higher priority assets through the sale of existing low priority assets; and •	develop appropriate internal management practices and procedures. To best achieve these purposes the financial information provided should be current. If an historical cost approach is used, no account is taken of specific or general price movements since purchase, comparability between financial statements is reduced and distortions may be introduced as to the value of components of the collections assets. Fair value is determined by reference to the best available market evidence. Where available, this should be based on the current market selling price for the <b>same</b> <b>or</b> a <b>similar</b> <b>type</b> of asset. However, many types of heritage and community assets are of a unique nature for which no market selling price can be observed or for which no relevant market exists. In these circumstances, the asset’s fair value can be estimated using an income or depreciated replacement cost approach. Where a heritage or community asset cannot be reliably measured it should not be recognised in the financial report. Instead, it should be disclosed in the notes to the financial report.
