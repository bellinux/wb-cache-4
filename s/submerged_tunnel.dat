40|$|AbstractSubmerged {{floating}} tunnels (SFTs) weigh {{roughly the}} same as the surrounding water. The loads on the tunnel depend on the variation of the forces on the tunnel. The forces come from variation in traffic, current, temperature, waves, weight of water, weight of concrete, growth on the tunnel, wear of asphalt, dust and debris, relaxation of prestress and shrinkage and creep in the concrete. The last six variations are slow and can be counteracted by altering weights in the tunnel. All structures above sea level are subject to gravity, which tends to limit their spans. In SFTs buoyancy counteracts gravity. This speaks for longer spans, but the slope of roads limit the depth to raise ratio of downward arched SFTs. This tends to limit the free spans. In this article the design of SFTs is discussed. Finally there is a comparison between materials needed for two SFTs and a suspension bridge between Vallavik and Bu in Eidfjord in western Norway. The fjord is ‚àº 500 ¬†m deep.

40|$|Reinertsen AS is {{developing}} a bridge crossing concept to cross the Sognefjord in Norway. The concept consists of floating bridge and <b>submerged</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The <b>submerged</b> <b>tunnel</b> is exposed to ship collisions from passing ship traffic. A protective ship collision barrier is used to protect the exposed part of the <b>submerged</b> <b>tunnel.</b> A design of the collision barrier is proposed. The barrier is made of Aluminium. There are some special considerations one {{must take into account}} when using aluminium. Aluminium that is heat treated has a reduction in strength, referred to as the reduction in heat affected zone. Different alloys react differently to heat treatments. Some have a large reduction in HAZ, while some are not affected at all. Two alloys are used and studied in this thesis. Alloy 5083 with temper O and H 12, and Alloy 6082 with temper T 6. A Ramberg-Osgood material description is used to describe the material properties of Aluminium alloys in the Finite element analysis. A failure criterion is used based on design principles found in Eurocode 9. The failure criteria are only depending on yield stress of the alloy, which gives reason to doubt the goodness of the criteria when strain failure for an aluminium alloy depends on many other factors. An analysis of a stiffened panel subjected to lateral and axial loading is done. The loading {{is in the form of}} a rigid sphere and rigid plate, moving with a constant velocity trough the plate. A comparison between the use of alloy 5083 O and alloy 5083 H 12 is carried out. The effect of heat affected zone is also studied. The analysis showed that the impact stresses dominate more than the reduction in the HAZ regarding strain localisation and fracture pattern. There is a reduction in the resistance force capacity because of HAZ, both in axial and lateral direction. A collision analysis of a model of a bow and barrier is carried out. The design of the ship model is based on the cruise ship MS Balmoral. The barrier design is based on local and global strength considerations. The barrier is modelled as a straight rectangular cylinder, with clamped ends. A collision analysis using LSDYNA is carried out. The analysis consists of sending the bow trough the collision barrier. The analysis showed that the design of the barrier must be strengthened. The bow does receive little damage, and the barrier is too weak to protect the tunnel. A model of the bridge concept is made in USFOS, with the intension to carry out a global collision -response analysis. This was not finished, due to time limitations...|$|E
