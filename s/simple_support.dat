5000|$|A <b>simple</b> <b>support</b> (pin or roller) is {{equivalent}} to a point force on the beam which is adjusted {{in such a way}} as to fix the position of the beam at that point. A fixed support or clamp, {{is equivalent}} to the combination of a point force and a point torque which is adjusted {{in such a way as}} to fix both the position and slope of the beam at that point. Point forces and torques, whether from supports or directly applied, will divide a beam into a set of segments, between which the beam equation will yield a continuous solution, given four boundary conditions, two at each end of the segment. Assuming that the product EI is a constant, and defining [...] where F is the magnitude of a point force, and [...] where M is the magnitude of a point torque, the boundary conditions appropriate for some common cases is given in the table below. The change in a particular derivative of w across the boundary as x increases is denoted by [...] followed by that derivative.

Other methods to solve the structural analysis of this issue include matrix as well as several finite-element procedures.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, a {{residual}} stress analysis {{is carried out}} on symmetric cross-ply and angle-ply thermoplastic <b>simple</b> <b>supported</b> and clamped supported laminated plates for transverse loading. Low density polyethylene thermoplastic matrix (LDPE) and woven Ni–Cr fibers are used to produce the composite plates by using molds. First order shear deformation theory and nine nodes Lagrangian finite element are used. Mathematical formulation is given for the elasto-plastic stress analysis of a laminated plate for small deformations. Yield points and stresses are obtained for symmetric <b>simple</b> <b>supported</b> and clamped supported laminated plates. Residual stresses in thermoplastic plates are given in the tables. The expansion of plastic zones is illustrated for 50, 100 and 150 loading steps. Yield points {{and the expansion of}} plastic zones are compared for different plates. Mechanical properties of a layer are obtained experimentally. KEY WORDS: woven Ni–Cr termoplastic, laminated composite plates, finite element method, residual stress, transverse loading...|$|R
