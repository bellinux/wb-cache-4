25|$|Modern ploughs {{are usually}} {{multiple}} reversible ploughs, {{mounted on a}} tractor via a three-point linkage.

The hydraulic system of the tractor is used to lift and reverse the implement, as well as to adjust furrow width and depth.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is force effect {{analysis}} of ploughing rigs. MSC Adams software was used for mathematical-physical model drafting and subsequent evaluation of measured data from tensometrical load sensing. Designed model was utilized for force reactions calculations under the driving wheels of a tractor using analysis of spatial system of forces of tractors three point hitch. Field measurement data and data from MSC Adams software were tabular and graphically processed. Dependencies between plough and tractor connection setting and output performance of ploughing rigs were clarified. Results from experimental measurement with fully-mounted plough point out on the utilization of longitudinal and lateral position of ploughs CG for reducing of difference in load between furrow and land wheel with properly adjusted connection between plough and tractor. A result from experimental measurement with <b>semi-mounted</b> plough confirms the fact of significant difference in vertical load between rear axle wheels. This negative phenomenon could be eliminated with usage of traction cylinder localized in construction of <b>semi-mounted</b> ploughs over the horizontal joint. Correct adjustment of tractors three point hitch in case of fully-mounted ploughs and utilization of traction cylinder in case of <b>semi-mounted</b> ploughs have got positive influence on fuel consumption and field performance of ploughing rigs...|$|E

40|$|In the {{literary}} {{part of the}} diploma thesis, {{a brief overview of}} the current state in the tractor design has been done, concentrating onto such elements that lead to lowering of fuel consumption. The practical part is based on the realized solution. The target of the measurement was to prove the influence of adjusting of the three-point hitch onto the output parameters of ploughing sets, consisting of the Zetor Forterra 140 HSX tractor and Kverneland 150 B mounted plough or Kverneland PN 100 <b>semi-mounted</b> plough. The essence of the measurement was gradual shortening of the upper linkage of the three-point hitch, whereas simultaneously with shortening of the linkage, the force on the linkage was rising. The force was measured by means of strain gauge Hotinger U 2 A. In case of the mounted plough it has been proved that shortening of the upper linkage causes rising of the force. That shifts part of the plough weight onto the rear wheels of the tractor, resulting in lower wheel slipping and lower fuel consumption...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} a current {{scientific and technical}} problem pertaining to creation of multi-bridge wheeled chassis for highly efficient modular sugar beet harvesters of large cargo capacity and, in particular, to selection of main parameters of chassis and wheeled drive. Such machines are designed for operation under complicated soil and climatic conditions during sugar beet harvesting. Methodological rules and regulations {{have been developed for}} solution of problems pertaining to scientifically sunstantiated selection of a manufactured or developed wheeled chassis model, building-block parameters of a working device and a chassis, rational control algorithm of the unit running system while using a specified (domestic or foreign) <b>semi-mounted</b> equipment for beet harvesting. While solving the problem theoretical provisions for wheeled vehicles regarding specific features of a wheeled chassis for modular sugar beet harvesters with extensive mechanical or hydrostatic wheel drive of a multi-bridge propulsion system have been developed in the paper. Calculated and theoretical expressions for determination of main parameters for a wheeled chassis have been obtained and they include physical quantities of operational conditions that explicitly determine its working process. Such approach has made it possible to realize the obtained expressions as a software application which is suitable for analysis of main parameters in respect of the investigated harvester chassis and rational parameters of a branch wheel drive and also for a complete set of tires in the case when a sugar beet harvester is designed on the basis of wheeled chassis according to the selected scheme. Investigations have theoretical significance and represent practical interest for development spesialists of new modular multi-bridge sugar beet harvesters. </p...|$|E
40|$|Tractive {{efficiency}} and fuel consumption of Massey Ferguson (MF 399) and John Deere (JD 4230) tractors during plowing with moldboard plow were evaluated and compared. The {{tests were conducted}} at the Experimental Station, College of Agriculture, Shiraz University, in a field with sandy clay soil at average moisture content of 18 % d. b. from zero to 30 cm depth. A randomized complete block design with a 4 3 factorial was used in three replications. The treatments consisted of two types of tractors, MF 399 and JD 4230, each at two levels of axle load (standard and liquid ballasted) and three levels of plowing depth, shallow (15 - 20 cm), medium (20 - 25 cm) and deep (25 - 30 cm) using a <b>semi-mounted</b> 4 -bottom moldboard plow. In all treatments, the tractor engine speed was set at rated rpm (2000 and 2200 for MF 399 and JD 4230, respectively) and forward speed was kept constant at about 4. 5 ± 5 km/hr. The measured and calculated parameters included: drawbar pull, rolling resistance, wheel slip, tractive {{efficiency and}} fuel consumption. The results indicated that tractive efficiency of MF 399 in deep plowing increased from 36. 5 % to 53 % with ballasting the drive wheels, even though the improved traction was not {{comparable to that of}} JD 4230 (64 %) at the same plowing depth. However, at ballasted condition it is comparable to JD 4230 at shallow and medium depth plowing due to its lower fuel consumption. Using ballasted JD 4230 for shallow depth plowing is not economically justified due to the excessive fuel consumption and may cause soil compaction due to the lower than optimum wheel slippage. Generally, using MF 399 is recommended for lower draft and JD 4230 for higher draft tillage operations. Otherwise, MF 399 will encounter severe reduction in tractive efficiency and excessive increase in fuel consumption and JD 4230 will cause soil compaction...|$|E
40|$|The new Community {{rules on}} the {{reduction}} of risks {{to the environment and}} food safety require a breakthrough innovation in all sectors especially in agriculture where there is a strong pressure due to the remarkable use of pesticides and herbicides. In this context, it’s a necessary reinterpretation of the classic management methods to a new modern agricultural concept the "integrated agronomic approach" for a targeted individual care and aware of the plant, of the biotic and environmental components that interacting. The operating units of "agricultural mechanics and mechanization" of Pisa and Florence have the task of establishing the actuators in the final three specific contexts: wheat, corn and olives. In the first case, the robot will perform chemical weed control, while in the corn case will be used only mechanical and thermal physical tools. For the third scenario we worked on the design and testing of an automatic unit for the pesticides application sprayed on crops, especially olive trees and woody crops for biomass energy production. The objective of the Unit of Florence is the realization of a sprayer with distribution based on the geometry in intensive and super-intensive olive trees. A complex air assisted sprayer has been designed and realized as concentration of the latest innovation of the international research integrated in the RHEA robot system. The <b>semi-mounted</b> sprayer applied to small autonomous tractor equipped with many typologies of sensor is able to recognize the presence, shape and thickness of the various horizontal bands of the canopy by adjusting the activation, the amount, the type of spraying. Moreover, is possible, separately on each band, to control the direction of air diffusors and the airblast flow rate in relation to the presence or thickness of the canopy. An innovative device system to control dose application proportionally to the canopy band thickness has been applied by an high frequency solenoid valve driven by variable duty cycle controller. New RHEA spray concept, has the aims to follow the rules imposed by the European Union to reduce pollution caused by then distribution of pesticides...|$|E
