50|$|As {{manufacturing}} costs declined, 24-pin printers gradually replaced 9-pin printers. Twenty-four pin printers {{reached a}} dot-density of 360×360 dpi, a marketing figure aimed at potential buyers of competing ink-jet and laser-printers. 24-pin NLQ fonts generally used a dot-density of 360×180, the highest allowable with <b>single-pass</b> <b>printing.</b> Multipass NLQ was abandoned, as most manufacturers felt the marginal quality improvement did not justify the tradeoff in speed. Most 24-pin printers offered 2 or more NLQ typefaces, but {{the rise of}} WYSIWYG software and GUI environments such as Microsoft Windows ended the usefulness of NLQ.|$|E
40|$|Inkjet-printed metal {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} intensively studied for microelectronic applications including {{both physical and}} chemical sensors, and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). However, printed feature broadening is frequently observed due to the coalescence of un-dried ink, reducing achievable resolution. Increasing substrate temperature and reducing print rates are two common mitigation techniques, each with drawbacks. Here a novel interlacing method is introduced as an alternative strategy to manage droplet coalescence. The desired geometry is sampled into multiple sub-patterns and then printed sequentially, to yield the complete pattern. The interlacing sub-sampling matrix is selected according to the desired resolution and printing parameters to isolate each un-dried ink droplet during deposition. Printed geometries are found to retain single droplet resolution using this method. A comparison is made between samples with direct (<b>single-pass)</b> <b>printing</b> and interlaced printing. High-resolution silver planar resistors are constructed and characterized for their application as printed temperature sensors. © 2014 IEEE. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
