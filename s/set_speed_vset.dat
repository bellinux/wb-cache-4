When the cruise control is engaged, the throttle can still be used to accelerate the car, but once the pedal is released the car will then slow down until it reaches the previously <b>set</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A hit-and-miss {{engine is}} a type of {{four-stroke}} internal combustion engine that is controlled by a governor to operate a <b>set</b> <b>speed.</b> It was conceived in the late 19th century and produced by various companies from the 1890s through approximately the 1940s. The name comes from the speed control on these engines: they are designed to fire ("hit") only when operating at or below a <b>set</b> <b>speed,</b> and to cycle without firing ("miss") when they exceed their <b>set</b> <b>speed.</b> This is as compared to the [...] "throttle governed" [...] method of speed control. The sound made when the engine is running without a load is a distinctive [...] "POP whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh POP" [...] as the engine fires and then coasts until the speed decreases and it fires again to maintain its average speed.|$|R

40|$|As a {{promising}} {{candidate for a}} phase change material of a highly fast and scalable non-volatile memory, Ge-doped SbTe with a certain range of Sb and Te content has interesting material properties such as a low melting temperature, fast crystallization with a high crystallization temperature, and a low electrical resistivity. Using test vehicles based on a cell structure with a contact pore of 100 to 200 nm in size, Ge-doped SbTe of two different compositions (Sb/Te atomic ratio of 4. 53 and 2. 08) were examined and compared with Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 in term of important device characteristics such as <b>SET</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>SET</b> resistance as well as RESET current. Between the two compositions, Ge-doped SbTe of the higher Sb content was found superior by far in <b>SET</b> <b>speed,</b> which is considered to arise from fast growth-dominated crystallization characteristics of the material combined {{with the nature of}} a SET process within the device that does not necessarily require nucleation of crystallites in the presence of movable inter-phase boundaries. Ge-doped SbTe of the higher Sb content was also shown to provide a higher <b>SET</b> <b>speed</b> by more than two orders of magnitude and a lower SET resistance by about one tenth than Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5. As for RESET current, the material was observed to require a higher current than Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 for a stable operation but there appears much room for improvement with a proper understanding of the apparently incomplete RESET at a much lower current level than the one for a stable RESET. Lastly, a derivative of Ge-doped SbTe of the higher Sb/Te content was formed by addition of nitrogen, which turned out to provide an effective means to reduction in RESET current without significantly decreasing <b>SET</b> <b>speed...</b>|$|R
50|$|The rate {{at which}} pattern data is played is defined by a <b>speed</b> <b>setting.</b> Each row in the pattern data lasts one {{vertical}} blanking (or 0.02 seconds) times the current <b>speed</b> <b>setting.</b> The <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> varied from 1 to 255.In later versions of the format, the vertical blanking was replaced with an adjustable time period staying in the range 0.078 seconds. The old <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> command was replaced with a new one {{that was used to}} change both the old <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> and the new adjustable time period. Unfortunately, some of the old functionality was broken, because the new <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> command had an identical code value to the old command. Values in the range 31 were interpreted as the old speed settings, but other values were regarded as modifications to the adjustable time period. Hence, values in the range 255 used in some old songs broke in new versions of the player.|$|R
