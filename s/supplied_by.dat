40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the effect of adoption intensity of GM crops on off‐farm labor <b>supply</b> <b>by</b> farm households. Using ARMS data in 2004, 2005 and 2006, we estimate a two stage simultaneous Tobit model and find that adoption intensity of GM crops has a negative impact on off‐farm labor <b>supply</b> <b>by</b> operators and a positive impact on off‐farm labor <b>supply</b> <b>by</b> spouse. This may be due to the comparative advantage of operators and spouses. Our results find that GM crops adoption has different but significant implications on off‐farm labor <b>supply</b> <b>by</b> operators and spouses and underscores the importance of understanding farm households’ decisions to explain behaviors of farm businesses in the United States.
