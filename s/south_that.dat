5|$|Al-Kilabi led {{his army}} along the Jaxartes valley to Ferghana, and laid siege to it while devastating the {{surrounding}} countryside. At this point, the Umayyad army {{became aware that}} the Turgesh khagan Suluk was advancing against them with an army stronger than their own. Abandoning the siege, the Muslim army retreated so hastily towards the <b>south</b> <b>that</b> it was claimed they covered a distance in one day that equalled three days of normal travel. On the second day, after the Arabs crossed the river Wadi al-Subuh, the Turgesh army caught up with them, and attacked a secondary camp pitched by Abdallah ibn Abi Abdallah separately from the main Arab force. The Arabs and their Sogdian allies suffered heavy casualties—the brother of the ruler of Samarkand, Ghurak, being among the slain—but managed to repel the attack.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{regularly}} receives {{cold air}} from the <b>south</b> <b>that</b> can reach low latitudes owing {{to the influence of}} the Andes. Cold waves are usually accompanied with severe snowstorms or extremely cold conditions that can have a devastating impact on the country's economy. These snowstorms and/or extremely cold conditions can partially or completely paralyze activities in large areas of Patagonia and the center of the country. In addition, cold conditions can lead to energy shortages during the winter months due to increased demand. The low temperatures brought by these cold waves can cause frosts that can damage plants, severely affecting agricultural production and devastating the local economy.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie {{remained}} virtually stationary {{until the}} morning of September23 when it drifted very slowly to the west-southwest {{in response to the}} ridge. It also began to gradually weaken as the low-level center became exposed and the storm became poorly organized. Convection also diminished, and on the afternoon of September24, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters. Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September25 as it began to make a turn back around to the <b>south.</b> <b>That</b> evening, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E

5|$|During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802, {{the delegates}} {{allegedly}} received reports from a fur trapper that Lake Michigan extended significantly farther south than {{had previously been}} believed (or mapped). Thus, {{it was possible that}} an east–west line extending east from Lake Michigan's southern tip might intersect Lake Erie somewhere east of Maumee Bay, or worse, might not intersect the lake at all; the farther <b>south</b> <b>that</b> Lake Michigan actually extended, the more land Ohio would lose, perhaps even the entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{operations}} room at RAF Uxbridge was disturbed by {{a visit from}} Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Most of the plotting tables were bare, save for a few plots indicating German reconnaissance machines. Most of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) were relaxing, in spite of Churchill’s presence (he had ordered that they not behave any differently). However, at 10:30 the first German aircraft triggered the alarm at Chain Home radar station at Dover. The filter room at Stanmore recognised the formation as hostile. The WAAF detailed group and sector commands throughout the <b>south</b> <b>that</b> 40-plus enemy aircraft were entering Kentish airspace.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese {{offensive}} {{was slowly}} rolling over ARVN opposition {{north and south}} of Da Nang. General Dong's plan called for attacks on the area from the west, north, and <b>south</b> <b>that</b> would drive South Vietnamese forces into Da Nang, where they could be destroyed. The highway between Huế and Da Nang was cut at Phu Loc after severe fighting on 22 March. South of Da Nang, the 2nd ARVN Division barely managed to contain a North Vietnamese drive toward Tam Kỳ and the coastal plain. On the morning of 24 March, however, the 711th Division, backed by armored elements, seized Tam Kỳ, driving the population north toward Da Nang by the thousands. PAVN forces then cut Highway 1 between Quảng Ngãi and Chu Lai, a move to which the 2nd ARVN Division was too battered to respond. With Corps approval, South Vietnamese troops from Quảng Ngãi fought their way northward, but only a few managed to reach Chu Lai. In a single day the situation in I Corps had deteriorated beyond control.|$|E

On the evening of 7 October New Jersey received reports {{that a number of}} waterborne logistics craft were moving south near the mouth of the Song Giang River. New Jersey responded by closing on the formation, and succeeded in sinking eleven of the craft before they could beach.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 1, with only the {{shattered}} remnants of E Company at hand, the US 9th Infantry Regiment, US 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan. Division commander Major General Lawrence B. Keiser in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment. The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to Yongsan. The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around Yongsan on the northwest. Disorganized US forces were ordered to pull back to Yongsan. The road to Miryang came south out of Yongsan, bent around the western tip of this mountain, and then ran eastward along its southern base. In its position, they not only commanded the town but also its exit, the road to Miryang. North Koreans had also approached Yongsan from the <b>south.</b> <b>That</b> night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground around Yongsan and entered the town from the south.|$|E
5|$|Pall Mall was {{constructed}} in 1661, replacing an earlier highway slightly to the <b>south</b> <b>that</b> ran from the Haymarket (approximately where Warwick House Street is now) to the royal residence, St James's Palace. Historical research suggests a road had been in this location since Saxon times, although the earliest documentary references are from the 12th century {{in connection with a}} leper colony at St James's Hospital. When St. James's Park was laid out by order of Henry VIII in the 16th century, the park's boundary wall was built along {{the south side of the}} road. In 1620, the Privy Council ordered the High Sheriff of Middlesex to clear a number of temporary buildings next to the wall that were of poor quality.|$|E

5|$|The CLB {{directors}} concurred, and on January 19, 1920, {{they formed}} an organization {{under a new}} name, the American Civil Liberties Union. Although {{a handful of other}} organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons, or a single theme. Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts to overturn the disfranchisement of African Americans in the <b>South</b> <b>that</b> had taken place {{since the turn of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|The South financed a {{much lower}} {{proportion}} of its expenditures through direct taxes than the North. The share of direct taxes in total revenue for the North was about 20%, while for the South the same share was only about 8%. A {{major part of the}} reason why tax revenue did not play as large a role for the Confederacy was the individual states' opposition to a strong central government and the belief in states' rights which precluded giving too much taxing power to the government in Richmond. Another factor for not extending the tax system more broadly was the belief, present in both the North and the <b>South,</b> <b>that</b> the war would be of limited duration, and hence there was no compelling reason to increase the tax burden.|$|E
5|$|The Stella power {{stations}} were {{a pair of}} now-demolished coal-fired {{power stations}} in the North East of England that were a landmark in the Tyne valley for over 40years. The stations stood {{on either side of}} a bend of the River Tyne: Stella South power station, the larger, near Blaydon in Gateshead, and Stella North power station near Lemington in Newcastle. Their name originated from the nearby Stella Hall, a manor house close to Stella <b>South</b> <b>that</b> by the time of their construction had been demolished and replaced by a housing estate. They operated from shortly after the nationalisation of the British electrical supply industry until two years after the Electricity Act of 1989, when the industry passed into the private sector.|$|E

5|$|The ITCZ became {{active in}} late March, {{spawning}} several areas of convection across the Indian Ocean {{and into the}} adjacent Australian basin. The westernmost system had a circulation as of March31 about 600km (370mi) west-southwest of Diego Garcia. Despite favorable conditions, the system failed to organize at first, although it became Tropical Disturbance 9 on April2 after the structure improved. Drifting to the southwest and later to the south, the associated convection waxed and waned, finally organizing more on April4; on that day, the disturbance quickly intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Evariste. A day prior, the JTWC had initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 18S. A trough to the south weakened the ridge, turning the storm to the southwest. A small eye formed on April5, but later dissipated after an increase in thunderstorm activity. On that day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 110km/h (70mph), just shy of tropical cyclone status, while the JTWC estimated 1minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). On April6, increased wind shear from the approaching trough began weakening Evariste and turned it to the <b>south.</b> <b>That</b> day, it passed about 135km (85mph) east of St. Brandon, and on April7, Evariste bypassed Rodrigues about 200km (125mi) to the southwest. The convection gradually deteriorated and left the circulation exposed. Late on April7, the storm suddenly turned southwestward toward a developing low east of Madagascar, although the southwest motion resumed soon after. On April8, Evariste dissipated, dissipating ahead of the nearby trough.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{slavery was}} to be {{regulated}} under the new Constitution {{was a matter of}} such intense conflict between the North and <b>South</b> <b>that</b> several Southern states refused to join the Union if slavery were not to be allowed. Delegates opposed to slavery were forced to yield in their demands that slavery practiced {{within the confines of the}} new nation be completely outlawed. However, they continued to argue that the Constitution should prohibit the states from participating in the international slave trade, including in the importation of new slaves from Africa and the export of slaves to other countries. The Convention postponed making a final decision on the international slave trade until late in the deliberations because of the contentious nature of the issue. During the Convention's late July recess, the Committee of Detail had inserted language that would prohibit the federal government from attempting to ban international slave trading and from imposing taxes on the purchase or sale of slaves. The Convention could not agree on these provisions when the subject came up again in late August, so they referred the matter to an eleven-member committee for further discussion. This committee helped work out a compromise: Congress would have the power to ban the international slave trade, but not for another twenty years (that is, not until 1808). In exchange for this concession, the federal government's power to regulate foreign commerce would be strengthened by provisions that allowed for taxation of slave trades in the international market and that reduced the requirement for passage of navigation acts from two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress to simple majorities.|$|E
