5|$|Aspects of Raonic's game {{which have}} been criticized include his return of serve, quickness and mobility, backhand, <b>short</b> <b>game,</b> {{and the use of}} {{backspin}} or sidespin. His above-average height—196cm (6ft 5in)—is linked to his strong serve, but is said to limit his movement around the court.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game (also {{known as}} the Final Fantasy SGI demo, or Final Fantasy x, {{not related to the}} actual 10th game in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy X) was a <b>short</b> <b>game</b> demo {{produced}} by Square using characters and settings from Final Fantasy VI. Produced using new Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Onyx workstations acquired by Square, the demo was Square's first foray into 3D graphics, and many assumed that it was a precursor to a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 video game console, which also used SGI hardware. Square, however, had not yet committed to Nintendo's console {{at the time of the}} demo's production, and much of the technology demonstrated in the demo was later put to use in the rendering of FMV sequences for Final Fantasy VII and subsequent games for the PlayStation. The demo itself featured Terra Branford, Locke Cole, and Shadow in a series of battles. The game was controlled largely through mouse gestures: for example, moving the cursor in the shape of a star would summon a dragon to attack.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise <b>short</b> <b>game</b> about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E

25|$|From 1936, {{the rules}} booklet {{included}} with each Monopoly set contained a short section {{at the end}} providing rules for making the game shorter, including dealing out all the property cards before starting the game, or by setting a time limit, or by ending the game after the second player goes bankrupt. A later version of the rules included this variant, along with the time limit game, in the main rules booklet, omitting the second bankruptcy method as a third <b>short</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E

25|$|Seven Or More Players: Beyond six players, {{the game}} becomes either very complex, or hard to {{maintain}} with multiple decks. An additional side effect of an increased number of players is a <b>short</b> <b>game,</b> {{as the number of}} cards held by each player is reduced and high trump is more and more likely to take the trick. Seven players should normally be split into groups of four and three, eight players into two groups of four players, nine players into either groups of four and five players, or three groups of three players.|$|E
25|$|During the offseason, Nicklaus {{addressed}} {{two problems}} which had hurt his performance. His lifelong teacher Jack Grout {{noticed that he}} had become much too upright with his full swing, causing a steep, oblique approach into the ball, compared with a more direct hit; this was corrected by slightly flattening his backswing. Then Nicklaus' <b>short</b> <b>game,</b> never a career strength, was further developed {{with the help of}} Phil Rodgers, a friend for more than 20 years, and earlier PGA Tour rival, who had become a fine coach.

50|$|Rugby league nines (or simply nines) is {{a version}} of rugby league {{football}} played with nine players on each side.

It has become more popular than the similar rugby league sevens (rugby league with seven players to a side), with many tournaments using nines to distinguish it from rugby union sevens.|$|R
500|$|The {{game was}} {{sometimes}} {{compared to the}} Resident Evil series, though GamePro said that Parasite Eve had deeper gameplay with multiple weapon upgrades and hidden areas to discover. Reviewers also cited that though the game broke many RPG gaming conventions, it suffered from having little replay value and being a relatively <b>short</b> <b>game.</b> The combat was compared unfavorably to Final Fantasy VII by Game Revolution, which featured a dynamic camera instead of fixed one. The novel's original author Hideaki Sena approved of the game, stating that he was [...] "actually impressed how well the game makers translated the novel." ...|$|E
500|$|Crash of the Titans {{received}} mixed {{to average}} reviews upon its release. GameSpot credited it as a [...] "fairly sturdy, combat-heavy platformer {{with a good}} hook", but concluded that it lacked the distinctive style of past Crash Bandicoot games. The DS version of the game was reviewed positively, with IGN naming it [...] "one of the better handheld Crash games to hit the market". Nintendo World Report gave the DS version a higher score than the home console version by half a point, but dismissed it as [...] "a <b>short</b> <b>game</b> that has very little gameplay variety". GameSpot proclaimed that [...] "there's plenty to do, and controlling the enemy is a neat twist", but criticized the game's small length of only six to eight hours.|$|E
500|$|Ben Kuchera of Polygon {{wrote that}} the game was [...] "a {{brilliant}} little puzzler" [...] and commented on the difficulty of designing such an accessible minimalist game. Dan Ryckert of Game Informer noted that the game had all of the qualities of a successful mobile game: accessibility of <b>short</b> <b>game</b> sessions, easy to learn and tough to master gameplay, room to make and try strategies, and gameplay mechanics suited for touchscreens. He added that his progressive play strategy adaptations for higher scores made the game joyful. Ars Technica Kyle Orland wrote that he expects the game to join Drop7 and Super Hexagon on his phone {{for the rest of}} his life and Crypt of the Necrodancer designer Ryan Clark called Threes the best iOS game he had ever played.|$|E

[...] Heston and Sweeley were singled out for praise in the account of the game published in The Michigan Alumnus:"Two men, Sweeley and Heston, constantly won the plaudits of the rooters by their long gains around the ends. Sweeley is fleet, and he kept his feet in a way that reminded the wise ones of McLean's remarkable performances. Heston proved himself the ground gainer that he has given evidence of being during the daily practices." ...|$|E
500|$|Full {{production}} {{began on}} Chrono Cross in mid-1998. The Chrono Cross team reached 80 members at its peak, with additional personnel of 10–20 cut-scene artists and 100 quality assurance testers. The team felt pressure {{to live up}} to the work of Chrono Triggers [...] "Dream Team" [...] development group, which included famous Japanese manga artist Akira Toriyama. Kato and Tanaka hired Nobuteru Yūki for character design and Yasuyuki Honne for art direction and concept art. The event team originally envisioned a <b>short</b> <b>game,</b> and planned a system by which players would befriend any person in a town for alliance in battle. Developers brainstormed traits and archetypes during the character-creation process, originally planning 64 characters with unique endings that could vary in three different ways per character. Kato described the character creation process: [...] "Take Pierre, for example: we started off by saying we wanted a wacko fake hero like Tata from Trigger. We also said things like 'we need at least one powerful mom', 'no way we're gonna go without a twisted brat', and so on so forth." ...|$|E
500|$|The game {{is noted}} for its simple combat system that would [...] "disappoint those craving sheer {{mechanical}} depth", as stated by GameSpots Miguel Lopez. [...] The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for example, said that [...] "you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells you what to do, even though the game is always telling you what to do". [...] Ico is also considered a <b>short</b> <b>game,</b> taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which Game Revolution calls [...] "painfully short" [...] with [...] "no replay outside of self-imposed challenges". G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that [...] "the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' {{in one or two}} sittings". [...] The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. Electronic Gaming Monthly notes that [...] "Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not {{for the fact that the}} player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending." ...|$|E

500|$|Limbo {{initial release}} on the Xbox 360 has {{received}} acclaim from video game critics and journalists; the subsequent {{release of the}} game for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows platforms received similar praise, holding Metacritic aggregate scores of 90/100 and 88/100, respectively, compared to the 90/100 earned by the Xbox 360 version. Some journalists compared Limbo to previous minimalist platform games such as Another World, Flashback, Heart of Darkness, , Ico, Portal and Braid. Reviews consistently noted Limbo short length for its higher selling price: two to five hours of gameplay for 15 euros or 15 U.S. dollars. Reviewers asserted this length-to-price ratio was the largest drawback for the game, and would be a deterrent for potential buyers. Some journalists contended that {{the length of the}} game was ideal; The Daily Telegraph Tom Hoggins considered the <b>short</b> <b>game</b> to have a [...] "perfectly formed running time", while Daemon Hatfield of IGN commented that [...] "it's better for a game to leave us wanting more than to overstay its welcome". Numerous independent game developers, in an organised [...] "Size Doesn't Matter" [...] effort, commented on the critical response to Limbo length-to-price ratio. The independent developers questioned the need to quantify that ratio, and noted that it only seems {{to be used as a}} factor in judging video games and not other forms of entertainment such as films.|$|E
500|$|Peter Bartholow of GameSpot {{summarized}} Mischief Makers as [...] "a {{good game}} {{that will leave}} players wanting more". He liked the bosses, which made the player use all available skills, but felt they were short-lived and easily solved {{in the context of}} a <b>short</b> <b>game</b> with tutorials as one fifth of its levels. He did not consider the ending extension a suitable reward for returning to the levels, and predicted that most players would not finish the game more than once. Game Informer echoed Bartholow's comments about the game's brevity, and named the game's seven-event olympics as a highlight. Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote that the game felt incomplete and lamented that [...] "a decent player can finish the game in under three hours", though Next Generation said the game was [...] "certainly long enough". The game's frequent reuse of a small selection of tiles, objects, sound effects, soundtracks, and bland backgrounds (compared to the [...] "impressive" [...] boss battle animations and effects) led GameSpot Bartholow to suggest that Mischief Makers was limited by its cartridge space. He concluded that the [...] "decent" [...] game would be [...] "truly excellent ... on another medium". Zachary Miller of Nintendo World Report reported that the graphics did not age well into 2010. Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote that the game is [...] "definitely a sleeper hit". As Hardcore Gamer Ryan Cartmel put it, the game went [...] "largely unnoticed".|$|E
500|$|Allgame {{said the}} {{enjoyment}} [...] "isn't bad", but limited: [...] "You can only blow {{up so much}} stuff with a helicopter." [...] Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot in his PlayStation review called the game tired and mediocre, but reviewing the PC version, Shane Mooney wrote: [...] "I'm happy {{to say that the}} much-maligned action-heavy, plot-light genre has received a solid kick in the pants from the wonderfully fun Nuclear Strike." [...] Mooney praised the successful port from the console version and believed players would [...] "find plenty to slobber over in this extremely entertaining title." [...] Daily Radar said: [...] "When it comes to creating an action game, {{it would be nice to}} play something that requires a little bit more than just holding down the fire button continuously. In Nuclear Strike 64, that's just about all you do." [...] The website said: [...] "if all you're looking for is a game where you can fly around in a helicopter, drive a tank and manipulate 10 other vehicles in a destructive fest, well, here you go." [...] Allgame summarised: [...] "When all is said and done, Nuclear Strike 64 is a fine example of an excellent shooting game." [...] The reviewer believed that gamers would appreciate the game's longevity and variety. Game Revolution praised the helpful interface and responsive controls and said the mechanics were generally good, but complained of an occasionally inaccurate targeting system. The website acclaimed the [...] "perfect" [...] difficulty level. GameFan took issue with enemies shooting the player's vehicle while not visible on-screen. GameSpot's minor complaints were infrequent game saves, a [...] "too easy" [...] structure allowing supply lines to be destroyed before the main forces, a <b>short</b> <b>game</b> despite large missions and a lack of multiplayer.|$|E
