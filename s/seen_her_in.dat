5|$|Later at the Warsaw Tavern, Drew {{is hanging}} out with his friends when Mimi walks in and confronts him. Drew talks to her {{honestly}} about why she {{did not get the}} job, telling her that her attitude is the problem and she has to {{deal with the fact that}} her looks might stop her from getting some jobs. Mimi does not like Drew's advice and leaves the bar. Needing to fill the cosmetics position quickly, Drew believes he has found an ideal candidate in Natalie (Natasha Silver) until Kate turns up to apply for the job. Drew admits that he is worried that Kate will hate him if he has to fire her. However, Mr. Bell insists Drew hire Kate, having <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the lobby and Drew agrees. Kate later comes to Drew's house to ask him, Lewis and Oswald, which perfume samples to promote. The episode ends with Drew playing pool in his garden in the rain, while the others watch through the window.|$|E

He's fielding offers to sell the restaurant he runs in Buenos Aires, but changes his mind because it was started by his mother and father and has been in the family for years.|$|E
25|$|Her funeral, {{held at the}} Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, was {{attended}} by huge crowds. Julie Newmar read the eulogy. Darling's brother Warren, not having <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> years and unaware {{that she had been}} living as a woman, was said to have been visibly shaken by her feminine appearance. Darling's birth name was never spoken by the minister or any of the eulogizers. A piano piece was played by Faith Dane. Gloria Swanson saluted Darling's coffin.|$|E

Russell later {{appeared in}} Bedtime Stories. In an appearance on The View on December 15, 2008, Russell said she got the part because Adam Sandler's wife Jackie had <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> Waitress and suggested her for the movie. Russell voiced Wonder Woman in a direct-to-video animated feature released March 3, 2009.|$|E
25|$|By 1912 Isadora {{had become}} an icon for artists in Paris. Many had first <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> 1903 when {{she had gone to}} the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and {{distributed}} complimentary tickets to students. The artist Dunoyer de Segonzac published his first Isadora portfolio in 1910, with a preface in verse by the poet Fernand Divoire. At this time, Dunoyer de Segonzac and Metzinger were both teachers at the Académie de La Palette, 104 Bd de Clichy, Paris 18ème, along with Henri Le Fauconnier.|$|E
25|$|Dedman {{found that}} caretakers at her three residences had not <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> decades, {{and that her}} {{palatial}} estates in Santa Barbara and New Canaan, Connecticut, had lain empty throughout that time, although the houses and their extensive grounds were meticulously maintained by their staff. He determined in 2010 {{that she was in}} the care of a New York City hospital, and that some of her personal possessions had been quietly sold. Some of the possessions sold include a rare 1709 violin called La Pucelle (or The Virgin) made by Antonio Stradivari, and an 1882 Pierre-Auguste Renoir painting entitled In the Roses.|$|E

500|$|London {{producer}} Basil Dean {{bought the}} play A Circle of Chalk for Wong {{to appear in}} with the young Laurence Olivier, her first stage performance in the UK. Criticism of her California accent, described by one critic as a [...] "Yankee squeak", led to Wong seeking vocal tutoring at Cambridge University, where she trained in received pronunciation. Composer Constant Lambert, infatuated with the actress after having <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> films, attended the play on its opening night and subsequently composed Eight Poems of Li Po, dedicated to her.|$|E
500|$|On 6May more {{witnesses}} for {{the prosecution}} were called. [...] As Squires and her family watched, several of Wells's neighbours insisted they had, about the beginning of 1753, seen the old gypsy in the area. [...] More witnesses claimed to have <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> various places around Enfield Wash, including one woman who swore she had seen her on Old Christmas Day. [...] Britain's calendar had in September 1752 changed from the old-style Julian calendar, to the Gregorian calendar, and the woman was unable to discern the exact day on which she claimed to have seen Squires. [...] She was not alone; several of the defence's witnesses were also unable to manage the 11-day correction required by the calendar change. [...] Others were illiterate, and struggled similarly. [...] The court also heard from three witnesses present solely to discredit the testimony offered by the Natuses.|$|E
500|$|Piller was {{disappointed}} with the following Ro episode, [...] "", as it {{put her in the}} position of disbelieving Counselor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of [...] "victories" [...] in the past to convince the viewer of the power of her convictions. But he enjoyed her sudden relationship with Commander William Riker in [...] "". Forbes shared the view of that episode, later saying [...] "When you have amnesia, you wonder if that brings out a side of you that's always wanted to come out. Would you really be comfortable with that? It's an interesting thing. I had a really good time with that episode." [...] Later in the season, [...] "The Next Phase" [...] was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi, but it was decided to include Ro instead as one of the lead characters. Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel's original pitch for the episode [...] "". This would have <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> a love triangle with Picard and Riker. Instead, the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard.|$|E

500|$|Smith's longest-running role is voicing Lisa Simpson on The Simpsons. She has voiced Lisa since 1987, {{beginning}} with The Simpsons shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. Smith had initially {{been asked to}} audition {{for the role of}} Lisa's brother Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila thought her voice was too high. Smith later recalled [...] "I always sounded too much like a girl, I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'" [...] Smith was given the role of Lisa, instead. She denies rumors that she almost turned down the role, though admits she had never planned a career in voice-over work. Pietila stated that, having <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> Living on Salvation Street, Smith was always her preferred choice. Smith lifts her voice up slightly to perform the role. Lisa is the only regular character voiced by Smith, although in some earlier episodes, she provided some of Maggie's squeaks and occasional speaking parts. Smith has only voiced characters other than Lisa on very rare occasions, with those characters usually being some derivative of Lisa, such as Lisa Bella in [...] "Last Tap Dance in Springfield" [...] and Lisa, Jr. in [...] "" [...] (both from season 11 in 2000). Smith spends two days a week recording the show.|$|E
2500|$|Fontanne and Lunt worked {{together}} in 27 productions. Of her acting style with Lunt, British broadcasting personality Arthur Marshall - having <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> Caprice St James's Theatre (1929) - observed: [...] "In the plays of the period, actors waited to speak until somebody else had finished; the Lunts turned all that upside down. They threw away lines, they trod on each others words, they gabbled, they {{spoke at the}} same time. They spoke, in fact, as people do in ordinary life." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Ellis, {{releasing}} a letter Monday evening {{that he sent}} Saturday to county Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Graf, denies violating the agreement. The letter, in part, states: [...] "As for Ms. Bradley and myself, that case was amicably closed April 1 and never violated by either party. As I told Ms. Jackson, I did mistakenly dial Ms. Bradley on her cell when trying to call someone with a very close number and I dialed too quickly...after four years, {{it was an old}} habit. Nothing was said and I immediately hung up when I realized my mistake. That happened one time in a month. I have said nothing to Ms. Bradley nor <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> or out of the county workplace." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the cast}} {{was made up of}} actors with whom Weitz had {{previously}} worked. He directed Marcia Gay Harden in American Dreamz and decided to cast her as Elle's daughter, since she was the only actress he suggested for the role whom Tomlin [...] "seemed mildly intimidated by". He cast Nat Wolff and John Cho after working with them on Admission and American Pie, respectively; he had also worked with Judy Greer twice before. He contacted Sam Elliott through his brother, Chris Weitz, who had directed Elliott in The Golden Compass. Weitz offered the role of Sage to Julia Garner after seeing her performance in Electrick Children. He wrote Laverne Cox's character for her because he had <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> Orange Is the New Black, and they refined the details of the character together.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan, one of {{the last}} actors to be cast, was invited because Iñárritu had <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the play Detroit. Lindsay Duncan had vast {{experience}} in the theatre world too, and decided to accept the offer to play the critic because {{of the quality of the}} script. [...] "It's delicious because of the writing." [...] But like Shiner's character, Iñárritu found casting Laura difficult. Riseborough met him on a street corner for a cup of tea, and recalling the event, said [...] "I told him that I would crawl across hot coals to work with him". Iñárritu described Laura as [...] "a very wacky, quirky role", but said [...] "when [...] did it I knew that it was her, because she did it right in the tone, and she understood who she was – she was not judging".|$|E
