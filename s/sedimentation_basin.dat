25|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} {{are designed}} to remove stormwater pollutants associated with fine to colloidal particles and dissolved contaminants. These shallow, extensively vegetated water bodies use enhanced sedimentation, fine filtration and biological uptake to remove these pollutants. They usually comprise three zones: an inlet zone (<b>sedimentation</b> <b>basin)</b> to remove coarse sediments; a macrophyte zone, a heavily vegetated area to remove fine particulates and uptake of soluble pollutants; and a high flow bypass channel to protect the macrophyte zone. The macrophyte zone generally includes a marsh zone {{as well as an}} open water zone and has an extended depth of 0.25 to 0.5m with specialist plant species and a retention time of 48 to 72 hours. Constructed Wetlands can also provide a flow control function by rising during rainfall and then slowly releasing the stored flows. Constructed wetlands will improve the runoff water quality depending on the wetland processes. The key treatment mechanism of wetlands are physical (trapping suspended solids and adsorbed pollutants), biological and chemical uptake (trapping dissolved pollutants, chemical adsorption of pollutants), and pollutant transformation (more stable sediment fixation, microbial processes, UV disinfection).|$|E

Enteroviruses were detected and determined using two techniques, cell culture as infectivity assay and real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (real time RT-PCR) as a molecular biological technology. The results revealed that the {{wastewater treatment}} facility in El-Manzala showed good performance under Egyptian climatic conditions. The aquatic macrophytes system (biological treatment) showed better performance compared to the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>basins</b> (physical treatment) in removing viral loads. Enteroviruses load at the wetland inlet ranged between 50 and 100 % as viral infectivity (VI) by cell culture, and between 4. 9 × 104 and 59. 5 × 105 gene copies (GC) by real time RT-PCR. The virus load after <b>sedimentation</b> <b>basins</b> ranged between 25 and 50 % as VI and between 3. 7 × 102 and 4. 5 × 104 GC, while after the biological treatment recorded 0 % as VI and between 0 and 2 GC. An empirical model was developed to describe the relationship between the quantity of enteroviruses using molecular biology and infective assay as a predictor variable. The present study concluded that the wastewater treatment wetland in El-Manzala can be considered as an effective facility in reducing viral contamination of the Bahr El-Baqar drainage water...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this PhD research {{is to develop a}} set of stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) with respect to design, operation and maintenance of <b>sedimentation</b> <b>basins</b> (SBs). Stormwater BMPs may be defined as any program, technology, process, citing criteria, operating method, or device, which controls, prevents, or reduces pollution from stormwater runoff. <b>Sedimentation</b> <b>Basins</b> at construction sites are currently designed for runoff capture rather than for particle removal. Well designed SBs that capture particles effectively are essential for capturing sediments and particulate contaminants (iron, aluminum, manganese and phosphate). An integrated methodology for designing basins incorporating runoff capture, required level of particle removal and effective sediment containment is not available. Through this research an integrated method for designing SBs by applying, rainfall probability plots to determine basin settling volume, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to identify sediment zone volume and overflow rate to identify particle removal in the basin was developed. Further a set of design curves were generated to understand the change in basin performance and cost with change in basin design parameters. In addition the capacity of <b>sedimentation</b> <b>basins</b> to neutralize naturally occurring mildly acidic seeps (pH 5 - 6) was identified.

The suggested integrated design method and the best management practices  address runoff capture, particle removal, pollutant peak attenuation, acidic seep drainage, algae growth and mosquito breeding in the basins.
