40|$|Fast and {{reliable}} pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) {{is required for}} simulation and other applications in scientific computing. In this work, a polynomial PRNG algorithm, based on a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is presented. LFSR generator of order k determines a 2 k − 1 cyclic sequence period when the associated polynomial is primitive. The main drawback of this generator is the cyclicality of the <b>shifted</b> <b>binary</b> sequence. A non-linear transformation is proposed, which eliminates the underlying cyclicality and maintains both {{the characteristics of the}} original generator and the feedback function. The modified generator assures a good trade off between fastness and reliability and passes both graphical and statistical tests...|$|E

Each m-ary linear feedback <b>shift</b> register with <b>binary</b> logic generates a binary {{representation of a}} nonbinary recurring sequence, producible with a m-ary linear feedback <b>shift</b> register without <b>binary</b> logic in which m is greater than 2. The state table of a m-ary linear feedback <b>shift</b> register without <b>binary</b> logic, utilizing sum modulo m feedback, is first tubulated for a given initial state. The entries in the state table are coded in binary and the binary entries are used to set the initial states of the stages of a plurality of <b>binary</b> <b>shift</b> registers. A single feedback logic unit is employed which provides a separate feedback binary digit to each binary register {{as a function of}} the states of corresponding stages of the binary registers...|$|R

Replacing an analog delay line by a <b>binary</b> <b>shift</b> register reduces the cost of silicon area and power, and improves the immunity of the delay line to interferences. The high-frequency quantization noise introduced by the modulator is removed naturally by the FIR filter to be implemented, so that the analog output is reconstructed accurately at the filter output without requiring additional hardware. Experimental results are presented. Finite impulse response (FIR) filters are very useful in many applications, especially those where filtering with linear phase is required.

40|$|Local Binary Pattern (LBP) {{has been}} widely used for {{analyzing}} local texture features of an image. Several new extensions of LBP based texture descriptors have been proposed, focusing on improving the robustness to noise by using different encoding or thresholding schemes where the most widely known are Median Binary Patterns (MBP), Fuzzy LBP (FLBP), Local Quantized Patterns (LQP), and Shift LBP (SLBP). LBP based descriptors are rarely applied in Finger-Knuckle-Print (FKP) recognition and especially, SLBP-based descriptors has not been reported yet. In this paper we propose using the Multi-scale <b>Shift</b> <b>Binary</b> Pattern (MSLBP) descriptor which extends the original SLBP to multi-scale to get more robust and discriminative representation of FKP features. The classification of this new proposed feature is performed by using Principle Component Analysis and Random subspace Linear Discriminant Analysis and {{the results suggest that}} they outperform other classifiers in FKP recognition. Experiments are performed using the PolyU FKP database and the results obtained have shown that the proposed FKP recognition method achieves outstanding rank- 1 recognition rate up to 95 % compared to the state-of-the-art FKP approaches...|$|R

50|$|For example, in an Intel 8086, {{as well as}} {{in later}} {{processors}} running 16-bit code, a far pointer has two parts: a 16-bit segment value and a 16-bit offset value. A linear address is obtained by <b>shifting</b> the <b>binary</b> segment value four times to the left, and then adding the offset value. Hence the effective address is 20 bits (actually 21-bit, which led to the address wraparound and the Gate A20). There can be up to 4096 different segment-offset address pairs pointing to one physical address. To compare two far pointers, they must first be converted (normalized) to their 20-bit linear representation.|$|R
