5000|$|The surface {{expression}} of the geothermal system consists of a [...] "215 ft, 1 mi opaline <b>sinter</b> <b>terrace</b> produced by hot spring and natural geyser (sic fumarole) activity along {{the base of the}} Malpais Rim. Since 1959, several companies have tested the potential of the area as a source of steam for electrical power generation. The spectacular hot water and steam plume that at present (1985/1986) vents continuously {{along the top of the}} <b>sinter</b> <b>terrace</b> is not a natural geyser, but is a free-flowing, uncapped geothermal well." [...] (Struhsacker, 1986 pg 111).|$|E
5000|$|Some tens {{of miles}} north of Lijiang is the Baishui Terrace (白水台 Baishuitai, {{literally}} [...] "White Water Terrace"), an area where spring water flows over a <b>sinter</b> <b>terrace,</b> leaving behind travertine. Lijiang is also close to the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain (玉龙雪山).|$|E
50|$|Atop this terrace is the Artist’s Palette, a 10,000 m² silica <b>sinter</b> <b>terrace</b> {{covered with}} clear blue alkali {{chloride}} pools and irregularly erupting geysers. To {{one side of}} this topmost terrace a new geyser began to erupt in 2001, possibly {{the beginnings of a}} further terrace.|$|E
5000|$|Orakei Korako (Māori for [...] "The Place of Adorning"), is {{a highly}} active {{geothermal}} area most notable for its series of fault-stepped <b>sinter</b> <b>terraces,</b> located in a valley north of Taupo {{on the banks of}} the Waikato River in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. It is also known as “The Hidden Valley”.|$|R
50|$|At {{numerous}} points, calcite pisoliths {{are found}} at Pastos Grandes, {{usually associated with}} active or former springs. Rimstone dams and <b>sinter</b> <b>terraces</b> are also encountered close to inactive springs. All these cave formations encountered at Pastos Grandes are caused by the precipitation of calcite from oversaturated waters at the surface. What drives the loss {{of carbon dioxide and}} thus the oversaturation is not clear but may involve photosynthesis by algae.|$|R
5000|$|Colourful <b>sinter</b> <b>terraces</b> {{are visible}} on the western shore of Frying Pan Lake, and {{immediately}} east of Echo Crater {{was the site of}} the extinct Waimangu Geyser. The crater area continued to be the source of eruptions in 1915, 1917, and last in 1973, and is still highly active, as evident by the steaming Cathedral Rocks to the north, and a cluster of hot springs and silica formations northeast of the lake referred to as [...] "Hot Springs of Mother Earth (Nga Puia o te Papa)".|$|R
40|$|Champagne Pool, Waiotapu, New Zealand {{discharges}} reduced geothermal fluids rich in CO 2, H 2 S trace elements, and over-saturated {{with respect}} to several sulfide minerals including orpiment, stibnite and carlinite. After discharge from Champagne Pool, the geothermal fluid cools, degasses and flows over a silica-sintered terrace that hosts a diverse microbial community. Geothermal fluid from Champagne Pool was sampled every 2 h for a 24 -h period at five sites between the spring and above the first major downstream dilution. Systematic diurnal variations in composition occur at the three most downstream sample sites whereas {{the composition of the}} two upstream sites remains comparatively constant. At the three downstream sites, daytime increase in the concentration of dissolved As, Sb and Tl coincides with peak photosynthetic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Field observations, analyses and modelling with PHREEQC indicate that sulphur, and amorphous equivalents of orpiment, stibnite and carlinite precipitate at night within Champagne Pool and on some of the <b>sinter</b> <b>terrace</b> area. However, on the <b>sinter</b> <b>terrace,</b> daytime increases in DO concentrations from photosynthetic bacteria are sufficient to destabilise the sulfide minerals and sulfur that precipitate at night, enabling oxidation of the amorphous precipitates during the day. Oxidation of As, Sb and Tl sulfides and sulfur is probably biologically catalysed and causes a pronounced daytime decrease, 3 ̆e 2 pH, at the two most downstream sites. Diurnal increases in the concentrations of Be, Ba and Sr at the two furthest downstream sites are likely {{to be related to the}} pH decrease caused by upstream oxidation. The geochemical mechanism responsible for daytime concentration increases in Be, Ba and Sr is unclear. Two processes that could be disrupted by daytime pH decrease are precipitation of silicate, sulfate or carbonate minerals on the <b>sinter</b> <b>terrace</b> or adsorption of trace elements onto clay minerals, viable/non-viable organic material or amorphous sulfide precipitates. These findings have implications for sampling programmes within geothermal areas and other environments such as estuaries and wetlands, where reduced mineral species could interact with photosynthetic biological processes...|$|E
30|$|Under {{the applied}} stress field, the north–northwest-striking Neal and Sugarloaf Butte faults {{on the eastern}} and western margins of the step-over, respectively, are {{generally}} well-oriented for slip and dilation. At the southern margin of the step-over, the Neal fault bends[*]~[*] 10 ° westward and thereby has relatively higher slip and dilation tendency to the north than to the south, indicating a higher potential for fracture permeability and fluid flow. Two northwest-striking faults, which have the highest slip and dilation tendency of faults within the step-over, intersect with the Neal fault in this area as well. This collocation of the high intersection density within the step-over, {{as well as the}} intersection between optimally oriented smaller faults and an optimally oriented section of the Neal fault, results in the highest geothermal favorability within the Neal Hot Springs 3 D geothermal potential map. As a result of the highest density of well data and 2 D seismic reflection data through this area, the geologic geometries here are relatively well constrained (Fig.  8 b). The four production wells intersect the Neal fault within the middle Miocene mafic Columbia River Group volcanic section in this area, and the Quaternary silica sinter lies directly up-dip along the Neal fault from this high potential zone, suggesting that this area transmits geothermal fluids to the production wells, surficial hot springs, and <b>sinter</b> <b>terrace</b> (Fig.  15).|$|E
40|$|The Springfontein Prospect is a Tertiary aged epithermal Hot Spring deposit {{that was}} {{investigated}} for precious metal mineralisation. It is located some 14 kilometres due west of East London (Cape Province), within Beaufort Group sediments and Karoo dolerite. Prior {{to the work}} described in this case study, the location was known for it's abundant plant fossils and barite mineralisation. A gossan sample collected near the main barite vein returned 1, 07 g/t Au and 26, 6 g/t Ag. Remote sensing studies of the site revealed a set of north-south lineaments paralleling the barite vein system. Geophysical surveys confirmed this orientation and revealed an extensive alteration system underlying the prominent <b>sinter</b> <b>terrace.</b> A detailed soil geochemical survey returned elevated values in the classical epithermal gold mineralisation element suite (Rg, Tl, As, Bi, Sb, Te, Mo, Ba and Pb - Bonham, 1986). Trenching of geochemical anomalies revealed zones of intense argillic alteration and vein stockworks). Four percussion and three diamond drill holes intersected a 'feeder-fissure' system of veins, alteration and brecciation, but failed to repeat gold levels seen at surface. Mineralogical and petrographic studies of the cores determined temperatures of formation of important indicator minerals (e. g. adularia and zeolites). Litho-geochemical work revealed mercury (and thallium) to be most elevated in the feeder systems. Stratigraphic and paleontological observations determined that the Springfontein Tertiary deposit was clearly different to the other siliceous (silcrete) units that crop out in the Eastern Cape region. A number of distinguished visitors to the prospect, with epithermal deposit experience, confirmed that the characteristics and dimensions {{of the system is}} within those of mineralised deposits elsewhere. A brief review of current epithermal models are presented. The conceptual geological model for the Springfontein prospect evolved through the exploration programme. The final consensus is that it best fits Bonham's (1986) alkalic model and the Tertiary epithermal event was sustained by rifting associated with the break-up of Gondwanaland...|$|E
2500|$|Further {{north is}} the Lower Geyser Basin , {{which has a}} much less {{concentrated}} set of geothermal features, including Fountain Paint Pots. Fountain Paint Pots are mud pots, that is, a hot spring that contains boiling mud instead of water. The mud is produced by a higher acidity in the water which enables the spring to dissolve surrounding minerals to create an opaque, usually grey, mud. Also found in this basin is Great Fountain Geyser, whose eruptions reach [...] in the air, while waves of water cascade down its <b>sinter</b> <b>terraces.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most recent}} {{eruption}} in Echo Crater occurred on 22 February 1973, destroying the Trinity Terrace {{area on the}} south-eastern shore of Frying Pan Lake. An area of colourful <b>sinter</b> <b>terraces</b> is still visible on the western shore of the lake. To the north, the lake is bounded by the steaming Cathedral Rocks. This monolithic rock structure is composed of rhyolitic lava at least 60,000 years old and was named Gibraltar Rock until the 1917 Echo Crater eruption completely changed its shape. A fumarole known as the Devil's Blowhole in the northern wall of Echo Crater also disappeared in that event.|$|R
30|$|Within the {{accommodation}} zone, {{a series}} of boiling springs and fossil <b>sinter</b> <b>terraces</b> lie along the trace of a northerly striking, west-dipping normal fault. Evidence of geothermal outflow extends 2  km along the fault trace, but active springs are concentrated at the northern termination of the fault. The geothermal upwelling appears to be focused within a dense network of small, overlapping normal faults, restricted to a corridor less than 500  m wide along the axial part of the anticline, where the dominant polarity of the faults shifts {{from east to west}} dipping (Fig.  7 a). A single north–northeast-striking, west-dipping normal fault within this narrow zone supplies the production wells associated with a 24 MWe capacity power plant constructed in 2012 (Dering 2013; Dering and Faulds 2013 b). The geothermal fluids are extracted from limestones and claystones that dominate the Paleozoic basement stratigraphy of the region. The relatively high density of data from wells in the narrow axial part of the accommodation zone suggests relatively high confidence in the 3 D geologic relationships in this area relative to the periphery of the 3 D map where subsurface data are sparser (Fig.  7 b).|$|R
40|$|The Ngatamariki Geothermal Field {{is located}} 20 km north of Taupo in the Taupo Volcanic Zone {{and has a}} {{boundary}} of 12 km² as delineated by magneto-telluric surveys (Urzua 2008). Rhyolitic deposits, derived from the Maroa Volcanic Centre, dominate the geology of the area with the 186 AD (Wilson et al. 2009) Taupo pumice mantling stream valleys in the area. The majority of thermal features at Ngatamariki are located along the Orakonui Stream on the western boundary of the field; the stream area is dominated by a 50 x 30 m geothermal pool filling a hydrothermal eruption crater. This crater was formed during a hydrothermal eruption in 1948, with a subsequent eruption in April 2005. Orakei Korako is located 7 km north of Ngatamariki and {{has one of the}} largest collections of thermal features in New Zealand. The geology at Orakei Korako is similar to Ngatamariki, but the area is dominated by a series of south-west trending normal faults which create <b>sinter</b> <b>terraces</b> on the eastern bank of Lake Ohakuri. Water samples from springs and wells at Ngatamariki and Orakei Korako were taken to assess the nature of both fields. Spring waters at Ngatamariki have chloride contents of 56 to 647 mg/l with deep waters from wells ranging from 1183 to 1574 mg/l. This variation is caused by mixing of deep waters with a steam heated groundwater, above clay caps within the reservoir. Stable isotopic results (δ¹⁸O and δD) suggest that reservoir waters are meteoric waters mixed with magmatic (andesitic) water at Ngatamariki. Reservoir water chemistry at Orakei Korako exhibits low chloride contents, which is anomalous in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Chloride content in well and spring waters is similar ranging from 546 to 147 mg/l, due to mixing of reservoir fluids with a ‘hot water’ diluent at depth. Isotopic compositions of spring waters suggest that they are meteoric waters which mix with magmatic (rhyolitic) water, more enriched in δ¹⁸O and δD than ‘andesitic’ water. Relationships between major ion concentrations and known subsurface geology suggest there is no hydraulic connection between the two fields...|$|R
