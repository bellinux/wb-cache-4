40|$|Low Glycemic Index (GI) food {{products}} could become good choices for diabetic patients or {{people at risk}} of developing diabetes type 2. Arrowroot tuber (Maranta arundinacea) is a local tuber that has lower GI (8 - 32). Glycemic Index strongly related with <b>starch</b> digestibility. Amylose and resistant <b>starch</b> are two factors that influence <b>starch</b> digestion. Higher amylose and resistant <b>starch,</b> related with crystalline form of <b>starch,</b> can lower <b>starch</b> digestion. Processing arrowroot into instant <b>starch</b> or flour with low starchy digestion can be a proper choice. Drying using high temperature {{is known to be}} able to increase amylose, resistant <b>starch</b> and reduce the <b>starch</b> digestibility.

The impact on the yields of resistant <b>starch</b> (RS), microstructure, physicochemical and functional properties was investigated. Compared to native <b>starch,</b> the RS content of heat-moisture treated <b>starches</b> increased significantly. The RS level of HMT- 20 was the highest of all the <b>starches.</b> Birefringence was displayed clear {{at the center of}} native <b>starch.</b> For HMT <b>starches,</b> pronounced birefringence was exhibited on the periphery of <b>starch</b> granules; however, birefringence disappeared at the centre of some <b>starch</b> granules. The shape of HMT <b>starches</b> hadn’t been changed and the integrity of <b>starch</b> granules was preserved for all the conditions. Concavity could be observed on HMT <b>starches</b> under scanning electronic microscopy. After HMT, apparent amylose contents were increased and <b>starch</b> macromolecule was degraded in comparison with those of native <b>starch.</b> There was a reduction in swelling power on HMT <b>starches,</b> but the solubility of HMT <b>starches</b> was higher than that of native <b>starch.</b> Both of native and HMT <b>starches</b> showed A-type X-ray diffraction pattern.
