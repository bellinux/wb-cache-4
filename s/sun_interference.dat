The KOMPSAT orbit was propagated including only J 2 geopotential term for maintaining the Sun-synchronism and no other perturbations were included. Local time of ascending node of the KOMPSAT satellite was set to 10 h 50 m 00 s. The TT&C station was assumed to locate in Taejon and have 9 meter antenna for S-band link. One year of simulation from 1999 / 07 / 01 were performed out of 3 year of mission lifetime of KOMPSAT satellite. Total four times of <b>Sun</b> <b>interference</b> events were occurred during 1 year of simulation and those lasted about 50 seconds altogether. The C/N degradation of the TT&C system was calculated about 4 dB.

We performed measurement and simulation signal from co-located satellites THAICOM 2 and 3 were located at 78. 5 degrees east. The downlink station was at Maung, Khonkaen, longitude 102. 83 degrees east and latitude 16. 43 degrees north. The 4. 6 m and 4. 5 m diameter antennas {{were set up}} to record both frequency bands. There were total 7 times of <b>sun</b> noise <b>interference</b> for C band and 3 times for Ku-band during spring 2003. The maximum of C/N degradation were 18 dB and 7 dB for C and Ku-bands respectively. The measured threshold level of C-band analog is 22 dB and that of Ku-band digital is 8 dB. The experiment shows that Ku-band signal can avoid <b>sun</b> noise <b>interference</b> because both picture and sound were not disrupted by sun noise. Because the rise in sun noise temperature doesn’t significantly interfere with signals, it can be overcome by a modest amount of system margin equivalent to that normally provide against rain fade...|$|R

The satellite was launched in June 1978 and was operated successfully until October 1978. A massive electrical failure occurred in the power system, terminating the mission prematurely. The actual implementation of the Seasat Attitude Determination system and the contents of the attitude data files generated by that system are documented. The deviations from plan caused by the anomalous <b>Sun</b> <b>interference</b> with horizon sensors, inflight calibration of Sun sensor head 2 alignment and horizon sensor biomass, estimation of yaw interpolation parameters, Sun and horizon sensor error sources, and yaw interpolation accuracy are included.

40|$|The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) {{spacecraft}} is a nadir pointing spacecraft that nominally {{controls the}} roll and pitch attitude {{based on the}} Earth Sensor Assembly (ESA) output. TRMM's nominal orbit altitude was 350 km, until raised to 402 km to prolong mission life. During the boost, the ESA experienced a decreasing signal to noise ratio, until <b>sun</b> <b>interference</b> at 393 km altitude made the ESA data unreliable for attitude determination. At that point, the backup attitude determination algorithm, an extended Kalman filter, was enabled. After the boost finished, TRMM reacquired its nadir-pointing attitude, and continued its mission.

In addition, flight results from analyzing attitude data and the results of software changes made onboard TRMM will be discussed. Some lessons learned are presented...|$|E

The salient features in the data are described and demonstrated by data plots. High frequency noise must be filtered out to achieve good accuracy, but this is effectively done by 128 -point averaging. <b>Sun</b> and moon <b>interference</b> effects are identified. The effects of earth oblateness and spacecraft altitude variations are modeled, and the residual systematic errors are analyzed. Most of the residual errors are apparently explained by the effects of earth radiance variation, with the winter polar regions showing the highest variability in the attitude measurements due to winter stratosphere temperature variations. In general, this sensor provides improved accuracy over those flown on previous missions...|$|R
40|$|Weather radar data is {{susceptible}} to several artifacts due to anamalous propagation, ground clutter, electronic <b>interference,</b> <b>sun</b> angle, second-trip echoes and biological contaminants such as insects, bats and birds. Several methods of censoring radar reflectivity data have been devised and described in the literature. However, they all rely on analyzing the local texture and vertical profile of reflectivity fields. The local texture of reflectivity fields suffices to remove most artifacts, except for biological echoes. Biological echoes have proved difficult to remove because they can have the same returned power and vertical profile as stratiform rain or snow. In this paper, we describe a soft-computing technique based on clustering, segmentation and a two-stage neural network to censor all non-precipitating artifacts in weather radar reflectivity data. We demonstrate that the technique is capable of discrimination between light snow, stratiform rain and deep biological ”bloom”. 1...|$|R

RF attitude sensing provide attitude measurements compatible {{with the requirements of}} future body and spin stabilized satellites employing narrow antenna beams without recourse to mechanical motion. Sensor alignment errors are greatly reduced since the sensing element is a physical part of the antenna array. Troublesome operational difficulties of <b>sun</b> and moon <b>interference</b> are also eliminated. Yaw angle is determined through measurement of roll and pitch angle to two separated beacons.

It also computes GCI vectors from the spacecraft to the position on the Earth's limb where each cluster detects the Earth's limb. These body frame vectors are used as sensor observation vectors and the GCI vectors are used as reference vectors in an attitude solution. The attitude, with the unobservable yaw discarded, is iteratively refined to provide the Earth observation vector solution...|$|R

Exploring telomere dynamics in living human cells by advanced time-lapse confocal microscopy allowed us to evaluate the spatial distribution of telomeres within the nuclear volume. We discovered an unambiguous enrichment of telomeres at the nuclear periphery during postmitotic nuclear assembly, whereas telomeres were localized more internally {{during the rest of}} the cell cycle. Telomere enrichment at the nuclear rim was mediated by physical tethering of telomeres to the nuclear envelope, most likely via specific interactions between the shelterin subunit RAP 1 and the nuclear envelope protein <b>Sun</b> 1. Genetic <b>interference</b> revealed a critical role in cell-cycle progression for Sun 1 but no effect on telomere positioning for RAP 1. Our results shed light on the dynamic relocalization of human telomeres during the cell cycle and suggest redundant pathways for tethering telomeres to the nuclear envelope...|$|R
40|$|Representative data spans {{covering}} {{a little more}} than a year since the LANDSAT- 4 launch were analyzed to evaluate the flight performance of the satellite's horizon scanner. High frequency noise was filtered out by 128 -point averaging. The effects of Earth oblateness and spacecraft altitude variations are modeled, and residual systematic errors are analyzed. A model for the predicted radiance effects is compared with the flight data and deficiencies in the radiance effects modeling are noted. Correction coefficients are provided for a finite Fourier series representation of the systematic errors in the data. Analysis of the seasonal dependence of the coefficients indicates the effects of some early mission problems with the reference attitudes which were computed by the onboard computer using star trackers and gyro data. The effects of <b>sun</b> and moon <b>interference,</b> unexplained anomalies in the data, and sensor noise characteristics and their power spectrum are described. The variability of full orbit data averages is shown. Plots of the sensor data for all the available data spans are included...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{techniques}} of quality control of radar reflectivity data rely on local texture and vertical profiles {{to discriminate between}} precipitating echoes and non-precipitating echoes. Non-precipitating echoes {{may be due to}} artifacts such as anamalous propagation, ground clutter, electronic <b>interference,</b> <b>sun</b> strobe, and biological contaminants (i. e., birds, bats and insects). The local texture of reflectivity fields suffices to remove most artifacts, except for biological echoes. Biological echoes, also called ”bloom ” echoes because of their circular shape and expanding size during the night time, have proven difficult to remove, especially in peak migration seasons of various biological species, because they can have local and vertical characteristics similar to that of stratiform rain or snow. In this paper, we describe a technique that identifies candidate bloom echoes based on the range-variance of reflectivity in areas of bloom, and uses the global, rather than local, characteristic of the echo to discriminate between bloom and rain. Every range gate is assigned a probability that it corresponds to bloom using morphological (shape-based) operations and a neural network is trained using this probability as one of the input features. We demonstrate that this technique is capable of identifying and removing echoes due to biological targets and other types of artifacts while retaining echoes that correspond to precipitation...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of tropospheric CO 2 {{abundance}} with global-coverage, a {{few hundred}} km spatial and monthly temporal resolution are needed to quantify processes that regulate CO 2 storage by the land and oceans. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) is the first space mission focused on atmospheric CO 2 for measuring total column CO, and O 2 by detecting the spectral absorption in reflected sunlight. The OCO mission is an essential step, and will yield important new information about atmospheric CO 2 distributions. However there are unavoidable limitations imposed by its measurement approach. These include best accuracy only during daytime at moderate to high <b>sun</b> angles, <b>interference</b> by cloud and aerosol scattering, and limited signal from CO 2 variability in the lower tropospheric CO 2 column. We have been developing a new laser-based technique for the remote measurement of the tropospheric CO 2 concentrations from orbit. Our initial goal is to demonstrate a lidar technique and instrument technology that will permit measurements of the CO 2 column abundance in the lower troposphere from aircraft. Our final goal {{is to develop a}} space instrument and mission approach for active measurements of the CO 2 mixing ratio at the 1 - 2 ppmv level. Our technique is much less sensitive to cloud and atmospheric scattering conditions and would allow continuous measurements of CO 2 mixing ratio in the lower troposphere from orbit over land and ocean surfaces during day and night. Our approach is to use the 1570 nm CO 2 band and a 3 -channel laser absorption spectrometer (i. e. lidar used an altimeter mode), which continuously measures at nadir from a near polar circular orbit. The approach directs the narrow co-aligned laser beams from the instrument's lasers toward nadir, and measures the energy of the laser echoes reflected from land and water surfaces. It uses several tunable fiber laser transmitters which allowing measurement of the extinction from a single selected CO 2 absorption line in the 1570 nm band. This band is free from interference from other gases and has temperature insensitive absorption lines. During the measurement the lasers are tuned on- and off- a selected CO 2 line near 1572 nm and a selected O 2 line near 768 nm in the Oxygen A band at kHz rates. The lasers use tunable diode seed lasers followed by fiber amplifiers, and have spectral widths much narrower than the gas absorption lines. The receiver uses a 1 -m diameter telescope and photon counting detectors and measures the background light and energies of the laser echoes from the surface. The extinction and column densities for the CO 2 and O 2 gases are estimated from the ratio of the on and offline surface echo via the differential optical absorption technique. Our technique rapidly alternates between several on-line wavelengths set to the sides of the selected gas absorption lines. It exploits the atmospheric pressure broadening of the lines to weight the measurement sensitivity to the atmospheric column below 5 km. This maximizes sensitivity to CO 2 in the boundary layer, where variations caused by surface sources and sinks are largest. Simultaneous measurements of O 2 column will use an identical approach with an O 2 line. Thee laser frequencies are tunable and have narrow (MHz) line widths. In combination with sensitive photon counting detectors these enables much higher spectral resolution and precision than is possible with passive spectrometer. 1 aser backscatter profiles are also measured, which permits identifying measurements made to cloud tops and through aerosol layers. The measurement approach using lasers in common-nadir-zenith path allows retrieving CO 2 column mixing ratios in the lower troposphere irrespective of sun angle. Pulsed laser signals, time gated receiver and a narrow receiver field-of-view are used to isolate the surface laser echo signals and to exclude photons scattered from clouds and aerosols. Nonetheless, the optical absorption change due to a change of a few ppO 2 is small, 600 : 1 are needed to estimate CO 2 mixing ratio at the 1 - 2 ppm level. We have calculated characteristics of the technique and have demonstrated aspects of the laser, detector and receiver approaches in th e laboratory We have also measured O 2 in an absorption cell, and made C 02 measurements over a 400 m long (one way) horizontal path using a sensor breadboard. We will describe these and more details of our approach in the paper...|$|R
