5|$|The first verse of {{the text}} {{is used for the}} opening and final {{sections}} of the aria; the second verse for the middle section. Both verses have an identical rhyming scheme. The form of the verses is based on the style perfected by Metastasio, including the placement of poetic stress. Each line has seven sung syllables; the first two lines of each verse close with the <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> the penultimate syllable (versi piani), the final line of each with <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> the last syllable (verso tronco).|$|E

An example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the pallid sturgeon, a North American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity.|$|E
40|$|Distribution of {{stresses}} about rectangular openings excavated in {{bedded rock}} was investigated {{by means of}} photoelastic experiments using 37 kinds of models made of gelatine jelly. By those model experiments, influence of ratio of the breadth to {{the height of the}} opening, thickness and elastic modulus of immediate roof and high roof, thickness of packs in the goaf, and fissures contained in the immediate roof or the high roof on the distribution of stresses around the opening was studied. Influence of the thickness of immediate roof, height of caved rocks in the goaf or rigidity of face props in long wall working face were investigated as well. As the results of those experiments, following conclusions were obtained : 1. The tensile stresses of the roof in the bedded rock are larger than these stresses which arise in the non-bedded rock, and the tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the roof are larger than the tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the floor. 2. When the immediate roof is thick, the tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the roof and the compressive <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the side walls are considerably smaller than those stresses which arise when the immediate roof is thin. 3. When the high roof is thick, the tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the roof are still more small, and the compressive <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the side walls are a little larger than these stresses which arise when the high roof is thin. 4. When the modulus of elasticity of the immediate roof is large, the tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the roof are larger and the compressive <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the side walls are smaller than these stresses which arise when the modulus of elastisity of the immediate roof is large. 5. The compressive <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the face decrease as the thickness of the packs in the goaf increases. However, the magnitudes of tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the roof undergo only little change. 6. When the immediate roof is fissured, tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the roof are almost equal to zero. 7. When the high roof is fissured, the tensile stresses are larger as compared with the case in which the high roof is not fissured. 8. The compressive <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the long wall face decrease as the height of caved rocks in the goaf increases. 9. The compressive <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the face decrease as the rigidity of face props increases...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{addressed}} to use knowledge about the orthodontic system with numerical simulation of the nite elements method. For the rst time we simulated the <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the orthodontic system and, in this manner, calculated the orthodontic force on the tooth. A 3 D orthodontic model or orthodontic system was designed resembling moderate crowding in the dental arch with all supporting structures. CATIA V 5 computer software was used {{to set up a}} model for the orthodontic system and ABAQUS was used for simulation of the <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the orthodontic system. Our attention was focused <b>on</b> the <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the tooth lateral incisor and its periodontal ligament. The results of the numerical simulation showed complex <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the tooth lateral incisor and its periodontal ligament. In this paper is presented a calculation of the orthodontic force acting on the tooth lateral incisor due to the orthodontic wire. This orthodontic force was calculated from the <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> the bracket.

Bacterial infection should be considered if a person does not improve with standard treatment, at which point further investigations may be indicated.|$|E
5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.|$|E

Third, sponsoring the natural environment is also very important. And last but not least, ecological products will probably require special sales promotions.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} current problems in Indonesian aviation are poor development {{and maintenance of}} air transportation infrastructure, especially in remote areas.

5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|Before Wilhelm, the knuckleball was {{primarily}} mixed in to older pitchers' repertoires {{at the end}} of their careers to offset their slowing fastballs and to reduce <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> their arms, thereby extending their careers. Wilhelm broke with tradition when he began throwing the pitch as a teenager and threw it nearly every pitch. The New York Times linked his knuckleball with that of modern pitcher R.A. Dickey, as Wilhelm taught pitcher Charlie Hough the knuckleball in 1971, and Hough taught it to Dickey while coaching with the Texas Rangers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, {{groups may}} split {{up when they}} become so large that {{competition}} for resources is problematic, but even then, members of matrilines tend to stick together.

However, these high-ranking females also {{appear to have a}} higher probability of miscarriages and some high-ranking matrilines have inexplicably low fertility. One theory suggests this occurs due to <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> the high-ranking females, although this theory is controversial.|$|E
