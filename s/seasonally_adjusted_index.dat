40|$|<b>Seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> {{inflation}} <b>indexes</b> {{are available}} in official statistics and commonly used for analyzing demand pressure in many developed countries. This paper studies the seasonality of consumer prices in Poland. To address this issue we apply analyses in a {{time as well as}} in a frequency domain. The paper offers tentative calculations of the magnitude of monthly consumer price index variations corresponding with seasonal frequencies. Furthermore, we present the seasonal adjustment procedures applied worldwide and estimate monthly inflation indexes refined from seasonality for Poland. The main conclusion of this paper is that seasonal factors account for about 40 % of monthly inflation volatility, which is, first and foremost, a consequence of specific food price changes over a year. Unprocessed food price dynamics variation is generated in 80 % by seasonality and is ten times higher than CPI variation. Therefore, <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> monthly inflation <b>indexes</b> in January, March, April, September and October are lower than not corrected series. Moreover, the greatest impact of seasonal factors is observed in June, July and August, when reductions in food prices are heightened by clothing sales, and <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>indexes</b> are significantly higher than raw indexes.

40|$|The latest {{official}} {{release of}} the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> output <b>index</b> for Scottish production industries (Divisions 1 to 4 of the 1980 SIC) shows a marked increase (4. 7 %) in the final quarter over the previous quarter last year. This increase is due largely to a dramatic 30 % increase in {{the output of the}} electrical and instrument engineering industries in the final quarter. However, considering the overall performance of the UK manufacturing industry (including the electrical and instrument engineering industries which experienced a more modest growth of 3 % in the same period), and given all the information contained in various business surveys, such a substantial increase in Scottish production output should, we think, be treated with caution...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we reevaluate the {{evidence}} of seasonality in prices which we find to be substantially greater than previous research has indicated. That is, seasonal price movements have become more prominent in the relatively stable inflation environment that has prevailed since 1982. One main conclusion is drawn from this analysis: The amount of seasonality in prices differs greatly by item, {{making it difficult to}} generalize about seasonal price movements. A casual reading fails to reveal an easily identifiable origin of the seasonal variation of prices. That is, seasonality in consumer prices is predominantly idiosyncratic in nature, a result that contrasts with studies demonstrating a common seasonal cycle in real economic variables. This finding has an important practical implication: Given the selective, disaggregated approach taken by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to <b>adjust</b> data <b>seasonally,</b> the existence of idiosyncratic seasonality increases the likelihood of allowing noise in the aggregate CPI at a seasonal frequency. This argues in favor of <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusting</b> the <b>index</b> after aggregation. ...|$|R

Our last forecast was led to point to the wrong directions in both of the above cases. The present forecast is based on the revised official data and National Institute's revised UK output forecast. The latter has been revised down quite substantially from the previous forecast. Our present forecasting period extends to the fourth quarter of 1993...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is the {{representation}} and the comparison of univariate time series and interest rate models with reference to the one-step-ahead forecasts of the inflation rate. The analysis is based on the monthly <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> price <b>index</b> for the living standard of all private households in West Germany in the periods 1 / 1963 to 12 / 1994 in-sample and 1 / 1995 to 1 / 1999 out-of-sample. With the comparison of an ARMA(1, 1) time series model, an ARMA(1, 1) interest rate model and a naïve interest rate model in-sample a construction dependent superiority of the time series model is determined. Within the out-of-sample period for none of the specified models is a better forecast performance statistically provable. This is attributed to the variability of monthly changes of the historical West German inflation rate falling over time. Altogether, the economically founded interest rate models — in particular the naïve interest rate model, which can be regarded as an approximation of the subtler ARMA interest rate model — seem to become more attractive out-of-sample. 1...|$|R

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{forecast of}} a small fall in the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> output <b>index</b> for Scottish production industries (Divisions 1 to 4 of the 1980 SIC) {{for the third quarter}} last year was not borne out by the actual outcome. This is mainly due to a large under-reporting of the index for the second quarter last year in the previous official data release. It is now clear that the prolonged recession, and particularly the substantial fall in output in the second quarter contributed significantly to the deterioration of business confidence as reported in the previous Scottish Chambers' business surveys (which should also affect the early official recording of the second quarter's output). This under-reporting leads our model to predict a further fall, although small, in the following quarter. However, the actual outcome of industrial output, total volume of sales and new orders in the third quarter turned out to be not as bad as we had been expecting (see also the following business survey section). Nevertheless, as data reveal in this paper, we are expecting a large fall in production for 1992 as a whole. There will be a further marked reduction in Scottish industrial output...|$|R

40|$|Aerial {{videography}} {{and modeling}} {{were used to}} evaluate the impacts of four hydropower operational scenarios at Flaming Gorge Dam, Utah, on trout and native fishes in the Green River, Utah and Colorado. The four operational scenarios studied were year-round high fluctuations, <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> high fluctuations, <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> moderate fluctuations, and <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> steady flows. Impacts on trout were evaluated by examining differences among scenarios in the areas of inundated substrates that serve as spawning and feeding habitat. All scenarios would provide at least 23 acres per mile of habitat for spawning and food production; <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> operations would provide additional areas during periods of sustained high release. <b>Seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> high fluctuations would increase inundated areas by 12 to 26 % for a short period in winter and spring, but food production and reproduction would not be expected to increase. <b>Seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> moderate fluctuations and steady flows would produce similar increases in area, but the longer period of inundation could also result in increased food production and provide additional spawning sites for trout. Impacts on native fishes were assessed by examining daily changes in backwater nursery areas. Compared with year-round high fluctuations, the daily changes in backwater area would decrease by about 47, 89, and 100 % under the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> high fluctuation, moderate fluctuation, and steady flow scenarios, respectively. Similarly, daily stage fluctuations during the nursery period would decrease by 72, 89, and 100 % under the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> high fluctuation, moderate fluctuation, and steady flow scenarios, respectively. These reductions in daily fluctuations in backwater area and stage would improve conditions in nursery habitats and could in turn improve recruitment and overwinter survival.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the development of}} Flaming Gorge Reservoir release patterns and resulting downstream flows and stages for four potential hydropower operational scenarios. The release patterns were developed for three representative hydrologic years: moderate, dry, and wet. Computer models were used to estimate flows and stages in the Green River resulting from these release patterns for the moderate water year. The four hydropower operational scenarios for Flaming Gorge Dam were year-round high fluctuating flows, <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> high fluctuating flows, <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> moderate fluctuating flows, and <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> steady flows. The year-round high fluctuating flow scenario assumes that the monthly total reservoir releases {{would be the same}} as historical releases. The remaining <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> flow scenarios would comply with the 1992 Biological Opinion of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which requires high flows in the spring and limited hourly fluctuations, especially in summer and autumn releases, to protect endangered fish. Within one year, the maximum daily river stage fluctuations resulting from hydropower operations under the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> high fluctuating flow scenario would be similar to the maximum daily fluctuations under the year-round high fluctuating flow scenario. However, reduced or no fluctuations would occur in some time periods under the former scenario.
