5|$|Byzantine writers {{held the}} Slavs in low {{regard for the}} simple life they led and also for their {{supposedly}} limited combat abilities, but in fact they were already {{a threat to the}} Danubian boundaries of the Empire in the early 6th century, where they waged plundering expeditions. Procopius, the anonymous author of Strategicon, and Theophylact Simocatta wrote at some length {{on how to deal with}} the Slavs militarily, which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary. John of Ephesus actually goes as far as <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last quarter of the 6th century that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army. The Balkan Peninsula was indeed soon overrun by the Slavic invaders during the first half of the 7th century under Emperor Heraclius.|$|E

500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were well}} received from critics. IGN remarked that Wipeout 64 was a superior game to F-Zero X.

Despite the considerable praise, a negative review came from Joe Fielder of GameSpot, saying that regarding the graphics, the visuals in Wipeout 64 {{did not meet the}} par set by Wipeout 2097 that was released for the PlayStation two years prior. Fielder noted, however, that the new multiplayer mode was the game's main advancement over the previous titles.|$|E

500|$|Milk's {{reception}} by the gay {{political establishment}} in San Francisco was icy. Jim Foster, who had by then {{been active in}} gay politics for 10 years, resented the newcomer's asking for his endorsement for a position as prestigious as city supervisor. Foster told Milk, [...] "There's an old <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party. You don't get to dance unless you put up the chairs. I've never seen you put up the chairs." [...] Milk was furious at the patronizing snub, and the conversation {{marked the beginning of}} an antagonistic relationship between the [...] "Alice" [...] Club and Harvey Milk.

500|$|During the 1960s and 70s this {{attitude}} was changing, with Lord Denning <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Laker Airway case that [...] "seeing that the prerogative is a discretionary {{power to be}} exercised for the public good, it follows that its exercise can be examined by the courts just as any other discretionary power which is vested in the executive." [...] The most authoritative case on the matter is Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service, generally known as the GCHQ case. The House of Lords confirmed that the application of judicial review would be dependent {{on the nature of}} the government's powers, not their source. Foreign policy and national security powers are considered outside the scope of judicial review, while the prerogative of mercy is considered within it, as per R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the singer}} was still seething {{about how the}} media had treated her unfairly {{over the last two}} years. When she started working with {{producer}} Dave Hall on the album, she wrote an answer song for the media. Titled [...] "Human Nature", it directly addressed the media and the press who had criticized her for dealing with taboo issues with her previous record and tried to punish her for that. [...] "I'm <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> song that I'm giving my back to them. I'm not sorry", Madonna explained. Described by Billboard as [...] "Madonna taking on her critics more directly than ever with a logical, defiant attack on slut-shaming", the song was also about closing the book on the previous two years of her life.

500|$|Although Clouzot's {{reputation}} {{had grown}} internationally, he lost notability in French cinema due to {{rise of the}} French New Wave. The New Wave directors refused to take Clouzot's thriller films seriously, and expressed their displeasure publicly through articles and reviews in the film criticism publication, Cahiers du cinéma. Clouzot took their criticism to heart, <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magazine Lui that he didn't find his films Diabolique and Miquette et Sa Mère [...] important or interesting anymore. The next film he worked on was L'Enfer, which was never completed. The film examines the sexual jealousy of a man towards his flirtatious wife, whose psychological state deforms everything with desire. Lead actor Serge Reggiani fell ill one week after shooting began {{and had to be}} replaced. Clouzot himself also became ill during production, which led doctors and insurance agents to order the production be stopped. Between 1965 and 1967, Clouzot filmed for French television five documentaries of Herbert von Karajan conducting Verdi's Requiem, Dvořák's New World Symphony, Schumann's 4th Symphony, Beethoven's 5th Symphony and Mozart's 5th Violin Concerto. After production finished on the documentaries, Clouzot was able to finance his final picture.|$|E
500|$|In the lyrics, Lo compares {{falling in}} love to being under the {{influence}} of drugs. Regarding the track's composition, she stated that [...] "all of the verses are drug references. It is comparing a high to being in love, which I think can be kind of the same thing". According to Scandipop, the artist is <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lyrics that [...] "no – she's not on drugs, it's all that amazing love she's in which is making her so high". Carrie Battan of Pitchfork wrote that Lo insists [...] "she's back on her feet and reaching for the stars—she's not on drugs, she's just in love" [...] in the verse, [...] "I'm up with the kites in a dream so blue / I live in the sky / You come live here, too". The line, [...] "I'm queen of the clouds, make my wish come true" [...] served as the inspiration for the title of the singer's debut album. Both Tim Jonze of The Guardian and Jamieson Cox of Time noted that the track's message contrasted that of [...] "Habits (Stay High)", in which the artist sings about using drugs in order to forget her former boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|The geopolitical {{situation}} tilted further against Smith in December 1974 when the South African Prime Minister BJ Vorster pressured him into accepting a détente initiative involving the Frontline States of Zambia, Tanzania and Botswana (Mozambique and Angola {{would join the}} following year). Vorster had concluded that Rhodesia's position was untenable and that South African interests {{would be better served}} by collaborating with black African governments over a Rhodesian settlement; he hoped that success in this might win South Africa some international legitimacy and allow it to retain apartheid. Détente forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup, and required the Rhodesians to release the ZANU and ZAPU leaders so they could attend a conference in Rhodesia, united under the UANC banner and led by Muzorewa. When Rhodesia stopped releasing black nationalist prisoners on the grounds that ZANLA and ZIPRA were not observing the ceasefire, Vorster harried Smith further by withdrawing the South African Police, which had been helping the Rhodesians patrol the countryside. Smith remained stubborn, <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> run-up to the conference that [...] "We have no policy in Rhodesia to hand over to a black majority government" [...] and that his government instead favoured [...] "a qualified franchise for all Rhodesians... ensure that government will be retained in responsible hands for all times".|$|E

500|$|In February 2010, Cyrus {{announced}} that her then-untitled third studio album {{would be released}} later that summer, which she felt was appropriate because it is [...] "good to blast in your car." [...] Later that April, it was {{announced that}} the record would be titled Can't Be Tamed, and would be released on June 22, 2010 in the United States. Consequently, it became the first project from Hollywood Records to be released under the [...] "day-and-date" [...] format, which allowed the project to be released nearly simultaneously worldwide instead of traditionally [...] "staggering" [...] its launch to accommodate [...] "the availability of the artist" [...] internationally. On May 7, Cyrus unveiled the album artwork through her website; it depicts Cyrus dressed in a leather jacket, pants, and midriff-baring shirt while standing against a black-and-white background. It was noted for establishing an increasingly provocative public image for Cyrus; her stylist Simone Harouche stated that it was inspired by singer Joan Jett and the band Blondie, and was [...] "basically a strong statement <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most simple way, that she can’t be tamed–literally and metaphorically." [...] A deluxe version of the record was simultaneously released, which included the audio disc packaged with the standard version in addition to a bonus DVD that includes previously unseen footage from Cyrus' performance at The O2 Arena during the Wonder World Tour.|$|E
500|$|George III {{is often}} accused of obstinately {{trying to keep}} Great Britain {{at war with the}} revolutionaries in America, despite the {{opinions}} of his own ministers. In the words of the Victorian author George Trevelyan, the King was determined [...] "never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal." [...] The King wanted to [...] "keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse". However, more recent historians defend George by <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of the times no king would willingly surrender such a large territory, and his conduct was far less ruthless than contemporary monarchs in Europe. After Saratoga, both Parliament and the British people were in favour of the war; recruitment ran at high levels and although political opponents were vocal, they remained a small minority. With the setbacks in America, Prime Minister Lord North asked to transfer power to Lord Chatham, whom he thought more capable, but George refused to do so; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in Lord North's administration, but Chatham refused to cooperate. He died later in the same year. In early 1778, France (Britain's chief rival) signed a treaty of alliance with the United States and the conflict escalated. The United States and France were soon joined by Spain and the Dutch Republic, while Britain had no major allies of its own. Lord Gower and Lord Weymouth both resigned from the government. Lord North again requested that he also be allowed to resign, but he stayed in office at George III's insistence. Opposition to the costly war was increasing, and in June 1780 contributed to disturbances in London known as the Gordon Riots.|$|E
500|$|Merryman had a {{relationship}} with stock car racing driver Jeff Gordon. She first met Gordon in 2000 while she was employed in Palm Beach, Florida at a Neiman Marcus store in a mall where she advised customers about cosmetics products. Merryman did not recognize the race-car driver at their first meeting, though her friends were excited to meet him during the same encounter. Initially Merryman turned down Gordon's request to take her out for lunch. One year after their initial encounter, they began {{a relationship}}. They were romantically-linked for 11 months. Merryman and Gordon vacationed together in Saint-Jean, Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean in January 2003 to celebrate the New Year. This relationship caused difficulty for his then-ongoing marriage to Brooke Sealy. Sealy discovered Gordon's relationship with Merryman and subsequently divorced the race-car driver. Gordon's wife, who also went by the name Jennifer Brooke Gordon, cited Merryman by name in her divorce papers with the racecar driver. Merryman was featured in the October 2003 issue of Playboy magazine, where she was interviewed about her relationship with Gordon. Merryman stated that Gordon had confided in her: [...] "He got married when he was 23 and has been on the racetrack since he was a kid. He used to tell me all the time he {{never had a chance to}} have fun." [...] She reflected on what she had learned after her period of time with Gordon, <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future she would avoid relationships both with men of his occupation and those who were married. Gordon did not comment on Merryman's 2003 appearance in the magazine. When asked about the article, Gordon refused to comment on it. He stated: [...] "It's not even worth commenting on. All I want to talk about is being fast". Gordon's divorce was finalized in June 2003.|$|E
