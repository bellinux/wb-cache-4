40|$|Measurement of {{relative}} near-view <b>scenic</b> beauty and prediction {{of changes in}} <b>scenic</b> beauty with timber stand management, grazing, and downed wood management are necessary to integrate <b>scenic</b> beauty into the multiple use decision-making framework. Although traditional landscape quality assessment procedures are of limited use in measuring or predicting the relative <b>scenic</b> beauty of near-view forest scenes, extension of psychophysical methods to measurement of forest <b>scenic</b> beauty offers an approach to effectively incorporate <b>scenic</b> beauty into forest management. Biological and physical variables were inventoried at sites within ponderosa pine timber stands in northern Arizona. Four color slides, also taken at those sites, were later rated for <b>scenic</b> beauty by groups of people, and the ratings were scaled to provide <b>scenic</b> beauty estimates per site. Highly significant multiple regression models, expressing <b>scenic</b> beauty {{as a function of}} the biophysical variables, accounted for up to 60, 50, and 80 percent of the variance in <b>scenic</b> beauty for pre-harvest sites, post-harvest sites, and pre-harvest timber stands, respectively. It seems possible at this point to specify a general ponderosa pine model, to be calibrated for specific damage-free areas within the Southwest. Herbage and large ponderosa pine contribute to <b>scenic</b> beauty, while numbers of small pine trees, mechanical ground disturbance, and downed wood, especially as slash, detract from <b>scenic</b> beauty. Areas of northerly aspect, lower overstory density, and less tree clumping were preferred. Moderate harvest tends to improve <b>scenic</b> beauty once the stand has recovered from obvious harvest effects. The recovery period can be greatly reduced by slash cleanup. Grazing can seriously detract from <b>scenic</b> beauty. Up to a point, over the range of practical timber stocking levels, increasing stocking results in greater net present worth from timber, forage, and water yields minus management costs, and lower <b>scenic</b> beauty. Beyond that point both net present worth and <b>scenic</b> beauty decline...|$|R
