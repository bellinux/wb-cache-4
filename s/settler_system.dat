It is presented as an eco-efficient alternative that simultaneously enables compliance with current legislation on landfill and wastewater reuse. Initially, an environmental diagnosis of the characteristics and performance of the current sedimentation tank was made. Subsequently, the design of the proposed remodeling of the treatment system, incorporating the recirculation of treated water in the breaker material production process, was developed. Finally, a life-size settler model was created in a test environment in order to start measurements tests and determine the functionality; successfully, after all tests, positive results within the range allowed by national legislation on total suspended-solids concentration (40 ± 0. 01 mg/l) were obtained. Thanks to the cost-benefit and environmental management analysis, a new <b>settler</b> <b>system</b> can be implemented with positive short and long term results for the company...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the British {{legal status of}} aboriginal customary laws and governments in colonial Canada between 1760 and 1860, {{with a view to}} contributing to the debate about their modern legal status under the Canadian constitution. By "colonial Canada" is meant the British colonies of Quebec (1763 - 1791), Upper and Lower Canada (1791 - 1841) and Canada (1841 - 1867). The central argument of the thesis is that there existed in colonial Canada two distinct systems of municipal law one system for settlers and one system (or set of systems) for natives both deriving legitimacy from an over-arching British imperial constitution. The <b>settler</b> <b>system</b> was established by imperial statute, while native systems were recognized by non-statutory principles of imperial law, or "imperial common law". It is argued that the common-law principle of continuity âaccording to which British courts presumed that the laws of peoples subjected to British sovereignty remained in force at common law until abrogated by prerogative or Parliamentary legislation formed the doctrinal foundation of aboriginal rights to customary law and government in colonial Canada. The objective of Part One of the thesis is to construct a theory of imperial law applicable to the unique constitutional history of colonial Canada. To this end, the principle of continuity is analysed both as it was developed in relation to England's early imperial experiences and as it was manifested in statutes and judicial opinions relating to native nations in British North American colonies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Part Two of the thesis applies the general principles of imperial law developed in Part One to Canadian constitutional history. The various municipal legal regimes established under imperial statute for settlers are examined {{in light of the fact}} that the imperial ministry, which retained direct control over Indian policy in Canada until 1860, recognized the continuity of native customary law and government in both unceded and reserved Indian lands. It will be argued that this imperial recognition confirmed the common-law continuity of native law and government. </p...|$|E

This essay reflects on this distinctiveness, and heuristically suggests that reference to the diverse operation of viral and bacterial phenomena can help an understanding of the distinct functioning of colonial and <b>settler</b> colonial <b>systems.</b> While both viruses and bacteria are exogenous elements that often dominate their destination locales, viruses need living cells to operate, while bacteria attach to surfaces and may or may not rely on the organisms they encounter. Similarly, while both colonizers and settler colonizers are exogenous elements that assert their dominance over their destination locales, a colonial system of relationships, unlike a settler colonial one, is premised on the presence and subjugation of exploitable 'Others'. This essay also suggests that this metaphorical conceptualization can facilitate reflection on the decolonization of settler colonial forms...|$|R

Also, given his limited resources and manpower, Irala could do little to check the raids of Portuguese marauders along his eastern borders. Still, Irala left Paraguay prosperous and relatively at peace. Although he had found no El Dorado to equal those of Hernán Cortés in Mexico and Pizarro in Peru, he was loved by his people, who lamented his passing.|$|R

40|$|In 2010, an innovative, {{remotely}} operated retrieval system was deployed to successfully retrieve over 99. 7 % of the radioactive sludge from ten submerged tanks in Hanford's K-West Basin. As part of K-West Basin cleanup, the accumulated sludge {{needed to be}} removed from the 0. 5 meter diameter by 5 meter long settler tanks and transferred approximately 45 meters to an underwater container for sampling and waste treatment. The abrasive, dense, non-homogeneous sludge was the product of the washing process of corroded nuclear fuel.

40|$|This {{research}} project seeks {{to challenge the}} historical and contemporary exclusion of Aboriginal people by negotiating more effective and collaborative relationships between settler and Aboriginal Australians. This is achieved through a cross-cultural and collaborative design which employs two primary theories within environmental management and conservation topics; „nature is contested‟ and „nature is more than human‟. The thesis explores the questions of how Aboriginal and <b>settler</b> knowledge <b>systems,</b> conceptualisations of space and cultural values are represented and how, in comparison, they form commonalities and differences. In acknowledgement of Australia‟s diverse ecological systems and the heterogeneity {{of the people who}} constitute a part of those systems, the thesis questions are most appropriately applied to a small scale geographic location within a focused field. Subsequently, the thesis questions are examined through the fields of human geography and environmental management, and are specifically applied to a well recognised species in the study area; the White-bellied Sea-Eagle. The geographic location for the research is the Jervis Bay region on the south coast of NSW. The research provides insight into both Aboriginal and non-Indigenous experiences pertaining to conservation in the Jervis Bay region, with considerable overlap between the two study-groups, each informing the other. The research findings from both participant groups highlight a continued contestation of Aboriginal knowledge and management practices, due to privileged methods of measurement and comparison to „traditional‟ Aboriginal contexts which rely upon continuity and very little change. Results also indicated conflict between cross-cultural conceptualisations of space, promoting disparity between the two Aboriginal Communities in the study area as well as highlighting existing gaps in the acknowledgement and understanding of Aboriginal and ecological conceptualisations. Finally, the research indicates some commonality between the two groups regarding the cultural significance of the White-bellied Sea-Eagle as well as challenging the science based human-nature dichotomy. The embodied and affective dimensions of human-nonhuman encounters, demonstrates that the Settler science model thus reveals the falsity of its own binary logic. These research findings assist in negotiating cross-cultural differences, encourage further understanding, and empower both Aboriginal and non-Indigenous knowledge systems, conceptualisations of space, and cultural values for the overall interest of improved environmental conservation and management...|$|R

The Sludge Treatment Project (STP) will retrieve sludge from the 105 -K West Integrated Water Treatment <b>System</b> (IWTS) <b>Settler</b> Tanks and transfer it to container SCS-CON- 230 using the <b>Settler</b> Tank Retrieval <b>System</b> (STRS). The sludge will enter the container through two distributors. The container will have a filtration system {{that is designed to}} minimize the overflow of sludge fines from the container to the basin. FAI/ 09 - 91 was performed to quantify the effect of the STRS on sludge distribution inside of and overflow out of SCS-CON- 230. Selected results of the analysis and a system description are discussed. The principal result of the analysis is that the STRS filtration system reduces the overflow of sludge from SCS-CON- 230 to the basin by roughly a factor of 10. Some turbidity can be expected in the center bay where the container is located. The exact amount of overflow and subsequent turbidity is dependent on the density of the sludge (which will vary with location in the Settler Tanks) and the thermal gradient between the SCS-CON- 230 and the basin. Attachment A presents the full analytical results. These results are applicable specifically to SCS-CON- 230 and the STRS filtration system's expected operating duty cycles...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the rapid environmental degradation and socioeconomic decline to {{which many of}} New Zealand's lowland regions have succumbed. In the last 150 years, {{it is estimated that}} 90 % of the country’s indigenous wetlands and swamp forests have been drained and converted to farming pastures and low-density urban sprawl. This thesis critiques existing settlement patterns, investigating innovative urban forms that work dually to reactivate the wetland environments while increasing population density to levels required for public systems to function sustainably and vitally. These objectives are explored using design-led research, investigating a site-specific scenario in Kāpiti, Wellington region. The design project identifies a squared-off suburban conservation wetland, transforming it into a new Wetland Square: a civic heart of the region’s natural and cultural heritage with reference to the town square urban type. A Market Pier extends from the urban edge of the town square towards the central lagoon. This architectural intervention connects the new urban centre with the wider agricultural activity of Kāpiti while reinstating the historic functions and cultural significance of the wetlands which indigenous Māori historically navigated by canoe in search of food and resources. The research rethinks land conservation practice in New Zealand’s settled regional landscapes. It advocates that conservation efforts should expand beyond current land protection measures to also consider conserving the historic relationship between early <b>settlers</b> and natural <b>systems.</b> The thesis stresses architecture’s responsibility to reconcile urban and ecological systems, with emphasis on celebrating the rich social and cultural heritage associated with New Zealand’s natural heritage to ensure environmental and community resilience in the regional landscape...|$|R

The extraction plant {{is made up of}} a steam generation unit (boiler), stripping chamber, condenser (heat exchanger), decanter (<b>settler),</b> cooling water <b>system</b> and a pressurized gas burner as heat source. The condenser, decanter, steam generation unit, stripping chamber, control valves and the cooling water system were sized and selected {{in such a way that}} the plant will perform to specification. The steam generation unit was designed to contain 25 litres of water with dimension 0. 35 m diameter by 0. 26 m high. The condenser has 24 tubes (i. e. 12 tubes per pass), its size is 1 m long by 0. 215 m shell diameter. The stripping chamber was designed to process a maximum of 10 kg of the raw material per batch run and its size is 0. 35 m diameter by 0. 45 m high while the cooling water system was specified as 200 litres capacity with O.

After the construction, the performance of the plant was evaluated and the following result was obtained: 18 ml of eucalyptus oil only was realized at the end of the eighty - two (82) minutes batch run trial. The overall cost of producing the plant was One hundred and fifty thousand, three hundred and ten Naira only (N 150, 310 : 00), which is affordable to many small and medium scale investors/entrepreneurs and local fabricators with small capital base considering the importance of the eucalyptus oil in Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|The main {{production}} systems detected {{through the field}} research are described as follows:-A. 1 has as the main commercial activity cattle-raising for milk/meat production combined with one cash crop, which {{in the case of}} Gleba XV was cotton. -B. 2 is based upon one important cash crop, cotton or corn, associated in either case with the cultivation of beans, which are sown immediately after the former crop is harvested in April, and which takes advantage of the fertilizer residues and the ploughing carried out to produce the cotton. These activities are the only source of income. -B. 3 is based on mulberry cultivation for silkworm breeding, and on the planting of a cash crop, such as cotton, together with small-scale planting and livestock activities for self-consumption. -C. 4 is the most simple system and is characterized by only one commercial activity, such as cotton, corn or cassava, associated with beans and other planting and animal husbandry for self-consumption. It is, therefore, the least diversified of the systems described. The strategies suggested are: i) to strengthen the position of system B. 2 by definitive incorporation or transformation into a production system like A. 1, that is, to include cattle-raising. Strengthening the position of the intermediate group would mean avoiding the likelihood of declining to a poorer group; ii) to stabilize the situation of system C. 4. Instead of having access to credit for risky cash crops, such as cotton, this settler should benefit from more conservative technical recommendations, such as the strengthening of self-consumption activities and the development of more labour-intensive patterns of production, as in cassava cultivation and cassava-mills for processing and in the development of small animal breeding; iii) to give more attention to ecological and gender issues faced by the <b>settlers</b> in <b>system</b> A. 1, which seems economically strong, but whose situation in these areas could worsen as it gains economic success. To develop diversified production patterns, it is proposed that 30 of the land be devoted to cattle-raising for milk and dairy production, 30 to perennial crops and 30 to annual crops. Generalized mechanization of some tasks within technical itineraries, such as ploughing, though technically recommended and desirable from a modern point of view, is not possible in the short term on account of the scarcity of capital resources (lack of investment credit). Other more abundant resources, such as labour and land, can {{contribute to the development of}} less mechanized activities which might generate, in the medium term, the capital needed to buy machinery. In order to stabilize the settlements it is important to expand viable {{production systems}} and generate acceptable revenues among the settlers.

40|$|This Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study {{addresses}} the Sludge Treatment Project (STP) Engineered Container Retrieval and Transfer System (ECRTS) preliminary design for retrieving sludge from underwater engineered containers {{located in the}} 105 -K West (KW) Basin, transferring the sludge as a sludge-water slurry (hereafter referred to as 'slurry') to a Sludge Transport and Storage Container (STSC) located in a Modified KW Basin Annex, and preparing the STSC for transport to T Plant using the Sludge Transport System (STS). There are six, underwater engineered containers located in the KW Basin that, {{at the time of}} sludge retrieval, will contain an estimated volume of 5. 2 m{sup 3 } of KW Basin floor and pit sludge, 18. 4 m{sup 3 } of 105 -K East (KE) Basin floor, pit, and canister sludge, and 3. 5 m{sup 3 } of settler tank sludge. The KE and KW Basin sludge consists of fuel corrosion products (including metallic uranium, and fission and activation products), small fuel fragments, iron and aluminum oxide, sand, dirt, operational debris, and biological debris. The settler tank sludge consists of sludge generated by the washing of KE and KW Basin fuel in the Primary Clean Machine. A detailed description of the origin of sludge and its chemical and physical characteristics can be found in HNF- 41051, Preliminary STP Container and <b>Settler</b> Sludge Process <b>System</b> Description and Material Balance. In summary, the ECRTS retrieves sludge from the engineered containers and hydraulically transfers it as a slurry into an STSC positioned within a trailer-mounted STS cask located in a Modified KW Basin Annex. The slurry is allowed to settle within the STSC to concentrate the solids and clarify the supernate. After a prescribed settling period the supernate is decanted. The decanted supernate is filtered through a sand filter and returned to the basin. Subsequent batches of slurry are added to the STSC, settled, and excess supernate removed until the prescribed quantity of sludge is collected. The sand filter is then backwashed into the STSC. The STSC and STS cask are then inerted and transported to T Plant...|$|R
40|$|Indigenous peoples {{throughout}} the Americas are often targets of violence stemming from settler colonial societies that would position Indigenous peoples {{on the outskirts}} of mainstream, often Eurocentric societies. For Indigenous people, the systemic violence against them works to erase all Indigenous identities from dominant non-Indigenous societies. Even as Indigenous identities in general are targets of systemic violence, there are two subgroups within a larger Indigenous community that are targeted for violence more often than the overall Indigenous community-Indigenous women and those individuals who identify in ways that deviate from the dominant society's preferred heteronormative and gender-binary identities. Queer Indigenous people and Indigenous women represent the minority of a minority who are hunted in an effort to erase their divergent identities entirely. Through the examination of prose, film, poetry and social movements, I will address the question of how these Indigenous peoples can begin to recover from this systematic violence against two of their subpopulations through the creation of memorials to the victims. Through memorialization, Indigenous populations return power and agency to these victims and continue a quest for justice that will offer psychological healing for victims, their families, and a larger Indigenous population. Through the process of memorializing the divergent and individual identities of these victims of sexuality, gender, and gender expression driven violence, art and social media begin the process of obtaining justice through rediscovering and revalidating these identities. Chapter One explores questions of jurisdiction in crimes against Native women as presented in Louise Erdrich's novel The Round House. The jurisdictional challenges faced by Geraldine Coutts and her family following her sexual assault and attempted murder prevent justice from being served against her attacker. Without justice, Geraldine and her family are not able to heal fully from the trauma of the crime. Chapter Two discusses the documentary Finding Dawn and Canada's Indigenous women. Christine Welsh, the film's director, tells personal stories of some of the victims of violence against Indigenous women in Canada in an effort to begin a larger conversation about the systemic attacks against Indigenous women and the lack of attention these victims receive from the Canadian government. Welsh's documentary gives faces to a few of the names on Canada's list of missing and murdered Indigenous women and memorializes the victims in very personal ways so that their families may begin to heal. Chapter Three addresses the poetry of Qwo-Li Driskill, and explores hir use of memorial to heal psychological wounds in "Love Poems for Billy Jack", "Chantway for FC," and "Gay Nigger Number One. " Driskill's representation of queer Indigenous and non-Indigenous people and the systemic violence against them re-humanizes the victims in an effort to return power to the powerless. Chapter Four explores the ongoing social movements guided by the hashtag #MMIW (Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women) on social media and by public protests in the United States and Canada as global attention is drawn to the violence against Indigenous women and communities. Social media, protests, and ongoing conversations with governments show that the violence against queer Indigenous people and women is not isolated to the pages of literature or the frames of a screen - it is a situation that must be addressed in order to begin to change the <b>settler</b> colonial <b>system</b> that seeks to erase Indigenous identities by violently attacking populations. Like the works of Erdrich, Welsh, and Driskill, the social movements seek to bring wider attention to the violence against Indigenous women and queer Indigenous people. The combined efforts of literature, film, and social movements draw attention to the injustice these people face and demand social change...|$|R

The report by Fauske & Associates, An Experimental Study of the Stability of Vessel-Spanning Bubbles in Cylindrical, Annular, Obround and Conical Containers, is included in Appendix A. Results from the experiments confirm that the gravity yield parameter, Y{sub G}, correctly includes container size and {{can be applied to}} full-scale containers to predict the possibility of the formation of a stable vessel spanning bubble. The results also indicate that a vessel spanning bubble will likely form inside the STSC for KE, KW, and Settler sludges if the shear strengths of these sludges exceed 1820, 2080, and 2120 Pa, respectively. A passive mechanism installed in the STSC is effective at disrupting a rising sludge plug and preventing the sludge from plugging the vent filter or being forced out of the container. The Sludge Treatment Project for Engineered Container and Settler Sludge (EC/ST) Disposition Subproject is being conducted in two phases. Phase 1 of the EC/ST Disposition Subproject will retrieve the radioactive sludge currently stored in the K West (KW) Basin into Sludge Transport and Storage Containers (STSCs) and transport the STSCs to T-Plant for interim storage. Phase 2 of the EC/ST Disposition Subproject will retrieve the sludge from interim storage, treat and package sludge for disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The STSC is a cylindrical container; similar to previously used large diameter containers. A STSC (Figure 1) with a diameter of 58 inches will be used to transport KE and KW originating sludge (located in Engineered Containers 210, 220, 240, 250, and 260) to T-Plant. A STSC with an annulus (Figure 2) will be used to transport Settler Tank sludge, located in Engineered Container 230. An obround small canister design was previously considered to retrieve sludge from the basin. The obround design was selected in Small Canister Design Selection, PRC-STP- 00052. However, the small canister was not selected for transporting the sludge. The STSC was selected for sludge loading and transport to T-Plant as discussed in Decision Report for Direct Hydraulic Loading of Sludge into Sludge Transport and Storage Containers, PRC-STP- 00112.

L'objectif principal de ce travail est de montrer qu'une alimentation séquentielle d'un réacteur parfaitement agité avec maintien permanent du recyclage des boues et de l'oxygénation permet d'obtenir une bonne épuration tant du point de vue de l'élimination de la pollution carbonée que de la maîtrise de la décantabilité des flocs microbiens. Les essais sont menés sur un pilote de laboratoire constitué d'une colonne à bulles et d'un décanteur, alimenté avec un substrat synthétique. Contrairement à une alimentation continue, {{la mise en place}} de cycles d'alimentation permet d'obtenir des flocs de bonne décantabilité de manière constante dans le temps. Ainsi une concentration élevée en biomasse peut être maintenue dans le réacteur. De plus, le suivi d'un cycle 1 h/ 1 h confirme que la mise en œuvre d'un cycle court n'entraîne pas de variations importantes des performances d'épuration. Par ailleurs, le suivi d'un long cycle (24 h/ 24 h) montre des variations significatives des concentrations en DCO, polysaccharides dans la phase liquide et exopolysaccharides dans les flocs microbiens. Ceci semble indiquer que des produits microbiens sont relargués des flocs vers la phase liquide pendant l'arrêt de l'alimentation et que des exopolysaccharides sont produits dans les flocs pendant l'alimentation. The {{overall efficiency}} of an activated sludge {{wastewater treatment system}} depends both on the ability of the activated sludge culture to remove the soluble organic pollution and on the efficiency of the separation of the treated water from the biomass. In the treatment of a high-strength wastewater (COD > 1. 5 kg. m- 3), ultrafiltration or crossflow filtration systems can sometimes substitute for the final clarifier, the separation of the sludge from the effluent water being very good regardless of changes in sludge settleability. Because of the high pollutant concentrations, the biomass must be more concentrated in the bioreactor than in the usual aerobic processes (10 to 20 kg. m- 3 rather than 4 kg. m- 3), whatever the separation <b>system</b> (<b>settler</b> or filtration <b>system).</b> Thus, with this biomass concentration, the volumetric loading rate can be increased while the organic loading rate is maintained at a low level. The use of a clarifier is preferable because it is cheaper than ultrafiltration or crossflow filtration systems, which have very high investment and operation costs, on the other hand, and some fouling problems, on the other hand. However, its use requires a very good biomass settleability. Results from the literature show that there is no general relation between sludge settleability and such wastewater treatment operating parameters as dissolved oxygen concentration in the aeration basin, organic loading rates, pH, or low relative influent nitrogen and phosphorus contents. On the other hand, the separation ability of the clarifier depends on the hydraulic configuration of the aerated reactor: biomass settleability can be controlled by completely stirred reactors in series, plug-flow reactors or intermittently-fed systems. Indeed, this spatial or temporal staggering should allow microorganisms to consume their accumulated substrate and thus restore their accumulation capacity. In the case of high-strength wastewater treatment, temporal staggering is better than spatial staggering. Indeed, higher organic loading rates require a higher number of reactors. Thus, the COD concentration significantly increases in the first reactors of the cascade and some toxic or inhibitory problems could appear. For this reason, a temporal staggering was chosen. Biomass settleability is linked to the extracellular polymers that are the third component of the sludge flocs, after the cells and the water. These polymers are composed largely of microbial exopolysaccharides. Measurements of exopolysaccharides could be used to characterize sludge settleability. A too low level of exopolysaccharides indicates a sludge defloculation problem, whereas a too high level of exopolysaccharides means that sludge settleability could be hindered because of an excessive growth of filamentous organisms. The purpose of the present work is to show that the use of only one completely stirred reactor, fed in a cyclic way with permanent oxygenation and return sludge flow, leads to good sludge settleability and effluent quality. The experiments have been performed with a laboratory pilot-plant composed of a 11. 3 litre bubble column, which is a completely stirred reactor, and a secondary settling tank of 14. 8 litres. The reactor is fed with an equilibrated synthetic substrate consisting mainly of meat extract, saccharose and ethanol (COD:N:P= 100 : 5 : 1 and 1 kg COD= 1 kg meat extract + 0. 444 kg saccharose + 0. 2 kg ethanol). The feeding cycle is a set of consecutive periods of feeding and starvation. For example, during a 1 h/ 2 h feeding cycle, the substrate feeding is continuous during 1 hour and stopped during 2 hours. The sludge comes from the Nancy-Maxéville wastewater treatment plant and its acclimation to the synthetic substrate begins with an aeration without feeding during 12 hours. Afterwards, the experimental system is fed during 1 hour every 2 hours with the substrate (first concentration of COD= 0. 1 kg. m- 3). Then, the inlet COD is increased by steps of 0. 1 kg. m- 3 every day until the required concentration is reached. Once the biomass is acclimated to the influent and sufficiently concentrated, the experiment can begin. In order to show the positive influence of cyclic feeding on wastewater treatment quality, we have carried out one experiment with continuous feeding and two experiments with cyclic feeding (see Table 1). For these experiments, the volumetric loading rate is about 4 kg COD. m- 3. d- 1. With an appropriate feeding cycle, the settleability of the sludge and the effluent quality remain good: the diluted sludge volume index is 56 cm 3. g- 1 and 96 % of the inlet COD is removed. Thus, the biomass concentration remains high in the reactor (19 kg. m- 3). This is not the case with a continuous feeding where the biomass settleability rapidly deteriorates. The principal advantage of sequential feeding is the maintenance of good sludge settleability and a high biomass concentration in the aeration basin. Moreover, during the short feeding cycles, the variations of the concentrations of COD, polysaccharides in the bulk phase and extracellular polysaccharides in the microbial aggregates are very low. This augurs well for system stability. In contrast, monitoring of a long cycle (24 h of feeding and 24 h of starvation) shows great variations in the concentrations of COD, polysaccharides and extracellular polysaccharides in the system. When the feeding is stopped, the COD and polysaccharide concentrations in the bulk phase increase whereas the exopolysaccharide concentration in sludge flocs decreases. Reciprocally, after the feeding is begun, the COD and polysaccharide concentrations in the bulk phase decrease, and then remain constant, whereas the exopolysaccharide concentration increases. As 1 kg of measured polysaccharides represents 0. 9 kg COD, and as in the bulk phase the COD concentration is equivalent to 4 times the polysaccharide concentration, it seems that microbial products other than polysaccharides are released in the bulk phase during starvation, these products being slowly biodegradable. Extracellular polysaccharides in the microbial aggregates are formed during the feeding phase...|$|R
