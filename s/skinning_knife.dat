Thus, {{the aim of the}} present study was to determine microbiological contamination in head meat, the esophagus, diaphragm, and boning scraps and evaluate the hygienic conditions of the processing of these products. The Petrifilm® (3 M) method for determining Enterobacteriaceae, total coliforms, and E. coli was applied for 104 samples. APHA, European Union, PAHO/WHO, and Brazil/MAPA recommendations were followed. Bleeding and <b>skinning</b> <b>knives</b> were contaminated with E. coli (61. 5 %). Regarding the meat cuts, 30. 76 % samples from head meat, the esophagus and the boning flap showed the presence of E. coli in counts up to 2 [*]log[*]CFU/g, while 15. 3 % of the diaphragm samples showed up to 1. 85 [*]log[*]CFU/g. The analyzed comminuted meat was, therefore, shown to be contaminated with E. coli during processing, indicating that end-products from this raw material can offer biological risks...|$|R
6000|$|After {{spending}} two {{or three}} days going about London and enjoying himself with his friend Dick, Frank started for Deal, where he was pleased to find his sister well and happy. He bade goodbye to her, to the doctor, and such of his schoolfellows as lived in Deal, to whom his start for Central Africa was quite an event. Dr. Bateman handed over to him his watch and chain and his blowgun, which he had taken care of for him, also his <b>skinning</b> <b>knives</b> and instruments. The same evening he returned to town, and spent the days very pleasantly until the afternoon came when he was to depart. Then he bade farewell to his kind friends Sir James and Lady Ruthven. Dick accompanied him in the cab to Euston station, where a minute or two later Mr. Goodenough arrived. The luggage was placed in a carriage, and Frank stood chatting with Dick at the door, until the guard's cry, [...] "Take your places!" [...] caused him to jump into the carriage. There was one more hearty handshake with his friend, and then the train steamed out of the station.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} a {{slaughterhouse}} in Khartoum State to assess the meat hygiene practices. Ten critical control points were selected in a cattle slaughter line. They included working tools, air of cattle slaughter hall and various parts of the carcasses. Eight hundred and twelve samples (swabs) were collected and examined bacteriologically during the period of December 2009 to October 2010 to identify the types and species of aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria present in the various critical control points (killing <b>knives,</b> <b>skinning</b> <b>knives,</b> finishing knives, knives used to open of abdomen, beef splitting saw, meat before and after wash, refrigerated meat). A total of 908 isolates were detected, and the main Gram positive bacteria isolates were Staphylococcus caseolyticus (38. 4 %) Staph. capare (4. 2 %), Staph. epidermidis (4. 9 %), Staph. cohnii(0. 22 %), Staph. schleiferi (0. 11 %), Streptococcus pyogenus (3. 99 %), Micrococcus kristinae (11. 09 %), Micrococcus varians(8. 65 %), Bacillus cereus (4. 99 %), Bacillus firmus (0. 22 %), Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (0. 89 %), Aerococcus (22. 51 %), Anaerobic cocci (0. 44 %), Kurthia gibsonii (0. 11 %).

40|$|Background: The {{harvest of}} {{autologous}} skin graft {{is considered to}} be a fundamental skill of the plastic surgeon. The objective of this article is to provide an interesting account of the development of skin grafting instruments as we use them today in various plastic surgical procedures. Materials and Methods: The authors present the chronological evolution and modifications of the <b>skin</b> grafting <b>knife,</b> including those contributions not often cited in the literature, using articles sourced from MEDLINE, ancient manuscripts, original quotes, techniques and illustrations. Results: This article traces the evolution of instrumentation for harvest of skin grafts from free hand techniques to precise modern automated methods. Conclusions: Although skin grafting is one of the basic techniques used in reconstructive surgery yet harvest of a uniform graft of desired thickness poses a challenge. This article is dedicated to innovators who have devoted their lives and work to the advancement of the field of plastic surgery...|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} fact that {{traditional}} African healers have been using ritual and herbal remedies for many centuries, the African people also trust these treatments and find the costs more affordable. Traditional procedures include the following: magic, biomedical methods, fasting, dieting, herbal therapies, bathing, massage, as well as surgery. Surgical procedures often involve cutting a patient’s <b>skin</b> with unsterilized <b>knives.</b> Sometimes, traditional healers apply blood to the skin to rid them of their sickness. Despite the severe distrust of Africans in modern medicine, the Ebola virus has been said to spread rampantly across West Africa due to a shortage of healthcare workers and limited medical resources and facilities. The unsanitary conditions in the overall African region have also made it easier for Ebola to spread.|$|R
5000|$|The ancient {{indigenous}} {{population of the}} Sicels named their villages after geographical attributes of their location. The Sicilian word, katane, means [...] "grater, flaying <b>knife,</b> <b>skinning</b> place" [...] or a [...] "crude tool apt to pare". Other translations of the name are [...] "harsh lands", [...] "uneven ground", [...] "sharp stones", or [...] "rugged or rough soil". The latter etymologies are easily justifiable since, for many centuries following an eruption, the city has always been rebuilt within its black-lava landscape. Around 729 BC, the ancient village of Katane became the Chalcidian colony of Katánē where the native population was rapidly Hellenized. The Naxian founders, coming from the adjacent coast, later used the name for their new settlement along the River Amenano.|$|R

5000|$|The SOG Knife was {{designed}} by Benjamin Baker, the Deputy Chief of the U.S. Counterinsurgency Support Office (CISO). [...] A chrome-moly steel known as SKS-3 was chosen for the blade and hardened to a Rockwell hardness of 55-57. [...] The blade pattern featured a convex false edge on the clip point of a Bowie knife. [...] The stacked leather handle {{was inspired by a}} Marbles Gladstone <b>Skinning</b> <b>Knife</b> made in the 1920s owned by Baker, into which finger grooves were molded. [...] The blade was typically parkerized or blackened to reduce glare. This was done so by applying a dark gun-blue finish (similar to those used on guns) on this carbon steel knife. The knife was carried in a leather sheath which contained a sharpening steel or whetstone.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{materials}} such as wild horses' hair, foxes' fur, sheep's wool and rabbit hides are all used {{in the production of}} various items of clothing. The preparation of these materials includes skinning, drying, and greasing the hides with a mixture of sour milk and flour. After four days, the skins are washed and soaked in a heavily concentrated salt water brine. Following a further period of drying, the underside of the hide is scraped with a <b>skinning</b> <b>knife</b> before being heated. This gives the skin its final, whitish color. The fur is then ready for being dyed in a variety of colors. Yellow dye is made using the crushed root of a Taranovy plant. Red dye is made from the root of a plant called Uiran Boyau, and orange dye is often made from the dried crusts of pomegranates.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the processing methods (F- 1 = to remove skin with pliers and then to cut in fillets; F- 2 = cut in fillet and then to remove <b>skin</b> with <b>knife</b> and pliers help) and weight categories (W- 1 = 250 - 300 g; W- 2 = 301 - 350 g; W- 3 = 351 - 400 g and W- 4 = 401 - 450 g), on the carcass (CY), fillet (FY) and skin yield of Nile tilapia. Forty-eight fishes were used in a completely randomized design. There was effect for the processing method, being the F- 1 mean (56. 43 and 36. 67 %) higher to the F- 2 (53. 46 and 32. 89 %) for CY and FY respectively. For the weight categories, W- 1 (56. 49 and 37. 34 %) and W- 2 (56. 34 and 36. 40 %) were superior as compared to W- 3 (53. 27 and 31. 98 %) and W- 4 (53. 71 and 33. 42 %), respectively for CY and FY. Crude skin percentage, clean and of fleshed were higher for F- 2, but there was no effect for weight categories.

5000|$|This set-back, while {{excluding}} Elliotson {{from the}} medical establishment, ended neither his mesmeric career nor the career of mesmerism in England. From 1842 he became an advocate of phreno-mesmerism [...] - [...] an approach that amalgamated the tenets of phrenology with animal magnetism and {{that led to a}} split in the Phrenological Society. The following year he founded, together with the physician and then President of the Phrenological Society, William Collins Engledue, the principal journal on animal magnetism entitled The Zoist: A Journal of Cerebral Physiology and Mesmerism and their Application to Human Welfare, a quarterly publication which remained in print until its fifty-second issue in January 1856. Mesmeric societies, frequently patronised by those among the scientific and social elite were established in many major population centres in Britain from the 1840s onwards. Some sufficiently endowed societies, such as those in London, Bristol and Dublin, Ireland, supported mesmeric infirmaries with permanent mesmeric practitioners in their employ. Due to the competing rise of spiritualism and psychic research by the mid-1860s these mesmeric infirmaries had closed.The 1840s in Britain also witnessed a deluge of travelling magnetisers who put on public shows for paying audiences to demonstrate their craft. These mesmeric theatres, intended in part as a means of soliciting profitable private clientele, functioned as public fora for debate between skeptics and believers as to whether the performances were genuine or constituted fraud. In order to establish that the loss of sensation under mesmeric trance was real, these itinerant mesmerists indulged in often quite violent methods [...] - [...] including discharging firearms close to the ears of mesmerised subjects, pricking them with needles, putting acid on their <b>skin</b> and <b>knives</b> beneath their fingernails.|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the possibility of}} inflicting serious injuries with sharp objects in an experimental setting by throwing four sharp objects from different distances and with different throwing techniques. Using an overarm-handle (OA/H), overarm-blade (OA/B), underarm-handle (UA/H), underarm-blade (UA/B) and thrust (T/H) throwing technique, 10 adults (sex ratio 1 : 1) threw a chef's knife, a <b>skinning</b> <b>knife,</b> a paring knife and office scissors from 4 m and 2 m distance at synthetic abdomen models made of 10 % gelatin covered with synthetic skin. The amount of hits and penetrations of the target and their penetration depth were noted, as was {{the rotation of the}} blade tip towards the target along its flight trajectory. The chef's knife injury/hit ratio was 0. 167 / 4 m and 0. 160 / 2 m; the <b>skinning</b> <b>knife</b> recorded an injury/hit ratio of 0. 087 / 4 m and 0. 153 / 2 m; the paring knife of 0. 087 / 4 m and 0. 113 / 2 m; and the scissors 0. 087 / 4 m and 0. 067 / 2 m. Mean penetration depths were as follows: the chef's knife: 4 m, 4. 42 cm, 2 m, 3. 41 cm; the skinning knife: 4 m, 4. 19 cm, 2 m, 4. 11 cm; the paring knife: 4 m, 1. 62 cm, 2 m, 1. 55 cm; and the scissors: 4 m, 2. 08 cm, 2 m, 0. 95 cm. Handle-throw penetration-depths were: 4 m: 3. 77 cm and 2 m: 2. 86 cm; blade-throw depths were: 4 m: 3. 14 cm and 2 m: 2. 69 cm. Overarm-throw penetration-depths were: 4 m: 3. 62 cm and 2 m: 3. 25 cm; and underarm-throw penetration-depths were 4 m: 3. 30 cm and 2 m: 2. 30 cm. No thrust-throws with the paring knife and scissors could pierce the target. The tips pointed toward the target at angles of 60 °- 120 °, earlier in handle-throws than blade-throws, especially with the paring knife and the scissors. When thrown, especially with a handle-held technique, heavier objects pierced more often and more deeply. Thrust-throws at short distances are unlikely to pierce a human...|$|E

One on the right came forward and seized me by the neck, when by the strength of the clutch I felt it was no woman's power that pulled me down to the ground. In another second I saw the other would-be woman over me, and remember seeing the steel of the knife come right down upon me, driven by this person's hand. It struck through my clothes and against the whalebone of my stays, which turned the point, merely grazing the <b>skin.</b> The <b>knife</b> was quickly withdrawn and plunged at me again. I seized it with both hands and shouted as loud as I could, when the person who first pulled me down pushed a large handful of earth into my mouth and nearly choked me.

Then I heard a confused sound of rumbling of wheels, and I remember no more. When I came to myself I was quite alone. From what I saw of the knife I believe it to be a dagger, and the persons were undoubtedly men.
