5|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{presents}} evidence that Deng {{was convicted of}} prostitution two years ago. Deng denies the charge and <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been gang-raped by the soldiers who killed her husband. Deng's credibility weakens further when the defense presents a surprise witness, Daniel Achok, who testifies that he had advised her to fabricate the gang rape on her application for political asylum. The jury reached verdicts {{on two of the}} three charges, finding DiStasio guilty of unlawful imprisonment and not guilty of assault but deadlocks on the rape charge, and Benson says that he will likely serve a year in prison.|$|E
5|$|Novick sent Cody's {{screenplay}} to {{his friend}} Jason Reitman; by the time Reitman had read halfway through the script, he felt {{that if he did}} not direct the film, he would regret {{it for the rest of}} his life. Initially, Reitman found it difficult to acquire the script, because his first film, Thank You for Smoking, had not been released yet, so he did not have any feature film credits. Other directors, including Jon Poll, were considered, but Reitman was chosen and he interrupted work on his own spec script in order to direct Juno. Cody <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a cynical attitude when writing Juno ("I didn't ever think this film would be produced") and, indeed, the film was delayed by financial problems. After its controversial nature scared off a number of major studios, John Malkovich's production company, Mr. Mudd, took on the project. It was later brought to production company Mandate Pictures by co-producer Jim Miller.|$|E
5|$|Siglinda Scarpa <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{issues with}} {{communication}} as a child, stating that “people were not seeing me, {{that they were}} talking, but never to me.” It was not until her father brought a stray kitten home and placed it under her sheets that Scarpa felt she could communicate with someone. The kitten was a year old when he became very ill and died. After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included a sanctuary for cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales to make it possible.|$|E

Cruz grew up in Alcobendas, and spent long hours at her grandmother's apartment. She <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a happy childhood. Cruz remembers [...] "playing with some friends and being aware that I was acting as I was playing with them. I would think of a character and pretend to be someone else." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{guest on}} the Marala was Cilla Black, singer {{and a friend}} to the Beatles since the 1960s, who recalls Starr and Harrison playing [...] "Photograph" [...] during an evening get-together, with [...] "everyone on board" [...] {{contributing}} ideas for the lyrics. As with Starr's two singles over 1971–72, [...] "It Don't Come Easy" [...] and [...] "Back Off Boogaloo", Harrison helped write the melody, although [...] "Photograph" [...] would mark {{the first time that}} he was credited as a co-writer with Starr. In her autobiography, Step Inside Love, Black <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> hoped to record the song for a single later in 1971, only to be told by Starr: [...] "No, it's too bloody good for you. I'm having it myself." ...|$|E

500|$|June {{is placed}} into witness {{protection}} at a motel by the Mississippi Highway Patrol. However, Pinker kidnaps June after killing the state trooper assigned to guard her. Pinker discovers his child is actually Trevor, {{who has been}} living with Jackie {{for the past several}} years as her child. Pinker attempts to kidnap Trevor, but is confronted by Mulder, who is armed with a shotgun loaded with rubber bullets. Pinker manages to evade Mulder and continues to chase after Trevor and Scully, whom he quickly corners. Scully, using Mulder's glass insulator hypothesis, locks herself inside a telephone booth with Trevor. [...] After failing to break into the telephone booth, Pinker sees his son trembling before him. Realizing that he does not want to scare his son anymore, Pinker decides to walk away. However, June appears and hits Pinker with her car; he passes through the metal components of the car, but not its glass windshield, and is cut in half as a result, killing him instantly. Mulder goes to June, who <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to do it or else Pinker would have hurt Trevor. She then asks what he [...] wanted, to which Mulder replies [...] "Maybe another chance", causing June to cry.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, Irene and her {{children}} returned {{to live in the}} Netherlands, initially moving back into the palace and became involved in various personal development workshops, trying to [...] "find herself". By 1981, she and {{her children}} had moved to their own home {{across the street from the}} palace, where Irene did traditional household chores like grocery shopping. In 1983 and 1985, she publicly spoke out against the additional deployment of NATO missiles at a large anti-nuclear rally in The Hague and with a letter to the newspaper De Volkskrant. Her connection with nature, that she <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> felt since childhood, intensified, and in 1995 she published her book Dialogue with Nature. The book outlined her philosophy that human beings are alienated from the natural world, but the Dutch media seized upon passages that recounted conversations she said she had with the trees and dolphins.|$|E
2500|$|When Shakira was four, {{her father}} {{took her to}} a local Middle Eastern restaurant, where Shakira first heard the doumbek, a {{traditional}} drum used in Arabic music and which typically accompanied belly dancing. She started dancing on the table, and the experience made her realize that {{she wanted to be a}} performer. She enjoyed singing for schoolmates and teachers (and even the nuns) at her Catholic school, but in second grade, she was rejected for the school choir because her vibrato was too strong. The music teacher told her that she sounded [...] "like a goat". At school, she was often sent out of the class because of her hyperactivity (ADHD). She <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> also been known as [...] "the belly dancer girl", as she would demonstrate every Friday at school a number she had learned. [...] "That's how I discovered my passion for live performance," [...] she says.|$|E
2500|$|In the basement, while Hook contemplates an escape, Zelena {{says that}} her anti-magic cuff is the real problem. Hook says he has magic in his hook, but says that {{the last time he}} helped her, she betrayed him. She says that even though he doesn't know if he can trust her, he has no choice now. He slips off the cuff and she gets rid of her shackles, and puts herself into a fresh outfit, before coming over to Hook and undoing his shackles. Zelena tells Hook they have to sneak out the back, but Hook says he’s not going. When Zelena {{questions}} why, Hook says he needs to stop Emma, and Zelena bids him goodbye. Hook searches Emma's house then takes a painting off the wall, but then, Emma comes in, saying that she was trying to help Hook. Hook finds the squid ink {{on the back of the}} painting and splashes her with it, saying that she’s a villain now, like Regina said. He says she has to tell him what happened in Camelot, but Emma says that he can't make her. Zelena returns and says she that she couldn't leave without making the Dark One pay. Zelena stabs Hook in the chest, but he doesn't bleed or suffer any wounds, and he demands to know what’s happening. She says she found a Dreamcatcher outside, which can explain what happened. Emma whispers to him not to trust her and that she can explain everything. Hook tells Zelena to do it and she shows him his memories. The Dreamcatcher shows Hook his memories in Camelot, before showing him the events involving his current situation. It turns out that Hook was fatally wounded by Excalibur, and in order to save him, Emma tethered his life to Excalibur, which turned into another Dark One. Emma tells him that she’s sorry and <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no choice. Hook says there must be another explanation. Zelena hands Hook the re-united Excalibur and she removes a glamour spell, and shows him that his name is on the bottom part of the sword while Emma’s name is on the dagger end, gloating about them being [...] "the Dark Ones." [...] Emma says she wanted to make up for this, and {{says that her}} plan was the only way to get rid of the darkness in both of them. She says all she did was to try to save him, but Hook is enraged, saying, [...] "So much for our future, Swan." [...] Zelena asks if he’s ready to find out what else happened in Camelot and he says yes, much to Emma's dismay. But Hook tells Zelena that first, they have to take care of Emma.|$|E
