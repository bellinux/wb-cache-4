As coordinator Doolan criticised the Government of Ireland for scrapping the once full-time position of 'Minister for National Drugs Strategy' and regulating that role to another Minister with other responsibilities. As well as calling for a full-time junior minister, Doolan and CityWide requested the government <b>scrap</b> proposed <b>funding</b> cuts for drug services, also asking for additional funding for the issue, {{as well as for}} community participation and consultation for handling the drugs problem.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the year}} 1829, a daymark had been {{constructed}} on the island, but it proved {{not to be}} enough since many ships {{were lost in the}} area. It was demolished during the lighthouse construction. The tower was built after sketches from Swedish lighthouse pioneer Nils Gustaf von Heidenstam. Originally the flame ran on colza oil-lamps and showed red light. In 1884 a kerosene lamp was installed instead, and in 1887 the large lens was changed to a third order fresnel lens with white light. The old lens was divided and placed in two other lighthouses. Electricity came to the island in 1950, but the station was staffed until 1997. It was then one of the last staffed light stations in Sweden along with Söderarm and Holmögadd. In 1978 the old lighthouse was replaced, deactivated and planned for scrapping due to its bad rusty condition. But a rescue group convinced the Swedish Maritime Administration to donate the <b>scrap</b> <b>funding</b> and the lighthouse to them for repairs and historic preservation. They created the Måseskär foundation and works to preserve all light station buildings on the island. The modern lighthouse is still under control of the Swedish Maritime Administration. The old lighthouse is intact and fully operable. Since the year 2000 there is a tradition among the foundation to turn on the light at 00.00 January 1 for a couple of minutes. The island is included as a wind observation station in the shipping news of the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.|$|R
50|$|Macron's plan to {{give his}} wife an {{official}} role within government came under fire with criticisms ranging from it being undemocratic to contradicting his fight against nepotism. Following an online petition of nearly 290,000 signatures on change.org Macron abandoned the plan.

50|$|Though the {{original}} blueprints {{for the school}} included an auditorium {{to be built in}} the space between the separate buildings, budgetary constraints forced plans for the auditorium to be <b>scrapped.</b> By 1987, <b>funding</b> for the auditorium had been secured thanks to donations by the Archbishop Wood Alumni Association. The Sophia A.

There were many requests for programs, sometimes as many as five in one week, and all were met. Hollywood starts were even furnished to Canada to promote the sale of Canadian Victory Bonds.|$|R
50|$|The first DAB station {{network was}} {{deployed}} in Bavaria since 1995 until full coverage in 1999. Other states had funded a station network {{but the lack}} of success led them to <b>scrap</b> the <b>funding</b> - the MDR switched off in 1998 already and Brandenburg declared a failure in 2004. Instead Berlin/Brandenburg began to switch to digital radio based on an audio-only DVB-T mode given the success of the DVB-T standard in the region when earlier analogue television was switched off in August 2003 (being the first region to switch in Germany). During that time the DVB-H variant of the DVB family was released for transmission to mobile receivers in 2004. During 2005 most radio stations left the DAB network with only one public service broadcaster ensemble to remain in the now fully state-funded station network. At last the KEF (commission to determine the financial needs of broadcasters) blocked federal funding on 15. July 2009 until economic viability of DAB broadcasting would be proven - and pointing to DVB-T as a viable alternative.|$|R

5000|$|In May 2010 the new Coalition {{government}} {{said that the}} 'Labour's 13-year war on the motorist is over' and that the new government 'pledged to <b>scrap</b> public <b>funding</b> for speed cameras'. In July Mike Penning, the Road safety minister reduced the Road Safety Grant for the current year to Local Authorities from £95 million to £57 million saying that local authorities had relied too heavily on safety cameras {{for far too long}} and that he was pleased that some councils were now focusing on other road safety measures. It is estimated that as a result the Treasury is now distributing £40 million less in Road Safety Grant than is raised from fines in the year. The cuts include a 27% to the revenue grant used for camera maintenance and education programs and 100% to the capital grant used for road safety measures such as the installation of fixed cameras, speed humps and pedestrian crossings. Brake warned that by removing ring-fencing the cuts could in reality be larger. Penning later said [...] "road safety grant was reduced as this grant was spread evenly across all local authorities, not because this was considered an area of lower priority spending." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Union Modernisation Fund [...] (UMF) was a fund {{established}} in 2005 by the Government of the United Kingdom (at this time {{under the leadership}} of Tony Blair, who was part of the Labour government) with the aim of providing financial support to British trade unions by supporting [...] "innovative modernisation projects which contribute to a transformational change in the organisational effectiveness of a trade union". The fund was overseen by the independent quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation (quango) the Union Modernisation Fund Supervisory Board (officially termed a non-departmental public body), which was part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Three rounds of the UMF were held, with a large amount of money disseminated to trade unions. The Conservatives criticised the fund, calling it a way to keep the unions [...] "sweet", and the then shadow business secretary Alan Duncan called on Gordon Brown to <b>scrap</b> the <b>fund.</b> Only three rounds of funding were ever held, and the board was abolished in 2010 as part of the UK government's quango reforms (as the board's function had been completed). In total the fund gave £7 million to trade unions throughout its existence.|$|R

Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric photometry, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the Small Magellanic Cloud and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|R

They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.The research produced remarkable results: [...] "it meant that the Magellanic Clouds were twice as far away as was previously thought, and if then the baseline is twice as long, the size of the universe is doubled." [...] It also showed that star formation in the Magellanic Clouds had occurred more recently than in the Milky Way. The results overturned the prevailing view that our galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds had evolved in parallel. Gascoigne said of his work: When suddenly all this dropped into place, after I had been working away at it for quite a while, measuring more Cepheids in our own Galaxy and some in the Large Cloud, the feeling of triumph, the great feeling that I had really done something, was wonderful. I had joined the professional astronomers. Not only that, but I truly understood a problem, a proper problem... Subsequent research confirmed what were described as pioneering results, arrived at through very innovative techniques.|$|R
