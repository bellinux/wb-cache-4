5|$|A 2008 <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> {{billing data}} in Indiana {{before and after}} it adopted DST in 2006, and {{concluded}} that DST increased overall residential electricity consumption by 1% to 4%, due mostly to extra afternoon cooling and extra morning heating; the main increases came in the fall. A study estimated the overall annual cost of DST to Indiana households $9 million, with an additional $1.7–5.5 million for social costs due to increased pollution.|$|E
5|$|A 2014 <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> {{the effects}} of {{combined}} NVC and mindfulness training on 885 male inmates of the Monroe Correctional Complex in Monroe, Washington. The training was found to reduce recidivism from 37% to 21%, and the training was estimated as having saved the state $5 million per year in reduced incarceration costs. The training was found to increase equanimity, decrease anger, and lead to abilities {{to take responsibility for}} one's feelings, express empathy, and to make requests without imposing demands.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> {{the effects}} on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E

5|$|Although a 2007 study {{estimated}} that introducing DST to Japan would reduce household lighting energy consumption, a 2007 simulation {{estimated that}} DST would increase overall energy use in Osaka residences by 0.13%, with a 0.02% decrease due to less lighting more than outweighed by a 0.15% increase due to extra cooling; neither <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> non-residential energy use. This is probably because DST's effect on lighting energy use is mainly noticeable in residences.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> the {{histology}} of thin-sectioned dodo bones, modern Mauritian birds, local ecology, {{and contemporary}} accounts, to recover {{information about the}} life history of the dodo. The study suggested that dodos bred around August, after having potentially fattened themselves, corresponding with the fat and thin cycles of many vertebrates of Mauritius. The chicks grew rapidly, reaching robust, almost adult, sizes, and sexual maturity before Austral summer or the cyclone season. Adult dodos which had just bred moulted after Austral summer, around March. The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first, and the moulting would have completed {{at the end of}} July, in time for the next breeding season. Different stages of moulting may also account for inconsistencies in contemporary descriptions of dodo plumage.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a few {{instances}} of fishers preying on cats and small dogs; in Massachusetts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517202212/http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dfw/wildlife/living/living_with_fisher.htm |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |accessdate=August 21, 2016}} but in general, the evidence suggests these attacks are rare. A 1979 <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> the stomach contents of all fishers trapped in the state of New Hampshire; cat hairs were found in only 1 of over 1,000 stomachs. More recent studies in suburban upstate New York and Massachusetts found no cat remains in 24 and 226 fisher diet samples (scat and stomach contents) respectively. While there is popular belief for more frequent attacks on pets, zoologists suggest bobcats or coyotes are more likely to prey upon domestic cats and chickens.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} {{individual}} differences is well established in psychology, but has not been extensively applied to clergy. This dissertation identifies seven areas {{of individual differences}} relevant {{to the field of}} ministry <b>studies</b> and <b>examines</b> each of these areas through two perspectives. The first perspective draws together insight from the wider psychological literature. The second perspective examines new data from a survey conducted among 370 clergy currently serving in the Church in Wales. The <b>study</b> begins by <b>examining</b> the psychological type profile of clergy, drawing on Jung's model of psychological type and using the Francis Psychological Type Scales. Second, the <b>study</b> <b>examines</b> the work-related psychological health of clergy, drawing on the balanced affect model of wellbeing and using the Satisfaction in Ministry Scale and the Scale of Emotional Exhaustion in Ministry. Third, the <b>study</b> <b>examines</b> the preferred ministry styles exercised by clergy using the Payne Index of Ministry Styles. Fourth, the <b>study</b> <b>examines</b> the Emotional Intelligence of clergy using the Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale. Fifth, the <b>study</b> <b>examines</b> the diurnal rhythms displayed by clergy using the Francis Owl Lark Index. Sixth, the study assesses the personality of clergy using the three dimensional model of personality developed by Eysenck. Finally, the <b>study</b> <b>examines</b> the ministry lifestyle modelled by clergy, using a new instrument developed for this survey. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Vaccination of female baboons with this synthetic peptide resulted in a reduced fertility in the trial. However, a second study that examined vaccination of female macaque monkeys with the same synthetic peptide did not find reduced fertility.|$|E
