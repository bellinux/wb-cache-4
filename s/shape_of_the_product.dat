50|$|In 1999 Cédric Boissière and {{his team}} {{developed}} a two-step process whereby the hydrolysis at low pH (1 - 4) is completed before the condensation reaction is initiated {{by the addition of}} sodium fluoride (NaF). The two-step procedure includes the addition of a nonionic surfactant template to ultimately produce mesoporous silica particles. The main advantage of sequencing the hydrolysis and condensation reactions is the ability to ensure complete homogeneity of the surfactant and the precursor TEOS mixture. Consequently, the diameter and <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> particles as well as the pore size are determined solely by the reaction kinetics and the quantity of sodium fluoride introduced; higher relative fluoride levels produces a greater number of nucleation sites and hence smaller particles. Decoupling the hydrolysis and condensation process affords a level of product control that is substantially superior to that afforded by the one-step Stöber process, with particle size controlled nearly completely by the sodium fluoride-to-TEOS ratio.|$|E
5000|$|Van Vliet used a piano—an {{instrument}} he {{had never}} played before—as his main compositional tool. Since he had no experience with the piano and no conventional musical knowledge at all, {{he was able to}} experiment with few preconceived ideas of musical form or structure. Beefheart sat at the piano until he found a rhythmic or melodic pattern that he liked. Mike Barnes compared this approach to John Cage's [...] "maverick irreverence toward classical tradition". John French then transcribed this pattern, typically only a measure or two long, into musical notation. After Beefheart was finished French would then piece these fragments together into compositions, reminiscent of the splicing together of disparate source material on Marker's tape. French decided which part would be played on which instrument and taught each player their part, although Van Vliet had final say over the ultimate <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>product.</b> Band member Bill Harkleroad has remarked on [...] "how haphazardly the individual parts were done, worked on very surgically, stuck together, and then sculpted afterwards." [...] Once completed, each song was played {{in exactly the same way}} every time, eschewing the improvisation that typifies most popular music in favor of an approach more like a formal, classical composition.

30|$|In summary, we {{reported}} {{a simple and}} general one-pot approach to synthesize binary and ternary metal sulfide NCs including Cu 2 S, PbS, ZnS, CdS, Ag 2 S, CdS:Cu(I), and CuInS 2, in which no pre-synthesis organometallic precursors were required. In this reaction, layered metal-thiolate compounds were formed at the early stage, which effectively acted as the precursors to promote <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NCs. <b>The</b> size and <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> could be controlled easily. Importantly, a high red-emissive CdS:Cu(I) was successfully synthesized through this one-pot route, which greatly reduced the operational complexity and offered an alternative method to prepare doped NCs. We believe that this versatile and simple one-pot strategy would open a new methodology for synthesis of other ternary or multinary metal sulfide NCs. More importantly, the different NCs synthesized using this approach exhibited different absorption regions and had distinct photoluminescence properties, making them good candidates for applications in photovoltaic devices and light-emitting devices.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} few decades, {{considerable}} developments have been achieved {{in the area of}} computer-aided polymer processing, such as: injection molding, thermoforming, and profile extrusion. Injection molding {{is one of the most}} important processes of thermoplastic materials. Even though injection molding is simple in principle the real process is quite complex. The complexity of the problem rises from the unsteady and non-isothermal process and the rheological behavior of the molten polymer. The problem is generally solved using numerical techniques and realistic rheological models for quantitative analysis. Usually a good process simulation will predict the final <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> and the location of different defects. One of the major defects in the injection molding process is the formation of weldlines that lead to surface imperfections and weak spots in the part. A weldline is a three dimensional region with complex morphology. The location of the weldline is highly dependable on the location of the gates in the mold and the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>product.</b> In this paper two different parts with visible weldlines will be compared to the simulation results.

40|$|Searching for {{the optimum}} {{conditions}} of plastic deformation of some materials has {{to guarantee a}} possibility of obtaining the final <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> without applying additional grinding. This leads to the necessity of taking {{the advantage of the}} superplasticity effect which allows to obtain the required mechanical properties and <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>product.</b> The superplasticity phenomenon, investigated widely some time ago, is not completely explained. This effect is well observed in the alloys based on Al, Cu, Sn, V, Ti, Co and Fe. The alloys are divided into two groups. The first group includes average melting temperature alloys which show good workability in the superplastic conditions. The second group includes high melting temperature alloys which are of particular interest for the technologists. These alloys, however due to high temperatures and long deformation times require thermal-resistant tools. The strain rate sensitivity parameter m is the main material parameter which determines the superplasticity. That parameter {{is a part of the}} consecutive equation which describes the relationship between the stress and the strain at high temperatures. The materials with the parameter m exceeding the value of 0. 3 are considered to be superplastic. An attempt of establishing the optimum conditions of plastic deformation was undertaken using the torsion test. The tests were carried out at various temperatures and at various strains...|$|E
