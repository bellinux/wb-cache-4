40|$|ABSTRACT: For a crop {{protection}} product to achieve its goal, the product must be applied and remain on the leaves until it is absorbed. This situation may be compromised due to rainfall after spraying, thus necessitating reapplication which increase the overall cost. Application technology {{research has focused on}} alternatives and solutions to mitigate this effect through the use of adjuvants. The objective of this research was to evaluate the deposit of <b>spraying</b> <b>liquid</b> on citrus seedlings using the products spirodiclofen, propargite, imidacloprid, lambda cyhalothrin, copper oxychloride, and copper hydroxide with water mixed with the adjuvants polydimethylsiloxane and phosphatidylcholine. Seedlings were subjected to simulated rains of 10 mm at intervals of 1, 6, 12 and 24 h after spraying, and the remaining deposits of <b>spraying</b> <b>liquid</b> per leaf area were analyzed by spectrophotometry by assessing a metallic marker previously added in the <b>spraying</b> <b>liquids.</b> Variables were subjected to analysis of variance and Tukey's test (P< 0. 05). The rains that occurred soon after spraying resulted in decreased <b>spraying</b> <b>liquids</b> deposits on citrus leaves.

This adjuvant is a new vegetable oil, rich in erucic acid and extracted from Crambe abyssinica. It was formulated with POE-castor oil and a PEG-condensate (advised by ICI). Crambe oil improves slightly the wettability of propiconazole (Tilt 250 EC) spray droplets, without increasing the risk of coalescence or run off. Propiconazole penetrated faster into the leaf surface when crambe oil {{was added to the}} <b>spray</b> <b>liquid</b> and seemed to concentrate in the cuticle of the leaf surface. A rather limited concentration of propiconazole was thus found in the inner leaf tissue. The transport process of propiconazole across the inner leaf compartments was influenced in a positive way by the addition of crambe oil to the <b>spray</b> <b>liquid</b> (Tilt).

The air induction nozzle generated the largest droplet size, the slowest velocity and the lowest <b>spray</b> <b>liquid</b> density. The type of air induction nozzle and spray formulation was also found to influence spray characteristics.

40|$|Dissertation {{is devoted}} to {{experimental}} research, aimed at improving the efficiency of contact heat and mass transfer units by increasing the interfacial surface of heat and mass transfer during the <b>liquid</b> <b>spraying</b> by centrifugal nozzles, implementation of which results in significant savings of material and energy resources. Comprehensive experimental study {{of the characteristics of}} the <b>liquid</b> <b>spraying</b> torch (irrigation density, expansion angle of nozzle torch, the average volume-surface diameter of liquid droplets) was done. The influence of input parameters to the relevant properties was shown and surface area of the <b>sprayed</b> <b>liquid</b> droplets was defined. The limit temperature of water heating and its dependence on initial vapor content in which water is heated to the limit temperature depending on the initial vapor content and dry air output were experimentally set. The parametric borders of effective use of centrifugal mechanical nozzle without evaporation of heated liquid drops were defined. Intensity of heat and mass transfer in the contact gas-droplet unit with centrifugal nozzle in terms of heat utilization of energy units? exhaust gases was experimentally researched. The empirical dependences for calculating the average heat transfer and mass transfer coefficients relating to the actual surface of the <b>sprayed</b> <b>liquid</b> droplets are obtained for the first time. The peculiarities of transfer processes in the gas-droplet system were determined and generalized dependence for heat and mass transfer were received.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare a selection of spray application techniques with different application volumes, with respect to the <b>spray</b> <b>liquid</b> distribution on flat surfaces, the deposition in fully developed crops and the biological effect. The spray application techniques in this study were conventional spray technique with three different nozzles: Teelet XR, Lechler ID and Lurmark DriftBeta, and also AirTec, Danfoil, Hardi Twin, Kyndestoit and Släpduk. The dynamic <b>spray</b> <b>liquid</b> distribution was measured on a flat surface, spraying a water and black dye solution on pre-glued wallpaper lengths. Spraying the same dye-water solution in established crops, the spray deposition on plant and on the ground was studied by measuring the absorbance of sampled leafs' and collectors' rinsing water. Spray deposition studies were made in winter wheat and potato. The biological effect was studied in field experiments with plots with linearly increased dose. The field trials in this study were weed control in spring barley, fungi control in winter wheat and potato late blight control. The weed weight was sampled and visual assessments were made of the infection of fungi. Grain yield and 1000 -kernel-weight were sampled in the wheat trial. The dynamic <b>spray</b> <b>liquid</b> distribution resulted in coefficients of variation, for all spray techniques, between 5 % and 16 %, which were considered to be at acceptable levels. Relatively large significant differences were found in the spray deposition measurements in potato canopies. For conventional spray technique, 90 % spray deposition was recovered in the top of the canopy. Higher deposition was recovered in the lower part of the canopy and on the ground for Danfoil, Hardi Twin and Släpduk than the other techniques. In the wheat crop, the differences in spray deposition between spray techniques were smaller. Släpduk had the greatest increase in liquid deposition on the head and the flag leaf. The techniques with external air assistance, Hardi Twin and Kyndestoft, had the lowest deposition on the ground. Analysing the effect of weed control in spring barley, fungi control in wheat and potato late blight control, no significant differences were found. This might be seemed remarkable when large differences in <b>spray</b> <b>liquid</b> deposition were found in the potato canopy. One conclusion could be that the penetration ability in dense potato canopies is not of equal importance as to protect the upper parts of the canopy. It is indicated that it could be important to consider other factors, not included in this study, such as the ability to reduce drift and increase capacity, when selecting spray application techniqu...|$|E

40|$|Physically active pesticides, such as mineral oils, {{vegetable}} oils and soaps, {{have been used}} by integrated and organic fruit and berry growers in recent years. The use will most probably increase, as one of several future tools to replace and complete some of the chemical pesti-cides. Physically active pesticides can be effective only if they contact pests thoroughly, un-derlining the importance of high quality application technologies. The objectives of the project are, based on applied research, to produce knowledge of physical active pesticides and of suitable application technology for these, within fruit and berry pro-duction. The effect on the beneficial fauna should be studied as well. Series of experiments were carried out; evaluation of pesticide efficacy in field experiments, determination of application rates, laboratory studies, survey of fauna population, construction of sprayers etc. Variables investigated were dosage, concentration, application rate, and appli-cation method. Most field experiments were conducted at commercial farms. One study shows that a stabile oil <b>spray</b> <b>liquid,</b> without tendencies to separation, was obtained by premixing oil and soap (emulsifier) at a 1 : 1 ratio. Oil spray was applied to control rasp-berry beetle (Byturus tomentosus) in a field experiment. In general, efficacy results were promising, although dosage and application rate were not correlated. The effect on beneficial fauna was not significant while a small difference was noted between treated and control plots. Apple coddling moth (Cydia pomonella) was treated in a pilot study (without replica-tion), showing a limited reduction of the pest. Several evaluations of <b>spray</b> <b>liquid</b> penetration into canopies were made in strawberry, rasp-berry and apple. A fluorescent tracer was added to the <b>spray</b> <b>liquid</b> to quantify deposits. The application quality on sprayed leaves were analysed and visually graded with UV-light. Test results indicated that spray deposit was insufficient at the lower leaf surfaces in the canopy centres, despite of efforts with locating nozzle at different positions, using crop tilters, or in some case using the air assistance. The best deposition result was achieved in apple canopies, probably because air assistance already was used as a standard procedure. Research reports, completed by field and laboratory studies, show that physical active pesti-cides have effects on pests. The effect is however limited, compared to traditional chemical pesticides. This implies a number of high demands within different disciplines; demands that have to be fulfilled to achieve the sufficient effect. Action should only be made against insects with sensitive stages in their life cycle, {{and they have to be}} exposed enough to be targeted by the <b>spray</b> <b>liquid.</b> This requires increased knowledge on behaviours of pests, further developed prognosis/warning systems, and, eventually, repeated spraying with sophisticated application methods.
