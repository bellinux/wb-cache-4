50|$|Surgical technologists are {{individuals}} with specialized education who function {{as members of}} the surgical team in the role of <b>scrub</b> <b>person.</b> With additional education and training, some surgical technologists function in the role of surgical first assistant. Surgical technology programs are inspected by the Accreditation Review Committee on Education in Surgical Technology—a collaborative effort of the Association of Surgical Technologists and the American College of Surgeons, {{under the auspices of the}} Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs. Accredited programs provide both didactic education and supervised clinical experience based on a core curriculum for surgical technology.Accredited programs may be offered in community and junior colleges, vocational and technical schools, the military, universities, and structured hospital programs in surgical technology. The accredited programs vary from nine to 15 months for a diploma or certificate to two years for an associates degree, which is the preferred entry level but not required.Graduates of accredited surgical technology programs are eligible for certification by the National Board of Surgical Technology and Surgical Assisting (NBSTSA), an administratively independent body from the Association of Surgical Technologists consisting of representative Certified Surgical Technologists, a surgeon, and the public.The American College of Surgeons strongly supports adequate education and training of all surgical technologists, supports the accreditation of all surgical technology educational programs, and supports examination for certification of all graduates of accredited surgical technology educational programs.|$|E

40|$|Scrub typhus is {{an acute}} rickettsial {{infectious}} disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, a gram-negative in-tracellular coccobacillus. It is transmitted to humans and other vertebrates through {{the bite of}} the larval trombiculid mites (known as Chiggers) harbouring the etiological agent. The mites normally feed upon single vertebrate hosts, usually rodents. Febrile illness typically begins af-ter the bite of an infected chigger and lasts for 7 – 10 days 1. Headache, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, and an eschar usually develop in the infected <b>person.</b> <b>Scrub</b> typhus have been reported from Southeast Asia, Japan...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Direct {{transmission}} through skin {{contact is}} one of ways for disease transmission. Medical staffs have contact with many patients, so their hand can be a factor for the transmission of disease. Surgical scrub {{is a process that}} leads to destruction immigrant and stable microbus of hands and arms through friction washing by use of antiseptic solution prior to surgery. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effectiveness of disinfection of Povidone-Iodine and Manugel 85 in surgical scrub. METHODS This study was a clinical trial that done before and after Surgical <b>scrub.</b> 33 <b>person</b> of surgical team in hospital were surveyed during. Four samples were done for every person: first before surgical scrub with Povidone-Iodine solution, second immediately after surgical scrub, then after one week third test done before surgical scrub with Manugel 85, and forth one immediately after surgical scrub. Paired t-test was used for statistical analysis and SPSS analysis. RESULTS Data analysis showed that the effect of Povidone-Iodine and Manugel 85, separately, before and after surgical scrub on number of colonies is significant. But the effect of these two solutions on behalf of number of colonies was not significant. The 100...|$|R
40|$|Background: Nowadays, {{new methods}} such as scrub with an {{efficient}} agent for short time are used {{for the prevention of}} communicable diseases and infection control at the most of operating rooms. But, at most of our operating rooms, surgical teams use traditional and routine hand scrub (with Betadine more than 3 min). The aim of this clinical trial was to compare efficacy of Betadine and an alcoholic agent (Decosept) on BCC in Social Security hospital of Khorramabad (west of Iran) in may 2006. Materials and methods: twenty cases were selected from operating room scrub nurses according to inclusion criteria. First, all people washed their hands for 1 minutes with soap. The bacterial colony count was assessed by rubbing their fingertips in Triptyc Soy Broth (TSB) for 1 min. at the next step each <b>person</b> <b>scrubbed</b> their hands with Betadine (Povidone Iodine 7. 5 %) for 3 min and dried them by sterile towel after rinse. Bacterial colony count (immediate effect) was assessed for one hand and the other hand was gloved for 2 hours. After the gloves were taken off, a second colony count was assessed for sustained effect. After one week, all subjects washed their hand and the bacterial colony count was assessed. Then, the hands of each subject scrubbed with Decosept in such a manner that their hands remained wet for 3 min (10 - 12 ml). Data was analyzed by the paired T test. Results: Comparison of BCC Frequency was different for immediate effect of Betadine and Decosept (38 vs. 25), and also for 2 h after scrub (72 vs. 40). The mean of BCC reduction immediately after Betadine and Decosept scrub was significantly different (PV= 0. 011). Also, the mean of BCC increase (sustained effect) 2 h after scrub was different (PV = 0. 023). The BCC mean was increased (1. 7) immediately and 2 hours after scrub with Betadine. But, this increase after scrub with Decosept (second stage) was less than Betadine (1. 15). So, the difference between the first and the second stages, was significant (PV = 0. 001) Conclusion: In general, alcoholic agent (Decosept) was more efficient to reduce BCC. We suggest the alcoholic agent be used more frequently for surgical hand scrub...|$|R
