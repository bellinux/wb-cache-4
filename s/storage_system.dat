In the current decade, the Greek power system will gradually try higher RES penetration, mainly due to wind energy and photovoltaics integration.

This paper examines the ability of the Greek power system to absorb renewable power and the necessity of pumped <b>storage</b> <b>systems.</b> The feasibility of pumped <b>storage</b> <b>systems</b> is discussed in three different scenarios of wind-photovoltaics integration.
