In the current decade, the Greek power system will gradually try higher RES penetration, mainly due to wind energy and photovoltaics integration. Variability of wind and PV generation and the current structure of the Greek power system introduce technical constraints, which should be taken into consideration in the forthcoming large scale RES integration. This paper examines the ability of the Greek power system to absorb renewable power and the necessity of pumped <b>storage</b> <b>systems.</b> The feasibility of pumped <b>storage</b> <b>systems</b> is discussed in three different scenarios of wind-photovoltaics integration.
