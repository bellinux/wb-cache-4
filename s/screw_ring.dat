The specimen is loaded into the bore, possibly using a small <b>screw</b> <b>ring</b> to hold the sample in place. This cartridge is inserted into an airlock with the bore perpendicular to the TEM optic axis. When sealed, the airlock is manipulated to push the cartridge such that the cartridge falls into place, where the bore hole becomes aligned with the beam axis, such that the beam travels down the cartridge bore and into the specimen. Such designs are typically unable to be tilted without blocking the beam path or interfering with the objective lens.|$|E

His method will be easily understood by the annexed sketch. The apparatus is adapted for use on the wooden floors of houses, or ships, by the employment of eyelet-bolts or <b>screw</b> <b>rings</b> instead of pegs, and by putting wooden shoes below the staves to prevent their slipping inwards: the shoes are tied to the eyelet-bolts by a cord.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{configuration}} is a Mason jar {{with a flat}} lid and <b>screw</b> <b>ring.</b> The lid is generally made of plated or painted steel, with an elastomeric washer or gasket bonded to {{the underside of the}} rim. The lid also incorporates a slightly dimpled shape, which acts as an indicator of the vacuum (or lack thereof) inside a sealed jar. A newer reusable lid is now available that uses a flat plastic disk with a reusable rubber gasket. The ring threads onto the top of the jar over the lid to hold it in place while the jar cools after processing; the ring can be removed once a vacuum has been established in the jar. Jars are commonly in either pint or quart capacities, with two opening diameters, known as [...] "standard" [...] and [...] "wide mouth".|$|E

40|$|A {{retrieval}} {{analysis has}} been performed on 50 polyethylene inlays of cementless <b>screw</b> <b>ring</b> implants (Mecring, Mecron, Berlin, Germany) {{to investigate the}} failure mechanism of this specific open cup hip arthroplasty design that has shown a high clinical failure rate. Design-specific damage modes like rim creep, collar fatigue, and backside wear were assessed. Furthermore, the inlays were measured using a CMM to determine deformation. In 90 % backside wear was observed and collar fatigue occurred in 68 % of the cases. Rim creep was present in 38 % of the polyethylene inlays. In 90 % of the cases the cup opening diameter was 32. 1 [*]mm or less and 46 % had a diameter less than 32 [*]mm. It seems that creep and deformation of the polyethylene leads to a reduced diameter at the cup opening and consequently decreased clearance. To avoid this type of failure, polyethylene inlays should be supported at the back by the cup {{to reduce the risk}} of ongoing creep deformation...|$|E
50|$|For the pictured Petri 7 1.8 {{the company}} offered a kit that {{included}} a front adapter lens marked AUX TELEPHOTO which screws onto the primary lens; a similar lens for WIDE ANGLE is in the kit. The kit includes an optical view finder, TELE-WIDE FINDER, which attaches on the flash shoe and contains two optically marked frames showing telephoto and wide angle. This kit works on the Petri 7 1.9 and the Petri 7 1.8 camera. The single primary lens diaphragm works with these adapted lens mounted on the front, a lower cost design than lenses that include all the back glass and diaphragm with each lens. The camera with primary lens is 13 cm wide, 8 cm tall and 7 cm deep, All these lens have 3.5 cm <b>screw</b> <b>rings.</b> Metering {{is powered by a}} ring photocell so no battery is required. Focus is manual on primary lens/viewfinder so the photographer must match the yellow/tinted image with the clear one in the primary viewfinder, then shift the eye to the auxiliary viewfinder to frame the picture when an auxiliary lens is used. 1.8 Camera weighs 710 grams (1 lb 9 oz).|$|R
2500|$|The 30A plug is {{the largest}} of the family.

Plugs and sockets were usually of an industrial waterproof design with a <b>screw</b> locking <b>ring</b> on the plug to hold it in the socket against waterproof seals, and sockets often had a screw cap chained to them to be used when no plug was inserted to keep them waterproof. Use of the BS546 30A plugs and sockets diminished through the 1970s as they were replaced with BS 4343 (which later became IEC 60309) industrial combo plugs and sockets.|$|R
50|$|It may {{be noted}} that due to radial {{movement}} of the legs, plumb bob gets shifted {{in the direction of}} the movement of the leg without seriously affecting the level of the instrument. On the other hand, when the legs are moved side ways or circumferentially, the plumb does not shift much but the level gets affected. Sometimes, the instrument and the tripod have to be moved bodily for centring. It must {{be noted that}} the centering and leveling of instrument is done recursively. Finally, exact centring is done by using the shifting head of the instrument. During this, first the screw-clamping ring of the shifting head is loosened and the upper plate of the shifting head is slid over the lower one until the plumb bob is exactly over the station mark. After the exact centring, the <b>screw</b> clamping <b>ring</b> gets tightened.|$|R
40|$|Different {{types of}} {{prostheses}} and individual patient related characteristics were looked at {{with regard to}} their influence on the survival time of hip implants. 150 changes of total hip endoprostheses due to aseptic loosening were retrospectively analyzed with regard to existing osseous periprosthetic bone defects (DeLee - Gruen. -. Zone classification). The shape of the prostheses, the fixation techniques, the materials of the individual components, the number of revisions as well as sex, weight and age of the patients were taken into account as influential factors and evaluated separately for stems and cups. Results: With regard to the femoral components cemented prostheses had a longer survival time than the cementless implants. Anatomic stems had a higher survival time than straight stems. Five stem types were closer looked at Charnley - Müller Curved Stem - SP II Lubinus, - Müller Straight Stem and ABG. Their respective survival times differ in this study significantly with 17, 2 - 13, 4 - 12, 5 - 10, 5 - and 5, 6 years. With regard to the acetabular components cementless Press-Fit Cups yielded the best results with 12 years survival time, followed by cemented PE-Cups (11 years) and <b>Screwing</b> <b>Rings</b> (10 years). With regard to revisions primary revisions had an average survival time for the femoral components of 12 years and 11 years for the acetabular component. In the case of higher order revisions the survival time varies between 7 to 7, 5 years. The PE-wear was dependent on the wear couple (Metal-PE greater than Ceramic-PE), the cup position and the survival time of the implant (longer than 10 years). Patients with an implantation age of less than 50 years showed a significant occurrence of premature symptomatic loosening. The various types of prostheses showed a different defect distribution pattern in the periprosthetic bone. Conclusions: With regard to the femoral components cementless implants had in average a lower survival time than the cemented ones, whereas {{in the case of the}} acetabular components cementless Press-Fit cups yielded better results than cemented ones. The difference between the various types of prostheses were significant...|$|R

50|$|Starting in the 1930s, filters {{were also}} {{made in a}} sizing system known as a series mount. The filters {{themselves}} were round pieces of glass (or occasionally other materials) with no threads. Very early filters had no rims around the glass, but the more common later production filters had the glass mounted in metal rims. To mount the filters on a camera, the filter was placed between two rings; the mount <b>ring</b> either <b>screwed</b> into the lens threads or was slipped over the lens barrel and the retaining <b>ring</b> <b>screws</b> into the mounting ring to hold the filter in place. The series designations are generally written as Roman numerals, I to IX, though {{there are a few}} sizes not written that way, such as Series 4.5 and Series 5.5. Most Series filter sizes are now obsolete, production having ceased by the late 1970s.

2500|$|The Post Office {{commissioned}} a new design of pillar box in 1980 from {{a panel of}} three competing designers. The competition was won by Tony Gibbs and his design, which {{was thought to be}} ultra-modern at the time, was designated Type K by the Post Office. Made in traditional cast iron, it stayed in production until 2000. Notable features included: replaceable lifting <b>ring</b> <b>screwed</b> into the dome of the box, body and roof of box cast as one piece, large easy-to-read collection time plate, all surface details and collection plate window recessed to give a perfect cylindrical outline, integral restrictor plate, know colloquially as a [...] "Belfast Flap" [...] to restrict posting to letters only and a flanged shallow base suitable for installation in modern buildings, shopping centres and other urban areas. These boxes were thus much easier to move and handle as they could be rolled over level ground or lifted by crane into position. The design had one major flaw {{in the area of the}} door hinge, which is prone to snap under stress and the K type pillar boxes are no longer being installed.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{technical}} feasibility and mechanical properties of 3 locking plate designs (Zero-P, Zero-P VA, and Uniplate 2) {{for use in}} the canine cervical spine. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective ex vivo study. ANIMALS: Cadaver cervical spines from skeletally mature large breed dogs (n[*]=[*] 18). METHODS: Specimens were screened using radiography and allocated into balanced groups based on bone density. Stiffness of intact C 4 -C 5 vertebral motion units was measured in extension, flexion, and lateral bending using nondestructive 4 -point bend testing. Uniplate 2 was then implanted at C 4 -C 5 and mechanical testing was repeated. Mechanical test data were compared against those from 6 spines implanted with monocortical <b>screws,</b> an allograft <b>ring</b> spacer, and PMMA. RESULTS: The Zero-P and Zero-P VA systems could not be surgically implanted due to anatomical constraints in the vertebral column sizes of the canine cervical spines used in this study. Fixation with Uniplate 2 or with screws/PMMA significantly increased stiffness of the C 4 -C 5 vertebral motion units compared to unaltered specimens (P[*]<[*]. 001) in extension. Stiffness of the titanium screw/PMMA fixation was significantly greater than the Uniplate 2 construct in extension. Flexion and lateral bending could not be evaluated in 3 of 6 specimens in the Uniplate 2 group due to failure at the bone/implant interface during extension testing. CONCLUSION: Fixation with Uniplate 2 was biomechanically inferior to screws/PMMA. Particularly concerning was the incidence of vertebral fracture after several testing cycles. Based on our results, Zero-P, Zero-P VA, and Uniplate 2 cannot be recommended for use in dogs requiring cervical fusion. This is the author accepted manuscript.
