40|$|Access {{to finance}} limits {{the ability to}} grow for many early stage ventures. To {{mitigate}} this limitation, the Norwegian State has initiated <b>seed</b> <b>funds</b> partly financed by public funds. The funds carried out many investments during the late 1990 s and 2000 s. This thesis describes and evaluates {{the performance of the}} "second wave" of <b>seed</b> <b>funds</b> established 2006 to 2008. The investments made by the <b>seed</b> <b>funds</b> are compared with investments made by other private equity investors during the same time period. Firstly, the thesis describes the characteristics of companies receiving investments. Secondly, it analyses the development in selected accounting metrics until (and including) 2012. Finally, regression analyses are used to identify the relationship between multiple variables and growth in revenue, operating income and wages. Among these variables is ownership by the second wave of <b>seed</b> <b>funds.</b> The regressions seek to establish a relationship between receiving investments from the <b>seed</b> <b>funds</b> and the subsequent development in revenues, operating income and wages. by Simen Berger Oeby.

The publisher Klaus Saur, of Munich, provided funds, in conjunction with those from the UIA, for work on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions. <b>Seed</b> <b>funding</b> for the third volume of the 4th edition was also provided on behalf of Mankind 2000.

In turn, this proven knowledge management capacity enabled the UIA, on the initiative of Nadia McLaren, a consultant ecologist {{who has been a}} primary editor for the Encyclopedia, to successfully instigate two multi-partner projects funded by the European Union, with matching funds from the UIA. The work done through those two projects, Ecolynx: Information Context for Biodiversity Conservation (mainly) and Interactive Health Ecology Access Links, eventually resulted in what amounted to a fifth, web-based, edition of the Encyclopedia in 2000. In their own ways, two other persons in particular effectively supported the project over the years: Robert Jungk of Mankind 2000, and Christian de Laet of the UIA.|$|E
