50|$|Steel-rule die, {{also known}} as cookie cutter dies, are used for cutting sheet metal and softer webs, such as plastics, wood, cork, felt, fabrics, and paperboard. The cutting surface of the die is the edge of {{hardened}} steel strips, known as <b>steel</b> <b>rule.</b> These steel rules are usually located using saw or laser-cut grooves in plywood. The mating die can be a flat piece of hardwood or steel, a male shape that matches the workpiece profile, or it can have a matching groove that allows the rule to nest into. Rubber strips are wedged in with the <b>steel</b> <b>rule</b> to act as the stripper plate; the rubber compresses on the down-stroke and on the up-stroke it pushes the workpiece out of the die. The main advantage of steel-rule dies is the low cost to make them, as compared to solid dies; however, {{they are not as}} robust as solid dies, so they are usually only used for short production runs.|$|E

40|$|Dreismann, Gray and Blach (DGB) {{have claimed}} that neutron {{scattering}} from molecular hydrogen at energy transfers E sufficiently large to break the H-H bond, gives E ∼ 3 % larger than predicted by conventional quantum theory. DGB presented this claim as the first experimental evidence for energetic consequences of decoherence of quantum entangled particles due to interactions with the environment. It is shown here this claim is entirely spurious. DGB obtained disagreement with conventional theory by changing the geometrical description of the Vesuvio instrument at ISIS, they used to collect their data. Instead of using the default scattering angles obtained from neutron diffraction, DGB used scattering angles obtained using a <b>steel</b> <b>rule</b> and protractor. DGB then manufactured apparent but in fact completely spurious evidence for quantum decoherence effects from the large measurement errors in the scattering angles they used. These give shifts to both higher and lower E than predicted by conventional quantum theory. DGB simply ignored detectors giving shifts to lower values of E. DGB also ignored previously published H 2 data that clearly contradict their claim...|$|E

A fall on stairs, particularly in descent, {{often leads to}} serious injury or even death. The authors {{have been involved in}} the investigation of many workplace stair accidents. Proper forensic investigation into the cause of a stair accident has often found the incident to be wholly or partly caused by poor stair design. In order to establish the relationship between the stair design and a given fall, an onsite survey has to be conducted, determining the rises and goings along with other key dimensions. The Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL), Buxton, UK, regularly undertake this type of survey using a digital inclinometer, a <b>steel</b> <b>rule</b> and a tape measure. Laser scanning is an emerging technique that is now accessible to the surveyor to complement or replace traditional approaches. The laser scanner and associated software produces a dense point survey in 3 D, allowing dimensional analysis of the features. The authors used both traditional and laser scanning techniques to study the scenes of two fatal stair falls. The analysis presented allows the suitability of laser scanning for stair-fall investigation to be considered. Identification and classification of errors are needed in order to consider if the error is acceptable or can be mitigated. Laser scanners are impressive instruments providing data from which can be used to create a virtual 3 D environment that can be used to reconstruct and explain an event and contributing factors. The use of both survey methods currently provides the investigator with complimentary data that allows accurate measurements to be presented in the context of the three-dimensional environment.

The objective was to study the accuracy of these different measurements for predicting carcass composition and possible value, {{in the process of}} carcass grading or classification of ‘Temasco ’ Aragdn lambs. Cold carcass weight (CCW) accounted for 74 % and 40 % of the total variation of muscle weight and total carcass fat weight, respectively. The addition of 4 cm fat depth over the 13 th rib from the left side accounted for a further 13 % of muscle weight, and the addition of 4 cm fat depth over the 5 - 6 th lumbar vertebra from the right side accounted for a further 29 % of the variation of total carcass fat weight. Regarding different fat depots, CCW accounted for 49 % and 31 % of the total variation of the intermuscular fat and kidney and pelvic fat, respectively. However, CCW alone only accounted for 21 % (NS) of the total variation of subcutaneous fat weight, but the addition of 4 cm fat depth over the 13 th rib from the right side or the addition of 4 cm fat depth over the 5 - 6 th lumbar vertebra from the right side accounted for a further 47 % of the subcutaneous fat variation. A comparison of the residual standard deviations (RSD) of the two measurements indicated that the fat depth over the 5 - 6 th lumbar vertebra was more accurate for predicting subcutaneous fat. The highest precision, after CCW, for predicting intermuscular fat, was fat depth over the 13 th rib from th...|$|E
40|$|Painful feet {{caused by}} plantar callosities may affect {{physical}} mobility and, as physical mobility hastens rehabilitation following Total Hip Replacement (THR) surgery painful plantar callosities may detrimentally affect the rehabilitation process. There is, however, no evidence {{at this time}} to suggest that THR recipients are adversely affected by plantar callosities. Indeed, the NAO (2003) report ‘Total Hip Replacement: An Update’ stated that multidisciplinary teams of health professionals should be engaged in the rehabilitation process, but podiatrists were not mentioned. Before any trials can be undertaken with patients following THR, procedures for the mapping for callosities are required. This mapping will assist in the identification of abnormalities before and after THR and subsequently the times for any podiatric intervention. This map consists of four variables: callosity measurements; foot pressure captured from discrete anatomical sites; limb length discrepancy (LLD) and footedness/sidedness (f/s). As this is a new area of investigation, each of the measurement tools used to determine the reliability and usability were piloted. These pilot investigations used a population of twenty male and female participants aged over 40 years without any disabilities. Callosity measurements were determined by tracing thirty callosities and then using planimetry to calculate their surface areas. Thirty footsteps were captured on a foot pressure system and the reliability of the recognition of the first and second metatarsal heads were assessed. Twenty left and right lower limbs were measured using a flexible <b>steel</b> <b>rule</b> from the superior anterior iliac spine to the lateral malleolus. A four task f/s functional characteristic inventory was completed by twenty participants to assess manipulation, mobilisation and stability of the lower limb. The statistical analyses of each of these measurement tools used showed high levels of reliability. Small alterations were made to the measurement systems so making it suitable for any future clinical investigation with THR recipients. This thesis presents the four pilot investigations together with a discussion of the clinical application of this work to THR recipients...|$|E

This paper addresses a dynamic production planning problem for a steel plate fabrication plant with practical flexibility of both customers and manufacturing, such as <b>steel</b> slab-plate matching <b>rules,</b> plate substitution options, production line assignment. These flexibility factors can provide the decision maker with auxiliary options to satisfy customer requirements through realizable production planning. The <b>steel</b> slab-plate matching <b>rules</b> combined with plate substitution options are visualized by a networked graph and formulated by a set based design. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model that incorporates various manufacturing constraints and the flexibility is proposed to simultaneously optimize production strategy and provide practical managerial information such as backlogging/inventory level, capacity availability, and also steel slab demand. Linearization methods are used to transform the original MINLP problem into mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model resulting in easier and quicker solutions.
