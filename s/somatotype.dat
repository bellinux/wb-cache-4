The author defines the pathogenic specifics of development of vegetative dysfunction in adolescents in relation to their morphological status. Cardiointervalography and anthropometric, mathematical and statistical methods of research were used. Based on the results of cardiointervalography, the structure of initial vegetative tonus was established, which was characterized by prevalence of eutonia (38. 4 ± 4. 9 %). The specific weight with background eutonia of adolescent boys and girls tended to be higher among the representatives of the thoracic and muscular <b>somatotypes,</b> compared to adolescents of the alimentive and osseous <b>somatotypes</b> (Р < 0. 001 – 0. 05). The established specifics indicate that thoracic and muscular <b>somatotypes</b> ensure optimal adaptation of organisms to the environment. Sympathicotonia was measured among the majority of boys of extreme constitutional variants (alimentive and osseous <b>somatotypes)</b> (36. 3 % and 30. 0 % respectively), which demonstrates the activation of adaptive mechanisms in the abovementioned category of examined adolescents, while among girls this phenomenon was evident among the representatives of the osseous and thoracic <b>somatotypes</b> (38. 5 % and 30. 8 % respectively). We found that the majority of examined adolescents (53. 4 %) had a normal vegetative reactivity. Gender differences in the structure of vegetative reactivity of adolescents could well be explained by the higher number of girls of asympaticotonic type (19. 2 %) compared to boys (7. 3 %, Р < 0. 05). Furthermore, we found that hypersympathicotonic and asympathicotonic types of vegetative reactivity were characteristic of the majority of representatives of the alimentive and osseous <b>somatotypes</b> irrespective of the gender, which indicates activation of functioning of the cardiovascular system, decreased adaptive capacity of the organism among the examined group.

50|$|Defining a {{particular}} aim for kinanthropometry is central for its full understanding. Ross et al. (1972) said “K is a scientific discipline that studies the body size, the proportionality, {{the performance of}} movement, the body composition and principal functions of the body. This so well cited definition is not completely exact as the last four words show. What are the kinanthropometric methods that truly {{tell us something about}} principal functions of the body? In principle an amount or distribution of fat mass or muscular mass could be correlated or show a level of causation with any disease. The morpho-physiological mechanisms involved in those explanations are big enigmas today. Few diseases are in practice diagnosed using anthropometric measures and body composition methods at any public health care system. The use of body composition outcomes for predicting health status due to their associations with a lot of physiological variables is valid. However, this purpose is not included within the kinanthropometric perspective because the absent of movement prediction's probability in those diagnoses. The countless uses of some of its fundamental methods have to be accepted but they should not change the theoretical core of the scientific discipline. On the other hand, this definition omits some important objectives of quantifying the body that are an indelible part of its frame; for example: the study of human shape using the method of the anthropometric <b>somatotype</b> of Carter and Heath (1990). Besides that, the performance of movement is why one studies the body size, proportionality, body composition, and human shape. It is confusing to write at the same level the performance of movement because then one never clearly portrays the purpose of the discipline, meaning that a descriptive knowledge of the body is the sole purpose while you are mixing the real scope in the statement.|$|E
