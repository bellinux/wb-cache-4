25|$|Some {{researchers}} are now focusing on learning about how adolescents view their own relationships and sexuality; {{they want to}} move away from a research point of view that focuses on the problems associated with adolescent sexuality. College Professor Lucia O'Sullivan and her colleagues found that there were no <b>significant</b> <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in the relationship events adolescent boys and girls from grades 7-12 reported. Most teens said they had kissed their partners, held hands with them, thought of themselves as being a couple and told people they were in a relationship. This means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to the adolescents in the sample. Sexual events (such as sexual touching, sexual intercourse) were less common than romantic events (holding hands) and social events (being with one's partner in a group setting). The researchers state that these results are important because the results focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents and their social and romantic interactions rather than focusing on sexual behavior and its consequences.|$|E

Within [...] Generation Z, there were several important gender differences in sexual identity: young men {{were more likely to}} identify as completely heterosexual than young women (73% v. 59%) whereas young women had higher chances to identify as non-exclusively straight (19%) and bisexual (14%) than young men (10% and 5%, respectively). There were no <b>significant</b> <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in the share identifying as predominantly or exclusively homosexual (5% for each sex), but Generation Z men {{were significantly more likely to}} refuse to disclose their sexual orientation (7%) than their female counterparts (3%). Significantly more white youth identified as exclusively homosexual (3%) than those of ethnic minority backgrounds (0%) but no other ethnic differences were found.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine whether {{the effect of}} {{education}} on mortality for US adults differs by gender. Discrete time logit models were used to analyze a nationally representative dataset (NHANES I) with 12, 036 adults who were 25 - 74 -years-old at the baseline survey in 1971 - 1975, and then re-interviewed three times through 1992. Demographic characteristics, health behaviors and economic status were controlled as potential confounding or mediating factors in the education-mortality relationship. The results showed that education had a comparable effect on mortality for men and women. No statistically <b>significant</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> was found in all-cause mortality, or mortality by cause of death, among younger persons, and among the elderly. Analysis by marital status, however, suggested that these findings apply only to married men and women. Among the divorced, there was a statistically <b>significant</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> whereby education {{had no effect on}} mortality for men while divorced women evidenced a strong education gradient (seven percent lower odds of dying for each year of schooling).

Aim. To assess <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in HRQOL and its associated factors among people living with HIV and on highly active antiretroviral therapy in public health institutions of Mekelle town, Northern Ethiopia. Methods. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 494 adult people living with HIV taking ART services. Quality of life was measured using WHOQOL-HIV BREF. Result. There was a statistically <b>significant</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> (P< 0. 05) in HRQOL among PLHIV on HAART. Females had low score in all HRQOL domains.

Conclusion. There was statistically <b>significant</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in all quality of life domains.

50|$|When {{administered}} to a test population, women {{scored higher on}} fluidity, attitude-behaviour inconsistency, and overall erotic plasticity. There were no <b>significant</b> <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in changes in attitudes, perception of choice and sociocultural influences. The test also did not demonstrate any relationship between erotic plasticity and locus of control, sexual liberality and openness. Benuto also did not find a negative correlation between sex drive and EPQ score, which is unexpected. This is either because of a methodological problem in the scale or a problem in Baumeister’s hypothesis that plasticity is related to sex drive. Furthermore, the subscales of the EPQ did not correlate well with each other, leading Benuto to hypothesize that perhaps there is not just one type of plasticity, but plasticities, and erotic plasticity {{is a much more}} complicated construct than initially imagined.|$|E
50|$|A {{study of}} beliefs about miraculous healing {{among the more}} religiously {{committed}} has indicated that there are significant differences in belief about miraculous healing even among people within the same denomination (Anglican). Researchers found that positive belief in faith healing was mainly a characteristic of conservative Christians, most especially those with charismatic experience. Belief about miraculous healing {{was seen as a}} subset of belief about health and well-being in general. Older people had less belief in miraculous healing or the sovereignty of God over illness, while those with experience of higher education had more inclusive beliefs about miraculous healing and saw human input as less important in the healing process. The study further showed that people with degrees or post-graduate qualifications can and do believe in the possibility of miraculous healing.
