This is to compensate for image distortion caused by atmospheric turbulence and fully take advantage of mirrors with diameters of 30 to 40 m. This requires a more precise characterization of the turbulence. The PML (Profiler of Moon Limb) was developed within this context.

Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) data is normally acquired on single or multiple shells in q-space. The samples in different shells are typically distributed uniformly, because they should be invariant to the orientation of structures within tissue, or the laboratory coordinate frame. The Electrostatic Energy Minimization (EEM) method, originally proposed for single shell {{sampling scheme}} in dMRI by Jones et al., was recently generalized to the multi-shell case, called generalized EEM (GEEM). GEEM has been successfully used in the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Recently, the Spherical Code (SC) concept was proposed to maximize the minimal angle between different samples in single or multiple shells, producing a larger angular separation and better rotational invariance than the GEEM method. In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms based on the SC concept: 1) an efficient incremental constructive method, called Iterative Maximum Overlap Construction (IMOC), to generate a sampling scheme on a discretized sphere; 2) a constrained non-linear optimization (CNLO) method to update a given initial scheme on the continuous sphere. Compared to existing incremental estimation methods, IMOC obtains schemes with much larger <b>separation</b> <b>angles</b> between samples, which {{are very close to}} the best known solutions in single shell case.

40|$|Introduction: In {{the hammer}} throw, a thrower accelerates the hammer by {{performing}} turns across the throwing circle. The speed development during the turns is of high importance as the hammer speed at release {{has the greatest}} influence on distance thrown. In each turn, hammer speed fluctuates with losses occuring during the single support phase and increases during double support [1]. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} throwers should minimise the magnitude of speed losses in single support [1, 2] as once they return to double support they must first account for these losses before they can increase hammer speed once more. In this study the relationship between losses in hammer speed and the thrower's thorax-pelvis <b>separation</b> <b>angle</b> was investigated. It was hoped {{the results of this study}} would give athletes and coaches an indication as to how they could reduce the size of speed losses through manipulation of the thorax-pelvis <b>separation</b> <b>angle.</b> Methods: Five male and five female throwers participated and each was required to perform 10 throws. Retro-reflective markers were positioned on anatomical landmarks of the throwers and on the hammer wire. All three dimensional marker coordinate data were recorded with an infra-red camera system (Oxford Metrics, Oxford, UK). The hammer marker data were used to determine hammer speed [1]. The body marker data were used to create rigid segment models of the thorax and pelvis. The angle between the sagittal axes of these segments was then determined (thorax-pelvis <b>separation</b> <b>angle).</b> For each turn of each participant, the speed loss and thorax-pelvis <b>separation</b> <b>angle</b> magnitude at its smallest were determined. These values were averaged over the participant's ten throws so that each participant had a mean speed loss and minimum angle value for each turn. The relationship between above mentioned variables was examined for the entire group. Pearson's correlation and the associated p-values (p) measured the strength of the relationship. Hierarchical cluster analyses based on a squared Euclidean distance measure were performed to confirm the existence of any outliers [3]. Results and Discussion: Cluster analyses showed that three female participants formed a cluster of their own. Therefore, the correlation measures were computed with these points removed. An additional female participant was grouped in this cluster for turn one and this point was also removed for this turn. Thorax-pelvis <b>separation</b> <b>angle</b> was at its smallest at the end of double support while the speed losses occurred in the subsequent single support phase. The computed correlations (Table 1) indicate that in the second and second last turns, the speed losses during single support were smaller when the thorax-pelvis <b>separation</b> <b>angle</b> was reduced by a greater amount during the preceding double support phase. This is in agreement with coaching literature that suggests thorax-pelvis separation should be approximately zero in the latter stages of double support [2]. The correlations for the first and last turns were not statistically significant. These findings suggest that this cohort of throwers, and those of a similar ability, may be able to reduce speed losses by reducing thorax-pelvis <b>separation</b> <b>angle</b> in double support by a greater amount. It is currently unknown if it is possible for throwers to actively manipulate thorax-pelvis separation. However, the period of double support is when the athlete is at their most stable so it is likely to be when it is easiest for a thrower to manipulate the <b>separation</b> <b>angle.</b> Conclusions: Hammer throwers should aim reduce the thorax-pelvis <b>separation</b> <b>angle</b> by as much as possible during the double support as this may lead to a reduction in hammer speed losses during the subsequent single support phase...|$|E

In 2008, S band same-beam VLBI observations totaling 476 h on 179 days were undertaken. The differential phase delays were successfully estimated for most (about 85 %) of the same-beam VLBI observation periods. The high success rate was mainly due to the continuous data series measuring the differential correlation phase between Rstar and Vstar. The intrinsic measurement error in the differential phase delay was less than 1 mm RMS for small <b>separation</b> <b>angles</b> and increased to approximately 2. 5 mm RMS for the largest <b>separation</b> <b>angles</b> (up to 0. 56 deg).
