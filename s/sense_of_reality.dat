5|$|Within {{his first}} three films, Hard Eight, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, Anderson {{explored}} themes of dysfunctional families, alienation and loneliness. Boogie Nights and Magnolia were noted for their large ensemble casts, which Anderson returned to in Inherent Vice. In Punch-Drunk Love, Anderson explored similar themes but expressed a different visual style, shedding the influences and references of his earlier films, being more surreal and having a heightened <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality.</b> It was also short, compared to his previous two films, at 90 minutes.|$|E

50|$|The long {{distance}} influence of Hørup has been immense. Left liberals and socialists {{as well as}} communists have referred to him and quoted his apothegms regarding him as the ideal unselfish and consequent progressive politician. In return his harsh criticism of national ideals also created many bitter enemies. In fact some parts of Hørup’s person and thoughts are still not fully cleared up. Perhaps his legacy is first of all his wish {{of the creation of}} a political culture based upon regular political differences, upon an equal social evaluation and upon <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>realities.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of material created for previous games, {{such as the}} BLiTZ system and the design of maps, was carried over. Alongside this, improvements {{were made to the}} game's graphics and some elements were expanded, such as map layouts, mission structure, and the number of playable units per mission. A part of this upgrade involved creating unique polygon models for each character's body. In order to achieve this, the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed, as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements. They also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series' gameplay. The newer systems were decided upon early in development. The character designs were done by Raita Honjou, who had worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games. When creating the Nameless Squad, Honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game: the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality, despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> within the Valkyria Chronicles world. The main color of the Nameless was black. As with the previous Valkyria games, Valkyria Chronicles III used the CANVAS graphics engine. The anime opening was produced by Production I.G.|$|E

A questionnaire using the revised scale items was administered to the 67 respondents in a university lecture. Factor analyses revealed that a fairly simple structure corresponding to the three assumed subscales'items was observed. Moreover, Cronbach's coefficients of reliability for three subscales were found all decent. Finally, validity of the scale was examined and confirmed, using respondents'self-reported “seriousness about the situation”, hypothesized {{to relate to the}} <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> Field <b>Reality</b> (SFR).

25|$|He {{retained}} {{to the end}} {{an intense}} love of country, which made him wish to die in Portugal, and in 1796 a royal decree permitting his return there and ordering the restoration of his goods was issued, but delays occurred in its execution, and {{the transfer of the}} court to the Portuguese colony of Brazil {{as a result of the}} French invasion finally dashed his hopes. Before this the Count of Barca had obtained him a commission from the Portuguese government to translate the De Rebus Emanuelis of Jerónimo Osório; the assistance of some fellow-countrymen in Paris carried him through his last years, which were cheered by the friendship of his biographer and translator Alexandre Sane and of the Lusophil Ferdinand Dénis. Lamartine addressed an ode to him; he enjoyed the esteem of Chateaubriand; and his admirers at home, who imitated him extensively, were called after him Os Filintistas. Exile and suffering had enlarged his ideas and given him a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality,</b> making his best poems those he wrote between the ages of seventy and eighty-five, and when he died, it was recognized that Portugal had lost her foremost contemporary poet.|$|E

500|$|Kerekes {{noted the}} animal {{slaughter}} and inclusion of footage from The Last Road to Hell as {{adding to the}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> of the film. Lloyd Kaufman of Troma Entertainment compares these scenes to Vsevolod Pudovkin's theory of montage, saying, [...] "In Cannibal Holocaust, we see the actors kill and rip apart a giant sea turtle and other animals. [...] The brain has been conditioned to accept that which it's now seeing as real. This mixture of real and staged violence, combined with the handheld camerawork and the rough, unedited quality {{of the second half}} of the movie, is certainly enough to convince someone that what they are watching is real." [...] Deodato says he included the execution footage in The Last Road to Hell to draw further similarities to Cannibal Holocaust and the Mondo filmmaking of Gualtiero Jacopetti.|$|E
500|$|Snyder {{wanted the}} songs to add depth, {{dimension}} and [...] "meaning to the sequences they exist within", {{as the film}} includes [...] "multiple levels of reality". de Vries noted the director tried to use songs instead of an original score [...] "so that the lyrics could help navigate {{the way through the}} complex scenes and illuminate Babydoll’s state of mind." [...] Bates said [...] "the songs serve as the link to the conscious world of Babydoll" [...] while the score [...] "was designed to simply underscore the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> in the various alternate realities/action". On the song selection, Snyder said that the tracks were chosen to [...] "resonate" [...] and give the viewer [...] "sort of a nostalgic feeling", and de Vries added that the compositions had to fit the film's [...] "themes of escape and hope, and redemption through the imagination." ...|$|E
500|$|Deodato filmed Cannibal Holocaust {{using the}} cinéma vérité {{technique}} {{he learned from}} his mentor Roberto Rossellini, a style which production designer Massimo Antonello Gelend called [...] "hyperrealistic." [...] Film historian David Kerekes contends that the film's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> {{is based on the}} direction and the treatment of the film team's recovered footage, noting that the [...] "shaky hand-held camerawork commands a certain realism, and 'The Green Inferno,' the ill-fated team's film-within-a-film here, is no exception," [...] and that [...] "this very instability gives the 'Green Inferno' film its authentic quality." [...] David Carter of the cult horror webzine Savage Cinema says that Deodato's methods added a first-person quality to the film team's footage, claiming, [...] "The viewer feels as if they are there with the crew, experiencing the horrors with them." [...] Deodato was proud of other aspects of the cinematography, namely the numerous moving shots using a standard, shoulder-mounted camera, foregoing the use of a steadicam.|$|E

500|$|Doll has {{received}} several positive reviews from English-language critics. About.com's Deb Aoki {{placed it on}} her list of recommended horror manga. According to Aoki, Mihara's stories proved to be haunting, despite not following the traditional model of gory horror stories. While finding Mihara's art well-done, yet [...] "not especially memorable", Patrick King of Animefringe wrote that Mihara's focus on the social effects of the Dolls and their environments greatly contributed to {{the appeal of the}} series. Sequential Tarts Sheena McNeil wrote that Doll examines the relationships between androids and people on [...] "a much more serious and realistic level" [...] than Clamp's Chobits. In follow-up reviews, she wrote that the series conveyed [...] "a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> that is unsettling and the stories are harsh reads—being violent and/or tragic." [...] According to her, Doll simultaneously examines the meaning of humanity and modern-day fears surrounding the possibility of such androids. She also wrote that Mihara's [...] "jaw-dropping beautiful" [...] artwork contrasted well with the characters' misery. Jason Thompson, in , wrote that childbirth and family served as the manga's themes. According to him, Mihara's character designs and artwork complemented the stories nicely. Conversely, Anime News Network's Liann Cooper reviewed the hardcover edition of Doll with mixed feelings: according to her, the stories mostly lacked entertainment value, and had artwork that failed to catch the reader's eye, but she praised the presentation. She concluded that the hardcover edition would only appeal to [...] "avid collectors".|$|E
500|$|As Netflix {{does not}} reveal {{subscriber}} viewership numbers {{for any of}} their original series, Symphony Technology Group compiled data for the season based on a sample size of 15,000 people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, from September to December 2015, episodes of Jessica Jones averaged 4.8 million viewers during a 35-day viewing cycle. The data was presented by Alan Wurtzel, NBCUniversal president of research and media development, in a presentation aimed to provide [...] "perspective" [...] when stating [...] "digital platforms are hurting the traditional TV business". Netflix CCO Ted Sarandos responded to the data by saying that [...] "the whole methodology and the measurement and the data itself doesn’t reflect any <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> of anything that we keep track of." [...] A further study from Symphony, for the same time period, found Jessica Jones {{to be one of}} the four most watched series in the 18 to 24 demographic, ahead of any broadcast network series. The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the fifth-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 26% of the viewers that the second season of Daredevil received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. Jumpshot, which [...] "analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company’s U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.|$|E

The episode received generally positive reviews. Marc Hirsh of National Public Radio said {{the addition of the}} no-nonsense Charles Miner character infused a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> into The Office, which he said was growing increasingly wacky and out of control: [...] " [...] may, in fact, {{have been one of the}} most important episodes of the entire series, acting as a corrective to the show's increasing flirtations with ridiculousness. The characters of The Office have lived in a bubble for long enough." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said [...] "New Boss" [...] brought a badly needed change to the series, which he said had been in a [...] "stagnant state" [...] over the last several episodes. Fickett said Steve Carell gave [...] "a tour de force" [...] as Michael saw his power slip away, and he called the final scene when Michael quit as one of the show's biggest moments. He said, [...] "Watching Miner work like a monkey wrench thrown into the works is the most fun I've had watching this show in a long time." [...] Shahzad Abbas of TV Guide said, [...] "Overall, this was a terrific episode, tightly structured, some nice laugh-out loud moments, and a genuine shocker at the end that was completely consistent with Michael's personality." ...|$|E
