The statue of Tua Pek Kong deity was specially sculptured and imported from Xiamen, China. After the building was completed, the list of donors and details of expenditure were recorded in two pieces of stone tablet which are still well preserved in the temple.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{distribution}} of the <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> in outwash deposits, the paper present a modeling method for the random structure of outwash deposits, in which the long axis of the <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> is supposed obeying a lognormal distribution. Then numerical experiments of biaxial compression using the granular discrete element method are used in the macro- and micro parametric analysis. The influences of strength of the cementation, the sizes of <b>stone</b> <b>blocks,</b> and the content of <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> on the peak compressive and shear strength are discussed. The micromechanical parameters of the outwash deposits are also analyzed. The proposed method offers a supplement to the mechanical characterization of outwash deposits and accounts for the limitation that indoor experiments cannot consider large <b>stone</b> <b>blocks...</b>|$|R

50|$|Approximately 4,000 of the {{original}} stones and carvings from the temple are stored in this museum. These include some dissasembled <b>stone</b> <b>blocks,</b> decorative panels, parts of reliefs and structures are stored {{in the open air}} field within museum compound. These <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> could not be included within Borobudur structure because of missing connecting parts. Borobudur structures are interlocking <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> and sometimes replacement new stones are added to replace the missing ones. Some of the important <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> displayed here are the chattra, the triple-tiered stone umbrellas served as the pinnacle of Borobudur main stupa. The chattra was reconstructed by Theodoor Van Erp during restoration project between 1907 and 1911. Although the chattra was carefully reconstructed, there was too few remains of {{the original}} stone pinnacle. Since the pinnacle design was considered only based upon estimation, Van Erp finally decided to dismantled the chattra pinnacle, now displayed in this museum.|$|R
