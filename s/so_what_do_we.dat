5000|$|There is {{a related}} {{distinction}} very closely {{connected with the}} type-token distinction. This distinction is the distinction between an object, or type of object, and an occurrence of it. In this sense, an occurrence {{is not necessarily a}} token. Considering the sentence: [...] "A rose is a rose is a rose". We may equally correctly state that there are eight or three words in the sentence. There are, in fact, three word types in the sentence: [...] "rose", [...] "is" [...] and [...] "a". There are eight word tokens in a token copy of the line. The line itself is a type. There are not eight word types in the line. It contains (as stated) only the three word types, 'a', 'is' and 'rose', each of which is unique. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> call what there are eight of? They are occurrences of words. There are three occurrences of the word type 'a', two of 'is' and three of 'rose'.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{the long}} hours working in the studio, Neill, Auerbach, and Carney {{generally}} only had time to kill at night when fewer retailers are open. Furthermore, Sheffield was remote and isolated; Neill said, [...] "What they were complaining about is that at night, after <b>we</b> were <b>done,</b> {{they wanted to go}} swarm around and do something. There's nothing. I told them that before we went out. Unless you want to go see a movie or something, or go to Walmart and stand around under the fluorescent lights. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> <b>We</b> went to Walmart." [...] Carney said that the trio were [...] "just so bored that we were getting so fucked up every night at the hotel," [...] and one drunken night the group stayed up watching YouTube clips of Freddie King. The following day, the musicians showed up at the studio and found a harpsichord. The band's manager had received a drunken voicemail from the band the night before asking for a harpsichord. The trio soon grew restless for a change, and after finalizing the tenth and final song at Muscle Shoals, the band left town. Back in La Mesa, Neill tweaked the multitracks, then filed the recordings away and awaited further instruction. The Black Keys eventually decided to re-work the overtly swampy tracks from Muscle Shoals using more modern machinery, and they subsequently employed producer Tchad Blake to re-mix their songs.|$|R

The receivers were in the trade, and kept capital shops - establishments of the first respectability - one of 'em at the West End, one down in Westminster. After a lot of watching and inquiry, and this and that among ourselves, we found that the job was managed, and the purchases of the stolen goods made, at a little public-house near Smithfield, down by Saint Bartholomew's; where the Warehouse Porters, who were the thieves, took 'em for that purpose, don't you see? and made appointments to meet the people that went between themselves and the receivers. This public-house was principally used by journeymen butchers from the country, out of place, and in want of situations; <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> but - ha, ha, ha! - we agreed that I should be dressed up like a butcher myself, and go and live there!' ...|$|R

According to the greatest critic of privacy theory, Judith Thomson, {{there is no such}} thing as a fundamental right to privacy. Violations of privacy can be dealt with without reference to the right to privacy, she claims. This thesis provides arguments against her short-sided view on privacy, including arguments from William Parent. He advocates a minimalist conception of the right to privacy, centered around the notion of personal information. The modern conception of privacy, formulated in this thesis, continues on the work of Thomson and Parent, thereby refining some elements of Parent’s theory of informational privacy...|$|E
