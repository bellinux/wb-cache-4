5|$|Angel's Bakery {{opened its}} {{landmark}} factory store {{adjacent to the}} Givat Shaul plant in 1984. The store offers a full selection of packaged breads, rolls, and muffins, bourekas, danishes, fancy cakes, handmade pastries, coffee and soft drinks. For many years, visitors could watch bakers braid challahs through a large <b>side</b> <b>window.</b> At {{the end of the}} Passover holiday, a long line of customers traditionally forms outside the store after midnight, waiting to buy the first bread off the production line.|$|E
5|$|The {{engine and}} {{propeller}} had automatic controls, and an auto-trimmer made the aircraft tail-heavy as the pilot rolled over into his dive, lining up red lines at 60°, 75° or 80° on the cockpit <b>side</b> <b>window</b> with {{the horizon and}} aiming at the target with {{the sight of the}} fixed gun. The heavy bomb was swung down clear of the propeller on crutches prior to release.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Slavoj Hašek was awoken by commotion {{from outside}} of his house. Hašek left his house with a shotgun and pursued a thief. After the thief got to his own car and drove it in Hašek's direction, he shot and killed him. Hašek was sentenced to five years {{imprisonment}} with the High Court in Olomouc arguing that the defense could not be legitimate, since the shot went through a <b>side</b> <b>window</b> rather than through the front windshield. Hašek was pardoned by President Klaus shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the <b>side</b> <b>window.</b> Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
25|$|The T200 {{sedan and}} five-door {{hatchback}} featured a swage line {{running along the}} lower body to the rear door, which kinks downward prominently on the five-door. Five-doors also feature a <b>side</b> <b>window</b> in the C/D pillar with a distinctively angled lower edge. Interiors feature a circular motif throughout.|$|E
25|$|The bubble top on the KR200 was {{simplified}} {{over that}} of the KR175 {{by the use of}} a larger curved glass windshield that formed A-pillars with the <b>side</b> <b>window</b> frames. This allowed the bubble to be simpler and more compact than the KR175 bubble, and it was consequently easier and less expensive to produce. The windshield wiper, manual on the KR175, was electric on the KR200.|$|E

25|$|In 1957, the KR200 Kabrio {{model was}} released, {{featuring}} a cloth convertible top and fixed <b>side</b> <b>window</b> frames. This {{was followed by}} the KR201 Roadster without window frames, using a folding cloth top, a windscreen, and removable side curtains. A Sport Roadster was later offered with no top and with the canopy fixed into place so that the driver would have to climb in and out {{at the top of the}} car.|$|E
25|$|The March 30, 1861, {{issue of}} Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper {{contains}} a detailed {{sketch of the}} hospital interior. There appears {{to be at least}} eight hospital beds and two operating tables. Access was gained by a steeply-angled staircase through a hatch in the roof. A framed wooden door allowed for entry and exit on the starboard side of the hospital closer to the waterline while two framed glass sash windows allowed in light on the port <b>side.</b> <b>Window</b> casements framed into the roof allowed for some additional light and ventilation.|$|E

25|$|The east window {{has been}} {{restored}} with glass from 1887. There are two windows in the north wall of the chancel; the eastern is mid-14th-century but the western is earlier, from the 13th century. The south wall has two windows, the eastern corresponding to {{the window in the}} north wall. The other is a low <b>side</b> <b>window</b> of the late 13th century or early 14th century with one pointed light, set in a wide 14th-century recess. This window was probably unglazed with a wooden shutter and may have been used as a sanctus window through which the sanctus bell was rung at the Elevation of the host.|$|E
25|$|Earnhardt had the {{dominant}} {{car of the}} race, leading 115 out of 160 laps. On the last restart, he managed {{to make a move}} from sixth to first place in the span of two laps, with Waltrip holding off the field as Earnhardt took the checkered flag. He won the MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400 at Dover, which was the first Cup race following the September 11 attacks as the original scheduled race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway was postponed {{until the end of the}} season. After the race, he performed a Polish victory lap while holding a large American flag out the driver's <b>side</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to European failures, the domestic league form was satisfactory with Bajević leading {{the team to}} top of the league with 14 points in spare at the winter break. However, {{the second part of}} the season began with an inexplicable dip in form. The slide continued and on 24 February 2007 Red Star lost 4–2 to eternal rivals FK Partizan. A few days later on 27 February 2007, angry fans made damage to Bajević's club-issued Toyota SUV by slaming a brick through its <b>side</b> <b>window</b> while the car was parked at the Markana stadium parking lot during Bajević's guest appearance on SOS kanal TV station.|$|E
5000|$|In 1964, {{with the}} launch of the Super Minx Mark III the Super Minx was facelifted, and the {{wrap-around}} rear window gave way to a new [...] "six-light" [...] design with extra <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> aft of the rear side doors. The windscreen and <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> were also made taller and the roofline flatter.|$|R
40|$|The Australasian Branch of the International Window Film Association has {{lobbied for}} {{approval}} for tinting of front <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> of cars {{down to a}} level such that 35 % of incident visible light is transmitted through to the driver. South Australia currently has a minimum level of visible light transmittance of 70 % for front <b>side</b> <b>windows.</b> This Report explores the safety implications of the proposed greater levels of tinting on front <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> and concludes that road safety would be adversely affected by allowing such a move.

25|$|As a {{preliminary}} step towards the AC-47 Spooky gunship program (retroactively Gunship I), under Project Tailchaser C-131B Samaritan, 53-7820, {{was given a}} gunsight for the <b>side</b> <b>window,</b> but instead of guns it had cameras in the cargo area. In 1964 the C-131 was ferried to Eglin AFB and a General Electric SUU-11A/A 7.62mm Gatling-style Minigun was installed. Live ammunition was used and both over-water and over-land tests in late summer were successful. A C-47 was subsequently fitted with three Miniguns and side-firing tests began in September 1964. The initial combat operation of the FC-47, as it was initially officially named, began in Vietnam on 15 December 1964.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 the car gained {{rear light}} units from the Citroën Ami 6, and also {{standardised}} a third <b>side</b> <b>window</b> {{in the rear}} pillar on 2CV6 (602cc) models. From 1970, only two series were produced: the 2CV 4 (AZKB) with 435 cc and the 2CV 6 (Azka) with 602 cc displacement. All 2CVs from this date can run on unleaded fuel. 1970s cars featured rectangular headlights, except the Spécial model. In 1971 the front bench seat was replaced with two individual seats. In 1972 2CVs were fitted with standard three-point seat belts. In 1973 new seat covers, a padded single-spoke steering wheel and ashtrays were introduced.|$|E

25|$|At 1:08p.m. PDT, {{approximately}} {{seven hours}} after the rapes, Mixon's burgundy 1995 Buick sedan was pulled over by two motorcycle officers, Officer John Hege and Sergeant Mark Dunakin, for a traffic violation, in the 7400 block of MacArthur Boulevard in East Oakland, one block away from Eastmont Town Center and an Oakland Police Department substation. After collecting Mixon's driver's license, Sergeant Dunakin became suspicious that the license was fake and signaled to his partner, Officer Hege, to arrest Mixon. Mixon accessed a semiautomatic pistol, leaned out of the vehicle's <b>side</b> <b>window,</b> and opened fire without warning, methodically shooting both officers twice. After the officers collapsed to the ground, {{he got out of}} the vehicle, approached them, and fired execution-style directly into their backs. He then briefly remained standing over the bodies before fleeing on foot. Those who heard the gunshots reported Mixon as having fired six shots. Neither officer was able to return fire. Mixon was last seen fleeing westward into the surrounding neighborhood on 74th Avenue southbound.|$|E
25|$|At Florence and Halldale, two {{officers}} issued {{a plea for}} assistance in apprehending a young suspect who had thrown an object at their car and whom they were now pursuing on foot. Approximately two dozen officers, commanded by 77th Street Division LAPD officer Lieutenant Michael Moulin, arrived and arrested the youth, 16-year old Seandel Daniels, forcing him {{into the back of}} a car. The rough handling of the young man, a minor who was well known in the community, further agitated an uneasy and growing crowd, who began taunting and berating the police. Among them was Bart Bartholemew (who was later attacked and had his driver <b>side</b> <b>window</b> broken), a freelance photographer for The New York Times, and Timothy Goldman, who began to record events with a camcorder over the next two hours. The police formed a perimeter around the arresting officers as the crowd grew more hostile, leading to further altercations and arrests (including that of Damian Williams' older brother, Mark Jackson). Fearing police would resort to deadly force to repel the growing crowd, Lieutenant Moulin ordered officers out of the area altogether. Moulin later said that officers on the scene were outnumbered and unprepared to handle the situation because their riot equipment was stored at the police academy.|$|E
500|$|In 1999 Peter Hughes, Holden's {{manager of}} {{exterior}} design, produced a two-dimensional {{image of a}} sketch drawn earlier by Michael Simcoe, Holden's design director at the time. Known in house as the [...] "Bill of Design", the sketch formed the design basis for the production-ready car. Various elements of the sketch were changed, including the rear tail lamps, the low-profile <b>side</b> <b>window</b> cluster and the drawn out wheelbase, but the aggressive stance remained.|$|E
