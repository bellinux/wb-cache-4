During this time they employed some of the following companies to overprint or print the stamps: Dollard, Thom, Irish Government Printers, Waterlow and Sons (London), De La Rue and Co., Bradbury Wilkinson and Co., Ltd., (London), Harrison and Sons Ltd., (London) and Irish Security <b>Stamp</b> <b>Printing</b> Ltd.|$|E

25|$|Eighteen {{values from}} 1p to £5 {{made up the}} initial set. All values, except the £1 and £5 (being nearly double size at 24mm x 45mm) that were printed in sheets of 50, were all sheets of 100 by ISSP, Irish Stamp Security <b>Stamp</b> <b>Printing</b> Ltd. On 2 February 1999, a {{miniature}} sheet of fifteen different 30p birds stamps debuted using many of the original birds except that new designs {{were used for the}} peregrine falcon, wren and pied wagtail.|$|E
25|$|The job of {{designing}} and printing the new stamp {{was carried out}} in a great rush; engraving began only on May 4, and <b>stamp</b> <b>printing</b> on May 10 (a Friday), in sheets of 100 (contrary to the usual practice of printing 400 at a time and cutting into 100-stamp panes). Since the stamp was printed in two colors, each sheet had to be placed into the flat-bed printing press twice, an error-prone process that had resulted in invert errors in stamps of 1869 and 1901, and at least three misprinted sheets were found during the production process and destroyed. It is believed that only one misprinted sheet of 100 stamps got through unnoticed, and stamp collectors have spent the ensuing years trying to find them all.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, several {{ingredients}} of postage stamp ink {{that had previously}} been imported from Germany became unavailable, and the domestic materials that replaced them had significant gritty impurities, with the result that the <b>stamp</b> <b>printing</b> plates became worn much more quickly. In response to this problem, the U.S. Post Office employed the new offset printing process to produce several separate Washington-head issues. The offset method involved taking a photo of a die proof of the postage stamp and through a special process, transferring an image of its negative to a plate of glass, which became the actual printing plate. The set-up and development process was more involved in the preparation stages than the engraving process, but once the photo mask was made it only took about an hour to produce and replace a worn printing plate. The offset process produced an image of lesser quality with a smooth surface, as compared to that of an engraved stamp whose lines are raised above the surface of the paper. A stamp produced by the offset process almost always possesses a softer or grayish tone to its color and is usually easy to distinguish, especially when placed next to a similar stamp printed by the engraving process.|$|E

2500|$|The Washington Bicentennial {{issues of}} 1932 {{are the first}} {{commemorative}} postage stamps ever issued by the Post Office that honor and depict George Washington by himself, and not {{in conjunction with other}} people, places, or events {{as is the case with}} the [...] with Washington's image issued before 1932.

2500|$|The [...] "Inverted Jenny" [...] (C-3a) is a 24-cent 1918 US Air Mail postage <b>stamp</b> <b>printing</b> {{error in}} which the blue central {{vignette}} of US Army Curtiss JN-4HM #38262, the nation's first mailplane, appeared as [...] "inverted" [...] on a single sheet of 100 stamps owing to an inadvertent error made by the operator of a hand-rolled spider press by printing the blue vignette impressions upside down after the red frames had previously been printed on the sheet. As the Jenny vignette was only inverted on one sheet, this stamp represents the rarest and most valuable known USPOD printing error of all time. A single example (sheet position 57) sold at auction in 2007 for $977,500.00.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the image}} was being {{prepared}} for exhibit in 1941, the negative of the photo was retouched to remove Florence's thumb from the lower-right corner of the image. In the late 1960s, Bill Hendrie found the original Migrant Mother photograph along with 31 other unretouched, vintage photos by Dorothea Lange in a dumpster at the San Jose Chamber of Commerce. After the death of Hendrie and his wife, their daughter, Marian Tankersley, rediscovered the photos while emptying her parents' San Jose home. In 1998, the retouched photo of Migrant Mother became a 32-cent U.S. Postal Service stamp in the 1930s portion of the Celebrate the Century series. The <b>stamp</b> <b>printing</b> was unusual since daughters Katherine McIntosh (on the left in the stamp) and Norma Rydlewski (in Thompson's arms in the stamp) were alive {{at the time of}} the printing and [...] "It is very uncommon for the Postal Service to print stamps of individuals who have not been dead for at least 10 years." ...|$|E
