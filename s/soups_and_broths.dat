40|$|O trabalho avaliou a aceitação de caldos e canjas elaborados com farinhas aromatizadas desenvolvidas a partir de carcaças de peixes defumadas. As carcaças de tilápia do Nilo, carpa e pacu foram lavadas, identificadas, pesadas, imersas em salmoura com ervas aromáticas e defumadas. O produto defumado foi submetido à moagem para obtenção das farinhas, a partir das quais foram elaborados o caldo e a canja. Porções das farinhas, dos caldos e das canjas foram avaliadas por um painel de 40 provadores utilizando-se um método de estímulo simples, sendo avaliados os atributos: aroma, sabor, cor, textura, aparência e aceitação geral. Não houve diferença significativa (P > 0, 05) na aceitação geral dos produtos. Os caldos elaborados com estas farinhas tiveram uma {{excelente}} aceitação, não diferindo significativamente entre si no que se refere aos atributos avaliados. A canja elaborada a partir da farinha de carcaça de pacu apresentou as menores notas quando comparada às demais canjas. Portanto, as farinhas aromatizadas podem ser empregadas no enriquecimento de produtos para o consumo humano. Esses produtos podem ser aplicados na merenda escolar, melhorando a qualidade nutricional das refeições. Além disso, tal uso daria um destino nobre aos resíduos que podem causar sérios impactos se descartados no meio ambiente. This work {{evaluated the}} acceptance of <b>soups</b> <b>and</b> <b>broths</b> prepared with aromatized meals made from smoked fish carcasses. The species of fish used for smoking were Nile Tilapia, carp, and pacu. The carcasses were washed, labeled, weighted, immersed in a solution of brine with aromatic herbs, and smoked. The smoked product was crushed to obtain the meal, which was used to cook the soups and the broths. Portions of meals, broths and soups were sampled by 40 tasters based on a simple stimulus method, which evaluated characteristics such as aroma, flavor, color, texture, aspect, and general acceptance. Considering the three species of fish used to prepare the meals, there were not significant differences (P > 0, 05) in the products general acceptance. Soups made with these meals had an excellent acceptance, and so no notable differences in the evaluated attributes were found. The broth made with pacu carcass meal was rated the lowest comparing to the other broths. Therefore, aromatized meals {{can be used to}} supplement products destined to human consumption. They can be also used to supplement school meals improving the nutritional quality of children's meal. Such utilization would give a noble destination to residues, which can cause serious impacts if discarded in the environment...|$|E

Issues such as training staff to serve and weigh portions were well understood. [...] The diets included general guidance, as well as schedules for each class of inmate.

For instance, a breakfast of bread and gruel was followed by dinner, which might consist of cooked meats, pickled pork or bacon with vegetables, potatoes, yeast dumpling, <b>soup</b> <b>and</b> suet, or rice pudding.

50|$|When first {{returning}} home after surgery, a nutritional diet {{is necessary in}} order to keep the body operating correctly. Junk food is not a good idea, as the grease and sugar can irregulate the bowels. Fruit, vegetables, and juices will be a vital part in the diet. Food and drink will be limited for the patient after surgery. Because the bowels are not fully active because of anesthetic, clear water and ice may be the only acceptable thing to ingest. After the digestive tract is back up to speed, soft food and drink like pudding, <b>soup</b> <b>broth,</b> <b>and</b> orange juice are acceptable. Very dark urine with a strong odor means that the person is most likely dehydrated and needs more fluids. In order for the urine to become a pale or clear color, the patient will need to drink a lot of water. Juices such as prune juice are a healthy option and prune juice also helps with constipation, a common factor after surgery. When it comes to food, whole grains should be added into the diet. Whole grains can be broken down easily by the body whereas processed grains and flour cannot be broken down easily. Processed grains and flour also add to constipation.|$|R
