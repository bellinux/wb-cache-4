Although politically successful, John fell into hard times financially and was forced to eventually sell much of the enormous library collection in 1892 to Enriqueta Rylands, who was building the University of Manchester Library. After dying childless in 1910, John passed Althorp to his half brother, Charles <b>Spencer,</b> 6th Earl <b>Spencer,</b> who served as Lord Chamberlain from 1905 to 1912 in the Liberal administrations headed by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H.

5|$|Roberts {{announced}} that the 1983 season would be his final year in Grand Prix competition. Yamaha team manager Giacomo Agostini {{had been unable to}} agree on a contract with rider Graeme Crosby, so AMA Superbike champion Eddie Lawson was brought in as Roberts' new teammate. The 1983 battle for the championship between Roberts and Honda's <b>Spencer</b> would be considered one of the greatest seasons in motorcycle Grand Prix history, along with the 1967 500cc duel between Mike Hailwood and Giacomo Agostini. Roberts began the season with his YZR500 having problems with overheating and rear suspension, while <b>Spencer</b> started strongly, winning the first three races and five out of the first seven. Roberts was leading the second race in France, when his Yamaha split an expansion chamber causing it to lose power as <b>Spencer</b> won, with Roberts falling to fourth place. In Round 3 at Monza, Roberts crashed while leading <b>Spencer</b> three laps from the finish. Roberts came back to win the German Grand Prix, but then finished second to <b>Spencer</b> in Spain in a race <b>Spencer</b> called one of the toughest of his career. Things began to go Roberts' way at the Austrian Grand Prix as Roberts won while Spencer's Honda suffered a crankshaft failure. In the Yugoslavian Grand Prix, Roberts' Yamaha failed to start immediately, while <b>Spencer</b> charged to an early lead, leaving Roberts to fight through the field to finish in fourth place. Roberts then went on a three-race winning streak with victories in the Netherlands, Belgium and England, while <b>Spencer</b> stayed close with a third place and two second-place finishes.|$|E

5|$|The {{championship}} {{then moved}} to the penultimate round at the Swedish Grand Prix with <b>Spencer</b> holding a two-point lead over Roberts. Roberts led <b>Spencer</b> going into the last lap of the race. Heading down the back straight, <b>Spencer</b> placed his Honda right behind Roberts' Yamaha {{as they reached the}} second to the last corner, a ninety degree right-hander. As both riders applied their brakes, <b>Spencer</b> came out of Roberts' slipstream and managed to get inside of the Yamaha. As they exited the corner, both riders ran wide off the track and into the dirt. <b>Spencer</b> was able {{to get back on the}} track and back on the power first, crossing the finish line just ahead of Roberts for a crucial victory. Roberts considered Spencer's pass to be foolish and dangerous, and exchanged angry words with him on the podium. Roberts would have to win the final round at the San Marino Grand Prix with <b>Spencer</b> finishing no better than third place in order for Roberts to win his fourth world championship. In a fitting end to a great career, Roberts won his last-ever Grand Prix race, however <b>Spencer</b> was able to secure second place to claim the world championship. The two riders dominated the season with each claiming six victories in the 12 race series.|$|E
5|$|When John <b>Spencer</b> died in 1522, {{he passed}} the estate to his {{youngest}} son, Sir William <b>Spencer,</b> High Sheriff of Northamptonshire, who held it {{until his death in}} 1532. Only a boy at the time of William's death, his son John <b>Spencer</b> inherited Althorp and held it until his death in 1586, when he passed it to his son, also John, who died in 1600. John's son, Robert, was created the 1st Baron <b>Spencer</b> of Wormleighton on 21 July 1603. King Charles I is documented to have visited Althorp during his reign. The drawing room was built and the main hall enlarged for the occasion, with £1,300 spent on the banquet, an exorbitant sum for the period. Upon Robert Spencer's death in 1627 Althorp devolved to William <b>Spencer,</b> 2nd Baron <b>Spencer</b> of Wormleighton who held it until his death in 1636. William's eldest son, Henry <b>Spencer,</b> 1st Earl of Sunderland, known as The Lord <b>Spencer</b> between 1636 and June 1643, fought in the Battle of Edgehill in 1642 and was rewarded for his services on 8 June 1643 when the title of Earl of Sunderland was bestowed upon him, although the title cost him £3,000. He then fought in the Siege of Gloucester in August 1643 and the First Battle of Newbury on 20 September 1643, where he was killed, aged 23, by a cannonball.|$|E
