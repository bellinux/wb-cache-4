The baseline activity of the device was not measured and the overall hit rate was not reported by Osis. According to Blackmore when she calculated the hit rate from the data [...] "overall the subject made no more hits than would be expected by chance. This implies that any hits made were likely to have been due to chance and not an OBE.

40|$|Objective: Investigate {{whether the}} gut {{feelings}} of one person, as measured with an electrogastrogram (EGG), {{respond to the}} emotions of a distant person. Design: In a double blind protocol, EGG activity was recorded in an individual relaxing in a heavily <b>shielded</b> <b>chamber</b> while, at a distance, a second person periodically viewed the live video image of the first person along with stimuli designed to evoke positive, negative, calming, or neutral emotions. Subjects: Twenty-six (26) pairs of healthy adult volunteers. Outcome measures: EGG maximum values recorded while the distant person was exposed to emotional stimuli were compared to similar values recorded during exposure to neutral stimuli. Results: EGG maximums were significantly larger on average when the distant person was experiencing positive (p 0. 006) and negative (p 0. 0009) emotions, as compared to neutral emotions. Nonparametric bootstrap procedures were employed to evaluate these differences, and the results survive correction for mul-tiple analyses. Conclusions: EGG activity increases {{in response to the}} emotions of a distant person, beyond the influence of ordinary sensory interactions.

In order to free the testers out of the <b>shielded</b> <b>chamber,</b> allow both the developers and the testers to use the test systems remotely and maximize the expensive test system usage. An automated test framework is highly demanded. In this thesis, the design of the automated test framework is introduced. There are four main components in the test framework.

Further, the evaluation of the scheduler is conducted based on the queueing theory. Based on the simulation result, a good scheduling algorithm is proposed.

With the present CGE, a few grams of {sup 239 }Pu could be distinguished above background in light matrix samples. It is controlled by a personal computer that uses a menu driven operating program. The {{program is designed to}} reduce the potential for operator error while obtaining a fissile material gram estimate of a line generated waste package prior to placement in a drum. This report describes the work performed to characterize the counting chamber for fissile material estimation. The operating features of the CGE, the results and conclusions drawn from the experiments, and the future work recommended for the next generation CGEs are also described.

40|$|Objective: To explore {{effects of}} healing {{intention}} and intentional space conditioning {{on the growth}} of cul-tured human brain cells {{and the distribution of}} truly random events. Design: The experiment took place inside an electromagnetically and acoustically <b>shielded</b> <b>chamber</b> over a period of 3 days. On each day randomly selected flasks of human astrocytes in culture were exposed to heal-ing treatments; an equal number of unexposed flasks served as controls. Intentional healing and space-condi-tioning meditations were repeatedly held inside the chamber {{over the course of the}} experiment to see if this ac-tivity would cumulatively enhance the efficacy of healing treatments. To monitor the environment for negentropic effects possibly associated with healing intention, three truly random number generators were op-erated continuously throughout the duration of the experiment. Outcome measures: For the cell cultures, the outcome measure was the difference in mean colonies formed under healing intention versus control conditions, and the change in these differences over the 3 -day experi-ment. For the random number generators, the outcome measure was the variance in the distribution of random numbers generated, compared to chance expectation. Results: There was no overall difference in growth between treated and control cells. A treatment by day interaction indicated that treated cells grew more than control cells as the experiment progressed (p 0. 02). The three random number generators deviated from chance expectation on the morning of the third day of the experiment (combined peak associated with p 0. 00009). Conclusions: Results were consistent with the postulate that healing intention, applied repeatedly in a given location, may alter or condition that site so as to enhance the growth of treated cell cultures compared to un-treated controls. Repeated intentions also appear to be associated with a general increase in negentropy or sta-tistical order. 10...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to create a}} {{requirement}} specification for a <b>shielding</b> gas <b>chamber</b> for laser welding and/or laser metal deposition. This to improve the understanding of requirements that are needed for a chamber being able to be used in full production at Volvo Aero, Trollhättan. During welding in Titanium {{it is very important to}} protect welding areas from oxygen. The idea of using a chamber instead of local shielding is not new. However, when there are many welds to be performed in the same operation and/or the access to shield the weld (or rootside of weld) is difficult it might be advantages to use a chamber. For metal deposition it is even more difficult (and thereby costly) to use local shielding. The information and results have been gathered from daily interviews with operators and engineers with experience of welding and metal deposition. Internal documents, literature and participating in the manufacturing process have also contributed. The conclusion of the work led up to a list of requirements for a <b>shielding</b> gas <b>chamber</b> that will be used when welding or metal deposition are performed on components for the aerospace industry. It is not the design of the chamber that has been achieved with this work; it is the requirement for the chamber that will influence the design of the <b>shielding</b> gas <b>chamber.</b> During this work it was clear that some parts were more important than others: How to realize an oxygen free atmosphere Temperature in the chamber Materials for the chamberThe difficult part of finding essential information was the fact that nothing was found if any other company uses the same welding technology along with the material used.

30|$|Living {{organisms are}} exposed to the {{geomagnetic}} field (GMF) throughout their lifespan. Elimination of the GMF, resulting in a hypogeomagnetic field (HMF), leads to central nervous system dysfunction and abnormal development in animals. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects have not been identified so far. Here, we show that exposure to an HMF (< 200 nT), produced by a magnetic field <b>shielding</b> <b>chamber,</b> promotes the proliferation of neural progenitor/stem cells (NPCs/NSCs) from C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Following seven-day HMF-exposure, the primary neurospheres (NSs) were significantly larger in size, and twice more NPCs/NSCs were harvested from neonatal NSs, when compared to the GMF controls. The self-renewal capacity and multipotency of the NSs were maintained, as HMF-exposed NSs were positive for NSC markers (Nestin and Sox 2), and could differentiate into neurons and astrocyte/glial cells and be passaged continuously. In addition, adult mice exposed to the HMF for one month were observed to have a greater number of proliferative cells in the subventricular zone. These findings indicate that continuous HMF-exposure increases the proliferation of NPCs/NSCs, in vitro and in vivo. HMF-disturbed NPCs/NSCs production probably affects brain development and function, which provides a novel clue for elucidating the cellular mechanisms of the bio-HMF response.|$|R
