On the other hand, in international legal doctrine the view prevails that a <b>separate</b> international <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of international organizations from the personality of member states results in separate international {{responsibility of}} international organizations from the responsibility of the member states. International <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of international organizations thus represents a shield which provides member states protection from potential international legal responsibility for acts of international organizations. However, aiming to protect the rights and interests of third parties, some authors advocate the view that the member states are, exclusively due to their membership, concurrently or secondarily liable for internationally wrongful acts committed by international organizations. Nevertheless, acceptance of concurrent and secondary liability of member states, based solely on their membership, would result in interference by member states in the activities of international organizations and would thereby bring into question the autonomy and <b>separate</b> international <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of international organizations. Although the International Law Commission has rejected the possibility of concurrent and secondary liability of member states, based solely on their membership, the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations from 2011 anticipated international legal responsibility of member states for internationally wrongful acts committed by international organizations.

40|$|Imperfect Personality in Commercial Law Robert Pelikán Abstract In {{the theory}} of law, <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> (the terms "legal person" and "legal personality" are used in this text in their {{continental}} sense, i. e. describing both non-human and human entities and their legal capacity) is usually seen as a simple quality having only values, true or false. The existing theories of <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> were, therefore, trying to find such characteristics of <b>legal</b> <b>personality,</b> which will fully describe all legal persons existing in practice. Such an effort had to fail or, more precisely, the process of search for such a common denominator had to result in the disappearance of all the key characteristics necessary for understanding of the phenomenon of <b>legal</b> <b>personality.</b> The exploration of <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> must hence begin with the finding that <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> is not a quality having only values - true or false - but rather a full scale of values from nil to a (rarely seen) full <b>legal</b> <b>personality,</b> moreover appearing in many dimensions.

40|$|The <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> (or capacity) is an {{attribute}} that can {{belong to the}} participators in international relations. It divides {{all the members of}} international society into two groups. First of them consists of entities, that enjoy the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> - we describe them as subjects of international law. In this group belong states, intergovernmental organisations (so called IGOs) and a group of various other units, e. g. The Holy See or the Sovereign Order of Malta. The second group is composed from the entities without <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> under international law. Here we could find wide group of non-governmental organisations and strong supranational corporations. They may possess significant political power and heavily influence deciding of the states and intergovernmental organisations, they may have <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> under municipal law but they do not enjoy the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> under the international public law. The <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> is defined as possessing rights and duties enforceable at law. It means, that the subject under international law can conclude agreements, can enter into diplomatic relations (enjoys so called right of legation), can submit claims and act before international court or judge, has right to enjoy immunities for itself and for its representatives, can become a member of international organisation or become a party of international convention and also has to hold the responsibility for own unlawful actions. International organisations, as a subject of international law, enjoy the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> different from the personality of member states. There is no doubt about the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of European Communities. Every of the three charters founding the European Coal and Steal Community, European Community and Euroatom includes explicit provision, that the founded organisation enjoys <b>legal</b> <b>personality.</b> Looking at the Maastricht and as well at the Amsterdam treaty, we cannot find any smilar provision concerning the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of European Union. The issue of whether the Union has <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> is disputed. The prevailing view is been that it was not the will of the member states to give the Union <b>legal</b> <b>personality.</b> Expert opinion generally maintains that an international organisation such as the European Union doesn't have the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> unless its founders confer such personality on it expressly. In contradistinction to the original treaties about Communities the member states in Maastricht treaty did not acknowledged the personality of Union. Article 24 and 38 of the Treaty of the European Union (added by the Treaty of Amsterdam) give the Council of the European Union the capacity to conclude international agreements. But this competence is strictly limited only on areas covered by the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters and only when it is necessary to implement those titles. The legal effects of such agreement apply only on member states individually and according to the terms and conditions laid down by national law. Regarding this provision the European Union must be seen as a Union of States without <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of its own under international public or domestic law, which, when it takes action at international level, does so on the behalf of the member states on not on his own account. The question of <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> was comprehensively researched by the European Convention. There was created a working group on <b>legal</b> <b>personality.</b> The group examined the matter closely and for the purpose heard the views of a number of experts. In the final report that was brought into open in October 2002 the working group recommended conferring explicit <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> on the Union. The single <b>legal</b> <b>personality,</b> according to the opinion of working group, should replace the existing <b>legal</b> <b>personalities.</b> The question of <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> was one of the "simple" issues discussed by Convention. The working group on <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> has finished its search quite early (comparing with other working groups) and the final report was established on broad consensus. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>personality</b> is {{generally}} {{understood as the}} capability to be - in traditional anthropomorphic terms - ‘the bearer of legal rights and obligations’. <b>Legal</b> <b>personality</b> is a structuring tool in legal systems, not least that of international law, as it indicates who are the participants. This paper considers the concept of ‘legal personality’ in two different roles, which are mutually constitutive. The concept works as an epistemic tool in theoretical reflections on the workings of international law, {{while at the same}} time it denotes a doctrinal category within the system of international law. Both functions are taken into account, with a concomitant shifting between levels of analysis, and a look also at the actual candidates for international <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> which over time have emerged in different political contexts. The paper discusses a sequence of moments in the development of the form and use of the concept that seem especially significant. These are, with a loose indication of time periods: <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> as a sign for legal existence (17 th century) (part 2); the external aspect of <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> and its structuring effect (18 th century) (part 3); <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> as the flipside of the reified state (19 th century) (part 4); contestation of anthropomorphic conceptualisation of <b>legal</b> <b>personality,</b> and challenge of the closed doctrinal category of international legal persons (Interbellum) (part 5); <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> turning from a constitutive to a declaratory legal statement (UN era) (part 6); and the potential impact on the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> concept of post-subject and post-human lines of thought (from the 1990 s) (part 7). While the paper thus gives a diachronical account of the concept of ILP, the identified moments in its development are also continuing and co-existing aspects of the concept. For example, while it is true that an intense concern for the state as the sole legal person in international law came to the fore in the second half of the 19 th century, the central position of the state is also an important element in the contemporary discourse on international <b>legal</b> <b>personality...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is an {{analysis}} of changes in Czech substantive private law resulting from the New Civil Code no. 89 / 2012 Coll, and the Act on Business Corporations no. 90 / 2012 Coll., with an impact on tax law {{as a part of}} finance law, in particular on regulation of income taxes.

2500|$|Companies {{are legal}} persons, created by {{registering}} a constitution and paying a fee, at Companies House. Like a natural person, {{a company can}} incur legal duties and can hold rights. During its life, a company must have a board of directors, which usually hires employees. These people represent the company, and act on its behalf. They can use and deal with property, make contracts, settle trusts, or maybe through some misfortune commission torts. A company regularly becomes indebted through all of these events. Three main kinds of debts in commerce are, first, those arising through a specific debt instrument issued on a market (e.g. a corporate bond or credit note), second, through loan credit advanced to a company on terms for repayment (e.g. a bank loan or mortgage) and, third, sale credit (e.g. when a company receives goods or services but has not yet paid for them. However, the principle of <b>separate</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> means that in general, the company is the first [...] "person" [...] to have the liabilities. The agents of a company (directors and employees) are not usually liable for obligations, unless specifically assumed. Most companies also have limited liability for investors. Under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 74(2)(d) this means shareholders cannot be generally sued for obligations a company creates. This principle generally holds wherever the debt arises because of a commercial contract. The House of Lords confirmed the [...] "corporate veil" [...] will not be [...] "lifted" [...] in Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd. Here, a bootmaker was not liable for his company's debts {{even though he was}} effectively the only person who ran the business and owned the shares. In cases where a debt arises upon a tort against a non-commercial creditor, limited liability ceases to be an issue, because a duty of care can be owed regardless. This was held to be the case in Chandler v Cape plc, where a former employee of an insolvent subsidiary company successfully sued the (solvent) parent company for personal injury. When the company has no money left, and nobody else can be sued, the creditors may take over the company's management. Creditors usually appoint an insolvency practitioner to carry out an administration procedure (to rescue the company and pay creditors) or else enter liquidation (to sell off the assets and pay creditors). A moratorium takes effect to prevent any individual creditor enforcing a claim against the company. so only the insolvency practitioner, {{under the supervision of the}} court, can make distributions to creditors.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} case based {{exceptions}} to the Salomon principle, though their restrictive scope is not wholly stable. The present rule under English law is that only where a company {{was set up to}} commission fraud, or to avoid a pre-existing obligation can its separate identity be ignored. This follows from a Court of Appeal case, Adams v Cape Industries plc. A group of employees suffered asbestos diseases after working for the American wholly owned subsidiary of Cape Industries plc. They were suing in New York to make Cape Industries plc pay for the debts of the subsidiary. Under conflict of laws principles, this could only be done if Cape Industries plc was treated as [...] "present" [...] in America through its US subsidiary (i.e. ignoring the <b>separate</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of the two companies). Rejecting the claim, and following the reasoning in Jones v Lipman, the Court of Appeal emphasised that the US subsidiary had been set up for a lawful purpose of creating a group structure overseas, and had not aimed to circumvent liability in the event of asbestos litigation. The potentially unjust result for tort victims, who are unable to contract around limited liability and may be left only with a worthless claim against a bankrupt entity, has been changed in Chandler v Cape plc so that a duty of care may be owed by a parent to workers of a subsidiary regardless of separated legal personality. However even though tort victims are protected, the restrictive position remains subject to criticism where a company group is involved, since {{it is not clear that}} companies and actual people ought to get the protection of limited liability in identical ways. An influential decision, although subsequently doubted strongly by the House of Lords, was passed by Lord Denning MR in DHN Ltd v Tower Hamlets BC. Here Lord Denning MR held that a group of companies, two subsidiaries wholly owned by a parent, constituted a single economic unit. Because the companies' shareholders and controlling minds were identical, their rights were to be treated as the same. This allowed the parent company to claim compensation from the council for compulsory purchase of its business, which it could not have done without showing an address on the premises that its subsidiary possessed. Similar approaches to treating corporate [...] "groups" [...] or a [...] "concern" [...] as single economic entities exist in many continental European jurisdictions. This is done for tax and accounting purposes in English law, however for general civil liability the rule still followed is that in Adams v Cape Industries plc. It is very rare for English courts to lift the veil. The liability of the company is generally attributed to the company alone.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} why the British {{central government}} can make contracts without statutory power. It argues that, to bear contractual rights, 'government' {{must be a}} legal person with <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> extending to those rights. This constitutes a requirement for positive legal authorisation for government action with legal effect akin to that of natural persons' actions (including contracting). Further, government contracting power is subject to judicial review, which constrains the purposes and manner of its exercise. This makes wholesale comparisons with the contracting power of natural persons inappropriate. The thesis next examines and rejects two commonly advanced explanations of government contracting power: the 'third source' and 'the Crown' as corporation sole. The 'third source' theory â that government is free to act absent some prohibition â fails altogether to identify what legal person 'government' is and to explain the extent of its <b>legal</b> <b>personality.</b> The view that {{because it is a}} corporation sole 'the Crown' (here seen as a <b>separate</b> <b>legal</b> person from the Sovereign) has contracting power is also flawed: historical legal material suggests corporations sole were not <b>separate</b> <b>legal</b> persons and that the only legal effects of sole corporateness were property descending to the corporatorâs successors (not heirs) and limits on dispositive power; for the Sovereign even this is doubtful in view of the prerogative. This thesis then argues that the best explanation of government contracting power is that the Sovereign is a natural person and, for that reason, has power to contract (subject to judicial review constraints). 'The Crown' simply means 'the Sovereign'; government officers act as her agents when placing contracts. This view has explicit Commonwealth and implicit English support in authority. Academic objections are unpersuasive. While further conceptual possibilities may exist, the natural person explanation of government contracting is conceptually coherent and best represents the law. </p...|$|R
