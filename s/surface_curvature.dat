25|$|Fowler–Nordheim-type equations, in the J-F form, are (approximate) {{theoretical}} equations derived {{to describe}} the local current density J emitted from the internal electron states in the conduction band of a bulk metal. The emission current density (ECD) J for some small uniform region of an emitting surface is usually expressed as a function J(φ,F) of the local work-function φ and the local barrier field F that characterize the small region. For sharply curved surfaces, J may also depend on the parameter(s) used {{to describe the}} <b>surface</b> <b>curvature.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} {{described here}} was originally developed to describe FowlerNordheim tunneling from smooth, classically flat, planar emitting surfaces. It is adequate for smooth, classical curved surfaces of radii {{down to about}} 10 to 20nm. It {{can be adapted to}} surfaces of sharper radius, but quantities such as ν and D then become significant functions of the parameter(s) used to describe the <b>surface</b> <b>curvature.</b> When the emitter is so sharp that atomic-level detail cannot be neglected, and/or the tunneling barrier is thicker than the emitter-apex dimensions, then a more sophisticated approach is desirable.|$|E
25|$|The RAE first {{tested it}} in an “as delivered” configuration. The wing airfoil was {{designed}} to support laminar flow to 60% of chord. In the “as delivered” configuration, a profile drag was measured which was representative of the wing section with boundary layer transition {{at the leading edge}} (0% laminar flow). Reducing the surface roughness reduced the drag at low lift coefficients to a level representative of laminar flow to 35% of chord. Measurements were made of the surface waviness. This showed peak wave amplitudes, above the mean, of approximately 0.011 inches over a two-inch span. The standard waviness criteria shows the critical wave height to be 0.0053 inches for this application. To reduce the waviness, RAE personnel stripped the wing to bare metal. The wing was then sprayed with two coats of primer paint and a coat of paint type filler. After the paint was dry, it was sanded in a chordwise direction, using sanding blocks, whose curvature matched the local <b>surface</b> <b>curvature.</b> This was repeated several times. Surface waviness was then measured and found to be no more than 0.005 inches. In flight, this configuration was found to have a profile drag representative of boundary layer transition at 60% of chord. This gave researchers an idea of what level of wing surface quality was required to actually get the benefits of laminar flow airfoils.|$|E

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} {{scene analysis}} in an unconstrained and uncontrolled environment {{is the ultimate}} goal of computer vision. Explicit depth information about the scene is of tremendous help in segmentation and recognition of objects. Range image interpretation with a view of obtaining low-level features to guide mid-level and high-level segmentation and recognition processes is described. No assumptions about the scene are made and algorithms are applicable to any general single viewpoint range image. Low-level features like step edges and surface characteristics are extracted from the images and segmentation is performed based on individual features as well as combination of features. A high level recognition process based on superquadric fitting is described to demonstrate the usefulness of initial segmentation based on edges. A classification algorithm based on <b>surface</b> <b>curvatures</b> is used to obtain initial segmentation of the scene.

2500|$|Equilibrium {{of forces}} on the surface is {{required}} for a bubble to exist. The sum of the Ambient pressure and pressure due to tissue distortion, exerted {{on the outside of}} the surface, with surface tension of the liquid at the interface between the bubble and the surroundings must be balanced by the pressure on the inside of the bubble. This is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases inside due to the net diffusion of gas to and from the bubble. The force balance on the bubble may be modified by a layer of surface active molecules which can stabilise a microbubble at a size where surface tension on a clean bubble would cause it to collapse rapidly, and this surface layer may vary in permeability, so that if the bubble is sufficiently compressed it may become impermeable to diffusion. If the solvent outside the bubble is saturated or unsaturated, the partial pressure will be less than in the bubble, and the surface tension will be increasing the internal pressure in direct proportion to <b>surface</b> <b>curvature,</b> providing a pressure gradient to increase diffusion out of the bubble, effectively [...] "squeezing the gas out of the bubble", and the smaller the bubble the faster it will get squeezed out. A gas bubble can only grow at constant pressure if the surrounding solvent is sufficiently supersaturated to overcome the surface tension or if the surface layer provides sufficient reaction to overcome surface tension. Clean bubbles that are sufficiently small will collapse due to surface tension if the supersaturation is low. Bubbles with semipermeable surfaces will either stabilise at a specific radius depending on the pressure, the composition of the surface layer, and the supersaturation, or continue to grow indefinitely, if larger than the critical radius. Bubble formation can occur in the blood or other tissues.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe biometric, {{optical and}} {{physical}} properties of 19 pairs of isolated human eye-bank lenses {{ranging in age}} from 5 to 96 years were compared. Lens focal length and spherical aberration were measured using a scanning laser apparatus, lens thickness and the lens <b>surface</b> <b>curvatures</b> were measured by digitizing the lens profiles and equivalent refractive indices were calculated for each lens using this data. The second lens from each donor was used to measure resistance to physical deformation by providing a compressive force to the lens. The lens capsule was then removed from each lens and each measurement was repeated to ascertain what role the capsule plays in determining these optical and physical characteristics. Age dependent changes in lens focal length, lens <b>surface</b> <b>curvatures</b> and lens resistance to physical deformation are described. Isolated lens focal length was found to be significantly linearly correlated with both the anterior and posterior <b>surface</b> <b>curvatures.</b> No age dependent change in equivalent refractive index of the isolated lens was found. Although decapsulating human lenses causes similar changes in focal length to that which we have shown to occur when human lenses are mechanically stretched into an unaccommodated state, the effects are due to nonsystematic changes in lens curvatures. These studies reinforce the conclusion that lens hardening must be considered as an important factor in the development of presbyopia, that age changes in the human lens are not limited to the loss of accommodation that characterizes presbyopia but that the lens optical and physical properties change substantially with age in a complex manner...|$|R
