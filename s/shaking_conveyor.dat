40|$|WO 2004083768 A UPAB: 20041019 NOVELTY - High-strength planar {{structures}} for end-ballistic protection and protection against wear comprises individual bodies {{that provide the}} high-strength planar structure when applied to a backing material and/or completely or partly surrounded by a backing material. The individual bodies have the shape of regular pyramids and terahedrons or irregular pentahedrons and/or hexahedrons and/or the individual bodies consist of combined and interlinked shapes (compound shapes) of regular pyramids and tetrahedrons or irregular pentahedrons and/or hexahedrons. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included {{for the production of}} high-strength planar structures. Preferred Features: The individual bodies and/or the compound bodies are made completely or partly of ceramic and/or metallic materials. USE - For end-ballistic protection, e. g. of vehicles and people, and protection against wear, e. g. in crushers, mills, <b>shaking</b> <b>conveyors</b> and pipes. ADVANTAGE - The planar structure is destroyed only in the immediate vicinity of an impact...|$|R
40|$|One {{method for}} realizing the self-orientation of {{workpieces}} for grasping by a robot is {{by means of}} a <b>shaking</b> belt <b>conveyor.</b> Control of small perturbations around the steady state leads to the control of a linear time-periodic system. We propose and successfully implement an approach for control based on a novel application of FloquetLyapunov theory. 1 INTRODUCTION A <b>shaking</b> belt <b>conveyor</b> was proposed in [1] to achieve the self-orientation of workpieces in flexible manufacturing systems. Workpieces, initially deposited onto the conveyor with a random orientation, would acquire a known orientation by the time they are to be grasped by a robotic manipulator (see Fig. 1) {{with the aid of a}} vision system. The task of the vision system would, therefore, consist of determining only the location of on landmark point on each workpiece, since the uncertainty regarding its orientation would have been eliminated. This would significantly alleviate the computational burden on the vision system. Th [...] ...|$|R

It focuses on agriculture as a whole, on the importance of the potato in human nutrition and on technology of potatoes growing. The most important chapter is related to the potato harvest, design development of machines for potato harvesting and also to monitoring of potatoes damage at different intensities of <b>shaking</b> sieving <b>conveyor</b> potato harvesters, with the special emphasis from the fall and impact of tubers into the tank and after the impact of tubers on the bottom of an empty trailer after tank filling...|$|R

They thus leave the feeder's conveyor one-by-one, all in the same orientation. This conveyor then leads directly to the following assembly or packing machine.|$|R
