It consists of eleven <b>segments</b> in primitive groups and ten <b>segments</b> in more derived groups, the tenth and eleventh <b>segments</b> having fused.

5|$|Insects have {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} exoskeletons, the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin. The <b>segments</b> {{of the body}} are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax <b>segments</b> making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven <b>segments,</b> though in a few species of insects, these <b>segments</b> may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures. Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.|$|E

5|$|Somatic {{recombination}} of immunoglobulins, {{also known}} as V(D)J recombination, involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene <b>segments</b> (subgenes). These <b>segments</b> are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) <b>segments.</b> V, D and J <b>segments</b> are found in Ig heavy chains, but only V and J <b>segments</b> are found in Ig light chains. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene <b>segments</b> exist, and are tandemly arranged in the genomes of mammals. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene <b>segments</b> {{can be used to}} generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different , and thus different antigen specificities. Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.|$|E

5|$|The abdomen is {{the largest}} tagma of the insect, which {{typically}} consists of 11–12 <b>segments</b> and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax. Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum and sternum. Terga are separated {{from each other and}} from the adjacent sterna or pleura by membranes. Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites. During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal <b>segments</b> are present. In modern insects there is a tendency toward {{reduction in the number of}} the abdominal <b>segments,</b> but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable. If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for pterygotes, confusion reigns: adult Protura have 12 <b>segments,</b> Collembola have 6. The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 <b>segments,</b> and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10-segmented abdomen.|$|E
