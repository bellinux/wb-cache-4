5|$|My loving people, we {{have been}} persuaded by <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but I assure you, I do not desire to live to {{distrust}} my faithful and loving people... I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any Prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.|$|E
5|$|The Round Church {{featured}} {{marble and}} limestone cornices. These included {{a large number}} of intertwined ornaments and details, such as palmettes, grape clusters, leaves, and chamfers. Besides classic ornamental shapes, the cornices feature <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> entirely new in character or well-known yet redesigned motifs. Floral decoration dominates the cornices. Tiles found inside the church ruins depict birds and other animals in addition to geometric shapes and floral motifs, all glazed in either brown, yellow, green, blue, or blue-green. The walls were covered in polished marble facing with encrusted shapes.|$|E

5|$|Mobile {{has more}} than 45 public parks within its limits, with <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> of special note. Bienville Square is a {{historic}} park in the Lower Dauphin Street Historic District. It assumed its current form in 1850 and is named for Mobile's founder, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville. It was once a principal gathering place for {{the citizens of the}} city and remains popular today. Cathedral Square is a one-block performing arts park, also in the Lower Dauphin Street Historic District, that is overlooked by the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception. Fort Conde is a reconstruction of the city's original Fort Condé, built on the original fort's footprint. It serves as the official welcome center and colonial-era living history museum. Spanish Plaza is a downtown park that honors the Spanish phase of the city between 1780 and 1813. It features the Arches of Friendship, a fountain presented to Mobile by the city of Málaga, Spain. Langan Park, the largest of the parks at , features lakes, natural spaces, and contains the Mobile Museum of Art, Azalea City Golf Course, Mobile Botanical Gardens and Playhouse in the Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of various pure breeds and strains, including <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> rare today, was once undertaken in North America {{in large part}} by large agriculture-focused colleges and universities. However, many of these institutions have changed their focus to commercial or crossbred strains, with many herds being sent to slaughter. The Livestock Conservancy and Rare Breeds Canada intervened in some of these cases, leading to the survival and {{preservation of}} some gene stocks. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) participates in livestock preservation mainly through technology-based approaches such as gene mapping and germplasm (genetic material) storage. However, although the storage of genetic material is a useful technique in the preservation of rare breeds, it cannot preserve the entire range of genetic diversity within even an individual breed, and stored material cannot react and adapt to environmental or biological changes as live animal populations can. The US federal government rarely supports rare breed live animal population conservation, and while agricultural subsidies were once seen more than they are in present times, they were never focused on individual breeds. The Livestock Conservancy has been instrumental in preserving live populations of many rare livestock breeds in the US.|$|E
5|$|The secular {{evolution}} of the objects' orbits varies with their orbits. The orbits of some objects are metastable, for example, <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> initially aligned with Planet Nine. The orbits of these objects precess until parts of the orbits are tangent to that of Planet Nine, leading to close encounters. Some stable orbits do exist for aligned objects with smaller eccentricities. Objects in these orbits have high perihelia and {{have yet to be}} observed, however, and an additional perturbation would have been required to be captured in these orbits. The curves followed also vary with the semi-major axis of the object, with the region where aligned orbits are possible decreasing for larger semi-major axes. Without the inclusion of resonant dynamics the secular dynamics becomes more complex for inclined objects with semi-major axes beyond 300 AU. Alignment and anti-alignment is this case is more the result of sticky chaos rather than confinement with orbits evolving widely but spending more time in regions of relative stability associated with secular resonances. Including the resonant dynamics, for example if Sedna is in a 3:2 resonance with Planet Nine as proposed by Malhotra, Volk and Wang, also alters these curves and can shift the centers of the libration islands away from anti-alignment.|$|E

25|$|ThunderClan {{medicine}} cat apprentice Jaypaw finds a washed-up stick {{when he is}} out gathering herbs {{with his}} mentor, Leafpool. It has odd scratches on it; <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> crossed out and <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not. As he struggles {{to figure out what}} it means, he has a dream in which he experiences what Fallen Leaves experienced. Jaypaw then understands that the scratches record ancient cats who undertook the trial in the tunnels and that the last uncrossed one was Fallen Leaves' mark, indicating that he did not emerge.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which mycorrhizae increase absorption include <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> physical and <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> chemical. Physically, most mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root or root hair, and thus can explore soil material that roots and root hairs cannot reach, and provide a larger surface area for absorption. Chemically, the cell membrane chemistry of fungi {{differs from that of}} plants. For example, they may secrete organic acid that dissolve or chelate many ions, or release them from minerals by ion exchange. Mycorrhizae are especially beneficial for the plant partner in nutrient-poor soils.|$|E

25|$|However, despite {{there being}} a wealth of {{statistically}} supported studies towards the rooting of {{the tree of life}} between the Bacteria and the Neomura by means of a variety of methods, including <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> impervious to accelerated evolution—which is claimed by Cavalier-Smith to be the source of the supposed fallacy in molecular methods—there are a few studies which have drawn different conclusions, some of which place the root in the phylum Firmicutes with nested archaea.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{eukaryotic}} {{cells have}} {{each of the}} organelles listed below. Exceptional organisms have cells that do not include some organelles {{that might otherwise be}} considered universal to eukaryotes (such as mitochondria). There are also occasional exceptions to the number of membranes surrounding organelles, listed in the tables below (e.g., <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> listed as double-membrane are sometimes found with single or triple membranes). In addition, the number of individual organelles of each type found in a given cell varies depending upon the function of that cell.|$|E

25|$|A king of Kish, Mesilim, {{appears to}} have ruled at Adab, based on {{inscriptions}} found at Bismaya. One king of Adab, Lugal-Anne-Mundu, appearing in the Sumerian King List, is mentioned in few contemporary inscriptions; <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> much later copies claim that he established a vast, but brief empire stretching from Elam {{all the way to}} Lebanon and the Amorite territories along the Jordan. Adab is also mentioned in some of the Ebla tablets from roughly the same era as a trading partner of Ebla in northern Syria, shortly before Ebla was destroyed by unknown forces.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} a number of {{vegetation}} communities of lesser extent, including <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> considered endangered or at risk. Most notable is the critically endangered community of Muehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita and Tecticornia verrucosa that occurs on the lake beds of the Lake Bryde-East Lake Bryde wetland system. Gypsum dunes support a vulnerable ecological community of herblands and bunch grasslands, and an at-risk community of Eucalyptus aff. incrassata over low scrub; at least 80 plant species are likely to occur only on gypsum dunes, including several threatened species. Some plant communities of the Bremer Range are also considered vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|Breeds as we {{know them}} today did not exist before Victorian times, but local {{variations}} of the ancestors of current breeds came into America along with their owners and livestock. Included are <b>some</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> now extinct or that have merged into other breeds. These may have included some British herding dogs, native dogs from North America (originating in Asia/Siberia), as well as dogs from Germany and Spain including the Carea Leonés. For many centuries, shepherds were more interested in dogs' working abilities than their appearance. As a result, over time, shepherds interbred dogs that they believed would produce better workers for the given climate and landscape. In the eastern U.S., terrain and weather conditions were similar to that of Europe, so the existing imported breeds and their offspring worked well there.|$|E
