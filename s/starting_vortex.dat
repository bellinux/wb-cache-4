5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the <b>starting</b> <b>vortex</b> for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} wear and tear on the wings.|$|E
25|$|Insect {{flight is}} {{considerably}} different, {{due to their}} small size, rigid wings, and other anatomical differences. Turbulence and vortices play a much larger role in insect flight, making it even more complex and difficult to study than the flight of vertebrates. There are two basic aerodynamic models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling-and-clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the <b>starting</b> <b>vortex</b> for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} wear and tear on the wings.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{method of}} flight, clap and fling, or the Weis-Fogh mechanism, {{functions}} differently. In this process, found in very small insects such as thrips and chalcid wasps, the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in {{and creates a}} vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the <b>starting</b> <b>vortex</b> for the other wing. By this effect, circulation and thus, lift are increased {{to the extent of}} being higher, in most cases, than the typical leading edge vortex effect. [...] One of the reasons this method is not employed by more insects is the inevitable damage and wear to the wings caused by repeated clapping. It is prevalent, however, among insects that are very small and experience low Reynolds numbers. The mechanism is also employed by the marine mollusc Limacina helicina, a sea butterfly.|$|E
40|$|Qualitative {{comparison}} of bird and bat wakes has demonstrated {{significant differences in}} the structure of the far wake. Birds have been found to have a unified vortex wake of the two wings, while bats have a more complex wake with gradients in the circulation along the wingspan, and with each wing generating its own vortex structure. Here, we compare quantitative measures of the circulation in the far wake of three bird and one bat species. We find that bats have a significantly stronger normalized circulation of the <b>start</b> <b>vortex</b> than birds. We also find differences in how the circulation develops during the wingbeat as demonstrated by the ratio of the circulation of the dominant <b>start</b> <b>vortex</b> and the total circulation of the same sense. Birds show a more prominent change with changing flight speed and a relatively weaker <b>start</b> <b>vortex</b> at minimum power speed than bats. We also find that bats have a higher normalized wake loading based on the <b>start</b> <b>vortex,</b> indicating higher relative induced drag and therefore less efficient lift generation than birds. Our results thus indicate fundamental differences in the aerodynamics of bird and bat flight that will further our understanding of the evolution of vertebrate flight...|$|R

50|$|The air in {{the arena}} rises (35). This draws more air (33, 34) through {{directing}} louvers (3, 5), which cause a vortex to form (35).

50|$|The {{vorticity}} in the <b>starting</b> <b>vortex</b> {{is matched}} by the vorticity in the bound vortex in the airfoil, in accordance with Kelvin's circulation theorem. As the vorticity in the <b>starting</b> <b>vortex</b> progressively increases the vorticity in the bound vortex also progressively increases and causes the flow over the topside of the airfoil to increase in speed. The <b>starting</b> <b>vortex</b> is soon cast off the airfoil and is left behind, spinning in the air where the airfoil left it.

40|$|Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes {{computations}} {{were carried}} out on a pitching finite wing model using the finite volume solver DLR-TAU. The comparison with the experimental data reveals a good agreement, especially {{in the region of}} the first occurrence of stall. Discrepancies are observed in the blade tip region, where the flow in the numerical data shows a stronger separation along with larger hysteresis effects in contrast to the experiment. An investigation with different pitching frequencies revealed a change in the sequence of dynamic stall vortex formation in the spanwise direction. For the lowest frequency the propagation of the stall <b>vortex</b> <b>starts</b> at the wing tip and then spreads rootwards, whereas for the higher frequencies the first evolution of the dynamic stall <b>vortex</b> <b>starts</b> further inboard, subsequently propagating in tipward and rootward directions. An investigation using a γ-Reθt approach demonstrated that small differences can be attributed to transition, nevertheless these can give further insight in the physics of dynamic stall and improve the comparability with the experiment.

50|$|Whenever {{the speed}} or {{angle of attack}} of an airfoil changes there is a weak <b>starting</b> <b>vortex</b> which begins to form, either above or below the {{trailing}} edge.

40|$|A sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) {{in early}} January 2013 caused the Arctic polar vortex to split and {{temperatures}} to rapidly {{rise above the}} threshold for chlorine activation. However, ozone in the lower stratospheric polar vortex from late December 2012 through early February 2013 reached the lowest values on record for that time of year. Analysis of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) trace gas measurements and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) data shows that exceptional chemical ozone loss early in the 2012 / 13 Arctic winter resulted from a unique combination of meteorological conditions associated with the early-January 2013 SSW: unusually low temperatures in December 2012, offspring vortices within which air remained well isolated for nearly 1 month after the vortex split, and greater-than-usual vortex sunlight exposure throughout December 2012 and January 2013. Conditions in the two offspring vortices differed substantially, with the one overlying Canada having lower temperatures, lower nitric acid (HNO 3), lower hydrogen chloride, more sunlight exposure/higher ClO in late January, and a later onset of chlorine deactivation than the one overlying Siberia. MLS HNO 3 and CALIPSO data indicate that PSC activity in December 2012 was more extensive and persistent than {{at that time in}} any other Arctic winter in the past decade. Chlorine monoxide (ClO, measured by MLS) rose earlier than previously observed and was the largest on record through mid-January 2013. Enhanced vortex ClO persisted until mid-February despite the cessation of PSC activity when the SSW <b>started.</b> <b>Vortex</b> HNO 3 remained depressed after PSCs had disappeared; passive transport calculations indicate vortex-averaged denitrification of about 4 parts per billion by volume.
