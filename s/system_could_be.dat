5|$|In April 1962, McNamara {{asked the}} Nike team to {{consider}} using the Zeus site on Kwajalein as an operational anti-satellite base after the main Zeus testing had completed. The Nike team responded that a <b>system</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> readied for testing by May 1963. The concept {{was given the}} name Project Mudflap.|$|E
5|$|As work on Nike-X began, {{high-ranking}} {{military and}} civilian officials began to press for Zeus deployment as an interim system {{in spite of the}} known problems. They argued the <b>system</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> upgraded in-place as the new technologies became available. McNamara was opposed to early deployment, while Congressman Daniel J. Flood would be a prime force for immediate deployment.|$|E

5|$|Some {{harmless}} {{milk snake}} (Lampropeltis triangulum) subspecies, the moderately toxic false coral snakes (genus Erythrolamprus), and the deadly coral snakes (genus Micrurus) {{all have a}} red background color with black and white / yellow rings. In this system, both the milk snakes and the deadly coral snakes are mimics, whereas the false coral snakes are the model. It has also been suggested that this <b>system</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> an instance of pseudomimicry, the similar colour patterns having evolved independently in similar habitats.|$|E
5|$|There were, of course, {{numerous}} {{reasons for}} maintaining roads. A unified political <b>system</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> maintained {{only as long}} as the government had the means of quickly dispatching officials, troops, or messengers as needed. Such a system of transportation, once established, facilitated commerce. At the local level, road and bridge projects seem to have been initiated as much for the sake of traveling merchants as for officials.|$|E
5|$|This led to {{proposals}} {{for a new}} radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately {{have to deal with}} the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, the <b>system</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> considered disposable and did not need anything like the sophistication or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} is non-linear: {{the gravitational}} influence of two masses {{is not simply}} the sum of those masses' individual gravitational influences, as had {{been the case in}} Newtonian gravity. Ehlers participated in the discussion of how the back-reaction from gravitational radiation onto a radiating <b>system</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> systematically described in a non-linear theory such as general relativity, pointing out that the standard quadrupole formula for the energy flux for systems like the binary pulsar had not (yet) been rigorously derived: a priori, a derivation demanded the inclusion of higher-order terms than was commonly assumed, higher than were computed until then.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{news media}} and {{government}} officials soon began to discuss the apparent substandard construction styles that had caused so many of Armenia's buildings to collapse. Gorbachev, in a TV interview several weeks after his expedited return from New York City, said that the concrete blocks had been built with more than enough sand but too little concrete, and suggested that the concrete had been stolen. , deputy chairman of the state building committee, stated that many newer homes collapsed as well {{and that he was}} beginning an investigation into the matter and that criminal charges would be brought. The official communist party newspaper Pravda said that poor construction, like other issues of neglect in the Soviet <b>system,</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> blamed on the Era of Stagnation from the era of Leonid Brezhnev.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann was {{the first}} to {{establish}} a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, known as the Dirac–von Neumann axioms, with his 1932 work Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics. After having completed the axiomatization of set theory, he began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics. He realized, in 1926, that a state of a quantum <b>system</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> represented by a point in a (complex) Hilbert space that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. In this formalism of quantum mechanics, observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as linear operators acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system.|$|E

5|$|While in Egypt, Fairley {{investigated}} schistosomiasis (then {{known as}} bilharzia). The disease {{was known to}} be caused by contact with fresh water inhabited by certain species of snails, and orders had been issued that prohibited bathing in fresh water, but the troops were slow to appreciate the danger involved. In its toxic phase, the disease was easily confused with typhus, so Fairley developed a complement fixation test for the disease {{along the lines of the}} Wassermann test. He studied its pathology, confirming that the worms in the circulatory <b>system</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> cured by intravenous tartaric acid. Fairley also studied, and later published papers on typhus, malaria, and bacillary dysentery.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} has erupted {{since the late}} 20thcentury over the four lower Snake River dams, with the primary argument being that removing the dams would allow anadromous fish to reach the lower Snake River tributaries—the Clearwater River, the Tucannon River and the Grande Ronde River—and spawn in much higher numbers. However, removal of the dams has been fiercely opposed by some groups in the Pacific Northwest. Because much of the electricity in the Northwest comes from dams, removing the four dams would create {{a hole in the}} energy grid that would not be immediately replaceable. Navigation on the lower Snake would also suffer, as submerged riffles, rapids and islands would be exposed by the removal of the dams. Irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern Washington would also have to reach further to access the water of the Snake River. However, aside from restoring salmon runs, dam removal proponents argue that the power is replaceable, that the grain transportation <b>system</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> replaced by railroads, and that only one of the four reservoirs supplies irrigation water. Irrigators in the Snake River Plain would likely need to allow less water into the Snake River during low flow {{in order to create a}} current in the four lower reservoirs, and recreation and tourism would likely benefit.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} made in September 2008, the Social Democrats, the Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party and the Danish People's Party {{agreed to}} not fund {{an expansion of}} the metro northwest. Initially, the system operated trains from 01:00 to 05:00 only on Thursdays through Saturdays, but, starting on 19 March 2009, night service was extended {{to the rest of the}} week. This caused a logistical challenge, because Metro Service used the nights for maintenance. The routes were therefore set up in such a way that the <b>system</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> operated on only a single track, leaving the other free for work. In May 2009, six companies were pre-qualified to bid for the public service obligation to operate the metro. These were Serco-NedRailways, Ansaldo STS, Arriva, S-Bahn Hamburg, Keolis and DSB Metro—a joint venture between DSB and RATP. The process was delayed because of a procedural error by Metroselskabet, who failed to pre-qualify DSB Metro.|$|E

30|$|Monitoring - Metrics Collection. While {{applications}} are running, the cloud infrastructure and the applications must be monitored. Monitoring {{must be as}} unobtrusive as possible, but must also capture essential data to determine if performance goals are being met. One or more monitoring <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used to collect data from different levels of the entire computing infrastructure. In a cloud environment, this could include monitoring the physical servers, hypervisors, the guest OSs, and the virtual applications themselves. While different monitoring <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used, all collected information must be collated and made available for the next functions.|$|R

5|$|One of the cruiser's early {{commanding}} officers, Royal Navy Captain J.W.A. Waller, {{believed that}} the ship's single director control tower was a weak point in the design. The director control tower was the highest compartment on the ship, from where personnel would determine the range and optimum firing angle for a gun salvo, then transmit this information to the gun turrets: the actual firing could be controlled from the tower or the turret. Waller {{believed that the}} centralised <b>system</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> destroyed with a single hit, or the wiring linking the compartment to the turrets could be severed, forcing the four turrets to rely on independent control. Although Waller suggested that a second tower be installed aft to provide redundancy, it was deferred indefinitely as subsequent commanding officers did not share his concerns, and combat experiences of other Leander-class cruisers showed that the system was more robust than expected.|$|E
