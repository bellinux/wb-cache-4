6000|$|Those of {{the castle}} who had not gotten to horse, still {{continued}} to fight desperately with the besiegers, after {{the departure of the}} Templar, but rather in despair of quarter than that they entertained any hope of escape. The fire was spreading rapidly through all parts {{of the castle}}, when Ulrica, who had first kindled it, appeared on a turret, in the guise of one of the ancient furies, yelling forth a war-song, such as was of yore raised on the field of battle by the scalds of the yet heathen Saxons. Her long dishevelled grey hair flew back from her uncovered head; the inebriating delight of gratified vengeance contended in her eyes with the fire of insanity; and she brandished the distaff which she held in her hand, {{as if she had been}} one of the Fatal Sisters, who spin and abridge the thread of human life.

40|$|The O 2 uptake {{of firefighters}} working in hot and {{polluted}} environment is not known. The portable Metamax II might measure the O 2 uptake of firefighters using a breathing apparatus. However, the Metamax requires an inspiration signal between two expirations to work properly. When a firefighter inspires from bottles with pressurised air, the inspired air cannot readily be {{passed through a}} metabolic analyser. Expired air {{is on the other}} hand released to the surroundings and may be sampled for further analyses. In addition, the Metamax II does not tolerate heat, and gases at the <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> may damage its delicate sensors. We have modified the Metamax II, producing an artificial inspiration signal after every expiration.

The robot system consists of a tracked vehicle which pulls the fire fighting equipment to the <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> To perform the task and to navigate the robot safely to the target position, the operator needs sufficient information of the robot's environment.

40|$|Many {{attempts}} concerning teleoperated {{fire fighting}} were made without much success so far. In this paper {{a new approach}} towards teleoperated fire fighting is presented that bases on experiences of the past.

40|$|In recent years, {{many experts}} and {{technicians}} have done extensive research {{in many respects}} such as the computer software for fire, experimental simulation, material thermal physical measurement, which put forward the Fire prediction theory, and these theoretical results were data-centric, existing {{in the form of}} multi-source heterogeneous. The existing fire service system can't make vast amounts of multi-source heterogeneous fusion effectively, and it can't timely organize and analyze the data, for it is lacking the comprehensive analysis function. This paper, based on the hyper geographical markup language HGML and Fire spreading algorithm model, designed a kind of fire data management, which can be applied to rescue command simulation systems. The system can make the geographic coordinates of the <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and the multi-source heterogeneous data fusion effectively. And it can comprehensively analyze the date and use 3 D simulation of the scene to put forward the aided decision and rescue plan.

Tunnel lining {{is made up of}} reinforced concrete duct pieces. Concrete is a kind of non-homogeneous composite material, which would experience complex changing both physically and chemically by the high temperature, and the changing will surely lead to the descent of the carrying capability of the integral mechanical properties. The thesis studies the basic rules of the tunnel on fire and the damage of the tunnel lining structure and the inner equipments by the high temperature, which is set in the Yangtze River Tunnel in Shanghai, thus contributes to analyze the demand of the joint action of the disaster prevention, the ventilation system and other equipment and to reduce the fire loss...|$|E

Printed caption on reverse reads"Shantung Province is full {{of ancient}} twons, {{enclosed}} with walls, Mouping being one of them. It is situated halfway between Chefoo and Weihaiwei and was called Ninghaichow in the Ming Dynasty. The town being on a comparatively extensive scale, Liu-chennien (one of the commanders of motley troops) has made it {{the base of his}} military operations. While Changtsungchang, now a political refugee in Japan, was the master of the province, this town was made a <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and blood at intervals.

40|$|Introduction and {{objective}} Firefighters {{are considered a}} healthy and fit group of individuals, well-prepared for taking action in disaster situations. While working, they suffer from exposure to certain toxic agents, especially combustion products generated when a fire takes place. Among them, the most frequent and the most toxic are: carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, and those resulting from PVC combustion – hydrochloride, phosgene and chloride. Additionally, fire-extinguisher powder can be inhaled and lead to certain lesion in the airways. The aim of study was to ascertain the influence of toxic agents present at the <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> on the lung tissue of firefighters, and also to study this on an animal model. Material and Methods The study group consisted of firefighters who had a minimum of 10 years service. After completing a questionnaire, their clinical status was ascertained based on a general examination, laboratory tests and lung function tests. Results Questionnaire analysis showed {{a high percentage of}} pathological symptoms in the studied group. The incidence of the symptoms correlated with the duration of occupational exposure to toxic agents. Among other results, obstruction of flow in medium airways in about 30 % of the studied individuals represented the most important finding. Experimental tests were next performed on male Wistar rats, aged 3 months. They were insufflated with the solution of powdered fire-extinguisher, after which morphology specimens of lung tissue were studied. Evidence for disseminated fibrosis was obtained, which supported the previous clinical findings in the firefighters. Conclusions The above shows correlation between occupational exposure and respiratory system involvement in firefighters. This justifies covering the group of firefighters with special medical care focused on prophilaxis, early detection and therapy of pulmonary diseases...|$|E
