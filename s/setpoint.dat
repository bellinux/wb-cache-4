25|$|Two basic {{requirements}} are regulation (disturbance rejection – {{staying at a}} given <b>setpoint)</b> and command tracking (implementing <b>setpoint</b> changes) – these refer to how well the controlled variable tracks the desired value. Specific criteria for command tracking include rise time and settling time. Some processes must not allow an overshoot of the process variable beyond the <b>setpoint</b> if, for example, this would be unsafe. Other processes must minimize the energy expended in reaching a new <b>setpoint.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Setpoint</b> {{weighting}} adds adjustable factors (usually between 0 and 1) to the <b>setpoint</b> in {{the error}} in the proportional and derivative element of the controller. The {{error in the}} integral term must be the true control error to avoid steady-state control errors. These two extra parameters do not affect the response to load disturbances and measurement noise and can be tuned to improve the controller's <b>setpoint</b> response.|$|E
25|$|Basing {{proportional}} action on PV eliminates the instant and possibly very large change in output {{caused by a}} sudden change to the <b>setpoint.</b> Depending on the process and tuning this may be beneficial to the response to a <b>setpoint</b> step.|$|E
40|$|Optimal {{operation}} of chemical plants is usually accomplished by rst nding the optimal steady-state using the present (nominal) set of disturbances. This is usually implemented by sending con-stant <b>setpoints</b> for selected variables {{to the control}} system. The <b>setpoints</b> are then the nominally optimal values. However, because of disturbances this may result in feasibility problems, which we here try to avoid by adjusting the <b>setpoints</b> ("backo"). First, we need to avoid infeasibility in the active constraints ("constraint backo") [1]. Second, we need to adjust the <b>setpoints</b> of the uncon-strained controlled variables. This may be done by oine computation of robust <b>setpoints</b> ("optimal backo") or by online feasibility correction ("exible backo"). As a case study we consider a reactor-separator-recycle process. For this process the control structures based on Luybens rule (x a ow in every recycle loop) are infeasible if we use the nominal <b>setpoints,</b> but are feasible with reasonable loss if we use robust <b>setpoints.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Short Abstract — Rissanen’s minimum {{description}} length principle {{states that}} the best model to account for some data minimizes the bits required for digital transmission of both the model and the data as encoded via the model. Thus, description lengths are parameter-selection criteria. HLA glycoproteins regulate cellular immune responses to HIV, and are associated with infection progression. HLA polymorphism makes associating alleles with infection outcomes challenging. Comparing description lengths yields allele associations with HIV <b>setpoints,</b> which predict infection progression. Allele associations with viral <b>setpoints</b> support and extend previous studies.

25|$|In {{this case}} the PID {{controller}} measures the derivative of the measured process variable (PV), rather than the derivative of the error. This quantity is always continuous (i.e., never has a step change {{as a result of}} changed <b>setpoint).</b> This modification is a simple case of <b>setpoint</b> weighting.|$|E
25|$|The {{integral}} term accelerates {{the movement}} of the process towards <b>setpoint</b> and eliminates the residual steady-state error that occurs with a pure proportional controller. However, since the integral term responds to accumulated errors from the past, it can cause the present value to overshoot the <b>setpoint</b> value (see the section on loop tuning).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{extension}} to our QoS opti-mization algorithm, Q-RAM[7][11], that can improve optimization time by several {{orders of magnitude}} when manag-ing highly configurable tasks. A highly configurable task is one {{with a large number}} of QoS dimensions and/or a largenumber of quality levels on those dimensions. For example, an application that has ten QoS dimensions with ten qual-ity levels each will have 1010 <b>setpoints,</b> or ways in whichit can be configured. While the existing Q-RAM algorithm {{has been shown to be}} a very effective resource managementtool, it must still explicitly perform computations on all of the <b>setpoints</b> for each task. For tasks with 1010 setpointsor more, this is clearly impractical. The key idea presented here is a new approximation algorithm for the concave ma-jorant step in Q-RAM. By using this algorithm in a filtering step, the best performing subset of the <b>setpoints</b> can bequickly found without explicitly examining all of the <b>setpoints.</b> The idea is validated using a phased array radarsystem as an example application...|$|R

25|$|The {{control system}} {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the <b>setpoint</b> (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} <b>setpoint</b> and on extra measured disturbances. <b>Setpoint</b> weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E

25|$|Though IL-1 {{is useful}} in combating some diseases, {{endotoxic}} bacteria have gained an advantage by forcing the hypothalamus to increase cortisol levels (forcing the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone, thus antagonizing IL-1). The suppressor cells are not affected by glucosteroid response-modifying factor, so the effective <b>setpoint</b> for the immune cells may be even higher than the <b>setpoint</b> for physiological processes (reflecting leukocyte redistribution to lymph nodes, bone marrow, and skin). Rapid administration of corticosterone (the endogenous type I and type II receptor agonist) or RU28362 (a specific type II receptor agonist) to adrenalectomized animals induced changes in leukocyte distribution.

25|$|Without {{derivative}} action, a PI-controlled {{system is}} less responsive to real (non-noise) and relatively fast alterations {{in state and}} so the system will be slower to reach <b>setpoint</b> and slower to respond to perturbations than a well-tuned PID system may be.|$|E
25|$|One {{distinctive}} {{advantage of}} PID controllers is that two PID controllers {{can be used}} together to yield better dynamic performance. This is called cascaded PID control. In cascade control there are two PIDs arranged with one PID controlling the <b>setpoint</b> of another. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as fluid level or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, which reads the output of outer loop controller as <b>setpoint,</b> usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, flowrate or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven that the working frequency of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using cascaded PID controllers..|$|E
25|$|Most {{commercial}} {{control systems}} offer {{the option of}} also basing the proportional action solely on the process variable. This means that only the integral action responds {{to changes in the}} <b>setpoint.</b> The modification to the algorithm does not affect the way the controller responds to process disturbances.|$|E
50|$|In engineering, {{mathematics}} and the physical, and biological sciences, common terms for the points {{around which the}} system gravitates include: attractors, stable states, eigenstates/eigenfunctions, equilibrium points, and <b>setpoints.</b>|$|R
40|$|Undesirable steady offsets result when a stationary, linear {{regulator}} using state feedback {{is subjected to}} constant disturbances and/or non-zero setspoints. To eliminate these offsets, the disturbances and non-zero <b>setpoints</b> can be fed forward to the control. Only {{when the number of}} outputs is {{less than or equal to}} the number of control inputs can the outputs be maintained at arbitrary non-zero <b>setpoints.</b> The state and the disturbance may be estimated using a constant gain Kalman filter or by modeling the constant disturbances as exponentially correlated processes with long correlation times...|$|R
50|$|The {{primary control}} {{provides}} the <b>setpoints</b> for a lower controller which are thevoltage and current control loops of DERs. These inner controlloops are {{commonly referred to}} as zero-level control.|$|R
25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater temperature <b>setpoint</b> and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this <b>setpoint.</b>|$|E
25|$|In this example, two {{variables}} {{that will be}} maintained within the loop are initialized to zero, then the loop begins. The current error is calculated by subtracting the measured_value (the process variable or PV) from the current <b>setpoint</b> (SP). Then, integral and derivative values are calculated and these and the error are combined with three preset gain terms – the proportional gain, the integral gain and the derivative gain – to derive an output value. In the real world, this is D-to-A converted and passed into the process under control as the manipulated variable (or MV). The current error is stored elsewhere for re-use in the next differentiation, the program then waits until dt seconds have passed since start, and the loop begins again, reading in new values for the PV and the <b>setpoint</b> and calculating a new value for the error.|$|E
25|$|Because a non-zero {{error is}} {{required}} to drive it, a proportional controller generally operates with a so-called steady-state error. Steady-state error (SSE) {{is proportional to the}} process gain and inversely proportional to proportional gain. SSE may be mitigated by adding a compensating bias term to the <b>setpoint</b> AND output, or corrected dynamically by adding an integral term.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new algorithm, which we call the cascaded parameter scan method, to efficiently carry out the scan over magnet parameters in the safety analysis for top-off injection in synchrotron radiation storage rings. In top-off safety analysis, one must track particles populating phase space through a beam line containing magnets and apertures and clearly demonstrate that, for all possible magnet settings and errors, all particles are lost on scrapers within the properly shielded region. In the usual approach, if one considers m magnets and scans each magnet through n <b>setpoints,</b> then one must carry out n^{m} tracking runs. In the cascaded parameter scan method, the number of tracking runs is reduced to n×m. This reduction of exponential to linear dependence {{on the number of}} <b>setpoints</b> n greatly reduces the required computation time and allows one to more densely populate phase space and to increase the number n of <b>setpoints</b> scanned for each magnet...|$|R
25|$|Generally, {{stabilization}} of response is required {{and the process}} must not oscillate for any combination of process conditions and <b>setpoints,</b> though sometimes marginal stability (bounded oscillation) is acceptable or desired.|$|R

In this paper, the effect of the data transfer delays in the communication system of future microgrids is investigated on the dynamic operation of the distributed energy resources...|$|R
