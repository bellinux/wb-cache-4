The character was complex; one that the whole audience loved, she was naive, gentle, and although <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would break men's hearts, {{for the most part}} it was her own heart that was broken."

60|$|She {{raised her}} face, {{she raised her}} hands, in blank amazement: <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> distrusted her own ears.|$|E

60|$|She {{sank into}} a chair before which she had been standing, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were going to swoon.|$|E
60|$|Eustacia made no reply, but <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{could say}} as much upon that subject as he if she chose.|$|E
6000|$|But <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> scarce followed. [...] "Why is it virtuous if--since she's free--there's {{nothing to}} impose on it any condition?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{voice in}} which she assented was hoarse and {{scarcely}} audible, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> twenty years had passed over her head.|$|R

6000|$|Oh, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{knew all}} about that! [...] "Awfully charming--mustn't it?--to act upon a person, through an affection, so deeply." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{sometimes}} {{thought of}} that too, but rather in a different way. [...] "Where other people, you mean, are concerned?" ...|$|E
60|$|The girl curtseyed, and sat down. She {{was very}} young, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were {{frightened by the}} matter-of-fact {{prospect}} the world afforded.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can hardly}} give an opinion until I have seen her. Does <b>she</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{might have been}} a pretty woman at one time of her life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so ye've {{had a baby}} left ye to {{keep you}} company? Lordy!" [...] Here <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> dangerously near a relapse, and then added, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in {{explanation}} of her conduct,-- ...|$|R

60|$|She listened without once speaking, {{but without}} {{apparent}} {{surprise at the}} confidence, though she may have felt surprised. At times <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> her thoughts were away from what he was saying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes. She has not shed a tear. She did {{not seem}} to hear what I was saying. I might have told her anything. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> no longer {{belonging}} to this world." ...|$|R
6000|$|...

6000|$|The two women's {{eyes met}} again, and Gwendolen said proudly, [...] "I will not {{interfere}} with your wishes." [...] <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were shivering, and her lips were pale.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, mother," [...] {{said the}} girl after a pause, in which <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a little weary of the subject, [...] "why {{do you worry about}} it? If it's to be it'll be, and if it isn't----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} see the heads of her top-gallant sails. She seems a ship {{steering}} to the southward, with as many kites flying as an Indiaman in the trades. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were carrying royal stun'-sails, sir." ...|$|R
60|$|Jenny's {{eyes were}} {{sparkling}} also, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> quite {{ready for the}} new scenes and excitements which the famous old city promised them, though she had private doubts as to whether anything could be more delightful than Scotland.|$|R
60|$|As he hastily {{wrenched}} {{open the}} door, she raised up her face, {{and he was}} shocked. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had lived years of sorrow, and even Maurice was struck with consternation.|$|E

50|$|Hélène finds a {{photograph}} of Victor in her husband's jacket pocket with his name and address on the back. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is going to confront him but she goes outside and burns it. Her emotions are difficult to read.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think so. At {{least she}} {{did not seem to}} cheer up as I should have {{expected}} when her brother grew better. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been nursing him too closely, and yet I see her walking a good deal.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} happy to be taught," [...] said Rosamond. [...] "But I am sure you admit that the {{interruption}} was a very beautiful one. I quite envy your acquaintance with Mrs. Casaubon. Is she very clever? <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were." ...|$|R
