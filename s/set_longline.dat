Such findings are enigmatic, and there are several possible explanations for the observed results (none of which are mutually exclusive) : (1) the assessments may not be correct (billfish abundance may not be as low as it is currently estimated to be); (2) deep <b>set</b> <b>longline</b> hooks may fish at shallower depths than estimated; (3) the majority of billfish may be taken as deep set longlines are deployed and retrieved (a longer time for the bait to be moving through the water column); or (4) billfish may preferentially feed at depth. In this paper we provide detailed time-at-depth information for two blue marlin released alive from pelagic longline gear with pop-up archival satellite tags (PSATs) programmed to release from the animals after 30 days. Both blue marlin made several dives each day. The fish moved quickly to depth, and the times at depth were greater than those spent in descent or ascent. The depth of dives was greater during daylight hours. These data are suggestive of feeding excursions to deeper waters, movements for which these fish are well adapted with large eyes and a brain (eye) heating organ. If billfish undertake specific feeding movements to depth, then one would expect increased catch rates for deeply <b>set</b> <b>longline</b> gear. Researchers have recently attempted to standardize catch rates of billfish on pelagic longline for the time fish spend at depth (habitat-based models).

40|$|The {{leatherback}} turtle is endangered in the Pacific Ocean and concern about their persistence has increased {{as a result}} of declines in nesting populations over the last three decades. Due to the extensive migratory nature and complex life history of this trans-boundary species, population recovery requires a coordinated international effort that will boost reproductive output on nesting beaches while ensuring maximum survival of juveniles and adults in the ocean. To reduce adult mortality in shallow <b>set</b> <b>longline</b> (SSLL) and drift gillnet (DGN) fisheries, the U. S. has implemented a series of measures restricting fishing activity. The implementation of these measures has come at great economic cost to the U. S. fishing industry. For example, there has been a 50 percent decline in both the number of vessels and annual revenue for the west coast swordfish DGN fishery. The conservation benefits of the U.

40|$|Incidental seabird {{mortality}} {{associated with}} bycatch during longline commercial fishing is a conservation concern. An initial step to estimating likelihood of seabird bycatch and conceiving conservation strategies is determining amount of overlap between foraging birds and commercial fishing effort, identifying oceanographic features associated with foraging birds, and quantifying dive characteristics. We tracked 24 adult flesh-footed shearwaters (Puffinus carneipes) breeding on Lord Howe Island located east of Australia during incubation and {{early and late}} chick-rearing periods from 6 January to 17 April 2005. At-sea foraging distribution of flesh-footed shearwaters was primarily confined within the jurisdictional Australian Fishing Zone. Foraging was strongly associated with sea-surface temperature > 248 degrees C. Spatial and temporal overlap of longline fishing with foraging shearwaters varied throughout the breeding season, but was greatest (63 % overlap) during early chick-rearing. Mean maximum distance reached from the breeding colony during a foraging event was 804 km (SD 280) from Lord Howe Island. Foraging behavior was strongly diurnal, with 91 % of dives occurring during daylight, and most dives (77 %) were < 5 m. Given that longline fishing and flesh-footed shearwaters overlap substantially, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority should consider implementing additional regulations to further reduce bycatch.

Based on proportions of eight species and three broader species groups in 46 961 <b>longline</b> <b>sets</b> from 4 years (1991 - 1994) of commercial fishery data, five effort clusters were identified. Spatial distribution of sets and differences in fishing operations among clusters were then compared to reveal apparent differences in fishing strategies. Three clusters comprised N 80 % of the total sets, and the catch compositions suggested targeting for either broadbill swordfish (two clusters) or bigeye tuna. The other two clusters were most similar to the tuna cluster, but their catch compositions indicated a mixed-species fishing strategy. Fishing operations were most different between sets in the tuna and swordfish clusters. Swordfish sets were characterized by (1) the largest vessels, (2) the least number of hooks per set, (3) the greatest number of lightsticks, (4) the longest set duration, (5) the highest percentage of night sets, (6) a larger percentage of sets within the full moon phase, and (7) the lowest percentage of sets within the main Hawaiian Islands Exclusive Economic Zone.

40|$|International audienceOdontocete {{depredation}} on longlines involves {{socioeconomic and}} conservation issues with significant losses for fisheries and potential impacts on wild populations of depredating species. As technical solutions to this conflict are limited {{and difficult to}} implement, this study aimed to identify fishing practices that could reduce odontocete depredation, {{with a focus on}} killer whales (Orcinus orca) interacting with Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) longliners off the Crozet islands. Data collected by fishery observers from 6013 <b>longline</b> <b>sets</b> between 2003 and 2013 allowed us to statistically detect the significant influence of five operational variables using GLMMs. The probability of interactions between vessels and killer whales was decreased by (i) the number of vessels operating simultaneously in the area: the limited number of depredating killer whales may induce a dilution effect with increased fleet size, and (ii) depth of longline sets: vessels operating in shallow waters may be more accessible to whales that are initially distributed on peri-insular shelves. The cpue was negatively influenced by (iii) length of longlines: longer sets may provide killer whales access to a greater proportion of hooked fish per set, and positively influenced by (iv) hauling speed: increased speed may shorten the time during which toothfish are accessible to whales during hauling. The time it takes for killer whales to reach vessels was positively correlated to (v) the distance travelled between <b>longline</b> <b>sets</b> with an estimated threshold of 100 km beyond which whales seem to temporarily lose track of vessels. These findings provide insightful guidelines about what fishing strategy to adopt given these variables to reduce killer whale depredation here and in similar situations elsewhere. To a greater extent, this study is illustrative of how collaborative work with fishermen in a fully controlled fishery framework may lead to the definition of cost-limited and easy-to-implement mitigation solutions when facing such human-wildlife conflict...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDepredation is a human–wildlife {{interaction}} over {{access to}} resources, which often includes {{a combination of}} socio-economic, ecological and conservation issues. However, estimating the amount of resource depredated can be especially challenging when depredation occurs on fish in the marine environment. This {{is the case for}} killer whales (Orcinus orca) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) depredation on the demersal Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) longline fishery operating within the Crozet Islands EEZ (southern Indian Ocean). This study aimed at providing two indirect methods of assessment of depredated biomass over an 11 -year period (2003 to 2013), accounting for spatial variations of depredation levels. In the first method, fishing data from 6 525 <b>longline</b> <b>sets</b> were used to calculate the difference between catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of non-depredated and depredated lines. When killer whales and sperm whales occurred separately, 575 ± 35 tonnes and 739 ± 87 tonnes of Patagonian toothfish respectively were estimated to be depredated by the two species. When the two species co-occurred around vessels, 1 679 ± 74 tonnes were depredated. The second method used the differences in the proportion of grenadiers (Macrourus spp.) between non-depredated and depredated <b>longline</b> <b>sets</b> to estimate the number of depredated Patagonian toothfish. This approach, which can only be implemented when a sufficient level of by-catch species occurs, provides comparable results and thus strong support for the CPUE method. From these two methods, depredation rates were estimated to range from 27. 3 % to 29. 1 % of the total catch (landed and depredated), {{which is one of the}} highest among all similar situations where depredation is reported elsewhere in the world. In addition to providing a methodology that could be used in other areas with depredation issues, these findings emphasise the critical importance for fishery managers and researchers to account for depredation when assessing fish stocks, fishery economics and/or conservation of odontocetes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{white and blue}} marlin catch data from the Brazilian {{commercial}} longline fishery, from 1980 to 2004, were analyzed. The catch per unit of effort (CPUE), {{as the number of}} fish caught per 100 hooks, was standardized by delta-log normal GLM, based on 53, 713 <b>longline</b> <b>sets.</b> The frequencies of zero catches were equal to 87. 0 % and 83. 4 % for white and blue marlin, respectively. The following factors were considered in the analyses: year, month, area, target species, moon phase, sea surface temperature (SST), and depth of the fishing ground. The total fishing ground, ranging from 7 oN to 50 oS, was divided into 2 areas, by the 15 oS of latitude. The target species was based on a cluster analysis done in a previous work, a...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{targeting}} in longline fisheries have major impacts on CPUE (catch per unit effort). To target large pelagic fishes in longline fisheries, fishermen deployed several tactics {{according to the}} target species. For a given species, the tactic depends on both the season and the fishing ground. One of major aims of the fishing tactic is to <b>set</b> the <b>longline</b> for optimizing the overlap between the distribution of hook depths and the supposed preferential vertical habitat of the target species. Thus, the maximum fishing depth (MFD) of the longline is recognized as a key parameter for estimating the distribution of hook depths and then to standardize fishing effort. In this context, the number of hooks per basket (HPB) is commonly used as a proxy indicator of MFD (this information has been collected for the Japanese longline fishery since 1975). Unfortunately HPB {{is not a good}} proxy indicator of MFD. In {{the first part of this}} work we illustrate why our previous affirmation is consistent from a theoretical point of view. Second, we analyse depth series recorded with time depth recorders (TRDs) at the deepest point of the mainline (data collected during instrumented longline experiments carried out in the French Polynesia EEZ, central South Pacific). We observe variations of depths recorded during the soak time and we compare the calculated mean depth of dept...|$|R

40|$|Seabirds {{scavenge}} baits {{from the}} hooks of commercial longlines, resulting in incidental seabird mortality and bait loss. As interactions between seabirds and longline fishing may cause decline in seabird populations and reduced gear efficiency, {{the potential for}} solving this problem by means of various mitigation measures has been tested. Four fishing experiments were conducted in commercial longlining in the north Atlantic to investigate {{the effectiveness of a}} bird-scaring line, underwater setting and a line shooter in reducing seabird bycatch during <b>longline</b> <b>setting.</b> These results are reviewed and the performance of the mitigation measures is evaluated. Accidental catches of birds were reduced by all three methods, most clearly by the bird-scaring line that had an efficiency of 98 - 100 %. The experiments also produced a reduction in bait loss and raised the catch rates of target species, which are important incentives for fishermen to employ mitigation measures...|$|R
