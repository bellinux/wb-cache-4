I am {{exceeding}} unhappy at our not joining at Weelind , but don't know that either of us are to blame, the militia with us continue to desert, and consequently I cannot remain long in one place otherways should be happy in forming a junction here.... I shall move on slowly for the reasons before recited and you will use the greatest industry as you cannot possibly pass us without our knowledge. I have suffered much lately but you again encourage me.|$|E

25|$|My dear friend, {{what is this}} our life? A {{boat that}} swims in the sea, and all one knows for certain {{about it is that}} one day it will capsize. Here we are, two good old boats that have been {{faithful}} neighbors, and above all your hand has done its best to keep me from 'capsizing'! Let us then continue our voyage -- each for the other's sake, for a long time yet, a long time! We should miss each other so much! Tolerably calm seas and good winds and above all sun -- what I wish for myself, I wish for you, too, and am <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> my gratitude can find expression only in such a wish and has no influence at all on wind or weather.|$|E
25|$|Sherman {{was able}} to {{concentrate}} his army faster than Beauregard had anticipated and arrived at Columbia {{on the afternoon of}} February 16. The only Confederates defending the city were small detachments from Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry corps, Maj. Gen. Matthew Butler's cavalry division, and Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee's corps from the Army of Tennessee. Heavily outnumbered, Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton ordered an evacuation of the city without a fight, although they destroyed all bridges over the Congaree and Saluda Rivers in an attempt to delay the Union forces. Sherman occupied Columbia the following day. Much of Columbia burned to the ground in a fire that has engendered controversy ever since: some say it started when the Confederates set fire to cotton bales in the city, others say that drunken Union soldiers were fanning the flames of vengeance, while a few witnesses claimed that some of the fires were by accident. James W. Loewen researched the topic for his book, Lies Across America, and found that most likely, the cotton bale fires spread and caused most of the destruction. He did find that there were some fires started by Union soldiers, but the effects of these were minimal. Most likely, the Confederates' scorched earth policy was to blame for the burning of Columbia (in which not much of it burned). After the burning, Sherman was quoted as saying that he never gave the order to burn Columbia to the ground but he was not <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> it happened.|$|E
500|$|On August 14, Manning {{apologized to}} the court: [...] "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> my actions hurt people. I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> they hurt the United States.

500|$|Obama's {{previous}} unambiguous {{assurance that}} consumers' could keep their own plans became {{a focal point}} for critics, who challenged his truthfulness. On November 7, 2013, President Obama stated: [...] "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> [...] are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me." [...] Various bills were introduced in Congress to allow people to keep their plans.|$|E

[...] Keating wins and Howard concedes with the line [...] "Well, I'm <b>sorry...</b> <b>that</b> I lost!" [...] (a reference to his unwillingness to support a formal apology to the Aboriginal people). [...] As the song's title indicates, the actual Keating did not win the 1996 election. [...] The song segues into a reprise of [...] "Ruler Of The Land".|$|E

So I said, 'Let's {{do it in the}} desert, it'll be warm,' and it would be sort of the opposite, because even though you think of deserts as being hot, they're still sort of frozen in terms of there's no vegetation and they're very desolate. I thought that that would still work as a visual, but then we got there and it was like 20 degrees below zero, it was bitterly cold, and I was barefoot. I was barefoot for the entire video, and then it started pouring rain and everyone got really sick, and it just actually {{turned out to be a}} really miserable experience.|$|E
500|$|Many {{survivors}} of the tragedy refused to blame anyone. Survivor John Jacques wrote, [...] "I blame nobody. I am not anxious to blame anybody... I {{have no doubt that}} those who had to do with its management meant well and tried to do the best they could under the circumstances." [...] Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, [...] "Was I <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> I chose to come by hand cart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Hand Cart Company." [...] On the other hand, survivor John Chislett, who later left the Church, wrote bitterly of Richards promising them that [...] "we should get to Zion in safety." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of Tallard's retreating troops headed for Höchstädt but most {{did not make}} the safety of the town, plunging instead into the Danube where upwards of 3,000 French horsemen drowned; others were cut down by the pursuing cavalry. The Marquis de Gruignan attempted a counter-attack, but he was easily brushed aside by the triumphant Allies. After a final rally behind his camp's tents, shouting entreaties to stand and fight, Marshal Tallard was caught up in the rout and pushed towards Sonderheim. Surrounded by a squadron of Hessian troops, Tallard surrendered to Lieutenant-Colonel de Boinenburg, the Prince of Hesse-Kassel's aide-de-camp, and was sent under escort to Marlborough. The Duke welcomed the French commander – [...] "I am very <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> such a cruel misfortune should have fallen upon a soldier for whom I have the highest regard." [...] With salutes and courtesies, the Marshal was escorted to Marlborough's coach.|$|E

5000|$|The {{programme}} allowed Isaacs {{to realise}} {{one of his}} longest-held ambitions. [...] "When I first started in television at Granada...

500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E
500|$|Megan Fox was {{originally}} {{attached to the}} film, and Patrick Dempsey's role as Dylan Gould {{was to be the}} employer of Fox's character, Mikaela Banes. According to various published sources, Fox's absence from the film was due to Bay ultimately choosing not to renew her role in light of her comparing him and his work ethics to Adolf Hitler, although representatives for the actress said that it was her decision to leave the film franchise. Bay later claimed that Fox was fired by executive producer Steven Spielberg, a claim which Spielberg denied. [...] "I wasn't hurt", Bay stated, [...] "because I know that's just Megan. Megan loves to get a response. And she does it in kind of the wrong way. I'm sorry, Megan. I'm sorry I made you work twelve hours. I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> I'm making you show up on time.

500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Radio Times {{reviewer}} Alison Graham {{felt the}} episode didn't {{live up to}} the original Law & Orders pacing, saying {{that it could have been}} accomplished in half the time taken. She also didn't care for the story, saying [...] "it falls headfirst into a typically British legal-drama trap of the noble prosecutor ... crusading to bring the guilty to justice while pitted against the louche, self-serving defence barrister .... No, <b>sorry,</b> <b>that's</b> just too cliched. And wrong." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Movin' Out (Brian's Song)" [...] {{was written}} by series regular John Viener and {{directed}} by series regular Cyndi Tang. Brian's girlfriend Jillian was introduced in season five and this episode {{marked the end of}} what the staff called [...] "the Jillian arc". Executive producer David A. Goodman praised Drew Barrymore's voice work as Jillian, saying that [...] "she did such an amazing job with the voice", and was <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> this was her final episode. The episode was at the time the only Family Guy episode to list the executive producer credits {{at the end of the}} episode, because MacFarlane wanted [...] "to wrap it up in kind of a sad way and do it the old-fashioned way." [...] In the original draft of the episode, Jillian had moved in with Quagmire at the end. It was later changed to Jesus, and then to Mayor West, which was kept for the episode.|$|E
500|$|While {{performing}} at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and [...] "bear-hugged" [...] Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. [...] The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar {{was taken away}} by security. [...] After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. [...] Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. [...] Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: [...] "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply {{had too much to}} drink and made a very bad decision. [...] If I had been in Mike's place, I am sure I would have acted similarly. My heart goes out to him and I hope he recovers quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|Giuseppe Conlon, Sarah's husband, {{was convicted}} in 1976 along with six members of the Maguire family (the seven being dubbed the Maguire Seven) of running an IRA bomb factory in North London, {{on the basis of}} {{forensic}} evidence. Each was sentenced to up to 14 years in jail, served their sentences, and with the exception of Giuseppe Conlon who died in 1980, were released. The Maguire Seven's first appeal, in 1977, was turned down, but a later appeal, prompted by the release of the Guildford Four, found that test kits used to detect traces of explosives had been contaminated. In 1991, the Court of Appeal quashed their convictions after it was ruled the original evidence against them was unsafe. On 9 February 2005, then Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a public apology to the Maguire Seven and the Guildford Four for the miscarriages of justice they had suffered, saying that he was [...] "very <b>sorry</b> <b>that</b> they were subject to such an ordeal and such an injustice", and that [...] "they deserve to be completely and publicly exonerated." ...|$|E
