50|$|Introduction - Multiple disk {{clutches}} {{are used}} to deliver extremely high torque in a relatively small space. These clutches can be used dry or wet (oil bath). Running the clutches in an oil bath also greatly increases the heat dissipation capability, which makes them ideally suited for multiple <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> and machine tool applications.|$|R
5000|$|... 336 340ci engines plus 4 <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> were {{imported}} by Colin Adey under direct {{instructions from}} Chrysler Chief Engineer Walt McPherson. Chrysler General Manager David Brown and Walt McPherson had discussed the short comings of the E49 265ci and decided the 340ci {{was to be}} the next R/T Touring Car. This information never filtered down to John Ellis.|$|R
50|$|Power was {{delivered}} to the rear-wheels via a four <b>speed</b> manual <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b> The suspension used traditional leaf springs all round.|$|R
50|$|In most respects, the {{principal}} mechanical elements followed conventional practice. The four <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> featured synchromesh {{on the top}} two ratios. Stopping power came from drum-brakes on all four wheels.|$|E
5000|$|Like the 125, the 132 {{came with}} a five <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box,</b> {{optional}} in some markets and standard in others: this was still a relatively unusual feature in this class of car in 1977. GM [...] "Strasbourg" [...] automatic transmission was listed as an option.|$|E
50|$|After the war Claveau began {{promoting}} his new “Claveau Déscartes”, with an advanced 2292 cc 85 hp V8 motor, a five <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> and front wheel drive. Claveau presented a 1 to 5 scale {{model of the}} Descartes in a perspex box at the 1947 Paris Motor Show.|$|E

50|$|The Fidia, {{like other}} Iso cars, was {{originally}} {{powered by a}} Chevrolet V8 engine, and was quite quick off the line (0-60 in around 7 seconds). By 1973, after General Motors demanded payment in advance of shipment, the engine supplier had been switched and cars were delivered with a Ford 5.8 litre V8, matched with a ZF five <b>speed</b> manual <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> or with Ford's own 'Cruise-O-Matic' automatic <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the graphic}} {{theory and the}} design method of {{classification}} model, a new method of optimum design of drive project in lathe speed-change system is proposed. The mathematical model and optimum method are set up. This method {{can be used to}} design <b>speed</b> changing <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> of the lathe.

50|$|Advanced {{features}} included independent front suspension, a four <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box,</b> hydraulically controlled {{drum brakes}} {{on all four}} wheels and a twelve volt electrical system. The Simca 5 also offered exceptional fuel economy (in a test it managed to travel 110 kilometers on just 5 litres of fuel).|$|E
50|$|Former Isle of Man TT winner George Beale set up George Beale Motorcycles in Coleorton, Leicestershire {{to make a}} {{range of}} replica motorcycles, {{including}} Matchless G50 racing motorcycles to a high specification which includes a special lightweight frame and swing arm, Ceriani forks and a magnesium six <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> with lightweight clutch.|$|E
50|$|From 1955 {{the little}} A106 started to {{accumulate}} {{a succession of}} victories, and various performance enhancing options were offered such as “Mille Miles (Mille Miglia) suspension” following A106 participation in the eponymous race. The Mille Miles specifications involve using four shock absorbers at the back, and was the suspension system later used for the Renault 8 Gordini. Also offered was a five speed manual gear box manufactured under license: a five <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> in a road car of this class was almost unheard of, and since the gearbox option alone came with a price tag sufficient to purchase 35% of a Renault 4CV, Alpine A106s incorporating the five <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> option remained rare. In 1956 Jean Claude Galtier and Maurice Michy achieved a podium place and class victory for the A106 in the Mille Miglia race.|$|E
5000|$|After deliberation, the {{management}} rejected Bonsch's proposal and instead ordered chief engineer Fritz Fiedler to commission Bertone {{to design and}} manufacture a coupe body for the 3200S. [...] This used a perimeter frame, a , twin-carburetor version of the BMW OHV V8 engine, delivering , [...] a four <b>speed</b> manual <b>gear</b> <b>box,</b> a live rear axle, disc brakes on the front wheels, and torsion bar springs at all four wheels.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{introduces}} an idea {{which adds}} itself into contribution of getting best fuel economy of a passenger car {{when it is}} running at high speed on a highway. A six <b>speed</b> (forward) <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> is addressed in the paper which is controlled manually and automatically as well. The paper introduces an advancement in manual transmission <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> for passenger cars. Hydraulic circuit is designed with mechatronics {{point of view and}} resulting in making the shifting of gear automatically. A computational design is made of the Hybrid <b>Gear</b> <b>Box</b> (HGB) using CATIA P 3 V 5 as a designing software.

5000|$|The {{original}} Typ P {{was made}} from 1928 to 1929 and was available as a convertible or a roadster. The engine produced [...] and the car {{was referred to as}} the DKW P15 as a result. Power was transmitted via a three <b>speed</b> manual <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> to the rear wheels. Even at this stage the mechanically operated foot brake worked on all four wheels: the handbrake operated on the front leftside wheel and on the rear rightside wheel.|$|R
50|$|Power was {{delivered}} to the rear wheels via a three speed manual transmission with synchromesh on the upper two ratios. For a supplement of 200 New Francs customers could instead specify a four speed transmission on the slightly heavier coupé version of the car. Having regard to the car's power-to-weight ratio most customers chose to pay extra for the four <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
50|$|Volvo soon {{realized}} that the company's first four-cylinder side-valve engine simply wasn’t powerful enough so the company brought out a more powerful six-cylinder engine for its automobiles and trucks. The new LV60 truck {{was introduced in the}} summer of 1929. Apart from the larger engine and a four <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> it was identical to its predecessor, the LV Series 2.|$|E
5000|$|The six {{cylinder}} side-valve 2,540 cc engine [...] {{drove the}} rear wheels through a three <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> and provided a claimed maximum output of [...] at 3,000 rpm. The figures 10/45 in the car’s name referred respectively to the Tax horsepower (on which car tax was based till 1928) and actual horsepower in PS (i.e. applying the German standard formula).|$|E

50|$|The Isabella {{featured}} a swing axle at the back: it {{was supported by}} coil springs on all four wheels. The four-cylinder 1493 cc engine had a claimed power output of , and was connected {{by means of a}} then innovative hydraulic clutch to the four <b>speed</b> full synchromesh <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b> <b>Gear</b> changes were effected by means of a column mounted lever.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} again a 2- {{cylinder}} 2-stroke in-line 692cc unit producing a claimed maximum output of 15 kW (20 PS) at 3,500 rpm. Power was {{transmitted to the}} front wheels through a three <b>speed</b> manual <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> which was also carried over from the previous model, the gear ratios still unchanged {{from the days of}} the DKW F1. However, the F2 Meisterklasse, during its final year of production, had acquired a lockable freewheel device incorporated within its transmission, and this feature was carried forward to the F4 Meisterklasse.|$|R
5000|$|The column-mounted {{gear change}} {{controlled}} a four-speed manual gear box: power {{was delivered to}} the rear wheels using a propeller shaft driving through a worm-and-wheel gearset at the differential. Possibly the most significant upgrade occurred in March 1954 with a new the four <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> featuring synchromesh on all forward speeds. [...] Cars delivered between 1949 and 1954 came without synchromesh on the bottom ratio.|$|E
50|$|The 149 {{estate cars}} {{delivered}} between 1942 and 1943 all used the smaller older engine and other mechanical elements from the B38. However, {{a small number}} of B67 engined Compounds were also produced during the war years. These featured a simplified but more robust three <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> in place of the four speed unit that had come with the B38 Compound, along with a suitably strengthened clutch.|$|E

5000|$|The only {{model was}} a small four-wheeled vehicle with a {{relatively}} wide track at the front and a narrow track at the rear. The vehicle offered space for two, seated one behind the other, following the same basic lay-out as the better known Messerschmitt “Bubble-car”. Weather protection came from a hood which could be partially opened to expose only the driver to the weather (in a style dubbed [...] "a la Milord" [...] {{by at least one}} commentator) or fully folded back if the passenger in the back also wished to travel roofless. A single-cylinder engine from AMC or Ydral of 175 cc or 125 cc powered the rear axle via a three <b>speed</b> manual <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> and a chain drive mechanism.|$|R
50|$|It was {{powered by}} a single {{cylinder}} 260 cc air cooled four stroke engine. The engine's small size placed {{the car in the}} 2CV fiscal horse power category, and actual claimed power was only 6.5 hp. Supported by a three <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box,</b> this permitted the manufacturer to claim a top speed of 70 km/h (44 mph). There were no doors, and the focus of sloping front of the car was a single headlight.|$|E
50|$|Subaru Tecnica International Inc. was {{established}} in 1988 by Fuji Heavy Industries to overtake all Subaru’s motorsport activities and participate in rally championships. Subaru’s first performance model was the Subaru Legacy Turbo, which featured a 2 liter turbo engine producing 240 horsepower mated to a five <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> and weighing just over 2,600 pounds. The vehicle had {{a top speed of}} 155 miles per hour, which was considered ‘’Extremely powerful’’ at the time.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1933 {{power was}} {{increased}} to [...] at 3500 rpm, and the maximum speed went up to 85 km/h (53 mph). Transmission was upgraded to a four <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b> For 1934 the car now came with a slightly more aerodynamic looking [...] "berlina" [...] (saloon/sedan) body, available with either two or four doors.

5000|$|Power was {{delivered}} to the front wheels from a transversely mounted air-cooled twin cylinder two-stroke engine with a horizontal-flow Solex 30 BFRH carburetor. [...] The engine capacity of 293cc provided for a maximum power output of 10 PS (6.5 kW) at 4,000 rpm. The top speed listed was 75 km/h (46 mph). [...] The car was fueled using [...] "regular" [...] grade petrol/gasoline, mixed in the ratio of 25:1 with oil, reflecting {{the requirements of the}} [...] "motorbike-style" [...] two-stroke engine. When driven normally the Lloyd 300 consumed fuel significantly more frugally than West Germany's best selling small car, the Volkswagen. [...] Space was at a premium and the 18 litre fuel tank was accommodated ahead of the bulkhead underneath the front hood/bonnet in a space shared with the engine and the six-volt battery. Power was fed to the front wheels via a three <b>speed</b> manual <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> (without synchromesh).|$|R
