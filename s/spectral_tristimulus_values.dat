40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} to calibrate tristimulus colorimeters for high accuracy color measurements. Instead of traditional lamp standards, modern, high accuracy detector standards are suggested for calibra-tion. After high accuracy absolute spec-tral response {{determination of the}} tristimu-lus receivers, color (spectral) correction and peak (amplitude) normalization can minimize uncertainties caused by imper-fect realizations of the Commission Interna-tionale de l’Eclairage (CIE) color match-ing functions. As {{a result of the}} corrections, stable light sources of different spectral power distributions can be measured with an accuracy dominated by the sub tenths of a percent uncertainty of novel spectral response determinations. Key words: chromaticity coordinates; color calibration; color temperature; col-orimetry; detector standard; photometry; <b>spectral</b> response; <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{color space}} maps {{a range of}} {{physically}} produced colors (from mixed light, pigments, etc.) to an objective description of color sensations registered in the eye, typically in terms of <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values,</b> but not usually in the LMS space defined by the cone <b>spectral</b> sensitivities. The <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> associated with a color space can be conceptualized as amounts of three primary colors in a tri-chromatic additive color model. In some color spaces, including LMS and XYZ spaces, the primary colors used are not real colors, {{in the sense that}} they cannot be generated with any light spectrum.|$|R
5000|$|Illuminants B and C {{are easily}} {{achieved}} daylight simulations. They modify Illuminant A by using liquid filters. B {{served as a}} representative of noon sunlight, with a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 4874 K, while C represented average day light with a CCT of 6774 K. Unfortunately, they are poor approximations of any phase of natural daylight, particularly in the short-wave visible and in the ultraviolet spectral ranges. Once more realistic simulations were achievable, Illuminants B & C were deprecated in favor of the D series:. Lighting cabinets, such as the Spectralight III, that use filtered incandescent lamps have better fits to the D illuminants in the 400 nm to 700 nm range than do the fluorescent daylight simulators. [...] Illuminant C does not have the status of CIE standard illuminants but its relative <b>spectral</b> power distribution, <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> and chromaticity coordinates are given in Table T.1 and Table T.3, as many practical measurement instruments and calculations still use this illuminant.

50|$|However, the XYZ color model presupposes {{specific}} viewing conditions (such as the retinal {{locus of}} stimulation, the luminance {{level of the}} light that meets the eye, the background behind the observed object, and the luminance level of the surrounding light). Only if all these conditions stay constant will two identical stimuli with thereby identical XYZ <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> create an identical color appearance for a human observer. If some conditions change in one case, two identical stimuli with thereby identical XYZ <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> will create different color appearances (and vice versa: two different stimuli with thereby different XYZ <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> might create an identical color appearance).|$|R
5000|$|All <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> are {{normally}} calculated using the CIE 1931 2° standard colorimetric observer.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, if the {{reference}} white in both illuminants have the Y <b>tristimulus</b> <b>value</b> (...) then: ...|$|R
50|$|CIECAM02 {{takes for}} its input the <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> of the stimulus, the <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> of an {{adapting}} white point, adapting background, and surround luminance information, {{and whether or}} not observers are discounting the illuminant (color constancy is in effect). The model can be used to predict these appearance attributes or, with forward and reverse implementations for distinct viewing conditions, to compute corresponding colors.|$|R
50|$|Chromatic {{adaptation}} is a {{prime example}} for the case that two different stimuli with thereby different XYZ <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> create an identical color appearance. If the color temperature of the illuminating light source changes, so do the spectral power distribution and thereby the XYZ <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> of the light reflected from the white paper; the color appearance, however, stays the same (white).|$|R
50|$|Therefore, a {{white with}} equi-energy lights of 1.000 + 4.5907 + 0.0601 = 5.6508 lm can be matched by mixing {{together}} R, G and B. Guild and Wright used 17 subjects to determine RGB color matching functions. RGB color matching {{serve as the}} base for rg chromaticity. The RGB color matching functions are {{used to determine the}} <b>tristimulus</b> RGB <b>values</b> for a spectrum. Normalizing the RGB <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> converts the <b>tristimulus</b> into rgb. Normalized RGB <b>tristimulus</b> <b>value</b> can be plotted on an rg chromaticity diagram.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{challenge}} for any color appearance model is that human color perception {{does not work}} in terms of XYZ <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values,</b> {{but in terms of}} appearance parameters (hue, lightness, brightness, chroma, colorfulness and saturation). So any color appearance model needs to provide transformations (which factor in viewing conditions) from the XYZ <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> to these appearance parameters (at least hue, lightness and chroma).|$|R

25|$|The CIE XYZ {{color space}} {{encompasses}} all color sensations that are visible {{to a person}} with average eyesight. That is why CIE XYZ (<b>Tristimulus</b> <b>values)</b> is a device-invariant representation of color. It serves as a standard reference against which many other color spaces are defined. A set of color-matching functions, like the spectral sensitivity curves of the LMS color space, but not restricted to non-negative sensitivities, associates physically produced light spectra with specific <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values.</b>|$|R
50|$|Metamerism: Wyszecki {{introduced}} the important concept of ‘metameric blacks,’ psychophysical definitions of blacks with <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> 0, 0, 0 that within limits {{can be added}} to a spectral reflectance to form the various possible metamers (with an identical set of <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values)</b> under a given light. With W.S. Stiles he also developed mathematical methods to calculate by various methodologies the number of possible metamers for given chromaticities, peaking at the achromatic colors.|$|R

2500|$|Most {{wavelengths}} stimulate two or {{all three}} kinds of cone cell because the spectral sensitivity curves of the three kinds overlap.
