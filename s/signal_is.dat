5|$|Some active subwoofers use a servo {{feedback}} mechanism {{based on}} cone movement which modifies the signal {{sent to the}} voice coil. The servo feedback <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> derived from {{a comparison of the}} input signal to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> a few turns of voice coil attached to the cone or a microchip-based accelerometer placed on the cone itself. An advantage of a well-implemented servo subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.|$|E
5|$|Another pursuit-deterrent <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> {{thanatosis}} {{or playing}} dead. Thanatosis {{is a form}} of bluff in which an animal mimics its own dead body, feigning death to avoid being attacked by predators seeking live prey. Thanatosis can also be used by the predator in order to lure prey into approaching.|$|E
5|$|Decimetric radio {{emission}} (with wavelengths measured in centimeters) was first observed by Frank Drake and Hein Hvatum in 1959. The origin of this signal {{was from a}} torus-shaped belt around Jupiter's equator.

40|$|Static <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> by {{definition}} unchanging {{over a long}} period of time. Such <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> essentially DC levels, while quasi-static <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> those that change very slowly such as the drift on a sensor. 2. 1. 2. Periodic and Repetitive <b>Signals</b> Periodic <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> those that repeat themselves on a regular basis. These include sine, square and sawtooth waves. Their nature is such that each waveform <b>is</b> identical. Repetitive <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> periodic in nature, but the exact shape may change slightly with time. ECG <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> an example of this type. 2. 1. 3. Transient and Quasi Transient <b>Signals</b> Transient <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> either one time only signals while quasi-transient <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> those which are periodic but with a duration which is very short compared to the period of the waveform.

5|$|One {{class of}} honest <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E
5|$|One type of inter-cellular {{communication}} by {{a molecular}} <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> called quorum sensing, which serves {{the purpose of}} determining {{whether there is a}} local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, as in excreting digestive enzymes or emitting light.|$|E

5|$|Aposematism (from Greek ἀπό apo away, σῆμα sema sign) was a {{new term}} coined by Edward Bagnall Poulton for Alfred Russel Wallace's concept of warning coloration. It {{describes}} a family of antipredator adaptations in which a warning <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> associated with the unprofitability of a prey item to potential predators. Aposematism always involves an advertising signal. The warning signal may {{take the form of}} conspicuous animal coloration, sounds, odours or other perceivable characteristics. Aposematic signals are beneficial for both the predator and prey, since both avoid potential harm.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{timing offset}} (BTO) — The time {{difference}} between when a <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> sent {{from the ground}} station and when the response is received. This measure is twice {{the distance from the}} ground station to satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station (the latter two times are constant and can be calculated and removed). This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance.|$|E
