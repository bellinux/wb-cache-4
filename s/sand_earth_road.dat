40|$|A {{study has}} been carried out to gather, review, {{summarize}} literature in order to prepare a set of recommendation tor design and maintenance of gravel road for Sri Lanka, Paved roads are all weather while <b>earth</b> <b>roads</b> are not. The cost of construction and maintenance of paved roads are very high compared to <b>earth</b> <b>roads.</b> A need has always been there for all weather gravel roads {{to bridge the gap between}} paved <b>roads</b> and <b>earth</b> <b>roads,</b> in order to accommodate low volume of traffic on agricultural and rural roads. In this study, the available literature and practices were studied and revived by the author. who has considerable field experience in this subject, spanning a period of about two decades. It was possible after the study to present suitable recommendations, for most required items in design and maintenance of gravel roads. The surveys carried out reveal that magnitude of traffic and their composition can be accommodated with suitably designed, constructed and maintained gravel roads. The outcome of the study presents recommendations on selection of sites for gravel roads, essential geometric standards, drainage, selection of material, design procedure for pavement structure, maintenance requirements, items of maintenance and their frequencies, and the cost aspects of construction and maintenance. The study of cost aspect reveal that the gravel roads require one third of the cost that would require for traditional bitumen surfaced aggregate base (metaled and tarred) roads. Maintenance of gravel roads could be carried out on self-help basis. This would further help to bridge the gap with respect to cost, between traditional paved <b>roads</b> and <b>earth</b> <b>roads...</b>|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. Terragrader (Pty) Ltd {{developed}} a working prototype for a machine {{capable of making}} and upgrading <b>earth</b> <b>roads.</b> The working prototype was based on practical engineering sense and any available components {{in order to produce}} a “concept proving” machine. As a consequence, a new working prototype was required which would include sound mechanical engineering design to address mass production requirements and any operational and maintenance issues. To achieve a sound prototype design, extensive research regarding <b>earth</b> <b>road</b> construction and maintenance was conducted. This dissertation documents the design and development of the new working prototype for a machine which will mechanically refurbish existing <b>earth</b> <b>roads</b> or create new <b>earth</b> <b>roads</b> in rural or informal areas in South Africa. The concept consists of a wheeled machine towed behind a commercial tractor. The tractor will provide the pulling force required to: • tear up (scarify) the existing earth road/ground. • grade and form the road shape. • stabilize the formed <b>earth</b> <b>road</b> by light compacting. The hydraulic pressure needed to actuate the machine is provided by the hydraulic power system integrated into the tractor. The machine will require a tractor driver, and one operator sitting {{at the rear of the}} machine. From this position the operator is able to observe and control every aspect of the <b>earth</b> <b>road</b> manufacturing process. It is envisaged that the production machine will be operated and maintained by semi skilled/unskilled workers, therefore, the new production working prototype must take this into account. The project, when implemented by Terragrader (Pty) Ltd will include training and instruction on the use and maintenance of the production machine. The research part of the project was done within several complimentary fields to gain a full understanding of the design requirements and constraints. The following complimentary fields were researched: • To determine the requirements of <b>earth</b> <b>road</b> design in South Africa, • To understand the make up of the earth conditions in South Africa, the types of road defects, the repair and construction methods applied in South Africa. • The amount of pulling force required to perform a grading, scarifying and compacting operation. As a consequence, a number of formulae and recommendations were identified and were utilized to quantify the pulling force required, thereby confirming that the tractor chosen by Terragrader (Pty) Ltd was adequate. • The types of existing road construction machinery have been researched and documented. A survey of the current commercially available earth construction machinery, in particular Graders, has been conducted to identify operating capacities, and compare these with the design criteria as specified. • Since the first working prototype was based on “engineering sense” only, mechanical engineering design practice was used to ensure that all initial design shortcomings and deficiencies were addressed to facilitate mass production, operation and maintenance. As this dissertation is being completed, the new production working prototype is being manufactured and any difficulties or improvements are being addressed and integrated into the design. The manufacturing of this second prototype will be completed towards the end of 2007, with the design finalization taking place once the prototype testing is completed...|$|R

The pavers would eliminate the problems on such roads of being waterlogged and impassible {{during the rainy season}} months and those of environmental and health hazards from raised dust during the dry season months. Three clay soils were investigated in the Ado region of Western Nigeria. Burnt brick pavers were produced using entirely traditional methods readily available in the indigent and rural environments. The engineering properties of the brick pavers were determined and it was found that they satisfied the requirements stipulated by ASTM C 902 Specification for Pedestrian and Light Traffic Paving Brick, thus making them suitable for usage on the <b>earth</b> <b>roads...</b>|$|R
