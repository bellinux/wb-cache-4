The company specializes in printing for packaging. The company closes during the Second World War and after the war, when in 1960 Wim Joos takes over the management, the company specializes in printing forms for administration (rotary printing). In 1991 the company is completely destroyed in a fire, but is being rebuilt within a year. In 1999 Alex and Yves Joos take over the management of the company from their father. In 2002 the company expands its business to become a Document Management company.|$|E

40|$|For this research, {{the image}} quality {{attributes}} of offset printing versus screen printing methods for providing high-resolution premium products, such as plastic key chains, were investigated. The three substrates investigated were Polypropylene (PP), Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and Polyester (PET). Optical properties, such as dot gain, solid ink density, ink trapping, tone reproduction and print contrast, were analyzed through color measurement and visual evaluation. In addition, the end-use applications were tested using adhesion tests, water resistance tests, and heat resistance tests {{to make certain}} that the final product achieve the best quality print and meets end-use requirements. The results of this research showed that offset printing can be used in place of screen printing to produce premium products. According to the research results, solid ink density, ink trapping, and print contrast on screen <b>printed</b> <b>sheets</b> show better results than offset <b>printed</b> <b>sheets.</b> However, the screen <b>printed</b> <b>sheets</b> had lower dot gain results than the offset <b>printed</b> <b>sheets.</b> Although the screen <b>printed</b> <b>sheets</b> appeared to give better optical properties than the offset <b>printed</b> <b>sheet,</b> the tone reproduction curves showed that the offset <b>printed</b> <b>sheet</b> had better visual image quality than the screen <b>printed</b> <b>sheet.</b> The results of the survey, which asked candidates to compare two images (screen <b>printed</b> <b>sheet</b> vs. offset <b>printed</b> <b>sheet),</b> showed {{that the majority of the}} people chose the offset <b>printed</b> <b>sheet</b> more often than the screen <b>printed</b> <b>sheet.</b> This also supports the results of the tone reproduction curves which show that the offset <b>printed</b> <b>sheet</b> produced a higher image quality than the screen <b>printed</b> <b>sheet.</b> The results of the application tests determined that the offset <b>printed</b> <b>sheet</b> withstood all three tests while the screen <b>printed</b> <b>sheet</b> failed the water resistance tests and the adhesion tests...|$|R

The classification can clearly detect the presence of certain technological features of printing machines or analyze the compatibility of some design decisions.

40|$|The article {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of changing the characteristics of paper sheets {{in the process of}} printed products delivering in sheetfed printing machines. Modern printing machines are characterized by high speed, increased colorfulness, ability to print on different materials and should ensure that transfer of sheets and formation of high-quality pile over the whole speed range. Transportation of a sheet at high speeds is accompanied by a significant aerodynamics load on its surface, the effect of which is particularly evident in the transition from the straight sections of sheets on curved ones when the sheet is aimed by inertia to keep its original direction of movement, where its corrugation occurs. Existing designs of <b>sheet</b> <b>printing</b> machines and delivery stocks for the use of flat forms of paper sheets which have certain mechanical properties (elastic modulus, the deformation properties, Poisson?s ratio, etc.) and are characterized by low stiffness. Low stiffness requires the application to the sheet to stabilize the motion of stretching efforts. But actually on an act as tensile and compressive forces, which significantly reduces its stability and is a factor of the output speed limit. It is known that change {{in the form of a}} paper sheet leads to a change in its strength characteristics. When you change the shape of the sheet in the direction of the flat on the bulk, stiffness of the sheet can be increased, which will affect its output speed. The ability to control the process by changing the shape of curvature of the sheet acquires particular significance in this case, which is important in sealing of various materials. ??????????? ??????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ? ???????? ?????? ??????????? ????????? ?? ???????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ?????...|$|E
