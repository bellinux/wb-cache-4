The object of this study are OJK and BPSK as a supervision of a <b>standard</b> <b>clause.</b> The result of this research shows that the supervision of <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> done by those institutions has not been effective yet, this caused by several factors to wit the weakness of implementing regulation in terms of supervision, unclear supervision mechanism, the weakness of socialization related to the rules of <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> towards business actors, and other weakness and obstacles faced by both institutions. The effective supervision model of <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> is being formed that based on five points, namely: (1) the needs of institution/agency reformation who authorize to do supervision of standard clause; (2) the needs to determine the scope of duty and authority of <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> supervision institution; (3) the needs of determination of material range about <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> subjected to supervision which comprises: the content, the form, the position and the expression; (4) the needs of precise mechanism of <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> supervision conducted by supervision institution; (5) the needs of following up the supervision results, especially to the business actors who break the <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> rules...|$|R
40|$|In {{the darkest}} depths of a {{corporate}} merger agreement lies the MAC clause, a term that permits the acquirer {{to walk away from}} a transaction if, between signing and closing, the target company experiences a 2 ̆ 2 Material Adverse Change. 2 ̆ 2 Multibillion-dollar deals rise or fall based on the anticipated interpretation of a MAC clause, and invocation of the clause in a sensitive transaction could trigger the collapse of the global financial system. In short, the MAC clause is the most important contract term of our time. And yet [...] due to an almost total lack of case law [...] no one knows what it means. In this Article I explain the MAC clause using a new conceptual tool for drafting and interpreting contracts, the 2 ̆ 2 <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> analysis. 2 ̆ 2 For any default rule of contract law, practitioners can be expected to develop a 2 ̆ 2 <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> analog 2 ̆ 2 in order to easily contract around the default. Given this relationship between default rules and their <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> analogs, if one is given, the other can be deduced. This is the 2 ̆ 2 <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> analysis, 2 ̆ 2 and it can be used in two ways, which I call 2 ̆ 2 forward 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 reverse. 2 ̆ 2 In a forward <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> analysis, one begins with a default rule and advances to its <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> analog. The forward <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> analysis can be used to predict the existence of <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> analogs that have yet to be observed. And in a reverse <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> analysis, one begins with a <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> and advances to the default rule with which it is associated. The reverse analysis is a powerful method for interpreting contract terms. After introducing and describing the <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> analysis, I put it to practical use. I begin by applying the forward analysis to the common law doctrine of frustration, and predict that a 2 ̆ 2 frustration clause 2 ̆ 2 exists, or will soon come into being, and that it would resemble a reverse Force Majeure clause and be found in relatively high-value contracts. These predictions are then confirmed with several examples of frustration clauses observed in the real world: the Morals clause, the Walkaway clause, and, most notably, the MAC clause. Then I apply the reverse analysis to the MAC clause and show it to be a <b>standard</b> <b>clause</b> analog of the frustration doctrine that alters the default rule by (a) permitting excuse {{on the basis of a}} significant (but less than total) loss in contractual value, (b) excusing the acquirer based on frustration of a 2 ̆ 2 secondary 2 ̆ 2 (as opposed to its 2 ̆ 2 primary 2 ̆ 2) purpose, and (c) shifting major exogenous risks (such as an economic recession or a natural disaster) from the target to the acquirer. I conclude with a case study to demonstrate the difference between the MAC clause and the default frustration doctrine: Bank of America 2 ̆ 7 s recent 50 billion acquisition of Merrill Lynch in late 2008. During the brief three-month period between signing and closing, Merrill lost an astounding 15 billion, but the conventional wisdom [...] shared by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, among others [...] is that Merrill 2 ̆ 7 s loss clearly failed to trigger the MAC clause. I disagree. While the default frustration doctrine would not have offered any relief, Bank of America may well have had viable grounds to invoke the MAC clause, properly understood, and walk away from the Merrill deal...|$|R
