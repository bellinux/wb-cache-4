5000|$|<b>Per</b> <b>stirpes</b> ( [...] ; [...] "by branch") is a {{legal term}} from Latin.

50|$|Where an heir {{who is a}} {{descendant}} of the testator, whether {{as a member of}} a class or otherwise, is disqualified from inheriting on any one of the grounds treated above, the benefit that he would have received devolves to his descendants <b>per</b> <b>stirpes.</b> This statutory rule is subject to there being no contrary intention in the will.|$|R
50|$|The 1580 Ordinance {{adopted the}} schependomsrecht {{distribution}} <b>per</b> <b>stirpes,</b> restricting {{it in the}} case of collaterals to the fourth degree inclusive.

50|$|Example 2A: In {{the first}} example, {{children}} C and D survive, so the estate is divided at their generation. There were three children, so each surviving child receives one-third.

50|$|Example 1B: If {{grandchild}} B1 had predeceased A, leaving {{two children}} B1a and B1b, and grandchild B2 had also died leaving three children B2a, B2b and B2c, then distribution <b>per</b> <b>stirpes</b> would give one-third each to C and D, one-twelfth each to B1a and B1b, who {{would constitute a}} branch, and one-eighteenth each to B2a, B2b and B2c. Thus, the B, C, and D branches receive equal shares of the whole estate, the B1 and B2 branches receive equal shares of the B branch's share, B1a and B1b receive equal shares of the B1 branch's share, and B2a, B2b and B2c receive equal shares of the B2 branch's share.|$|R
5000|$|In {{many states}} of the United States, such as New York, a statute has {{modified}} this definition and utilizes a [...] "Modern Per Stirpes" [...] approach (or Per Capita with Right of Representation).

Dealing with stress in singular events as the transfer of a business, is hardly been subject of research (Uy et al. 2012). Improving coping strategies in business transfers for the incumbent could be of importance as statistics indicate the continued aging of owners in the European Union. Expanding the possibilities of incumbents to sell their business and move on to their next phase in their life would help to offset such negative effects to each national economy. The number of failed business transfers of viable SMEs now threatens innovative driven European economies (European Commission 2003, Van Teeffelen 2010, Stone et al. 2004).

(ii) How does time since the last clear-cut change seed bank composition during post-clear-cut succession? Methods: One data set was compiled <b>per</b> <b>succession</b> type using the following selection criteria: (i) the data set included a successional series, (ii) plots were located in mesotrophic forest plant communities and (iii) vegetation data were available. The post-agricultural succession data set comprised 76 recent forest plots (eight studies); the post-clear-cut succession data set comprised 218 ancient forest plots (three studies). Each data set was analysed separately using either linear mixed models or generalized linear models, controlling for both environmental heterogeneity and variation between study locations. Results: In the post-agricultural succession data set, {{land use and}} time significantly affected nearly all the studied seed bank characteristics. Seed banks on former arable land recovered poorly even after 150 year of restored forest cover, whereas moderate land use intensities (grasslands, heathlands) yielded more rapid seed bank recovery. Time was a significant determinant of all but two soil seed bank characteristics during post-clear-cut succession. Seed banks in managed ancient forest differed strongly in their characteristics compared to primary forest seed banks. Conclusions: Forest seed banks bear the marks of former land use and/or forest management and {{continue to do so}} for at least 150 years. Nevertheless, time since the last major disturbance, being either former land use or clear-cutting, remains a significant determinant of the seed bank...|$|R
5000|$|The temple {{belonged to}} the Thachudaya Kaimals of TravancoreThe Royal family of Travancore {{appointed}} Thachudaya Kaimal long,long ago as their representative to administer the temple. The authority of administration was conferred ceremonially (avarodham). Kaimal {{was expected to be}} a bachelor, being in service of the Lord, who himself is depicted as the puranic ascetic ruler awaiting the return of Lord Rama. The Lord was ruling the nation as a representative of Sree Ramachandra, as a hermit. The Lord is famous for his nobility and humility in that he worshipped the sandals of Sri Ramachandra he kept on the throne. The spiritual heads of the temple belong to six namboodiri illoms. True, Thachudaya Kaimal wielded immense powers. But he was not above Travancore King. He was, at best, a Governor as we now have (entitled to continue during the pleasure of the Governor) though history does not mention any occasion of displeasure of His Majesty. His office was incapable of <b>succession</b> as <b>per</b> personal law. [...] and HH The Thachudaya Kaimal is considered the chief and temporal ruler of the Koodalmanikyam Temple and its Estates. The thanthris had the last say in spiritual matters. The line goes back into antiquity and is mentioned in the Skanda Purana. The Thachudaya Kaimals enjoy considerable immunities by law even in modern times such as being preceded by a personal escort of attendants with lamp and sword. The Ruling Chief has an escort of the Travancore Nayar Brigade. He has no acknowledged superiors and does not rise even {{in the presence of the}} King of Cochin, who is the head of the Kshatriyas of Kerala. The Maharaja of Travancore stands with his head bowed and the Raja of Cochin symbolically carries the palanquin of the Thachudaya Kaimal. The residence of the Kaimal is the Kottilakkal Palace in Irinjalakuda. The Arms of the Kaimal and that of the temple bear the insignia of a coiled conch-shell with the words 'Manikkam Keralar'. With the 26th amendment of the Indian constitution in 1971, the Princely order in India was abolished and the Thachudaya Kaimals lost their ownership of the temple and its estates. It is now managed by a Trust managed by the District Collector although a vestige of former power lies in his being the chief trustee of the temple. [...] However, no current members of the family in Trivandrum have staked claim to the position. The Devaswom then allotted land to accommodate institutions such as the Christ College, and for public use to facilitate development activities in the region. Much land that belonged to Koodalmanikyam was subjected to encroachment.|$|R
40|$|Many kind of {{researches}} {{have been}} made {{for the cause of}} the formation of liver cirrhosis and recently the relation between the spleen and the cause {{has been the subject of}} discussion. But there are many points that are not come to light yet. The author has made an investigation about the significance of the reticulo-endothelial system and spleen-hormone relating the rise of this disease. By looking ober the experimental methods of study that {{have been made}}, he can divide them in to four classes:- 1. To put in various kinds of medicines. 2. To give special or one and the same kind of food for a long time. 3. The bile duct and ligature of the veins that enter and leave. 4. To give bacteria and their products. As inflammatory poisons, among other things, alcohol, chloroform, phosphorus, arsenic, tar, adrenalinemia, decoction of tobacco-leaves, antimony arsenite, and etc. have been used for a long time. But lately it is reported that carbon tetrachloride was used to give rise to liver cirrhosis. Mr. Midorikawa injected 0. 05 cc. carbon tetrachloride as the quantity for a day into rabbits respectively for dozens of times over and made the image of liver cirrhosis in the liver. Mr. Paul Ramson, and Mr. Kubo have reported that they got the same result. As for the author, he injected 0. 6 cc. oleum olivarum which contains 20 % of carbon tetrachloride per kilogram weight of body respectively into the male rabbits weighing some 1. 5 kg. each and accomplished the study. Experiment I. To research for the significance of the general reticulo-endothelial system in relation to the cause of this disease, first he made an experiment of reticulo-endothelial blocking that is to say, he made 1 % collargol solution by Mr. Amano's method; and injected 0 65 cc. of it into each rabbit through their ears' veins per kilogram weight of body. After that he detected the ebb and flow of reticulo-endothelial function for same days by using trypanblue solution by Mr. Adler-Reimann's method. This experiment made it sure that the quantity of collargol which was used in it reduced the function to the weakest state next day and it recovered 3 as usual after 14 days. Thus given two groups of stout rabbit were used in this experiment. The first group were injected with collargol solution and next day with carbon-tetrachloride. Into the second group he injected carbon-tetrachloride first and collargol solution next day. After four days killed them all, he extirpated their livers, fitted them with 10 % formalin solution, made cutting preparation gave various dyeing to them and detected the change of the disease. The result. of the experiment shows apparently addifference between the results of the two groups; that is, both of them showed degenerative metamorphosis of liver but the change of the first is far greater than that of the second. Next, the same experiment done ober every fifteenth day for a long period showed still the same result as that above mentioned. This proves that the perpection or the imperpection of the reticulo-endothelial function has an important significance relating the change of liver disease. Experiment II. The author made the following experiment to know the significance of spleen relating the cause of the formation of the experimental liver cirrhosis. Given four groups of rabbits were used in this experiment. The first group are stout ones as a standard; the second group whose spleens were extirpated six days ago; the third group who were once extirpated their spleens cleanly and soon made auto-transplantation in their bellies six days ago; the fourth group whose spleen were extirpated 45 days ago. He injected 0. 6 cc. oleum olivarum which contains 20 % carbontetrachloride into the above mentioned four groups of rabbits respectively per kilogram weight of body and after four days killed all of them and compared their liver cirrhosis in the same way. The period of 45 days after the extirpation of spleen is the time when abolition in the function of spleen is to be compensated. By the result of the above experiment, clear distinction can be found out between the first group and the second group; namely, the change of the liver disease of rabbits after extirpation of spleens is in far higher degree than that of stout ones. But those of the third group and the fourth group are very slight and rather come near to that of the first group. This proves that the existence of spleen has an important significance in relation to the rise of this disease. Experiment III. Lately the study of internal secretion spring into existence and it was proved that spleen is one of the internal organs that do the internal secretion and that spleenextract contains spleen-hormone which is said chiefly to acts on reticulo-endothelial system. In order to examine the effect which spleen-extract works on the rising of this disease, he made the following experiment. First to detect how spleen extract works on stout rabbit, he injected 1. 0 cc. of 25 times diluted spleen-extract (Prepare:- see the authors thesis, "The biochemistric-study of spleen-extract") into the ears' veins of the first group for three days in <b>succession</b> <b>per</b> kilogram weight of body, and for the second group, as a standard, he injected 0. 85 % salt solution into them in the same way and the next day injected 0. 6 cc. oleum olivarum which contains 20 % carbon-tetrachloride into the both groups per kilogram weight of body and killed them after four days and compared the change of the liver disease in the same way. Though the result of this experiment shows little difference between the first group and the second group, he found that the change of the former is comperatively less than that of the latter. Next he repeated the same experiment on the rabbits who were extirpated spleen six days ago and got the result of great difference between the first group and the second group; that is to say, the change of the disease in the case of injecting spleen-extract into the spleen extirpated rabbits was far slighter than that in the other case and was nearly in the same degree as that of ordinary rabbit. But, as a standard, in the case of injecting them with only 0. 855 % salt solution first and then carbon tetrachloride, the change of the liver disease was in exceedingly high degree. Again he made an experiment in the same way on the rabbits that were extirpated their spleen (6 days) ago and blocked completely the rest of reticulo-endothelial cell by injecting their ears' veins with large quantity of 0. 8 cc. collargol solution per kilogram weight of body for three days in succession. And the result of it made a clear distinction between those of the first group and the second group; namely, the change of the disease of the rabbits that were injected with spleen-extract was far slighter than that of those who were injected, simply as a standard, with 0. 85 % salt solution. The author repeated the same experiment on the rabbits that were extirpated spleens six days ago, by using chloroform (to give through mouth 0. 5 cc. of it per kilogram weight of body) and "Nekoirazu" (to give through mouth 0. 05 gram of it per kilogram weight of body). By this it is sure that the changes of the disease by injecting with spleen-extract are all slighter than those of the standard examples. And these experiments make it clear that spleen-hormone has an important relation to the cause of the formation of the experimental liver cirrhosis. From the experiments above mentioned the author has obtained the following conclusions:-I) The general reticulo-endothelial system relating the cause of the formation of the experimental system liver Cirrhosis has a fixed relation. That is, when the function of the general reticulo-endothelial system is imperfect or the spleen is abolished, the invasive poison attacks the livercells sooner and heavier. II) The change of the disease above mentioned is exceedingly lighten by the transplantation of spleen piese and the injection of spleen-extract. That is, the special substance of spleen (HORMONE-) has an action to be able to reduse the change of the liver by poison through the general reticulo-endothelial system, especially Kupper's star-cell...|$|R
