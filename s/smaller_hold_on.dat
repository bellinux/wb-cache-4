50|$|Borthwood, a <b>small</b> <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> {{the borders}} of Newchurch and Brading, was {{originally}} a wooded tract of far greater extent, and termed a forest. It appears among the lands of William son of Azor in Domesday, being held with Branston and Lessland. Borthwood seems frequently to have been granted with the lordship of the Island, and belonged to Piers Gaveston in 1309, and to the Earl of Chester in 1316. In 1415 it was granted with the lordship to Philippa, Duchess of York, and in 1507 paid a fee-farm rent of 66s. 8d. to the Crown. Borthwood afterwards seems to have become annexed to the manor of Thorley, for in 1587-8 'the farm of the manor of Brodewood parcel of the manor of Thorley with Brodewood' was leased for twenty-one years to Thomas Keys. (fn. 162) In 1780 Robert Worsley paid the Crown a rent for tithes in Borthwood. Borthwood in 1820 was owned by Sir W. G. Stirling, who acquired it probably by his marriage with Susannah daughter of George T. Goodenough of Borthwood, and in 1912 it was held by Mr. W. G. Stirling.|$|R

50|$|Old Road by M.J.Molloy; is set {{in rural}} Galway {{in the spring and}} summer of 1939. The spectre of the Second World War looms large over a group of young people who are desperate to escape to a better life in England. Land ownership, poverty, lack of {{opportunity}} and old-fashioned marriage customs threaten to drive the younger generation away from their native Connaught. The action takes place in the household of the choleric, cantankerous and tyrannical old farmer Lordeen; who, desperate for a wife, engages the services of the mercenary matchmaker William Duffy. In the meanwhile, love blossom between the Lord’s servants, the cool and happy-go-lucky Myles Cosgrave and the damsel-in-distress Bridgeen McDonagh who do their best to deny their passion for each other. Bodhagh Merrigan, a conniving land-grabber manipulates the Lordeen’s situation to lay hold of his 70 acre farm, whilst Merrigan’s own son Paak must go to England, denied the chance of a <b>small</b> <b>holding</b> and marriage to his first love Mary. Lordeen’s other labourer, the cobbler and self-styled intellectual Luke Sweeney, is the target for the affections of the caustic, ‘black’ widow, Mrs Callaghan. Merrigan and Mrs Callaghan collude to ensure that Lordeen finds out that Myles has been trading agricultural goods to make up the shortfall in his pay. Lordeen, in a fit of Rage calls for the Sergeant who decides not to press charges, torn between his duty to the law and what he feels to be his own Christian moral code. Myles proposes to Brigid who readily accepts and in hope of staying in Ireland asks Merrigan to allow them to rent <b>small</b> <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> his land. Believing that this is part of a scheme to dupe the Sergeant, Merrigan agrees. WHen the Sergeant leaves, Merrigan denies Myles the opportunity to rent and tells him to let Brigid go to England by herself. Merrigan pursues the Patrick Walsh to sell him his farm, but the Lordeen clutching to the hope of finding a wife refuses to sell and is set to drink himself into oblivion. The others arrive and dissuade Brigid from marrying Myles and they leave set for an uncertain future in England.|$|R

40|$|CPR (Checkpoint Processing and Recovery) is a {{physical}} register management scheme that supports a larger instruction window and higher average IPC than conventional ROB-style register management. It does so by restricting mis-speculation recovery to checkpoints created at rename, and leveraging this restriction to aggressively reclaim registers that don't appear in checkpoints. The cost of CPR is checkpoint overhead, which is incurred when a mis-speculation occurs on an instruction for which a checkpoint was not created a priori. Here, CPR must recover to the immediately older checkpoint, squashing instructions older than the mis-speculation itself. In contrast, a ROB processor performs minimal recovery and only squashes instructions younger than the mis-speculation. CPROB is a hybrid register management scheme that preserves CPR's aggressive reclamation while opportunistically minimizing checkpoint overhead. CPROB extends CPR to track and hold the registers needed to perform minimal recovery to un-executed branches within each checkpoint. Recovery registers are held on a best-effort basis only. A checkpoint's recovery registers can be freed spontaneously when all branches in the checkpoint execute. They can also be aggressively victimized if dispatch needs registers to proceed. CPROB naturally adapts the register reclamation policy to dynamic branch behavior. When branch mis-predictions are infrequent and registers are needed to support a large window, CPROB victimizes registers and behaves like CPR. When mis-predictions are frequent and the window is <b>small,</b> CPROB <b>holds</b> <b>on</b> to registers and behaves like ROB. As a result, it out-performs both CPR and ROB for a given program. This performance improvement, combined with reduced checkpoint overhead, makes CPROB more energy-efficient than either ROB or CPR...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for the {{objective}} comparison of two nested models based on non-local priors. More specifically, {{starting with a}} default prior under {{each of the two}} models, we construct a moment prior under the larger model, and then use the fractional Bayes factor for a comparison. Non-local priors have been recently introduced to obtain a better separation between nested models, thus accelerating the learning behaviour, relative to currently used local priors, when the <b>smaller</b> model <b>holds.</b> Although the argument showing the superior performance of non-local priors is asymptotic, the improvement they produce is already apparent for small to moderate samples sizes, which makes them a useful and practical tool. As a by-product, it turns out that routinely used objective methods, such as ordinary fractional Bayes factors, are alarmingly slow in learning that the <b>smaller</b> model <b>holds.</b> <b>On</b> the downside, when the larger model holds, non-local priors exhibit a weaker discriminatory power against sampling distributions close to the smaller model. However, this drawback becomes rapidly negligible as the sample size grows, because the learning rate of the Bayes factor under the larger model is exponentially fast, whether one uses local or non-local priors. We apply our methodology to directed acyclic graph models having a Gaussian distribution. Because of the recursive nature of the joint density, and the assumption of global parameter independence embodied in our prior, calculations need only be performed for individual vertices admitting a distinct parent structure under the two graphs; additionally we obtain closed-form expressions as in the ordinary conjugate case. We provide illustrations of our method for a simple three-variable case, as well as for a more elaborate seven-variable situation. Although we concentrate on pairwise comparisons of nested models, our procedure can be implemented to carry-out a search over the space of all models.
