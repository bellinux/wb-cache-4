500|$|Rapunzel was {{the first}} blonde-haired Disney {{animated}} heroine since Aurora in Sleeping Beauty (1959). Animating Rapunzel's hair using computer-generated imagery has been regarded as the most challenging aspect in the development process of Tangled. [...] According to the Los Angeles Times, supervising animator Glen Keane has become well known for animating some of Walt Disney Animation Studios' [...] "greatest hair hits" [...] since 1989, including Ariel from The Little Mermaid, the Beast from Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Pocahontas from Pocahontas (1995). Both Keane and Howard have expressed similar opinions on Rapunzel's hair, with Keane describing it as [...] "this constant reminder that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>this</b> gift", and Howard describing it as its own character. As directors, Howard and Greno provided the animators with much live-action material and reference to use as inspiration for the appearance of Rapunzel's hair, such as attaching long strands of string to a baseball cap that they would take turns wearing {{in the studio and}} moving around it. Additionally, they recruited women who had not cut their hair in several years to serve as live models.|$|E
500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in the third season where Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Emerson comments [...] "Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science". Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , but I still think it was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>this</b> amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her". During season four the producers deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether Ben {{was a part of the}} Oceanic 6 (six survivors of the plane crash that make it off the Island) after he appeared in one of Sayid's flashforwards.|$|E

2500|$|The {{theme song}} [...] "Nagpapanggap" [...] (Pretending/Deceiving) {{from the film}} Kerida (The Mistress) depicts a person's {{awareness}} that her lover is only pretending to love her, and yet <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>this</b> pragmatic acceptance and is even thankful that she was loved, no matter how false that love may be.|$|E
2500|$|Oppewall {{said of her}} career, [...] "What I do for {{a living}} is not {{dissimilar}} from what an actor does. I have a different set of tools, but it's the same process. The reason that it's fun to design sets is that it allows you to try on personalities that you'd never otherwise experience." [...] Gary Ross, director of Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, said of Oppewall, [...] "Jeannine doesn't suffer fools gladly, and she hasn't suffered me gladly when I've been a fool. She's fastidious, restrained and refined, and yet <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>this</b> impulsive side where she just takes off and chases butterflies." [...] Gary Hoblit, who directed the 1996 Oppewall-designed film Primal Fear, said he particularly appreciated her flexibility and versatility: [...] "While she may prefer a world in which less is more, she can still create an opulent and gooey world that is appropriate for someone unlike her." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2014, it was {{announced}} that Rihanna had left Def Jam Recordings to sign fully with her manager Jay Z's company Roc Nation, and later revealed she had acquired the masters to all her recordings and would be releasing her eighth studio album jointly through her own record label Westbury Road and Roc Nation. On February 8, 2015, during his Grammy Awards red carpet interview, American rapper Kanye West announced, that he will be the executive producer of Anti. West further compared Rihanna's vocals on the song to that of Scottish singer Annie Lennox: [...] "I feel like <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>this</b> type of energy in her vocals. And she even brought it to another level of like soul and heart and artistry". However, in January 2016, in a Twitter reply message to a fan, Rihanna wrote that West is no longer executive producer of the album and both of them are working on different projects. Instead, Rihanna served as the executive producer of Anti and worked with several producers.|$|E

2500|$|On February 8, {{during his}} Grammy Awards red carpet interview, West {{explained}} how the collaboration came to fruition: [...] "I'm {{executive producer of}} Rihanna's album, and I said I'd done a few songs with Paul McCartney and she couldn't get past this record. She had to have it on her album... So now we at the Grammys doing it". West further compared Rihanna's vocals on the song to that of Scottish singer Annie Lennox: [...] "I feel like <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>this</b> type of energy in her vocals. And she even brought it to another level of like soul and heart and artistry". In an interview with V magazine, Rihanna revealed, [...] "The thing that made me {{fall in love with}} [...] is the juxtaposition of the music and the lyrics. When you read the lyrics it's a completely different song than what you are hearing. The music is easygoing, but the lyrical content is very loud and in your face." [...] Although it is a first collaboration by the trio, they have collaborated separately. West and McCartney collaborated on the 2014 single [...] "Only One", a track dedicated to West's daughter North. Rihanna and West previously collaborated on Jay-Z's 2009 single [...] "Run This Town" [...] — which became a commercial success and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — and West's 2011 single [...] "All of the Lights", a track featuring backup vocals by John Legend, Fergie, and Elton John among others.|$|E

Thou wilt find her a most gentle, unobtrusive, ministering girl, Isabel. She will never name the not-to-be-named things to thee; nor hint of them; because she knows them not. Still, without knowing the secret, she yet hath the vague, unspecializing {{sensation}} of the secret--the mystical presentiment, somehow, of the secret. And her divineness hath drowned all womanly curiosity in her; so that she desires not, in any way, to verify the presentiment; content with the vague presentiment only; for in that, she thinks, the heavenly summons to come to us, lies;--even there, in that, Isabel.

And I'd carry Lord Fawn off to the Antipodes, too;--and I shouldn't care if you left him there. I know that this man is innocent, and I'd do anything to save him.
