5|$|Lieber threw three pitches: a fastball, a <b>slider,</b> and a changeup. The <b>slider</b> was {{the pitch}} Lieber {{often used to}} get outs and was most {{successful}} against right-handed batters. The changeup darted away from batters. Lieber was not a hard thrower (his fastball was in the low 90mph range); he relied on controlling his pitches to have success.|$|E
5|$|Mota {{has three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a fastball, a <b>slider,</b> and a circle changeup. The <b>slider</b> is the pitch he usually uses to get outs. Wildness {{has been a problem}} for him, though, and his fastball is easy to hit when thrown over the plate. In the past, he has thrown a splitter and a curveball.|$|E
5|$|Nathan {{throws a}} mix of four pitches. His main pitch, a four-seam fastball was once thrown in the mid-to-upper 90s, but now settles between 91 and 94mph. His main {{breaking}} ball is a hard <b>slider</b> in the upper 80s, occasionally even touching 90. He uses the <b>slider</b> less frequently against left-handed hitters, preferring to use a curveball in the low 80s. He also uses a two-seam fastball against lefties. His <b>slider</b> is his best swing-and-miss pitch, with a whiff rate of 42% since 2007.|$|E
50|$|Mating {{can occur}} in spring, summer, and autumn. Yellow-bellied <b>sliders</b> are capable of interbreeding with other T. scripta subspecies, such as red-eared <b>sliders,</b> which are {{commonly}} sold as pets. The release of non-native red-eared <b>sliders</b> into local environments caused the state of Florida to ban the sale of red-eared <b>sliders</b> {{in order to protect}} the native population of yellow-bellied <b>sliders.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Springfield <b>Sliders</b> {{ran away}} with the CICL's final Championship Title. The <b>Sliders</b> won the First Half, Regular Season and Playoff Championship. The 2008 season was the inaugural season for the <b>Sliders</b> and the final season of the CICL.|$|R

5|$|Nova {{worked in}} 2011 {{to develop his}} <b>slider,</b> {{changing}} his grip {{at the suggestion of}} Yankees executive Billy Connors. The work paid off, as his <b>slider</b> garnered a whiff rate of 43% in 2011. Nova's changeup is not his main weapon and is not used against right-handed hitters.|$|E
5|$|Feldman is a three-quarters pitcher with a sinker, a low-to-mid-90s fastball, a hard {{dropping}} <b>slider,</b> a curve, a changeup, and a 90mph cut fastball.|$|E
5|$|His curveball, like Madison Bumgarner, has two speeds with {{different}} types of movement, though he throws his slow curveball much more frequently than does Bumgarner, and will sometimes throw a curve that is more in the middle range combining the types of movement. His two-seamer is his most-used pitch against right-handed hitters and is used more frequently than against lefties, as is his <b>slider.</b> His changeup is only thrown to left-handed hitters. Greinke's curveball is typically used early in the count, while his <b>slider</b> is his most common 2-strike pitch.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{characters}} recurred on <b>Sliders,</b> the science fiction show. The show involved a concept of doubles—alternate versions of a person on alternate Earths. Thus, a number of recurring characters on <b>Sliders</b> were doubles of each other. There were some recurring characters, however, who were other <b>sliders.</b>|$|R

50|$|Various {{kinds of}} <b>sliders,</b> called frame <b>sliders,</b> frame protectors, fairing protectors, or crash bobbins, are {{attached}} to motorcycles {{with the intention of}} minimizing damage to the bike's fairings, frame, engine, and other parts, {{in the event of a}} crash, or an accidental tip over. They are made of plastics, such as Delrin, acetal, or nylon, or sometimes aluminum. Frame <b>sliders</b> are usually located and installed on the engine bolts on both sides of the fairings. Front or rear axle <b>sliders,</b> also called fork <b>sliders</b> and swing-arm spool <b>sliders</b> provide some potential damage reduction for the suspension components, wheels, and other parts by making contact with the ground before the rest of the bike. Hard-mounted foot pegs, which do not fold upward can also serve as a buffer between the ground and the bike's frame and components.|$|R
5|$|Despite Nova's success, he was demoted to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre due to {{the return}} of Bartolo Colón and Phil Hughes from the {{disabled}} list, as Nova had minor league options remaining. Nova used the time with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre {{to work on his}} <b>slider.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hennessey threw five pitches: a fastball, a <b>slider,</b> a changeup, a curveball, and a cutter. The fastball was Hennessey's main pitch; {{he threw}} it over 60% {{of the time}} in the majors. He did not throw it very hard, {{averaging}} speeds under 90mph in 2007 and 2008. His <b>slider</b> was his secondary pitch, and his changeup was his third most-used pitch. Hennessey rarely used the cutter except for in 2006, when he threw it 10.1% of the time. Henessey often was plagued by a big inning, displaying a tendency to allow several runs in an inning during his starts.|$|E
5|$|In the West, human-introduced bass, bullfrogs, and {{especially}} snapping turtles, {{have increased the}} predation of hatchlings. Outside the Southeast, where sliders are native, released pet red-eared <b>slider</b> turtles increasingly compete with painted turtles. In cities, increased urban predators (raccoons, canines, and felines) may impact painted turtles by eating their eggs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the pantograph-catenary {{system of}} {{electric}} railroads, there is friction heat between high-speed moving pantograph <b>sliders</b> and the contact wires, {{leading to a}} temperature increase on the contact surface. On the contact surface under the current collecting conditions, there are also contact resistance heat and arc heat produced by the current effect, leading to further temperature increase of the pantograph <b>sliders.</b> This paper applies finite element method to analyze the steady heat transfer and transient heat transfer of the pantograph <b>sliders</b> of high-speed train and studies the transient heat transfer of <b>sliders</b> and contact wires in actual movement. The computing results determined the temperature fluctuation range and temperature distribution when <b>sliders</b> and contact wires are in normal working condition...|$|R
5000|$|Jack Critchfield Park is {{a stadium}} in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania. It is {{primarily}} used for baseball and hosts the Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania college baseball team. The ballpark {{is also home}} of the Prospect League's Slippery Rock <b>Sliders.</b> It was also {{the home of the}} Slippery Rock <b>Sliders</b> of the Frontier League in 2007. The Frontier <b>Sliders</b> played a partial home schedule in 2007, then left Slippery Rock to become a full-time road team in 2008. The Slippery Rock <b>Sliders</b> played at the Park from 2009 until 2012, when they became the Champion City Kings of Springfield, Ohio.|$|R
5|$|Ramón A. Ramírez (born September 16, 1982) is a Venezuelan {{pitcher who}} is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cincinnati Reds. He throws three pitches: a fastball, a <b>slider,</b> and a changeup.|$|E
5|$|Wilson was a power pitcher. He has a {{repertoire}} of four pitches. He throws a straight four-seam fastball around 92-95mph; {{this is one of}} his main pitches. He also has a <b>slider,</b> a cut fastball, and a two-seam fastball. His <b>slider</b> traveled around 89mph. His cut fastball has allowed him to use fewer four-seam fastballs. In 2011, he started throwing the two-seam fastball as well. The two-seamer starts away on a right-handed hitter (or in to a left-handed hitter) and has dramatic inward (or outward) movement over the plate. He has also experimented with curveballs, screwballs, and knuckleballs.|$|E
5|$|Hughes's pitch {{repertoire}} has varied {{over the}} years, although his main pitch has consistently been a four-seam fastball at 92–95mph, {{and he has}} also relied on a spike curveball {{in the range of}} 73–77mph. He has also developed a mid-80s Vulcan changeup against left-handed hitters, and in mid-2012 he developed a low-80s <b>slider</b> to right-handers.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, the Slippery Rock <b>Sliders</b> of the Frontier League {{played their}} first season in Slippery Rock at Jack Critchfield. They left the borough {{after their first}} season, and are now the Midwest <b>Sliders</b> of Ypsilanti.

50|$|The Springfield <b>Sliders</b> are a collegiate summer league {{baseball}} {{team in the}} United States Prospect League. They play at Robin Roberts Field at Lanphier Park and are based {{in the city of}} Springfield, Illinois. The <b>Sliders</b> formed in November 2007 and were an expansion franchise for the 2008 season. The <b>Sliders</b> and other collegiate summer leagues and teams exist to give top college players professional-like experience without affecting NCAA eligibility.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Sliders</b> {{were formed}} for the 2007 season to ensure an even number of teams with the Frontier League's {{addition}} of the Southern Illinois Miners. The <b>Sliders</b> played a mere 32 home games at Jack Critchfield Park in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, with the remaining 64 played on the road. For the 2008 season, the <b>Sliders</b> became a traveling team, playing all of their games on the road under the geographical moniker, Midwest.|$|R
5|$|Painted turtle pet-keeping {{requirements}} {{are similar to}} those of the red-eared <b>slider.</b> Keepers are urged to provide them with adequate space and a basking site, and water that is regularly filtered and changed. According to Petco, the animals are described as being somewhat unsuitable for children as they do not enjoy being held. Hobbyists have kept turtles alive for decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound on}} a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied through the {{manipulation}} of drawbars. A drawbar is a metal <b>slider</b> that controls the volume of a particular sound component, {{in a similar way}} to a fader on an audio mixing board. As a drawbar is incrementally pulled out, it increases the volume of its sound. When pushed all the way in, the volume is decreased to zero.|$|E
5|$|De Fratus has a two-pitch {{repertoire}} {{that consists}} of a fastball and a <b>slider,</b> the latter of which is his out pitch. He embraces a propensity to work quickly on the mound, and use a lower arm slot. Off the field, De Fratus {{is a member of}} the Roman Catholic church, and uses baseball to strengthen his faith. He sees evangelism as a duty of Christians, and would like to go to seminary when he finishes his baseball career.|$|E
5000|$|Frame <b>sliders</b> [...] - [...] These large knobs are {{attached}} to a motorcycle's frame to protect the fairing from damage should the rider lay down the bike. Also used by many non-stunters. Frame <b>sliders</b> {{should not be considered}} a substitute for a cage when learning how to stunt. Although Frame <b>sliders</b> will reduce the damage to the plastics and certain parts of the bike they are not enough to keep from cracking motor cases and or cracking the frame itself.|$|R
50|$|The BMW Telever fork {{has only}} a single triple tree, which allows its fork <b>sliders</b> to be longer than those on {{telescopic}} forks. This in turn allows for greater overlap of the <b>sliders</b> over the stanchion tubes, which improves stiffness and helps to reduce flex.|$|R

5|$|On April 21, 2015, Davis {{pitched a}} perfect eighth inning in {{the losing side}} of a blowout against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, {{retiring}} all 3 batters he faced, all on ground balls, using only 9 pitches. Davis in high school was 23–0 with a 1.85 ERA and was the Arizona High School Pitcher of the Year, and in college he had a 2.25 ERA as a pitcher. Against the Angels he threw his fastball as high as 88 miles per hour, threw a <b>slider</b> in the high 70s, and threw a cutter. It {{was the first time}} the A’s had a position player pitch since Frank Menechino in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Angels {{released}} Ramírez in March 2004, {{without being}} promoted beyond the Class A level. Disappointed, Ramírez considered retiring from baseball. With {{the advice of}} his father, Ramírez decided that as Major League Baseball pitchers often relied on a <b>slider</b> or curveball as a complimentary pitch to their fastball, he would develop a different pitch. Ramírez spent his time that year learning a changeup on baseball fields in Miami, Florida, and did not pitch professionally during the 2004 season. Working with Maximo Soto, a fellow minor league pitcher released by the Angels, Ramírez developed his changeup to provide him with a new weapon in his pitching arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Umbricht threw four pitches, a fastball, curveball, <b>slider</b> and the changeup. He {{was used}} {{primarily}} as a setup pitcher during his brief tenure with the Colts. According to former teammate and roommate Ken Johnson, Umbricht {{was used by the}} Colts mainly to control damage caused by starting pitchers after they were removed from games. In his five-year Major League Baseball career, Umbricht compiled a 9–5 win–loss record, with 133 strikeouts, three saves and a 3.06 earned run average in 88 games.|$|E
40|$|This senior project {{describes}} the design, fabrication, {{and evaluation of}} off-road rock <b>sliders</b> {{which can be used}} with Toyota Tacoma trucks of model year 2005 - 2012. Rock <b>sliders</b> are a form of trail armor and are a common aftermarket addition to trucks that are often used in off-road conditions. Rock <b>sliders,</b> in their simplest form, consist of a steel beam (either tubular or rectangular) that runs underneath the doors of the vehicle providing protection to the undercarriage, rocker panels, and doors as well as reducing the likelihood of becoming stuck or “high-centered” {{on the underside of the}} vehicle. The <b>sliders</b> will be designed to bolt on to the frame of a 2012 model Tacoma. The cost effectiveness and design will be assessed...|$|R
5000|$|When the <b>sliders</b> {{first met}} Maggie in the episode [...] "The Exodus", {{she was a}} captain in the United States Marines {{under the command of}} Colonel Angus Rickman. She was married to Dr. Stephen Jensen, who was in a {{wheelchair}} due to an accident a year prior. She was part of a plot to assassinate Dr. Jaribeck, a scientist who discovered that a pulsar would soon irradiate the Earth, killing all life. Since the <b>sliders</b> were with him when he died, Maggie questioned them about anything he might have said. The <b>sliders</b> managed to escape from Maggie and locked her in the trunk of a car, but Maggie arrested the <b>sliders</b> when she met them again at Dr. Jaribeck's office at California Institute of Technology.|$|R
5000|$|The {{franchise}} {{was founded}} {{as the original}} Slippery Rock <b>Sliders</b> in 2007. (The name [...] "Slippery Rock Sliders" [...] was later used by a summer collegiate baseball team of the Prospect League.) The team was renamed Midwest <b>Sliders</b> in 2008 and played as a traveling team for that season. It was renamed again to Midwest <b>Sliders</b> of Ypsilanti in 2009 and relocated to Ypsilanti, Michigan. The team was renamed again to Oakland County Cruisers in 2010.
