5|$|The MP 38 {{receiver}} {{was made}} of machined steel, {{but this was a}} time-consuming and expensive process. To <b>save</b> <b>time</b> and materials, and thus increase production, construction of the MP 40 receiver was simplified by using stamped steel and electro-spot welding as much as possible.|$|E
5|$|Early {{suggestions}} were to show cutaways {{of just a}} {{small portion}} of the audience, but the full effect was achieved by only showing the back of the audience. To <b>save</b> <b>time,</b> most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, Ratatouille. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} optical effects workload, Ferren {{rejected}} bluescreen compositing, opting instead for rear projection. This cheaper process, he reasoned, would <b>save</b> <b>time,</b> {{and would make}} sense for elements such as the Enterprises bridge viewer, where compositing would lack the softness of a real transmitted image. Designer Lynda Weinman used a Mac II to create the animatics cut into the film during production, which were eventually replaced by the film's finished effects.|$|E

40|$|The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109 - 58; EPAct 2005) {{amended the}} Uniform Time Act of 1966 (Pub. L. No. 89 - 387) to {{increase}} {{the portion of the}} year that is subject to Daylight <b>Saving</b> <b>Time.</b> (15 U. S. C. 260 a note) EPAct 2005 extended the duration of Daylight <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> in the spring by changing its start date from the first Sunday in April to the second Sunday in March, and in the fall by changing its end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November. (15 U. S. C. 260 a note) EPAct 2005 also called for the Department of Energy to evaluate the impact of Extended Daylight <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> on energy consumption in the United States and to submit a report to Congress. (15 U. S. C. 260 a note) This report presents the results of impacts of Extended Daylight <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> on the national energy consumption in the United States. The key findings are: (1) The total electricity savings of Extended Daylight <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> were about 1. 3 Tera Watt-hour (TWh). This corresponds to 0. 5 percent per each day of Extended Daylight <b>Saving</b> <b>Time,</b> or 0. 03 percent of electricity consumption over the year. In reference, the total 2007 electricity consumption in the United States was 3, 900 TWh. (2) In terms of national primary energy consumption, the electricity savings translate to a reduction of 17 Trillion Btu (TBtu) over the spring and fall Extended Daylight <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> periods, or roughly 0. 02 percent of total U. S. energy consumption during 2007 of 101, 000 TBtu. (3) During Extended Daylight <b>Saving</b> <b>Time,</b> electricity savings generally occurred over a three- to five-hour period in the evening with small increases in usage during the early-morning hours. On a daily percentage basis, electricity savings were slightly greater during the March (spring) extension of Extended Daylight <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> than the November (fall) extension. On a regional basis, some southern portions of the United States exhibited slightly smaller impacts of Extended Daylight <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> on energy savings compared to the northern regions, a result possibly due to a small, offsetting increase in household air conditioning usage. (4) Changes in national traffic volume and motor gasoline consumption for passenger vehicles in 2007 were determined to be statistically insignificant and therefore, could not be attributed to Extended Daylight <b>Saving</b> <b>Time...</b>|$|R

5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} <b>save</b> <b>time</b> on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd {{was not involved in}} development. The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from its predecessor to Jumping Flash! 2 in order to <b>save</b> <b>time</b> during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, and updated enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. Jumping Flash! 2 was not designed to be a technology demonstrator, unlike its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Some United States Army Air Forces {{aircraft}} used {{a variation}} of the British camouflage schemes (mostly on aircraft originally built to RAF orders) but most USAAF aircraft did not use multiple shades on the top side of the aircraft. Instead, most were camouflaged in olive drab above and neutral gray below, though some had the edges of flying surfaces painted in medium green. In the later stages of the war camouflage was often dispensed with, both to <b>save</b> <b>time</b> in manufacturing and to reduce weight, leaving aircraft with a natural metal finish.|$|E
5|$|The {{cars had}} an aluminium-alloy {{double-skinned}} construction, and were delivered unpainted to <b>save</b> <b>time.</b> A red adhesive strip {{ran through the}} length of the cars in the middle to match the operator's visual branding. The unpainted cars had a shiny appearance upon delivery, but as dirt and grime accumulated it became a recurring problem for the operator and attracted several public complaints. In response, MRT Corporation built a wash machine at Bishan Depot in an attempt to clean up the cars' exterior proper. After refurbishment, the problem was solved by covering the cars' exterior entirely with giant stickers, creating a livery that is similar to the newer C751B and C151A rolling stocks.|$|E
5|$|The game {{revolves}} around the robotic rabbit Robbit as he searches for lost Muu Muus, which are scattered throughout different levels in the game by Captain Kabuki. Robbit must explore each expansive new world to recapture all the lost Muu Muus. As with its predecessor, the game is presented in a first-person perspective. Much of the interface was transferred from the first Jumping Flash! to the second in order to <b>save</b> <b>time</b> during development. New features include a much longer draw distance, updated enemy AI and a meter displaying whether or not Robbit can triple-jump.|$|E

The Terminals feature a painterly artistic style, which Sequence president Ian Kirby felt appealed to gamers familiar with the style of concept art. In addition to creating the visuals for the Halo 4 terminals, their work appeared {{in one of the}} game's main cinematics. To <b>save</b> <b>time</b> and expense using traditional motion capture methods to animate the 3D characters, The Sequence Group used twin Microsoft Kinect infrared sensors to create a home-made solution.|$|E
5|$|Duke Nukem Forever {{was officially}} {{announced}} on April 28, 1997, {{with the intention}} of releasing the game no later than mid-1998. Barely a year after the release of Duke Nukem 3D, the game's graphics and its game engine, the Build engine, were antiquated. Id Software's new Quake II engine was far superior to Build, so Broussard decided to license it. The price spent for the licensing rights was steep—estimates were as high as $500,000—but Broussard reasoned that it would <b>save</b> <b>time</b> used to write a game engine from scratch. Broussard and Miller were flush with cash from the sales of Duke Nukem 3D and other games, so they decided to fund Duke Nukem Forever themselves, turning marketing and publishing rights over to GT Interactive.|$|E

A large crowd sees them off from outside the Paris Opera House, including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world. After stopping to fill the car with gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed flat as a pancake.

Unlike past requests to cut and/or alter jokes, this was not one imposed by the broadcast standards and practices; this was done on the writers' own accord. The sequence showing Peter's silent film star ancestor being stabbed in a card fight was omitted from television broadcasting to <b>save</b> <b>time.</b> Near {{the end of the}} episode, the Griffins are shown arguing over the quality of The Godfather; this scene is drawn from an actual argument that has taken place in the Family Guy writing room over its quality. MacFarlane prefers The 'Burbs and The Money Pit, both of which were received very poorly. Adolf Hitler talking to his wife about his annoyance at Peter Hitler was also removed from television broadcasting for timing purposes.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Pong, Bushnell pushed his {{employees}} to create new products. In 1974, Atari engineer Harold Lee proposed a home version of Pong that would connect to a television: Home Pong. The system began development under the codename Darlene, named after an attractive female employee at Atari. Alcorn worked with Lee to develop the designs and prototype, and based them on the same digital technology used in their arcade games. The two worked in shifts to <b>save</b> <b>time</b> and money; Lee worked on the design's logic during the day, while Alcorn debugged the designs in the evenings. After the designs were approved, fellow Atari engineer Bob Brown assisted Alcorn and Lee in building a prototype. The prototype consisted of a device attached to a wooden pedestal containing over a hundred wires, which would eventually be replaced with a single chip designed by Alcorn and Lee; the chip {{had yet to be}} tested and built before the prototype was constructed. The chip was finished {{in the latter half of}} 1974, and was, at the time, the highest-performing chip used in a consumer product.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} wasp, {{including}} especially the cuckoo or jewel wasps (Chrysididae), are kleptoparasites, laying their {{eggs in the}} nests of other wasp species to exploit their parental care. Most such species attack hosts that provide provisions for their immature stages (such as paralyzed prey items), and they either consume the provisions intended for the host larva, or wait for the host to develop and then consume it before it reaches adulthood. An example of a true brood parasite is the paper wasp Polistes sulcifer, which lays its eggs in the nests of other paper wasps (specifically Polistes dominula), and whose larvae are then fed directly by the host. Sand wasps Ammophila often <b>save</b> <b>time</b> and energy by parasitising the nests of other females of their own species, either kleptoparasitically stealing prey, or as brood parasites, removing the other female's egg from the prey and laying their own in its place. According to Emery's rule, social parasites, especially among insects, tend to parasitise species or genera {{to which they are}} closely related. For example, the social wasp Dolichovespula adulterina parasitises other members of its genus such as D. norwegica and D. arenaria.|$|E

5|$|The {{localization}} {{proved more}} challenging than other Atlus projects for multiple reasons. As the characters' text bubbles {{were designed to}} use Japanese kanji characters—which compress {{a lot of information}} into a single symbol in a way impossible in the English alphabet—each text bubble had to be individually resized and sometimes shifted so they would not intrude on other elements within scenes. The sheer amount of voice acting in the game meant that dubbing took far longer than other similar projects, running past its projected time and requiring Atlus staff members to voice very minor characters to <b>save</b> <b>time.</b> The main characters were a major focus due to the storytelling style of multiple interlinked narratives, with each character's personal growth needing to be reflected in their voice performance. This was particularly true of Mercedes. The auto-scrolling nature of dialogue, which moved along at a set pace rather than through the player's button prompts, meant that performances needed to be correctly timed and balanced to the varying paces at which the actors read their lines. This led to lines being modified during recording to keep within schedule. During the last stages, the team needed to rerecord some lines of dialogue, but to keep the localization in budget and on schedule it was done outside a professional recording studio, resulting in an audible drop in quality.|$|E
