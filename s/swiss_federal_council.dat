5|$|In the 1970s green {{became the}} color of the third biggest <b>Swiss</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> {{political}} party, the Swiss People's Party SVP. The ideology is Swiss nationalism, national conservatism, right-wing populism, economic liberalism, agrarianism, isolationism, euroscepticism. The SVP was founded on September 22, 1971 and has 90,000 members.|$|E
5|$|Military trials with {{civilian}} airplanes {{were first}} conducted in 1911, resulting in many crashes {{that failed to}} persuade Swiss authorities of the military utility of the airplane. From September 4 to 6, 1911, Failloubaz participated as pilot (his friend Gustave Lecoultre as observer) to an exercise with the 1st Swiss Army Corps and demonstrated the military possibilities of aircraft with his Dufaux 5; {{the beginning of the}} military aviation in Switzerland. Only after the Swiss Officers' Society collected approximately 1,723,000Swiss francs in 1912– a very large sum for the time – in a national fund drive to the create an air force, did the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> order the establishment of a Fliegerabteilung on 3 August 1914. The government also decreed that only bachelors could become military pilots, to avoid the payment of expensive widow's pensions in the event of casualties.|$|E
5|$|The EU's {{institutional}} set up is also {{somewhat similar}} {{to the government of}} Switzerland (which, although in Europe, is not an EU member state). The Swiss consensus-driven system is seen as successfully uniting a state divided by language and religion, although the EU was not directly modelled on the Swiss system despite bearing a number of similarities. The European Commission has similarities to the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> in that both have all-party representation and are appointed on the basis of nationality rather than popularity. The President of the Federal Council rotates between its members each year, in a fashion {{similar to that of the}} EU's Council Presidency. Due to this system of presidency Swiss leaders, like those of the EU, are relatively unknown with national politics viewed as somewhat technocratic resulting in low voter turnout, in a similar fashion to that of the European Parliament. Other parallels include the jealously guarded powers of states, the considerable level of translation and the choice of a lesser city as the capital.|$|E
50|$|Due to the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Council's</b> early 1866 {{decision}} to equip the army with a breechloading repeating rifle, the Vetterli rifles were, {{at the time}} of their introduction, the most advanced military rifles in Europe. The Vetterli was the replacement for the Eidgenössischer Stutzer 1851, an Amsler-Milbank metallic cartridge conversion from previous Swiss muzzle-loading rifles.|$|R
50|$|Franscini was {{the fifth}} {{candidate}} proposed during the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Council's</b> first election which was held by the newborn Federal Assembly on 16 November 1848. He was elected in the third round, receiving 68 out of 135 valid votes - only one vote above the required absolute majority and the weakest result among the first seven members of the Federal Council.For his entire tenure of eight years, Franscini supervised the Federal Department of Home Affairs. The constitution of 1848 granted the cantons far more autonomy than later revisions after 1874 would ever allow again, and the department's defined scope of responsibility was very small in comparison to what it would become later. Its primary focus was to organize the federal chancellory and federal archive. Other official duties included the collection of statistical data, supervision of religious rights and peace between confessions, sanitary measures in case of epidemic disease, and the standardization of weights and measurement.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} promote the {{diffusion}} of insurance contracts with managed care characteristics among <b>Swiss</b> citizens the <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> suggests that Parliament defines networks of integrated care (with budgetary responsibility) {{as part of the}} federal law on social health insurance.

25|$|When Federal Councillor Adolf Deucher died in 1912, Calonder {{was one of}} the {{candidates}} for the vacant seat in the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Council.</b> On July 17, 1912, he lost the election to Edmund Schulthess in the first vote, partially due to Schulthess's strong support by Catholic Conservatives, farmers' organizations, and the industrial lobby. Disappointed by the result, Grison politicians and media called for a boycott of the Swiss National Day (August 1) in 1912.|$|E
