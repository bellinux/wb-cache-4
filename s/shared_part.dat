5|$|Directed acyclic graphs {{may also}} be used as a compact {{representation}} of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences can be represented by a <b>shared</b> <b>part</b> of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie. A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex.|$|E
5|$|The player {{continues}} to {{journey into the}} remains of a once sprawling city {{at the base of the}} mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the traveler begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the crevice still a fair distance away, the traveler falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear before the character and grant the traveler new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into the crevice as the screen fills with white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic scene. This scene shows a shooting star emanating from the crevice and traversing the path the traveler took through the ruins, and shows glimpses of other robed travelers heading towards the mountain. Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again. As the credits end, the player is shown the PlayStation Network IDs of the other travelers who <b>shared</b> <b>part</b> of the trek.|$|E

25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the social sharing of emotions extends beyond just the realm of psychology; it also has been considered {{in the context of}} anthropology. Because an emotional episode is shared with a group of people, it becomes part of a shared knowledge within that group. As discussed above, knowledge of an event experienced by a single person can extend to more than 50 people via secondary and tertiary social sharing, thus the event has become a <b>shared</b> <b>part</b> of a relatively large group of people. Yet, an event can be extended to even larger groups of people, perhaps even whole communities or even nations, when the event is very intense one or when many people concurrently experience the event.|$|E

500|$|The College {{was based}} in Adams Hall, where {{students}} and their advisers lived and worked by the shore of Lake Mendota (except for Meiklejohn, {{who lived in a}} large house several blocks away). Adams Hall was constructed in 1926, with a Renaissance-style quad and eight identical divisions, each with its own common room, den, and facilities for 30 students, two advisers, and a fellow. The surrounding facilities afforded abundant sporting opportunities, and the site offered distance from the city and university. The students <b>shared</b> <b>part</b> of Adams Hall with non-Experimental College students, and the nearby common dining hall with the UW students in Tripp Hall. The other students were said to be bothered by the Experimental College's disregard for property, rambunctiousness, noise, and dining hall biscuit fights.|$|E
