25|$|In {{his books}} The <b>Sacred</b> <b>Mushroom</b> and the Cross (1970) and The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth (1979), the British {{archaeologist}} and philologist John M. Allegro advanced {{the theory that}} stories of early Christianity originated in a shamanistic Essene clandestine cult centered around the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms. He also argued {{that the story of}} Jesus was based on the crucifixion of the Teacher of Righteousness in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Allegro's theory was criticised sharply by Welsh historian Philip Jenkins, who wrote that Allegro relied on texts that did not exist in quite the form he was citing them. Based on this and many other negative reactions to the book, Allegro's publisher later apologized for issuing the book and Allegro was forced to resign his academic post.|$|E

50|$|During late 90s he {{published}} the book: “Hongos medicinales y sagrados de México” (“Medicinal and <b>sacred</b> <b>mushrooms</b> of Mexico”) and collaborated in {{the characterization of}} microscopic fungal diversity and abundance from several beaches in Mexico from the states of Veracruz, Quintana Roo and Colima, covering the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea; they reported a total of 52 species.|$|R

500|$|The {{species was}} first {{reported}} by French mycologist Roger Heim in 1956 as {{a variety of}} Psilocybe mexicana before he officially described it under its current name a year later. Named for its association with the Nahua people also called Aztecs, P.aztecorum {{may have been one}} of the <b>sacred</b> <b>mushroom</b> species, or teonanácatl (A Nahuatl word translated variously as [...] "sacred mushroom" [...] or [...] "flesh of the gods"), reported in the codices of 16th-century Spanish chronicler Bernardino de Sahagún. The mushrooms are still used for spiritual ceremonies by Nahua Indians in the Popocatépetl region, although this traditional usage is waning. The variety P.aztecorum var. bonetii has smaller spores than the main variety, and is found at lower elevations with Montezuma pine (Pinus montezumae) and sacred fir (Abies religiosa). P.aztecorum may be distinguished from similar temperate species such as P.baeocystis and P.quebecensis by their ranges, and by differences in the morphology of microscopic structures like cystidia.|$|E
500|$|Philologist, archeologist, and Dead Sea Scrolls scholar John Marco Allegro {{postulated}} that early Christian theology {{was derived from}} a fertility cult revolving around the entheogenic consumption of A. muscaria in his 1970 book The <b>Sacred</b> <b>Mushroom</b> and the Cross, but his theory has found little support by scholars outside the field of ethnomycology. The book was roundly discredited by academics and theologians, including Sir Godfrey Driver, Emeritus Professor of Semitic Philology at Oxford University, and Henry Chadwick, the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford. Christian author John C. King wrote a detailed rebuttal of Allegro's theory in the 1970 book A Christian View of the Mushroom Myth; he notes that neither fly agarics nor their host trees {{are found in the}} Middle East, even though cedars and pines are found there, and highlights the tenuous nature of the links between biblical and Sumerian names coined by Allegro. He concludes that if the theory were true, the use of the mushroom must have been [...] "the best kept secret in the world" [...] as it was so well concealed for two thousand years.|$|E

50|$|Motifs from Mesopotamian mythology {{are widely}} {{represented}} in the book by various references, symbolic coincidences and the final denouement. The most prominent image is the one of Ishtar - goddess, feminine origin related to Venus. It's the most constant and significant theme, the rest appears as a support for it. The idea beneath the motif of Mesopotamian Mythology seem to serve the purpose of deification of advertising as {{in the end the}} most powerful media corporation appears to be a Chaldean Guild sustaining (preserving) the balance between good and evil by means of deft informational manipulations. Tatarsky's experimenting with fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria species) that give him creative inspiration also has mythological background - fly agarics are <b>sacred</b> <b>mushrooms</b> of Ishtar, consequently it looks like the goddess inspires him. Tatarsky's name also bears a sign of symbolism - Vavilen, apart from being an acronym from the names of Vasily Aksyonov and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, can also be interpreted as a variation of the word Babylon, or Vavilon in Russian.|$|R

The Mazatec people from the northern highlands of the Mexican State of Oaxaca are known for the syncretism of their religion, which combines pre-Hispanic culture and Catholic religion introduced with Spanish colonization in the sixteenth century. Nowadays, Mazatec religious practices are characterized by ritual ceremonies revolving around the religious spirit of the people and their cosmology. They are known for using mushrooms and other hallucinogenic plants to connect them with the world of their gods. The sacredness of these mushrooms is such a large and complex topic that no attempt at scientific explanation seems to solve all of the magical mysteries of the Mazatec universe. However, my introduction to it began in 2011 when I was carrying out fieldwork among the Mazatec people as part of my Ph. D. studies in architecture. This article is a direct account of an experience I had that seems to go beyond rational parameters; to a place where the spiritual and magical predominate; to a world in which healers and shamans eat <b>sacred</b> <b>mushrooms</b> in order to perform ceremonial rituals to heal people...|$|R
500|$|According to ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson, P.indusiatus was {{consumed}} in Mexican divinatory ceremonies {{on account of}} its suggestive shape. On {{the other side of}} the globe, New Guinea natives consider the <b>mushroom</b> <b>sacred.</b> In Nigeria, the mushroom is one of several stinkhorns given the name Akufodewa by the Yoruba people. The name is derived from a combination of the Yoruba words ku ("die"), fun ("for"), ode ("hunter"), and wa ("search"), and refers to how the mushroom's stench can attract hunters who mistake its odour for that of a dead animal. The Yoruba have been reported to have used it as a component of a charm to make hunters less visible in times of danger. In other parts of Nigeria, they have been used in the preparation of harmful charms by ethnic groups such as the Urhobo [...] and the Ibibio people. The Igbo people of east-central Nigeria called stinkhorns éró ḿma, from the Igbo words for [...] "mushroom" [...] and [...] "beauty".|$|R

5000|$|Hallucinogenic {{species of}} the Psilocybe genus {{have a history of}} use among the native peoples of Mesoamerica for {{religious}} communion, divination, and healing, from pre-Columbian times to the present day. Mushroom stones and motifs have been found in Guatemala. A statuette dating from ca. 200 AD and depicting a mushroom strongly resembling Psilocybe mexicana was found in a west Mexican shaft and chamber tomb in the state of Colima. A Psilocybe species was known to the Aztecs as teonanácatl (literally [...] "divine mushroom" [...] - agglutinative form of teó (god, <b>sacred)</b> and nanácatl (<b>mushroom)</b> in Náhuatl) and were reportedly served at the coronation of the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II in 1502. Aztecs and Mazatecs referred to psilocybin mushrooms as genius mushrooms, divinatory mushrooms, and wondrous mushrooms, when translated into English. Bernardino de Sahagún reported ritualistic use of teonanácatl by the Aztecs, when he traveled to Central America after the expedition of Hernán Cortés.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{excavators}} of {{the sanctuary}} of the Great Gods {{on the island of}} Samothrace recognize that drinking to the point of intoxication was practiced at the Mystery, naively this has not been seen as an element in the initiation scenario. Numerous drinking cups have been found, inscribed as the property of the gods, and the ancient village of Keramidaria (‘Ceramics’) was devoted to the manufacture of amphorae, officially stamped as genuine provenance of Samothrace for the export of the wine distinctive of the Mystery, probably a version of Homer’s potent Maronian wine of the Cyclops. That wine still existed in the Roman Period, and on the testimony of the proconsul assigned to the province, it even required dilution with eight parts water to be drunk safely. At the time of Odysseus, the rate of dilution was twentyfold. Such potent wines achieved their high intoxicating potential from the substances added to the ferment, a fact that has now been confirmed by the discovery of an intact wine cellar from Canaan, dated {{to the beginning of the}} second millennium BCE. The myth of the establishment of the Mystery, dated to the generations before the Trojan War, narrates the tale of its founder sailing like a drunken loon upon a wineskin, and similar establishments of the Mystery of the Great Gods depict a Kabeiric dwarfish Odysseus sailing upon an amphora filled with the special potion of the great sorceress Circe. This wine was fortified with a <b>sacred</b> psychoactive <b>mushroom,</b> whose antiquity can be traced back to the wolf sacrament of the Achaemenid Persians, and documented as well in Celtic lore and among the Nordic berserkers, recorded as early as the Emperor Trajan as a rite of the Dacians of Thrace, who are named as the ‘People of the Wolf’ and who carried the banner of Draco into battle, a serpent with the head of a wolf. The serpent is an indication of the wolf’s toxicity, and the fondness of wolves for eating the mushrooms was the basis for the rituals of lycanthropy and the initiated fraternal packs of warriors. In Athens of the Classical Age, the fungal identity of this initiatory sacrament was common knowledge, obscenely parodied on the comic stage. The Etruscans carried this sacrament to the Italian peninsula and it was incorporated into the mythologized history of Rome’s founding by the Trojan Aeneas as the fulfillment of the prophecy of the edible tables that would signal the site for the future city. The cult of the Great Gods involved the widespread phenomenon of the little people that materialized from the sacramental fungus as fairy creatures, using the mushroom as their tables set with dainty morsels that inspired visionary experience and of which it was taboo for the uninitiated to partake...|$|R

5000|$|Allegro's {{theory of}} a shamanistic cult as {{the origin of}} Christianity was criticised sharply by Welsh {{historian}} Philip Jenkins who wrote that Allegro was an eccentric scholar who relied on texts {{that did not exist}} in quite the form he was citing them.

Based on the reactions to the book, Allegro's publisher later apologized for issuing the book and Allegro was forced to resign his academic post. A 2006 article discussing Allegro's work called for his theories to be re-evaluated by the mainstream.

50|$|Allegro's book The <b>Sacred</b> <b>Mushroom</b> and the Cross (1970) {{argued that}} Christianity {{began as a}} shamanistic cult. In his books The <b>Sacred</b> <b>Mushroom</b> and the Cross and The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth (1979), Allegro put forward the theory that stories of early Christianity {{originated}} in an Essene clandestine cult centred around the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms, and that the New Testament is the coded record of this shamanistic cult. Allegro further argued that {{the authors of the}} Christian gospels did not understand the Essene thought. When writing down the Gospels based on the stories they had heard, the evangelists confused the meaning of the scrolls. In this way, according to Allegro, the Christian tradition is based on a misunderstanding of the scrolls. He also argued that the story of Jesus was based on the crucifixion of the Teacher of Righteousness in the scrolls. Mark Hall writes that Allegro suggested the Dead Sea Scrolls all but proved that a historical Jesus never existed.|$|E
50|$|John Marco Allegro (17 February 1923 - 17 February 1988) was an English {{archaeologist}} and Dead Sea Scrolls scholar. He was a populariser of the Dead Sea Scrolls {{through his}} books and radio broadcasts. He was the editor {{of some of the}} most famous and controversial scrolls published, the pesharim. A number of Allegro's later books, including The <b>Sacred</b> <b>Mushroom</b> and the Cross, brought him both popular fame and notoriety, and also destroyed his career.|$|E
5000|$|Allegro {{argued that}} Jesus in the Gospels {{was in fact}} a code for a type of hallucinogen, the Amanita muscaria, and that Christianity was the product of an ancient [...] "sex-and-mushroom" [...] cult. Critical {{reaction}} was swift and harsh: fourteen British scholars (including Allegro's mentor at Oxford, Godfrey Driver) denounced it. Sidnie White Crawford wrote of the publication of <b>Sacred</b> <b>Mushroom,</b> [...] "Rightly or wrongly, Allegro would never be taken seriously as a scholar again." ...|$|E
50|$|Conocybe siligineoides, {{also known}} as cone caps, Ya'nte, Ta'a'ya, or Tamu, is a species of macro-fungus in the family Bolbitiaceae. It has seldom been {{observed}} by the mycological community with all specimens having been collected in Mexico. Originally reported as a <b>sacred</b> <b>mushroom,</b> no chemical studies have been undertaken on this species although {{other members of the}} same genus have been shown to contain psilocybin, which causes strong hallucinations. They are crushed, dried, and used in tea, and consumed fresh also.|$|E
50|$|Philologist John Marco Allegro {{has argued}} {{in his book}} The <b>Sacred</b> <b>Mushroom</b> and the Cross that early Jewish and Christian cultic {{practice}} {{was based on the}} use of Amanita muscaria, which was later forgotten by its adherents. Allegro's hypothesis is that Amanita use was sacred knowledge kept only by high figures to hide the true beginnings of the Christian cult, seems supported by his own view that the Plaincourault Chapel shows evidence of Christian amanita use in the 13th century.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies of}} Allegro's work have given new purported {{evidence}} {{and led to}} calls for his theories to be re-evaluated by the mainstream. In November 2009 The <b>Sacred</b> <b>Mushroom</b> and the Cross was reprinted in a 40th anniversary edition with 30-page addendum by Prof. Carl A. P. Ruck of Boston University.

5000|$|The band {{originated}} {{from the garage}} rock outfit, C. C. and the Chasers, who became the house band at the Unicorn Coffeehouse in Boston, and released an obscure single, [...] "Put the Clock Back on the Wall", for the small Cori label, in 1964. The first line-up consisted of Ted Demos (lead guitar), Joe Castagno (rhythm guitar), Richard Barnaby (bass guitar), Jeff Labes (keyboards), and Jack Bruno (drums), all of whom shared vocals duties. After relocating, briefly, in 1965, to New York City the group adopted the moniker, <b>Sacred</b> <b>Mushroom,</b> and dwelled in psychedelic music. They, again, became a house band, this time for the Bitter End Cafe, and supporting musical acts such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell. The band recruited female singer Anne Tansey, who Labes described as [...] "a powerhouse, kind of a Janis Joplin with a sweeter voice, but sultry dynamic energy." [...] Her connections {{in the music industry}} were responsible for finding their manager Marv Lagunoff and the groups signing to a record label. As a deal with Atlantic Records was pending, the name <b>Sacred</b> <b>Mushroom</b> was deemed too drug-orientated, and, after a humorous remark by Demos, the band was prompted to change it to Apple Pie Motherhood Band in 1967.|$|E
50|$|By August 1973, {{the band}} members were in Cincinnati and managed to persuade Call to return. Fuller, though out of prison by now, was working the late shift in a {{community}} hospital to satisfy his C.O. requirements and was not inclined to rejoin at that time. He was eventually given a full pardon by President Gerald Ford. Reilly took over as the band's leader and brought in his friend Larry Goshorn (vocals, guitars) to replace Fuller in November 1973. Goshorn played in a popular Ohio band called The <b>Sacred</b> <b>Mushroom.</b>|$|E

50|$|Herodotus {{mentions}} {{a legendary}} 'City of Dionysus' {{lost in the}} desert sands, {{which may be the}} origin of the Zerzura legend. The Greek god Dionysus is associated with the Eleusinian mystery cult of ancient Greece, based on the use of an entheogenic plant: origins of <b>sacred</b> <b>mushroom</b> cults have been traced by scholars to the Sahara, in particular the Tassili-n-Ajjer area of Algeria, which boasts rock-painting dated as early as 10,000 BC. Some of these paintings apparently show shaman-figures toting mushrooms, and experiencing a shamanic trance. (Ref. Food of the Gods, by Terence McKenna.) The 'City of Dionysus' myth may be a dim memory of this forgotten cult.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} main stages inside the hall, {{with a smaller}} central stage {{designed}} for poets, performance artists, jugglers, dancers including The Tribe of the <b>Sacred</b> <b>Mushroom),</b> Philippine dancer David Medalla and The Exploding Galaxy Dance Troupe.
