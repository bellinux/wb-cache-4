5000|$|Typically, {{a college}} would {{have two or}} more {{competing}} societies. The campus societies were generally intense competitors. Some examples include the Philodemic and Philonomosian <b>Societies</b> <b>at</b> Georgetown University, the American Whig and Cliosophic <b>Societies</b> <b>at</b> Princeton University, Social Friends and United Fraternity at Dartmouth College, the Philorhetorian and Peithologian <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> Wesleyan University, the Philologian and Philotechnian <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> Williams College, the Philomathean and Zelosophic <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> the University of Pennsylvania, the Philolexian and Peithologian <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> Columbia University, the Clariosophic, Euphradian, and the Euphrosynean <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> the University of South Carolina, the Phi Kappa and Demosthenian <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> the University of Georgia, the Linonia and Brothers in Unity at Yale University, the Miami Union and Erodelphian (previously Adelphic) <b>societies</b> <b>at</b> Miami University and Dialectic and Philanthropic <b>Societies</b> <b>at</b> the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. These societies were usually in a limited adversarial role; at Columbia University the Peithologian and Philolexian were competitors, and they maintained a rivalry that was friendly at best and highly charged at worst. In his famous diary, George Templeton Strong recorded that a Philolexian gathering was disrupted by [...] "those rascally Peithologians"; and firecrackers and stink bombs, tossed into the midst of each other's meetings, were usually the weapons of choice.|$|R

5|$|A Free Ride {{was first}} shown to its target {{audience}} in 1915. At that time, {{it was not}} possible to screen stag films in public theaters due to the Victorian moral views of contemporary society. Like other pornographic films of that era, A Free Ride was released and circulated underground to avoid censorship. It was likely shown in brothels, gentlemen's clubs, illegal gatherings of men in public places, stag parties, and other all-male venues: the film was kept hidden from <b>society</b> <b>at</b> large and the government.|$|E
5|$|As a {{reflection}} of categories of sexuality so sharply defined {{by the government and}} <b>society</b> <b>at</b> large, lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women, particularly among the working class in the U.S. and Canada. Although many municipalities had enacted laws against cross-dressing, some women would socialize in bars as butches: dressed in men's clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed a more diminutive role as femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between the two would be ignored, or at least unable to date anyone, and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.|$|E

To produce these forecasts an extensive suite of forecasting tools was developed, including a multimodel ensemble approach that required thorough validation of each model's accuracy level in simulating interannual climate variability.|$|E

5|$|HIAG {{embraced the}} Suchdienst activities, {{not only because}} it was {{concerned}} for the fate of some 40,000 members of the Waffen-SS who were missing in action, but because this outwardly humanitarian and non-political activity could help improve its perception by the West German government and the <b>society</b> <b>at</b> large. Such public relations activities ("image polishing", according to Large) were important to HIAG as it faced on-going scrutiny, and even calls for a ban on the organisation. The Suchdiensttreffen events (literally: tracing service meetings) later evolved into annual Kameradschaftstreffen ("veterans' reunions"), which were large-scale conventions, often accompanied by rallies.|$|E
5|$|Harry became {{interested}} in science fiction and read comics by candlelight (as the house had no electricity), eventually joining the Liverpool Science Fiction <b>Society.</b> <b>At</b> the age of 13, he produced his own science fiction fanzine, Biped, using a Gestetner machine to print 60 copies.

5|$|Homing pigeons {{were used}} {{extensively}} in the 19th and early 20thcenturies, both for civil pigeon post and as war pigeons. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the famous pigeon post of Paris carried up to 50,000microfilmed telegrams per pigeon flight from Tours into the besieged capital. Altogether 150,000 individual private telegrams and state dispatches were delivered. In an 1889 experiment of the Imperial Russian Technical <b>Society</b> <b>at</b> Saint Petersburg, {{the chief of the}} Russian balloon corps took aerial photographs from a balloon and sent the developed collodion film negatives to the ground by pigeon post.|$|E

5|$|In 1282, Michael Palaeologus {{died and}} his son Andronicus II took power. The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the <b>society</b> <b>at</b> large; his policy of Latin {{appeasement}} to the Church in Rome, heavy taxation and military expenditure placed a severe burden on the people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking land from the Empire, they were seen as liberators of Anatolians and many soon converted to Islam undermining the Byzantine's Orthodox power base.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, Rae {{travelled}} to France {{and settled}} in Paris with her mother Janet and sister Alison.

During this initial part of her career, Rae exhibited works in Australia and New Zealand, though she remained in Europe.

5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Renaissance <b>Society</b> <b>at</b> the University of Chicago, Rashid Johnson exhibited The Evolution of the Negro Political Costume in December 2004. He presented replicas of three outfits worn by African-American politicians. He included a late 1960s dashiki worn by Jesse Jackson, a 1980s running suit worn by Al Sharpton in the '80s and a business suit worn by then United States Senator-elect Barack Obama. The presentation, which invited inspection, was as likely to evoke humorous response to the Jackson dashika as well as critical commentary about the presentation of political attire.|$|E
5|$|Keen {{to follow}} up his {{interest}} in aviation, Johnson started taking flying lessons at his own expense. He applied to join the Auxiliary Air Force (AAF) but encountered some of the social problems that were rife in British <b>society</b> <b>at</b> the time.

As the chances of war increased {{in the aftermath of the}} Munich Crisis, the standards of the RAF were relaxed, however, as the service expanded and brought in men from ordinary social backgrounds. Johnson re-applied to the AAF. He was informed that sufficient pilots were already available but there were some vacancies in the balloon squadrons. Johnson rejected the offer.|$|E
