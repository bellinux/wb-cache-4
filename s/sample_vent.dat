We compared a subset of their bacteriophage population by Sanger- and 454 -sequencing of g 23, which codes for the major capsid protein of T 4 likeviruses. We found that the sites differ vastly in their bacteriophage diversity, which reflects the differences in the chemical conditions and therefore putatively the differences in microbial hosts living at these sites. Comparing phage diversity in the <b>vent</b> <b>samples</b> to other aquatic <b>samples,</b> the <b>vent</b> <b>samples</b> formed a distinct separate cluster, which also included the non-vent control samples that were taken several hundred meters above the vent chimneys.

40|$|International audienceHydrothermal vents are deep-sea {{ecosystems}} {{that are}} almost exclusively known and explored by scientists rather than the general public. Continuing scientific discoveries arising from study of hydrothermal vents are concommitant with the increased number of scientific cruises visiting and <b>sampling</b> <b>vent</b> ecosystems. Through a bibliometric analysis, we assessed the scientific value of hydrothermal vents relative {{to two of the}} most well-studied marine ecosystems, coral reefs and seagrass beds. Scientific literature on hydrothermal vents is abundant, of high impact, international, and interdisciplinary and is comparable in these regards with literature on coral reefs and seagrass beds. Scientists may affect hydrothermal vents because their activities are intense and spatially and temporally concentrated in these small systems. The potential for undesirable effects from scientific enterprise motivated the creation of a code of conduct for environmentally and scientifically benign use of hydrothermal vents for research. We surveyed scientists worldwide engaged in deep-sea research and found that scientists were aware of the code of conduct and thought it was relevant to conservation, but they did not feel informed or confident about the respect other researchers have for the code. Although this code may serve as a reminder of scientists' environmental responsibilities, conservation of particular vents (e. g., closures to human activity, specific human management) may effectively ensure sustainable use of vent ecosystems for all stakeholders...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the connectivity of three populations of the ‘scaly-foot gastropod’ (Chrysomallon squamiferum Chen et al., 2015), a species endemic to hydrothermal vents in the Indian Ocean, amongst two vent fields on the Central Indian Ridge (CIR) and Longqi field, the first <b>sampled</b> <b>vent</b> field on the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR). Connectivity and population structure across the two mid-oceanic ridges were investigated using a 489 -bp fragment of the cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) gene. Phylogeographical approaches used include measures of genetic differentiation (F ST), reconstruction of parsimony haplotype network, mismatch analyses and neutrality tests. Relative migrants per generation were estimated between the fields. Significant differentiation (F ST?=? 0. 28 – 0. 29, P?<? 0. 001) was revealed between the vent field in SWIR and the two in CIR. Signatures were detected indicating recent bottleneck events followed by demographic expansion in all populations. Estimates of relative number of migrants were relatively low between the SWIR and CIR, compared with values between the CIR vent fields. The present study is the first to investigate connectivity between hydrothermal vents across two mid-ocean ridges in the Indian Ocean.

40|$|The Hanford Site in {{southern}} Washington contains {{a large proportion}} of the 250, 000 metric tons of nitrate estimated to reside at DOE sites across the USA. Nitrate concentrations > 600 mg/L have been reported for Hanford groundwaters, where nitrate commonly accompanies elevated levels of radionuclide contamination. Much of the Hanford nitrate is stored in the vadose zone, where complicated hydrology and poorly understood chemical and biochemical processes lead to uncertain fate and transport. Analysis of the nitrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of nitrate provides a promising method to identify sources and investigate biochemical degradation of nitrate in the subsurface at Hanford. A preliminary investigation of NO 3 - fate and transport at the Hanford Site focuses on pore water nitrate, extracted by 1 : 1 sediment to DI water rinses of vadose zone sediments, in a vertical profile through a radionuclide plume at the TX-TY tank farm, and compares these results with transects across major nitrate plumes in the Hanford unconfined aquifer. Until recently, methods for analyzing d 15 N and d 18 O of NO 3 - in waters were unwieldy for routine analyses of dilute groundwaters and pore water extracts from vadose zone sediments; however, Sigman, et al., 2001 (Anal. Chem) and Casciotti, et al., 2002 (Anal. Chem), developed a method using denitrifying bacteria with a truncated enzymatic pathway to generate N 2 O for analyzing both isotopes simultaneously from NO 3 - in dilute samples. Our modifications to this method decrease both culture preparation and sample processing times. Culturing time has been reduced to 2 - 3 days by increasing the initial inoculation volume to 2 mL in 100 mL. We grow cultures on a bench top and mix by inversion twice daily, instead of growing on a constant shaking unit. These changes have not been shown to affect the cell yield nor the N 2 O levels in blanks. Secondly, cell preparation for NO 3 - reduction has been modified to decrease sample processing time. Intense centrifugation was found to be unnecessary and loose pellet formation at a lower g is more than adequate. We found no detectable background level of N 2 O in the cultures, and have reduced the <b>sample</b> <b>venting</b> time. Lastly, we have found that samples can be injected, cells lysed, and N 2 O run in the same day with negligible affects to N 2 O yield and d 15 N/d 18 O values...|$|R
40|$|The Assembly Transfer System (ATS) receives, cools, {{and opens}} rail and truck {{transportation}} casks from the Carrier/Cask Handling System (CCHS). The system unloads transportation casks consisting of bare Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) assemblies, single element canisters, and Dual Purpose Canisters (DPCs). For casks containing DPCs, the system opens the DPCs and unloads the SNF. The system stages the assemblies, transfer assemblies {{to and from}} fuel-blending inventory pools, loads them into Disposal Containers (DCs), temporarily seals and inerts the DC, decontaminates the DC and transfers it to the Disposal Container Handling System. The system also prepares empty casks and DPCs for off-site shipment. Two identical Assembly Transfer System lines are provided in the Waste Handling Building (WHB). Each line operates independently to handle the waste transfer throughput and to support maintenance operations. Each system line primarily consists of wet and dry handling areas. The wet handling area includes a cask transport system, cask and DPC preparation system, and a wet assembly handling system. The basket transport system forms the transition between the wet and dry handling areas. The dry handling area includes the dry assembly handling system, assembly drying system, DC preparation system, and DC transport system. Both the wet and dry handling areas are controlled by the control and tracking system. The system operating sequence begins with moving transportation casks to the cask preparation area. The cask preparation operations consist of cask cavity gas <b>sampling,</b> cask <b>venting,</b> cask cool-down, outer lid removal, and inner shield plug lifting fixture attachment. Casks containing bare SNF (no DPC) are filled with water {{and placed in the}} cask unloading pool. The inner shield plugs are removed underwater. For casks containing a DPC, the cask lid(s) is removed, and the DPC is penetrated, <b>sampled,</b> <b>vented,</b> and cooled. A DPC lifting fixture is attached and the cask is placed into the cask unloading pool. In the cask unloading pool the DPC is removed from the cask and placed in an overpack and the DPC lid is severed and removed. Assemblies are removed from either an open cask or DPC and loaded into assembly baskets positioned in the basket staging rack in the assembly unloading pool. A method called ''blending'' is utilized to load DCs with a heat output of less than 11. 8 kW. This involves combining hotter and cooler assemblies from different baskets. Blending requires storing some of the hotter fuel assemblies in fuel-blending inventory pools until cooler assemblies are available. The assembly baskets are then transferred from the basket staging rack to the assembly handling cell and loaded into the assembly drying vessels. After drying, the assemblies are removed from the assembly drying vessels and loaded into a DC positioned below the DC load port. After installation of a DC inner lid and temporary sealing device, the DC is transferred to the DC decontamination cell where the top area of the DC, the DC lifting collar, and the DC inner lid and temporary sealing device are decontaminated, and the DC is evacuated and backfilled with inert gas to prevent prolonged clad exposure to air. The DC is then transferred to the Disposal Container Handling System for lid welding. In another cask preparation and decontamination area, lids are replaced on the empty transportation casks and DPC overpacks, the casks and DPC overpacks are decontaminated, inspected, and transferred to the Carrier/Cask Handling System for shipment off-site. All system equipment is designed to facilitate manual or remote operation, decontamination, and maintenance. The system interfaces with the Carrier/Cask Handling System for incoming and outgoing transportation casks and DPCs. The system also interfaces with the Disposal Container Handling System, which prepares the DC for loading and subsequently seals the loaded DC. The system support interfaces are the Waste Handling Building System and other internal WHB support systems...|$|R

40|$|Fluid venting {{from the}} toe of the accretionary prism off Oregon was {{measured}} in situ during a series of dives with DSRV Alvin in 1987 and 1988. A benthic chamber was placed over active vent sites to sequentially collect <b>samples</b> of <b>venting</b> fluids and to make direct measurements of discharge rates. Calibrated flow meter measurements and flow rates determined from dissolved methane transfer indicate that discharge from two vent sites, Alvin 1428 and Alvin 1900, ranges roughly between 100 and 500 L m− 2 d− 1. with the most reliable estimates falling {{in the range of}} 125 – 150 L m− 2 d− 1. These rates imply subsurface advective flow on the order of 100 m yr− 1. Comparison of observed discharge rates with rates calculated for steady state expulsion supported by accretion-related compaction indicates that the observed flow is greater than predicted flow by several orders of magnitude.

40|$|The abundance, diversity, activity, and {{composition}} of microbial communities in sulfide structures both of active and inactive vents were investigated by culture-independent methods. These sulfide structures were collected at four hydrothermal fields, both on- and off-axis of the back-arc spreading center of the Southern Mariana Trough. The microbial abundance and activity in the samples were determined by analyzing total organic content, enzymatic activity, and copy number of the 16 S rRNA gene. To assess the diversity {{and composition}} of the microbial communities, 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries including bacterial and archaeal phylotypes were constructed from the sulfide structures. Despite {{the differences in the}} geological settings among the sampling points, phylotypes related to the Epsilonproteobacteria and cultured hyperthermophilic archaea were abundant in the libraries from the <b>samples</b> of active <b>vents.</b> In contrast, the relative abundance of these phylotypes was extremely low in the libraries from the <b>samples</b> of inactive <b>vents.</b> These results suggest that the composition of microbial communities within sulfide structures dramatically changes depending on the degree of hydrothermal activity, which was supported by statistical analyses. Comparative analyses suggest that the abundance, activity and diversity of microbial communities within sulfide structures of inactive vents are likely to be comparable to or higher than those in active vent structures, even though the microbial community composition is different between these two types of vents. The microbial community compositions in the sulfide structures of inactive vents were similar to those in seafloor basaltic rocks rather than those in marine sediments or the sulfide structures of active vents, suggesting that the microbial community compositions on the seafloor may be constrained by the available energy sources.

An apparatus for in-situ measurements of the secondary electron yield (SEY) of samples in the vacuum chamber of the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) has been developed in connection with EC studies for the CESR Test Accelerator program (CesrTA). The CesrTA in-situ system, in operation since 2010, allows for SEY measurements as a function of incident electron energy and angle on samples that are exposed to the accelerator environment, typically 5. 3 GeV counter-rotating beams of electrons and positrons.

40|$|The Monowai {{volcanic}} {{center is}} located at the midpoint along the ? 2, 530 -km-long Tonga-Kermadec arc system. The Monowai volcanic center is comprised of a large elongate caldera (Monowai caldera area ? 35 km 2; depth to caldera floor 1, 590 m), which has formed within an older caldera some 84 km 2 in area. To the south of this nested caldera system is a large composite volcano, Monowai cone, which rises to within ? 100 m of the sea surface and which has been volcanically active for the past several decades. Mafic volcanic rocks dominate the Monowai volcanic center; basalts are the most common rock type recovered from the cone, whereas basaltic andesites are common within the caldera. Hydrothermal plume mapping has shown at least three major hydrothermal systems associated with the caldera and cone: (1) the summit of the cone, (2) low-temperature venting (< 60 °C; Mussel Ridge) on the southwestern wall of the caldera, and (3) a deeper caldera source with higher temperature venting {{that has yet to be}} observed. The cone summit plume shows large anomalies in pH (a shift of ? 2. 00 pH units) and ? 3 He (? 358 %), and noticeable H 2 S (up to 32 ?m), and CH 4 (up to 900 nm). The summit plume is also metal rich, with elevated total dissolvable Fe (TDFe up to 4, 200 nm), TDMn (up to 412 nm), and TDFe/TDMn (up to 20. 4). Particulate samples have elevated Fe, Si, Al, and Ti consistent with addition to the hydrothermal fluid from acidic water-rock reaction. Plumes extending from ? 1, 000 - to 1, 400 -m depth provide evidence for a major hydrothermal vent system in the caldera. The caldera plume has lower values for TDFe and TDMn, although some samples show higher TDMn concentrations than the cone summit plume; caldera plume samples are also relatively gas poor (i. e., no H 2 S detected, pH shift of ? 0. 06 pH units, CH 4 concentrations up to 26 nm). The composition of the hydrothermal plumes in the caldera have higher metal contents than the <b>sampled</b> <b>vent</b> fluids along Mussel Ridge, requiring that the source of the caldera plumes is at greater depth and likely of higher temperature. Minor plumes detected as light scattering anomalies but with no 3 He anomalies down the northern flank of the Monowai caldera most likely represent remobilization of volcanic debris from the volcano flanks. We believe the Monowai volcanic center is host to a robust magmatic-hydrothermal system, with significant differences in the style and composition of venting at the cone and caldera sites. At the cone, the large shifts in pH, very high ? 3 He% values, elevated TDFe and TDFe/TDMn, and the H 2 S- and CH 4 -rich nature of the plume fluids, together with elevated Ti, P, V, S, and Al in hydrothermal particulates, indicates significant magmatic volatile ± metal contributions in the hydrothermal system coupled with aggressive acidic water-rock interaction. By contrast, the caldera has low TDFe/TDMn in hydrothermal plumes; however, elevated Al and Ti contents in caldera particulate samples, combined with the presence of alunite, pyrophyllite, sulfide minerals, and native sulfur in samples from Mussel Ridge suggest past, and perhaps recent, acid volatile-rich venting and active Fe sulfide formation in the subsurface...|$|R
40|$|Pulse intensities {{greater than}} 10 (17) Watt/cm(2) were reached at the FLASH soft X-ray laser in Hamburg, Germany, using an {{off-axis}} parabolic mirror to focus 15 fs pulses of 5 - 70 mu J energy at 13. 5 nm wavelength to a micron-sized spot. We describe {{the interaction of}} such pulses with niobium and vanadium targets and their deuterides. The beam produced craters in the solid targets, and we measured the kinetic energy of ions ejected from these craters. Ions with several keV kinetic energy were observed from craters approaching 5 mu m in depth when the sample was at best focus. We also observed the onset of saturation in both ion acceleration and ablation with pulse intensities exceeding 10 (16) W/cm(2), when the highest detected ion energies and the crater depths tend to saturate with increasing intensity. A general difficulty in working with micron and sub-micron focusing optics is finding the exact focus of the beam inside a vacuum chamber. Here we propose a direct method to measure the focal position to a resolution better than the Rayleigh length. The method {{is based on the}} correlation between the energies of ejected ions and the physical dimensions of the craters. We find that the focus position can be quickly determined from the ion time-of-flight (TOF) data as the target is scanned through the expected focal region. The method does not require external access to the <b>sample</b> or <b>venting</b> the vacuum chamber. Profile fitting employed to analyze the TOF data can extend resolution beyond the actual scanning step size. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Thermally stimulated current (TSC) {{spectroscopy}} and temperature–dependent {{dark current}} (DC) measurements {{have been applied}} to study traps and photoinduced persistent surface conduction in two hydrothermally grown bulk ZnO samples, as-grown, and annealed at 600 [*]°C in N 2 ambient for 30  min, respectively. The as-grown sample had a room-temperature (RT) resistivity of 1. 6 × 103  Ω[*]cm, mobility of 2. 1 × 102  cm 2 /V[*]s, and carrier concentration of 1. 8 × 1013  cm− 3, while the annealed sample was highly resistive, with RT resistivity of 3. 6 × 106  Ω[*]cm, mobility of 4. 4  cm 2 /V[*]s, and carrier concentration of 3. 9 × 1011  cm− 3. The as-grown sample showed strong conduction at low temperatures, which {{has been shown to}} be due to near-surface carriers in other studies. The annealed sample did not demonstrate this phenomenon. The dominant trap in the as-grown sample had an activation energy of 0. 16  eV, was strongest near the surface, and is possibly related to VZn. In the annealed sample, however, the dominant trap had an activation energy of 0. 22  eV, was of bulk nature, and is tentatively assigned to LiZn. After several routine TSC measurements, the DC for the as-grown sample increased by more than one order of magnitude at low temperatures (T 3 ̆c 180 3 ̆eK), while for the annealed sample, the DC increased by a factor of 2 at high temperatures (T 3 ̆e 200  K). These effects are generated by the TSC trap-filling illumination and can persist for many days under vacuum. At RT, the DC in the annealed sample returns to its equilibrium state if the <b>sample</b> is <b>vented</b> to air...|$|R
30|$|X-ray {{computerized}} tomography (CT) is a nondestructive technique that allows three-dimensional visualization of internal structures of samples, determined mainly by variations in their density and atomic composition. Since X-ray CT was {{developed as a}} medical imaging technique in the early 1970 s (Hounsfield, 1973), it is increasingly used and has proven useful {{in the field of}} earth sciences (e.g., Mees et al., 2003). For example, it has been used to present quantitative aperture data for three-dimensional interconnected fracture networks (Pyrak-Nolte et al., 1997), to image the internal structure of fragile sea-floor hydrothermal <b>vent</b> <b>samples</b> (Tivey and Singh, 1997), and to provide information on the physical properties of sediment cores (e.g., Orsi et al., 1994). Through the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) and the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), X-ray CT system has gained acceptance as a routine core analysis tool, and some {{attempts have been made to}} evaluate X-ray CT imaging for observation and description of core samples (e.g., Ashi, 1997; Iturrino et al., 2004; Tanaka and Nakano, 2009). However, many studies were treated X-ray CT images only as a non-invasive imaging tool.|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{information}} about mobile DNA in deep-sea hydrothermal vents limits {{our understanding of the}} phylogenetic diversity of the mobile genome of bacteria in these environments. We used culture-independent techniques to explore the diversity of the integron/mobile gene cassette system in a variety of hydrothermal <b>vent</b> communities. Three <b>samples,</b> which included two different hydrothermal vent fluids and a mussel species that contained essentially monophyletic sulfur-oxidizing bacterial endosymbionts, were collected from Suiyo Seamount, Izu-Bonin, Japan, and Pika site, Mariana arc. First, using degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, we amplified integron integrase genes from metagenomic DNA from each <b>sample.</b> From <b>vent</b> fluids, we discovered 74 new integrase genes that were classified into 11 previously undescribed integron classes. One integrase gene was recorded in the mussel symbiont and was phylogenetically distant from those recovered from vent fluids. Second, using PCR primers targeting the gene cassette recombination site (59 -be), we amplified and subsequently identified 60 diverse gene cassettes. In multicassette amplicons, a total of 13 59 -be sites were identified. Most of these sites displayed features that were atypical of the features previously well conserved in this family. The Suiyo vent fluid was characterized by gene cassette open reading frames (ORFs) that had significant homologies with transferases, DNA-binding proteins and metal transporter proteins, while the majority of Pika vent fluid gene cassettes contained novel ORFs with no identifiable homologues in databases. The symbiont gene cassette ORFs were found to be matched with DNA repair proteins, methionine aminopeptidase, aminopeptidase N, O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase and glutamate synthase, which are proteins expected {{to play a role in}} animal/symbiont metabolism. The success of this study indicates that the integron/gene cassette system is common in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, an environment type well removed from anthropogenic disturbance. 15 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This study {{introduces}} a new method for characterizing mineral-associated microbial diversity in sedimentary environments, a habitat {{that has been}} intrinsically challenging to study in regard to microbe-mineral interactions. Mineral components were enriched from bulk environmental samples by magnetic susceptibility or density separation techniques and used in subsequent molecular and microscopic analyses. Testing and optimization of the method was performed on geochemically-distinct sediment horizons from Eel River Basin methane seeps and pyrite and sphalerite-rich hydrothermal <b>vent</b> <b>samples</b> from the Lau Basin. Initial results show reproducible variations in microbial diversity between mineral fractions from marine sedimentary environments enriched in authigenic pyrite and/or transition metal-bearing clay minerals. Specifically, different archaeal clades associated with the anaerobic oxidation of methane and putative sulfate-reducing deltaproteobbacteria show preferential colonization patterns, suggesting potential ecophysiological differences between closely-related taxa. These results indicate that mineral colonization may influence the extent and distribution of microbial diversity throughout unconsolidated sediments of the marine subsurface. The combination of mineral separation and molecular analyses introduced here provide a new approach for revealing previously concealed patterns of mineral-associated microbial diversity across {{a wide range of}} environments, from hard rock habitats to fine-grained lithologies...|$|R
