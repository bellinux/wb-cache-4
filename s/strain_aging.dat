40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{addresses}} the <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> {{effects on the}} mechanical properties of the partially damaged structural mild steel. Since repairing partly damaged structures may not occur immediately, the <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> effect can significantly influence the structural behaviour. The changes due to this effect have not so far been considered in the civil engineering design guidelines. In order to investigate <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> effects, two-stage experimental tests are carried out on the mild-steel specimens. In the first stage, partial damage is made using quasi-static loading. During the second stage, the strength and ductility of the specimens are examined after 2 and 7 days ‘ageing’ at room temperature {{and the results are}} compared with the corresponding no-age samples. The microstructure of the specimens is examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To illustrate the effect of <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> on the global behaviour of steel structures, a numerical example is provided in which <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> impacts on loading capacity and deflection of a steel beam. Finally, the stress–strain relation of partially damaged mild-steel material incorporating <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> effects is expressed by calibrating the parameters of Ramberg–Osgood model. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis {{is to examine}} the effect of <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> on the tensile and {{fracture}} properties of reinforcing steels and to determine economically feasible methods of reducing <b>strain</b> <b>age</b> embrittlement in reinforcing bar contained in reinforced concrete structures. The effect of titanium and vanadium additions to normal reinforcing steels on <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> has been investigated by obtaining the resultant changes in mechanical properties. Both these transition elements have been effective in reducing <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> to a negligible level when present in sufficient quantities, while titanium also reduces the asrolled transition temperature and increases the Luder's strain. Examined in detail also is the effect of <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> on the mechanical properties of a normal reinforcing steel and a similar titanium-bearing steel after variation of plastic <b>strain,</b> <b>ageing</b> temperature and ageing time. Due to the stabilizing effect of the titanium addition, this steel exhibits superior impact properties over the normal steel when <b>strained</b> and then <b>aged</b> at or below 100 °C. When the ageing temperature is increased above 100 °C, these stabilized characteristics are gradually removed and hence the fracture properties tend to that of the normal steel. A critical study of the existing standards for bends in deformed reinforcing bar shows the necessity for modification of these standards to eliminate the possibility of brittle fracture at bends as a result of <b>strain</b> <b>age</b> embrittlement. Recommendations for these modifications are made from the determination of safe bend diameters obtained using data from field failures at bends...|$|R

The {{purpose of the}} study was to examine the Charpy-V and crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) fracture toughness behaviour of ferritic weld metals with respect to static <b>strain</b> <b>ageing.</b> The response of weld metals to <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> was established by clarifying the exact role of each element and interactions between these elements with respect to nine weld metal microstructure, <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> and fracture toughness properties. Systematic additions of titanium (in the range of 5 ppm to 450 ppm) and nitrogen (80 ppm to 260 ppm) were made to obtain various amounts of acicular ferrite and different microstructures which led to varying fracture behaviours and sensitivity to <b>strain</b> <b>ageing.</b> Artificially <b>strain</b> <b>aged</b> welds were obtained by two subsequent processes; 1) local compression (4 %) of the weld region in the plate thickness direction at room temperature and 2) ageig at 250 C for 1 / 2 h. An increasing nitrogen content in the weld metals leads to an increase in strenght and hardness and impairs the fracture toughness properties associated with an incrase of coarser microstructure and due to the dislocation pinning effect of free nitrogen which hinders their movements. The combined effect of N and <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> increased the strength and hardness but decreased ductility and fracture toughness significantly. (orig.)

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>strain</b> <b>aging</b> {{has been investigated}} in polycrystalline and single crystal NiAl alloys at temperatures between 300 and 1200 K. Static <b>strain</b> <b>aging</b> studies revealed that after annealing at 1100 K for 7200 s (i. e., 2 h) followed by furnace cooling, high purity, nitrogen-doped and titanium-doped polycrystalline alloys exhibited continuous yielding, while conventional-purity and carbon-doped alloys exhibited distinct yield points and Luders strains. Prestraining by hydrostatic pressurization removed the yield points, but they could be reintroduced by further annealing treatments. Yield points could be reintroduced more rapidly if the specimens were prestrained uniaxially rather than hydrostatically, owing to the arrangement of dislocations into cell structures during uniaxial deformation. The time dependence of the <b>strain</b> <b>aging</b> events followed at t(exp 2 / 3) relationship suggesting that the yield points observed in polycrystalline NiAl {{were the result of}} the pinning of mobile dislocations by interstitials, specifically carbon. Between 700 and 800 K, yield stress plateaus, yield stress transients upon a ten-fold increase in strain rate, work hardening peaks, and dips in the strain rate sensitivity (SRS) have been observed in conventional-purity and carbon-doped polycrystals. In single crystals, similar behavior was observed; in conventional-purity single crystals, however, the strain rate sensitivity became negative resulting in serrated yielding, whereas, the strain rate sensitivity stayed positive in high purity and in molybdenum-doped NiAl. These observations are indicative of dynamic <b>strain</b> <b>aging</b> (DSA) and are discussed in terms of conventional <b>strain</b> <b>aging</b> theories.

A yield stress anomaly corresponding to static <b>strain</b> <b>aging</b> was experimentally observed when the material was loaded in the transverse direction. At low strain rates small serrations on the stress-strain curves, typical for the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect are observed for the material loaded in the transverse and rolling directions at room temperature. The presence of a stress peak is attributed to the interaction between activated slip systems with the atoms of interstitial oxygen.
