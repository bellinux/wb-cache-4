40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to demonstrate the need, feasibility and relevance of disaggregating by income group the endogenized household sector in the Canadian Input-Output (I-O) model. Personal expenditures and revenue sources were endogenized into Agriculture Canada's I-O open model. Two models were developed, Model 1 and Model 2. Model 1 was a closed model that assumed homogeneity among households. Model 2 relaxed the homogeneity assumption. The superiority of Model 2 was empirically demonstrated by comparing the economic indicators generated by the models. The indicators of interest were industrial output, GDP at factor cost {{and the number of}} paid jobs. A sensitivity analysis investigated the impact of changes in wages and salaries and final demand on the models. Larger {{differences were found between the}} models when wages and salaries were stimulated. As hypothesized, Model 1 underestimated the contribution of the lowest wages and <b>salaries</b> <b>group</b> by 19. 9 percent and overestimated the impact of the higher wages and <b>salaries</b> <b>group</b> by 19 percent. A $ 1 million increase in the final demand for agricultural, agri-food and petrochemical products was also simulated. The largest impacts on industrial output occurred when agricultural production was shocked ($ 3. 8 million). This was followed by agri-food products ($ 3. 2 million) and petrochemical products ($ 2. 7 million). While differences in the models' estimates were minimal when changes in final demand were simulated, Model 2 generated additional information on the distribution of income. In conclusion, the results generated by the I-O model with the disaggregated household sector, Model 2, were consistent with budget data and economic theory...|$|R

There were four methods used in this study, 1) the job evaluation by Point System Method which results in the job points, 2) employees' perception towards the job evaluation by factor analysis, 3) construct a pay structure based on the compensation theories with and without job classification, 4) analyze the influence of the independent variables (job classification, job/position, working experience, and achievements) through double regression. The result of the process is then analyzed and elaborated by description method. The factor analysis shows that there are 3 factors which is the reduction of the 18 original factors.

This study investigated 23 occupational needs, their need importance ratings, and calculated need fulfillment scores as perceived by 645 members of the National University Continuing Education Association (NUCEA). The data, gathered from a survey sent to the membership, were scrutinized for differences in need importance and need fulfillment by employment level and other individual variables (sex, employment stage, age, education, race, and salary level) and institutional variables (type of institution, size of institution, Continuing Higher Education budget, service area, NUCEA region, and NUCEA membership category). Predictors of the total fulfillment score, as measured by the Occupational Needs Questionnaire, were investigated. Job characteristics which members reported would cause them to leave or retain a continuing higher education job were compared to the Herzberg listing of motivators and hygiene factors of job satisfaction. The total occupational need fulfillment scores indicated significant variance between groups by salary, employment level, number of people supervised, primary responsibility, highest educational degree, employment stage, sex, career objective, and race. All of these variables except race and career objective were significantly correlated with salary. Patterns of variation were found between occupational need importance ratings and sex, and occupational need fulfillment scores and salary. For example, females ranked the need "to have a manageable workload," higher than males, and the lowest paid <b>salary</b> <b>group</b> felt greater frustration with the need "to earn a comfortable living.

Predictions were on the variables found to be associated with average principals' salaries [...] fiscal capacity, average daily membership, the education level of citizens, per pupil expenditure, and average household income. Data from 133 school divisions for the 1994 - 95 school year were used in the analysis. Stepwise regression method was employed. Residuals were used to form three groups of school divisions: those divisions paying constantly more than their predicted average adjusted salary (12, 600 to 2716); those paying iii about their predicted average salary (2715 to- 2785); and those paying considerably less than predicted (- 2786 to- 14212). The groups were plotted on a map of Virginia to determine whether clusters of high positive, middle and, high negative residual divisions were evident. The clusters were reviewed to interpret whether contiguous divisions adjusted their salary levels to be competitive with their neighbors. Twenty-four school superintendents or personnel administrators were randomly selected from the clusters and interviewed to help identify the variables school divisions used to set salaries of principals, and how the data in this study might be used. Fifty-nine percent of the variance in average principals' salaries was explained by average daily membership, average education level, per pupil expenditure, and average household income.

In college admissions, equality of outcome can be measured directly by comparing offers of admission given to different groups of applicants; for example, there have been reports in newspapers of discrimination against Asian-Americans regarding college admissions in the United States which suggest that Asian-American applicants need higher grades and test scores to win admission to prestigious universities than other ethnic groups.|$|R

We attempted to determine the profiles of populations with high rates of CT usage, and to understand the association of disease patterns and socioeconomic status with CT-involved treatments. MethodsNational Health Insurance medical claim data from the cohort of 200, 000 samples representing 23 million insured people during 1997 - 2003 were used for analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with CT usage. ResultsAnnual growth rate in CT usage during 1997 - 2003 was 7. 35 % and average use of CT was 28. 69 per 1000 people. The diseases associated with the highest CT usage rates were neoplasm (169 per 1000 people), diseases of the circulatory system (33 per 1000 people), and congenital malformations (20 per 1000 people). Disease patterns with high annual growth rate of CT usage were morbidities originating in the perinatal period (29. 85 %), mental disorders (15. 47 %), and other disease patterns without clear symptoms and diagnosis (13. 33 %).

30|$|Question X 7402 on the SCF {{questionnaire}} {{reads as}} follows: ‘what {{kind of business}} or industry do you work in?’ This same question is also asked to the spouse/partner of the household head (question X 7412). The {{answer to the question}} is coded following the Census 2006 4 -digit industry code. However, due to privacy concerns, the FRB has collapsed all the industry codes into only six different ones for the publicly available data set. Individuals who work for the financial industry are coded together with those who work for Software Publishing, Data Processing, Employment and Business Support Services, Security Services and Report and Maintenance. Because of this, we cannot determine exactly if a household member works in the financial industry or not. For the purpose of constructing our sophisticated household variable we have decided to consider all the households working in the aforementioned industries. In order {{to get an idea of}} the distortion introduced in our sample because of this code merging, we look at the 2007 US Economic Census. There were a total of 17, 610, 220 employees combining all the sectors mentioned above, of those, 50  % were employed in the financial industry. Almost 11  % worked for Repair and Maintenance and Security Services. Since our sample of sophisticated households only includes those with a college degree we can assume there will not be many of those in our sample. Employment support services represents 30  % of the total employment, so our sample could be contaminated by those. However, we are looking at households whose wealth is above the median of the whole population, and, fortunately for us, there is an important divergence on the <b>salaries</b> of both <b>groups.</b> The average annual salary for financial industry employees was $ 76, 037, while for Employment and Business Support Services it was $ 28, 363. All in all, we can say that probably a great majority of our final sample of sophisticated households’ sample is employed in the financial services industry.|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundOn 24 December 2002, in {{compliance}} with Euratom Directive 97 / 43, the Minister of Health issued an ordinance on rules and regulations of safe application of ionising radiation for medical purposes and methods of internal control over observance of the rules and regulations. The ordinance obliges managers of institutions which apply ionising radiation for medical purposes (radiotherapy, X-ray diagnostics, nuclear medicine) to implement, maintain and develop the Quality Management System (QMS). On 25 August 2005, the Minister of Health issued an ordinance on rules and regulations of safe application of ionising radiation with reference to all types of medical exposure which overruled the ordinance of 24. 12. 2002. AimThe {{purpose of this paper}} was (i) the comparative analysis of the aforementioned ordinances in the context of three selected aspects: internal audits, external audits and the system of quality management, and (ii) the analysis of the rise in labour costs, services, depreciation and materials in 2002 – 2005, {{as a result of the}} implementation of the aforementioned legal rules and regulations. Materials and MethodsA comparative analysis of the two a fore mentioned ordinances of the Minister of Health was performed: concerning (i) external clinical audits, (ii) internal clinical audits and (iii) requirements of the quality management system. The total cost of implementation of such rules and regulations (in particular the cost of the Quality Management System) has been calculated based on an analysis of labour costs, depreciation, materials and services in 2002 – 2005. ResultsLegislative changes in the scope of safe application of ionising radiation for medical purposes enhance not only the organisation of health care institutions applying radiotherapy, but also the rise in costs of the organisations as a result of implementation of the changes, e. g. through (i) the costs of <b>salaries</b> for work <b>groups</b> or consulting companies implementing QMS, (ii) costs of external services, dosimetric audits by independent calibration laboratories, (iii) costs of QMS certification, (iv) awards and bonuses for internal auditors, (v) costs of service contracts, etc. ConclusionsThe implementation of the quality management system, modernisation of technical infrastructure, systematic controls and measurements of apparatuses and procedures, more effective work organisation, repeatability, regularity and homogeneity not only enhance the quality of medical service, but also the costs in radiotherapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{understand}} the opinions and potential effects of objective and subjective assessments of performance {{as a basis for}} performance pay for blue-collar workers. The study takes a qualitative approach to find out how and why four companies - Trelleborg Forsheda, Finnveden Powertrain, Isaberg Rapid and Parker Hannifin- work with salaries, incentive system and performance assessment the way they do. The concept of individual salary is central in this thesis, and individual salary is based on four criteria; capabilities, performance, work demand and formal competence. These can be divided in subjective or objective criteria. Individual salaries also contribute to salary divergence, which in many studies have indicated higher performance. Important to remember is that it has to exist a purpose to salary divergence and how salary is diverged in the company is related to the goals and strategy of the company. If the company chooses to have performance based salaries- which is salary divergence- another question arise; what is good performance? In organizations that have performance <b>salaries,</b> a <b>group</b> or an individual (often the middle manager) have to decide if a certain group of personnel performs good or bad. This can mainly be done in two different ways; objective performance assessment or subjective performance assessment. Objective performance assessment is based on numerical calculation of measures, which will form the basis for rewarding employees using a salary system that reward performance. Subjective performance measurements are based on judgment. Instead of relying on numerical calculations, one evaluates if the results reflect good or bad performance. For both methods it is essential that the personnel feels that the salaries are fair, and that the salary system is clear and easy to understand. Something else that is important to understand is that employer and employee have different views in what is a fair salary. Objective assessments are based on numerical calculations of measures, and one important property such measures have is that they don’t leave any room for excuses. Research indicate that performance pay has important motivation enhancing effects, but the profitability doesn’t always benefit from it. When monitoring costs are high, or product quality or long term thinking is required, hourly wages may be preferable. Tasks which are measured, will naturally be prioritized by the organization. This means that the choice of measures is very important. The amount of measures mustn’t be too high, {{and they have to be}} carefully considered. Subjective assessments are the opposite to objective ones. The advantages with subjective performance assessments are, among other things, that additional information which have surfaced during the period of measurements can be taken into consideration, errors in the measurement process can be corrected and unlucky circumstances can be dealt with. However, problems exist in unfair assessments, which are based on prejudice. Findings in this report shows that profitable companies have large differences in their salary systems. This is also supported by other research. The company Isaberg Rapid AB only uses objective criteria, focused on simplicity and group rewards. Finnveden Powertrain on the other hand, has a system focused on individuals and subjective assessments. Some conclusions could be drawn; one of the most important being that connections between the type of activities and the salary system is positive, and that salary systems have to be updated and revised continuously. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a community, especially a poor community, hinges on interventions from development workers in government and non government organisations. In the recent past, microfinance has been strongly recommended as an intervention that could assist poor people to improve {{their quality of life}} by providing small amounts of money to initiate development enterprises. The microfinance services are provided through microfinance institutions. This study was aimed at establishing the role of microfinance in the socioeconomic {{development of}} women in a community. Mpigi Town Council in Uganda was the study area. Fifty respondents were interviewed and eight of these were employees of microfinance institutions and two worked as technical staff from Mpigi District Local Government. Twelve microfinance institutions were identified as providing services to the community in Mpigi Town Council. A variety of literature on microfinance in the developed world, developing world, Africa, Uganda and Mpigi Town Council was reviewed. It was noted that the year 2005 was identified as the International Year of Micro-credit during which its significance would be highlighted. The aim of the international year of microcredit was to improve on the knowledge, access and utilization of micro-credit by poor people in the developing world. During the literature review, it was evident that the literature on the impact of microfinance on the socio-economic development of women in Mpigi Town Council was lacking. By filling this gap, this research will be a referral document for other researchers and a resource book for microfinance institutions during the implementation of their programmes. The study was carried out using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Questionnaires and interviews were used to collect the data that was presented in tables, graphs and numbers to show the role played by microfinance in the socio-economic development of women in a community. The findings of the study reveal that microfinance institutions operating in Mpigi Town Council provide services like training and skills development, insured credit facilities and savings mobilisation, banking facilities, supervision and monitoring of the clients, provision of agriculture inputs like seeds and chemicals and physical items like animals (cows, goats, pigs, sheep etc). The services are particularly provided to women <b>groups,</b> <b>salary</b> earners, and individual women and men. The repayment of the credit facilities is usually through weekly and monthly instalments. The size of the loan depends on the MFI but ranges from one hundred thousand to millions of shillings. The security usually required is group collateral in case of <b>groups,</b> <b>salary</b> in case of salary earners and any other as deemed necessary for the individual by the MFI. The study established that women who accessed the loans from MFIs were able to improve their socio-economic status through starting up and or expanding investments and enterprises, paying school fees for their children, purchase of household items like furniture, land and solar installation, building of houses, confidence building, participation in leadership roles etc. The research also found out that women face some challenges in their access and utilization of the MFI services and these include; small amounts of money disbursed, diversion of funds, high interest rates, low returns on investment, short grace periods, unfavourable repayment schedules and risk of property confiscation by the MFI. The respondents recommended that the government should intervene, especially where interest rate is concerned and centralize it or make it uniform and also monitor the operations of the MFIs so that they offer adequate services to the women. As far as the MFIs are concerned, the respondents recommended that they should lower the interest rate, empathize with their clients, monitor and supervise more vigorously, collaborate with fellow MFIs, increase grace period and enlist the support of employers in the area. For the microfinance beneficiaries, the beneficiaries recommended that they should not divert the funds but should use them for the purpose intended. Furthermore, they should not move from one MFI to another. They ought to acquire the loan when they have some investment already, study the MFI before acquiring the services and support each other as a group to ensure that there is progress in the various undertakings. The results of the research have led to the assertion and affirmation that although the benefits may vary from one beneficiary to another and from one community to another, microfinance has in various ways {{played a significant role in}} the socio-economic development of women in Mpigi Town Council. This research report will be used as a document for other researchers and a resource book for the microfinance institutions in Mpigi Town Council. Development StudiesM. A.
