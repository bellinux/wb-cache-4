5|$|Clouds {{typically}} cover 1% of Titan's disk, though outburst {{events have}} been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands {{to as much as}} 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the <b>southern</b> <b>summer</b> generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in convection. This explanation is {{complicated by the fact that}} cloud formation has been observed not only after the <b>southern</b> <b>summer</b> solstice but also during mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size. It was summer in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs Titan's motion, moved Titan's northern hemisphere into the sunlight. When the seasons switch, it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over the south pole.|$|E
5|$|The Arctic tern has a {{continuous}} worldwide circumpolar breeding distribution; {{there are no}} recognized subspecies. It {{can be found in}} coastal regions in cooler temperate parts of North America and Eurasia during the northern summer. During the <b>southern</b> <b>summer,</b> it can be found at sea, reaching the northern edge of the Antarctic ice.|$|E
5|$|It {{undertakes}} seasonal {{movements in}} response to the availability of water and food. African birds move southwards in the <b>southern</b> <b>summer</b> to breed and return north in the winter, and Asian populations are highly nomadic due to the variability of rainfall. This species has strong colonising tendencies, having expanded its range in Mexico, the US and the West Indies in recent decades. Wandering birds can turn up far beyond the normal range, sometimes staying to nest, as in Morocco, Peru and Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|This bird's closest {{relatives}} are {{a group of}} South Polar species, the South American (Sterna hirundinacea), Kerguelen (S. virgata), and Antarctic (S. vittata) terns. On the wintering grounds, the Arctic tern can be distinguished from these relatives; the six-month difference in moult is the best clue here, with Arctic terns being in winter plumage during the <b>southern</b> <b>summer.</b> The southern species also do not show darker wingtips in flight.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1787, Bounty left Deptford for Spithead, in the English Channel, {{to await}} final sailing orders. Adverse weather delayed arrival at Spithead until 4 November. Bligh {{was anxious to}} depart quickly, to reach Cape Horn {{before the end of}} the short <b>southern</b> <b>summer,</b> but the Admiralty did not accord him high {{priority}} and delayed issuing the orders for a further three weeks. When Bounty finally sailed on 28 November, the ship was trapped by contrary winds and unable to clear Spithead until 23 December. With the prospect of a passage around Cape Horn now in serious doubt, Bligh received permission from the Admiralty to take, if necessary, an alternative route to Tahiti via the Cape of Good Hope.|$|E
5|$|Because Ariel, like Uranus, orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side {{relative}} to its rotation, its northern and southern hemispheres face either directly towards or directly away from the Sun at the solstices. This means it is subject to an extreme seasonal cycle; just as Earth's poles see permanent night or daylight around the solstices, so Ariel's poles see permanent night or daylight for half a Uranian year (42 Earth years), with the Sun rising close to the zenith {{over one of the}} poles at each solstice. The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the 1986 <b>southern</b> <b>summer</b> solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was dark. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. A number of such events occurred in 2007–2008, including an occultation of Ariel by Umbriel on 19 August 2007.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{eccentricity}} of Saturn's orbit, Titan {{is about}} 12% {{closer to the}} sun during the <b>southern</b> hemisphere <b>summer,</b> making <b>southern</b> <b>summers</b> shorter but hotter than northern summers. This asymmetry may contribute to topological differences between the hemispheres - the northern hemisphere has many more hydrocarbon lakes. Titan's lakes are largely placid, with few waves or ripples; however, Cassini has found evidence of increasing turbulence during the northern hemisphere summer, suggesting that surface winds may strengthen during certain times of the Titanian year. Waves and ripples have also been seen by Cassini.|$|R

25|$|Reindeer were {{introduced}} to South Georgia in 1911 by Norwegian whalers for meat and for sport hunting. In February 2011, the authorities announced that due to the reindeer's detrimental effect on native species {{and the threat of}} their spreading to presently pristine areas, a complete cull would take place, leading to the eradication of reindeer from the island. The eradication began in 2013 with 3,500 reindeer killed. Nearly all the rest were killed in early 2014, with the last (about 50) cleared in the 2014/15 <b>southern</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The last {{communication}} with the rover was on sol 2210 (March 22, 2010) {{and there is a}} strong possibility the rover’s batteries lost so much energy at some point that the mission clock stopped. In previous winters the rover was able to park on a Sun-facing slope and keep its internal temperature above −40°C, but since the rover was stuck on flat ground it is estimated that its internal temperature dropped to −55°C. If Spirit had survived these conditions and there had been a cleaning event, there was a possibility that with the <b>southern</b> <b>summer</b> solstice in March 2011, solar energy would increase to a level that would wake up the rover.|$|E
25|$|The {{settlement}} at Grytviken {{was established}} on 16 November 1904 by the Norwegian sea captain Carl Anton Larsen, as a whaling station for his Compañía Argentina de Pesca (Argentine Fishing Company). It was phenomenally successful, with 195 whales {{taken in the}} first season alone. The whalers used {{every part of the}} animals – the blubber, meat, bones and viscera were rendered to extract the oil, and the bones and meat were turned into fertilizer and fodder. Elephant seals were also hunted for their blubber. Around 300 men worked at the station during its heyday, operating during the <b>southern</b> <b>summer</b> from October to March. A few remained over the winter to maintain the boats and factory. Every few months a transport ship would bring essential supplies to the station and take away the oil and other produce. The following year the Argentine Government established a meteorological station.|$|E

25|$|While Constance's {{father-in-law}} Frederick Barbarossa was on {{a crusade}} Henry and Constance were forced to stay in Germany and could not maintain her claim to Sicily. Emperor Frederick died in 1190 and the following year Henry and Constance were crowned Emperor and Empress. Constance then accompanied her husband {{at the head of}} a substantial imperial army to forcefully take the Sicilian throne from Tancred with the support of the loyal Pisa fleet. The northern towns of Sicily opened their gates to Henry, including the earliest Norman strongholds Capua and Aversa. Salerno, Roger II's mainland capital, sent word ahead that Henry was welcome and invited Constance to stay in her father's old palace to escape the summer heat, and take treatment from doctors for her infirm health. At Naples Henry met the first resistance of the whole campaign, and were held up well into the <b>southern</b> <b>summer</b> from May to August, by which time much of the army had succumbed to malaria and disease. As a result the imperial army was forced to withdraw from Sicily altogether. Constance remained in Salerno with a small garrison as a sign that Henry would soon return.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} Mars' ancient climate, {{and whether}} it might have created environments habitable for life, first {{we need to understand}} Mars' climate today. Each mission to Mars has made new advances in understanding its climate. Mars has seasonal variations in the abundances of water vapor, water ice clouds and hazes, and atmospheric dust. During <b>southern</b> <b>summer,</b> when Mars is closest to the Sun (at perihelion), solar heating can raise massive dust storms. Regional dust storms - ones having a 1000-kilometer scale - show surprising repeatability Mars-year to Mars-year. Once every decade or so, they grow into global-scale events. In contrast, during northern summer when Mars is furthest from the Sun (at aphelion), there is an equatorial water-ice cloud belt and very little dust in the atmosphere. Atmospheric water vapor varies in abundance seasonally, with the greatest abundances in each hemisphere's summer after the seasonal polar caps have sublimated into the atmosphere. During winter, both water and carbon dioxide frost and ices form on Mars' surface. These ices form the seasonal and residual polar caps. The seasonal caps - which form each autumn and sublimate each spring - are dominated by carbon dioxide ice. The residual caps - which persist year after year - consist mostly of water ice at the north pole and water ice with a thin veneer (a few 10's of meters thick) of carbon dioxide ice at the south pole.|$|E
