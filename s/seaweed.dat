5|$|Historically, Lihou was an {{important}} location for a commercially significant industry based around the harvesting of <b>seaweed</b> (or vraic in the local language, Guernésiais). Records suggest considerable activity {{as early as the}} beginning of the nineteenth century. The value of the <b>seaweed</b> as a fertiliser was so great that in 1815 Eleazor Le Marchant, lieutenant bailiff of Guernsey and owner of Lihou, initiated a court case to prevent islanders from drying <b>seaweed</b> on the beaches of Lihou. The case eventually led to new regulations issued in 1818 by the Bailiwick legislature, known as the Chief Pleas at the time, based on a review of ancient royal decrees. However, the Royal Court of Guernsey ruled in favour of the islanders in 1821, with the effect that permission to harvest <b>seaweed</b> on Lihou was granted to inhabitants of the parishes of St Peters and St Saviours. More than a century later, in 1927, a factory was established on the island to produce iodine from the <b>seaweed.</b>|$|E

The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried {{to prove that the}} substance was iodine monochloride (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the Latin word muria for brine.|$|E

40|$|Coral reefs are in {{dramatic}} global decline, with <b>seaweeds</b> commonly replacing corals. It is unclear, however, whether <b>seaweeds</b> harm corals directly or colonize opportunistically following their decline and then suppress coral recruitment. In the Caribbean and tropical Pacific, we show that, when protected from herbivores, ~ 40 to 70 % of common <b>seaweeds</b> cause bleaching {{and death of}} coral tissue when in direct contact. For <b>seaweeds</b> that harmed coral tissues, their lipid-soluble extracts also produced rapid bleaching. Coral bleaching and mortality was limited to areas of direct contact with <b>seaweeds</b> or their extracts. These patterns suggest that allelopathic seaweed-coral interactions can be important on reefs lacking herbivore control of <b>seaweeds,</b> and that these interactions involve lipid-soluble metabolites transferred via direct contact. <b>Seaweeds</b> were rapidly consumed when placed on a Pacific reef protected from fishing but were left intact or consumed at slower rates on an adjacent fished reef, indicating that herbivory will suppress <b>seaweeds</b> and lower frequency of allelopathic damage to corals if reefs retain intact food webs. With continued removal of herbivores from coral reefs, <b>seaweeds</b> are becoming more common. This occurrence will lead to increasing frequency of seaweed-coral contacts, increasing allelopathic suppression of remaining corals, and continuing decline of reef corals...|$|R

5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from <b>seaweed</b> collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, <b>seaweed</b> was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|E
5|$|In the Caribbean and {{tropical}} Pacific, direct contact between ~40–70% of common seaweeds and coral causes bleaching and {{death to the}} coral via transfer of lipid-soluble metabolites. <b>Seaweed</b> and algae proliferate given adequate nutrients and limited grazing by herbivores such as parrotfish.|$|E
5|$|On the {{submarine}} {{portion of the}} island, many marine species are found. Starfish are abundant, as are sea urchins and limpets.

50|$|Rocky {{intertidal}} habitat provides firm anchorage for <b>seaweeds,</b> barnacles, and ribbed mussels. Each winter, much of {{the standing}} crop of <b>seaweeds</b> becomes entrapped in ice.

40|$|The <b>seaweeds</b> {{form one}} of the {{important}} marine living resources. They are primitive type of plants growing in the intertidal or sub-tidal regions of the sea. They flourish wherever rocky or coral substratum is available for their attachment {{with the help of the}} rhlzoids or holdfast. Some of the <b>seaweeds</b> grow in the estuary es and backwaters too. Depending upon the type of pigment present and the other morphological and anatomical structures, the <b>seaweeds</b> are broadly grouped into green, brown, red and bluegreen algae. <b>Seaweeds</b> are used as human food, live stock feed and fertilizer for land crops in many countries. Phycocolloids such as agar-agar and carrageenan are obtained from red <b>seaweeds.</b> Algin (Sodium alginate), mannitol and iodine are extracted from brown <b>seaweeds.</b> These phytochemicals are used in food, confectionary, pharmaceutical, dairy, textile, paper, paint and varnish industries as gelling, stabilizing and thickening agents. the <b>seaweeds</b> are now used mostly as raw materials for the production of agar-agar and sodium alginat...|$|R
50|$|<b>Seaweeds</b> can be {{classified}} into three broad groups based on pigmentation: brown, red and green. These broad groups are the Phaeophyceae, Rhodophyceae and Chlorophyceae, respectively. Brown <b>seaweeds</b> are usually large, and range from the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera that is often 20 m long, to thick, leather-like <b>seaweeds</b> from 2-4 m long, to smaller species 30-60 cm long. None of the usual <b>seaweeds</b> for alginate production are cultivated. They cannot be grown by vegetative means, but must go through a reproductive cycle involving an alternation of generations. This makes cultivated brown <b>seaweeds</b> too expensive {{when compared to the}} costs of harvesting and transporting wild <b>seaweeds.</b> The only exception is for Laminaria japonica, which is cultivated in China for food but the surplus material is diverted to the alginate industry in China.|$|R
5|$|Sea anemones {{are found}} in both deep oceans and shallow coastal waters worldwide.

5|$|The North Ronaldsay sheep is {{an unusual}} breed of domesticated animal, {{subsisting}} largely on a diet of <b>seaweed,</b> since they are confined to the foreshore {{for most of the}} year to conserve the limited grazing inland.

5|$|In 1811, {{when the}} Parisian saltpetre {{manufacturer}} Bernard Courtois made iodine {{for the first}} time from the kelp ash, his discovery was greeted with great interest by experts. Accum was among the first chemists in England to undertake experiments to isolate iodine. In two articles published in Tilloch's Philosophical Journal in January and February 1814, Accum described the iodine content of different kinds of <b>seaweed</b> and gave a detailed account of a process for iodine production.|$|E

40|$|<b>Seaweeds</b> are {{the main}} source of sulfated polysaccharides within vegetables. Sulfated heteropolysaccharides such as ulvans can be found in green <b>seaweeds</b> (Chlorophyta), while other sulfated polysaccharides such as fucans are present in brown <b>seaweeds</b> (Heterokontophyta, Pheophyceae) and sulfated {{galactans}} such as agar and carrageenan appear in red <b>seaweeds</b> (Rhodophyta). Research interest in several nonsulfated polysaccharides from brown <b>seaweeds,</b> such as alginate and laminaran, is increasing. Sulfated and nonsulfated polysaccharides play structural and storage roles in <b>seaweeds</b> and may exhibit many useful biological properties. Relevant pharmacological and medical properties of algal sulfated polysaccharides, such as anticoagulant, antioxidant, antiviral, antitumoral, and immunomodulary activities, have been reported both in vitro and in animal models. Other, less well known biological properties have also been described for algal polysaccharides, including an effect on lipid metabolism and glucose concentration and antiinflammatory, antiproliferative, antimicrobial, liver-protecting, and prebiotic effects. The addition of edible <b>seaweeds</b> or seaweed-derived ingredients to traditional foods can be considered a good strategy for increasing the value of the functional foods market.
