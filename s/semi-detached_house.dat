5|$|On 15 September 1939, Mimi finally married Smith. They {{bought a}} <b>semi-detached</b> <b>house</b> called Mendips (named after {{the range of}} hills) at 251 Menlove Avenue (across {{the road from the}} Allerton Park golf course) in a middle-class area of Liverpool. After World War II started the British Government took over the Smith family's {{farmland}} for war work, and they had to find other sources of income.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Bessie and Jack {{moved to}} what would be their home for the {{remainder}} of their lives, a suburban <b>semi-detached</b> <b>house</b> in ZigZag Road, in Liverpool's West Derby district. They remained active members of Liverpool council, and in 1943 Jack became deputy leader of the Labour group. Two years later the Braddocks healed the rift with Hogan by proposing and seconding his appointment as the city's Lord Mayor for the year 1945–46; Jack succeeded him as leader of the Labour group on the council, a post he held until his death in 1963. Bessie became honorary president of the Liverpool Trades Council and Labour Party (LTCLP), the body that had been formed in 1921 when the Liverpool Trades Council merged with the newly formed local Labour Party to form a united labour front.|$|E
5|$|Mimi and Smith {{were finally}} married on 15 September 1939. They bought a <b>semi-detached</b> <b>house</b> called Mendips—named after {{the range of}} hills—at 251 Menlove Avenue, in a middle class area of Liverpool. Menlove Avenue {{suffered}} extensive damage during World War II, {{and she said that}} she often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary bombs that fell in the garden. During the war the government took over the Smiths' farmland for war work, and Smith was called up for service, but was discharged three years later, working in an aircraft factory in Speke {{until the end of the}} war. Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led Mimi to complain later that he was a compulsive gambler, and had lost most of their money.|$|E

5|$|Being {{a part of}} Best's family meant Mona was accorded respect on Merseyside, which {{included}} meeting well-known sports personalities {{of the time and}} receiving preferential treatment when booking a table in a restaurant, or a seat in the theatre. The Bests lived for a short time at the Best family's large home in West Derby, which was called Ellerslie, but Mona fell out with John Best's sister, Edna, who resented her brother's choice of wife. The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool (above Ma Edgerton's public house) but Mona was always looking for a large house—as she had been used to in India—instead of a smaller <b>semi-detached</b> <b>house,</b> which were prevalent in the area. After moving to a three-bedroom house in Princess Drive, Mona persuaded her parents, Thomas and Mary Shaw, to leave India and live with them in Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell’s father (also named Colin) {{came from}} an Argyllshire fishing family. Mitchell (Snr) worked in a solicitor's office and for the MacBrayne ferry company before serving in the 10th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in World War I. Mitchell (Snr) {{achieved}} the rank of captain (commissioned ‘in the field’) and was awarded the Military Cross at the Second Battle of Ypres but when the young Colin {{asked him how he}} would only say, 'Oh, shooting rabbits'. He was badly gassed in 1918. After the war, he worked in the City of London and married a Glaswegian woman (née Gilmour) whose father worked as a manager for the LMS Railway company. The couple took up residence in the South London suburb of Purley where they had two children – Colin and Henrietta. The family lived in a modest <b>semi-detached</b> <b>house</b> and Colin would attend services at the local Presbyterian Church wearing a kilt.|$|E
5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a <b>semi-detached</b> <b>house</b> which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E

25|$|The Report also legislated on the required, minimum {{standards}} necessary for further suburban construction; this included regulation on the maximum housing density and their arrangement and it even made recommendations on the ideal number of bedrooms and other rooms per house. Although the <b>semi-detached</b> <b>house</b> was first {{designed by the}} Shaws (a father and son architectural partnership) in the 19th century, {{it was during the}} suburban housing boom of the interwar period that the design first proliferated as a suburban icon, being preferred by middle class home owners to the smaller terraced houses. The design of many of these houses, highly characteristic of the era, was heavily influenced by the Art Deco movement, taking influence from Tudor Revival, chalet style, and even ship design.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2001 Census, the {{population}} of the Dulwich census area (which includes adjoining Rose Park) is 2,663 people, with a very slight decrease in population between the 1996 and 2001 censuses. 52.4% of {{the population}} is female, 79.4% are Australian born (see chart for a breakdown of foreign-born) and 92.5% of residents are Australian citizens. Religious adherence in Dulwich is lower than the Burnside and Adelaide average, standing at 64.3%. The eight strongest religions in decreasing order are; Catholic, Anglican, Uniting Church, Orthodox, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Buddhism and Hinduism. The most common type of dwelling was a Separate House (64.4%) followed by a flat, apartment or other (24.9%) and a <b>semi-detached</b> <b>house</b> (9.6%). Dulwich has a highly educated population with 44.5% holding a diploma or higher degree. This educational attainment is reflected in household income - almost two thirds earn over A$1000 per week.|$|E

One of her arguments was that she had a legitimate expectation that her proposal would be approved on the basis of the old guidelines; in other words, she sought fulfilment of a substantive legitimate expectation. In the end, the High Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her. She could neither show that any person with actual or ostensible authority had made any promise to her, nor that the URA's officers had acted in a way to lead her to have a legitimate expectation that her redevelopment plans would be approved. Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong has cautioned against reading the case as an implicit acknowledgement that legitimate expectations can be substantively enforced. He noted that [...] "there is good reason for judges in Singapore to tread carefully, stepping gingerly on each stone in crossing the river".|$|E

The Best family claim that Mona then pawned all her jewellery and placed a bet on Never Say Die, a horse that was ridden by Lester Piggott in the 1954 Epsom Derby; it won at 33–1 and she used her winnings to buy the house in 1957. The house had previously been owned by the West Derby Conservative Club and was unlike many other family houses in Liverpool as the house (built around 1860) was set back from the road, had 15 bedrooms and an acre of land. All the rooms were painted dark green or brown and the garden was totally overgrown. Mona later opened The Casbah Coffee Club in its large cellar. The idea for the club first came from Best, as he asked his mother for somewhere his friends could meet and listen to the popular music of the day.|$|E
