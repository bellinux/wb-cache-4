25|$|Lee did get one wicket, though, and Australia {{could have}} been forgiven for {{thinking}} {{it was the most}} important. Pietersen pulled to Simon Katich for 71, off just 76 balls, and with the score on 342 for 7, England would have to get <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary</b> out of the tail to get past 400. But they did – Steve Harmison smacked two fours and a six in an entertaining, if brief, 17, and Simon Jones stuck around with Matthew Hoggard for a vital last-wicket partnership of 32, Jones making 19 not out. Shane Warne finally got the better of Hoggard, but England had made 407, in just under 80 overs. The Australian openers took to the field for the last half-hour of the day. However, heavy rain prevented another ball being bowled on the first day.|$|E

25|$|Although Athey and Alarcon {{focus on}} the greatness of Imoinda’s character, they also {{illustrate}} {{the importance of the}} narrator as a white woman. Because the novel is mediated by a white woman and Imoinda is portrayed as having European features, the text “uses slavery, rape, and dismemberment to foreground an economic competition for the black female body and to outline an implicit competition between black, white, and indigenous females”. The authors believe that the narrator attempts to illustrate competition between the women in the novel and the significant role that Imoinda plays throughout the novel. Similarly to Athey and Alarcon, Margaret W. Ferguson illustrates the competition amongst females in the novel. In Juggling the Categories of Race, Class and Gender: Aphra Behn’s Oroonoko, Ferguson states that Behn creates “a textual staging of the implicit competition between the white English female author and the black African female slave-wife-mother-to-be”. Ferguson explains that the competition between the narrator and Imoinda arises out of the desire for Oroonoko’s body and its ability to produce <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary.</b>|$|E
500|$|Billie Piper's casting as Rose Tyler was {{announced}} in May 2004. According to executive producer Julie Gardner, former pop star Piper [...] "fits the bill perfectly" [...] as a [...] "unique, dynamic partner for Christopher Eccleston". Davies described Rose as [...] "the ordinary person who stumbles into <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary</b> and finds herself their equal." [...] Camille Coduri and Noel Clarke were also cast to play Rose's mother and boyfriend respectively; Davies wanted to include these characters to [...] "make her real" [...] and to [...] "give her a life". Rose's family is also working-class, which had rarely been seen in companions on the show prior to [...] "Rose".|$|E
500|$|The town of Banagher is {{most likely}} {{the source of a}} phrase that is widely known in many English {{speaking}} countries in the world. [...] "That beats Banagher!" [...] is a common reaction to <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary</b> or to describe something that surpasses everything. The most commonly proposed explanation is that Banagher was entitled to send two members to Parliament following its charter of incorporation in 1628. It was known as an infamous pocket borough where the members were representative of the landed class, or indeed nominated by the local lord, without a vote taking place at all. When {{a member of the house}} spoke of a family (or rotten) borough, it was not unusual for someone to reply [...] "Well, that beats Banagher!" ...|$|E

At the age of 14, she began wearing {{her hair in a}} bob. She developed an interest in fashion as a regular viewer of Cathy McGowan on Ready Steady Go!, and from the issues of Seventeen which her grandmother sent from the United States. [...] "Growing up in London in the '60s, you'd have to have had Irving Penn's sack over your head not to know <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary</b> was happening in fashion," [...] she recalled.

The sex trade is facilitated by a large, influential organization. When she tries to report her findings to the UN and local officials, she receives threats and is [...] "shunned by coworkers and thwarted by higher-ups".

[...] Their concert schedule in North America doubled, seemingly overnight; they began performing up to 520 shows per year all over the world. [...] They also began to produce other stage shows in places The Wiggles themselves were unable to visit, in Australia, the UK, and US, that featured their characters, a host, and a few dancers.

500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly {{review of the}} album, critic David Browne wrote: [...] "Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (...You were an island / And I passed you by in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "When the shimmering, pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album's weakest moment, you know you've got <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary.</b> Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar and Chris Martin’s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn't amount to much, but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, [...] "Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me," [...] he totally sells it, and you buy it.

500|$|In contrast, the {{narrative}} surrounding Fox has been critiqued as illustrating the media's focus on stereotyped portrayals {{of the heroic}} and extraordinary achievements of people with disabilities, rather than more mundane accomplishments. Actor Alan Toy noted [...] "Sure, it raised money for cancer research and sure it showed the human capacity for achievement. But a lot of disabled people are made to feel like failures if they haven't done <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary.</b> They may be bankers or factory workers– proof enough of their usefulness to society. Do {{we have to be}} 'supercrips' in order to be valid? And if we're not super, are we invalid?" [...] The media's idealization of Fox has also been critiqued for emphasizing an individualistic approach to illness and disability, in which the body is a machine to be mastered, rather than the social model of disability, where societal attitudes and barriers to inclusion play a prominent role in determining who is disabled.|$|E
500|$|The stage used {{multimedia}} projection {{and technology}} conceived by Moment Factory and Cirque du Soleil. After Madonna's entrance, {{the ground and}} stage floor revealed animated Vogue magazine covers featuring the singer. The effect was achieved by projection mapping, which turns an object (often irregularly-shaped) into a surface for video projection. Although projection mapping {{had been used to}} introduce the Nokia Lumia and project images of NBA players on the Hudson River in 2011, it had never been used on such a large scale. Moment Factory partner and executive producer Eric Fournier said that since the studio had been associated with technology-dependent shows, preparing for and accommodating the requirements of the Super Bowl were easy. When Moment Factory began the halftime-show preparations, Madonna's team had already selected the songs, and the studio developed visual effects complementing the songs' choreography. According to Moment Factory creative director Sakchin Bessette, using video projections was the most efficient method for the visual effects, as this required moving less equipment to the field than other methods. Fournier said, [...] "It all came from the decision at the beginning to make a show out of it, not just a performance. Madonna's a perfectionist, and she wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary,</b> so that was the objective of everybody." ...|$|E

500|$|Brownlee {{became the}} province's chief {{negotiator}} on resource questions in October 1921. [...] Though early attempts at reaching agreement were {{hampered by the}} unwillingness of the Maritime provinces {{to agree to the}} necessary constitutional amendments unless their own annual subsidies were increased, negotiations between the provincial and federal government continued intermittently throughout the 1920s. [...] Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King occasionally appeared receptive to Alberta's demands, but never fully agreed to them. A possible explanation for this is found in a 1924 letter from Alberta Liberal Party leader John R. Boyle to King, explaining that the UFA was likely to lose the next provincial election to Boyle's Liberals [...] "unless <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary</b> happens. That extraordinary thing which Greenfield wants to happen now is obtaining from you the natural resources at once." [...] Despite this letter, the sides seemed close to agreement in early 1925: at a January conference Alberta accepted in principle a federal offer of three years of continuing subsidy after the transfer of resource rights. [...] After an exhaustive series of meetings between Brownlee and the federal counsel, the agreement went back to the governments for approval. [...] As Greenfield and Brownlee expressed their impatience with federal inaction, an intergovernmental meeting was convened in May. The meeting proceeded at a leisurely pace into June, after which King announced that his cabinet would like the summer to consider the agreement in greater detail. The Albertans returned home in disgust.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Nolan {{directed}} his {{third and final}} Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises. Although he was initially hesitant about returning to the series, he agreed to come back after developing a story with his brother and David S. Goyer which he felt would end the series on a high note. The Dark Knight Rises was released on 20 July 2012 to positive reviews; Andrew O'Hehir of Salon called it [...] "arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen", further describing the work as [...] "auteurist spectacle on a scale never before possible and never before attempted". Christy Lemire of The Associated Press wrote in her review that Nolan concluded his trilogy in a [...] "typically spectacular, ambitious fashion", but disliked the [...] "overloaded" [...] story and excessive grimness; [...] "This is the problem when you're an exceptional, visionary filmmaker. When you give people <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary,</b> they expect it every time. Anything short of that feels like a letdown." [...] Like its predecessor it performed well at the box office, becoming the thirteenth film {{in the world to}} gross over $1-billion. During a midnight showing of the film at the Century 16 cinema in Aurora, Colorado, a gunman opened fire inside the theater, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others. Nolan released a statement to the press expressing his condolences for the victims of what he described as a senseless tragedy.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Górecki {{learned of}} an {{inscription}} scrawled {{on the wall}} of a cell in a German Gestapo prison in the town of Zakopane, which lies {{at the foot of the}} Tatra mountains in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna, a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read O Mamo, nie placz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie (Oh Mamma do not cry, no. [...] Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always). The composer recalled, [...] "I have to admit that I have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words". He later explained, [...] "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary.</b> And it really fascinated me." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 25, 1983, Jackson {{reunited with}} his {{brothers}} for a performance taped at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium for , an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an estimated audience of , and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. It is best remembered for Jackson's solo performance of [...] "Billie Jean", which earned Jackson his first Emmy nomination. Wearing a distinctive black-sequined jacket and a golf glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his signature dance move, the moonwalk, which former Soul Train dancer and Shalamar member Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to perform at the show, believing {{he had been doing}} too much television at the time; at the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy, he agreed to perform in exchange for time to do a solo performance. According to Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore, [...] "There are times when you know you are hearing or seeing <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary</b> ... that came that night." [...] Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley's and the Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times wrote in 1988: [...] "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing." [...] Gordy said of the performance: [...] "From the first beat of 'Billie Jean', I was mesmerized, and when he did his iconic moonwalk, I was shocked, it was magic, Michael Jackson went into orbit, and never came down." ...|$|E
500|$|Rose {{is used by}} Davies as an {{introduction}} to the shows mythos and fantasy elements. He later underlined similarities between Rose and Gwen Cooper—the leading lady he created for Torchwood— describing both as [...] "the ordinary person who stumbles into <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary</b> and finds herself their equal." [...] Like her successor Martha, Rose is from London; Brett Mills from the University of East Anglia makes the assumption that this is because characters from the capital of the country are [...] "relatable to all British people" [...] because they are seen as [...] "neutral". Rose is introduced alongside a supporting cast in the form of her boyfriend Mickey and mother Jackie which James Chapman cites as [...] "evidence of Davies' attempt to create a social context for the companion". Davies states that the inclusion of these two characters was part of his desire to [...] "make her real" [...] and to [...] "give her a life". He later stated that in giving Rose a mother, a boyfriend and a [...] "sad story with her father" [...] the character has [...] "her own mythology, to match the Doctor." [...] Lindy A. Orthia observes that Rose, like the other companions in Davies' era of Doctor Who, is [...] "drawn from a cosmopolitan vision" [...] in her case because of her class background. Orthia contends that whilst working-class companions had featured previously in the show [...] "none were unskilled workers nor chronically under- or unemployed like Rose, Jackie and Donna". Looking back at the two characters, Davies felt Jackie to be someone who is [...] "holding Rose back" [...] right from the first episode due to her suggestions her daughter be content with menial employment. Piper states that this causes Rose to resent her mum somewhat, although she loves her.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} series of Torchwood, Gwen functioned as an {{audience}} surrogate. Russell T Davies likened her character type {{to that of}} 2005–06 Doctor Who lead female Rose Tyler (Billie Piper): [...] "She is the ordinary person who stumbles into <b>something</b> <b>extraordinary</b> and finds herself their equal." [...] Eve Myles characterised Gwen as an ambitious and feisty young woman, who {{at the same time}} embodies many aspects of the girl next door archetype. [...] Her distinct role within the team {{stems from the fact that}} [...] "she's there for the people", who she feels [...] "instinctive and passionate" [...] about. Producer Richard Stokes noted that Gwen possesses more [...] "human empathy" [...] than the more mercenary members of the team, who are seen to be [...] "technology-and-alien-obsessed". In this vein, lead actor John Barrowman commented that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack. Describing the ways in which Gwen's methods differ from the rest of the team, Myles explained how her police procedural training relates to the job: [...] "she deals with the families, she deals with profiling, she deals with searching people's backgrounds. It's a new way of working she brings in". Myles stated that Gwen would have made a [...] "fantastic policewoman" [...] prior to joining Torchwood, drawing on the character's ability to get vulnerable characters to [...] "open up by making them feel comfortable". Myles perceived Gwen to be [...] "the heart and emotion of Torchwood", and [...] "Torchwood's social worker" [...] who can [...] "run and fight and stand in her own corner and win". Gaining insight into Torchwood through curiosity, Gwen becomes part of Torchwood because they need her, just as she needs them. Gwen's friendship with former colleague Andy is used by the production team to juxtapose her extraordinary life with a mundane one, as well as highlighting her transformation into a harder woman. Andy is present immediately before Gwen first encounters Torchwood, and Myles feels his later appearances [...] "takes you right back to the beginning, it reminds you where she came from, how Jack found Gwen". Myles observed that Gwen's many facets prevent her from getting bored; she feels constantly challenged [...] "physically", [...] "mentally" [...] and [...] "morally" [...] through portraying the character.|$|E
