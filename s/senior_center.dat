5|$|He {{was elected}} as chief {{executive}} officer of Dekalb County, Georgia in 2000, winning 64% of the vote, and was re-elected in 2004 with 54% of the vote. Jones is the first African American to serve as CEO of the county, and the youngest ever elected in the county. In April 2001, shortly after Jones became CEO, he voted, along with five other DeKalb County Commissioners, to offer life and health insurance benefits to the domestic partners of gay and unmarried County employees. DeKalb was the first county in Georgia to offer such benefits. During his administration, Dekalb County established the first local Homeland Security Office in 2001. Under Jones, DeKalb County approved creation of a new <b>senior</b> <b>center,</b> increased funding for roads, libraries, and park improvements while maintaining a balanced budget, and increasing the County's credit rating to AAA. As CEO, Jones promoted and achieved passage of a $125 million bond referendum that allowed for the acquisition of 2,735 acre expansion of the DeKalb County's green space, increasing the county's parks and green space by 70%. He requested and received Congressional designation of Arabia Mountain as a National Heritage Area. Jones was also primarily responsible for creation of Dekalb County’s first economic development department, which generated $4 billion in new investments.|$|E

40|$|<b>Senior</b> <b>centers</b> {{are ideal}} {{locations}} to deliver evidence-based health promotion {{programs to the}} rapidly growing population of older Americans to help them remain healthy and independent in the community. However, little reported research is conducted in partnership with senior centers; thus, not much is known about barriers and facilitators for <b>senior</b> <b>centers</b> serving as research sites. To fill this gap and potentially accelerate research within <b>senior</b> <b>centers</b> to enhance translation of evidence-based interventions into practice, the present study examined barriers and facilitators of <b>senior</b> <b>centers</b> {{invited to participate in}} a cluster-randomized controlled trial. Primary barriers to participation related to staffing and perceived inability to recruit older adult participants meeting research criteria. The primary facilitator was a desire to offer programs that were of interest and beneficial to <b>seniors.</b> <b>Senior</b> <b>centers</b> are interested in participating in research that provides benefit to older adults but may need assistance from researchers to overcome participation barriers.

40|$|As {{the baby}} boomer {{generation}} reaches elderly status, healthcare expenditures in the United States continue to rise. Contributing to healthcare costs {{is the high}} prevalence of chronic diseases caused by unhealthy habits of Americans such as tobacco use, lack of physical activity, and consumption of a poor diet. Many chronic diseases can be prevented by engaging in healthier behaviors. Communities and organizations can shift social norms and affect behaviors through policy intervention and environmental strategies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe policies and environments that foster healthy lifestyles in select <b>senior</b> <b>centers</b> in Montgomery County, Ohio. Specifically, this study highlights tobacco, physical activity, and nutrition policies and environmental strategies among Montgomery County <b>senior</b> <b>centers.</b> Key informant interviews were conducted at <b>senior</b> <b>centers</b> using the CHANGE tool, a resource from the CDC’s Healthy Communities Program. Many policies and environmental strategies in place among Montgomery County <b>senior</b> <b>centers</b> are a result of regulations from a higher level such as state laws, local ordinances, and city parks and recreation departments. Other key findings include an emphasis on tobacco policies and environmental strategies. Research using the CDC CHANGE methodology has not previously been conducted before in Montgomery County <b>senior</b> <b>centers,</b> therefore the information collected from this study serves as baseline information. The CDC recommends that CHANGE research be conducted annually to address incremental change and track progress over time. Recommendations for future research include using CHANGE tool to compare senior centers’ strengths and weaknesses over time...|$|R
