This process involved pulling two tabs from the camera, the second which pulled the film sandwich through the rollers to develop {{out of the}} camera. The instant color process is much more complex, involving a negative which contains three layers of emulsion sensitive to blue, green, and red. Underneath each layer are dye developing molecules in their complementary colors of yellow, magenta, and cyan. When light strikes an emulsion layer, it blocks the complementary dye below it. For instance, when blue strikes the blue <b>sensitive</b> <b>emulsion</b> layer, it blocks the yellow dye, but allows the magenta and cyan dyes to transfer to the positive, which combine to create blue. When green and red (yellow) strikes their respective layers, it blocks the complementary dyes of magenta and cyan below them, allowing only yellow dye to transfer to the positive.|$|E

The physical mechanisms underlying the ultrasound-triggered nucleation and subsequent vaporization of these phase-change emulsions are largely unexplored. Here, the acoustic vaporization of individual micron-sized perfluoropentane (PFP) droplets is studied at a nanoseconds timescale. Highly diluted emulsions of PFP-in-water and oil-in-PFP-in-water droplets, ranging from 3. 5 to 11 [*]μm in radius, were prepared and the nucleation and growth of the vapor bubbles was imaged at frame rates of up to 20 Mfps. The droplet vaporization dynamics was observed to have three distinct regimes: (1) prior to nucleation, a regime of droplet deformation and oscillatory translations within the surrounding fluid along the propagation direction of the applied ultrasound; (2) a regime characterized by {{the rapid growth of}} a vapor bubble enhanced by ultrasound-driven rectified heat transfer; and (3) a final phase characterized by a relatively slow expansion, after ultrasound stops, that is fully dominated by heat transfer.

The test procedure involved experimenting with a number of variables including photosensitive materials, coating thickness and wash-out procedures.

40|$|Acoustically <b>sensitive</b> <b>emulsion</b> {{droplets}} {{composed of}} a liquid perfluorocarbon {{have the potential to}} be a highly efficient system for local drug delivery, embolotherapy, or for tumor imaging. The physical mechanisms underlying the acoustic activation of these phase-change emulsions into a bubbly dispersion, termed acoustic droplet vaporization, have not been well understood. The droplets have a very high activation threshold; its frequency dependence does not comply with homogeneous nucleation theory and localized nucleation spots have been observed. Here we show that acoustic droplet vaporization is initiated by a combination of two phenomena: highly nonlinear distortion of the acoustic wave before it hits the droplet and focusing of the distorted wave by the droplet itself. At high excitation pressures, nonlinear distortion causes significant superharmonics with wavelengths of the order of the droplet size. These superharmonics strongly contribute to the focusing effect; therefore, the proposed mechanism also explains the observed pressure thresholding effect. Our interpretation is validated with experimental data captured with an ultrahigh-speed camera on the positions of the nucleation spots, where we find excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction. Moreover, the presented mechanism explains the hitherto counterintuitive dependence of the nucleation threshold on the ultrasound frequency. The physical insight allows for the optimization of acoustic droplet vaporization for therapeutic applications, in particular with respect to the acoustic pressures required for activation, thereby minimizing the negative bioeffects associated with the use of high-intensity ultrasound...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{to twenty}} years ago the {{discovery}} of 1 or 2 Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) per year was typical from one systematic search program, Palomar Planet Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS), and the incidental discovery {{from a variety of}} other astronomical program. Sky coverage and magnitude were both limited by slower emulsions, requiring longer exposures. The 1970 's sky coverage of 15, 000 to 25, 000 sq. deg. per year led to about 1 NEA discovery every 13, 000 sq. deg. Looking at the years from 1987 through 1990, it was found that by comparing 1987 / 1988 and 1989 / 1990, the world discovery rate of NEAs went from 20 to 43.

40|$|Particle-stabilized {{emulsions}}, {{so called}} Pickering Emulsions, {{are known for}} more than a century. In such emulsions particles, mostly inorganic particles in the nm to µm range, adsorb to oil/water interfaces and stabilize emulsions by coulomb and sterical repulsion. Pickering emulsions are usually of very high stability, and a lot of energy is needed when such emulsions should be broken. Emulsions which stability depends on external stimuli have drawn much attention in recent years, as they are both of academical and industrial interest for a number of reasons. This work is about a new class of stimuli <b>sensitive</b> <b>emulsions,</b> which are stabilized by “smart” microgel particles. The particles that have been applied in this work are poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) -co-(methacrylic acid) (PNIPAM-co-MAA) microgels. Microgels are soft polymer particles which are swollen by a solvent, mostly water. Crosslinking of polymer chains restricts the swelling and avoids complete dissolution of the particle. If the solubility of the polymer in the solvent changes with temperature, the microgel made from this polymer becomes thermosensitive. In this case the thermosensitive PNIPAM is used, which turns water-insoluble above a temperature of about 32 - 34 °C. Incorporated in a microgel, PNIPAM expels the water from the interior of the microgel at that temperature and thus the microgel shrinks. The polymerized MAA adds a pH-sensitivity to the microgel. If a base is added to the microgel, charges are generated and the increasing osmotic pressure causes the microgel to swell further. These pH and T-sensitive particles are used for emulsion stabilization, creating stable emulsions at low temperature and high pH, while the emulsions can easily be broken at high temperature and low pH. A number of different techniques, like interfacial tension measurements, interfacial rheology and cryogenic scanning electron microscopy, have been applied in order to obtain a comprehensive picture about the origin of these effects. As is turned out, the basic concepts developed for Pickering Emulsions cannot be adapted for those emulsions. In fact, the mechanism of stabilization is mainly controlled by the visco-elastic properties of the interfacial microgel layer...|$|R

40|$|In three color {{photographic}} processes the cyan dye {{image is}} usually {{controlled by the}} red <b>sensitive</b> <b>emulsion,</b> the magenta dye image by the green sensitive layer, and the yellow dye image by the blue sensitive layer. Due to the proximity of these three layers in a color film interactions among the images are found to occur. It {{has been found that}} when the images are combined into a three color picture {{they do not have the}} same characteristics as they would have if they occurred separately. The density produced in each layer depends not only on the amount of exposure of that layer but also on the amount of exposure in the other layers. The amount of dye image produced in one layer is therefore influenced by the presence or absence of simultaneous development in the other layer. The specific nature of these interactions is an important characteristic of any given color photographic process and are known as interimage effects. These interactions may be studied by means of sensitometric exposures. Interimage effects have been found in both Kodak Ektachrome Film 5258 (Tungsten) and GAF 2500 (Daylight). Data was obtained by exposing each film to produce single layer exposures and an additive neutral. Plotting the characteristic curves from the data revealed an interaction taking place in each film. Due to the inability to determine the equivalent neutral densities this report can only justifiably say that an interaction is present in both films. For a more, definitive statement on the interimage effects present in each film one must determine the equivalent neutral densities...|$|E

40|$|The screen {{printing}} process has been the least understood and studied versus other imaging methods in the graphic arts industry. As equipment configurations improve and a continuous technological development and need for high quality output persists, this fascinating process becomes increasingly popular in several end-use applications. Such as in packaging, labeling, durable graphic films printing and even short run large format halftone graphics. There is a serious need for further deep scientific analysis {{of the process and}} its variables. One of the poorly investigated sides of the four color {{screen printing}} is the effect that ink placement has to the final color appearance of a halftone print. Several known factors can influence the color result of a screen printed image. Limitations inherent to screen printing allow for a smaller color gamut reproduction compared to other methods, but colors are reproduced vividly due to a uniform and high ink film thickness. The screen - equivalent to a printing plate - consists of a stretched porous fabric mounted on a carrier frame that is coated with a light <b>sensitive</b> <b>emulsion</b> (stencil) and subsequently exposed and hardened at the non image areas. The ink will flow through the screen mesh openings when pressure and hydraulic forces are applied by a squeegee blade system. The ink system can be cured or dried by various methods depending on its chemistry and composition. For the specific system investigated, UV curing units expose the wet ink film to high energy radiation for full polymerization. The different types of equipment configurations in screen printing are designed for various processing speeds, base material formats, ink systems of specific drying and curing characteristics and also for various end use applications. This study utilized a Kammann web screen printer with five color stations and UV curing capability for roll to roll one-pass multi color printing. This type of screen printing press is used for applications such as promotional labelling with high precision type and halftone reproduction. A popular film substrate is the polyolefin construction that delivers printability, water resistance, color strength and good process characteristics through roll to roll printing presses. The polyolefin material used for this study was supplied by Fasson Films and is constructed to give a consistent ink film deposit under the set parameters without any penetration, absorption or permeation of the ink system. The samples printed from the total graphics system were produced under the same conditions using in a period of a full working day the press, screens, ink systems and substrate, but only varying the order of the printed process colors yellow (Y), cyan (C) or process blue, magenta (M) or process red and black (K). The importance of ink sequence is determined by creating these prints under the same arrangement and evaluating the color result {{as it relates to the}} sequence followed. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the ink sequence to the final color appearance of fully dried /cured ink film as expressed by its hue and saturation characteristics. The ink sequence is treated as the sole variable and all other parameters remain constant. An image was designed specifically for this process containing solids, tints and an actual halftone icon. Data was collected by a densitometer and a spectrophotometer from the individual color patches. The representative sampling consists of selected prints throughout each ink sequence run and the measured mean values of all color patches are recorded, plotted, graphed and statistically analyzed. The Hexagon GATF diagram was used to show changes from run to run, densitometric data was also graphed for comparison critique and the CIE*L*a*b* color coordinates allowed mapping of the prints for comparison analysis and color difference [delta]E* study. The data is statistically analyzed and validated versus the null hypothesis using a single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe comparisons. The final visual evaluation under standard lighting conditions per ASTM standards helps to support the results and conclusion. Experience from the field supports that the ink sequence affects the final color result assuming that all other system components remain equal. This study shows that the sequences 2 ̆ 7 compared color is different and the ink sequence is a critical factor that should be analyzed further for the screen printing industry in order to help maintain color consistency and control. The hypotheses are supported by the study 2 ̆ 7 s results. The ink sequence influences the color 2 ̆ 7 s hue and saturation in four color halftone screen printing having distinct differences for every sequence that was produced during the printing run. The UV ink systems used, adhere and transfer better to the substrate instead of the ink layers. The placement of black is important for color control and trapping. If black is printed first down then the other inks trap well and a clean image is produced; if black is last, trapping is poor and consequently the color and image appearance. The target guide Nucleus Pattern Sequence Originator was ideal for color measurements and evaluation in screen printing; it is recommended for similar future research work. Densitometry and use of Hexagon diagrams is not very effective in screen printing. The use of colorimetry can show any color changes more accurately. It was also shown that the midtones are influenced the most form the change in ink sequence; especially important for trapping. Finally, two (2) of the ink sequences showed good results as concluded by the final evaluation. The MCYK delivered the best output in data and KMCY printed closest to the original proof...|$|E

In this work, we analyzed the signal generated by bubble evaporation in the frequency and time domain. We used octafluoropropane (R- 218) based <b>emulsions,</b> <b>sensitive</b> to both photons and neutrons. The frequency content of the detected pulses appears to extend well into the hundreds of kHz, beyond the range used in commercial devices to count bubbles as they are formed (typically 1 - 10 kHz). Kilohertz components characterize {{the early part of}} the waveforms, potentially containing information about the energetics of the explosive bubble initial growth phase. The power spectral density of the acoustic signal produced by neutron-induced evaporation shows a characteristic frequency pattern in the 200 - 400 kHz range, which is not observed when bubbles evaporate upon gamma ray-induced irradiation. For practical applications, detection of ultrasonic pulses associated with the boiling of the superheated drops can be exploited as a fast readout method, negligibly affected by mechanical ambient noise...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{coalescence}} or {{fusion of}} fat globules {{is a common}} form of destabilisation in food-related partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions that generally causes thickening of the emulsion, reduced functionality and phase separation. Partial coalescence is particularly exacerbated by shear, temperature fluctuations and air incorporation. Each of which the food product may be exposed to during manufacture, storage, transport or end use leading most often to deleterious effects. One notable example of partial coalescence being desirable is during the manufacture of ice cream. In order {{to better understand the}} factors affecting partial coalescence and their interactions, a systematic series of studies was undertaken on the shear stability of a model food-related partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsion. Shear-induced aggregation of 35 wt% partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions was studied under conditions causing jamming of partially coalesced fat globule aggregates formed under steady shear. Emulsions with different interfacial compositions and solid fat content (~ 25 – 90 %) were studied to probe their effect on the generation of a jamming transition over a range of shear rates (500 – 2000 s- 1). By displacing adsorbed sodium caseinate from the oil-water interface using Tween 20, partial coalescence <b>sensitive</b> <b>emulsions</b> were prepared with either mixed sodium caseinate-Tween 20 or Tween 20 dominated interfacial film compositions using 0. 5 or 1. 5 wt% Tween 20 respectively. Quiescently, the emulsions were stable with 0. 5 wt% Tween 20 regardless of solid fat content. At 1. 5 wt% or above, stability decreased with increasing solid fat content and Tween concentration. Under shear, partial displacement of adsorbed sodium caseinate by Tween 20 generally resulted in the formation of relatively stable aggregates whereas high displacement of protein {{led to the formation of}} less stable aggregates under shear. The aggregation time of emulsions with Tween 20 dominated interfaces decreased with increasing solid fat content whereas for mixed sodium caseinate-Tween 20 emulsions it increased with increasing solid fat content. The extent of fat globule aggregation at low solid fat content was relatively low irrespective of Tween concentration, whereas at high solid fat content, the extent of aggregation varied considerably when interfacial composition was altered. Cryo-TEM micrographs of the fat globules revealed a relatively smooth surface regardless of composition indicating that fat crystal protrusion was not a major factor affecting the stability. These findings showed that interfacial protein functions both to regulate the formation of partially crystalline aggregates as well as the aggregate stability under shear. Furthermore, high solid fat content emulsions although low in liquid oil content were shown to be highly susceptible to partial coalescence when the adsorbed protein load was low. The effect of polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters (Tween) alone or in combination with sorbitan fatty acid esters (SPAN) on the shear stability of partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions (35 wt% fat) was studied. Low molecular weight emulsifiers like Tweens and SPANS are often used to regulate the susceptibility of partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions to aggregation and partial coalescence. It was found that emulsion stability increased with increasing chain length of the saturated Tween emulsifiers, while unsaturated Tween 80 was comparatively much more unstable than the saturated types of Tween. The effect of 1 wt% SPAN (SPAN 20, 40, 60 and 80) in the dispersed phase of emulsions containing different concentrations of Tween 80 (0. 2 – 0. 6 wt%) was also investigated. The emulsions showed sharp stability transitions from stable to unstable over the range of Tween 80 concentrations tested. All SPAN containing emulsions with 0. 2 wt% Tween 80 were stable under shear however all emulsions with 0. 6 wt% Tween 80 immediately aggregated when shear was applied. At 0. 4 wt% Tween 80, the saturated long fatty acid chain length emulsifiers (SPAN 40 and 60) were in general much more stable compared to SPAN 20 and 80 containing emulsions. This study indicated that oil soluble SPAN emulsifiers with low and high melting points were similarly poor at preventing partial coalescence. Therefore, phase transitions were likely not a major contributing factor to emulsion stability. Finally, the effects of Tween 20, 40, 60 and 80 on the stability of partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions prepared with and without 1 wt% sodium caseinate were studied. Generally, 1 wt% sodium caseinate emulsions with the unsaturated emulsifier Tween 80 were the most unstable followed by the saturated emulsifiers Tween 20, 40 and 60 in order of increasing fatty acid chain length. Long chain saturated Tween emulsifiers (Tween 40 and 60) improved emulsion stability regardless of whether sodium caseinate was present indicating that alone these emulsifiers form more robust interfacial films compared to the shorter chain length Tween 20 and the unsaturated Tween 80. The Tween type dependent effect on supercooling and fat crystallization caused by interfacial heterogeneous nucleation was also studied using pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance. With sodium caseinate, the degree of supercooling decreased and the crystallization rate diminished with increasing saturated fatty acid chain length but only negligible changes were found without sodium caseinate. These findings indicate that long chain saturated Tweens improve emulsion stability by forming robust interfaces but with sodium caseinate also improve stability through interfacial heterogeneous nucleation. These novel findings provide guidance on how combinations of proteins and emulsifiers can be used to modify and control the stability of partially crystalline oil-inwater emulsions through their combined effects on fat crystallization and interfacial film properties...|$|R
5000|$|The {{developer}} selectively reduces {{silver halide}} crystals in the emulsion to metallic silver, but only those having latent image centres created by action of light. The light <b>sensitive</b> layer or <b>emulsion</b> consists of silver halide crystals in a gelatin base. Two photons of light must be absorbed by one silver halide crystal {{to form a}} stable two atom silver metal crystal. The developer used generally will only reduce silver halide crystals that have an existing silver crystal. Faster exposure or lower light level films usually have larger grains because those images capture less light. Fine grain films, like Kodachrome, require more light to increase the chance that the halide crystal will absorb at least two quanta of light as they have a smaller cross sectional size. Therefore, silver halide crystal size is proportional to film speed. The metallic silver image has dark (black) appearance. Once the desired level of reduction is achieved the development process is halted by washing in a dilute acid and then the undeveloped silver halide is removed by dissolving it in a thiosulfate solution, a process called fixing. Most commercial film developers use a dual solution or [...] "push" [...] (pushes the films speed) development (compensating developer, like Diafine) procedure where the reducing agent e.g. hydroquinone solution soaks into and swells the gelatin then the film is introduced into the alkaline solution which activates (lowers reduction potential) of the developer. The areas with the most light exposure use up the tiny amount of developer in the gelatin and stop making silver crystal before the film at that point is totally opaque. The areas that received the least light continue to develop because they haven't used up their developer. There is less contrast, but time is not critical and films from several customers and different exposures will develop satisfactorily.|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary Cold Mix Asphalt (CMA) {{serves as}} a {{promising}} alternative {{for a wide range}} of paving applications from preventative maintenance and repair, to full-scale pavement construction. Compared to traditional Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) and Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA), CMA provides a number of benefits that make it a promising alternative to conventional paving technologies, including reduction in heating energy and longer working time for transportation and placing. However, the reported higher air void content and higher moisture susceptibility of CMA relative to traditional HMA present legitimate concerns that has limited more widespread use of CMA to date. To mitigate the potential for moisture damage in CMA, it is necessary to include a simple and effective method for evaluating moisture susceptibility in the material selection phase of the mix design process. The most direct way to prevent moisture sensitivity is to require a minimum threshold of aggregate coating as part of CMA mix design in regards to both extent and quality of coating. This study refines a recently developed method to quantify aggregate coating extent in CMA using Digital Image Analysis Methods and applies the procedure to several aggregate-emulsion systems to isolate factors most directly affecting aggregate coating. After identifying the most significant factors, a regression analysis of the experimental results is used to develop quantitative models to predict coating of aggregates in CMA as a function of mix design parameters. Results show that not only Image Analysis Method {{serves as a}}n effective and reliable tool in identifying aggregate coating, but also that the regression models developed to predict coating are <b>sensitive</b> to <b>emulsion</b> type, aggregate gradation and residual asphalt content. Including evaluation of coating quality is a generally accepted practice in mix design for conventional HMA, WMA, and CMA. This study introduces the concept that it is necessary to assess quality of coating as a means to ensure adequate bonding between the asphalt and aggregate to truly assess potential for moisture damage. To evaluate quality of coating, a Modified Boiling Test procedure on cured CMA loose mixture that involves application of the Image Analysis Method to quantify the coating before and after boiling was developed. Results reveal that after curing is achieved as indicated by negligible moisture loss in the mixture, the bonding between emulsion residue and aggregate continues to increases with curing time. Modified Boiling Test results on fully cured CMA loose mixture indicate that CSS- 1 hl performs much better than CSS- 1 h and CSS- 2 emulsion, showing the best coating quality. The results were also verified by Binder Bond Strength (BBS) test on emulsion residues and asphalt emulsions. The relationship between coating quality and mixture performance was verified through comparison of boiling test results to mixture moisture damage as measured by the Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR). Prior to conducting this comparison a CMA mix design method was proposed to ensure a uniform process for selection of design emulsion content and preparation of mixture samples. The proposed CMA mix design method determines the design emulsion content (DEC) based on volumetric analysis and mixture indirect tensile strength. The Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) test based on this mix design shows consistency with Modified Boiling test result and correlation between TSR test and Modified Boiling test is also established...|$|R
