40|$|Thermal {{cracking}} of railway <b>wheel</b> <b>treads</b> is investigated using {{a combined}} experimental and numerical approach. Results from controlled brake rig tests of repeated stop braking cycles for a railway wheel in rolling {{contact with a}} so-called railwheel are presented. Test conditions are then numerically analysed using finite element (FE) simulations that account for the thermomechanical loading of the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> For the studied stop braking case, thermal cracks {{are found in the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> after few brake cycles. Results from thermal imaging reveal a frictionally excited thermoelastic instability phenomenon called "banding" where the contact between brake block and wheel occurs only over a fraction of the block width. This condition results in locally high temperatures. The numerical analysis assesses ratcheting response of the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> material under operational conditions corresponding to two types of banding patterns and also a case of uniform heating. Fatigue life predictions are estimated from the evaluated ratcheting response using a simplified accumulation rule.

40|$|Abstract. Upon {{investigation}} of the damaged wheels {{it was determined that}} the cracking was caused by thermal fatigue during on-tread friction braking. The thermal cracks appear as short cracks oriented axially on the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> Severe heating of the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> during braking was believed to be a contributing the variation of residual stress which is related to wheel failure. It is necessary to evaluate the residual stress due to deterioration of <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> in order {{to ensure the safety of}} wheel. In the present paper, the residual stress of railway wheel for deterioration using x-ray diffraction system is evaluated. The result shows that the residual stress of wheel is depend on the running distance and the residual stress needs to be inspected between the wheel diameter of 800 and 780 mm...|$|R
40|$|The {{in-service}} wheel-set {{quality is}} one of critical challenges for railway safety, especially for the high-speed train.

Eddy current pulsed thermography (ECPT) is studied to compensate the Ultrasonic Testing (UT) method for detection these early stage of fatigue cracks in <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> This paper proposes several induction coils, such as linear coil, Yoke coil and Helmholtz coils, based ECPT method to meet the imaging of multiple cracks and irregular surface in <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> through numerical simulation and experimental results.

40|$|The {{wheelset}} {{maintenance cost}} {{is an important}} part of train maintenance cost. Researchers and railway operators have been closely concerned about the way to minimize residual stress at <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> and surface roughness during wheel reprofiling, thereby reducing the wheel damage during operation, extending the wheelset service life, and cutting down wheelset maintenance cost. The present study involves dynamic simulation of tread reprofiling process by building a finite element model of wheel reprofiling, taking the wheel steel as research object. This paper makes a comprehensive analysis of surface roughness and residual stress distribution of <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> under different milling parameters. The simulation results indicate that the increase in cutting speed and back cutting depth causes the chip morphology to change while impairing the machined surface quality. Once serrated chip occurs, it means <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> machining quality deteriorates remarkably. In this way, the paper associates macroscopic chip morphology with microcosmic surface roughness and internal residual stress to provide theoretical basis for optimization of wheel reprofiling process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA new {{inspection}} system for railway wheels using the Doppler Effect {{is presented in}} this work. The proposed system analyses the rail-wheel contact by frequency and phase shifts. Cracks on the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> are determined while the train moves at a low speed. A special rail is used to propagate monochromatic surface waves. When a wheel on the measuring rail moves at constant speed, the received signal will present a regular frequency shift related with the movement speed. The difference between the emitted and the received frequencies will change if any defect on the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> is detected...|$|R
50|$|If, {{however, the}} {{wheelset}} is displaced to one side, the diameters of {{the regions of}} contact, and hence the tangential velocities of the wheels at the running surfaces are different and the wheelset tends to steer back towards the centre. Also, when the train encounters an unbanked turn, the wheelset displaces laterally slightly, so that the outer <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> speeds up linearly, and the inner <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> slows down, causing the train to turn the corner. Some railway systems employ a flat wheel and track profile, relying on cant alone to reduce or eliminate flange contact.|$|R
50|$|The {{benefit of}} linked wheels {{derives from the}} {{conicity}} of the <b>wheel</b> treads—the <b>wheel</b> <b>treads</b> are not cylindrical, but conical. On idealised straight track, a wheelset would run centrally, midway between the rails.|$|R
40|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>treads</b> {{are subject}} to {{different}} types of damage such as wear, rolling contact fatigue (RCF), thermal cracks, plastic deformation and also flats caused by wheel sliding. Some of these phenomena {{is followed by a}} change in tread profile which results in frequent wheel reprofiling to keep rich comfort of the vehicle. In this study, a series of full-scale tread braking experiments, including wheel-rail rolling contact, were conducted in order to clarify the influencing factors of evolution of <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> profile. The experiments focused on plastic deformation and wear caused by rolling contact and tread braking. The presented results show that the maximum tread depression is 0. 20 mm at the rolling contact center after 40 times stop braking actions. This is considered to be caused by plastic deformation of the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> induced by high contact pressure and material softening due to high temperatures from tread braking. This result is supported by the observed protrusion of the tread near the rolling contact area and also by a difference of hardness between the rolling contact area and other tread area...|$|R
40|$|The {{method has}} been used to {{estimate}} the maximum depth in railway <b>wheel</b> <b>treads.</b> It is based on a pulse-echo-technique utilizing linearly polarized shear waves incident normally to the rear surface of the wheel rim. When the polarization direction is selected {{in such a way that}} the wave is horizontally polarized with respect to the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> surface the shear wave propagates - depending on the probe position along the wheel radius - equally grazing along the surface or into the volume of the wheel rim below the surface. When a crack-like defect is situated within the ultrasonic beam the attenuation of the backwall echo sequence increases significantly even when the defect is oriente oblique or parallel to the propagation direction of the wave. The amount of additional attenuation depends on the probe position with respect to the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> surface. Quantitative evaluation of this effect allows to estimate the maximum defects depth. The method has been studied on artificial notches an d natural cracks (maximum depth between 5 and 18 mm) in railway wheels...|$|R
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of railway wheels to {{wear and}} rolling contact fatigue damage {{is influenced by}} the properties of the wheel material (microstructure and hardness). These properties are influenced by the steel composition, wheel manufacturing process, and by the stresses experienced during operation. The in-service properties can therefore vary with depth below the surface, and with position across the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> This paper discusses the stress history at the wheel/rail contact (derived from dynamic simulations) and the variation in hardness and microstructure with depth from the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> (measured on <b>wheels</b> removed from service). The results are linked to the observed rolling contact fatigue resistance of railway wheels...|$|R
40|$|Roughness (corrugation, waviness) on {{the tread}} of a rolling railway wheel leads to {{vibrations}} in wheels, bogies and superstructure {{and also in}} rails, sleepers and roadbed. These vibrating components radiate noise to the surroundings. A lowering of the noise levels from tread braked freight cars is of utmost importance {{for the future of}} rail traffic. The thermomechanical interaction between brake block and <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> during braking has been found to cause hot spots on the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> This phenomenon is believed to be a main contributor {{to the development of a}} wavy tread surface. Due to thermal expansion of the rim material, the hot spots will protrude from the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> and be more exposed to wear during the wheel/block contact than the rest of the tread surface. The non-even wear results in roughness on the <b>tread</b> of the <b>wheel</b> after cooling. In the present paper, a theoretical and numerical model of the interaction between wheel rim and brake block has been developed. Simulations with this model demonstrate the principal phenomena occurring at the wheel/block contact. Furthermore, results from field measurements of wheel roughness are presented...|$|R
50|$|The wheel diameter(tread) reduces due {{to brake}} {{application}} as the brake blocks rub against the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> Over {{a period of}} time, the wheel diameter reduces up to 819 mm. 819mm is the condemnation diameter for the wheels. This diameter is also not sacrosanct and is changed depending upon the supply position of the wheels. The maximum variation in the wheels on the same axle is permitted up to 0.5 mm, between two wheels of the same bogie up to 5 mm and among the four wheel sets of the same coach up to 13 mm. The diameter of a new wheel is 915 mm. Hence maximum <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> wear allowed is (915 mm - 819mm) = 96 mm. In order to adjust for {{the difference in the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>tread,</b> a packing is placed under the flange of the lower spring seat. This packing ring is generally made up of NFTC(Natural Fiber Thermosetting COMPOSITE) or UHMWPE (Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) material. The thickness of the NFTC packing ring is equal to 50% of the difference between the dia of a new wheel and the wheel in question.|$|R

The main objective {{of the present study}} is to find the limits for tread braking with respect to temperature impact on rolling contact fatigue (RCF) of the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> A <b>wheel</b> with an S-shaped web is studied for some different stop braking loads. Using 3 D FE simulations, the effects of simultaneous thermal loading from braking and mechanical loading, with traversing wheel-rail rolling contact, are studied. In order to account for the elevated temperatures, the simulations utilise a temperature-dependent elastoplastic material model. The mechanical loads account for frictional rolling contact stress distributions induced by braking, using a novel method that is based on elastoplastic contact simulations. Partial slip is considered and interfacial shear stresses are introduced in the wheel-rail contact area. Evolution of damage {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> is studied for various brake loading cases. In order to assess limits for the tread braking, the calculated damage is compared to previously developed critical damage levels which were based on full-scale brake rig testing. Results are presented for a parametric study with thermomechanical loading based on different load cases. The influence from operational parameters such as axle loads, initial speeds, decelerations and block material is studied. The results show that the temperature has a strong influence on the rolling contact fatigue of the <b>wheel</b> <b>treads</b> and, hence, also on the thermal capacity of the wheels. The study gives preliminary limits for revenue traffic, described as combinations of tread temperatures and wheel-rail rolling contact loading, which should be respected to avoid thermal cracking of the <b>wheel</b> <b>treads...</b>|$|R

Among these, tread braking {{is still the most}} common system for friction braking. Tread brake systems are cheap and robust. However, extensive usage of tread brakes demands knowledge of operational limits to ensure safety and decrease life cycle costs (LCC) of the running gear. In the present work, a state-of-the-art literature survey has been compiled which covers topics related to establishing operational limits such as: brake control and blended braking, braking temperatures, brake block materials, wear and rolling contact fatigue of <b>wheels</b> due to <b>tread</b> braking, and capacity of tread brakes and brake discs. A methodology to simulate full-scale brake rig tests, including wheel-rail contact, has been further developed. It includes an axisymmetric thermal analysis, a 3 D mechanical wheel-rail contact analysis, and a 3 D thermomechanical analysis of the braked wheel. The behaviour of ER 7 grade railway wheel material is mimicked by use of a plasticity model calibrated against results from cyclic experiments on test specimens. The results from the simulations in terms of predicted fatigue lives show good agreement with full-scale test rig results for three combinations of initial velocity and brake block material.
