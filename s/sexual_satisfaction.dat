25|$|Kinsey's Sexual Behavior in the Human Female showed that, {{over the}} {{previous}} five years of sexual activity, 78% of women had orgasms in 60% to 100% of sexual encounters with other women, compared with 55% for heterosexual sex. Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's <b>sexual</b> <b>satisfaction</b> than male partners do. Like Kinsey, scholars such as Peplau, Fingerhut and Beals (2004) and Diamond (2006) found that lesbians have orgasms more often and more easily in sexual interactions than heterosexual women do, and that female partners are more likely to emphasize the emotional aspects of lovemaking. In contrast, research by Diane Holmberg and Karen L. Blair (2009), published in the Journal of Sex Research, found that women in same-sex relationships enjoyed identical sexual desire, sexual communication, <b>sexual</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> and satisfaction with orgasm as their heterosexual counterparts.|$|E

Only 46 % of men and 58 % of women were satisfied with their current frequency of sex. Dissatisfied men were overwhelmingly likely to desire sex more frequently; among dissatisfied women, only two thirds wanted sex more frequently. Age was a significant factor but only for men, with those aged 35 – 44 years tending to be least satisfied. Men and women who were dissatisfied with their frequency of sex were also more likely to express overall lower <b>sexual</b> and relationship <b>satisfaction.</b> The authors’ findings not only highlight desired frequency of sex as a major factor in satisfaction, but also reveal important gender and other sociodemographic differences that need to be taken into account by researchers and therapists seeking to understand and improve <b>sexual</b> and relationship <b>satisfaction</b> among heterosexual couples.

25|$|Primary anorgasmia is a {{condition}} where one has never experienced an orgasm. This is significantly more common in women, although it can occur in men who lack the gladipudendal (bulbocavernosus) reflex. Women with this condition can sometimes achieve a relatively low level of sexual excitement. Frustration, restlessness, and pelvic pain or a heavy pelvic sensation may occur because of vascular engorgement. On occasion, {{there may be no}} obvious reason why orgasm is unobtainable. In such cases, women report that they are unable to orgasm even if they have a caring, skilled partner, adequate time and privacy, and an absence of medical issues which would affect <b>sexual</b> <b>satisfaction.</b>|$|E
25|$|If orgasm is desired, anorgasmia may be {{attributed}} to an inability to relax. It may be associated with performance pressure and an unwillingness to pursue pleasure, as separate from the other person's satisfaction; often, women worry so much about the pleasure of their partner that they become anxious, which manifests as impatience with the delay of orgasm for them. This delay can lead to frustration of not reaching orgasmic <b>sexual</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> Psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, in his 1927 book Die Funktion des Orgasmus (published in English in 1980 as Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neurosis) was the first to make orgasm central to the concept of mental health, and defined neurosis in terms of blocks to having orgastic potency. Although orgasm dysfunction can have psychological components, physiological factors often play a role. For instance, delayed orgasm or the inability to achieve orgasm is a common side effect of many medications.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have found}} that {{men are more likely}} to engage in extramarital sex if they are {{unsatisfied}} sexually, while women are {{more likely to engage in}} extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that <b>sexual</b> <b>satisfaction</b> may be more important to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, & Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass & Wright also found that men and women who are involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.|$|E

METHODPeriod since marriage, period since ostomy, <b>sexual</b> dysfunction, and <b>satisfaction</b> with sex life in the pre / post operation periods were analyzed and evaluated by a mailed questionnaire. RESULTSex function disorders of male ostomates occurred with high probability. Male estimates and spouses were not satisfied with the preoperative explanation about sex function disorder. The degree of sex life satisfaction of male ostomates and spouses were lower in the postoperation re period than in the preoperation re period. Unlike their male partners, spouses did not require treatment for sexual dysfunction. CONCLUSIONThis study indicates that spouses were less dissatisfied with their sex lives than male ostomates postoperatively, and also that spouses did not expect practical treat went.
