50|$|The missile {{system could}} be {{deployed}} {{in a number of}} configurations. The man-portable configuration consists of a launcher which doubles up as a transport container, a combined sight and controller, a battery and a 63 meter long cable. An optional Missile <b>Selector</b> <b>Box</b> allowed up to 6 missiles to be controlled by, and widely separated from, a single sight controller. The launcher box is placed on the ground facing the direction of expected targets, and then connected by the cable to the sight controller, which can be deployed some distance away. The sight controller is a pistol grip design, with two grips. The front grip has the launch trigger, and the rear grip has a thumb joystick for steering the missile. A low-magnification (3.2x) monocular forms the sight itself. Engraved stadia lines allow simple ranging, based on a typical tank target bridging the lines once in range.|$|E
50|$|As {{development}} of a new main battle tank stalled with problems and cost escalating quickly, the M60A1 was forced to serve longer than originally intended with production lasting over 20 years. In that time span numerous product improvement programs were put forward. The first of which was TLAC, for Top Loading Air Cleaner. This reduced dirt and dust ingestion, which increased engine life. Its top loading configuration also made it easier to service. Next came the AOS meaning Add-On Stabilization that was introduced in late 1972. As its name implies, this was an add on stabilizer kit made to fit with minimum modifications to the existing hydraulic gun control system. It was made up of several components: the rate sensor package, a control <b>selector</b> <b>box,</b> the electronics package, a shut-off valve, the traverse servo-valve assembly, the elevation servo-valve assembly, the handle shaping assembly, an hydraulic filter, and an antibacklash cylinder. At short to medium ranges, hit probabilities better than 50% from a moving M60A1 were obtained in Aberdeen test results while without a stabilizer it was essentially zero. M60A1(AOS) was the designation received by M60s equipped with the TLAC, AOS and the new T142 steel track, which had replaceable rubber pads and improved service life.|$|E

40|$|Purpose/Introduction: Phased arrays improve B 1 {{homogeneity}} {{for head}} imaging up to 9. 4 T (1). Tight fit arrays further improve transmit performance (2). However, due to close proximity loading {{of the elements}} depends on the head size. Therefore, tuning and matching are necessary before each experiment. Automatic tuning/matching (3, 4) is a valid but complicated approach. In case of well decoupled arrays and moderate subject motion a multi-channel mechanical switch can be used (5) for tuning and matching. These switches, however, often contain magnetic components and are expensive. In this work we have developed a low cost electronic tuning/matching <b>selector</b> <b>box</b> using solid state integrated switches (Mini-circuits, USA) for an 8 -channel 9. 4 T (400 MHz) phased array. Subjects and Methods: A major component of the tuning/matching <b>selector</b> <b>box</b> (Fig. 1), i. e. an 8 -way absorptive switch, consists of two 4 -way absorptive switches (GSWA- 4 - 30 DR+) and a 2 -way reflective switch (SWM- 2 - 50 DR+). Control electronics in combination with a rotary channel selector allows easy and quick connection of the RF input {{to one of the}} 8 outputs of the ODU socket (Fig. 1). Figure 2 shows the final setup for array tuning/matching. All 8 array channels are combined together using an ODU connector, which is plugged into the box. An RF sweeper is connected to the RF input and can be sequentially connected to each of the array elements using the channel selector. The only magnetic component, the power supply providing + 5 V, - 5 V (Fig. 1 a), has to be placed outside of the magnet room and connected by the extension cord. Results: Using this setup the 8 -channel transceiver array can be tuned and matched within 2 min with the subject present directly at the scanner. Usually it takes less since some elements doesn’t have to be readjusted. In comparison to mechanical switches solid state switches are lossy, which does not cause any issue since their VSWRs are sufficiently good. In our case the tuning/matching box introduced - 2. 1 dB loss (from the ODU plug to the BNC RF input) with input and output VSWRs measuring 1. 2 and 1. 13, respectively. Discussion/Conclusion: As an alternative to a complicated automatic tuning/matching of multi-channel transceiver arrays we have developed a low cost 8 -channel tune/match selector, which allows quick adjustment of arrays inside the magnet room. The design allows an easy extension to a larger number of channels...|$|E
40|$|Improved the {{efficiency}} in refreshing the data grid. There {{should be a}} noticeable speed improvement when working with large data sets. Added a "maximum columns to display" option (parallel of max rows) which has reduced {{the chances of a}} major crash with wide data sets when set to 30 (the default) or below. The number of columns being displayed is now indicated at bottom of the data grid. Implemented auto recovery options. A backup of the data is saved every five minutes in idle time. The log file is backed up after running every command. The internal log (i. e. including internal R code) is backed up after running every (internal) command. When R-Instat crashes unexpectedly these files may be retrievable through a new dialog that appears when restarting after a crash. Options include opening the backup data and re-running the backup log file. A message appears when an R command has been running for more the two seconds to notify users that R-Instat is still running. An initial implementation of some climatic dialogs (start of rains, spells) is in place. Additional settings {{have been added to the}} Options dialog. Import from file dialog now only displays preview for csv and xls/xlsx files (since these are the only file types rio can import with a row limit). Some general bug fixes on this dialog and it can now import text based. DAT files (h/t Savitri Wilson) The Stack dialog can now stack multiple sets of columns. The Merge dialog is simplified (additional options are on the sub dialog) and it can now merge a subset of the columns of each data frame Simplified the design of the Open from Library dialog and added packages In general, sub dialogs open on the first tab after the main dialog has been reset Dialog specific headers for <b>selector</b> <b>box</b> e. g.

2500|$|Identification of Trains and Routing Automatically (IDENTRA) was {{implemented}} {{on the line}} in the 1957 and used until 1997, when a route <b>selector</b> punch <b>box</b> with B1 Astoria, local/express buttons was installed at the 10/11 car marker on the upper level of Queensboro Plaza. IDENTRA used a removable round circular disc type radio antenna assembly, slide-mounted on the small mounting brackets that were attached on the front of R12, R14, R15, and R17 cars that were assigned to the 7 route, which had been used on the line since 1948. Similar to the use of radio transponders in the CBTC installation, the system used the antennas to determine whether a train was running local or express, and then accordingly switched the track at interlockings near the Queensboro Plaza and Flushing–Main Street stations. This move reduced the number of signal towers on the line from 9 to 2 and allowed to operate 37 eleven-car trains instead of only 30 nine-car trains per hour. The consolidated signal system was in use by 1956 while the selector system was in service by 1958. This system, still in use by many transit agencies such as SEPTA's Broad Street Line, is also nicknamed the [...] "toilet seat" [...] because the removable disc antenna is shaped like a toilet seat.|$|R
