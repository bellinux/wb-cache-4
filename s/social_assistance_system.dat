40|$|The {{transitional}} {{economies of}} the Former Soviet Union (FSU) have enjoyed an extraordinary period of growth and poverty reduction between 2000 and 2007 and this occurred in concomitance with significant increases in private and public transfers to households. The paper assesses {{the relative importance of}} these transfers for welfare and poverty in Moldova, the poorest country in Europe. A longitudinal analysis based on panel data reveals that private transfers and social insurance transfers are effective in improving welfare and reducing poverty whereas <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> transfers have little or no effect. Social insurance and <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> seem to have swapped roles. Social insurance is most relevant for lifting people out of poverty while <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> - if anything - has a small role in protecting the non-poor from falling into poverty. We also find that the different types of transfers do not crowd-out each other and that social insurance may in fact reinforce the capacity of private transfers to reduce poverty. Such findings have several policy implications for the near future: a) Poor households in FSU transitional economies remain highly vulnerable to shocks in public and private transfers; b) the 2008 - 2009 recession is likely to expose this vulnerability and result in a surge in poverty larger than expected and c) the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>systems</b> remain in great need of pro-poor reforms and cannot currently provide an adequate protection from economic shocks.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a stock take of the {{financial}} incentives to work present in New Zealand’s <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide a basis for research on problems facing the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> and dilemmas that would be likely to arise when considering potential initiatives to address such problems. The current financial incentives to work contained in the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> reflect efforts to tailor different financial incentives to different groups in the population. No single structure of financial incentives is appropriate for all people and at all times. It is therefore necessary from time to time to consider whether existing financial incentives continue to meet government objectives, such as encouraging work among different groups in the population. Improving the structure of financial incentives, however, defies simple solutions and requires trade-offs between competing and conflicting objectives to be made. In order to set the scene for later discussion, this paper begins with a brief description of the evolution of New Zealand’s <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system.</b> This paper then moves on to discuss the financial returns from social assistance programmes and the distribution {{of the financial}} disincentives to work present in the current <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system.</b> A number of further considerations are then discussed, particularly accommodation and childcare costs and the length of time that people tend to spend on social welfare benefits.

The debate about social tourism or welfare migration has been acrimonious in the last years. The Member States face new challenges concerning the possibility of excluding economically inactive European Union (EU) citizens from other Member States from special non-contributory social benefits. However, if on one hand we have the need to protect the financial sustainability of the Member States, as non-active EU citizens from other Member States can represent a burden on their <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>systems,</b> on the other hand, we also need to respect one of the EU’s most basilar principles: the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, and closely examines the four countries’ different experiences with Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) schemes. A process-tracing methodology uses data from secondary sources, archival material, and 46 interviews to construct an actor-centred model and pursue a multiple-causality, historical approach. Outcomes are shown to result from interactions among central governments, religious organizations, secular organizations and territorial actors; and also from destabilizing forces. It is assumed that <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> beneficiaries are forced to rely on these actors, whose attitudes are found to vary significantly due to their different interests, subjective perceptions of fairness, and preferences. Case histories of the four countries show that the periods prior to the 1970 s were marked by minimal central government interest; indifferent, hostile, and/or divided secular organizations; and governmental partnerships with religious organizations. In the post- 1970 s periods, destabilizing forces co-occurring with centre-left governments resulted in new policies and changes, with relevant actors/organizations gradually welcoming pluralistic <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>systems.</b> The existence and extent of GMI schemes has been the principal factor differentiating <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> developments among the four countries in more recent decades: Portugal {{is the only country}} with a national GMI, Italy and Spain have solely regional schemes, and Greece has no GMI at all. Because GMIs cut across traditional <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> categories and are often linked with overall welfare system restructuring, establishment of GMIs and their subsequent maintenance require the co-occurrence of destabilizing forces and strong pro-GMI coalitions. Portugal exhibits the highest level of pro-GMI consensus nationwide, Greece the lowest,while Italy and Spain occupy intermediate positions. The institutional empowerment of territorial actors in the latter two countries was a precondition to emergence of local schemes, while destabilizing forces and strong local pro-GMI coalitions greatly increased the odds for establishing and maintaining them.

40|$|Poverty and its {{solution}} in <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>systems</b> This work deals with problems {{of poverty and}} possibilities of its solution. At first, it follows history of this phenomenon in our country. After the theoretical determination of poverty follows individual conceptions of poverty such as absolute and relative, objektive and subjective, simple and complex.

A definition of individual conceptions is important for research work to determine size and intensity of poverty in a particular society. Today, we have two main social - political instruments. They help to establish the formal limit of poverty. There are minimum living standard and subsistence level. The amount of minimum living standard and minimally guaranteed wage influences motivation of people to work. The passing of Act No. 111 / 2006 Sb., on assistance in material indigence, established a new legislative framework regulating this questions.

These distortions refer to {{the discrepancy between the}} cost of formal social security for the employer and the worker's valuation of the received service (social distortion) : the differences in social security benefits received by salaried and self-employed formal workers (occupational distortion); and the discrepancy {{caused by the}} cost in employing a formal instead of an informal worker (informal distortion). Based on recently collected information concerning Colombian workers'willingness to pay for several packages of social security benefits, the study calculates that social distortions range from 2 to 27 percent of the workers'labor earnings; the occupational distortion amounts to 50 percent of formal salaried workers'earnings; and the informal distortions represent between 45 and 56 percent of formal workers'labor income. Results indicate that valuations of the contributive and noncontributive protection systems {{play a key role in}} explaining these distortions. In addition, the Colombian social protection system thereby places a hefty tax on the formal worker (and employer) while transferring resources to the informal worker, but these distortions are not sufficient to revert differentials in earnings among formal and informal workers.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to review and compare the performance of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> non-contributory income support programs for the poor within the context of the Social Protection (SP) systems in European and other advanced economies. The performance and design of targeted income support to the poor differ across the advanced countries analyzed. Yet in most European countries, <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> can be seen as an instrument of last resort after all other components of the Social Protection system have contributed to lower inequality and reduced poverty levels. The European Social Protection systems are effective and efficient, but reforms are needed as a response to changing socio-economic conditions. Of special importance are the reforms with respect to the provision of incentives for beneficiaries to become more active on the labor market, for providers to operate to be more critical when handing our benefits by changing entitlement rights as well as the containing operational costs. After all, it is the design and adjustment to local circumstances that matter when the role of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> in a broader SP system has been well understood. The first section of the paper provides the background necessary for analyzing the differences in the construction of the Welfare States in the various countries. The discussion is focused on the role of various components of SP systems and illustrates the large international differences in their components and their role in alleviating poverty and reducing inequality. The second section provides details on the characteristics of the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> (targeted income support to the poor) programs in the nine European countries.

These size, shape and design aspects of the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> make South Africa an interesting case study and the objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a detailed interrogation of the South African case. Are cash transfers well-targeted and redistributive? Do we know if they enhance human capital accumulation? Are they fiscally sustainable?

After a description of the historical background and the evolution of the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> of South Africa, we provide an analysis of the impact on poverty and review the impacts on micro-outcomes such as health, education and labour supply. We find that the South African social assistance is a very effective policy instrument to fight poverty and to improve education and health especially of children living in poor households. Such impacts are crucial for longer-run poverty alleviation.

40|$|Prior to 1982 the Parliament of Canada and the legislatures of {{the provinces}} were the {{sovereign}} powers within their respective constitutional areas of legislative jurisdiction. In 1982, {{with the passage}} by the British Parliament of the Canada Act 1982, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (hereinafter {{referred to as the}} "Charter") became part of the "supreme law of Canada". This thesis is composed of three distinct parts. The first part provides an overview of the Ontario <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> in its current state of transition. The second part consists of a response to the essential question of equality: what is the worth of a human being? A response to this question is sought within the framework of Western traditions. Based mostly upon {{a review of the literature}} and an analysis of the section 15 jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada the third part consists of an evaluation of the likelihood of the courts interpreting section 15 of the Charter with regard to cases involving the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> in a manner that is consistent with the conception of human worth and dignity developed in the first two parts of the thesis. It is proposed that the idea of equality requires a <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> to recognize the satisfaction of need which is outside the control of the individual, with need being understood to comprise the element of social participation, to be its goal and guiding principle.

40|$|The eastern {{expansion}} of the EU resembles German unification in its mometousness. Whereas the latter led to a 26 % increase in {{the population of the}} Federal Republic, the former will increase the population of the EU by 28 % if all ten entry aspirants are accepted. A special problem will be posed by migration. In view of the existing wage differences between eastern and western Eurpean countries, a massive westward migration can be expected after EU expansion. A temporary east-to-west migration up to the time that the eastern countries have created an efficient capital stock makes economic sense if it is driven by wage differences and meets with a flexible labour market. Migration does not make economic sense, however, if, and to the extent to which, it is induced by the current <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>systems.</b> Moreover, welfare-motivated migration would create competition among western European states to frighten off potential migrants, which would lead to an erosion of the traditional social welfare state. If the EU plan incorporated a limitation of the free movement of labour, the beneficial migration would also be stopped. A better solution would be to limit access to the western social systems, at least for a transitional period in order to filter out migration induced by differing social standards. An EU-wide application of the home-country principle in the granting of social benefits would achieve this goal. ...|$|R

Based on the findings, this report describes the nature and backgrounds of the problems in relation to the behaviour, appearance and language of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> beneficiaries who are receiving route counselling to help them find work. The study also provides an insight into how case managers deal with these complex issues. What scope do they see for steering their clients on this point, and does it make sense to impose sanctions in order to help them find 'a neat way out of social assistance'?
