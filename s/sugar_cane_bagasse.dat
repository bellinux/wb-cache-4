40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the application of numerical image measurement techniques and fundamental continuum mechanics to measurement of the large strain kinematic behaviour of prepared <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> and <b>bagasse.</b> A generic, standœalone software tool was created for measuring the twoœdimensional finite strains of solidœphase historic continua, via time series of digital images from filmed experiments. This software, referred to for simplicity as Image Tensor Analysis (ITA), combines numerical image displacement measurement using the FFT direct crossœcorrelation, with the classical theory of continuum mechanics, to produce transient kinematic and material output that is concurrent with Lagrangian finite element models. The ITA software presents a new platform for data acquisition from prepared <b>cane</b> and <b>bagasse</b> experiments, as well as providing a means for proofing finite element simulations of bagasse milling. Furthermore, the accurate measurement of fibre kinematics, coupled with mechanical data, provides sufficient information for estimating parameter values within the solidœphase material model, with a reverse finite element procedure. A small series of confined flatœplaten uniaxial compression experiments were conducted and the ITA software was calibrated for the complex fibroœporous process materials, prepared <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> and <b>bagasse.</b> Problems with experimental procedures were identified and a subsequent series of experiments conducted. Refined experimental practice resulted in improved initial sample homogeneity and repeatable sample deformation measurements. The ITA software was also employed in an investigation into bagasse behaviour during compression between grooved surfaces, providing insight into juice flow through the bagasse fibre blanket. A series of twoœroll milling experiments were conducted, with the aim of quantifying the deformation behaviour of prepared <b>cane</b> and <b>bagasse</b> during rolling. The experiments were inhibited by apparatus limitations, resulting in poor repetition of the deformation measurements. However, the ITA software was shown to be capable of measuring the large biaxial material strains, and solid conclusions were made in regard to the kinematic behaviour of the solidœphase fibre. It was identified that improved apparatus is required to obtain suitable ITA deformation results for direct comparison with finite element simulations of the twoœroll milling regime...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> residue <b>bagasse</b> is an underutilized {{renewable}} agricultural material. Bagasse {{is generally}} grey-yellow to pale green in color. It is bulky and quite nonuniform in particle size. As it is produced at the sugar mills, bagasse {{is used as}} fuel in the power plant. However, wherever there is large scale production of sugarcane, there will be excess bagasse which must be disposed of by other methods such as burning, dumping, land burial, etc. Thus, an economic use of the excess bagasse could both increase the profits of the sugar mill and solve an environmental problem. In this work an attempt {{has been made to}} upgrade the value of this agricultural residue by bonding with resin to produce composites for suitable applications.

40|$|A major {{strategic}} goal {{in making}} ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass a cost-competitive liquid transport fuel {{is to reduce}} the cost of production of cellulolytic enzymes that hydrolyse lignocellulosic substrates to fermentable sugars. Current production systems for these enzymes, namely microbes, are not economic. One way to substantially reduce production costs is to express cellulolytic enzymes in plants at levels that are high enough to hydrolyse lignocellulosic biomass. <b>Sugar</b> <b>cane</b> fibre (<b>bagasse)</b> is the most promising lignocellulosic feedstock for conversion to ethanol in the tropics and subtropics. Cellulolytic enzyme production in <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> will have a substantial impact on the economics of lignocellulosic ethanol production from bagasse. We therefore generated transgenic <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> accumulating three cellulolytic enzymes, fungal cellobiohydrolase I (CBH I), CBH II and bacterial endoglucanase (EG), in leaves using the maize PepC promoter as an alternative to maize Ubi 1 for controlling transgene expression. Different subcellular targeting signals were shown to have a substantial impact on the accumulation of these enzymes; the CBHs and EG accumulated to higher levels when fused to a vacuolar-sorting determinant than to an endoplasmic reticulum-retention signal, while EG was produced in the largest amounts when fused to a chloroplast-targeting signal. These results are the first demonstration of the expression and accumulation of recombinant CBH I, CBH II and EG in <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> and represent a significant first step towards the optimization of cellulolytic enzyme expression in <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> for the economic production of lignocellulosic ethanol...|$|R
