The misattribution error reflects an adaptive memory system in which information that does not require people to remember all the <b>specific</b> <b>details</b> is lost. <b>Specific</b> <b>details</b> would only be preserved in situations where the <b>specific</b> <b>details</b> need to be remembered, such as memories of a highly emotional experience. The use of semantic gists may be a fundamental mechanism of memory, allowing people to categorize information and generalize across situations, a function associated with higher intelligence.|$|R
