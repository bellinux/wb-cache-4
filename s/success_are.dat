For example, biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding <b>success</b> <b>are</b> not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} {{now appears to}} be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The perceived decline {{may be due to the}} loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging <b>success</b> <b>are</b> all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the adult male Eurasian sparrowhawk loses {{a small amount}} of weight while feeding his mate before she lays eggs, and also when the young are large and require more food. The weight of the adult female is highest in May, when laying eggs, and lowest in August after {{the breeding}} cycle is complete. A study suggested that the number of eggs and subsequent breeding <b>success</b> <b>are</b> dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male is feeding her.|$|E

5|$|During the game, players {{describe}} their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as {{picking up a}} letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills {{and the difficulty of}} the task. In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of <b>success</b> <b>are</b> influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.|$|E
5|$|Field {{attended}} Macquarie University {{to receive}} training {{in early childhood}} education, and founded The Wiggles with fellow students Murray Cook, Greg Page and former bandmate Jeff Fatt in 1991. He worked as a preschool teacher {{for two years before}} the success of The Wiggles led him to focus on children's music full-time. Despite Field's strong dislike of touring, The Wiggles {{became one of the most}} successful and active groups in Australia. Field, who wore blue while performing with the group, was responsible for the production aspects of their stage and television shows, CDs, and DVDs. His issues with chronic pain and depression, which almost forced him out of the group at the height of their <b>success,</b> <b>are</b> well-documented.|$|E
5|$|Variation exists within all {{populations of}} organisms. This occurs partly because random {{mutations}} {{arise in the}} genome of an individual organism, and offspring can inherit such mutations. Throughout {{the lives of the}} individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the abiotic environment. Individuals with certain variants of the trait may survive and reproduce more than individuals with other, less successful, variants; therefore, the population evolves. Factors that affect reproductive <b>success</b> <b>are</b> also important, including sexual selection (now often included in natural selection) and fecundity selection.|$|E
30|$|Clutch size, {{hatching}} and emergence <b>successes</b> <b>were</b> determined {{following the}} methodology described by Miller (1999) using records from all beaches. We calculated {{the number of}} eggs laid per year, average of nests/year and average of nests/month. Hatching <b>success</b> <b>was</b> defined as “the proportion of hatchlings that hatched out of their shells respectively” (Miller 1999). Emergence <b>success</b> <b>was</b> defined as “the proportion of hatchlings that reached the beach surface” (Miller 1999).

5|$|In a 25 August 2009 ICF article, ICF Canoeing for All Committee and Canoe Kayak Canada's Domestic Development Director John Edwards thanked {{efforts of}} the paddlers {{involved}} in the paddleability events for the 2009 championships. Edwards stated that the efforts for paddleability's <b>success</b> <b>are</b> twofold. The first is for inclusion into the 2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Athens, Greece. Once this is recognized, the next {{goal is to get}} Special Olympic programs at a national level for inclusion into the 2016 Summer Paralympics. The second, a shorter-term one, is to have 24 nations from three continents participate at next year's canoe sprint world championships in Poznań. Besides the medalists from this year's world championships being from Italy, the United States, Canada, Brazil and France, other participants included Great Britain and Portugal. The process to include paddleability into the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil began on 1 October 2009 and approval was reached on 16 July 2010.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that gifted students are universally gifted {{in all areas of}} academics, and these misconceptions can have a variety of negative emotional effects on a gifted child. Unrealistically high expectations of academic <b>success</b> <b>are</b> often placed on gifted students by both parents and teachers. This pressure can cause gifted students to experience high levels of anxiety, to become perfectionists, and to develop a fear of failure. Gifted students come to define themselves and their identity through their giftedness, which can be problematic as their entire self-concept can be shaken when they do not live up to the unrealistically high expectations of others.|$|E
25|$|Recruitment is {{the number}} of new young fish that enter a {{population}} in a given year. The size of fish populations can fluctuate by orders of magnitude over time, and five to 10-fold variations in abundance are usual. This variability applies across time spans ranging from a year to hundreds of years. Year to year fluctuations in the abundance of short lived forage fish can be nearly as great as the fluctuations that occur over decades or centuries. This suggests that fluctuations in reproductive and recruitment <b>success</b> <b>are</b> prime factors behind fluctuations in abundance. Annual fluctuations often seem random, and recruitment success often has a poor relationship to adult stock levels and fishing effort. This makes prediction difficult.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} Riis's {{autobiography}} {{lies in the}} description of his origins as a social reformer. His early experiences in Ribe gave Riis a yardstick with which to measure tenement dwellers’ quality of life.

25|$|The black-necked stork {{is widely}} {{scattered}} and nowhere found in high densities, {{making it difficult}} for populations to be reliably estimated. The Sri Lankan population has been estimated to be about 50 birds while the species has become very rare in Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. They may be extinct in the Sundaic region. The combined South and South-east Asian population is placed at less than 1000 birds. A 2011 study found the population in south-western Uttar Pradesh to be stable, although population growth rates may decline with {{an increase in the number}} of dry years or land use changes that permanently remove the number of breeding pairs. The Australian population has been optimistically estimated at about 20,000 birds while a more conservative estimate suggests about 10,000 birds. They are threatened by habitat destruction, the draining of shallow wetlands, overfishing, pollution, collision with electricity wires and hunting. Few breeding populations with high breeding <b>success</b> <b>are</b> known primarily due to lack of field work. It is evaluated as near threatened on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
500|$|Criteria for {{the success}} of the implant {{supported}} dental prosthetic varies from study to study, but can be broadly classified into failures due to the implant, soft tissues or prosthetic components or a lack of satisfaction {{on the part of the}} patient.
