5|$|Scolopacidae is a large, diverse {{family of}} small to {{medium-sized}} shorebirds, including the <b>sandpipers,</b> curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers, and phalaropes. Most species eat small invertebrates picked {{out of the}} mud or soil. Different lengths of legs and bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{pelicans}} and double-crested cormorants {{are mainly}} found on cliffs {{along the coast}} and on seastacks, while <b>sandpipers</b> and gulls inhabit the seacoast and inland areas. Inland, freshwater-dependent birds such as the common merganser, osprey, red-shouldered hawk, great blue heron, and Steller's jay {{are a few of}} the bird species that have been documented. At least 400 bird species have been documented in the forestlands.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, species {{arrive from}} the north, some, such as black-tailed godwits, curlew <b>sandpipers</b> and little stints just passing through, pausing {{for a few}} days to refuel, others staying for the winter. This is also a good time to see bearded reedlings. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, {{northern}} gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds.|$|E

50|$|The Terek <b>sandpiper</b> {{likes to}} {{associate}} with ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres), smallish calidrids, and Charadrius (but maybe not Pluvialis) plovers; a vagrant bird at Paraty (Rio de Janeiro state) was noted to pair up with a spotted <b>sandpiper</b> (Actitis macularius). Thus {{it may be that}} the Terek <b>sandpiper</b> under natural conditions may mate with common <b>sandpiper</b> (A. hypoleucos), the Old World sister species of spotted <b>sandpiper</b> (A. macularius). As hybridisation in shorebirds is extremely commonplace and Actitis is among the closer relatives of the Terek <b>sandpiper,</b> such pairings (should they indeed occur) may produce hybrid offspring.|$|R

5000|$|An {{apparently}} new <b>sandpiper</b> species ("Cooper's <b>sandpiper</b> Tringa/Calidris cooperi") {{was described}} in 1858 based on a specimen collected in 1833 on Long Island, New York. A similar bird was collected in 1981 at Stockton, New South Wales, Australia. These are probably hybrids between the curlew <b>sandpiper</b> ("Calidris" [...] ferruginea) and the sharp-tailed <b>sandpiper</b> (Philomachus acuminatus/Calidris acuminata).|$|R
50|$|Species {{in which}} this has been {{recorded}} photographically include the following species: short-billed dowitcher, marbled godwit, least <b>sandpiper,</b> common snipe, long-billed curlew, pectoral <b>sandpiper,</b> semipalmated <b>sandpiper,</b> Eurasian oystercatcher and bar-tailed godwit (see Chandler 2002 and external links).|$|R
5|$|Species present {{all year}} round include little and great crested grebes, lapwing, redshank, tufted duck, gadwall, kingfisher, reed bunting, great spotted woodpecker, {{sparrowhawk}} and little owl. In the spring, passage waders visit the pools alongside the estuary; these include whimbrel, common, wood and green <b>sandpipers,</b> spotted redshank, common greenshank, avocet, godwit, little gull and black tern, and other migrants arriving at the reserve include wheatear, whinchat, redstart and black redstart.|$|E
5|$|The {{keys are}} a {{transitional}} area capable of hosting unexpected birds, often Caribbean species that have strayed near the mainland. The {{interior of the}} keys are frequented by warblers and the hawks that prey on them. Coastal zones are habitat for ruddy turnstones and least <b>sandpipers.</b> Gulls and terns include royal terns, laughing gulls and ring-billed gulls, with brown pelicans just offshore. Wilson's plovers nest on Boca Chita Key, where nesting zones are closed during breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Wading and {{woodland}} {{birds are}} year-round residents of Pettigrew State Park. The banks of Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River provide {{an abundance of}} cover and food for <b>sandpipers,</b> great blue herons, great egrets, and green herons. The woods are home to bobwhites, pileated woodpeckers, woodcocks, red-cockaded woodpeckers, and mourning doves. Songbirds found at the park include prairie and prothonotary warblers, common yellowthroats and northern parulas.|$|E
50|$|Birds that {{frequent}} {{the area}} include Arctic loon, Arctic tern, Baird's <b>sandpiper,</b> black-bellied plover, buff-breasted <b>sandpiper,</b> Canada goose, glaucous gull, golden eagle, golden plover, herring gull, king eider, Lapland longspur, long-tailed jaeger, mallard, northern phalarope, oldsquaw, parasitic jaeger, pectoral <b>sandpiper,</b> pintail, raven, red-breasted merganser, red-throated loon, rough-legged hawk, sanderling, semipalmated <b>sandpiper,</b> short-eared owl, snow bunting, snowy owl, tree sparrow, water pipit, whistling swan, willow ptarmigan, and yellow-billed loon.|$|R

50|$|The common <b>sandpiper</b> (Actitis hypoleucos) {{is a small}} Palearctic wader. This {{bird and}} its American sister species, the spotted <b>sandpiper</b> (A. macularia), make up the genus Actitis. They are parapatric and replace each other geographically; stray birds of either species may settle down with breeders of the other and hybridize. Hybridization has also been {{reported}} between the common <b>sandpiper</b> and the green <b>sandpiper,</b> a basal species of the closely related shank genus Tringa.|$|R
5|$|Each year in {{late summer}} {{thousands}} of black swans and ducks descend on the area as the inland waterways they inhabit dry up. Waterbirds such as pelicans, cormorants, oyster catchers and terns are common often year round. Egrets, ibis, herons and spoonbills feed on the seagrass and fairy wrens, chats, fantails and thornbills feed on insects and plants amongst the samphire. Each September stints and <b>sandpipers</b> arrive from the Northern Hemisphere in a spectacular display. With the abundance of birdlife the area attracts birds of prey with swamp harriers, collared sparrowhawks, black-shouldered kites, kestrels and little falcons are all seen in the skies over St Kilda.|$|E
5|$|Aside from that, Damai is {{also one}} of the perfect places in Sarawak to see the Irrawaddy dolphin as the mammals can be spotted along the Salak River, Santubong estuary and at the Bako-Buntal Bay. The Santubong Peninsula offers a few sites for bird {{watching}} with the BirdLife International Organisation has registered the whole area on Bako-Buntal Bay as an 'Important Bird Area'. Between October and March, the Buntal River become an important wintering ground for bird migration. A number of birds that have been spotted by the Malaysian Nature Society (Kuching Branch) at Buntal including a variety of plovers, <b>sandpipers,</b> egrets, terns and other rare migrants, while resident birds including collared kingfisher, the white-bellied sea eagle and brahminy kite.|$|E
5|$|In {{spring and}} early summer, migrant birds {{including}} the little gull, black tern, Temminck's stint and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north; some, such as whimbrels, curlew <b>sandpipers</b> and little stints, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds. Large numbers of ducks winter along the coast, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, goldeneyes and northern pintails. Red-throated divers are usually on the sea, and brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae. Barn owls and sometimes hen harriers quarter the marshes in winter, and snow bunting flocks {{can be found on the}} beaches. Thousands of geese, mainly pink-footed, roost at Holkham.|$|E

5|$|Located in the Northern Rockies, Missoula has {{a typical}} Rocky Mountain ecology. Local {{wildlife}} includes populations of white-tailed deer, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter, rapid snowmelt on Mount Jumbo {{due to its}} steep slope leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank swallows, northern rough-winged swallows and belted kingfishers. Killdeer and spotted <b>sandpipers</b> can be seen foraging for insects along the gravel bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the pileated woodpecker. The rivers also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks. The parks also host a variety of snakes such as racers, garter snakes, and rubber boa.|$|E
