5|$|A {{number of}} <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> species are {{commensal}} with other organisms. Certain crabs and hermit crabs seek out sea anemones {{and place them}} on their shells for protection, and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection by being {{in close proximity to}} the stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the <b>sea</b> <b>anemone.</b> Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E
5|$|A typical <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> is {{a single}} polyp {{attached}} to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near {{the surface of the}} water. The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.|$|E
5|$|Most Actiniaria do {{not form}} hard parts {{that can be}} {{recognized}} as fossils, but a few fossils of sea anemones do exist; Mackenzia, from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of Canada, is the oldest fossil identified as a <b>sea</b> <b>anemone.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>anemones</b> are a {{group of}} marine, predatory animals of the order Actiniaria. They are named after the anemone, a {{terrestrial}} flowering plant, because of the colourful appearance of many. <b>Sea</b> <b>anemones</b> are classified in the phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, subclass Hexacorallia. [...] As cnidarians, <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> are related to corals, jellyfish, tube-dwelling anemones, and Hydra. Unlike jellyfish, <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> {{do not have a}} medusa stage in their life cycle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>anemones</b> are a {{group of}} water-dwelling, predatory animals of the order Actiniaria. They are named for the anemone, a {{terrestrial}} flower. <b>Sea</b> <b>anemones</b> are classified in the phylum Cnidaria , class Anthozoa, subclass Hexacorallia. Anthozoa often have large polyps that allow for digestion of larger prey and also lack a medusa stage. As cnidarians, <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> are related to corals, jellyfish, tube-dwelling anemones, and Hydra.|$|R
50|$|Corynactis annulata, the {{strawberry}} anemone, {{is a bright}} pink colonial anthozoan similar in body form to <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> and scleractinian stony corals. Unlike the true <b>sea</b> <b>anemones,</b> this species is a colonial animal of the order Corallimorpharia.|$|R
5|$|Anthozoans exhibit {{great powers}} of regeneration; lost parts swiftly regrow and the <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> Aiptasia pallida can be vivisected in the {{laboratory}} {{and then returned to}} the aquarium where it will heal. They are capable of a variety of asexual means of reproduction including fragmentation, longitudinal and transverse fission and budding. Sea anemones for example can crawl across a surface leaving behind them detached pieces of the pedal disc which develop into new clonal individuals. Anthopleura species divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and patterning. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing on the column before the <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> tears itself apart. Zoanthids are capable of budding off new individuals.|$|E
5|$|A <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> {{is capable}} of {{changing}} its shape dramatically. The column and tentacles have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets of muscle and can lengthen and contract, as well as bend and twist. The gullet and mesenteries can evert (turn inside out), or the oral disc and tentacles can retract inside the gullet, with the sphincter closing the aperture; during this process, the gullet folds transversely and water is discharged through the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones breed by {{liberating}} {{sperm and}} eggs through the mouth into the sea. The resulting fertilized eggs develop into planula larvae which, after being planktonic for a while, {{settle on the}} seabed and develop directly into juvenile polyps. Sea anemones also breed asexually, by breaking in half or into smaller pieces which regenerate into polyps. Sea anemones are sometimes kept in reef aquariums; the global trade in marine ornamentals for this purpose is expanding and threatens <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> populations in some localities, as the trade depends on collection from the wild.|$|E
5000|$|Thalassianthidae is {{a family}} of <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> that {{contains}} the genera Actineria, Cryptodendrum, Heterodactyla, and Thalassianthus. [...] These <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> do not host any varieties of clownfishes, but {{have been associated with}} some species of commensal anemone shrimp.|$|R
25|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>anemones</b> {{are common}} on reefs. The tentacles of <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> bristle with tiny {{harpoons}} (nematocysts) primed with toxins, and are an effective deterrent against most predators. However, saddle butterflyfish, which {{are up to}} 30cm (12in) long, have developed a resistance to these toxins. Saddle butterflyfish usually flutter gently rather than swim. But {{in the presence of}} their preferred food, <b>sea</b> <b>anemones,</b> this gentleness disappears, and the butterflyfish dash in and out, ripping off the anemone tentacles.|$|R

Three species of <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> they discovered were named for them by Dr. Oscar Calgren at the Lund University's Department of Zoology in Sweden: Palythoa rickettsii, Isometridium rickettsi, and Phialoba steinbecki.|$|E
5|$|The lagoons {{behind the}} shingle beach at Salthouse and Cley are salty {{due to the}} {{percolation}} of seawater through the bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including the starlet <b>sea</b> <b>anemone,</b> lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, and lagoon cockle.

Most descriptions of the preparatory activity refer to Metridium senile (Parker, 1919; Pantin...|$|R
5|$|Since the anemone lacks a rigid skeleton, the {{contractile}} cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which {{acts as a}} valve, keeping the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume and making it rigid. When the longitudinal muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} anchor the animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{plants and}} {{therefore}} incapable of photosynthesis themselves, many sea anemones form an important facultative mutualistic relationship with certain single-celled algae species that {{reside in the}} animals' gastrodermal cells, especially in the tentacles and oral disc. These algae may be either zooxanthellae, zoochlorellae or both. The <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> benefits from {{the products of the}} algae's photosynthesis, namely oxygen and food in the form of glycerol, glucose and alanine; the algae in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro-feeders, which the sea anemones actively maintain. The algae also benefit by being protected by the sea anemone's stinging cells, reducing the likelihood of being eaten by herbivores. In the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), the colour of the anemone is largely dependent on the proportions and identities of the zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae present. The hidden anemone (Lebrunia coralligens) has a whorl of seaweed-like pseudotentacles, rich in zooxanthellae, and an inner whorl of tentacles. A daily rhythm sees the pseudotentacles spread widely in the daytime for photosynthesis, but they are retracted at night, at which time the tentacles expand to search for prey.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E

5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and {{this is the type of}} muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E

25|$|A. ocellaris are {{reliant on}} <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> for shelter (they have a {{symbiotic}} relationship with the <b>sea</b> <b>anemone).</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>anemone</b> are protection for the fish and their nests. This is because when A. ocellaris are in the open waters, they have {{a higher risk of}} predation. It is postulated that the fanning behavior of the fish and removal of parasites promotes the health of sea anemones which contain A. ocellaris fish. In addition, the anemone provides protection for the fish with its tentacles, however, the fish’s mucus protection prevents it from being stung by the tentacles. The presence of the clownfish can be interpreted as a lure to attract potential anemone's preys close to the tentacles. And the clownfish can also defend the anemone against some reef fishes which could eat the tentacles.|$|E

5000|$|Anthopleura stellula {{is unusual}} among <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> {{in that it}} can divide by {{transverse}} fission. This is not a common method of asexual reproduction among these <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> but tends to occur {{as a reaction to}} stress, such as when an anemone is experiencing a lowering of the salinity. The fission involves the animal forming a transverse constriction before dividing in two, the oral portion growing a new pedal disc and the basal portion growing a new oral disc and pharynx. There are a few other <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> such as Gonactinia prolifera that can divide in this way, and all are rather small, primitive <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> with simple internal structures. Internal reorganisation often starts before the fission process commences. During the fission process, an indentation occurs halfway down the column, new tentacles begin to develop below the constriction, and the two portions separate.|$|R
