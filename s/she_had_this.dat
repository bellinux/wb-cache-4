In 2005, Westenra visited Ghana to publicise her project, [...] "Bikes for Ghana", and actively helped with fundraising to purchase bicycles for young girls, allowing them {{to get to their}} schools from outlying surrounding areas. When she was later interviewed about this charity work, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> to say: [...] "I met girls who had been given bikes and I could see how much it meant to them. We wanted to borrow one just for a photo and they wouldn't let them go; they were really reluctant". 2 May 2007, SYD Edition, LOCAL: 5.|$|E
500|$|Shabazz befriended Myrlie Evers-Williams, {{the widow}} of Medgar Evers, and Coretta Scott King, {{the widow of}} Martin Luther King Jr. They had the common {{experience}} of losing their activist husbands {{at a young age}} and raising their children as single mothers. The press came to refer to the three, who made numerous joint public appearances, as the [...] "Movement widows". Evers-Williams and King were frequent guests at Medgar Evers College, and Shabazz occasionally visited the King Center in Atlanta. Writing about Shabazz, Evers-Williams described her as a [...] "free spirit, in the best sense of the word. When she laughed, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> beauty; when she smiled, it lit up the whole room." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1956, Gittings {{traveled}} to California {{on the advice}} of Donald Webster Cory, to visit the office of the new ONE, Inc., an early homophile organization that dedicated itself to providing support to homosexuals in the US. While in California, she met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who had co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in San Francisco. [...] "She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift and sandals. I remember <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> satchel, a backpack— I'd never seen anything like it. Or her", Lyon remembered. At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional bisexual character, not even homosexual. [...] "Even then I was pretty assertive...What were they doing with a name like that? It wasn't very nice of me, but they seemed to take it with reasonably good spirits." ...|$|E

500|$|Aurora's blurb on the Disney Princess website once {{cited the}} {{character}} as [...] "gentle and loving". Walt Disney introduced Aurora to Costa as [...] "a very layered character", describing her as [...] "different. She's calm, yet she's playful. She {{has a sense}} of humor, and she has an imagination." [...] Despite popular opinion that Aurora is a very passive character, Costa believes that the princess is actually [...] "very strong", citing her urge to defy her guardians as an example of her strength, while referring to the character as [...] "a beautiful personification of femininity." [...] Raised exclusively by three women in a very sheltered environment, Aurora had never been exposed to a man prior to meeting Phillip. Costa believes that, because of this, Aurora is [...] "innately romantic" [...] as opposed to simply lonely, explaining, there [...] "was a certain part of her that maybe she didn’t realize that was just so romantic and maybe expecting something that she didn’t even know what", and credits {{the fact that she was}} raised by three older women as opposed to her parents with making her [...] "a little bit older, and yet, <b>she</b> ... <b>had</b> <b>this</b> young outreaching spirit." [...] A very loving character, Aurora enjoyed her lonely life as much as she did because she had never experienced anything else. Additionally, the character's close companionship with woodland creatures is used to demonstrate that she is a loving individual.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Björk starred on {{her acting}} debut Dancer in the Dark. Whilst {{she worked on}} the film, she also began {{producing}} her next album, writing new music and teaming with new collaborators. She {{had to go to}} Denmark to work on the film and there was nothing going on. She was lying on the beach whilst looking at the ocean, with a ghetto blaster listening to producer Thomas Knak's music. When she realised he was from Copenhagen, she called him up". [...] "Cocoon", produced by Knak, {{was one of the last}} songs to be written for the album; its melody came to Björk in a sudden rush and she contacted him. She made a long-distance, late-night phone call to Knak in Denmark, and woke him up. [...] "I didn't have any track of time so she didn't really know that I was asleep. She was explaining that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> melody in her head and maybe, if I had the time, she would still have two or three weeks to decide if this track could be worked on", said the producer. Knak took it as a chance to make a more minimal track, similar to his own releases. He liked the idea of having two songs on the album, and immediately after he put down the phone, he started working. His original treatment of [...] "Cocoon", made with an Ensoniq ASR-10, appeared relatively intact in the final version. Knak elaborated: [...] "She had two changes: one for one semitone up and another for I think about 20BPM slower or something. I don't really make music so I'm not really used to thinking could the singer really sing in a tempo. From there she started working on the lyrics and one more melody for the vocal".|$|E

But what happened is, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> great work ethic." ...|$|E

Airedale performed a Garth Brooks song and Winston the impersonating Turtle sang a Bee Gees song. Julius performed a Marvin Gaye song; Julius was a favorite when he {{appeared on}} The Oprah Winfrey Show. [...] "As soon as I brought out Julius, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> look on her face, wondering what I was about to do," [...] Fator said. [...] "Once I started into Marvin Gaye, she fell out of her chair." ...|$|E

In short, though she said no word, there was a warmth in her meeting with Lady Elizabeth, on their return, that gave Theodora hopes.|$|E

I don't think you can easily talk your way out of anything with them. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>this</b> trick where <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a veteran's ring ... which is actually a really terrible thing to do. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> the notion that, if it will help her out, she will go to extremes.
