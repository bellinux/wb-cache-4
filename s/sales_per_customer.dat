50|$|For example, a point-of-sale {{terminal}} (POS terminal, {{a computerized}} cash register) in a busy supermarket collects huge volumes of raw data each day about customers' purchases. However, {{this list of}} grocery items and their prices and the time and date of purchase does not yield much information until it is processed. Once processed and analyzed by a software program or even by a researcher using a pen and paper and a calculator, this raw data may indicate the particular items that each customer buys, when they buy them, and at what price; as well, an analyst or manager could calculate the average total <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> <b>customer</b> or the average expenditure per {{day of the week}} by hour. This processed and analyzed data provides information for the manager, that the manager could then use to help her determine, for example, how many cashiers to hire and at what times. Such information could then become data for further processing, for example as part of a predictive marketing campaign. As a result of processing, raw data sometimes ends up being put in a database, which enables the raw data to become accessible for further processing and analysis in any number of different ways.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} {{determinants of}} shopping centre sales and its attendance demand; {{it is based}} on data of the specific shopping centre from the years 2007 [...] 2011. Based on a five-year monthly time series, two sales models are created. One model tracks <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> <b>customer,</b> the other deals with the shopping centre sales which are compared with the sales index of retailers. On the other hand, a model of the shopping centre attendance demand uses figures of a five-year daily time series. Independent variables with significant effect on dependent variables are identified in the theoretical part. The models are estimated using the Ordinary Least Squares estimation. In all models, seasonal influences proved to be a significant determinant. In the sales models, hypotheses of the competition effect have been verified. Furthermore, in case of the attendance demand model, weather and marketing effects were estimated as important. Surprisingly, the economic variables proved themselves to be insignificant, which could be caused by the relatively short observation period. The limiting factor of all models is also the fact that the dataset consists of one shopping centre only. It prevents the author from conducting a comprehensive examination of other important determinants of shopping centre sales and attendance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: South Africa is {{the eighth}} largest wine {{producing}} {{country in the}} world, but wine consumption in South Africa is extremely low {{when compared to other}} wine producing countries. Australia, which is the seventh largest wine producing country in the world, consumes three times more than South Africa. Wine producers and wine wholesalers continually market their wines to the public through wine shows and to restaurants by hosting wine and food evenings. South Africa is predominantly a beer drinking nation; hence the South African public should be guided in respect of making correct wine choices to accompany their meals. In upmarket restaurants this function is usually performed by a sommelier. However, most restaurants do not employ sommeliers and have to rely on the food and beverage service personnel to assist customers in this regard. Food and beverage service personnel are generally not qualified, and are also not wine consumers. There is also a lack of training provided by restaurants with regard to wine knowledge, wine service skills and wine selling skills. The current study is based on one, which was conducted by Granucci (1989) of the United States of America (USA). It is an action research study, which used the quasi-experimental approach. Interviews were conducted with two sommeliers to determine what wine knowledge, wine service skills and wine selling skills are required for the training of food and beverage service personnel in restaurants. Eighteen food and beverage service personnel in two restaurants were used as subjects for this experiment, and were divided into experimental (intervention) and control groups. The baseline average wine <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> <b>customer</b> were determined per food and beverage service person in each of the groups. Each food and beverage service person participated in a pre-test on wine knowledge. The pre-test results of the interviews and the questionnaires were used to develop the training intervention for the experimental group. Wine sales were tracked for a period of 12 weeks and were divided into three periods of four weeks. After the first four week period (baseline) the experimental group underwent four weekly training sessions of two hours each, and the sales [...] . M. Com...|$|E
40|$|In the Japanese {{town gas}} industry, {{a series of}} partial {{liberalization}} measures and other regulation changes {{have been carried out}} since {{the second half of the}} 1990 s with the aim of maintaining and expanding economic welfare and reducing prices through the promotion of competition. Nevertheless, there still remains a substantial "internal price gap" between Japanese town gas companies. For determining the cause of this, all that has been done to date is advance qualitative explanations and conduct external comparative analyses, for example as regards disparities in population density and management scale and differences in raw materials, and no particularly clear light has been cast on the relationship between factor analysis of the internal price gap and the policy and system changes. In this paper I use Gas Industry Annual Statistics of Japan to conduct a cross-sectional analysis of management indicators in the town gas industry prior to and after the policy and regulation changes. By analyzing the relationship between the factors behind the internal price gap and the policy and regulation changes, I attempt to evaluate and analyze quantitatively what kinds of policy and regulation measures could mitigate or eliminate this internal gap in the future. As a result of the evaluation and analysis I confirm that the internal price gap of town gas has a tendency to increase in accordance with the widening of the gap of capital and labor productivity between companies, and that both capital and labor productivity have a positive correlation with indicators of management efficiency such as management scale, <b>sales</b> volume <b>per</b> <b>customer,</b> and annual load factor. I find that the productivity of capital is low in public utilities. With regard to the cost, I confirm that the cost of producing town gas has a positive correlation with the reciprocal of aggregate sales volume, and thus that strong economies of scale come into play. I also confirm that supply cost and management cost have a strong negative correlation with indicators of management efficiency such as <b>sales</b> volume <b>per</b> <b>customer,</b> annual load factor, and area diffusion rate. This demonstrates that disparities of scale and management efficiency cause cost differences and give rise to internal price gap. On the other hand, when looking at a comparative analysis of 1995 and 2005 there is no evidence that the series of policy and regulation changes had any impact in the direction of reducing the internal price gap. I believe it is necessary for the town gas regulator to implement corrective measures for the internal price gap, such as the vigorous promotion of mergers and partnerships between companies, the introduction of tariff systems such as demand side management (DSM) for load-leveling, and the privatization of public utilities. These corrective measures for the internal price gap should set the clear goal for all town gas companies to achieve the present mean value of capital and labor productivity in the near future. ...|$|R

40|$|In the 21 st {{century of}} {{knowledge-based}} society, {{how to respond}} to customers in the distribution industry become more and more important than ever. It is needless to say that, in this highly-networked information society, customer satisfaction influences the future and development of enterprises. Corporate profits in the distribution industry, such as supermarkets, are simply defined as the number of customers multiplied by the average <b>sale</b> amount to <b>per</b> <b>customer.</b> In order to achieve the ultimate customer satisfaction, high impression, happiness and surprise beyond customers’ expectations are needed. To understand what customers really want and {{to meet the needs of}} them, it would be vital for companies to gather the voices of the customers through a suggestion box in the offices or stores which are directly submitted to store managers. After gathering the voices of customers in a community, it is important to put these suggestions into practice. Since the distribution industry is a labor-intensive industry and close to customers, it is necessary to accept and respect customers’ opinions sincerely. Recently, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is emphasized more than before. The only true property of enterprises must be customer satisfaction and high employee morale. An enterprise needs to coexist with the community, become “a good corporate citizen”, and earn the confidence from the society. For the credibility, to make close relation with customers is essential rather than to increase sales. It is estimated that only 4 % of voices from the customers is reached to the enterprises. The proposal of this study is how to improve customer satisfaction by gathering and analyzing the voices of the customers...|$|R

30|$|This {{research}} {{sheds light}} on the cost increase e-commerce companies incur when offering customers flexibility in selecting delivery time windows. An integrated order picking – vehicle routing problem is used to calculated this cost increase while in previous research only the vehicle routing problem is used. This integrated approach leads to efficiency gains and a higher service can be offered to customers without an increase in costs. Based {{on the results of}} the ANOVA it can be concluded that the investigated factors have a significant influence on the additional cost of allowing customers to select a delivery time window. This means that there is a significant difference in additional costs for allowing customers to choose a delivery time window for customers with a different geographical spread, for customers choosing time windows of 2 [*]h versus 4 [*]h and when more customers choose a delivery time window. In addition, the operator size is also a significant factor. When only 50 customers are considered, the average increase in total costs is 4.38 € <b>per</b> <b>customer.</b> For 100 customers, the average increase is 2.97 € <b>per</b> <b>customer</b> and for 150 customers, the average increase is 2.35 € <b>per</b> <b>customer.</b> However, this average increase ranges from 6.88 € <b>per</b> <b>customer</b> if customers are randomly spread and delivery time windows of 2 [*]h are offered in case of 50 customers to 0.69 € <b>per</b> <b>customer</b> if customers are clustered and delivery time windows of 4 [*]h are offered in case of 150 customers.|$|R
