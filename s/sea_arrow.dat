60|$|Hissing {{like the}} escape valve of a steam engine, the mighty {{creature}} fell turning and twisting into the <b>sea</b> below, my <b>arrow</b> buried completely in its carcass. I {{turned toward the}} girl. She was looking past me. It was evident {{that she had seen}} the thipdar die.|$|R
60|$|King Edward {{had taken}} every {{precaution}} to guard all the {{approaches to the}} city. The ground was in most places too soft and sandy to admit {{of the construction of}} defensive works; but the fleet was drawn up close inshore to cover the line of sand-hills by the <b>sea</b> with <b>arrows</b> and war machines, while the passages of the marshes, which extended for a considerable distance round the town, were guarded by the Earl of Lancaster and a body of chosen troops, while the other approaches to the city were covered by the English camp.|$|R
5000|$|The Crimean War {{sparked a}} sudden need for shallow-draught, {{manoeuvrable}} vessels for inshore {{work in the}} Baltic and the Black <b>Sea.</b> The <b>Arrow</b> class of six wooden-hulled screw steamers were built during 1854 to a design by the Surveyor’s Department. Construction was undertaken at two commercial yards on the Thames, R & H Green and C J Mare & Company, both of Leamouth, London. [...] Two further designs of Crimean War gunvessel were ordered during 1855, the Intrepid class and the Vigilant class. The class was built as despatch vessels, but in 1856 were re-designated as second-class gunvessels.|$|R
25|$|An {{example of}} a 'pure' hero myth is the Gunung Bonpuli myth. In the Gunung Bonpuli, the giant Wang Janggun kills the Dragon King of the West <b>Sea</b> with an <b>arrow</b> {{at the request of}} the Dragon King of the East Sea. The Dragon King of the East Sea gives his daughter's hand in marriage, and the giant Wang Janggun and his three sons become the Gunungshin, or war gods.|$|R

40|$|The usual {{monthly meeting}} of the Royal Society of Tasmania, {{was held at the}} Museum on Monday evening, October 12 th. Mr. James Barnard, Vice-President, {{occupied}} the chair, and about 20 Fellows were present. The following gentlemen, who had been previously nominated as Fellows, were balloted for and duly elected as Fellows of the Society, viz., Messrs. J. T. Triffet and T. A. Tabart. There was considerable amount of discussion on a quiver containing poisoned arrows used by the natives of the Malay Peninsula for hunting, Dr. Agnew said there was a considerable amount of discussion as to whether they maintained their poisonous qualities, and the Curator had told him that day that he had tried an experiment on a cat with a South <b>Sea</b> Island <b>arrow</b> by introducing the tip of one of the so-called poisoned arrows under the skin, and the cat received no damage or injury from it. A letter was read by the Honorary Secretary from Mr, A. B, Biggs, of Launceston, in regard to his paper on our earth tremors (read 9 th June last) Mr. Brain, {{who is in charge of}} the coal mines at Longford, gave some information respecting them. Also included are additions to the Library and presentations to the museum...|$|R
60|$|One chamber was {{allotted to}} the entire party and their single nurse. Being far up in the tower, it ventured to have two windows in the massive walls, so thick that five-and-twenty steps from the floor were needed to reach the narrow slips of glass in a frame that could be removed at will, either to admit the air or to be {{exchanged}} for solid wooden shutters to exclude storms by <b>sea</b> or <b>arrows</b> and bolts by land. The {{lower part of the}} walls was hung with very grim old tapestry, on which Holofernes' head, going into its bag, could just be detected; there were two great solid box-beds, two more pallets rolled up for the day, a chest or two, a rude table, a cross-legged chair, a few stools, and some deer and seal skins spread on the floor completed the furniture of this ladies' bower. There was, unusual luxury, a chimney with a hearth and peat fire, and a cauldron on it, with a silver and a copper basin beside it for washing purposes, never discarded by poor Queen Joanna and her old English nurse Ankaret, who had remained beside her through all the troubles of the stormy and barbarous country, and, though crippled by a fall and racked with rheumatism, was the chief comfort of the young children. She crouched at the hearth with her spinning and her beads, and exclaimed at the tossed hair and soiled hands and faces of her charges.|$|R
60|$|On {{the fourth}} day, venturing out early {{a little too}} far, I saw twenty or thirty natives upon a height not above five hundred yards from me. They were stark naked, men, women, and children, round a fire, as I could {{discover}} by the smoke. One of them spied me, and gave notice to the rest; five of them advanced toward me, leaving {{the women and children}} at the fire. I made what haste I could to the shore, and, getting into my canoe, shoved off: the savages, observing me retreat, ran after me: and before I could get far enough into the <b>sea,</b> discharged an <b>arrow</b> which wounded me deeply on the inside of my left knee: I shall carry the mark to my grave. I apprehended the arrow might be poisoned, and paddling {{out of the reach of}} their darts (being a calm day), I made a shift to suck the wound, and dress it as well as I could.|$|R
40|$|The Tasman Project of Seafloor Magnetotelluric Exploration was {{performed}} between December 1983 and April 1984 {{in order to}} investigate the electrical conductivity structure beneath the Tasman Seafloor and the Australian continental margin. Recordings were made at nine seafloor and nine land sites on a line extending from inland Australia to the Lord Howe Rise in the eastern Tasman Sea. Magnetic field recordings were made at all sites and horizontal electric field recordings at seven of the seafloor sites. In addition, oceanographic recordings were made at several of the seafloor sites, as an additional aim {{of the project was}} to provide physical oceanographic information on the Tasman Sea. Data return from the experiment was almost complete and the data quality high. All of the raw recordings have been converted into final magnetic horizontal electric field and ­oceanographic time series. An analysis of the seafloor magnetotelluric (SFMT) data has been completed. The 'results indicate that geomagnetic induction in the Tasman Sea is a three-dimensional process dependent on the large-scale shape of the Tasman Sea. The seafloor impedances have a dominantly two-dimensional form with the B-pol impedance component (the component perpendicular to the trend of the Tasman Sea) being strongly attenuated near the Australian coastline. Evidence for the three-dimensionality includes large impedance skew-angles and consistent differences between impedances estimated using the SFMT and vertical gradient sounding (VGS) methods. The spatial consistency of these results supports the hypothesis of large-scale geomagnetic induction in the Tasman <b>Sea.</b> The induction <b>arrows</b> calculated for land and seafloor sites near the Australian coast exhibit significant components parallel to the coastline, providing further evidence for a three-­dimensional process. Evidence suggests that the most appropriate data to analyse using one-dimensional MT techniques are the E-pol impedances from three sites, TP 3, TP 4 and TP 5, in the central Tasman Sea. Inversions were therefore performed on these data using delta-function and minimum-structure inversion algorithms. Delta function inversions were performed in order to investigate the one-dimensionality of the data, the depth of resolution of the and the significance of differences between the conductivity models at the different sites. Minimum-structure inversions were performed in order to produce more physically-realistic conductivity profiles, and to examine which features in the profile are definitely required by the data. In addition to these inversions, the B-pol impedance terms from the seafloor sites were used with the MT anisotropy method to determine the minimum integrated crustal resistance of the Tasman Seafloor, 107 [capital omega]. m 2. The E-pol impedance terms were used to estimate the depth to the good conductor beneath each site with the MT asymptotic method. The conductivity models obtained for sites TP 3 and TP 4 appear to a reliable conductivity profile for the Tasman Sea. The Tasman Sea profile includes a high conducting layer occurring at a depth comparable to that for similar age lithosphere in the Pacific Ocean. The differences between the SFMT and VGS impedance estimates cause some ambiguity regarding the depth to the high conducting layer with the VGS and SFMT impedances estimates suggesting depths of 100 and 200 km respectively. Comparison of the conductivity models with other geophysical results suggests the correct depth lies between 120 and 150 km. At shallow depths the TP 4 profile is more conductive than the TP 3 profile. The higher conductance at TP 4 cannot be explained by differences between the sediment layer at the two sites and is tentatively attributed to thermal effects associated with the source of an active seamount chain located near TP 4. The conductivity profile obtained for the third site, TP 5, in the Central Tasman is probably only geophysically accurate at depths greater than 200 km. The deep structure at this site is more resistive than at sites TP 4 and TP 3 to the east, a result supported by the asymptotic-method results for sites near TP 5. Confirmation of the conductivity results for the Tasman Sea will be provided by the application of three-dimensional modelling methods. In particular, thin-sheet modelling should indicate the accuracy of the assumptions made during the ID analyses described in this thesis. In addition to information on the sub-oceanic conductivity structure, the Tasman Project has provided valuable information in other areas. Induction arrows at the land and seafloor sites are currently being analysed for information on the electrical conductivity structure of the Australian continental margin. Physical oceanographic information on processes including tides, eddies, and internal waves has been obtained, and information is also available on geomagnetic source-fields in the Tasman Sea region...|$|R
