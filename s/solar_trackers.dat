25|$|For best performance, {{terrestrial}} PV systems aim {{to maximize}} the time they face the sun. <b>Solar</b> <b>trackers</b> achieve this by moving PV panels to follow the sun. The increase can be {{by as much as}} 20% in winter and by as much as 50% in summer. Static mounted systems can be optimized by analysis of the sun path. Panels are often set to latitude tilt, an angle equal to the latitude, but performance can be improved by adjusting the angle for summer or winter. Generally, as with other semiconductor devices, temperatures above room temperature reduce the performance of photovoltaics.|$|E
