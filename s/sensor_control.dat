5000|$|A basestar's {{shape is}} that of two saucers joined to each other at their axis. The saucers are {{externally}} identical {{and some of the}} functions that they house are redundant of each other. Each saucer contains a hangar deck at its center, accessible from five large hatches distributed {{across the top of the}} cone. [...] Unlike a battlestar, a basestar's hangar is closed with a hatch when not in use. [...] All decks are connected by the Core, which allows access to any deck via a ladder.

5000|$|Robot Operating System (ROS) is a Robotics {{middleware}} (i.e. {{collection of}} software frameworks for robot software development). Even though ROS {{is not an}} operating system, it provides services designed for heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management. Running sets of ROS-based processes are represented in a graph architecture where processing takes place in nodes that may receive, post and multiplex <b>sensor,</b> <b>control,</b> state, planning, actuator and other messages. Despite the importance of reactivity and low latency in robot control, ROS, itself, is not a real-time OS (RTOS), though {{it is possible to}} integrate ROS with real-time code. [...] The lack of support for real-time systems is being addressed in the creation of ROS 2.0.|$|E
50|$|The alt-azimuth and polar-axis {{alignments}} {{are two of}} {{the three}} orientations for two-axis mounts that are, or have been, commonly used for heliostat mirrors. The third is the target-axis arrangement in which the primary axis points toward the target at which sunlight is to be reflected. The secondary axis is perpendicular to the primary one. Heliostats controlled by light-sensors have used this orientation. A small arm carries sensors that control motors that turn the arm around the two axes, so it points toward the sun. (Thus this design incorporates a solar tracker.) A simple mechanical arrangement bisects the angle between the primary axis, pointing to the target, and the arm, pointing to the sun. The mirror is mounted so its reflective surface is perpendicular to this bisector. This type of heliostat was used for daylighting prior to the availability of cheap computers, but after the initial availability of <b>sensor</b> <b>control</b> hardware.|$|E
