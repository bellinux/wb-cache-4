5|$|One of the <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> {{had been}} found in , in which Haddock is humiliated by the clairvoyant at the theatre, was removed from the story when it was being reformatted in book form.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> {{appeared}} in the storyboard and animatic were reordered or dropped altogether in {{the final version of}} the episode. Much of the Maggie subplot, for example, was modified before the episode aired. A scene in which the babies lock Ms. Sinclair in her office is missing from {{the final version of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|As {{the press}} conference had been {{broadcast}} live, within hours, thousands of people gathered at the Berlin Wall demanding that the guards open the gates. The border guards were unable to contact their superiors for instructions and, fearing a stampede, opened the gates. The iconic <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> followed– people pouring into West Berlin, standing on the Wall and attacking it with pickaxes– were broadcast worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> shows Emma {{trying to}} {{convince}} a depressed Regina to come out by talking to her through the office door is {{a reference to the}} similar <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> portrays Anna talking to Elsa through the door after their parents died in the movie Frozen.|$|R
50|$|Itoi {{claims that}} the final battle of EarthBound was {{inspired}} from his accidental childhood viewing of the Shintoho film entitled The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty. Specifically, the <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> inspired the battle was a <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> depicted a woman being raped near a river, although the scene in question depicts a murder rather than a rape.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shooting}} script was 95 pages and included a longer opening <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> was filmed, featuring Kenner's former Japanese partner Eddie Yosuto. There {{was also an}} omitted chase <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> was not shot, after the Japanese bath scene where Dolph and Brandon go after the fleeing yakuza, it ended up in an action scene set in a shopping mall.|$|R
5|$|Being an {{expansion}} to Dark Forces II, Mysteries of the Sith requires the Dark Forces II CD-ROM {{the first time}} the player starts the game. LucasArts has made improvements to the 3D engine used in Dark Forces II by including colored lighting. The full motion video cut <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> were used between levels in Dark Forces II have been replaced with cinematics rendered by the 3D engine.|$|E
5|$|During {{post-production}} Welles {{and special}} effects artist Linwood G. Dunn experimented with an optical printer to improve certain <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> Welles found unsatisfactory from the footage. Whereas Welles was often immediately pleased with Wise's work, he would require Dunn and post-production audio engineer James G. Stewart to re-do their work several times {{until he was}} satisfied.|$|E

5|$|The film {{went through}} {{post-production}} {{in the autumn}} to be finished {{in time for a}} Christmas release. Len Walter, who had edited episodes for Series One, reprised his role for Thunderbirds Are Go. The workprint of the film ran more than 15 minutes over the maximum runtime permitted by United Artists, forcing Walter to cut several minor <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> were not essential to the plot.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment {{released}} Saving Mr. Banks on Blu-ray, DVD, {{and digital}} download on March 18, 2014.

5|$|When {{some of the}} behind-the-scenes footage {{was used}} in a BET Access Granted special, some of the <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> Beyoncé was shown {{shooting}} did {{not appear in the}} finished video. Beyoncé said that the video did not turn out the way she wanted it to be and she had to reshoot most of it. In post-production, she decided that it would be more artistic to play the events in reverse.|$|E

5|$|A {{member of}} Fox's Standards and Practices {{department}} was flown {{out to the}} episode's Vancouver, British Columbia filming location. She was asked to watch the episode being produced {{to ensure that it}} did not breach any of the network's censorship rules. Several of the <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> were being produced required quite small spaces during filming, requiring Nutter to record additional coverage on a handheld camera, which he later played back to the Standards and Practices liaison for approval.|$|E
5|$|After Thelma leaves Tom, {{he begins}} showing Peter more affection, causing Lois {{to believe it}} to be strange. Peter then states that it is no {{stranger}} than when Darth Vader from the film franchise Star Wars was a parking attendant. Vader is then shown in the contemporary world as a failure, and making minimum wage. This scene, as with all <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> contain references to Star Wars or its characters, was sent to Lucasfilm for approval, in order to protect copyright. After Stewie takes over Brian's radio show, the two begin playing random sound clips from various films and television shows, including dialogue from the 1993 drama film Philadelphia, which was acknowledged as a mistake by Stewie.|$|E
5|$|At Paramount, {{the crew}} filmed all the <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> {{would take place}} on soundstages, {{including}} the Enterprise and Bird-of-Prey sets, the Paradise City interiors, and the campfire location. Production was smoother on set, and the crew shot scenes ahead of schedule. The crew fabricated a stand-in set for the God planet location, where additional scenes were filmed to combine with the location footage. Spock's catching of Kirk as the captain falls off El Capitan was filmed against a set that replicated the forest floor and was rotated ninety degrees.|$|E

5|$|Clerici {{also wrote}} several <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> {{did not make}} the film's final cut. One of which {{depicted}} a group of Ya̧nomamö cutting off the leg of a Shamatari warrior and feeding him to piranhas in the river. This scene was to take place directly after Monroe's team rescues a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from the Shamatari. Attempts were made to film this scene, but the underwater camera did not operate properly, and the piranha were difficult to control. As a result, Deodato abandoned his efforts, and still photographs taken during the scene are its only known depiction.|$|E
5|$|In the United States {{the film}} {{remained}} unseen until 1984, when Bedford Entertainment briefly released a heavily edited version {{under the title}} Unsane. It was approximately ten minutes shorter than the European release and was missing {{nearly all of the}} film's violence, which effectively rendered the numerous horror sequences incomprehensible. In addition, certain <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> established the characters and their relationships were excised, making the film's narrative difficult to follow. This version of Tenebrae received nearly unanimously negative reviews.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the film}} had been {{released}} in Czechoslovakia, Forman sought an international distributor, who informed him that the film was too short for American audiences and that it didn't have enough nudity in it; so Forman was coerced into shooting some additional <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> were never shown for domestic consumption. One of these scenes, which {{was included in the}} US version, involved a slapstick sequence in which Milda, the pianist, tries to pick up a buxom girl on the streets of Prague, only to have her trick him into entering the wrong bedroom of the four-story building in which she lives, disturbing the sleeping residents.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the scenes}} were highly praised by reviewers. The closing scene with Arya taking her first lesson from the Braavosi Syrio Forel was highlighted. Maureen Ryan from AOL TV stated {{that it was her}} {{favorite}} scene of the series so far, and James Hibberd remarked upon the quality of all the child actors of the show and stated that Maisie Williams owned her role in this episode. Other <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> were noted by the critics were the father-daughter dialogue with Eddard Stark and Arya, King Robert remembering with the members of his Kingsguard their first killings, and Eddard attending his first session of the Small Council.|$|E
5|$|The Story Mode, {{reveals the}} game's plot through battles {{interleaved}} with conversations between the player character and its enemies. It {{vary depending on}} the player's choice and performance in the battles; there is a total of 60 possible endings. The Training Mode allows the player to learn attacks by fighting a customizable CPU enemy. Two players can play in the Versus 2P, and on the Versus CPU the player fight against an AI-controlled character.

In addition, 38 training missions are unlocked as the missions are completed. The training missions are more challenging, entirely optional, and can be played separately from the campaign. One new feature in Days of Ruin is that campaign missions can now be played individually as the player completes them. Like the training missions, campaign missions can be selected {{from the main menu}} at any time.|$|E
