The study was based on the case-control component of the National Enhanced Cancer Surveillance <b>System.</b> <b>Incident</b> cases and frequency-matched population controls recruited between 1994 and 1997 from six Canadian provinces were used to estimate pancreatic cancer risks associated with exposure to CDBPs. Residence history collected from subjects was linked to two sources of water quality data to estimate historical exposure. The first source provided a lifetime average estimate of known exposure to trihalomethane (THM), bromodichloromethane (BDCM), and chloroform (TCM), while the second provided residence-specific estimates of THM exposure. Adjusted risk estimates were based on the most recent 30 years of exposure with missing data imputed using Observed Control Mean Imputation. Overall, no consistent significant increase (or decrease) in pancreatic cancer risks was observed with 30 -year exposure to THM, BDCM, and TCM after adjusting for potential confounders...|$|E
40|$|Substation {{equipment}} failure can have catastrophic {{effects on the}} power system as well as produce localised damage within the substation switchyards. Moreover, the safety of personnel can be put at great risk. In 2004, a major <b>system</b> <b>incident</b> occurred following the explosive failure of a current transformer in a transmission substation. This event resulted {{in the loss of}} generating capacity and load. Condition monitoring equipment installed in this substation failed to identify any problems associated with the current transformer prior to the event. However, a separate data recording facility installed on the current transformer secondary circuitry observed a series of current pulse trains prior to the explosion. It is proposed that these are due to the insulation degradation within the transformer. Given these observations, ten minutes of forewarning could have been provided for the event. This paper describes the design and testing procedure for a condition monitoring system used to identify similar incidents in oil/paper insulated current transformers...|$|E

40|$|Mask Projection micro Stereolithography (MPuSLA) is an {{additive}} manufacturing process {{used to build}} physical components out of a photopolymer resin. Existing MPuSLA technology cut the CAD model of part into slices by horizontal planes and the slices are stored as bitmaps. A layer corresponding {{to the shape of}} each bitmap gets cured. This layer is coated with a fresh layer of resin by lowering the Z-stage inside a vat holding the resin and the next layer is cured on top of it. In our Thick-film MPuSLA(TfMPuSLA) <b>system,</b> <b>incident</b> radiation, patterned by a dynamic mask, passes through a fixed transparent substrate to cure photopolymer resin. The existing MPuSLA fabrication models can work only for controlling the lateral dimension, without any control over the thickness of the cured part. The proposed process plan controls both the lateral dimensions and the thickness of profile of the cured part. In this thesis, a novel process planning for TfMPuSLA method is developed, to fabricate films on fixed flat substrate. The process of curing a part using this system is analytically modeled as the column cure model. It is different from the conventional process - layer cure model. Column means that a CAD model of part is discretized into vertical columns instead of being sliced into horizontal layers, and all columns get cured simultaneously till the desired heights. The process planning system is modularized into geometrical, chemical, optical, mathematical and physical modules and validated by curing test parts on our system. The thesis formulates a feasible process planning method, providing a strong basis for continued investigation of MPuSLA technology in microfabrication, such as micro lens fabrication. M. S.

As only 49 %– 75 % of HCV-infected persons in the US are aware of their infection, any chance of addressing HCV in the US is dependent upon screening to identify undiagnosed infections. Most HCV in the US consists of longstanding infections among persons born during 1945 – 1965 who are suffering escalating rates of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Mathematical modeling supports aggressive action to reach and treat these persons to minimize the subsequent burden of advanced liver disease on patients and the health care <b>system.</b> <b>Incident</b> infection is primarily among persons who inject drugs, less than 10 % {{of whom have been}} treated for HCV. Expanded screening and treatment of active persons who inject drugs raises the prospect of utilizing "treatment as prevention" to stem the tide of incident HCV infections in this population. HIV-positive {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) represent a population at risk for sexually transmitted HCV who may also benefit from adjusted screening guidelines to identify both acute and chronic infections. Prisoners also represent a critical population for aggressive screening and treatment. Finally, the two-stage testing algorithm for HCV diagnosis is problematic and difficult for patients and providers to navigate. While emerging therapeutics raise the prospect of reducing HCV-related morbidity and mortality, as well as eliminating new infections, major barriers remain with regard to identifying infections, improving access to treatment, and ensuring payer coverage of costly new therapeutic regimens.

40|$|The {{detection}} of incidents {{and the subsequent}} incident response activities and traffic management activities have long been known {{to have a significant}} impact on the resultant magnitude of incident induced delay. Efforts to reduce incident induced delay have tended to focus on reducing the time to detect incidents (i. e. automatic incident detection) and to provide appropriate and swift emergency response. However, efforts to develop traffic management strategies in response to incidents are often hampered by a lack of knowledge of how long the incident is likely to exist. This lack of knowledge also is problematic for disseminating information to travellers about the incident. In practice, traffic management personnel, police, etc. are able to provide rough estimates of the duration of incidents on the basis of experience and the known characteristics of the crash (e. g. number of vehicles involved, type of vehicles, etc.). The purpose of this work is to examine the feasibility of developing a model that permits the prediction of crash duration on the basis of observable crash characteristics. Such a model could be integrated within the traffic management centre (TMC) software to assist operators in selecting appropriate traffic management response strategies and in the provision of information to drivers. The examination of the potential to develop a crash duration prediction model is done on the basis of field data for an urban freeway (the QEW) in Toronto Canada. Field data are obtained from two unrelated databases: the provincial 2 crash database and the freeway traffic management <b>system</b> <b>incident</b> log database. It is found that linking these databases is a complex problem that has a significant influence on the explanatory power of the crash duration prediction model...|$|E
