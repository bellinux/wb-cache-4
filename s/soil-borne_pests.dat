40|$|Biofumigation {{is based}} on the use of glucosinolate-containing plants for the control of <b>soil-borne</b> <b>pest</b> and diseases. Upon tissue damage, glucosinolates are hydrolyzed by {{endogenous}} enzymes (myrosinase) and a range of biologically active compounds are formed. Isothiocyanates (ITCs) are the quantitatively dominating products formed at neutral pH. Most of these compounds are volatile and only sparingly soluble in aqueous systems, and depending on the R-group structure and the presence of nucleophiles, further transformation of ITCs occurs. At lower pH and in the presence of certain molecules able to deliver two redox equivalents, the proportion of nitriles increases at the expense of ITC. The effect of ascorbic acid and glutathione on the production of nitriles at pH 5 was investigated by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC). The presence of 0. 25 µmol ascorbic acid increased the production of nitriles although at higher concentrations the proportion of nitriles decreased. Increasing amounts of GSH favored the production of nitriles (40...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{incorporation}} of Brassicaceae plant residues is a pest management approach utilized {{with the aim}} of attaining the release of allelochemicals that are biologically active, a phenomenon termed biofumigation (1). Brassicaceae residues contain glucosinolates that yield isothiocyanates (ITC), and other biologically active compounds, when hydrolyzed by the enzyme myrosinase. In addition to biofumigation, depending upon the target organism, pest control attained in response to Brassica residue amendments has been attributed to altered soil biology (2, 3, 4) at times acting through the modulation of host defense responses (5). Although the majority of studies have focused on use of Brassica green manures in the application of a biofumigant material, the use of seed meals, a by-product of the commercial food and industrial oil extraction process, is emerging as a more efficient and effective alternative application strategy. Effective use of Brassicaceae seed meals for <b>soil-borne</b> <b>pest</b> control is dependent upon a variety of factors that vary with the operative mode of action.

30|$|Soil {{fumigation}} is {{an effective}} method to control soil-borne plant pathogens and soil is generally fumigated with chemicals before planting high-value cash crops. Although <b>soil-borne</b> <b>pests</b> were historically managed by methyl bromide (MeBr) fumigation, it has been banned due to its {{detrimental effects on the}} stratospheric ozone layer (Prather et al. 1984; Ristaino and Thomas 1997). MeBr is being phased out as it is still in limited use around the world. Chloropicrin (CP) as an alternative of MeBr has been widely used for soil fumigation in many countries of the world (Ibekwe et al. 2004; Takeuchi 2006). Since chemical fumigants are known to have broad biocidal activities in addition to pathogen control (Anderson 1993), many general soil microbes may also be affected according to their sensitivity to the chemicals. In contrast, biological soil disinfestation (BSD), mainly developed in the Netherlands (Blok et al. 2000) and Japan (Shinmura 2004) in organic agriculture, suppresses soil pathogens based on microbial activity on incorporated plant biomass under anaerobic conditions without using any chemical fumigants. BSD has attracted our interest as an environmentally friendly tool and a suitable alternative to chemical fumigation as well as other non-chemical methods for soil-borne disease management. The principles of BSD conducted in Japan include three steps: (1) incorporating plant biomass into the soil, (2) flooding the soil by irrigation, and (3) covering the soil surface with plastic films for about three weeks to induce reducing soil conditions (Shinmura 2000, 2004). The total process is completed within one month and crops can be planted after removing the plastic film and plowing the fields. Plant biomass sources such as Brassica spp., wheat bran, rice straw, rice bran, Avena spp., grasses, or other organic substances have been incorporated in BSD against <b>soil-borne</b> <b>pests</b> and diseases (Shinmura 2004; Goud et al. 2004; Momma 2008).|$|E
40|$|Background: Resistant cultivars are key {{elements}} for pathogen control and pesticide reduction, but their repeated use {{may lead to}} the emergence of virulent pathogen populations, able to overcome the resistance. Increased research efforts, mainly based on theoretical studies, explore spatio-temporal deployment strategies of resistance genes in order to maximize their durability. We evaluated experimentally three of these strategies to control root-knot nematodes: cultivar mixtures, alternating and pyramiding resistance genes, under controlled and field conditions over a 3 -years period, assessing the efficiency and the durability of resistance in a protected crop rotation system with pepper as summer crop and lettuce as winter crop. Results: The choice of the resistance gene and the genetic background in which it is introgressed, affected the frequency of resistance breakdown. The pyramiding of two different resistance genes in one genotype suppressed the emergence of virulent isolates. Alternating different resistance genes in rotation was also efficient to decrease virulent populations in fields due to the specificity of the virulence and the trapping effect of resistant plants. Mixing resistant cultivars together appeared as a less efficient strategy to control nematodes. Conclusions: This work provides experimental evidence that, in a cropping system with seasonal sequences of vegetable species, pyramiding or alternating resistance genes benefit yields in the long-term by increasing the durability of resistant cultivars and improving the long-term control of a <b>soil-borne</b> <b>pest.</b> To our knowledge, this result is the first one obtained for a plant-nematode interaction, which helps demonstrate the general applicability of such strategies for breeding and sustainable management of resistant cultivars against pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Impacts of {{sustainable}} <b>soil-borne</b> <b>pest</b> management strategies {{on the soil}} ecosystem were {{compared to that of}} methyl bromide fumi-gation using nematode community analysis. A field experiment was conducted in 2003 and re-peated in 2004. Soil treatments carried out in summer months included methyl bromide (MB) fumigation, solarization (S) for 6 weeks, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) cover cropping for 3 months (CP), combination of solarization and cowpea cover cropping (S + CP), and a weedy fallow throughout the summer used as a control (C). All treated plots were planted to pepper (Capsicum annuum) after the application of the treatments {{at the end of the}} summer. In general, responses of nematode communities to soil treatments were more obvious at pepper planting than at 4 months after planting. In 2003, initial population densities of bacterivores and fungivores at pepper planting followed a hypothesized pattern of MB> S> S + CP> CP> C. However, this perturbation did not persist after a cycle of vigorous growth of a pepper crop. Omnivorous nematodes were the most sensitive nematode trophic group, with im-pact from soil treatment lasting until the end of the pepper crop. Nematode community indices such as ratio of fungivores to fungivores plus bacterivores, richness, and structure index were especially useful in detecting impacts by the var-ious soil treatments. While disturbance from MB on the nematode communities lasted at least until the end of the pepper crop, that from the solari-zation often reduced or disappeared at the end of the experiment. The CP treatment enhanced many of the beneficial nematodes but failed to suppress the final population densities of herbiv-orous nematodes at pepper harvest (Pf). How-ever, CP + S consistently reduced the Pf of herbivores to levels equivalent to MB in both years, whereas, this level of suppression could not be achieved by either CP or solarization alone...|$|R

40|$|Cropping {{systems in}} in-soil {{protected}} cultivation are often very intensive and {{are characterized by}} a very low number of crops in the rotation. They are therefore very fragile with respect to <b>soil-borne</b> <b>pests</b> and diseases, and depend on pesticides. These cropping systems must be redesigned to exploit pesticide free techniques to control these <b>soil-borne</b> <b>pests</b> and diseases. Because these techniques (soil solarisation, chosen intercrop or manure, biofumigation, tolerant cultivars…) are not totally effective, they must be combined to add their effects. Although these techniques are described in the R&D literature, few systems approaches are available to describe their combined effects. Part of this knowledge, though, is held by advisers and growers combining these techniques on farm. Building on the hypothesis that this local knowledge can be combined to the available scientific literature, we design a multicriteria tool to evaluate the properties of candidates cropping systems in in-soil protected cultivation. The properties that are qualified deal with the resilience of the cropping system {{with respect to the}} main occurring pests and diseases, and with the environmental impact of the cropping system, taking into account several pests at once. Because the knowledge of the growers and advisers is more qualitative than quantitative, we have chosen a qualitative multicriteria approach. We present here the knowledge and evaluation tree built in the specific case of in-soil protected cultivation cropping systems common in Southeast France, cropping systems based on winter salad crops (from 1 to 3 successive crops) associated to a spring cash crop (melon, cucumber, eggplant…).

Two factors that can affect survival of larval D. v. virgifera are natural populations of soil-dwelling entomopathogens and transgenic corn, Zea mays L., expressing genes from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt). During the fall of 2008 and 2009, we measured incidence of entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes in corn fields that displayed a high abundance of D. v. virgifera by exposing three insect species: D. v. virgifera, Tenebrio molitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and Galleria mellonella L. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) to field soil. Entomopathogenic activity of select field isolated nematode strains and fungal isolates was tested in follow up laboratory bioassays. We conducted laboratory, greenhouse and field experiments {{to examine the effects}} of Bt corn (producing Cry 34 Ab 1 / 35 Ab 1) and isoline (non-Bt) corn on behavior, survival, and development of larval D. v. virgifera. We also tested effects of soil entomopathogens on D. v. virgifera development in the presence of Bt and isoline corn. We report a high prevalence of naturally occurring entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae in corn fields and nematodes were present, but at lower abundance than fungi. Of the entomopathogens observed, M. anisopliae appears to have the greatest potential to control D. v. virgifera in temperate cornfields, as follow up bioassays showed that select field isolates were more efficacious against D. v. virgifera larvae than a standard commercial isolate. Results from laboratory feeding experiments indicated that larvae prefer to feed on isoline corn more than Bt corn. In a greenhouse experiment, larval survival at 17 days did not differ significantly among isoline corn, Bt corn and a blend of the two. However, larval development was hindered on Bt corn compared to either isoline or a blend. Additionally, later instar larvae on isoline corn had lower survival at high concentrations of entomopathogenic nematodes. In a field experiment that tested larval survival and movement, the number of larvae recovered was higher from isoline than from Bt corn, and recovery decreased as distance from the infested plant increased. These data suggest that Bt corn influences larval movement and development, which can influence the efficacy of entomopathogens against D. v. virgifera larvae...|$|R

The organic wastes were applied either to Calcic Entisol or Haplic Arenosol moistened at field capacity and soil was covered with polyethylene sheet for 28 - 30 days to retain the volatiles. The PFW-treated soil mainly released volatile terpene hydrocarbons (trans-caryophyllene, â-myrcene and p-cymene), with a-humulene and ethylbenzotriazole prevailing in the untreated soil. After SBV application mainly alkyl compounds and alkylbenzenes were released, whereas cyclohexanone, limonene, butanone, acetic acid, camphor and benzaldehyde occurred in the untreated soil.

In this study agricultural soil samples, containing a range of important <b>soil-borne</b> <b>pests</b> and pathogens, were treated with steam in a specially designed laboratory steam-rig.   It was found that treatment at 60 °C, for a duration of only 3 minutes plus eight minutes ‘resting’ (“low-temperature/short duration soil steaming”) was enough to 100 % kill soil-borne fungal pathogens Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Sclerotium cepivorum, Verticillium dahlia e and Pythium ultimum;  potato cyst nematodes Globodera rostochiensis and Globodera pallida, and weeds Chenopodium album and Agropyron repens. When low temperature/short duration soil steaming was compared with a chemical soil disinfectant, using the fumigant dazomet (Basamid) at a rate of 760 kg/ha, both disinfestation methods resulted in 100 % elimination of the above pathogens, nematodes and weeds and caused IGR (Increased Growth Response) of lettuce plants. In a further study, using four different soil types at three different matric potentials, it was found that efficacy of low-temperature/short duration steaming is dependent on soil type and soil moisture content, and that treatment of soil in a moist state is more effective than treatment in a dry state, especially when treating fine-textured sand and loam soils.

Although most of these trials show tree growth and yield benefits of fallow periods and alternative fumigants, {{it is important to}} assess the economic costs and benefits of the various treatments. In this report, we present a preliminary economic analysis of several methyl bromide alternatives for peach and plum orchard replant in California. The yield data summaries are for peach, plum and pluot orchard trials carried out in the San Joaquin Valley on replanted orchard soil with no identified plant parasitic nematodes. Trial methods, treatments, and measurements are given in last year’s proceedings (Trout et al., 2003). Economic Analysis The economic analysis is based on costs of production and yields provided by UC Cooperative Extension personnel that specialize in tree fruit crops and compiled by the Dept. of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California a...|$|R
40|$|Minnesota ranked fourth {{nationally in}} the {{production}} of dry edible beans during the 2000 growing season, with 150, 000 acres harvested. Dry edible beans (mostly navy and pinto) provide a relatively consistent source of income, and an excellent fit within the crop rotation systems of this area, typically small grains and corn. In 2000, total value of production was estimated at $ 42. 7 million. In addition to the direct value of this crop to growers in the central and northwest regions of our state, the crop provides to the processing industry, snap bean contracts between processors and growers assist in adding economic diversification for traditional corn and soybean growers in southern and west-central Minnesota. The high value of this crop, along with the potential for economic losses from insect, disease and weed pests, continue to create demand for effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs. In response to new IPM information needs generated by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), this profile was developed to a) summarize current IPM practices for insect, disease and weed pests, b) highlight pesticides under review by US-EPA, c) estimate the impact of the loss of selected pesticides, and d) assess alternatives for such losses. Insect Pests: Insect pests are usually the most damaging and difficult pests to control in dry edible beans, affecting either bean quality or yield. The most important insect pests include seed corn maggot and the potato leafhopper. Seed corn maggot (SCM), and other <b>soil-borne</b> insect <b>pests</b> such as white grubs and wireworms, can do considerable damage, resulting in uneven plant stands, and/or by causing delayed maturity. Potato leafhopper (PLH), if left unchecked will also caus...|$|R
40|$|Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an {{organophosphate}} insecticide {{used primarily}} to control foliage and <b>soil-borne</b> insect <b>pests</b> {{on a variety}} of food and feed crops. In mammals, maternal exposure to CPF has been reported to induce dose-related abnormalities such as slower brain growth and cerebral cortex thinning. In lower vertebrates, for example, fish and amphibians, teratogenic activity of this compound is correlated with several anatomical alterations. Little is known about the effects of CPF on mRNA expression of genes involved in early development of the anatomical structures appearing abnormal in embryos. This study investigated the effects of exposure to different CPF concentrations (10, 15 and 20 mg/L) on Xenopus laevis embryos from stage 4 / 8 to stage 46. Some of the morphological changes we detected in CPF-exposed embryos included cranial neural crest cell (NCC) -derived structures. For this reason, we analyzed the expression of select genes involved in hindbrain patterning (egr 2), cranial neural crest chondrogenesis, and craniofacial development (fgf 8, bmp 4, sox 9, hoxa 2 and hoxb 2). We found that CPF exposure induced a reduction in transcription of all the genes involved in NCC-dependent chondrogenesis, with largest reductions in fgf 8 and sox 9; whereas, in hindbrain, we did not find any alterations in egr 2 expression. Changes in the expression of fgf 8, bmp 4, and sox 9, which are master regulators of several developmental pathways, have important implications. If these changes are confirmed to belong to a general pattern of alterations in vertebrates prenatally exposed to OP, they might be useful to assess damage during vertebrate embryo development.

30|$|Soil {{fumigants}} {{are used}} extensively to control <b>soil-borne</b> <b>pests</b> including nematodes, pathogens, and weeds, so that increasing the yields of many crops (Mao et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014; Ibekwe 2004). For instance, bacterial wilt on ginger, {{caused by the}} soil-borne bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, is a major disease responsible for enormous yield losses (Yang et al. 2012). Without soil fumigation, it can cause an 80 % crop failure in ginger (Li et al. 2014). Therefore, {{in order to ensure}} a better crop yield and provide greater benefits to farmers, soil fumigation has become an important global agricultural practice (Ajwa et al. 2010). Methyl bromide (MB) is mainly used for pre-planting fumigation of vegetables to manage many kinds of phytopathogenic organisms including R. solanacearum (Paret et al. 2010). However, MB had been phased out in developing countries owing to its detrimental effects on the stratospheric ozone layer (Bell et al. 2000). Chloropicrin is a potential replacement for MB, which has been widely used to control ginger bacterial wilt in China (Mao et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|Management {{practices}} that maintain soil health {{are becoming increasingly}} popular, and non-chemical alternatives to methyl bromide are gradually being pursued. Objectives of this research were to examine effects of non-chemical pest management strategies on several key <b>soil-borne</b> <b>pests</b> and beneficial soil organisms, and to compare these treatments with methyl bromide fumigation. A field experiment was conducted in 2003 and 2004. Soil treatments carried out in summer months included methyl bromide (MB) fumigation, solarization on raised bed (SB) and flat bed (SF) for 6 weeks, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) cover cropping for 3 months (CP), combination of raised bed solarization and cowpea cover cropping (SCP), and a weed fallow throughout the summer as a control (C). At termination of summer treatment, all treated plots were planted to pepper (Capsicum annuum) under metalized mulch with drip irrigation. In both years, cowpea or solarization treatments alone were not as effective as methyl bromide for root-knot nematode suppression {{at the end of}} the pepper crop. However, the combination of solarization and cowpea cover crop matched the root-knot nematode suppression performance of methyl bromide fumigation, and suppressed the populatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of biochar vary with pyrolysis temperature. Chloropicrin (CP) {{is an effective}} fumigant for controlling <b>soil-borne</b> <b>pests.</b> This study investigated the {{characteristics of}} biochars prepared at 300, 500, and 700 °C by michelia alba (Magnolia denudata) wood and evaluated their capacity to adsorb CP. The study also determined the potential influence of biochar, which was added to sterilized and unsterilized soils at rates of 0 %, 1 %, 5 %, and 100 %, on CP degradation. The specific surface area, pore volume, and micropores increased considerably {{with an increase in}} the pyrolytic temperature. The adsorption rate of biochar for CP increased with increasing pyrolytic temperature. The maximum adsorption amounts of CP were similar for the three biochars. Next, the study examined the degradation ability of the biochar for CP. The degradation rate constant (k) of CP increased when biochar was added to the soil, and k increased with increased amendment rate and pyrolysis temperature. The results indicate that biochar can accelerate CP degradation in soil. The findings will be instructive in using biochar as a new fertilizer in fumigating soil with CP...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} batch and fed-batch mass {{production}} of Steinernema carpocapsae. S. carpocapsae is an entomoparasitic nematode that {{is used as a}} biological control agent of <b>soil-borne</b> crop insect <b>pests.</b> The ability and efficiency of fed-batch culture process was successful through the utilization of the nematode’s bacterial symbiont Xenorhabdus nematophila. Results from the fed-batch process were compared to those obtain from the standard batch process. The fed-batch process successively improved the mass production process of S. carpocapsae employing liquid medium technology. Within {{the first week of the}} fed-batch process (day six), the nematode density obtained was 202, 000 nematodes mL − 1; whereas on day six, batch culture mode resulted in a nematode density of 23, 000 nematodes mL − 1. The fed-batch process was superior to that of batch production with a yield approximately 8. 8 -fold higher. In fed-batch process, the nematode yield was improved 88. 6 % higher within a short amount of time compared to the batch process. Fed-batch seems to make the process more efficient and possibly economically viable. </p...|$|R
40|$|Soilless {{culture is}} a plant growing {{techniques}} without traditional agricultural soil. In the early 1960 s it was used in Europe for the first time. Soil salinity, poor soil, <b>soil-borne</b> diseases and <b>pests,</b> water shortage, etc. are reasons for making the soilless culture. This technique can be divided in two main groups: Substrate culture and Hydroponics (liquid) culture. Substrate cultures consist of two groups including the organic and inorganic. Organic substrates (non inert medium) are peat, coco peat, bark, burn rice husks, etc. Rockwool, glasswool, perlite, pumice and volcanic tuff, etc. are also inorganic substrates (inert medium). In hydroponics culture, plants are directly grown in nutrient solution. The most common inert growing medium is rockwool, very popular in Northern Europe, especially in Holland, Poland, Ukraine, Scandinavia and Russia, but also South Korea and Japan. In Holland the cultivation of roses on rockwool represents 80 % of the total soilless cultivation. Among the organic growing medium, coco peat is currently the most common in rose cultivation. It can be used alone, or mixed wit...|$|R
40|$|When {{peach and}} several other types of fruit and nut trees are replanted after a {{previous}} orchard is removed, the trees often grow slowly and erratically. Growers have learned that fumigation with methyl bromide (MeBr) reduces this “replant disorder ” and the new trees are more vigorous and uniform. The causes of replant disorder have not been identified but are believed to result from a complex of major and minor <b>soil-borne</b> plant <b>pests</b> whose populations evolved with the previous orchard. We are pursuing chemical and non-chemical strategies that reduce the replant problem in peach and plum. Another paper in these proceedings (Schneider, et al. 2003) describes similar work in grapes, and Browne et al. (2003) discusses diagnosis of the replant disease. In this report, we describe the effects of fallowing and drip irrigation-applied fumigants on nematode populations, tree growth, and yield. These field plot studies are located at the USDA-ARS San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences Center near Parlier, CA in fields with sandy-loam soils and long histories of orchards but no identified acute pathogen problems. This is an update of four field studies reported at last year’s Conference (Trout, et al. 2002). The studies involve fallowing land between removing the previous tree crop and planting the new orchard, and testing alternative fumigants applied by drip irrigation. All studies included a standard methyl bromide shanked, tarped application and a non-treated control. Field plots were typically 3 tree rows by 3 or 4 trees and were randomized within 4 replicated blocks. Plant growth was evaluated by measuring trunk diameters, and yields were measured in producing trees (3 rd through 5 th year). More details of the methods are given in the 200...|$|R
