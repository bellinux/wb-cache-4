50|$|A {{weakened}} Pakistan without Inzamam-ul-Haq (banned), Shoaib Malik (banned) and Yousuf Youhana (a sick father) {{went in with}} a bat-heavy team, {{with five}} pure batsmen and two all-rounders plus the wicketkeeper against a West Indies team who could field a first-choice eleven - only lacking all-rounder Dwayne Bravo. Nevertheless, Pakistan went in as favourites in most people's eyes, only {{to go down in}} spectacular fashion. The West Indians won the toss, and chose to bat first, nearly regretting it as they lost an out-of-form Chris Gayle early on as he was caught in close by Abdul Razzaq off Shabbir Ahmed. Three overs later, Devon Smith - West Indies' other opener - was let off by Test debutant Bazid Khan who fielded at second slip, as he couldn't react to a ball that came towards his stomach. However, Bazid Khan kept his nerve a bit later when he held an edge from the man at the other end, Ramnaresh Sarwan, who was outdone by an away-swinger from Shabbir Ahmed, reducing West Indies to 25 for 2. After a bit of a steady period, where Brian Lara in particular looked in control of the bowlers, another catch went to slip as Yasir Hameed could take the edge off Devon Smith's bat for 19. At lunch, however, Lara (44*) and Chanderpaul (14*) had restored some honour for the West Indies, lifting them to 102 for 3 on what looked like a fast outfield. The two continued after tea, Shabbir Ahmed sending down a particularly poor over with three no-balls, three boundaries and a run four, and Brian Lara eventually raced to a magnificent 130 off 120 balls, with 16 fours and four sixes before being bowled attempting a cover drive. Down the order, Wavell Hinds contributed with 28, wicketkeeper Courtney Browne made 12, and Daren Powell made 10, but Pakistan also served <b>up</b> 24 no-balls <b>to</b> help the West Indian cause. Two wickets with four balls - Powell and Chanderpaul (caught at cover for 92) marked the end of the West Indian fight-back, however, in what <b>shaped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an excellent game of Test cricket. With King and Edwards both gone for 3, West Indies were all out for 345.|$|R
40|$|The current {{subprime}} {{financial crisis}} has <b>shaped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{one of the}} most dramatic and impactful events in the past few decades. No one particular factor fully accounts for why the American economy suffered setbacks unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930 s. Some of the roots of the current financial crisis started taking hold in 1999 when Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act, also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Gramm-Leach-Bliley brought about sweeping deregulation to the financial services industry. In essence, Gramm -Leach-Bliley swept away almost six decades of financial services regulation precipitated by the Great Depression of the 1930 s. Gram m-Leach-Bliley explicitly repealed the Glass-Steagall Act passed in the 1930 s to stamp out much of the evil that caused the Great Depression. The year 2009 is a momentous year: it marks the ten-year anniversary of the passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. This article posits that passage of the Gramm -Leach-Bliley Act in 1999, the Republican push for deregulation, and-most importantly repeal of the firewalls established by the Glass-Steagall Act accounts for why America is in the midst of one of the worst and deepest financial crises in our nation 2 ̆ 7 s history. This article examines the Senate debates leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Interestingly, a number of politicians issued powerful criticisms, predictions, and forecasts around the time of the passage of Gramm-Leach-Bliley that should have been taken seriously. Most notably, Senators Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Russell Feingold (D-WI), and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) stood out as vocal critics. To gain further insight into the reach and effect of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, this article examines the deregulatory effect of the legislation on two corporations in particular: Citigroup and Bank of America. This article then examines whether firewalls are necessary in the financial services industry. As the Troubled Asset Relief Program (2 ̆ 2 TARP 2 ̆ 2) has demonstrated, some institutions are 2 ̆ 2 too big to fail. 2 ̆ 2 This article explores what a return to Glass-Steagall regulation would do to prevent the 2 ̆ 2 too big to fail 2 ̆ 2 problem. Alternatively, it explores a three-tiered approach to financial services industry regulation. Finally, it explores whether we should let financial service industry institutions fail from a market efficiency standpoint, in the absence of strong regulation in the form of firewalls or stringent regulatory oversight...|$|R

40|$|The {{method of}} domain {{perturbations}} <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> study {{the problem of}} a nearly spherical bubble in an inviscid, axisymmetric straining flow. Steady-state shapes and axisymmetric oscillatory motions are considered. The steady-state solutions suggest {{the existence of a}} limit point at a critical Weber number, beyond which no solution exists on the steady-state solution branch which includes the spherical equilibrium state in the absence of flow (e. g. the critical value of 1. 73 is estimated from the third-order solution). In addition, the first-order steady-state shape exhibits a maximum radius at θ = 1 / 6 π which clearly indicates the barrel-like shape that was found earlier via numerical finite-deformation theories for higher Weber numbers. The oscillatory motion of a nearly spherical bubble is considered in two different ways. First, a small perturbation to a spherical base state is studied with the ad hoc assumption that the steady-state shape is spherical for the complete Weber-number range of interest. This analysis shows that the frequency of oscillation decreases as Weber number increases, and that a spherical bubble shape is unstable if Weber number is larger than 4. 62. Secondly, the correct steady-state <b>shape</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> O(W) <b>is</b> included <b>to</b> obtain a rigorous asymptotic formula for the frequency change at small Weber number. This asymptotic analysis also shows that the frequency decreases as Weber number increases; for example, {{in the case of the}} principal mode (n = 2), ω^ 2 = ω_ 0 ^ 0 (1 − 0. 31 W), where ω_ 0 is the oscillation frequency of a bubble in a quiescent fluid...|$|R

30|$|As {{more and}} more types and sizes of forging gears are needed, the {{accuracy}} of billet volume plays an extremely important role in fully filling the die cavity during the cold precision forging of spur gear (Balendra and Qin 2000; Abrinia and Makaremi 2008). In order to obtain the complete filling of the die cavity form, the billet <b>is</b> supposed <b>to</b> have the exact volume needed for the finished part (Behrens et al. 2007). The change of billet volume will affect dimensional accuracy of the gear as is demonstrated by Xu and Chi (2000).

Reference circle method is a traditional method to calculate the billet volume, which is not taken into account the clearances between the working teeth and tooth modification factors. Three-dimensional solid modeling is an accurate and feasible method to obtain the billet volume (Jin et al. 2012), but it is extremely complicated and will cost long modeling time. Choi et al.

According to Rattner, while the Democrats economic strategy remained largely based on Keynes, the economist's name was now rarely mentioned; [...] "Keynes" [...] had become an almost politically toxic word due to the extensive criticism of the 2009 Keynesian stimulus. Rattner refers to the work of Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi, which determined that the 2009 US stimulus saved about 8.5 million jobs, and with Obama's [...] third stimulus, a $450 billion Jobs plan was projected to create 1.9 million jobs in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|... 3:10 to Yuma was {{originally}} slated for an October 5, 2007 release, but Lionsgate moved the film's release {{a month earlier}} to September 7, 2007 to beat competing Western films The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and No Country for Old Men. [...] As {{a result of the}} move, the studio was not able to use the Toronto International Film Festival as a platform for the film's release, but it was released before a cluster of films similarly vying for awards. [...] According to Lionsgate president Tom Ortenberg, [...] "In what is <b>shaping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a very impressive and crowded field of upscale commercial motion pictures this fall, we wanted {{to be one of the}} first ones out, so that everything else will be measured against us." [...] The earlier theatrical run positioned it for a prominent high-definition Blu-ray Disc and DVD release in the first week of January, during awards seasons. [...] Lionsgate similarly planned this strategy for Crash (2004), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year.|$|E
