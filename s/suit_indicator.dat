40|$|Abstract. Important {{groups of}} {{microbes}} were investigated in three hard coal mining dumps in Saxonia / Germany. In the particular dumps, different chemophysical and geochemical conditions are existing, {{depending on the}} kind of remediation up to six decades ago. Thiobacillus denitrificans, iron and sulfate reducers, and general aerobic heterotrophs and fungi were counted by MPN and CFU methods. Samples were taken from drilling cores in different depths out of the dumps, from seepage-, surface- and ground waters and from sediments. Similarities and {{significant differences were found between}} the microbial populations of the three dumps, depending on the appropriate environmental conditions. As a result, enhanced counts of T. denitrificans were detected at all three sites, originating from fertilizers (agricul-ture, gardens) and atmospheric precipitations.

40|$|This study uses a 20 -year {{time series}} of {{standardized}} bottom trawl winter survey data (1994 - 2013) from the Barents Sea, {{to investigate the}} changes in abundance and distributional range of Norway pout (Trisopterus esmarkii) in response to changing sea temperatures. Due to the boreal Norway pout’s rather limited geographical distribution in the Barents Sea, and that Norway pout suffers no targeted fishing mortality in the Barents Sea, the species may be a well <b>suited</b> <b>indicator</b> species of climate and ecosystem change here. Annual Norway pout abundance indices were adjusted for diel changes in catchability, and an evident increase in Norway pout abundance was found during the study period, although a marked decrease {{the last two years}} was also evident. The distributional range was also found to increase, especially northwards from the distinct core area in the southwestern part of the Barents Sea. Although a rather weak correlation was found when comparing annual Norway pout abundance indices with annual corresponding sea temperatures (r = 0. 32), stronger correlations were found when abundance indices were compared to sea temperatures which were measured two (r = 0. 67) and three years (r = 0. 72) in advance. Reasons for these rather strong lagged (delayed) correlations are briefly being discussed in this thesis, and may be related to temperature effects on recruitment, maternal conditions (e. g. fecundity), changes in abundance/distribution of other species which affect Norway pout abundance (prey, predators or competitors), and/or a gradual expansion due to increased suitable habitat...|$|R

A secondary forest was included to obtain natural reference values. On the organic farms, soil fertility is maintained mainly with composted organic matter in contrast to conventional farmers who combine fresh manure and chemical fertilizers, and typically apply large amounts of pesticides. Parameters measured were dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, acid phosphomonoesterase and β-glucosaminidase activity, microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial community composition by phospholipid fatty acid analysis. A strong negative impact of intensive chemical fertilizer and pesticide use on soil enzyme activities was demonstrated. Dehydrogenase and β-glucosidase activities were correlated with soil organic matter content and pH. β-glucosidase activity under organic management approached that under forest, while MBC and dehydrogenase activity remained higher under forest. The composition of the soil microbial community strongly differed between forest and cultivated soil, a clear difference in composition was also observed between conventional and organic farming.

40|$|The {{capacity}} to communicate effectively with other individuals plays {{a critical role}} in the daily life of an individual and can have important fitness consequences. Animals rely on a number of visual and non-visual signals, whose production brings costs to the individual. The theory of honest signaling states that these costs are higher for low than for high-quality individuals, which prevents cheating and makes signals, such as skin and plumage colouration, indicators of individual’s quality or condition. The condition-dependent nature of signals makes them ideally <b>suited</b> as <b>indicators</b> of environmental quality, implying that signal production might be affected by contaminants. In this mini-review article, we have made the point that oxidative stress (OS) is one overlooked mechanism linking exposure to contaminants to signaling because (i) many contaminants can influence the individual’s oxidative balance, and (ii) generation of both visual and non-visual signals is sensitive to oxidative stress. To this end, we have provided the first comprehensive review on the way both non-organic (heavy metals, especially mercury) and organic (persistent organic pollutants) contaminants may influence either OS or sexual signaling. We have also paid special attention to emerging classes of pollutants like brominated flame-retardants and perfluoroalkoxy alkanes in order to stimulate research in this area.

40|$|Abstract: The {{response}} of soil biogeochemical properties to external nutrient loading {{may serve as}} sensitive indicators of eutrophication in wetland ecosystems. We investigated the effects of nutrient loading {{on the distribution of}} soil C, N and P in four wetlands of the Florida Everglades: Water Conservation Area (WCA) - 1, WCA- 2 a, WCA- 3 a and Taylor Slough. The nutrient-impacted zones extended from water-inflow points into interior areas and varied greatly between wetlands, from 0. 5 km in WCA- 1, 7 km in WCA- 2 a, 3 km in WCA- 3 a and 12 km in Taylor Slough. Nutrient loading effects on soil properties were similar among all wetlands regardless of background nutrient levels. Total P levels in oligotrophic areas varied considerably, from 205 to 1 1 619 mg kg for floc and from 200 to 553 mg kg for soil (0 - 3 cm). Floc had greater assimilative capacity for P than underlying soil. Assessment of the impacts of eutrophication indicated that P-related parameters were best <b>suited</b> as <b>indicators.</b> The most sensitive indicator with the greatest response to nutrient loading was NaHCO 3 -Pi (labile P). Labile P was 1973 % greater in floc and 727 % greater in soil for impacted compared to oligotrophic areas. Soil C and N properties were more indirectly related to nutrient loading through the influence of plant production and organic matter dynamics. Delineation of impacted and oligotrophic wetland areas in the Everglades ecosystem may serve as a baseline to assess future responses of biogeochemical properties to eutrophication...|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{was made}} of 3, 923 records of 162 wild Passiflora {{specimens}} to assess the distribution of their diversity in Colombia, identify collection gaps, and explore their potential as indicator species. Despite variable collecting density among and within biogeographic regions, the Andean region clearly presents a higher species richness, particularly in the central coffee growing zone and the departments of Antioquia, Cundinamarca and Valle del Cauca. The elevational distribution of diversity shows a small peak below 500 m, and two higher ones between 1, 000 - 2, 000 and 2, 500 - 3, 000 m. This pattern corresponds to divergent adaptive trends among infrageneric divisions. The analysis on 19 climatic variables showed that the two principal variance components, explaining 77 percent of the total, are respectively associated with temperature and precipitation, without influence of seasonality. Distribution parameters allow recognizing more than 36 narrow endemics. Prediction of species distribution showed nine areas with very high richness (predicted sympatry of 41 to 54 species) in the Andean region, three of which correspond to collection gaps. Endemics were not particularly frequent there, so a prioritization of protected areas based on species richness would not favor their conservation. The sites with high Passiflora diversity are poorly represented in {{the current system of}} protected areas. Instead, their striking correspondence with ecotopes of the coffee growing zone imposes a conservation strategy integrating agricultural and environmental management at the landscape level. Reciprocally, several traits of Passiflora species make them particularly <b>suited</b> as <b>indicators</b> for any effort of conservation or restoration in this region of importance for the country.

30|$|However, these {{indicators}} {{have also}} been criticized for several reasons. First, indicators of objective career success have to be adapted to changing organizational and labor-market conditions.

Second, salary is differentially <b>suited</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of objective success in different fields of employment (Dette et  al. 2004).

Fourth, objective career success criteria have often been developed with respect to employees with high potential like professionals, managers, and so called “white-collar” workers. Objective success criteria with respect to less educated “blue-collar” workers are less well developed. These might relate to, for instance, being employed or not, being paid such that one can live on it or not, having the chance to leave a temporary employment in favor of a permanent employment, etc. Finally, it may be generally questioned whether salary is an indicator of objective success or whether performance-related achievements are more suited as measures of objective success.|$|R
40|$|Since {{complete}} {{testing is}} not possible, testers {{have to focus}} their effort on {{those parts of the}} software which they expect to have defects, the test foci. Despite the crucial importance of a systematic and justified definition of the test foci, this task is not well established in practice. Usually, testing resources are uniformly distributed among all parts of the software. A risk of this approach is that parts which contain defects are not sufficiently tested, whereas areas that do not contain defects attain too much consideration. In this thesis, a systematic approach is introduced that allows testers to make justified decisions on the test foci. For this purpose, structural as well as historical characteristics of the software’s past releases are analysed visually and statistically in order to find indicators for the software’s defects. Structural characteristics refer to the internal structure of the software. This thesis concentrates on the analysis of bad software characteristics, also known as “bad smells”. Historical characteristics considered in this thesis are the software’s change history and the software’s age. Simple and combined analyses of defect variance are introduced in order to determine indicators for defects in software. For this purpose, the defect variance analysis diagram is used to explore the relationship between the software’s characteristics and its faultiness visually. Then, statistical procedures are applied in order to determine whether the results obtained visually are statistically significant. The approach is validated in the context of open source development as well as in an industrial setting. For this purpose, seven open source programs as well as several releases of a commercial program are analysed. Thus, the thesis increases the empirical body of knowledge concerning the empirical validation of indicators for defects in software. The results show that there is a subset of bad smells that are well <b>suited</b> as <b>indicators</b> for defects in software.

However, this suggestion is based on very limited data and {{there is a need for}} quantitative sea-level estimates to establish an accurate regional Holocene sea-level history. Intertidal foraminifera are well <b>suited</b> as sea-level <b>indicators</b> due to their quantifiable relationships with tidal heights. In this study we analyze surface sediments from mudflats and salt marshes in the Erme and Salcombe-Kingsbridge estuaries, south Devon, to provide an intertidal foraminifera-based transfer function for reconstructing Ho-locene sea-level change in southwest England, UK. Forami-nifera were identified from 113 contemporary salt-marsh and mudflat samples, spanning a vertical range between 22. 6 m below and + 2. 6 m above mean tide level (MTL). Foraminif-eral assemblages exhibit a distinct and comparable vertical zonation in both estuaries. Reophax spp., Eggerella scabra and Elphidium oceanensis live preferentially around MTL, and both Trochammina inflata and Haplophragmoides spp. are useful indicators of high marsh environments. Weighted averaging partial least squares regression analysis on dead assemblages, using height in relation to MTL as the dependent variable, produces a transfer function capable of predicting paleo-sea-level positions with a precision of 60. 285 m.

40|$|The middle {{atmosphere}} {{is a very}} important part of the Earth system. Until recently, we did not realize the importance of the structure of this vaporous shell and of the fundamental role it plays in both creating and sustaining life on the planet. Thanks to the development and improvement of new sounding methods and techniques, our knowledge of the composition of the atmosphere has become more detailed than ever before. We have also learned how to reveal complex interactions between different species and how they react to the incoming solar radiation. The middle part of the Earth’s atmosphere serves as a host for the Polar Mesospheric Clouds. These clouds consist of a thin layer of water-ice particles, only exsisting during the summer months and only close to the poles. There are indications that the occurrence of Polar Mesospheric Clouds may be linked to climate change. It has been pointed out that the first sightings coincide with the industrial revolution. Satellite observations have shown that Polar Mesospheric Clouds have become brighter and possibly more widely distributed during the 20 th century. The clouds might therefore be <b>suited</b> as <b>indicators</b> of the variability of the climate - a good reason for studying this night-shimmering phenomena. The clouds can also be used as a proxy for middle atmospheric dynamics. In order to fully utilize Polar Mesospheric Clouds as tracers for atmospheric variability and dynamics, we need to better understand their local properties. The Optical Spectrograph and Infra-Red Imager System (OSIRIS) is one of two instruments installed on the Odin satellite. The optical spectrograph of this instrument observes sunlight scattered by the atmosphere and thus the Polar Mesospheric Clouds. This thesis deals with a tomographic technique that can reconstruct both horizontal and vertical structures of the clouds by using observations from various angles of the atmospheric region. From this information, microphysical properties such as particle sizes and number densities are obtained. The tomographic technique presented in this thesis also provides a basis for a new satellite concept - MATS. The idea behind the MATS satellite mission is to analyze wave activity in the atmosphere over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, based on the scientific heritage from Odin/OSIRIS and the tomographic algorithms presented in this thesis.

However, studies comparing plant species diversity in forests with different management types and intensity, extending over different regions and forest stages, and including detailed information on site conditions are missing. We studied vascular plants on 1500 20 m × 20 m forest plots in three regions of Germany (Schwäbische Alb, Hainich-Dün, Schorfheide-Chorin). In all regions, our study plots comprised different management types (unmanaged, selection cutting, deciduous and coniferous age-class forests, which resulted from clear cutting or shelterwood logging), various stand ages, site conditions, and levels of management-related disturbances. We analyzed how overall richness and richness of different plant functional groups (trees, shrubs, herbs, herbaceous species typically growing in forests and herbaceous light-demanding species) responded to the different management types. On average, plant species richness was 13 % higher in age-class than in unmanaged forests, and did not differ between deciduous age-class and selection forests. In age-class forests of the Schwäbische Alb and Hainich-Dün, coniferous stands had higher species richness than deciduous stands. Among age-class forests, older stands with large quantities of standing biomass were slightly poorer in shrub and light-demanding herb species than younger stands. Among deciduous forests, the richness of herbaceous forest species was generally lower in unmanaged than in managed forests, and it was even 20 % lower in unmanaged than in selection forests in Hainich-Dün. Overall, these findings show that disturbances by management generally increase plant species richness.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of vector-borne diseases {{can be understood}} as the output of a complex interplay among three components: the vector/host, the pathogen and the environment. The environmental factors that determine disease risk are those affecting the habitat conditions for vectors/hosts, the presence and prevalence of pathogens and the human exposure to pathogens. Monitoring these factors is a major task in epidemiology that, giventhe complexity of the underlying mechanisms, often demands interdisciplinary approaches. Nephropathia epidemica (NE) and Lyme borreliosis (LB) are vector-borne diseases for which awareness has increased in Western Europe as remarkable outbreaks for both diseases have been reported in recent years. NE is caused by the Puumala virus (PUUV) hosted by the bank vole Myodes glareolus. Humans get in contact with the virus by inhalation of aerosolized dry excreta. LB is caused by the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi that can be harbored by rodents (like Myodes glareolus), birds, reptiles, amongst other. This pathogen reaches humans by means of bites of the tick Ixodes ricinus. The life cycle and demography of these vector/hosts organisms is tightly related to the physical characteristics andthe dynamics of the vegetative systems supporting their populations. The spatial attributes (location, size, adjacency to urban centres) of these vegetated areas is also an important determinant of the spatial spread of the diseases. The framework of this research was an interdisciplinary initiative aimed at assessing the potential use of methods anddatasets from geomatics engineering in modelling the epidemiology of NEand LB. The prominent role of vegetative systems in NE and LB suggests that considering the spatial spread of vegetative systems and monitoringvegetation processes in time can support NE and LB epidemiologic modelling. In this regard, spaceborne remote sensing of vegetation is particularly interesting as it delivers georeferenced datasets on vegetation-related phenomena at regular time steps. This dissertation is organized in seven chapters. The introductory chapter gives a general description of NE and LB, the organisms involved in the transmission of the pathogens and the determinants of disease risk. It offers also some considerations on the computation of disease risk and basic principles on the use of remote sensing to study vegetation-related phenomena. Chapter 2 is based on evidences on the role of vegetation phenology in the demography of rodents. In this Chapter, phenology metrics of forested areasin southern Belgium were derived from time series of vegetation indicescomputed from remotely sensed reflectance values. These metrics were contrasted to reported NE occurrences in the neighboring areas. The focus in this chapter is broad-leaved forest patches located in the part of the country with the highest incidence values. The obtained results verified correspondence between the trend in seasonal indicators of vegetationactivity as derived fromremote sensing observations and the reported NE number of cases in the studied area. Chapter 3 was based on the known fact that humidity is a major factor in tick ecology. This chapter presents an analysis of time series of two remotely sensed indices with sensitivity to vegetation greenness and moisture as explanatory variables of LB incidence. The study was conducted in two high incidence areas (northern and southern Belgium) where landscape conditions are different and evaluates the performance of two moisture-sensitive vegetation indices. These vegetation indices rely on the sensitivity of the short-wave infrared region to humidity. The difference between the two indices was the utilized specific wavelength range on the short-wave infrared region. The results suggested thatconducting multiresolution analysis on time series of moisture sensitive vegetation indices can reveal seasonal or annual patterns that may have impacted disease incidence. Moreover, the resulted also showed that the performance of the two evaluated indicesdiffered in function of characteristics of the vegetated areas. Chapter 4 highlights the connection between NE and LB disease risk and land cover classes and landscape features. In this Chapter, tree-structured regression was implemented to investigate the associations between the spatial spread of NE and LB and landscape attributes. The studied was based on the CORINE land cover map and assessed the impact of different sampling settings in the derived associations. Chapter 5 proposedan adaptation {{of one of the most}} commonly used spatial interaction models: the gravity model. This spatial interaction model has been applied in different fields where the response variable is a function of the attraction (or an analogous measure) between two bodies. For our application, the tested hypothesis was that distance between vegetated and urban areas in combination with the size of the areas could model disease risk by means of a gravity model analysis. Given the existence of occupational risk in the diseases under study, an indicator of exposure through the conduction of outdoor labor activity was used as well. The results were satisfactory and show the suitability of both land cover maps andspaceborne datasets to derive information on vegetated areas for implementing the model. Chapter 6 focused on the identification of seasonal indicators of vegetation conditions as potential predictors to be used in spatio-temporaldisease risk models. Based on the results of Chapters 2 and 3, a number of annual indicators of vegetation activity were derived; additionally, the notion of Growing Degree Days (GDD) was applied to obtain seasonal GDD values. By means of multivariate analysis, the set of more <b>suited</b> <b>indicators</b> was chosen for northern and southern Belgium. The results showed that the best set of indicators was obtained whenindicators based solely on meteorologic datasets (GDD) were combined with indi-cators obtained from remote sensing signals.

These have a strong impact on stellar models and their fundamental parameters. The most promising method to reduce these uncertainties is to use asteroseismology to derive diagnostics probing the structural characteristics of these regions. Aims. We wish to use custom-made integrated quantities to improve the capabilities of seismology to probe convective regions in stellar interiors. We hope {{to increase the number}} of indicators obtained with structural seismic inversions to provide additional constraints on stellar models and the fundamental parameters determined from theoretical modeling. Methods. First, we present new kernels associated with a proxy of the entropy in stellar interiors. We then show how these kernels can be used to build custom-made integrated quantities probing convective regions inside stellar models. We present two <b>indicators</b> <b>suited</b> to probe convective cores and envelopes, respectively, and test them on artificial data. Results. We show that it is possible to probe both convective cores and envelopes using appropriate indicators obtained with structural inversion techniques. These indicators provide direct constraints on a proxy of the entropy of the stellar plasma, sensitive to the characteristics of convective regions. These constraints can then be used to improve the modeling of solar-like stars by providing an additional degree of selection of models obtained from classical forward modeling approaches.

40|$|International audienceGiven {{the coarse}} spatial {{resolution}} of General Circulation Models, finer scale projections of variables affected by local-scale {{processes such as}} precipitation are often needed to drive impacts models, for example in hydrology or ecology among other fields. This need for high-resolution data leads to apply projection techniques called downscaling. Downscaling can be performed according to two approaches: dynamical and statistical models. The latter approach is constituted by various statistical families conceptually different. If several studies have made some intercomparisons of existing downscaling models, none of them included all those families and approaches {{in a manner that}} all the models are equally considered. To this end, the present study conducts an intercomparison exercise under the EURO- and MED-CORDEX initiative hindcast framework. Six Statistical Downscaling Models (SDMs) and five Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are compared in terms of precipitation outputs. The downscaled simulations are driven by the ERAinterim reanalyses over the 1989 – 2008 period over a common area at 0. 44 ° of resolution. The 11 models are evaluated according to four aspects of the precipitation: occurrence, intensity, as well as spatial and temporal properties. For each aspect, one or several indicators are computed to discriminate the models. The results indicate that marginal properties of rain occurrence and intensity are better modelled by stochastic and resampling-based SDMs, while spatial and temporal variability are better modelled by RCMs and resampling-based SDM. These general conclusions have to be considered with caution because they rely on the chosen indicators and could change when considering other specific criteria. The <b>indicators</b> <b>suit</b> specific purpose and therefore the model evaluation results depend on the end-users point of view and how they intend to use with model outputs. Nevertheless, building on previous intercomparison exercises, this study provides a consistent intercomparison framework, including both SDMs and RCMs, which is designed to be flexible, i. e., other models and indicators can easily be added. More generally, this framework provides a tool to select the downscaling model to be used according to the statistical properties of the local-scale climate data to drive properly specific impact models...|$|R
40|$|All {{numerical}} {{models of}} friction damped bladed arrays require knowledge of contact-friction parameters, which are established either through direct frictional measurements, {{done with the}} help of a separate single contact test arrangement, or by fine tuning the parameters in the numerical model of the real damping device and comparing the experimental response of a damped blade against its computed response. Recent results from direct measurements on underplatform dampers and the subsequent cross-comparison of experimental and numerical results have put into evidence several features which are usually neglected in FE models of damper-blade systems: - markedly different friction coefficients at different contact points; - friction coefficients evolving with time and cycle number towards a stable shape, in a systematic and repeatable manner with dramatic consequences on the shape of the hysteresis cycle and on dissipated energy; - particular cases where minimal variations in the friction coefficients lead to gross changes of the damper behavior; Identifying the contact parameters to assure the best match between model and experimental results becomes crucial to guarantee that the validated damper model will produce the correct cyclic forces on the blades during vibrational motion. While the tuning process described in the previous papers was a search based on the progressive refinement whose results depended on the operator's ability to match different patterns of the model and experimental results, this paper dwells on a more objective and controllable method based on properly chosen indicators. The latter method is based on a sampling technique (Latin Hypercube) which produces a large number of solutions (in the present case 5000) on the basis of randomized extractions of contact parameters (in the present case 5) between given boundaries. An advantage of this method is a systematic exploration of the influence of each input contact parameter on the collection of output indicators, considered acceptable according to predetermined criteria. The main <b>indicators</b> <b>suited</b> for the purpose are three, i. e., the relative errors on the real and imaginary parts of the HBM complex spring equivalent to the hysteresis cycle and a measure of shape similarity between the experimental and simulated cycle. The paper shows the selection procedure which has been adopted to produce the final set of eligible solutions, which are further reduced by applying a secondary indicator based on the similarity of a kinematical parameter. In this paper this parameter is chosen to be a measure of the shape similarity of the damper rotationduring the hysteresis cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work has been to develop a generic {{framework}} {{with a set of}} <b>indicators,</b> <b>suited</b> for ensuring that technology will be successfully transferred. It was stressed that the framework should be generic, as it should be suitable for projects with differing technologies, locations and environments. Methodology:The development of the indicators followed a systematic and rigorous process, starting with formulation of visions, sub-visions and goals for successful technology transfer. The formulation was completed in the specialisation project during the autumn 2010. The indicators were then prepared in response to the formulated goals, and categorized within either the social, institutional, environmental, business or technological dimension. The indicators are for practical purposes gathered in a Protocol, which provides a complete tool for considering technology transfer on the project level. To further operationalize the Protocol, a technology-specific set of indicators was called for. As a response, one indicator set for hydropower, and one indicator set for wind power is prepared. The indicator development was an iterative process, where the indicators were reviewed by experts and tested on ongoing projects. Firstly, a Delphi Survey was conducted, with academics and practitioners within the fields of international energy production and technology transfer. The survey had 12 respondents from 11 different organisations. Secondly, the validity of the indicator set was attempted indicated by comparing the result of using the Protocol, with the observed technology transfer track record for two operating projects. Results:The Delphi Survey showed that the experts agreed that the indicators for assessing technology transfer potential in general were of high quality, and their suggestions for further improvements were later implemented. The case studies showed that the results of using the Protocol indeed correlated with the observed technology transfer in both projects. However, this is only regarded as an indication of the validity of the Protocol, not as a rigorous proof. Conclusion and further work: The work with this thesis has culminated in a Protocol for assessing the potential for technology transfer in energy projects. The indicators are thoroughly reviewed and applied. To further validate the Protocol as a tool predicting technology transfer, an extensive study should be conducted with a large number of projects, where the results from applying the Protocol in the early stages are compared with the observed technology transfer. Additionally, more technology-specific indicator sets could be prepared for other forms of energy production technologies. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{ecosystem}} approach to fisheries (EAF) is {{widely recognized as}} desirable for fisheries management. To progress towards the implementation of an EAF, a {{first step is to}} identify which species co-occur by quantifying assemblage structure in these habitats. A second step is the selection and development of ecological indicators to evaluate and to quantify the ecological state of exploited marine ecosystems. I examined groundfish assemblage structure in relation to depth, in two exploited marine ecosytems, the Southern Grand Banks of Newfoundland and the Flemish Cap, using multivariate analysis. Then I evaluated the status of the two ecosystem using a <b>suit</b> of ecological <b>indicators.</b> Finally, I tested different trajectories at two different depths to examine the population structure of the three species of redfish using Multivariate Autoregressive State Space Models (MARSS). I also included covariates to analyze their effect on population size. I used data obtained from two multispecies bottom trawl surveys performed by the Spanish Administration in the Southern Grand Banks (3 NO survey) from 2002 to 2014, and the European Union (EU) in the Flemish Cap (3 M survey) from 1991 to 2015, in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Regulatory Area (NAFO RA). A total of 1526 hauls were made between 2002 and 2014 in the 3 NO survey, and 3633 hauls between 1991 and 2015 in the 3 M survey. Total catch of the surveys for those periods was 1. 482. 116 kg in 3 NO and 1. 268. 660 in 3 M. Three major main fish assemblages were indentified (38 – 300, 301 – 600, and 601 – 1460 m depth in 3 NO; 129 – 250, 251 – 600, and 601 – 1460 m in 3 M). Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in both areas, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remained similar over time. Indices responded to different exploitation patterns, management, and environmental regimes in each assemblage. MARSS analysis identified separate trajectories for each species in each depth but one overall population growth rate with commercial catch as a covariate. Thus, while biomass trends for each species in each depth showed some temporal independence, all showed the same long-term changes. Thus there was data support to confirm that species could be treated together as a single management unit and to suggest that fishing is an important driver. This study revealed important spatial structure in the fish assemblages in the two fishing grounds and highlights the importance of calculating indicators in each assemblage in order to compare Summary areas and periods under different fishing pressure. This thesis represents a contribution towards the management through a multispecies approach in NAF...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{and remote}} {{communities}} in tropical Queensland are among Australia’s most vulnerable {{in the face}} of climate change. At the same time, these socially and economically vulnerable regions house some of Australia’s most significant biodiversity values. Past approaches to terrestrial biodiversity management have focused on tackling biophysical interventions through the use of biophysical knowledge. An equally important focus should be placed on building regional-scale community resilience if some of the worst biodiversity impacts of climate change are to be avoided or mitigated. Despite its critical need, more systemic or holistic approaches to natural resource management have been rarely trialed and tested in a structured way. Currently, most strategic interventions in improving regional community resilience are ad hoc, not theory-based and short term. Past planning approaches have not been durable, nor have they been well informed by clear indicators. Research into indicators for community resilience has been poorly integrated within adaptive planning and management cycles. This project has aimed to resolve this problem by: * Reviewing the community and social resilience and adaptive planning literature to reconceptualise an improved framework for applying community resilience concepts; * Harvesting and extending work undertaken in MTSRF Phase 1 to identifying the learnings emerging from past MTSRF research; * Distilling these findings to identify new theoretical and practical approaches to the application of community resilience in natural resource use and management; * Reconsidering the potential interplay between a region’s biophysical and social planning processes, with a focus on exploring spatial tools to communicate climate change risk and its consequent environmental, economic and social impacts, and; * Trialling new approaches to indicator development and adaptive planning to improve community resilience, using a sub-regional pilot in the Wet Tropics. In doing so, we also looked at ways to improve the use and application of relevant spatial information. Our theoretical review drew upon the community development, psychology and emergency management literature to better frame the concept of community resilience relative to aligned concepts of social resilience, vulnerability and adaptive capacity. Firstly, we consider community resilience as a concept that can be considered at a range of scales (e. g. regional, locality, communities of interest, etc.). We also consider that overall resilience at higher scales will be influenced by resilience levels at lesser scales (inclusive of the resilience of constituent institutions, families and individuals). We illustrate that, at any scale, resilience and vulnerability are not necessarily polar opposites, and that some understanding of vulnerability is important in determining resilience. We position social resilience (a concept focused on the social characteristics of communities and individuals) as an important attribute of community resilience, but one that needs to be considered alongside economic, natural resource, capacity-based and governance attributes. The findings from the review of theory and MTSRF Phase 1 projects were synthesized and refined by the wider project team. Five predominant themes were distilled from this literature, research review and an expert analysis. They include the findings that: 1. Indicators have most value within an integrated and adaptive planning context, requiring an active co-research relationship between community resilience planners, managers and researchers if real change is to be secured; 2. Indicators of community resilience form the basis for planning for social assets and the resilience of social assets is directly related the longer term resilience of natural assets. This encourages and indeed requires the explicit development and integration of social planning within a broader natural resource planning and management framework; 3. Past indicator research and application has not provided a broad picture of the key attributes of community resilience and there have been many attempts to elicit lists of “perfect” indicators that may never be useful within the time and resource limitations of real world regional planning and management. We consider that modeling resilience for proactive planning and prediction purposes requires the consideration of simple but integrated clusters of attributes; 4. Depending on time and resources available for planning and management, the combined use of well <b>suited</b> <b>indicators</b> and/or other lesser “lines of evidence” is more flexible than the pursuit of perfect indicators, and that; 5. Index-based, collaborative and participatory approaches need to be applied to the development, refinement and reporting of indicators over longer time frames. We trialed the practical application of these concepts via the establishment of a collaborative regional alliance of planners and managers involved in the development of climate change adaptation strategies across tropical Queensland (the Gulf, Wet Tropics, Cape York and Torres Strait sub-regions). A focus on the Wet Tropics as a pilot sub-region enabled other Far North Queensland sub-region’s to participate and explore the potential extension of this approach. The pilot activities included: * Further exploring ways to innovatively communicate the region’s likely climate change scenarios and possible environmental, economic and social impacts. We particularly looked at using spatial tools to overlay climate change risks to geographic communities and social vulnerabilities within those communities; * Developing a cohesive first pass of a State of the Region-style approach to reporting community resilience, inclusive of regional economic viability, community vitality, capacitybased and governance attributes. This framework integrated a literature review, expert (academic and community) and alliance-based contributions; and * Early consideration of critical strategies that need to be included in unfolding regional planning activities with Far North Queensland. The pilot assessment finds that rural, indigenous and some urban populations in the Wet Tropics are highly vulnerable and sensitive to climate change and may require substantial support to adapt and become more resilient. This assessment finds that under current conditions (i. e. if significant adaptation actions are not taken) the Wet Tropics as a whole may be seriously impacted by the most significant features of climate change and extreme climatic events. Without early and substantive action, this could result in declining social and economic wellbeing and natural resource health. Of the four attributes we consider important to understanding community resilience, the Wet Tropics region is particularly vulnerable in two areas; specifically its economic vitality and knowledge, aspirations and capacity. The third and fourth attributes, community vitality and institutional governance are relatively resilient but are vulnerable in some key respects. In regard to all four of these attributes, however, there is some emerging capacity to manage the possible shocks that may be associated with the impacts of climate change and extreme climatic events. This capacity needs to be carefully fostered and further developed to achieve broader community resilience outcomes. There is an immediate need to build individual, household, community and sectoral resilience across all four attribute groups to enable populations and communities in the Wet Tropics region to adapt {{in the face of}} climate change. Preliminary strategies of importance to improve regional community resilience have been identified. These emerging strategies also have been integrated into the emerging Regional Development Australia Roadmap, and this will ensure that effective implementation will be progressed and coordinated. They will also inform emerging strategy development to secure implementation of the FNQ 2031 Regional Plan. Of most significance in our view, this project has taken a co-research approach from the outset with explicit and direct importance and influence within the region’s formal planning and management arrangements. As such, the research: * Now forms the foundations of the first attempt at “Social Asset” planning within the Wet Tropics Regional NRM Plan review; * Is assisting Local government at regional scale to consider aspects of climate change adaptation in emerging planning scheme/community planning processes; * Has partnered the State government (via the Department of Infrastructure and Planning and Regional Managers Coordination Network Chair) in progressing the Climate Change adaptation agenda set down within the FNQ 2031 Regional Plan; * Is informing new approaches to report on community resilience within the GBRMPA Outlook reporting framework; and * Now forms the foundation for the region’s wider climate change adaptation priorities in the Regional Roadmap developed by Regional Development Australia. Through the auspices of Regional Development Australia, the outcomes of the research will now inform emerging negotiations concerning a wider package of climate change adaptation priorities with State and Federal governments. Next stage research priorities are also being developed to enable an ongoing alliance between researchers and the region’s climate change response...|$|R
40|$|Three color-indicating {{devices have}} been {{conceived}} as simple, rapid, inexpensive means of detecting hazardous liquid and gaseous substances in settings in which safety is of paramount concern {{and it would}} be too time-consuming or otherwise impractical to perform detection by use of such instruments as mass spectrometers. More specifically, these devices are designed for detecting hypergolic fuels (in particular, hydrazines) and hypergolic oxidizers in spacecraft settings, where occasional leakage of these substances in liquid or vapor form occurs and it is imperative to take early corrective action to minimize adverse health effects. With suitable redesign, including reformulation of their color indicator chemicals, these devices could be adapted to detection of other hazardous substances in terrestrial settings (e. g., industrial and military ones). One of the devices is a pad of a commercially available absorbent material doped with a color indicator. The absorbent material is made from 70 percent polyester and 30 percent nylon and can absorb about eight times its own weight of liquid. The color indicator is a mixture of conventional pH color indicator chemicals. Hydrazine and monomethyl hydrazine, which are basic, cause the color indicator to turn green. In the original intended application, the pad is wiped on a space suit that is suspected of having been exposed to leaking monomethyl hydrazine during a space walk, before the wearer returns to the interior of the spacecraft. If the wiped surface is contaminated with hydrazine, the pad turns green. In addition, the pad absorbs hydrazine from the wiped surface, thereby reducing or eliminating the hazard. Used pads, including ones that show contamination by hydrazine, can be stored in a sealed plastic bag for subsequent disposal. The second device, which has been proposed but not yet developed, would comprise a color indicator material in the form of either a coating on a space suit (or other protective garment) or a coating on a sheet that could be easily attached to and detached from the protective garment. The coating material would be a hydrogel doped with a suitable pH indicator. The hydrogel would also serve to maintain a level of moisture needed to support the chemical reaction mentioned in the next sentence. In addition to changing color to indicate the presence of any hypergolic fuel (which is basic) or hypergolic oxidizer (which is acidic) that might splash on the space <b>suit,</b> the pH <b>indicator</b> would also react with the hypergolic fuel or oxidizer and thereby bind it. The third device is a color dosimeter for detecting hydrazine liquid or vapor coming from microscopic leaks. This device is designed to satisfy several requirements specific to its original intended use in the auxiliary power unit of the space shuttle. These requirements include stability under vacuum, stability at moderate temperature, fast and irreversible change in color upon exposure to hydrazine, and visibility of the color change through polyimide tape...|$|R
40|$|Antiparasitic {{disinfection}} manifests unjustifiable deficiencies to date (Hiepe, 2010). Though DVG guidelines specify {{methods for}} testing disinfectants on protozoa and helminths in the veterinary medical parasitary field, however, test procedures on malignant arthropods are not included. In this work, M. domestica {{was selected for}} {{the investigation of the}} disin-fectant efficacy test for surface disinfection being a potential representative of malignant arthropods, Victor (1999) and Mielke et al. (2001) had conducted preliminary investigations on M. domestica using a registered cresol-based test preparation. The aim of my own investigations was to test the suitability of this species as an indicator organism. For this purpose, initially M. domestica were bred. All M. domestica developmental stages (eggs, larvae I, larvae II, larvae III, pupae, imagines) were included in both, the procedural execution and the efficacy tests. After presenting an analysis of the publications on disinfection and M. domestica, the breeding of the housefly and the execution of the developed test procedures were described in detail. The efficacy tests were carried out using two different test preparations with different active substances. Test preparation 1 (active substances: o-hydroxydiphenyl-fatty acid-eutectic, peracetic acid) is found in the 13 th list of disinfectants by DVG (N. N., 2011 / 1) (Spectrum of efficacy: bactericidal, tuberculocidal, fungicidal, virucidal, antiparasitary (worm eggs, coccidia)). Test preparation 2 (Active substances: glutaraldehyde, glyoxal, formaldehyde, benzalkonium-chloride, didecyl-dimethylammonium-chloride) is not listed by DVG, but by DGHM and by RKI (Spectrum of efficacy: bactericidal, tuberculocidal, sporicidal, fungicidal, virus inactivating). The disinfectant efficacy tests were performed at every M. domestica stage in the suspension test and the germ carrier test as well; only the adult house flies were exclusively examined in the suspension test. The germ carrier tests were performed with two different materials – poplar and the back side of tiles. The test procedures and the germ carriers used both proved to be suited for the disinfectant testing. However, the time and labour required for examining certain developmental stages of M. domestica were adversely affected by their ability to move. As expected, M. domestica exhibited different susceptibilities to the tested active agents at the different stages of their development. It could be proven that M. domestica -eggs is the only developmental stage that did not meet the requirements by DVG (N. N., 2007) specified for A. suum - eggs in comparison, neither in the suspension tests nor in the germ carrier tests of the two test preparations. Thus the M. domestica - egg exhibited the lowest overall susceptibility to the two test preparations (table 1. 1 - 1. 3, table 2. 1 - 2. 3). The test procedures on M. domestica - eggs and - pupae are recommended as suitable. The consideration of tenacity as well as the execution of the test procedures resulted in this finding. Efficacy tests on holometabolous malignant arthropods should be performed in 2 steps. Step 1 : Test on pupae, step 2 : Test on eggs, whereas step 2 should only be performed, if step 1 brought positive findings. The test on heterometabolous insects is only recommended at one developmental stage, the egg. Considering the lower overall efficacy obtained, the material property and seen from an ecological and economic perspective the germ carrier poplar is to be preferred to the back side of tiles. The established breeding of M. domestica {{plays a major role in}} deciding for an indicator organism of malignant arthropods. Own investigations show that the cosmopolite M. domestica is <b>suited</b> as an <b>indicator</b> for disinfectant efficacy tests on malignant arthropods (specifically eggs and pupae of holometabola) in the suspension test and in the germ carrier test as well...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{report is}} the result of a literature study of published documents presenting the current water supply situation in Sub-Saharan Africa, in combination with a field trip to the Mpagne village in Cameroon. The objective of the project has been to study and discuss the current theoretical approach on sustainable water supply, as well as to generate possible technical solutions and present administrative changes required. A thorough background analysis demonstrates the need for improvement on a local village level as well as on a regional, national and international level. Key findings are high failure rates as a consequence of the absence of evaluation of past projects, as well as the fact that many agencies do not work in line with existing policies and theoretically developed approaches to solve the problem. Further, there is a general need to cultivate local political will for long-term commitment and funding of the sector. Although some of the organizations engaged in the sector have started to realise that there is a need for an alteration of approach angle, thus far there is little evidence of the change required to move towards universal coverage. A needs assessment and a requirement specification were developed based on the findings in the background analysis. This was then used to generate possible technical solutions to be further studied. In the process of deciding upon technical solutions, the information gathered in the village, especially that related to the previously implemented system, has been important. After analysing the data collected in Mpagne and studying available technology the following alternatives were developed: Alternative 1 : Groundwater exploitation with flywheel handpump, elevated storage tank and gravity based distribution to community tap standAlternative 2 : Rainwater harvesting with swale-trench filtration and flywheel handpump, elevated storage tank and gravity based distribution to community tap standAlternative 3 : Combination of groundwater exploitation and rainwater harvesting, similar to alternative 1, with the addition of RWH at the village school. In order to systematically compare these options and decide upon a best <b>suited</b> solution, the <b>indicator</b> comparison methodology developed during the fall project was used in combination with a SWOT-analysis of each concept. The final results obtained indicate that alternative 3 was slightly better than the other two alternatives. A description of the technology required for the new water supply facility in Mpagne was then presented to the level it is possible with the information available at this stage. The intention is for this to serve as an initial suggestion to be presented to the villagers for further discussion. The report continues with a discussion of an implementation strategy with an enhanced focus on how the technical system can be installed in Mpagne in a social, economic and environmentally sound context. The discussion covers the following four phases: 1. 	Planning 2. 	Construction 3. 	Operation and maintenance 4. 	Follow-up and evaluation This process will be especially important considering the past failed project in Mpagne, and an agency should give special attention to including the villagers in all levels from an early stage. This to avoid the deficiency between the solution implemented and the actual needs resulting from the past project. Further findings are the current situation of downgrading external factors such as the availability and reliability of spare part supply networks as well as lack of general technical support. This is a primary cause of project failure today. The lack of coordination amongst the sector operators, including NGO s, donor agencies, and local and international government entities, is also an important factor which slows down the progress of developing an efficient and effective water supply sector. Lastly, until internal village level factors as well as external regional and national aspects are adequately satisfied, the agencies operating in the rural water supply sector today have a great responsibility in terms of creating an enabling environment for sector development. Project conduction should be done in adherence with existing policies until the local governments and/or private partners have succeeded in developing an institutional framework to support a well-functioning water supply sector...|$|R
