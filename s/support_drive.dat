50|$|Support {{characters}} {{return with}} 2 new features. The first feature is Support Types. These types are Defense, Attack, and Balanced. Each of {{these can be}} unlocked for each support character and will decide {{the actions of the}} support character during <b>Support</b> <b>Drive</b> level 1. The 2nd new feature is the <b>Support</b> <b>Drive.</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Drive</b> has 2 levels. Level 1 is activated once the players support characters are summoned enough times. When <b>Support</b> <b>Drive</b> level 1 is activated, the players support characters will summon themselves automatically depending on their support type depending on what actions the player is executing. When a support character automatically summons itself, it will not reset the support character charge gauge, and can even summon when the gauge is not full. A support character cannot be manually summoned by the player if it has already automatically summoned itself. If a support character is set to Defense, it will automatically summon itself when the player is charging chakra, block the opponent from dashing into the player. When a support character is set to Attack, it will help the player attack the opponent through combos, and knock the opponent back when a combo sends them flying. When a support character is set to Balanced, they will throw projectiles alongside the player when the player uses chakra projectiles and block incoming Ultimate Jutsus, at the expense of losing that support for a while. When <b>Support</b> <b>Drive</b> level 2 is activated, for a limited amount of time the player will be capable of releasing a Team Ultimate Jutsu. A Team Ultimate Jutsu is activated by hitting the chakra button 3 times and then the attack button. A Team Ultimate Jutsu drains an enormous amount of the players chakra, and does massive damage if it makes contact with an unguarded opponent.|$|E

5000|$|The game {{introduced}} guard-break and counterattack and 100 {{characters and}} 14 only support characters [...] In the former, the player breaks the guard of the opponent, knocking {{him or her}} unconscious. This gives the player the opportunity to unleash a deadly attack to inflict serious damage. There is a limit, however, {{on the number of}} times it can be used. In regards to a counterattack, if an opponent is about to land an attack on the player, the players can knock them unconscious, rendering them helpless and sealing their support. Timing is the key here and a counterattack is a chakra-consuming action. The game also features a revamped support system. There are largely three types of teams. The Drive type locks the battle with a Sealed Barrier that always activates the <b>Support</b> <b>Drive</b> ability. Support Drives call in other team members to chain attacks with the player's main character or block for him {{depending on the type of}} support the three man cell provides. Ultimate Jutsu type is a team that can do a heavy damage super attack, which depends on the team the player use. Awakening team types can use an awakening at the start of the battle by using the right analog stick.|$|E

40|$|Analysis {{of public}} support for science & {{innovation}} should begin with the primary relation, namely economic evolution. Material ‘public support ’ is tapped from {{the wealth of the}} economic system, and innovation draws upon science to evolve the economy. Public institutions support the economy and economic growth strengthens public institutions. So, the real question here is with {{the role of the state}} in economic evolution. How can public <b>support</b> <b>drive</b> economic growth and evolution? This is a big question that deserves a good answer. My submission is this: evolutionary economic theory can provide such analysis and, given that, the Productivity Commission should consider trailing evolutionary economics in its report.

40|$|The {{business}} excellence {{models are}} used by many organisations {{around the world as}} a strategic driver for business improvement and in some cases as the basis for applications for awards based on the models. These include the Baldrige, EFQM, Australian Business Excellence Framework and many other national and regional models. Whilst many award recipients showcase their achievements, comparatively {{little is known about the}} challenges and impediments they face in reaching and sustaining high levels of success as evidenced by winning awards. This paper seeks to identify challenges faced by examining the experience of a sample of Australian Business Excellence Award winners. Findings suggest that the primary challenges include; leadership <b>support,</b> <b>drive</b> and consistency throughout the organisation and communicating strategy and making it meaningful for people at all levels.

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{identify}} important challenges to sustaining business excellence amongst award-winning companies in Australia. Design/methodology/approach: Companies which had won Australian Business Excellence Awards were chosen as cases {{for this research}} since they had used the excellence framework over many years and, having achieved significant results, now potentially faced issues in sustaining {{a high level of}} performance. Interviews with key managers, published materials and information provided during industry visits were used as the primary information sources in the study. Findings: Findings suggest that the primary challenges include; leadership <b>support,</b> <b>drive</b> and consistency throughout the organisation and communicating strategy and making it meaningful for people at all organisational levels. These were addressed {{in a variety of ways}} in the companies. Research limitations/implications: Companies which are successful at business excellence experience challenges which require ongoing management. Originality/value: This research offers insights into the difficulties faced by successful organisations in their quest to build and maintain excellence and how they manage these...|$|E
40|$|The {{present report}} sources internationally and nationally {{published}} ideas and concepts from the tourism academic literature concerning {{the future of}} tourism. The report employs these ideas for consideration in building tourism in Australia's tropics • Tropical Australia, defined as the area north of the Tropic of Capricorn, has multiple tourism resources including three World Heritage areas, four national landscapes, three significant touring routes and multi-faceted cultural capacities, including a strong Indigenous presence • Many tourism reports including the Jackson Report (Commonwealth of Australia, 2009) and the draft CSIRO document The Future of Tourism in Queensland (Hajkowicz, Cook, & Boughen, 2013) describe national pathways {{for the future of}} tourism. Other key studies including the document The Coalition's 2030 Vision for developing Northern Australia (Liberal National Party, 2013) and Stocktake of Regional Research: 50 pieces of influential regional research (Regional Australia Institute, 2012) clearly envisage an expanding future for northern Australia and offer targets for tourism (two million international tourists annually by 2030). These studies, and many others, do not specifically focus on the regional initiatives for delivering this desired future. • Additionally, even when new directions have been offered, the direct contribution of the national and northern academic voices to these conversations has been limited • The report is structured around a five part model to help develop new initiatives. It considers the roles of intelligence, information computer technology, investment, and industry know-how in contributing to future oriented action • Adopting a critical and applied appraisal of the international and national base of fundamental academic research, the report identifies 10 desirable initiatives and highlights action and policy directions for these themes 1. Developing tourism for community well-being Proposes a new wider set of measures for evaluating tourism's contribution to community well-being Offers examples of topics to be measured 2. Improving cross-industry opportunities Suggests that tourism and other important northern sectors - agriculture, mining, education and the military - could benefit from creating more tourism linked opportunities Recommends discussions to facilitate generic and business tourism linking these sectors 3. Reinforcing the well managed natural brand Argues for the further emphasis in marketing on the natural brand for tropical Australia but recommends an audit and visible demonstration of sustainable practices at sites to reinforce the brand An integrative and wide ranging review of tourists' safety and well-being in tropical environments is also suggested 4. Incorporating the slow tourism approach The value of linking to international market directions in slow tourism is noted as an underused but additional marketing emphasis 5. Boosting Indigenous opportunities Recommends scholarship support for advanced education for Indigenous Australians for professional futures and empowerment in tourism 6. Supporting the domestic backbone Argues for systematic soft and hard infrastructure development to <b>support</b> <b>drive</b> tourism Recommends a uniform approach to tourism discounts for local regional visitors Supports the importance of national and international sporting events being located in the region to boost local and out of region tourists 7. Consolidating the international strategies Recommends a focus on the young Chinese independent market Proposes using local voices and endogenous marketing to assure the authenticity of the experience appeal 8. Integrating quality markers Proposes exploring the integration and alignment between Australia's accreditation and recommendation systems with international approaches 9. Attending to research investment Notes the funding drought for fundamental and applied research in tourism at the northern/tropical scale while supporting the efforts of Tourism Research Australia for its particular role Proposes explicit restatement in Australian Research Council grant schemes and T-QUAL grant scheme for research in tourism as a nationally significant priority for funding Proposes greater interchange between government, industry and academic personnel in terms of visitor schemes and options similar to international practices in terms of senior business and government visitors and professors for a week 10. Refreshing educational, career and extension structures Introduces a potential tourism employment classification scheme which boosts transferability between tourism, events and leisure roles. Recommends the development of tourism extension officers, analogous to roles in other major sectors such as agriculture, to support the delivery of research and advisory information • A community based competition for innovative public tropical infrastructure is proposed in the context of recent global initiatives for tourism...|$|E

5000|$|In most DOS systems, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to have more than 26 mounted <b>drives.</b> Atari GEMDOS <b>supports</b> <b>drive</b> letters A: to P: only. The PalmDOS PCMCIA driver stack <b>supports</b> <b>drive</b> letters 0:, 1:, 2:, ... to address PCMCIA drive slots.Some Novell network drivers for DOS support up to 32 drive letters under compatible DOS versions. In addition to this, Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01 and DR-DOS 7.02 genuinely support a CONFIG.SYS LASTDRIVE=32 directive in order to allocate up to 32 drive letters, named A: to Z:, \:, :, ^:, _: and `:. (DR-DOS 7.02-7.07 also supports HILASTDRIVE and LASTDRIVEHIGH directives in order to relocate drive structures into upper memory.) Some DOS application programs do not expect drive letters beyond Z: and will not work with them, therefore it is recommended to use them for special purposes or search drives.JP Software's 4DOS command line processor <b>supports</b> <b>drive</b> letters beyond Z: in general, but since some of the letters clash with syntactical extensions of this command line processor, they need to be escaped in order to use them as drive letters.Windows 9x (MS-DOS 7.0/MS-DOS 7.1) added support for LASTDRIVE=32 and LASTDRIVEHIGH=32 as well.If access to more filesystems than Z: is required under Windows NT, Volume Mount Points must be used. However, it is possible to mount non-letter drives, such as 1:, 2:, or !: using the command line SUBST utility in Windows XP or Vista (i.e. [...] ), but this is not officially supported and may break programs that assume that all drive letters are A: to Z:.|$|R
