50|$|The Great Channel in the Inner Moray Firth, was dredged by {{engineers}} in 1917 for the safe passage of ships {{that wanted to}} avoid the long and dangerous passage around the north of Scotland, by transiting the Caledonian Canal. The Channel went from the entrance of Munlochy Bay to the Meikle Mee <b>Starboard</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>Mark,</b> but was not maintained and filled in very quickly.|$|E

Begin on the <b>starboard</b> <b>hand,</b> for instance, as you walk down Cheapside, and count as you go; my life for it, you'll reel off more houses in half an hour's walk than {{are to be found}} in all that there village yonder. Then you'll remember, sir, that the <b>starboard</b> <b>hand</b> only has half, every Jack having his Jenny. I look upon Lunnun as the finest sight in nature, Captain Cuffe, after all I have seen in many cruises!" ...|$|R

50|$|USS Wyoming {{then passed}} between the brig and the bark on the <b>starboard</b> <b>hand</b> and the steamer on the port, {{steaming}} within pistol shot range. One shot {{from either the}} bark or brig struck near Wyoming's forward broadside gun, killing two men and wounding four. Elsewhere on the ship, a Marine was struck dead by a piece of shrapnel.|$|R
60|$|They moved aft soon afterwards, and the Scarrowmania was {{smoothly}} sliding seawards {{with the}} first of the ebb when Agatha met Wyllard. He glanced at the Lancashire sandhills, which were fading into a pale ocher gleam amid the haze over the <b>starboard</b> <b>hand,</b> and then at the long row of painted buoys that moved back to them.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after, the Tecumseh {{was sent}} to join Admiral Farragut's fleet in the {{projected}} attack on Mobile. The position of Commander Craven in the attack, which took place August 5, was {{at the head of}} the column of monitors which was on the <b>starboard</b> <b>hand</b> of the wooden vessels between them and Fort Morgan.

6000|$|... "I {{went through}} my {{calculations}} yesterday, and I am {{sure that there is}} no mistake in the figures. If I am right, this is the island that we see ahead, the one called Samona; while that we see dimly away on the port hand is Mariguana. I don't see, by this map, any land marked that could be that which we see on the <b>starboard</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
60|$|Still, she crept on south, {{and at last}} all of {{them were}} {{sincerely}} glad when the pithead gear of the Dunsmore mines rose up against the forests of Vancouver Island over the <b>starboard</b> <b>hand.</b> An hour or two later Fleming stood blackened all over amidst a gritty cloud while the coal that was to free him from his cares clattered into the Shasta's bunkers, and Jimmy sat in the room beneath her bridge with one of the coaling clerks writing out a telegram.|$|R

[...] "Here, here," [...] he continued, {{speaking}} in a lower tone, as if fearful of being overheard, [...] "here she lies, sir, more to port; look into the streak of clear sky above the marsh, on the <b>starboard</b> <b>hand</b> of the wood, there; that long black line is her maintopmast; I know it by the rake; and there is her night-pennant fluttering about that bright star; ay, ay, sir, there go our own stars aloft yet, dancing among the stars in the heavens!

60|$|As the French, with Monsieur de Vervillin, {{were still}} {{half a mile}} to the southward and eastward of the {{approaching}} division, of their enemy, the Comte collected all his frigates and corvettes on his <b>starboard</b> <b>hand,</b> leaving a clear approach to Sir Gervaise on his larboard beam. This hint was understood, too, and the Plantagenet steered a course that would bring her up {{on that side of}} le Foudroyant, and at the distance of about one hundred yards from the muzzles of her guns. This threatened to be close work, and unusual work in fleets, at that day; but it was the game our commander-in-chief was fond of playing, and it was one, also, that promised soonest to bring matters to a result.|$|R

60|$|It was toward sunset that evening, and Miss Austerly {{was sitting}} well wrapped up on a locker in the cockpit, when the vapor melted and was blown away, as not {{infrequently}} happens {{about that time}} at sea. The dingy clouds that veiled the sky were rent, and a blaze of weird, coppery radiance smote the tumbling seas, which changed under it to smears of incandescent whiteness with ruddy gleams in them, and ridges of flashing green. It was sudden and bewildering, impelling one to hold one's breath. But a more glorious pageant leaped out of the dimness over the <b>starboard</b> <b>hand.</b> Walls of rock that burned with many colors sprang into being, with somber pines streaming upward behind them, and far aloft there were lifted gleaming heights of never-trodden snow whose stainless purity was intensified by their gray and turquoise shadows.|$|R

60|$|It {{was with}} {{somewhat}} mixed feelings, and a curious little smile in his eyes, that Jim Wheelock stood with a brown {{hand on the}} Tyee's wheel as the deep-loaded schooner slid out through Vancouver Narrows before a fresh easterly breeze. Dim heights of snow rose faintly white against the creeping dusk above her <b>starboard</b> <b>hand,</b> and the busy British Columbian city, girt with mazy wires and towering telegraph poles, was fading slowly amidst the great black pines astern. An aromatic smell of burning followed the schooner, and from the levels {{at the head of}} the Inlet a long gray smear blew out across the water. A fire which had, as not infrequently happens, passed the bounds of somebody's clearing was eating its way into that part of the great coniferous forest that rolls north from Oregon to Alaska along the wet seaboard of the Pacific Slope.|$|R

50|$|Haisborough Sands (or Haisboro Sands or Haisbro Sands) is a {{sandbank}} off {{the coast}} of Norfolk, England at Happisburgh. The shoal is 10 mi long and 1 mi wide and lies parallel to the North east coast of Norfolk. The shoal is marked to the north-west by north by the Haisbro Light Buoy, North cardinal. To the south-east by south is a light buoy South cardinal, and to the west by Mid Haisbro light buoy <b>starboard</b> <b>hand.</b> In 1995 there were three drying patches recorded to the north-north east and east-south east of the Mid Haisbro light buoy. Except at slack water their positions are indicated by tidal eddies and in slight or moderate seas the swell breaks on the shallower parts of the banks. There are a number of foul patches on {{the southern part of the}} shoal. There are very strong eddies on and around the bank especially on the north west. Over the years this shoal has claimed many ships.|$|R
