2500|$|The natural {{extension}} of the Staunch was to provide an upper gate (or pair of gates) to form an intermediate [...] "pound" [...] which was all that need be emptied when a boat passed through. This type of lock, called a pound lock was known in Imperial China and Europe [...] Note the change in terminology: on a British Canal, it is the <b>section</b> of canal <b>between</b> <b>locks</b> that is called a pound.|$|R
5000|$|The canal begins near Povenets {{settlement}} in Povenets bay of Lake Onega. After Povenets {{there are seven}} locks close together, forming the [...] "Stairs of Povenets". These locks are the southern slope of the canal. The canal summit pond at 103 meters elevation is 22 km long <b>between</b> <b>locks</b> 7 & 8. The northern slope has twelve locks numbered 8-19. The route of the northern slope runs through five large lakes; Lake Matkozero <b>between</b> <b>locks</b> 8 & 9, Lake Vygozero <b>between</b> <b>locks</b> 9 & 10, Lake Palagorka <b>between</b> <b>locks</b> 10 & 11, Lake Voitskoye <b>between</b> <b>locks</b> 11 & 12 and Lake Matkozhnya <b>between</b> <b>locks</b> 13 & 14. The canal empties out into the Soroka Bay of the White Sea at Belomorsk. The settlements of Povenets, Segezha, Nadvoitsy, Sosnovets, and Belomorsk are located along the canal.|$|R

5000|$|On some American canals, some pounds {{acquired}} nicknames {{due to the}} mileage <b>between</b> <b>locks,</b> e.g. the [...] "Eight Mile Level" [...] on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was <b>between</b> Riley's <b>Lock</b> (Lock 24) and Edward's Ferry (Lock 25), {{a distance}} of about eight miles.|$|R

2500|$|The {{stretch of}} canal <b>between</b> <b>locks</b> {{is called a}} level. Canalers called these levels by their lengths; for instance, the longest level was the 14 mile level, which was about 14 miles long, and ran from Lock 50 (at 4 locks) to Lock 51 in Hancock. Some levels had {{additional}} nicknames (since some had similar lengths), e.g. [...] "Four Mile Level below Dam 6", [...] "Four Mile Level Big Slackwater", or [...] "Four Mile Level of the Log Wall" [...] (which is <b>between</b> <b>locks</b> 14 and 15, includes Widewater, Anglers, Carderock, Billy Goat Trails B, and C, and the downstream entrance to Trail A, all connect on that level) Levels {{less than a mile}} <b>between</b> <b>locks</b> were called short levels. Waste weirs and bypass flumes at the locks helped control the height of water in the levels (see below about waste weirs).|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{extend the}} {{traditional}} relationships <b>between</b> <b>locks,</b> i. e., shared and non-shared, to permit sharing in a constrained manner. The new relationship <b>between</b> <b>locks</b> {{enables us to}} develop a family of locking protocols, the least permissive of which is two phase locking while the most permissive accepts all order-preserving conflict serializable histories. The latter protocol also accepts all conflict serializable histories without reordering read and write operations. Instances {{of the family of}} protocols can cope with a variety of database recovery problems...|$|R
50|$|Other {{problems}} are less obvious. For example, certain interactions <b>between</b> <b>locks</b> {{can lead to}} error conditions such as deadlock, livelock, and priority inversion. Using locks also involves a trade-off <b>between</b> coarse-grained <b>locking,</b> which can significantly reduce opportunities for parallelism, and fine-grained locking, which requires more careful design, increases locking overhead and is more prone to bugs.|$|R

25|$|There were {{a number}} of stop gates {{throughout}} the canal, e.g. <b>between</b> <b>lock</b> 16 and lock 17, on section 17. For some reason, the list Unrau has does not list that lock. The others are listed by section number along the canal, but he did not provide a list of where the section numbers correspond to mileage numbers along the canal. Note that the greatest number of stop gates were <b>between</b> <b>Lock</b> 50 and 51, that is the 14 mile level which includes Big Pool. There are stop gates both before and after Big pool.|$|R
