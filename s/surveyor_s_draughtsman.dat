30|$|Next, we {{evaluated}} whether CT modification on sgRNA {{led to a}} higher genome editing efficiency. We delivered each AAVS 1 sgRNA structure together with in vitro transcribed Cas 9 mRNA into K 562 cells by electroporation and analyzed genome disruption frequencies by <b>Surveyor</b> assay (Fig. <b>S</b> 2 A). Consistent with the improved stability, CTsgRNA led to higher insertion or/and deletion (indel) frequencies (26.90 %) compared to control sgRNA (15.29 %), while the sgRNAs with other structures had an editing efficiency lower than control (Fig. S 2 A). Improved gene editing efficiency using CTsgRNAs was also obtained at the VEGFA, EMX 1, HBB and PD 1 loci in K 562 cells, with indel frequency quantified using tracking of indels by decomposition (TIDE) analysis (Figs.  1 C and <b>S</b> 3), <b>Surveyor</b> assay (Fig. <b>S</b> 2 B) and chip-based QuantStudio 3 D digital PCR (Fig. S 4).|$|R

50|$|The former Ipswich and West Moreton Building Society {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1888 {{to the design of}} the former Queensland Colonial Architect, F.G.D. Stanley. The Ipswich and West Moreton Building Society was the first building society established in Ipswich, {{and one of the first}} in Queensland. It was established in 1877 to meet a very real need for housing finance. A board of directors was appointed in July 1877 including chairman Enoch Bostock, directors E.W. Hargreaves, J. Scott and D. McKay, trustees W. Ginn, J. Mcfarlane and R. Tallon, <b>surveyor</b> <b>S.</b> Shenton and secretary T.W. Hoey. As there was no legislation covering building societies, the Ipswich society was registered in September 1877 under the Friendly Societies Act 1876. It was eventually registered again on 5 May 1887 when the Queensland Parliament passed the Building Society Act 1886. The tradition of building societies goes back to the beginning of the industrial revolution in England in the late 18th century. They were first formed by local members of working class communities to help each other finance the building of houses, of which there was a severe lack in the new industrial centres. They were a part of the self-help and mutual aid movement which saw the birth of friendly societies and trade unions as well as building societies in response to the lack of social welfare and protection for working class members of society. The first building society legislation in Australia came about in 1840 and from the beginnings of building societies in Australia in the nineteenth century they became an important part of the financial market during the 20th century. With the turn of the 21st century many of the original building societies have been taken over by larger financial institutions.|$|R

40|$|Life {{as we know}} it {{requires}} water with a chemical activity (alpha) >or approx. 0. 6 and sources of nutrients and useful energy. Some biota can survive even if favorable conditions occur only intermittently, but the minimum required frequency of occurrences is poorly understood. Recent discoveries have vindicated the Mars exploration strategy to follow the water. Mars Global <b>Surveyor</b> <b>s</b> Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) found coarse-grained hematite at Meridiani Planum. Opportunity rover confirmed this and also found evidence of ancient sulfate-rich playa lakes and near-surface groundwater. Elsewhere, TES found evidence of evaporitic halides in topographic depressions. But alpha might not have approached 0. 6 in these evaporitic sulfate- and halide-bearing waters. Mars Express (MEX) and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) found extensive sulfate evaporites in Meridiani and Valles Marineris. MEX found phyllosilicates at several sites, most notably Mawrth Valles and Nili Fossae. MRO's CRISM near-IR mapper extended the known diversity and geographic distribution of phyllosilicates to include numerous Noachian craters. Phyllosilicates typically occur at the base of exposed ancient rock sections or in sediments in early Hesperian craters. It is uncertain whether the phyllosilicates developed in surface or subsurface aqueous environments and how long aqueous conditions persisted. Spirit rover found remarkably pure ferric sulfate, indicating oxidation and transport of Fe and S, perhaps in fumaroles or hot springs. Spirit also found opaline silica, consistent with hydrothermal activity. CRISM mapped extensive silica deposits in the Valles Marineris region, consistent with aqueous weathering and deposition. CRISM also found ultramafic rocks and magnesite at Nili Fossae, consistent with serpentinization, a process that can sustain habitable environments on Earth. The report of atmospheric methane implies subsurface aqueous conditions. A working hypothesis is that aqueous environments persisted in the near-subsurface for hundreds of millions of years and might exist even today. Studies of Mars-analog environments must better understand subsurface nonphotosynthetic ecosystems and their biosignatures in mafic and ultramafic terranes. Studies must determine minimum needs for water activity and energy and also establish survival limits when conditions that support active metabolism and propagation become progressively less frequent over time...|$|R

In the current study, our goal is to examine all released data from MGS MOC in the northern summer season, along with applicable TES data in order to better understand the albedo variations in the northern summer and their implications on water transport. To date, work has focused primarily on the MOC dataset. In 1999, data acquisition of the northern polar regions began at L(sub s) = 107, although there was little north polar data acquired from L(sub s) = 107 to L(sub s) = 109. We examined a total of 409 images from L(sub s) = 107 to L(sub s) = 148. We have also examined data from 2000 from L(sub s) = 93 to L(sub s) = 110; additional progress is ongoing. Here we present a progress report of our observations, and continue to determine their implications for the Martian water cycle...|$|R

40|$|NASA s Ice, Cloud, {{and land}} Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission [1, 2] {{carrying}} the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) Instrument, was launched on January 12, 2003. The three lasers on ICESat {{have made a}} total of 1. 98 billion laser shot measurements of the Earth s surface and atmosphere during its 17 science data collection campaigns over its seven year operating lifetime. ICESat completed its science mission after the last laser stopped operating in October 2009. The spacecraft was de-orbited on August 30, 2010. The GLAS instrument carried 3 diode-pumped Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers, which emitted 6 -nsec wide pulses at 1064 and 532 nm at a 40 -Hz rate. There are three lidar receiver channels, a 1064 nm surface altimetry channel, a 1064 nm cloud backscattering lidar channel, and a 532 nm cloud and aerosol backscattering lidar channel. The altimetry and cloud backscatter channels used Si avalanche photodiode (APD) operated in analog mode as in the Mars Global <b>Surveyor</b> <b>s</b> Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter [3, 4]. GLAS also utilized {{a number of new}} technologies and techniques for space lidar, including passively Q-switched diode-pumped Nd:YAG lasers, a 1 -m diameter telescope, a temperature tuned etalon optical bandpass filter, Si APD single photon counting detectors, 1 Gsample/sec waveform digitizers, ultra stable clock oscillators, and digital signal processing and detection algorithms [5]. A global position system (GPS) receiver was used to provide the spacecraft position and epoch times. The ICESat mission provided a unique opportunity to monitor the lidar component performance in the space environment over a multi-year time period. We performed a number of engineering tests periodically to monitor the lidar receiver performance, including receiver sensitivity, timing precision, detector dark noise, etc. A series of engineering tests were also performed {{after the end of the}} science mission to evaluate the performance of the spare detector, oscillator, waveform digitizer, and GPS receiver. An experiment was conducted which pointed GLAS to Venus to test the receiver sensitivity to star light and to verify GLAS bore sight with respect to the spacecraft coordinate system. These tests provided unique data to assess the degradation and the rate of change of these key lidar components due to space radiation and aging. They also helped to validate new techniques to operate and calibrate future space lidars...|$|R
