5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the two halves of its hooves to <b>splay</b> apart, and the clicking {{is the result of the}} hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.|$|E
5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{may also}} have used its neck to capture its prey via suction feeding. After flexing its neck to the side (which would have been {{facilitated}} by the slenderness of the cervical ribs), the act of straightening the neck would have caused the cervical ribs to <b>splay</b> outwards due to {{the action of the}} neck muscles attached to the ribs. As the head lunged forward, the volume of the esophagus would have increased, creating suction. Once the prey was caught, the fang-like teeth would have secured the prey in the mouth. Like other aquatic amniotes, Dinocephalosaurus would have swallowed and digested its prey head-first, as evinced by the preservation of a perleidid fish in the abdominal region of LPV 30280 from Luoping.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of <b>splayed</b> {{columnar}} pins on the vortex motion using realistic London Langevin simulations. At low currents vortex creep is strongly suppressed, whereas the critical current j_c is enhanced only moderately. <b>Splaying</b> the pins generates an increasing energy barrier against vortex hopping, and leads to the forced entanglement of vortices, both of which suppress creep efficiently. On the other hand <b>splaying</b> enhances kink nucleation and introduces intersecting pins, which cut off the energy barriers. Thus the j_c enhancement is strongly parameter sensitive. We also characterize the angle dependence of j_c, and the effect of different <b>splaying</b> geometries. Comment: 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Unconventional tough gas {{reservoirs}} in low-net-to-gross fluvial stratigraphic intervals may {{constitute a}} secondary source of fossil energy {{to prolong the}} gas supply in the future. To date, however, production from these thin-bedded, fine-grained reservoirs has been hampered by the economic risks associated with the uncertainties in their geometry, spatial distribution and reservoir properties. This study aims to provide a better insight into the reservoir architecture and tough gas reservoir potential of stacked and interconnected crevasse <b>splays</b> in a fluvial floodplain stratigraphy. Despite their thickness not exceeding decimetre scale, the surface area of individual crevasse <b>splays</b> may be up to several square kilometres and intervals of stacked and interconnected crevasse <b>splays</b> range up to several metres in thickness. Through incision of consecutive crevasse <b>splays</b> into underlying lobes and the channel fill of cut-through avulsed channels, sand-on-sand contact is established, effectively connecting individual <b>splays.</b> The net reservoir volume of single crevasse <b>splays</b> ranges up to several hundred thousand cubic metres, yielding GIIP estimations {{in the order of}} several million cubic metres. For intervals of stacked and interconnected crevasse <b>splays,</b> these figures are up to one order of magnitude higher, making them suitable as a secondary reservoir capacity.

40|$|Abstract. We study {{a natural}} {{generalization}} of transversally intersecting smooth hypersurfaces {{in a complex}} manifold: hypersurfaces, whose compo-nents intersect in a transversal way but may be themselves singular. Such hypersurfaces will be called <b>splayed</b> 1 divisors. A <b>splayed</b> divisor is charac-terized by a property of its Jacobian ideal. This yields an effective test for splayedness. Two further characterizations of a <b>splayed</b> divisor are shown, one reflecting the geometry of the intersection of its components, the other one us-ing K. Saito’s logarithmic derivations. As an application we prove that a union of smooth hypersurfaces has normal crossings {{if and only if}} it is a free divisor and has a radical Jacobian ideal. Further it is shown that the Hilbert–Samuel polynomials of <b>splayed</b> divisors satisfy the natural additivity property. 1...|$|R
40|$|Star <b>splaying</b> is a general-dimensional {{algorithm}} {{that takes}} as input a triangulation or an approximation of a convex hull, and produces the Delaunay triangulation, weighted Delaunay triangulation, or convex {{hull of the}} vertices in the input. If the input is “nearly Delaunay” or “nearly convex” {{in a certain sense}} quantified herein, and it is sparse (i. e. each input vertex adjoins only a constant number of edges), star <b>splaying</b> runs in time linear in the number of vertices. Thus, star <b>splaying</b> can be a fast first step in repairing a high-quality finite element mesh that has lost the Delaunay property after its vertices have moved in response to simulated physical forces. Star <b>splaying</b> is akin to Lawson’s edge flip algorithm for converting a triangulation to a Delaunay triangulation, but it works in any dimensionality...|$|R

25|$|Based on the {{sedimentary}} deposits at the site, the two Dreadnoughtus schrani specimens {{appear to}} have been buried quickly during a fluvial avulsion event, or break in a levee resulting in a flood. This event generated a liquefacted crevasse <b>splay</b> deposit which entombed the two dinosaurs. Thus, rapid and relatively deep burial of the Dreadnoughtus type specimen accounts for its extraordinary completeness. Numerous small theropod teeth found amongst the bones are likely evidence of scavenging, most likely by megaraptorans, perhaps Orkoraptor.|$|E
25|$|Splash : As {{its name}} {{suggests}} this pattern, or rather lack of pattern, {{occurs when the}} planets are randomly distributed around the chart in a 'splash'. A person with this pattern will have diversification as their number one asset, with a universal and enriching mental outlook on life.

25|$|<b>Splay</b> : This type of natal chart is {{noteworthy}} {{because of the}} presence of at least two, but usually three pairs (or conjunctions) of planets randomly distributed in a 'splay' shape around the chart. A person with this pattern will have enormous talent and potential that needs deliberate attention to be developed into worthwhile skills. The person will be an individualist, with no desire for a regimented or highly organized way of life, and they will seek to avoid becoming trapped in routine. However, there is often the difficulty that there is a lack of relevance between the different skill sets, so that the person may not derive the full benefit from them. Such a person needs to concentrate on 'getting their act together'.|$|E

25|$|Mount Ararat {{lies within}} a complex, sinistral {{pull-apart}} basin that originally was a single, continuous depression. The growth of Mount Ararat partitioned this depression into two smaller basins, the Iğdir and Doğubeyazıt basins. This pull-apart basin {{is the result}} of strike-slip movement along two en-echelon fault segments, the Doğubeyazıt–Gürbulak and Iğdir faults, of a sinistral strike–slip fault system. Tension between these faults, not only formed the original pull-apart basin, but created a system of faults, exhibiting a horsetail <b>splay</b> pattern, that control the position of the principal volcanic eruption centers of Mount Ararat and associated linear belt of parasitic volcanic cones. The strike-slip fault system within which Mount Ararat located {{is the result of}} north–south convergence and tectonic compression between the Arabian Platform and Laurasia that continued after the Tethys Ocean closed during the Eocene epoch along the Bitlis–Zagros suture.|$|E
25|$|Some paleontologists have {{doubted the}} biplane hypothesis, and have {{proposed}} other configurations. A 2010 study by Alexander et al. described {{the construction of}} a lightweight three-dimensional physical model used to perform glide tests. Using several hindleg configurations for the model, they found that the biplane model, while not unreasonable, was structurally deficient and needed a heavy-headed weight distribution for stable gliding, which they deemed unlikely. The study indicated that a laterally abducted hindwing structure represented the most biologically and aerodynamically consistent configuration for Microraptor. A further analysis by Brougham and Brusatte, however, concluded that Alexander's model reconstruction was not consistent with all of the available data on Microraptor and argued that the study was insufficient for determining a likely flight pattern for Microraptor. Brougham and Brusatte criticized the anatomy of the model used by Alexander and his team, noting that the hip anatomy was not consistent with other dromaeosaurs. In most dromaeosaurids, features of the hip bone prevent the legs from splaying horizontally; instead, they are locked in a vertical position below the body. Alexander's team used a specimen of Microraptor which was crushed flat to make their model, which Brougham and Brusatte argued did not reflect its actual anatomy. Later in 2010, Alexander's team responded to these criticisms, noting that the related dromaeosaur Hesperonychus, which is known from complete hip bones preserved in three dimensions, also shows hip sockets directed partially upward, possibly allowing the legs to <b>splay</b> more than in other dromaeosaurs.|$|E
500|$|Some {{aesthetic}} improvements {{were made}} as well. The building now features a [...] park in its open-to-the-sky central courtyard. Most of the courtyard's concrete was removed and trees, shrubs, and flowers planted to absorb rainwater. The park, {{which is now}} no longer accessible by the public, also includes a very large granite abstract art sculpture ("Legacy") by Richard Deutsch. The sculpture is meant to reflect the original facade of the building by Edward Durrell Stone {{as well as the}} memory of David Nassif, Sr. and his son, David Nassif, Jr. The L'Enfant Plaza Metro station still has an entrance under the building on D Street SW (although this entrance closed between October 2007 and July 2008 for the building's reconstruction).

500|$|In this formalism, {{a liquid}} crystal {{material}} {{is treated as}} a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the Frank free energy density. One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) twists of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) <b>splay</b> of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) bend of the material, where the distortion {{is parallel to the}} director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions. Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling liquid crystal devices [...] and lipid bilayers.|$|E

The 'A' has a flat top. Many lowercase letters show subtle, sinuous curves; the termination of the arm of both the r and the e flare slightly upward and outward.

In italic, the k has an elegantly curved stroke in the lower-right and descenders on the p, q and y end with a flat horizontal stroke. In the 1950s, Monotype noted that its features included: [...] "serifs fine slab, fine-bracketed and in l.c. prolonged to right along baseline." [...] This meant that many of the serifs (especially the horizontals, for example on the W) are fine lines of quite uniform width, rather than forming an obvious curve leading into the main form of the letter.
