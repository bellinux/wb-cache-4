5|$|The 1991 {{release of}} Forest of Equilibrium, the debut album by UK band Cathedral, helped <b>spark</b> <b>a</b> {{new wave of}} doom metal. During the same period, the doom-death fusion style of British bands Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, and Anathema gave rise to European gothic metal, with its {{signature}} dual-vocalist arrangements, exemplified by Norway's Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania. New York's Type O Negative introduced an American take on the style.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev {{approved}} the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan (see also Soviet–Afghan relations) {{just as he}} had previously {{approved the}} Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. In both cases, Brezhnev was not the one pushing hardest for a possible armed intervention. Several leading members of the Soviet leadership decided to retain Brezhnev as General Secretary so that their careers would not suffer by a possible leadership reshuffling by his successor. Other members, who disliked Brezhnev, among them Dmitriy Ustinov (Minister of Defence), Andrei Gromyko (Minister of Foreign Affairs), and Mikhail Suslov (Central Committee Secretary), feared that Brezhnev's removal would <b>spark</b> <b>a</b> succession crisis, and so they helped to maintain the status quo.|$|E
5|$|Martin Wolf, an {{economics}} leader writer with the Financial Times, suggested {{there may be}} advantages in western economies taking a more confrontational approach against China, which in recent years had been {{by far the biggest}} practitioner of competitive devaluation. Though he advised that rather than using protectionist measures which may <b>spark</b> <b>a</b> trade war, a better tactic would be to use targeted capital controls against China to prevent them buying foreign assets in order to further devalue the yuan, as previously suggested by Daniel Gros, Director of the Centre for European Policy Studies.|$|E

5|$|Castro stockpiled {{weapons for}} a planned {{attack on the}} Moncada Barracks, a {{military}} garrison outside Santiago de Cuba, Oriente. Castro's militants intended to dress in army uniforms and arrive at the base on July 25, the festival of St James, when many officers would be away. The rebels would seize control, raid the armory and escape before reinforcements arrived. Supplied with new weaponry, Castro intended to arm supporters and <b>spark</b> <b>a</b> revolution among Oriente's impoverished cane cutters. The plan was to then seize control of a Santiago radio station, broadcasting the Movement's manifesto, hence promoting further uprisings. Castro's plan emulated those of the 19th century Cuban independence fighters who had raided Spanish barracks; Castro saw himself as the heir to independence leader and national hero José Martí.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{deaths from}} {{smallpox}} often changed dynastic succession. The only surviving son of Henry VIII, Edward VI, died from complications shortly after apparently {{recovering from the}} disease, thereby nullifying Henry's efforts to ensure a male successor to the throne (his two immediate successors were both women, who had both had it and survived). Louis XV of France succeeded his great-grandfather Louis XIV {{through a series of}} deaths of smallpox or measles among those earlier in the succession line. He himself died of the disease in 1774. William III lost his mother to the disease when he was only ten years old in 1660, and named his uncle Charles as legal guardian: her death from smallpox would indirectly <b>spark</b> <b>a</b> chain of events that would eventually lead to the permanent ousting of the Stuart line from the British throne. William III's wife, Mary II of England, died from smallpox as well.|$|E

The Silurians cause holes {{to open in the}} earth, one of which consumes Amy. The Doctor and Rory capture one Silurian, Alaya (Neve McIntosh), and the Doctor instructs Rory and a local family to not harm Alaya, as it could <b>spark</b> <b>a</b> war. He then takes Nasreen in the TARDIS to the Silurian civilisation to rescue Amy and a local boy.|$|E

5|$|Land mine: Textual {{evidence}} suggests that the first use of a land mine in history was by a Song Dynasty brigadier general known as Lou Qianxia, who used an 'enormous bomb' (huo pao) to kill Mongol soldiers invading Guangxi in 1277. However, the first detailed description of the land mine was given in the Huolongjing text written by Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the late Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) and early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Jiao and Liu wrote that land mines were spherical, made of cast iron, and their fuses ignited by a mechanism tripped by enemy movement; although Jiao and Liu did not describe this trip mechanism in full detail, a later text of 1606 revealed that enemy movement released a pin that allowed hidden underground weights to fall and spin a chord around an axle that rotated a spinning wheel acting as a flint to <b>spark</b> <b>a</b> train of fuses.|$|E
5|$|Mindaugas then {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with Alexander Nevsky of Novgorod and marched against the Order. Treniota led an army to Cēsis and battled Masovia, hoping to encourage all the conquered Baltic tribes to rise up against the Orders and unite under Lithuanian leadership. He waged successful battles, but did not manage to capture the fortified castles or <b>spark</b> <b>a</b> coalition of Baltic forces against the Order. His personal influence grew because Mindaugas was concentrating on the conquest of Russian lands, dispatching a large army to Bryansk. Treniota and Mindaugas began to pursue different priorities. In the midst of these events, Mindaugas' wife Morta died, and Mindaugas expressed the wish to marry Daumantas' wife. Daumantas and Treniota responded to this insult by assassinating Mindaugas {{and two of his}} sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, in 1263. Lithuania lapsed into years of internal instability.|$|E
5|$|On February 18, 1898, Muñoz Rivera's son, Luis Muñoz Marín, was born. By {{this time}} the family had moved to Old San Juan, where Luis was born. On February 16, 1898, Barbosa rushed to Muñoz Rivera's home. He had just learned that the American vessel USS Maine had sunk {{off the coast of}} Cuba, which would most likely <b>spark</b> <b>a</b> war between Spain and the United States. Barbosa {{expected}} the American government to grant Puerto Rico autonomy if they gained control. However, Muñoz Rivera was saddened by the news, knowing that the United States was planning to build a canal in Panama, and that Puerto Rico would be a strategic location to protect the structure. Barbosa insisted that this would not happen, continuing his support towards a military operation.|$|E

5|$|William de Braose (c. 1260–1326) was {{the second}} Baron Braose, as well as Lord of Gower and Lord of Bramber. He was held as a hostage after being {{captured}} in 1264 during the Second Barons' War and records {{of some of his}} childhood expenses survive from his time as a hostage. He first entered royal service in 1286 and, in 1291, he succeeded his father as baron. He continued in royal military service, serving in Scotland as well as in Wales. Protracted disputes over his lands embroiled him throughout his life {{and at the end of}} his life helped <b>spark</b> <b>a</b> revolt against King Edward II of England's favourites, the Despensers. He married twice, and his heirs were his daughter Aline and his grandson John de Bohun.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Westley signed a three-year {{contract}} extension at Stevenage that kept him contracted to the club until 2014. Westley acquired five players on free transfers, while also releasing five of the existing squad. Stevenage started their first ever League One campaign well, beating the 2010–11 League One play-off semi-finalists, Bournemouth, 3–1 at Dean Court to secure their first victory of the season on 16 August 2011. Stevenage were exceeding expectations in the third tier of English football, sitting just outside the play-off places after securing a notable 5–1 victory against Sheffield Wednesday Broadhall Way in September 2011. The club also inflicted Charlton Athletic's first league defeat of the season after a 1–0 win against the league leaders. The victory against Charlton was to <b>spark</b> <b>a</b> 13-game unbeaten run for Westley's Stevenage, and a 6–1 away victory at Colchester United on Boxing Day 2011 meant the club were sat in sixth place, the final play-off position. After managing Stevenage for three-and-a-half years, Westley left Stevenage in January 2012, joining fellow League One side Preston North End. His final game as manager of Stevenage was a 1–0 away victory at Reading in the FA Cup Third Round.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its strongest possible team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Barnes opened with Morris, while reserve opener Brown batted out of position in the middle order. The hosts won the toss and batted first, and Barnes took the last two catches as Australia dismissed them for 233. He delivered nine overs with his leg spin and was the most economical Australian bowler, conceding ten runs without taking a wicket. When Australia batted, Barnes made 44 from 104 balls in 99 minutes before being the first batsman to fall at 1/79.N- Australia reached 462 and dismissed the hosts for 212 to complete a victory by an innings and 17 runs. During the second innings, Barnes took his first wicket for the tour, having Laddy Outschoorn caught behind by Don Tallon to <b>spark</b> <b>a</b> collapse that saw the home side lose their last five wickets for 47 runs. Barnes ended with 1/25 and took two catches in the second innings; all four of his catches for the match were from spinners.|$|E

5|$|His exile over, Vladimir {{was banned}} from Saint Petersburg, instead {{settling}} in Pskov, {{a small town}} two hours' train ride from the capital, in February 1900. His wife, who had not served the entirety of her sentence, remained in exile in Ufa, where she fell ill. Intent on founding a newspaper, Vladimir and Struve raised money for the publication of Iskra (The <b>Spark),</b> <b>a</b> new organ of the Russian Marxist movement, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). After visiting his wife, on 29 July 1900, Vladimir left Russia for Western Europe. In Switzerland and Germany, he met with Axelrod, Plekhanov and Potresov, and lectured on the Russian situation. On 24 August 1900, a conference of Russian Marxists {{was held in the}} Swiss town of Corsier to discuss Iskra, but both Vladimir and Potresov were shocked at Plekhanov's controlling nature and antisemitism. It was agreed that the paper would be produced in Munich, where Vladimir moved in September 1900. The first issue was printed on Christmas Eve, and contained an article written by Vladimir decrying European intervention in the Boxer Rebellion. A second RSDLP publication, Zarya, appeared in March 1901, and would run for four issues, but Iskra was far more successful, being smuggled into Russia illegally, becoming the most successful Russian underground publication for 50 years. It contained contributions from such figures as the Polish Rosa Luxemburg, the Czech-German Karl Kautsky, and a young Ukrainian Marxist, Leon Trotsky, who became a regular contributor from the autumn of 1902.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to moving}} its {{headquarters}} to Chicago, aerospace manufacturer Boeing (#30) {{was the largest}} company based in Seattle. Its largest division is still headquartered in nearby Renton, and the company has large aircraft manufacturing plants in Everett and Renton, so it remains the largest private employer in the Seattle metropolitan area. Former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to <b>spark</b> <b>a</b> new economic boom driven by the biotechnology industry in 2006. Major redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood is underway, {{in an effort to}} attract new and established biotech companies to the city, joining biotech companies Corixa (acquired by GlaxoSmithKline), Immunex (now part of Amgen), Trubion, and ZymoGenetics. Vulcan Inc., the holding company of billionaire Paul Allen, is behind most of the development projects in the region. While some see the new development as an economic boon, others have criticized Nickels and the Seattle City Council for pandering to Allen's interests at taxpayers' expense. Also in 2006, Expansion Magazine ranked Seattle among the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation for climates favorable to business expansion. In 2005, Forbes ranked Seattle as the most expensive American city for buying a house based on the local income levels. In 2013, however, the magazine ranked Seattle No. 9 on its list of the Best Places for Business and Careers.|$|E
5|$|The Ark, also {{referred}} to as Installation 00, is located outside the Milky Way galaxy and serves as the construction and control station for the Halo weapon system. It does not share the ringworld geometry of the other installations. During Halo 3, the Covenant discover a portal on Earth that leads to the Ark and are pursued by the humans and a breakaway faction of Covenant opposed to activating the rings. Gravemind, having hijacked High Charity, crash-lands on the installation. The remote firing of the rings is halted by Master Chief and the Arbiter. In order to end the threat of the Flood, Master Chief decides to activate Installation 04B under construction in The Ark, the replacement for the Halo that he destroyed in Halo: Combat Evolved. Unknown to everyone but 343 Guilty <b>Spark,</b> <b>a</b> premature firing would destroy the installation; the monitor attempted to defend 'his' ring but was destroyed by Master Chief, who proceeded to fire the weapon. The firing tears apart the incomplete Halo and severely damages The Ark as Master Chief, Cortana, and the Arbiter try to escape through the Portal, which closes as they enter, leaving Master Chief and Cortana drifting in space while the Arbiter returns to Earth successfully. The Ark appears in other Halo novels and the video game Halo Wars 2.|$|E
