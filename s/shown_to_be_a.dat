5|$|Another early {{application}} of functional graphs {{is in the}} trains used to study Steiner triple systems. The train of a triple system is a functional graph having a vertex for each possible triple of symbols; each triple pqr is mapped by ƒ to stu, where pqs, prt, and qru are the triples that belong to the triple system and contain the pairs pq, pr, and qr respectively. Trains have been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> powerful invariant of triple systems although somewhat cumbersome to compute.|$|E
5|$|Another sauropod of the Nemegt-Formation, Nemegtosaurus, {{is known}} {{only from a}} skull. Opisthocoelicaudia, on the other hand, lacks both the skull and neck, precluding a direct {{comparison}} and leading to suspicions that it may represent a synonym of Nemegtosaurus. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the oldest name has priority over younger synonyms – if Opisthocoelicaudia would be <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> synonym of Nemegtosaurus, the name Nemegtosaurus would remain valid while Opisthocoelicaudia would become invalid.|$|E

He meets Al, and the pair join the group. He had relatives in Blackburn but doesn't know if they survived the pandemic. <b>Shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> friendly, considerate child, Najid is adopted into the group with the most ease and forms especially close bonds with Abby and Al.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{disturbed}} by the box of Mr. Sparkle, contacts the manufacturer in Hokkaidō, Japan for information. He is sent a promotional video for Mr. Sparkle, which consists of a TV commercial. At {{the end of the}} video, the mascot is <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> result of a joint venture between two large Japanese conglomerates, Matsumura Fishworks and Tamaribuchi Heavy Manufacturing Concern. Their mascots, a smiling anime fish and light bulb, merge to form Mr. Sparkle. Thus, Homer discovers the similarity was a mere coincidence.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the {{discovery}} of Bugtilemur, a fossil primate from Pakistan dating to the Oligocene and initially {{thought to be a}} cheirogaleid lemur, further challenged the theory of lemur origins; however, it was later <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> type of adapiform primate and not a lemur.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{researchers}} in the field focus on development of cognitive flexibility {{between the ages of}} three and five. However, cognitive flexibility has been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> broad concept that can be studied with all different ages and situations. Thus, with tasks ranging from simple to more complex, research suggests that there is a developmental continuum that spans from infancy to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Permanent seed {{implantation}} {{is suitable}} for patients with a localised tumour and good prognosis and has been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> highly effective treatment to prevent the cancer from returning. The survival rate {{is similar to that}} found with EBRT or surgery (radical prostatectomy), but with fewer side effects such as impotence and incontinence. The procedure can be completed quickly and patients are usually able to go home on the same day of treatment and return to normal activities after 1 to 2 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{of these}} patients is grim with untreated patients having an extremely short survival. The severity of liver disease (as evidenced by the MELD score) has been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> determinant of outcome. Some patients without cirrhosis develop HRS, with an incidence of about 20% seen in one study of ill patients with alcoholic hepatitis.|$|E

5|$|These new finds {{have been}} vital in {{illustrating}} {{the origins of}} horned dinosaurs in general, suggesting an Asian origin in the Jurassic, {{and the appearance of}} truly horned ceratopsians {{by the beginning of the}} late Cretaceous in North America. As Triceratops is increasingly <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> member of the long-frilled Ceratopsinae subfamily, a likely ancestor may have resembled Chasmosaurus, which thrived some 5 million years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine has been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious colour {{differences}} between crested and marbled newts, {{species in the}} genus also have different body forms. They range from stocky with sturdy limbs in the Anatolian, Balkan and the southern crested newt {{as well as the}} marbled newts, to very slender with short legs in the Danube crested newt. These types were first noted by herpetologist Willy Wolterstorff, who used the ratio of forelimb length to distance between fore- and hindlimbs to distinguish subspecies of the crested newt (now full species); this index however sometimes leads to misidentifications. The number of rib-bearing vertebrae in the skeleton was <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better species indicator. It ranges from 12 in the marbled newts to 16–17 in the Danube crested newt and is usually observed through radiography on dead or sedated specimens.|$|E

5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) has been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> transition metal, {{it is expected that}} all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E
5|$|Himmler's {{personal}} masseur Felix Kersten {{claimed that}} the former even contemplated resettling the entire Dutch population, some 8 million people in total at the time, to agricultural lands in the Vistula and Bug River valleys of German-occupied Poland as {{the most efficient way}} of facilitating their immediate Germanization. In this eventuality he is alleged to have further hoped to establish an SS Province of Holland in vacated Dutch territory, and to distribute all confiscated Dutch property and real estate among reliable SS-men. However this claim was <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> myth by Loe de Jong in his book Two Legends of the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Sanford Myron Zeller {{circumscribed}} the {{new family}} Mycenastraceae, containing both Mycenastrum as the type genus, and Bovista. A 2001 molecular study supported {{the inclusion of}} Mycenastrum corium in the Lycoperdales, where it was traditionally placed. In a more recent (2008) cladistic analysis, Mycenastrum was <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sister group to the Lycoperdaceae; authors Larsson and Jeppson agreed with Zeller (1949) and Pilat's (1958) decision to regard Mycenastrium as a monotypic genus in the separate family Mycenastraceae. Despite this, several taxonomic authorities prefer to fold Mycenastraceae into the Agaricaceae.|$|E

5|$|In November 1940, Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{was sent}} to the Naval Gunnery School at Wik to {{complete}} his heavy gun training courses, which ended his position as Lindemann's personal adjutant. Lindemann's new adjutant was the signals officer Second Lieutenant Wolfgang Reiner. Bismarcks heavy guns were first test-fired {{in the second half of}} November, and Bismarck was <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very stable gun platform. After the 1940 Christmas celebration on board, Lindemann and the majority of the officers, non-commissioned officers and sailors went on home leave. First gunnery officer Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider relieved Lindemann as Bismarcks commander during his absence. Lindemann spent his leave with his wife and daughter and returned on 1 January 1941.|$|E
5|$|Introduced as Billie Jenkins's long-lost sister, she {{secretly}} collaborates {{with the}} demonic council {{known as the}} Triad with their plans to destroy the Charmed Ones. She eventually convinces Billie that the Charmed Ones are corrupt, and use their power to fulfill their own personal desires, rather than help for the greater good. Billie kills Christy in self-defense after being unable to convince her to understand the Halliwell sisters were good, and to return home with her. Throughout season eight, Christy is <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> powerful witch with a mastery of her powers of telepathy and pyrokinesis. She is also called the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her connection with Billie, who is prophesied to be the Ultimate Power. Christy is referenced in canonical Charmed material such as comic books and novels.|$|E
