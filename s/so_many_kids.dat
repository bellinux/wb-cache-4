60|$|Directly {{the full}} force of the {{hurricane}} had struck the ship, every part of her deck became untenable; and the sailors, dazed and dismayed, took shelter in the port alleyway under the bridge. It had a door aft, which they shut; it was very black, cold, and dismal. At each heavy fling of the ship they would groan all together in the dark, and tons of water could be heard scuttling about as if trying to get at them from above. The boatswain had been keeping up a gruff talk, but a more unreasonable lot of men, he said afterwards, he had never been with. They were snug enough there, out of harm's way, and not wanted to do anything, either; and yet they did nothing but grumble and complain peevishly like <b>so</b> <b>many</b> sick <b>kids.</b> Finally, one of them said that if there had been at least some light to see each other's noses by, it wouldn't be so bad. It was making him crazy, he declared, to lie there in the dark waiting for the blamed hooker to sink.|$|R

A terrible pain spread throughout his leg as he rolled in agonized slow motion on the field. It was now impossible to move. All his future plans imploded. Struggling with dyslexia for years, it had become painfully obvious to Rickie that he would be lucky to graduate from high school. <b>So,</b> like <b>many</b> <b>kids</b> who suffer academic humiliation, he had hoped to go to college on an athletic scholarship. But now, these were broken dreams, and that hurt more than the knee. He did manage to get back on his feet, but Rickie would never go to college. As he battled toward a high school diploma, his headmaster said, ‘I predict that you will either go to prison or become a millionaire. ’” Why did the headmaster predict such extremes? What were the clues? And, why was the headmaster unable to provide a more accurate future? Was high potential evident? Or, just something out of the ordinary? How could the headmaster accurately predict ultimate success? These are the questions we grapple with in our attempts to predict leadership potential. Rickie in this story is Richard Branson of a company named Virgin. The story is found in the book Success Built to Last by Porras, Emery and Thompson...|$|R

You can tell that, up until now, his world has been small, and he might well have spiraled down the sinkhole that swallows <b>so</b> <b>many</b> marginalised estate <b>kids.</b> Eventually, however, Bugg comes to the same conclusion that we do: [...] "Something is changing, changing, changing".

5000|$|Shortland Street {{is often}} used by {{producers}} {{as a tool to}} tackle large issues in a method to provide drama and character development.

Bloomfield did not wish for Rachel to be seen as a role model, citing her anger, [...] "she resorts to some really bad excuses for getting angry." [...] Storylines surrounding Rachel's reluctance to accept her maternal nature were often dealt with, Bloomfield explained, [...] "I know she likes children, but ... she'll disguise it with a sarcastic remark. You would only see it when she's alone with the child." [...] In 2009 Rachel returned with what Bloomfield described as an [...] "anti-children" [...] sentiment but following her relationship with Chris, accepted his sons into her life.
