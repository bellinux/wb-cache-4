50|$|This {{explains}} how abnormally elevated somatostatin can cause diabetes mellitus, by inhibiting insulin secretion, <b>steatorrhoea</b> by inhibiting cholecystokinin and secretin, gall stones by inhibiting cholecystokinin which normally induce gallbladder myocytes to contract, and hypochlorhydria caused by inhibiting gastrin, which normally stimulate acid secretion.|$|E
5000|$|Diarrhoea, often <b>steatorrhoea,</b> is {{the most}} common feature. Watery, diurnal and nocturnal, bulky, {{frequent}} stools are the clinical hallmark of overt malabsorption. It is due to impaired water, carbohydrate and electrolyte absorption or irritation from unabsorbed fatty acid. The latter also results in bloating, flatulence and abdominal discomfort. Cramping pain usually suggests obstructive intestinal segment e.g. in Crohn's disease, especially if it persists after defecation.|$|E
50|$|Somatostatinoma is a {{malignant}} tumor {{of the delta}} cells of the endocrine pancreas that produces somatostatin. Increased levels of somatostatin inhibit pancreatic hormones and gastrointestinal hormones. Thus somatostatinomas are associated with mild diabetes mellitus (due to inhibition of insulin release), <b>steatorrhoea</b> and gallstones (due to inhibition of cholecystokinin release), and achlorhydria (due to inhibition of gastrin release). Somatostatinomas are commonly found in head of pancreas.|$|E
50|$|The classic {{symptoms}} of coeliac disease include pale, loose, and greasy stool (<b>steatorrhoea)</b> {{and weight loss}} or failure to gain weight. More common symptoms are subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself. It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any classic symptoms whatsoever. This represents at least in 43% of the cases in children. Many adults with subtle disease only have fatigue or anaemia.|$|E
50|$|Steatorrhea (or <b>steatorrhoea)</b> is the {{presence}} of excess fat in feces. Stools may be bulky and difficult to flush, have a pale and oily appearance and can be especially foul-smelling. An oily anal leakage or some level of fecal incontinence may occur. There is increased fat excretion, which can be measured by determining the fecal fat level. The definition of how much fecal fat constitutes steatorrhea has not been standardized.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the less}} {{significant}} adverse effects of laxative abuse include dehydration, hypotension, tachycardia, postural dizziness and syncope; however, laxative abuse can lead to potentially fatal acid-base and electrolyte imbalances. For example, severe hypokalaemia {{has been associated with}} distal renal tubular acidosis from laxative abuse. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base imbalance observed. Other significant adverse effects include rhabdomyolysis, <b>steatorrhoea,</b> inflammation and ulceration of colonic mucosa, pancreatitis, renal failure, factitious diarrhea and other problems.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a whole {{pancreas}} preparation (Viokase) has been investigated in 11 patients with pancreatic <b>steatorrhoea</b> and in five patients with <b>steatorrhoea</b> due to other causes. The appearance of the stool, faecal fat, and stool and blood radioactivity after a given dose of I 131 triolein (Raolein) were employed in assessing the response to Viokase therapy. Pancreatic <b>steatorrhoea</b> was considerably improved {{in the majority of}} patients, and showed some improvement in the remainder. Viokase appeared to be of limited value in the treatment of post-gastrectomy <b>steatorrhoea,</b> and failed to influence fat absorption in <b>steatorrhoea</b> due to disorder of the small intestine...|$|E
40|$|On a 'normal' diet {{increased}} faecal {{bile acid}} excretion {{was found in}} 14 of 16 children with cystic fibrosis who had <b>steatorrhoea,</b> but excretion was normal in 2 such children without <b>steatorrhoea.</b> The 16 children with <b>steatorrhoea</b> took 3 regimens of diet and therapy: a 'normal' diet with pancreatic enzyme supplements, a diet of reduced long-chain triglycerides with added medium-chain triglycerides, and the same diet with added pancreatic enzyme supplements. On {{each of these three}} regimens <b>steatorrhoea</b> and faecal bile acid loss were significantly less than on no treatment, with the lowest excretions occurring on the diet of reduced long-chain triglycerides with added medium-chain triglycerides and pancreatic enzyme supplements. Although a reduction in <b>steatorrhoea</b> was nearly always accompanied by a decrease in bile acid excretion, the initial bile acid loss was very variable and could not be predicted for any given degree of <b>steatorrhoea.</b> This suggests that at least one other factor, possibly liver disease or bile acid pool size, influences bile acid loss in the faeces...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} serum cationic trypsinogen as {{a marker}} of exocrine pancreatic function in children without cystic fibrosis. The ability of this test to determine <b>steatorrhoea</b> of pancreatic origin, {{and its relationship to}} a wide range of exocrine pancreatic function were assessed. Serum trypsinogen was measured in 32 children with <b>steatorrhoea,</b> 10 with pancreatic and 22 with non-pancreatic causes. In patients with pancreatic <b>steatorrhoea,</b> serum cationic trypsinogen was 4 · 9 ± 4 · 9 μg/l (mean ±SD), significantly below values in patients with non-pancreatic <b>steatorrhoea</b> (47 · 0 ± 22 · 1 μg/l, p< 0 · 001) and 50 control subjects (31 · 4 ± 7 · 4 μg/l, p< 0 · 001). Serum cationic trypsinogen values in patients with pancreatic <b>steatorrhoea</b> all fell below the lower limit of our control range and below all values for patients with non-pancreatic <b>steatorrhoea.</b> Serum cationic trypsinogen was also evaluated against pancreatic trypsin output in 47 patients (range 0 · 2 - 17 · 0 yr) who underwent a hormonal pancreatic stimulation test. In 17 patients, serum cationic trypsinogen was low (<- 2 SD or 16 · 6 μg/l), and associated with greatly impaired pancreatic trypsin output, ranging from 0 - 8 % of mean normal trypsin output. Five of these 17 patients did not have <b>steatorrhoea.</b> In 30 patients with normal or raised serum cationic trypsinogen (≥ 16 · 6 μg/l), pancreatic trypsin output ranged from 15 - 183 % of mean normal values. In conclusion, low serum cationic trypsinogen suggests severely impaired exocrine pancreatic function, with sensitivity extending above the steatorrhoeic threshold. In the presence of <b>steatorrhoea,</b> low serum cationic trypsinogen indicates a pancreatic aetiology. Normal serum cationic trypsinogen, however, does not exclude impaired pancreatic function, above the steatorrhoeic threshold...|$|E

40|$|EDITORIAL SYNOPSIS This series {{presents}} {{further evidence}} for {{an association between}} reticulosis of the intestine and <b>steatorrhoea.</b> Although some patients have a definite past history of gluten entero-pathy, {{it seems likely that}} in certain patients the reticulosis itself is the primary cause of the <b>steatorrhoea.</b> For 25 years after the account by Fairley and Mackie (1937) of a sprue-like syndrome occurring in patients with intestinal reticuloses, the latter were accepted as a rare cause of secondary steatorr-hoea. Ten years ago Sleisenger, Almy, and Barr (1953) reviewed the literature and described four patients of their own all of whom they considered to be suffering from secondary <b>steatorrhoea.</b> In 1962 Gough, Read, and Naish considered these and later case reports and added three of their own. They {{came to the conclusion that}} many were cases of idiopathic <b>steatorrhoea</b> which had developed reticu-losis as a late complication. Current interest in the association between reticulosis and <b>steatorrhoea</b> is reflected in the reports of 11 cases which have appeared during the past two years bringing the total number to just under forty...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{case report}} {{illustrating}} a disorder of small intestine motility producing gross muscular hypertrophy and associated with <b>steatorrhoea.</b> The literature is briefly reviewed, and {{it is suggested that}} in idiopathic <b>steatorrhoea</b> there is ineffectual peristalsis which leads to stagnation of intestinal contents and hypertrophy of its muscular wall...|$|E
40|$|In 100 {{patients}} with cystic fibrosis {{the severity of}} <b>steatorrhoea</b> was assessed by three separate methods. Using chemical faecal fat assay as the gold standard, two other rapid and inexpensive methods were compared with it. The steatocrit method proved unreliable in our hands and gave little indication of the presence or severity of <b>steatorrhoea.</b> The more simple microscopy method was highly sensitive (97 %) and only three of 80 {{patients with}} <b>steatorrhoea</b> were missed. All patients with severe <b>steatorrhoea</b> (greater than 60 mmol fat/day) were clearly demonstrated. The method is applicable to spot faecal samples and can readily be carried out on an outpatient basis. In centres where faecal fat assays are not available, the simple and cheap microscopic examination will give some indication of the response to enzyme treatment and may also help to identify non-compliant individuals...|$|E
40|$|A {{child who}} {{presented}} at age 9 months with <b>steatorrhoea</b> and malnutrition is described. After an initial period of intravenous feeding {{it was found}} that oral gentamicin led to a reduction of clinical <b>steatorrhoea</b> and an increase in weight, and so gentamicin was continued for 18 months. Investigation showed severe villous atrophy without pronounced inflammatory cell infiltrate and with no increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. The villous atrophy was not present in the duodenum but started in the jejunum. The small-intestine was radiologically dilated throughout its length. It is suggested that this structurally-abnormal gut acted as a stagnant loop and exacerbated the <b>steatorrhoea...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Nile blue {{test for}} the {{detection}} of <b>steatorrhoea</b> has been compared with the estimation of 24 -hour faecal excretion by the method of Weijers and Van der Kamer modified by Anderson, Frazer, French, Gerrard, Simmons, and Smellie (1952). The Nile blue test is easily and quickly carried out. A positive result was only found in cases showing a considerable degree of <b>steatorrhoea</b> but it was often negative when the excretion of fat was abnormally high. This test appears to be of considerable use as a rapid, semiquantitative screening test in the investigation of possible cases of <b>steatorrhoea...</b>|$|E
40|$|Jejunal {{perfusion}} {{studies were}} performed to assess water, electrolyte, d-xylose, and d-glucose transport in 16 patients with chronic calcific pancreatitis (eight with and eight without <b>steatorrhoea)</b> and in 10 control subjects. The patients with <b>steatorrhoea</b> demonstrated significantly less xylose, water, and electrolyte absorption than patients without <b>steatorrhoea</b> and control subjects, when an isosmotic slaine-xylose solution was perfused. On the other hand, when an isosmotic saline-glucose solution was perfused, the patients with <b>steatorrhoea</b> absorbed significantly more glucose, water, and electrolytes than control subjects. Significant correlation was demonstrated between the absorption of xylose {{as measured by the}} segmental perfusion technique and the peak serum xylose level during perfusion as well as the five-hour urinary xylose excretion after a 25 g oral dose of xylose. The xylose absorption measured by small bowel perfusion also correlated significantly with pancreatic juice amylase and trypsin concentrations obtained during a standard pancreatic function test...|$|E

The aetiological role of Gram-positive anaerobic microbes, especially Clostridium welchii, is suggested...|$|E
40|$|The Pancreolauryl Test (PLT), a {{tubeless}} pancreatic function test, {{has been}} evaluated in an unselected series of outpatients with <b>steatorrhoea</b> presenting to a district general hospital (DGH). This {{is the first}} study of the PLT in a DGH, involving an unselected series of patients and not those from secondary or tertiary referral hospitals. Health controls (n = 15) and patients with self-limiting diarrhoea (n = 8) had normal urinary excretion indices (greater {{than or equal to}} 30). Coeliac disease (n = 13) and small bowel bacterial overgrowth (n = 12) were the commonest causes of <b>steatorrhoea</b> and there were no false-positive results in these patients. The mean urinary excretion index in patients with untreated coeliac disease (mean index = 38 %) was lower than in healthy controls (n = 15, mean index = 53 %; P less than 0. 05 greater than 0. 02). No patient with proven pancreatic <b>steatorrhoea</b> had a normal PLT result, confirming the high negative predictive value found by others. Low results in patients with <b>steatorrhoea</b> following gastric surgery indicate poor mixing of food with pancreatic juices. The PLT proved to be a simple, inexpensive and noninvasive outpatient screening test suitable for use in a DGH to exclude a pancreatic origin of <b>steatorrhoea...</b>|$|E
40|$|Six {{patients}} with hyperphagia (ingestion of 5 - 11 000 Kcals/day) associated with severe malabsorption and <b>steatorrhoea</b> are described. The {{cause of the}} malabsorption was coeliac disease in three patients, Crohn's disease with ileal resection in two, and carcinoma of the pancreas in one patient. There {{was no evidence of}} neurological or endocrine disease (apart from mild diabetes mellitus in the patient with carcinoma of the pancreas) but three patients suffered from severe depression. This association may be commoner than previously realized and be revealed in {{patients with}} <b>steatorrhoea</b> of unexplained severity by careful dietary assessment. Its detection has therapeutic implications since restriction of caloric and fat intake decreased <b>steatorrhoea</b> without weight loss in several of the patients described...|$|E
40|$|A {{defect in}} colonic {{absorption}} of electrolytes and water was demonstrated {{in patients with}} tropical sprue by perfusing the colon with normal saline containing a non-absorbable marker. Colonic water absorption correlated negatively with stool weight and was abnormal in patients with <b>steatorrhoea.</b> The possible mechanisms producing this defect are discussed. This defect {{may be related to}} colonocyte damage produced by unabsorbed unsaturated fatty acids in patients with <b>steatorrhoea...</b>|$|E
40|$|By {{the use of}} gas-liquid {{chromatography}} {{it has been shown}} that the quality of the faecal fat in individuals without <b>steatorrhoea</b> is little affected by changes in the quality of the dietary fat.

40|$|Two {{normally}} developed Assyrian brothers with isolated pancreatic co-lipase deficiency are described. They {{presented at the}} age of 5 - 6 years with loose stools. They had <b>steatorrhoea,</b> and analysis of exocrine pancreatic enzymes in the small intestine showed co-lipase deficiency, while amylase, chymotrypsin, trypsin and lipase were normal. Intraduodenal infusion of purified co-lipase improved fat digestion measured by the triolein breath test. Their <b>steatorrhoea</b> diminished on treatment with enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes...|$|E
40|$|Oral {{pancreatic}} enzyme supplements, including those protected from gastric acidity by enteric coating, often achieve only partial correction of pancreatic <b>steatorrhoea.</b> To characterise the mechanisms involved in vivo, eight patients with <b>steatorrhoea</b> due to advanced pancreatic insufficiency and nine healthy controls were studied. Two sets of studies (small bowel intubation and five day faecal fat quantification) were randomly performed while patients were either on enteric coated pancreatin or equivalent placebo. A 260 cm long multilumen tube {{was used for}} double marker perfusion of two 20 cm segments located in the duodenum and in the ileum respectively. Luminal pH, flow, and trypsin and lipase activity outputs were measured at each segment for four hours postcibally. Placebo treated patients with pancreatic <b>steatorrhoea</b> had low enzyme outputs in the duodenal test segment and even lower outputs in the ileal segment. Pancreatin treatment significantly decreased <b>steatorrhoea</b> (p < 0. 05) and increased luminal enzyme outputs (p < 0. 05). The increase was much greater in the ileal than in the duodenal segment. Thus enteric coated pancreatin treatment abolished the normal gradient between postcibal duodenal and ileal lipase output. The results suggest that enteric coated pancreatin nearly corrects severe pancreatic <b>steatorrhoea.</b> The ingested lipase was utilised inefficiently, however, as luminal enzyme activity in the ileum was enhanced {{to a greater extent}} than in the duodenum, and consequently the absorptive potential of the small bowel was only partially utilised...|$|E
40|$|Sixty-three unselected {{cases of}} giardiasis, with no {{evidence}} of other systemic disease, were screened for evidence of <b>steatorrhoea.</b> No patient had any evidence of protein-energy malnutrition. Seventeen (27 %) of the cases had steatorrhoea; three (17 - 8 %) of the 17 patients having <b>steatorrhoea</b> also had D-xylose malabsorption. Vitamin B 12 absorption was normal in all. Bacterial culture and qualitative analysis of bile salt in jejunal fluid {{was carried out in}} all the 17 cases having <b>steatorrhoea</b> as well as 13 cases with normal absorptive parameters (eight cases of irritable bowel syndrome and five cases of giardia infection) who served as controls. All the patients showing bacterial overgrowth had free bile acids in their duodenal aspirate. Free bile acids could also be detected in jejunal aspirates of five of the seven patients having no bacterial overgrowth. Two control cases of giardia infection with normal small bowel function and sterile duodenal aspirate showed evidence of bile salt deconjugation. The significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of <b>steatorrhoea</b> in patients with giardiasis. The possible role of giardia in bile salt deconjugation is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Digestive enzymatic {{activities}} (disaccharidases, alkaline phosphatase, peptide hydrolases) have been determined in the mucosa of 14 {{patients with chronic}} pancreatitis. All had an abnormal secretin-pancreozymin test. Four patients had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, four a pathological glucose tolerance test. Nine patients had <b>steatorrhoea.</b> Maltase, sucrase, and alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly elevated in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, whereas those of lactase, trehalase, and peptide hydrolase were normal. Patients with <b>steatorrhoea</b> had higher maltase and sucrase activity than those without <b>steatorrhoea,</b> whereas decreased glucose tolerance {{had no effect on}} brush border enzymatic activity. It is suggested thatdecreased exocrine rather than decreased endocrine pancreatic function is responsible for the increase in intestinal disaccharidase and alkaline phosphatase activity, possible by the influence of pacreatic enzymes on the turnover of brush border enzymes from the luminal side of the mucosal membranes or by direct hormonal stimulation though cholecystokinin...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} measuring urinary oxalate output instead of faecal fat excretion as an outpatient screening test for <b>steatorrhoea,</b> we determined 24 hour urinary oxalate and five day faecal fat excretion before and during an oral load of sodium oxalate 600 mg daily (oxalate 4. 44 mmol), in 32 patients with suspected malabsorption on a diet containing oxalate 30 mg (0. 33 mmol), fat 50 g (180 mmol), and calcium 1 g (25 mmol). Nineteen patients proved to have <b>steatorrhoea</b> (mean faecal fat 62 mmol/ 24 h, range 19 [...] 186 mmol) of varying aetiologies. On the diet alone, urinary oxalate was raised in only nine of these patients (mean 0. 25 mmol/ 24 h, range 0. 08 [...] 0. 59 mmol) (normal less than 0. 20). By contrast, when the diet was supplemented with oral sodium oxalate, all 19 patients with <b>steatorrhoea</b> had hyperoxaluria (mean 0. 91 mmol/ 24 h, range 0. 46 [...] 1. 44 mmol) (normal less than 0. 44). There was a significant positive linear relationship between urinary oxalate and faecal fat when the 32 patients were on the high oxalate intake (r = 0. 73, P less than 0. 001), but not when {{they were on the}} low oxalate intake. Mean percentage absorption of orally administered oxalate was 5. 8 +/- 0. 99 % (+/- 1 SD) in normal subjects and 14. 7 +/- 6. 0 % (P less than 0. 002) in patients with <b>steatorrhoea.</b> Measurement of urinary oxalate output during oral sodium oxalate loading appears to be a reliable and convenient screening test for <b>steatorrhoea...</b>|$|E
40|$|A 60 {{year old}} man {{developed}} <b>steatorrhoea,</b> weight loss, mild diabetes mellitus, labile hypertension and limb cramps. Raised plasma concentrations of catecholamines, particularly noradrenaline and a computed tomography-scan showing an adrenal tumour strongly suggested a pheochromocytoma. Adrenoreceptor blockade reversed the symptoms, decreased faecal fat, and increased duodenal trypsin to normal concentrations. After adrenalectomy {{the patient was}} asymptomatic {{and there was no}} <b>steatorrhoea.</b> The blood glucose concentrations became normal.

40|$|Of eight {{patients}} with Paget's disease one had diarrhoea, <b>steatorrhoea,</b> impaired xylose absorption, and macrocytic anaemia due to folic acid deficiency, while another had diarrhoea and very low xylose absorption. In both patients jejunal biopsy was normal, and they responded to folic acid therapy with considerable increase in xylose absorption. Low xylose excretion {{was seen in}} three more patients, one of whom also had <b>steatorrhoea.</b> Thus malabsorption may be a systemic complication of Paget's disease of bone, possibly due either to secondary folate deficiency or to relative ischaemia of the bowel...|$|E
40|$|Chamberlain's, McGregor's and Bull's angle {{measurements}} for basilar {{impression of the}} skull were made on 22 adult patients with idiopathic <b>steatorrhoea</b> (probable gluten enteropathy), 24 patients who had had previous gastric surgery, and 48 control subjects. For {{each of the three}} measurements a value greater than the mean plus two standard deviations was taken as the upper limit of normal. In seven patients with adult <b>steatorrhoea</b> all three measurements were abnormal suggesting basilar impression, while basilar impression was probable in only one patient who had gastric surgery. The trend towards abnormal measurements was significant in the <b>steatorrhoea</b> patients but not in those who had gastric surgery. Basilar impression also was present in patients who did not have rickets or present evidence of osteomalacia. It was argued that this study could support a hypothesis that some cases of primary basilar impression of the skull are secondary to bone softening associated with malabsorption in early life, the evidence of which may have disappeared in adult life...|$|E
40|$|EDITORIAL SYNOPSIS The test {{described}} {{appears to}} be the most sensitive available assessment of jejunal function. It seems likely that the impairment of absorption in idiopathic <b>steatorrhoea</b> is largely due to diminished mucosal surface area. Although a flat glucose tolerance test has long been {{regarded as one of the}} hallmarks of idiopathic <b>steatorrhoea</b> (Thaysen, 1926), there have been only a few attempts to measure glucose absorption more directly in this condition. On the few occasions on which this has been done, by using intestinal intubation, glucose absorption has been found to be only a fraction of that in normal persons (Groen...|$|E
40|$|Pre- and {{post-prandial}} serum conjugates of {{cholic acid}} (SCCA) were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in 83 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), 14 of whom {{did not have}} <b>steatorrhoea,</b> and in 25 controls. Of the CF patients with <b>steatorrhoea,</b> 38 % had fasting SCCA levels greater than 3 standard deviations above mean fasting control values, whereas no CF patient without <b>steatorrhoea</b> had elevated fasting SCCA levels. Steatorrhoeic patients with palpable livers had higher pre- and post-prandial SCCA levels. Post-prandial SCCA levels failed to discriminate between control and CF groups however. Other serum tests of liver function, including the aspartate amino transferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, gamma globulin, and albumin : globulin ratio, failed to correlate with the SCCA. Changes in serum protein constituents correlated strongly with pulmonary dysfunction. The results suggest that elevation of fasting SCCA levels in CF patients is a more sensitive indicator of liver dysfunction than other tests and is a better discriminator than post-prandial SCCA levels between normal and abnormal liver function. The test is recommended for early detection of liver dysfunction in CF patients...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{treatment}} of pancreatic <b>steatorrhoea</b> in {{man has been}} unsatisfactory because 90 % of the lipase content of therapy is inactivated by acid in the stomach and large doses of replacement treatment are needed to provide adequate supplementation. An acid stable agent (fungal lipase) was investigated in the {{treatment of}} pancreatic deficiency <b>steatorrhoea</b> in 11 pancreatectomised dogs maintained on a fixed dietary intake of fat and treated with pancreatin or fungal lipase. Ten grams (60, 000 U lipase) of pancreatin was compared with 400 mg (4800 U lipase) of fungal lipase administered with each meal against a no treatment group. There {{was no significant difference in}} stool bulk and faecal fat excretion between pancreatin and lipase treated animals. Both groups showed a significant reduction in stool bulk and fat excretion when compared with the no treatment group (p less than 0. 01). A markedly diminished treatment volume, in the form of fungal lipase, is as effective in controlling <b>steatorrhoea</b> as pancreatin and may prove to be a potentially valuable therapy for patients with pancreatic insufficiency...|$|E
