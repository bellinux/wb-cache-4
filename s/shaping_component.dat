We obtained this amplifier by using specific intracavity components such as a phase mirror and a birefringent filter to generate a large spatial mode and a large spectral width. © 2003 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 140. 3530, 140. 0140, 140. 3480.

40|$|Constraint {{treatments}} for motor deficits after stroke involve immobilizing the unaffected arm and providing extensive {{practice with the}} affected arm to improve movement (e. g., Wolf et al., 1989; 2006). Similarly, constraint {{treatments for}} aphasia, or Constraint-Induced Language Therapy (CILT), require particular types of verbal output (the constraint) and extensive practice making verbal responses to improve speaking (Maher et al., 2006; Pulvermüller et al., 2001). In both the motor and language realms, performance benchmarks must be attained before a patient is able {{to move to the}} next level of training (the <b>shaping</b> <b>component</b> of the constraint treatment approach). A vital ingredient in the constraint treatment approach is massed practice. In a recent review of aphasia rehabilitation studies, Cherney et al., (2008), found that intensity of treatment was the most important variable in improved language. Likewise, intensity of treatment {{has been shown to be}} a critical factor for motor recovery (Wolf et al., 2007), as well as language therapies (Bhogal, Teasell, & Speechley, 2003).

40|$|The {{magnetic}} field that supports tokamak and stellarator plasmas must {{be produced by}} coils well separated from the plasma. However the larger the separation, {{the more difficult it}} is to produce a given {{magnetic field}} in the plasma region, so plasma configurations should be chosen that can be supported as efficiently as possible by distant coils. The efficiency of an externally-generated magnetic field {{is a measure of the}} field's <b>shaping</b> <b>component</b> magnitude at the plasma compared to the magnitude near the coils; the efficiency of a plasma equilibrium can be measured using the efficiency of the required external shaping field. Counterintuitively, plasma shapes with low curvature and spectral width may have low efficiency, whereas plasma shapes with sharp edges may have high efficiency. Two precise measures of magnetic field efficiency, which correctly identify such differences in difficulty, will be examined. These measures, which can be expressed as matrices, relate the externally-produced normal magnetic field on the plasma surface to the either the normal field or current on a distant control surface. A singular value decomposition (SVD) of either matrix yields an efficiency ordered basis for the magnetic field distributions. Calculations are carried out for both tokamak and stellarator cases. For axisymmetric surfaces with circular cross-section, the SVD is calculated analytically, and the range of poloidal and toroidal mode numbers that can be controlled to a given desired level is determined. If formulated properly, these efficiency measures are independent of the coordinates used to parameterize the surfaces. Comment: To appear in Physics of Plasma...|$|E

In order to provide more freedom for controlling the local geometric features of the reconstructed free-form shapes (e.g., non-circular cross-sections), our modeling system creates each <b>shape</b> <b>component</b> from four construction curves. Using one pair of symmetric curves and one pair of general curves, an improved cross-sectional surface blending scheme is applied to generate a parametric surface for each component. The final symmetric free-form shape is progressively created, and is represented by 3 D triangular mesh.

This radial propagation is equivalent to a vectorial convolution with sector elements. The propagated gradient eld collides at centers of convex/concave <b>shape</b> <b>components,</b> which can be detected as points of high directional disparity. Anovel vectorial disparity measure called Cancellation Energy is used to measure this collision of the gradient field, and local maxima of this measure yield feature tokens.

In addition, a Gradient Signature is formed by the gradient field that collides at each center, which is itself a robust and size-independent description of the corresponding <b>shape</b> <b>component.</b> Experimental results demonstrate that the shape description is robust to distortion, noise and clutter. An important advantage of this scheme is that the feature tokens are obtained pre-attentively, without prior understanding of the image.

Mathematical morphology has emerged as a standard tool for detecting and isolating specific geometric structures in image data. Morphological shape decomposition techniques extract the structural <b>components</b> from the <b>shape.</b> The representation efficiency of the existing morphological shape decomposition algorithms is affected by two major factors such as the hard decision in decomposing the given shape in to simpler <b>shape</b> <b>components</b> and the effect of noise present in images. Fuzzy mathematical morphology overcomes these two problems by replacing the Boolean constructs in the morphological operations by corresponding generalizations from fuzzy logic. By app lying the powerful and flexible fuzzy concept for shape decomposition, the efficiency of morphological shape representation algorithms can be improved. We propose a new fuzzy based efficient morphological shape decomposition scheme (FMSD) which represents the object shape by a minimal set of <b>shape</b> <b>components</b> even with the presence of noise. 1.
