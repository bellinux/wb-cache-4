Stuart Price, {{the executive producer of}} Aphrodite, was responsible for additional production and mixing of the song. Minogue felt [...] "All the Lovers" [...] summarised the [...] "euphoria" [...] of the album perfectly and chose it to be the lead single from Aphrodite. It was then globally released by Parlophone as a CD single and digital download on 11 June 2010. [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is a midtempo disco song with influences of electropop music.
