50|$|Karna was a {{contemporary}} of his Kalachuri namesake Karna (also known as Lakshmi-Karna). Karna's father Bhima I had formed {{an alliance with}} the Lakshmi-Karna to defeat the Paramaras of Malwa. The Paramara king Bhoja died as the alliance attacked Malwa, and a war of succession broke out between the Paramara relatives Jayasimha I and Udayaditya. Lakshmi-Karna seems to have occupied Malwa for <b>sometime,</b> but he <b>soon</b> suffered a series defeats against other neighbouring kings, and Bhima broke away from him.|$|R

2500|$|In the 1940s, Parks and {{her husband}} were members of the Voters' League. <b>Sometime</b> <b>soon</b> after 1944, she held a brief job at Maxwell Air Force Base, which, despite its {{location}} in Montgomery, Alabama, did not permit racial segregation because it was federal property. She rode on its integrated trolley. Speaking to her biographer, Parks noted, [...] "You might just say Maxwell opened my eyes up." [...] Parks worked as a housekeeper and seamstress for Clifford and Virginia Durr, a white couple. Politically liberal, the Durrs became her friends. They encouraged—and eventually helped sponsor—Parks in the summer of 1955 to attend the Highlander Folk School, an education center for activism in workers' rights and racial equality in Monteagle, Tennessee. There Parks was mentored by the veteran organizer Septima Clark. In 1945, despite the Jim Crow laws and discrimination by registrars, she succeeded in registering to vote on her third try.|$|E
50|$|The past of {{the temple}} is still obscure except for some myths. It was at this place where Divakara Muni Vilwamangalam, the great Tulu Brahmin sage, did penance and {{performed}} poojas. Legend has it that one day Lord Narayana appeared before him as a child. The boy’s face was glowing with radiance and this overwhelmed the sage. He became anxious and asked who he was. The boy replied {{that he had no}} father no mother and none at home. Vilwamangalam felt pity for the boy and allowed him to stay there. The boy proposed a condition that whenever he feels humiliated he will leave the place at once. He served the sage for <b>sometime.</b> But <b>soon</b> his juvenile pranks became intolerable for the sage and he reacted violently.

25|$|The zygote remains {{inactive}} for <b>sometime</b> but it <b>soon</b> elongates, becomes vermiform (worm-like) and motile. It is {{now known}} as ookinete. The pointed ends of ookinete penetrate the stomach wall and come to lie below its outer epithelial layer. Here the zygote becomes spherical and develops a cyst wall around itself. The cyst wall is derived partly from the stomach tissues and partly produced by the zygote itself. At this stage, the zygote is known as an oocyst. The oocyst absorbs nourishment and grows in size. Oocysts protrude from the surface of stomach, giving it a blistered appearance. In a highly infected mosquito, as many as 1000 oocysts may be seen.|$|R

5|$|Before the {{expedition}} sailed from Constantinople, Solomon was named {{as one of}} the nine commanders of the foederati regiments. He is not mentioned in Procopius's narrative during the subsequent campaign, but he probably participated in the decisive Battle of Ad Decimum on 13 September 533, which opened the road for the Vandal capital of Carthage. Following the capture of Carthage, Belisarius sent Solomon back to Constantinople to inform Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) of the campaign's progress. Solomon remained in the capital until the spring of 534, when Justinian sent him back to Africa to recall Belisarius and replace him as military commander of the new praetorian prefecture of Africa (magister militum Africae). Belisarius's departure coincided with a general uprising of the Moorish tribes of the interior, before the Byzantines had time to strengthen their hold on the province. As a result, Belisarius left most of his privately raised bucellarii behind, and Emperor Justinian sent additional reinforcements. <b>Soon</b> (<b>sometime</b> in autumn of 534) Emperor Justinian also invested Solomon with the civil office of praetorian prefect as well, replacing the aged Archelaus.|$|R

Mary became furious at his forwardness and tasteless actions and refused to help.

40|$|Assisted {{reproductive}} technology (2 ̆ 2 ART 2 ̆ 2), including egg donation, {{is changing}} the topography of the American family. Heated debates and legislative battles over cloning and stem cell research reveal {{the complexity of the}} moral, scientific, and legal implications of emerging alternative reproductive methods. In fact, the field of reproductive medicine is the 2 ̆ 2 Wild West 2 ̆ 2 of the healthcare world where technological development is testing the boundaries of science and ethics. The legal and ethical issues intrinsic to the evolution of the egg donation industry are poised to become central topics of public debate as we, as a culture, reevaluate who and what constitutes a 2 ̆ 2 parent 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 child, 2 ̆ 2 whether a human egg is a commodity, and what privacy and medical confidentiality mean relative to the right to know one 2 ̆ 7 s genetic make-up. Largely unregulated and untested in court, egg donation spawns a multitude of unanswered legal questions that will inevitably begin to emerge <b>sometime</b> very <b>soon.</b> Litigation in this field is looming. For lack of precedent, conclusions are reached by comparison to the analogous legal issues surrounding adoption, surrogacy, sperm donation, and blood donation, as well as the social trends implied by tangential precedent. Section I reviews the very limited history of litigation in which egg donation was a factor, the comparably scarce state and federal regulation of egg donation, and the case and statutory law covering analogous legal topics. Part II. A explores whether liability could attach under a product liability theory while Part II. B examines an egg donor’s potential liability for latent genetic disease inherited by the egg donation child under a negligence theory. Part III offers recommendations for regulating egg donation in order to prevent suits similar to those described in the comment. The comment argues that the burden of care should rest on the fertility clinic doctors and the egg donation agencies to properly screen egg donors...|$|R
2500|$|In January 2007 Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz {{announced}} that the interview phase of the beatification process, in Italy and Poland, was nearing completion. In February 2007, second class relics of Pope John Paul II—pieces of white papal cassocks he used to wear—were freely distributed with prayer cards for the cause, a typical pious practice after a saintly Catholic's death. On 8 March 2007, the Vicariate of Rome {{announced that}} the diocesan phase of John Paul's cause for beatification was at an end. Following a ceremony on 2 April 2007—the second anniversary of the Pontiff's death—the cause proceeded to the scrutiny of the committee of lay, clerical, and episcopal members of the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, to conduct a separate investigation. On the fourth anniversary of Pope John Paul's death, 2 April 2009, Cardinal Dziwisz, told reporters of a presumed miracle that had recently occurred at the former pope's tomb in St. Peter's Basilica. A nine-year-old Polish boy from Gdańsk, who was suffering from kidney cancer and was completely unable to walk, had been visiting the tomb with his parents. On leaving St. Peter's Basilica, the boy told them, [...] "I want to walk," [...] and began walking normally. On 16 November 2009, a panel of reviewers at the Congregation for the Causes of Saints voted unanimously that Pope John PaulII had lived a life of heroic virtue. On 19 December 2009, Pope Benedict XVI signed {{the first of two}} decrees needed for beatification and proclaimed John Paul II [...] "Venerable", asserting that he had lived a heroic, virtuous life. The second vote and the second signed decree certifying the authenticity of the first miracle, the curing of Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, a French nun, from Parkinson's disease. Once the second decree is signed, the positio (the report on the cause, with documentation about his life and writings and with information on the cause) is complete. He can then be beatified. Some speculated that he would be beatified <b>sometime</b> during (or <b>soon</b> after) the month of the 32nd anniversary of his 1978 election, in October 2010. As Monsignor Oder noted, this course would have been possible if the second decree were signed in time by Benedict XVI, stating that a posthumous miracle directly attributable to his intercession had occurred, completing the positio.|$|R
