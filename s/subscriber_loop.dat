40|$|Abstract — It {{is known}} that radio {{frequency}} interference (RFI) degrades the performance of DMT systems for digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>loops.</b> The RFI signal, though narrowband in nature, may be spread to subchannels around the RFI frequencies due to the large sidelobes of the receiving rectangular window. In this paper, we propose a joint consideration of channel shortening and RFI suppression {{in the design of}} time domain equalizers (TEQ). We will design the TEQ by minimizing ISI, channel noise and RFI interference. Simulation results are given to show that the proposed method can considerably reduce interference around the RFI frequencies and increase the transmission rate.

However, in a practical situation, the model mismatch and other unknown interference may greatly degrade the accuracy of the result. The major contribution of the paper is to provide a robust solution for the crosstalk identification in the presence of radio frequency interference (RFI) and other unknown interference.

We describe an adaptive piecewise linear fit technique for closely approximating the channel response, using relatively few parameters. The approximation error and adaptation behaviour of this technique are shown for representative channel responses. The results indicate the viability of the technique for decision feedback equalizers used within or outside reduced state sequence estimators. 1...|$|R
50|$|Digital {{subscriber}} line (DSL; originally digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop)</b> is {{a family}} of technologies {{that are used to}} transmit digital data over telephone lines. In telecommunications marketing, the term DSL is widely understood to mean asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), the most commonly installed DSL technology, for Internet access. DSL service can be delivered simultaneously with wired telephone service on the same telephone line. This is possible because DSL uses higher frequency bands for data. On the customer premises, a DSL filter on each non-DSL outlet blocks any high-frequency interference to enable simultaneous use of the voice and DSL services.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{sophisticated}} electronics {{in the early part}} of the 1990s, telephone service providers developed methods to share a single copper line to transmit multiple telephone calls simultaneously. Various pair gain methods using time-division multiplexing and frequency-division multiplexing prevented interference between simultaneous calls. A distant suburb may have a <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop</b> carrier or digital loop carrier system in which a remote concentrator is located near the subscribers to connect multiple local subscriber loops to one common line to a central office exchange. A single optical fibre can also be shared between multiple subscribers in fibre to the cabinet systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—For the single-pair HDSL (HDSL 2), {{the concept}} of having {{different}} upstream and downstream power spectral densi-ties is highlighted. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the input of the central office HDSL terminal unit (HTU-C) can be enhanced by boosting the power output of the remote user HDSL terminal unit (HTU-R). Further improvement in performance {{can be achieved by}} reducing the HTU-C NEXT interference. Two techniques are proposed to reach this goal. The first approach is to reduce the HTU-C transmitter power in the downstream direction for shorter reach cables. The second approach is borrowed from the analog frequency-modulation preemphasis/deemphasis frequency tilting in the upstream direction. Combining the three techniques leads to at least 6 -dB SNR margin improvement for the full reach car-rier serving area <b>loops.</b> Index Terms—Digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>loops,</b> HDSL/HDSL 2, preem-phasis/deemphasis, spectrum modification.

50|$|In most areas, one carrier held a {{monopoly}} on local service. The landline telephone system was originally constructed in an era before transistorisation, remote concentrators or cabinetisation. Individual lines from subscribers ran not to a remote concentrator but directly to the nearest village community dial office, to be terminated at an automated mechanical switch or manual exchange. To keep <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop</b> wiring requirements manageable, local exchanges were built in each tiny hamlet. Rural subscribers often made do with party line service. Each village was a separate rate center for long-distance calls and each had its own block of ten thousand numbers (the largest that reasonably could fit on a small-town manual cord switchboard with a jack and indicator for each line). In most small villages, many of these numbers would remain unused. In large cities, multiple exchanges were created to cover individual districts or neighbourhoods; each had its own series of distinctive prefixes, and multiple blocks of ten thousand numbers each. The first few digits of a number uniquely identified a village, a town or a neighbourhood of a big city.|$|E
5000|$|The public {{switched}} telephone network, {{the network}} of switching centers, trunk lines, amplifiers and switches which transmits telephone calls from one phone to another, is designed to carry voice frequency signals, and is therefore limited to a bandwidth of 3.4 kHz. Before DSL, voice-band modems transmitted information through the telephone network with audio frequencies within that bandwidth, which limited them to a data rate of about 56 kbit/s. However, the copper wires that connect telephones with the local switching center (telephone exchange), called the <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop,</b> are actually able to carry a much wider band of frequencies, up to several megahertz. [...] This capacity is unused in normal phone service. DSL uses these higher frequencies to send digital data between the DSL modem and the local switching center, without interfering with normal telephone service. At the local switching center the data is transferred directly between the customer's phone line and internet lines, so DSL signals do not travel through the telephone network itself. It {{is not necessary to}} dial a telephone number to initiate a connection; the DSL connection is [...] "on" [...] whenever the modem is on.|$|E
40|$|The <b>{{subscriber}}</b> <b>loop</b> {{forms the}} final link between the. subscriber {{and the actual}} telephone network. The pair of twisted copper wires which form the loop must be well maintained to avoid poor quality service to subscriber or customer. By conducting periodic testing of the <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop,</b> the telephone company can ensure the high standards of service that they desire. The purpose of this research project is to design a new loop tester based on a digital signal processing (DSP) chip, replacing the old analog-based testers. The DSP chip uses an analog-digital converter (ADC) to take sample measurements of various signals on the <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop</b> and a digital-analog converter (DAC) to output control signals.

The algorithms are then tested versus known input values to qualify the testing procedure and analysis for use on an actual <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop.</b> Finally, the software is used to provide test results of various fault conditions on a pair of twisted copper wires. The results from these tests show that the DSP-based loop tester can measure varying line resistance and capacitance due to faults present on the <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop,</b> which can lead to accurate fault analysis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} suppressing radio {{frequency}} interference (RFI) in discrete multitone (DMT) based very high bit rate digital subscriber line (VDSL) systems. The method operates in the frequency domain of a DMT system. First, we derive a model of how an unknown narrow-band RF signal is mapped onto the DMT carriers. Then, by measuring the RFI on a few unused DMT carriers {{we are able to}} subtract RFI estimates from every modulated subcarrier. Simulation results show that this method, applied to an RFI signal with the same average power as the VDSL signal, suppresses the RFI with 40 – 50 dB, which reduces the average SNR loss from about 20 to less than 0. 3 dB.

Optimum pole-zero location, which is suited to line characteristics in a wide frequency band, is also discussed. In order to attain high accuracy capacitor ratios using a small unit capacitor, capacitor values are rounded off into equivalent integer values, and are discretely optimized using pole-zero deviation as an error criterion. The equalizer has {{a finite number of}} frequency responses which correspond to line lengths. Gain and delay time differences between the adjoining step responses are compressed. The switched capacitor line equalizer was fabricated using 3 - mu m CMOS technology. Measured data were very close to designed performances...|$|R
