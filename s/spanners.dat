5|$|A {{variant of}} the minimax path problem has also been {{considered}} for sets of points in the Euclidean plane. As in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax path problem can be solved efficiently by finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every path in the tree is a minimax path. However, the problem becomes more complicated when a path is desired that not only minimizes the hop length but also, among paths with the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length of the path. The solution can be approximated using geometric <b>spanners.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{next day}} the brigade crossed the bridge and at midday {{continued}} east towards Es Salt. By 17:00 the regiment was camped {{to the west of}} the town. They entered the unoccupied Es Salt on the following day, watered their horses, then continued east towards Amman as the vanguard. Passing abandoned wagons, dead men and animals, they had caught up with the Turkish rearguard by 12:00, but had to stop at the village of Suweileh to water their horses and wait for the rest of the brigade to catch up with them. That night a selected group of 100 men, commanded by Major John Herrold, were sent out [...] across country to damage the Hedjaz rail line south of Amman. Each of the three squadrons provided an officer and thirty-three men. Their only tools were two picks, two shovels, and four <b>spanners.</b> The force was divided into three: one to tackle the rails and the other two to provide protection. When they found the rail line, they followed it for about [...] Hearing sounds of digging, they dismounted, continuing on foot until they located a group of Turks digging trenches. Part of their objective was to remain undetected, so they withdrew, leaving the Turkish force alone. They eventually located the section of track they were looking for. However, the road alongside the tracks was full of Turkish traffic. Establishing a base [...] from the track, the rail group now crept forward to attack the tracks. Their work was first interrupted when an armoured train with trucks full of soldiers came along the rails. They were next disturbed by a mounted patrol, which passed by without observing them. They eventually removed two rails, making the tracks unusable. The group then returned to their horses and returned to the regiment at dawn. That day the value of their efforts was seen when a train was wrecked where they had broken the rails. For his command of the operation Herrold was invested as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The greedy <b>spanner</b> is a {{high-quality}} spanner: its total weight, edge count and maximal degree are asymptotically optimal and in prac-tice {{significantly better than}} for any other <b>spanner</b> with reasonable con-struction time. Unfortunately, all known algorithms that compute the greedy <b>spanner</b> of n points use Ω(n 2) space, which is impractical on large instances. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, the largest instance for which the greedy <b>spanner</b> was computed so far has about 13, 000 vertices. We present a O(n) -space algorithm that computes the same <b>spanner</b> for points in Rd running in O(n 2 log 2 n) time for any fixed stretch factor and dimension. We discuss and evaluate a number of optimizations to its running time, which allowed us to compute the greedy <b>spanner</b> on a graph with a million vertices. To our knowledge, this is also the first algorithm for the greedy <b>spanner</b> with a near-quadratic running time guarantee that has actually been implemented. ...|$|R
40|$|Tree <b>spanner</b> {{problems}} have important applications in network design, e. g. in the telecommunications industry. Mathematically, {{there have been}} considered {{quite a number of}} maxstretch tree <b>spanner</b> problems and of average stretch tree <b>spanner</b> problems. We propose a unified notation for 20 tree <b>spanner</b> problems, which we investigate for graphs with general positive weights, with metric weights, and with unit weights. This covers several prominent problems of combinatorial optimization. Having this notation at hand, we can clearly identify which problems coincide. In the case of unweighted graphs, the formally 20 problems collapse to only five different problems. Moreover, our systematic notation for tree <b>spanner</b> problems enables us to identify a tree <b>spanner</b> problem whose complexity status has not been solved so far. We are able to provide an NP-hardness proof. Furthermore, due to our new notation of tree <b>spanner</b> problems, we are able to detect that an inapproximability result that is due to Galbiati (2001, 2003) in fact applies to the classical max-stretch tree <b>spanner</b> problem. We conclude that the inapproximability factor for this problem thus is 2 − ε, instead of only 1 + √ 5 2 according to Peleg and Reshef (1999) ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Spanner</b> [1] is Google’s scalable, multi-version, globally-{{distributed}}, and synchronously-replicated database. In {{order to}} support distributed transactions at global scale, <b>Spanner</b> leverages on a novel TrueTime (TT) API that exposes clock uncertainty. In this paper, we discuss how <b>Spanner’s</b> TT-based approach relates to the concepts of causality and consistent cuts in the distributed systems literature. Then, armed with {{a better understanding of}} the tradeoffs made by the TT-based approach, we discuss how to eliminate its shortcomings. We consider two main issues with <b>Spanner’s</b> TT-based approach. First, it requires access to special hardware for maintaining tightly-synchronized clocks and minimizing uncertainty in TT. And second, transactions in <b>Spanner</b> are still delayed at commit time to compensate for the remaining TT uncertainty. To eliminate these shortcomings, we propose the use of AugmentedTime (AT), which combines the best of TT-based wallclock ordering with causality-based ordering in asynchronous distributed systems. We show that the size of AT can be kept small and AT can be added to <b>Spanner</b> in a backward-compatible fashion, and as such, AT can be used in lieu of (or in addition to) TT in <b>Spanner</b> for timestamping and querying data efficiently. 1 Brief review of <b>Spanner</b> and TrueTim...|$|R

It is an improvement over the well-known Yao graph and Θ-graph and their variants. We show how to construct such a <b>spanner</b> for a set of points in the plane in O(n log 10 n) expected time. We {{introduce a}} variant of the Stable Roommates <b>Spanner</b> called the Stable Roommates Θ-Spanner which we can generalize to higher dimensions and construct more efficiently in O(n logdn) time.

She over-ran the fruitless Downs, {{threaded}} every turn of the maze of lanes below the hills, drew through the high- walled woods, impenetrable in their full leaf, came out at the cross roads where the butler had left me, and a little further on developed an internal trouble which forced me to turn her in on a grass way-waste that cut into a summer-silent hazel wood. So far as I could make sure by the sun and a six-inch Ordnance map, this should be the road flank of that wood which I had first explored from the heights above.

I rang my bell in an alluring manner, but the feet fled, and I repented, for to a child a sudden noise is very real terror. I must have been at work half an hour when I heard in the wood the voice of the blind woman crying: [...] "Children, oh children, where are you?"
