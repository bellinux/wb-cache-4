40|$|In {{a series}} of {{experiments}} the peak current during <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> of a fast switching valve, which {{was found to be}} out of tolerances with respect to some armature dimensions, was varied to realize different <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> times. Despite the fact that the holding current was identical for all cases and the time between <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> and off was very long, the valve’s switch off time showed an unexpected dependency <b>on</b> the <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> peak current value. This paper presents an explanation of this phenomenon by coarse mathematical models, demonstrating that the manufacturing error in combination with friction, skewness, and fluid stiction are responsible for this behavior...|$|R
5|$|With the club's {{finances}} in {{a strong}} position, York purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075 in September 1948. Over the late 1940s and early 1950s, concreting was completed on the terracing in the Popular Stand and the Shipton Street End. The Main Stand was extended towards Shipton Street over the summer of 1955, {{and a year later}} a concrete wall was built at the Grosvenor Road End, as a safety precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing. The ground was fitted with floodlights in 1959, which were officially <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> for a friendly against Newcastle United. The floodlights were updated and improved in 1980, and were officially <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> for a friendly with Grimsby Town. A gymnasium was built at the Grosvenor Road End in 1981, and two years later new offices for the manager, secretary, matchday and lottery manager were built, along with a vice-presidents' lounge.|$|E
5|$|A 1999 DEIS only {{proposed}} new subway service from 63rd Street north up Second Avenue to 125th Street via the Broadway Line to Lower Manhattan, with local and express tracks being <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> the Broadway Line. Second Avenue express trains would run to Lower Manhattan via the Montague Street Tunnel and local trains would run via the Manhattan Bridge and skip Lower Manhattan. A spur to Grand Central Terminal was considered, but later dropped {{due to its}} infeasibility.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source. Studies have proposed {{that this might be}} an involuntary stimulus behaviour, as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a light source is <b>switched</b> <b>on.</b> The colour of the light does not matter, but {{it has been shown that}} they react more strongly to underwater lights between the intensities of 1.5 to 2.5lx, with peak ranges of 2.5 to 10.0lx.|$|E
50|$|Each {{year the}} opening {{night of the}} Illuminations, The Big <b>Switch</b> <b>On,</b> held in a {{specially}} erected arena with a celebrity pulling a <b>switch</b> to turn <b>on</b> the six miles of lights. The first <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> ceremony was held in 1934 when Lord Derby flicked the <b>switch</b> to turn <b>on</b> the Illuminations. In 1993 BBC Radio 1 first broadcast the <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> ceremony live when Status Quo were the guest celebrities, before in 1997 BBC Radio 2 started to cover it which continued until 2010, when GMG Radio, under its Real Radio and Smooth Radio brands took over the broadcasting of the <b>switch</b> <b>on.</b> Each year one main celebrity pulls the switch while there are performances in the Radio 2 arena with a pre-switch on concert featuring pop bands, singers and comedians.|$|R

5|$|By August 16, 2011, {{the plant}} had {{generated}} 500TWh of electricity. In July 2008 it generated 10.3TWh of electricity, its first month over 10TWh. On June 30, 2009, after the river flow rate increased to over 24,000m3, all 28 generators were <b>switched</b> <b>on,</b> producing only 16,100MW because the head available during flood season is insufficient. During an August 2009 flood, the plant first reached its maximum output {{for a short}} period.|$|E
5|$|Current {{practice}} {{involves a}} celebrity turning {{the lights on}} in mid- to late-November, and they remain lit until 6 January (Twelfth Night). The festivities were postponed in 1963 due to the assassination of John F. Kennedy and in 1989 to fit Kylie Minogue's touring commitments. In 2015, the lights were <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> earlier, on Sunday 1 November, resulting in an unusual closure of the street to all traffic.|$|E
5|$|The Christmas tree is {{decorated}} with lights that are <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> at a seasonal ceremony. It is usually held twelve days before Christmas Day. The festivity {{is open to the}} public and attracts a large number of people. The switch-on is usually followed by several nights of Christmas carol singing and other performances and events. On the twelfth night of Christmas, the tree is taken down for recycling. Westminster City Council threatened to abandon the event to save £5,000 in 1980 but the decision was reversed.|$|E
5000|$|ON/OFF Control: Typically {{used for}} heating loads or speed control of motors, this control method {{involves}} turning the <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> for n integral cycles and turning the switch off for m integral cycles. Because turning the <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> and off causes undesirable harmonics to be created, the <b>switches</b> are turned <b>on</b> and off during zero-voltage and zero-current conditions (zero-crossing), effectively reducing the distortion.|$|R

5|$|The Leaf's {{electric}} warning sound had to {{be removed}} for cars delivered in the U.K., as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am, and the Leaf's audible warning system does not allow for such temporary deactivation. For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system is enabled by default, though a button on the dash permits drivers to disable the system until the next time the car is <b>switched</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} Main Stand used a propped {{cantilever roof}} design, which meant fewer pillars to block spectators' {{view of the}} pitch. Floodlights were installed in 1956, and officially <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> for a friendly match against Borussia Dortmund in 1957. By the early 1960s a stand had been built at the Railway End to the same design as the Main Stand, roofs had {{been put on the}} Kop and Tilton Road End, and the ground capacity was down to about 55,000.|$|E
5|$|A {{concrete}} wall was {{built at the}} Grosvenor Road End for over £3,000 in 1956, as a safety precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing. These improvements saw capacity extended to 23,600. Two FA Cup ties against First Division opposition were held at the ground in 1957–58: Birmingham City were beaten 3–0, followed by a 0–0 draw with Bolton Wanderers, which drew a capacity crowd of 23,600. Floodlights were installed at {{the ground in the}} summer of 1959, costing £14,500, a substantial part of which was raised by a supporters' club. They were officially <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> for a friendly against Newcastle United on 28 October 1959, which Newcastle won 8–2 before a crowd of 9,414.|$|E

5|$|From 2010, Smooth and Real Radio {{were the}} {{official}} broadcaster of the switch-on ceremony for the Blackpool Illuminations, the broadcast rights {{to which it}} won from BBC Radio 2, which had aired it since 1997. 2010 {{was the first time}} the event was broadcast on commercial radio. The annual event was compered by presenters from the two stations at a purposely-built arena, and featured a music concert by popular artists. Performers in 2010 included Alesha Dixon, Gabriella Cilmi, The Wanted, Olly Murs, and Robbie Williams, who <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> the lights that year. The 2012 switch-on was performed by Greg Rutherford, Luke Campbell and Beth TweddleBritish Olympians who won gold medals at the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of George's life, two {{calendars}} were used: the Old Style Julian calendar and the New Style Gregorian calendar. Before 1700, the two calendars were 10 days apart. Hanover switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar on 19 February (O.S.) / 1 March (N.S.) 1700. Great Britain <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> 3/14 September 1752. George was born on 30 October Old Style, which was 9 November New Style, but because the calendar shifted forward a further day in 1700, the date is occasionally miscalculated as 10 November. In this article, individual dates before September 1752 are indicated as either O.S. or N.S. or both. All dates after September 1752 are N.S. only. All years are assumed to start from 1 January and not 25 March, which was the English New Year.|$|E

This was followed first by a partially unreadable conversation between the captain and the first officers, which included if they were to fill fuel, and then an unreadable conversation between the captain and the jump seat passenger. The direction of the VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR) and distance measuring equipment (DME) at Brønnøysund was checked at 20:26:37.|$|E
5|$|The first {{community}} hall at Meander {{was built}} in 1914. It was built by local resident Fred Bowman, who maintained it until 1945 when responsibility {{was taken over by}} a local committee. Locals decided, in 1952, to build a new hall. Funding from the hall came from, competitions, dances and the growing of peas for sale. The hall opened 3 December 1954 and was physically joined to the original c.1957. The Road from Deloraine to Meander was sealed in 1964, an event of some note that was celebrated with a gymkhana and fair. Mains electricity reached Meander in 1952 when power, supplied by the Hydro-Electric Commission, was <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> in Meander's township area December 1952. Meander's street lights were first turned on 12 November 1971.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{part of the}} operation was over by 02:15. The intruders had spent over an hour in British airspace. Now the journey back over the sea to Germany and the Netherlands was undertaken. The British had jammed German radio beacons and <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> others with the same frequency. It was hoped the move would fool German pilots into landing in Britain in error. Experienced pilots did not fall for the ruse. Still, they had to fly over the sea by dead reckoning. A consequence of this showed that while around only five Ju 88s were lost in combat over England, eight crews were missing, three were killed in crash-landings and had died from their injuries, six crews had baled out 11 aircraft crashed or were damaged on landing.|$|E
