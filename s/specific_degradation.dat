50|$|Degradation {{involves}} both biotic and {{abiotic transformation}} processes. Biotic transformation is mediated by microorganisms, while abiotic transformation involves {{processes such as}} chemical and photochemical reactions. The <b>specific</b> <b>degradation</b> processes for a given pesticide are determined by its structure and by the environmental conditions it experiences. Redox gradients in soils, sediments or aquifers often determine which transformations can occur. Similarly, photochemical transformations require sunlight, available only in the topmost meter(s) of lakes or rivers, plant surfaces or submillimeter soil layers. Atmospheric phototransformation is another potential remediating influence.|$|E
30|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the ViSQOL model is demonstrated with performance evaluation with five experiments covering both VoIP <b>specific</b> <b>degradations</b> and general quality issues. Experiment 1 expands on the results on clock drift and warp detection presented in [5] and includes a comparison with subjective listener data. Experiment 2 evaluates the impact of small playout adjustments due to jitter buffers on objective quality assessment. Experiment 3 builds upon this to further analyze an open question from [28, 42], where POLQA and ViSQOL show inconsistent quality estimations for some combinations of speaker and playout adjustments. Experiment 4 uses a subjectively labeled database of VoIP degradations to benchmark model performance for clock drift, packet loss, and jitter. Finally, Experiment 5 presents benchmark tests with other publicly available speech quality databases to evaluate the {{effectiveness of}} the model to a wider range of speech quality issues.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} the Audio Degradation Toolbox (ADT) for the controlled degradation of audio signals, and propose its usage {{as a means}} of evaluating and comparing the robustness of audio processing algorithms. Music recordings encountered in practical applications are subject to varied, sometimes unpredictable degradation. For example, audio is degraded by low-quality microphones, noisy recording environments, MP 3 compression, dynamic compression in broadcasting or vinyl decay. In spite of this, no standard software for the degradation of audio exists, and music processing methods are usually evaluated against clean data. The ADT fills this gap by providing Matlab scripts that emulate a wide range of degradation types. We describe 14 degradation units, and how they can be chained to create more complex, `real-world' degradations. The ADT also provides functionality to adjust existing ground-truth, correcting for temporal distortions introduced by degradation. Using four different music informatics tasks, we show that performance strongly depends on the combination of method and degradation applied. We demonstrate that <b>specific</b> <b>degradations</b> can reduce or even reverse the performance difference between two competing methods.

50|$|Hops {{are also}} used in herbal {{medicine}} in a way similar to valerian, {{as a treatment for}} anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia. A pillow filled with hops is a popular folk remedy for sleeplessness, and animal research has shown a sedative effect. The relaxing effect of hops may be due, in part, to the <b>specific</b> <b>degradation</b> product from alpha acids, 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, as demonstrated from nighttime consumption of non-alcoholic beer. 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol is structurally similar to tert-amyl alcohol which was historically used as an anesthetic.

5000|$|One very {{promising}} therapeutic agent for myelogenous leukemia and potentially {{other forms of}} cancer is arsenic trioxide (ATO). One study has been done showing that ATO treatment leads to <b>specific</b> <b>degradation</b> of the AML1/MDS1/EVI1 oncoprotein and induces both apoptosis and differentiation. As an atypical use of traditional pharmacogenomics, this knowledge may lead to an increased ability to treat EVI1 positive leukemias that would normally have poor prognoses. If it is established that a clinical cancer case is EVI1 positive, altering the chemotherapeutic cocktail to include a specific EVI1 antagonist may aid to increase lifespan and prevent potential relapse. Arsenic is a fairly ancient human therapeutic agent, however it has only recently returned {{to the forefront of}} cancer treatment. It has been observed that it not only induces apoptosis but can also inhibit the cell cycle, and has marked anti-angiogenesis effects. As of 2006, Phase I and II clinical trials were being conducted to test this compound {{on a wide variety of}} cancer types, and currently (2008) a number of publications are showing positive outcomes in individual case studies, both pediatric and adult.|$|E

40|$|In budding yeast, ubiquitination of the {{cyclin-dependent kinase}} (Cdk) {{inhibitor}} Sic 1 is catalyzed by the E 2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Cdc 34 {{in conjunction with}} an E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex composed of Skp 1, Cdc 53 and the F-box protein, Cdc 4 (the SCFCdc 4 complex). Skp 1 binds a motif called the F-box and in turn F-box proteins appear to recruit specific substrates for ubiquitination. We find that Skp 1 interacts with Cdc 53 in vivo, and that Skp 1 bridges Cdc 53 to three different F-box proteins, Cdc 4, Met 30, and Grr 1. Cdc 53 contains independent binding sites for Cdc 34 and Skp 1 suggesting it functions as a scaffold protein within an E 2 /E 3 core complex. F-box proteins show remarkable functional specificity in vivo: Cdc 4 is <b>specific</b> for <b>degradation</b> of Sic 1, Grr 1 is <b>specific</b> for <b>degradation</b> of the G 1 cyclin Cln 2, and Met 30 is specific for repression of methionine biosynthesis genes.

40|$|The domain {{structure}} of heparan sulphate chains from an endothelial low-density proteoglycan was examined using <b>specific</b> <b>degradations</b> of the chains while {{attached to the}} intact proteoglycan. 'Inner' chain fragments, remaining on the protein core, were separated from 'outer' fragments by gel chromatography, and were subsequently released from the protein core by alkaline cleavage.

Using deaminative cleavage we obtained evidence that the first N-sulphated glucosamine residue is variably positioned some 10 - 17 disaccharides from the xylose-serine linkage of the proteoglycan. Digestion with heparinase yielded 'inner' and 'outer' fragments covering {{a broad range of}} different sizes, indicating a scarce and variable distribution of sulphated iduronic acid in the native chains. N-sulphated glucosamine occurred more frequently in the 'outer' fragments. We also studied the affinity of the endothelial heparan sulphate chains towards two presumptive biological ligands, namely antithrombin III and lipoprotein lipase. A major part of the endothelial heparan sulphate chains showed a weak affinity for antithrombin III and the affinity was essentially lost on heparinase digestion. On lipoprotein lipase-agarose the endothelial heparan sulphate chains were eluted at the same salt concentration as heparin, and the binding persisted, although with decreased strength, after digestion with heparinase...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{extensive}} database or reservoir sedimentation surveys throughout continental United States is compiled {{and analyzed}} to derive <b>specific</b> <b>degradation</b> (SD) relationships as function of mean annual rainfall (R), drainage area (A), land cover (or vegetation) factor (V), and watershed slope (S).
