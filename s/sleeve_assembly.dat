50|$|The cocking piece {{doubles as}} a safety and is {{attached}} {{at the rear of}} the bolt <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly</b> and secures the firing pin. When the cocking piece ending in a cocking ring is pulled rearward and turned horizontal, the cocking piece sear can be placed in a recessed safety slot in the bolt plug. This slot is shorter than the firing slot so the firing pin cannot protrude past the face of the bolt cylinder. Any contact with the cartridge primer is thus prevented. The safe mode also prevents the action from being cycled hence preventing the bolt from accidental opening. The operating ring is quite large, making it easy to operate with gloves. When the operating ring is in the vertical position and pulled back by cycling the action or cocking it by hand the action is ready to fire.|$|E
5000|$|The Mle 1915 Chauchat's {{performance}} on the battlefield drew decidedly mixed reviews from the users when the war was stagnating in the mud of the trenches in 1916. This brought about a survey, regiment by regiment, requested by General PÃ©tain in late 1916; the survey's essential conclusion was that the open-sided half-moon magazines were defective and caused about two thirds of all stoppages. For instance, it was a common practice for the gunners to oil up {{the inside of the}} magazines to facilitate movement of the 8mm Lebel rounds. Also, loose earth, grit, and other particles easily entered the gun through these open-sided magazines, an ever-present risk in the muddy environment of the trenches. An insistence on using only good, undeformed magazines with strong springs was the most practical solution to this problem. Chauchat gunners were also known to load their magazines with 18 or 19 rounds, instead of the maximum 20, {{in order to avoid the}} dreaded first-round failure to feed. The Chauchat's long recoil system is often cited as a source of excessive stress on the gunner when he fired this weapon. However, recent and extensive firing tests have demonstrated that it is the Chauchat's ergonomics and its loose bipod, rather than its recoil, that makes it a difficult gun to keep on target beyond very short bursts. On most of the Gladiator-made guns, the sights also made the Chauchat shoot systematically too low and to the right, a failing which was soon recognized, but never corrected. Overheating during uninterrupted periods of full automatic fire (about 120 rounds with the 8mm Lebel version) often resulted in the barrel <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly</b> locking in the rear position due to thermal expansion, causing stoppage of fire until the gun had cooled off. Hence, French and US Army manuals recommended firing in short bursts or semi-auto only. In essence, the Chauchat was a rather heavy ( [...] 20lbs [...] ) but portable assault rifle with limited full auto capability, rather than a true [...] "light machine gun". So, in 1918, the A.E.F. did not miss that point by officially labeling the Chauchat in its user manuals as an [...] "Automatic Rifle".|$|E

We report here on the results obtained. 1 Introduction The equipment of Module 0 with {{a new set of}} tiles has been completed recently. These new tiles were done by IHEP, Protvino. Once at CERN the tiles were wrapped with Tyvek and, on the two lateral sides where the fibers have to be connected, a small piece of aluminized Mylar was put (glued on one side and fixed with scotch tape in the other one) to keep the fibers in. The Tyvek sleeves were produce by the Irrigro Company, in Ontario. Approximately 160 tiles of each of the 11 sizes (see table 1), were assembled with <b>sleeves.</b> <b>Assembly</b> refers to unpacking tiles, inserting them into Tyvek sleeves and then installing Mylar strips over both ends to couple the tile to the WLS fibers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of cimetidine and ranitidine on human lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) and plasma levels of gastrin in all phases of the interdigestive motor complex and after a test meal. In a random, double-blind manner, placebo, cimetidine (1. 0 mg/kg X h), and ranitidine (0. 16 mg/kg X h) were administered by intravenous infusion to nine healthy volunteers. By using a <b>sleeve</b> catheter <b>assembly,</b> LESP was constantly monitored, as were esophageal, fundic, antral, and duodenal pressures. Considerable minute-to-minute and interdigestive motor phase-related LESP variations were observed. Cimetidine and ranitidine decreased the interdigestive LESP, but did not abolish the gradual increase in LESP from phase I to phase III. During the first 2 h after the meal, cimetidine and ranitidine had no significant effect on LESP. Plasma gastrin levels were increased by cimetidine and ranitidine, both in the interdigestive and in the postprandial state. The results indicate that the effect of H 2 -blockers on LESP is not gastrin-mediated. The results further indicate that, in studies on the effects of drugs on LESP, prolonged recording of LESP in all motor states is a prerequisit...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this pilot}} study is to {{demonstrate}} the technical and clinical feasibility of videomanometry to assess swallowing in infants and young children presenting with dysphagia. METHODS: We performed videomanometry using a combined solid state catheter and a perfused manometric <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly</b> in eight patients (2 - 28 months) presenting at a tertiary care institution with symptoms of dysphagia. Solid state sensors were positioned at the inferior margin of the valleculae and the laryngeal entrance and the upper esophageal sphincter <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly</b> was positioned across the upper esophageal sphincter. Manometric and radiological data were digitally recorded simultaneously using a manofluoromixer. Liquid bolus swallows were recorded in each patient and different geometric parameters of deglutition were measured. RESULTS: Placement and fixation of the catheter was well tolerated and no adverse effects occurred. The children easily swallowed test boluses as selected during clinical examination. Results indicate that pharyngeal contractility can be evaluated as well as relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter during swallowing of wet boluses.

40|$|In {{children}} technical {{limitations of}} upper oesophageal sphincter manometry have restricted investigation to the pull through technique under sedation. In {{this study we}} have used an adapted sleeve manometric technique for upper oesophageal sphincter monitoring in unsedated children and determined {{the influence of the}} state of arousal on upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. Twenty six children aged 3 to 42 months (median 17. 5 months), who were referred for evaluation of oesophageal motor function, were studied with dual <b>sleeve</b> manometric <b>assemblies</b> which monitored upper and lower oesophageal sphincter pressures simultaneously. Pharyngeal, oesophageal body, and gastric pressures were also monitored with seven perfused side holes. Recordings were made for four hours after a meal and were technically successful in 24 children. The child's state of arousal was scored every 12 th minute as follows: (A) resting, eyes closed, (B) resting, eyes open, (C) moving but comfortable, (D) restless and uncomfortable, (E) crying. In 67 % of the 12 minute samples the children showed good adaptation to the procedure (arousal states A to C). There was a highly significant difference in upper oesophageal sphincter pressure between each of the arousal states (p less than 0. 0001), being lowest in category A at (mean (SD) 18. 1 (10. 3) mmHg and highest in category D 55. 7 (13. 2) mm Hg. Abrupt changes in the state of arousal were associated with equally abrupt changes in upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. The state of arousal of unsedated children has an important influence on upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. It is essential that this factor is controlled for in any studies of upper oesophageal sphincter tone in children. The sleeve technique is capable of monitoring upper oesophageal sphincter motility for prolonged periods in unsedated children...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} testing {{explosive}} and pyrotechnic devices involves exploding the devices inside swell sleeves. Swell sleeves have been used previously for measuring forces. In the present method, {{they are used to}} obtain quantitative indications of the energy released in explosions of the devices under test. A swell sleeve is basically a thick-walled, hollow metal cylinder threaded at one end to accept a threaded surface on a device to be tested (see Figure 1). Once the device has been tightly threaded in place in the swell <b>sleeve,</b> the device-and-swell-sleeve <b>assembly</b> is placed in a test fixture, then the device is detonated. After the explosion, the assembly is removed from the test fixture and placed in a coordinate-measuring machine for measurement of the diameter of the swell sleeve as a function of axial position. For each axial position, the original diameter of the sleeve is subtracted from the diameter of the sleeve as swollen by the explosion to obtain the diametral swelling as a function of axial position (see Figure 2). The amount of swelling is taken as a measure of the energy released in the explosion. The amount of swelling can be compared to a standard amount of swelling to determine whether the pyrotechnic device functioned as specified...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Unavoidable {{catheter}} movement during sphincter of Oddi (SO) manometry {{can produce}} considerable {{variations in the}} basal pressure, due to movement of the recording sidehole. The sleeve sensor is a perfused channel which records the highest pressure point along its length. The aim {{of the study was}} to develop and evaluate a prototype sleeve sensor for SO manometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bench-testing was used to assess the dynamic performance of the <b>sleeve</b> and sidehole <b>assemblies.</b> Recordings were initially made with a standard triple-lumen catheter and then with a purpose-built manometric assembly which had a 15 mm long sleeve sensor. RESULTS: A perfusion rate of 0. 04 ml/min gave the best balance between baseline pressure offset and rise rate. Recordings were attempted in nine patients and successfully achieved in four. The sleeve and sidehole recordings of the maximal basal pressure did not differ significantly (mean +/- SEM, 86. 1 +/- 26. 5 mmHg vs. 90. 1 +/- 21. 0 mmHg, P = 0. 57, r = 0. 998). CONCLUSIONS: Unnecessarily high perfusion rates are being used for SO manometry. The sleeve sensor has the potential to monitor SO pressure more reliably than the currently used perfused sidehole method and should enhance the safety of prolonged SO manometry...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nitric oxide (NO) is well {{accepted}} as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the gastrointestinal tract; however, {{its role in}} the triggering of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) in humans remains to be determined. Therefore, the effect of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a specific NO synthase blocker, on gastric distention-induced TLESRs was investigated. METHODS: Esophageal manometry was performed using a perfused <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly.</b> The effect of L-NMMA was evaluated on water swallow-evoked primary peristalsis (n = 8; single-blind, placebo-controlled) and on the rate of TLESRs during gastric distention (n = 8; double-blind, placebo-controlled). RESULTS: L-NMMA increased the amplitude of peristaltic pressure waves in the distal esophagus and increased peristaltic velocity in the proximal esophagus. In contrast, L-NMMA had no effect on basal lower esophageal sphincter pressure, nadir pressure, duration, and area under the curve of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. L-NMMA significantly inhibited the increase in TLESRs during gastric distention. L-NMMA also increased the intraballoon pressure during distention. Conclusions: NO is one of the neurotransmitters involved in the reflex arc mediating the triggering of TLESRs. NO is involved in the timing of human esophageal peristalsis and may exert a tonic inhibition on the proximal stomac...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{were done}} to {{evaluate}} the lower oesophageal sphincter function of chronic smokers compared with non-smokers and to ascertain the acute effects of smoking on the sphincter and the occurrence of acid reflux. All subjects (non-smokers, asymptomatic cigarette smokers, and smokers with oesophagitis) were studied postprandially with a lower oesophageal sphincter <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly,</b> distal oesophageal pH electrode, and submental electromyographic electrodes. The two groups of cigarette smokers then smoked three cigarettes in succession before being recorded for an additional hour. As a group, the cigarette smokers had significantly lower lower oesophageal sphincter pressure compared with non-smokers but the sphincter was not further compromised by acutely smoking cigarettes. Cigarette smoking did, however, acutely increase {{the rate at which}} acid reflux events occurred. The mechanisms of acid reflux during cigarette smoking were mainly dependent upon the coexistence of diminished lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. Fewer than half of reflux events occurred by transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations. The majority of acid reflux occurred with coughing or deep inspiration during which abrupt increases in intra-abdominal pressure overpowered a feeble sphincter. We conclude that cigarette smoking probably exacerbates reflux disease by directly provoking acid reflux and perhaps by a long lasting reduction of lower oesophageal sphincter pressure...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{characterize}} esophageal {{body and}} lower esophageal sphincter (LES) motor function in very premature infants. STUDY DESIGN: Esophageal manometry {{was performed in}} 12 very premature infants of 26 to 33 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) (body weights of 610 - 1360 g). Esophageal motor patterns were recorded for 30 minutes with a perfused micromanometric <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly</b> (outer diameter, 2. 0 mm). RESULTS: Esophageal pressure waves triggered by dry swallows were predominantly (84 %) peristaltic in propagation sequence. All infants showed tonic LES contraction; the mean resting LES pressure (LESP) for individual infants ranged from 5. 0 +/- 4. 1 mm Hg to 20. 0 +/- 4. 8 mm Hg. In all infants the LES relaxed (duration, 5. 8 +/- 3. 0 seconds; nadir pressure, 1. 8 +/- 2. 6 mm Hg) in response to pharyngeal swallows. Transient LES relaxations (TLESRs) (duration, 21. 7 +/- 8. 7 seconds; nadir pressure, 0. 1 +/- 1. 8 mm Hg) occurred on average 2. 6 +/- 1. 6 times per study; 86 % of these relaxations triggered esophageal body common cavity events known {{to be associated with}} gastroesophageal reflux. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal motor function is well developed in very premature infants. Our data also suggest that TLESR is the predominant mechanism of reflux in these babies. Taher I. Omari, Marc A.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Transient lower esophageal {{sphincter}} relaxations (TLESRs) are {{the main}} mechanism underlying gastroesophageal reflux. In the present study we evaluated the effect of loxiglumide, a specific cholecystokininA (CCKA) -receptor antagonist, on the occurrence of TLESRs evoked by gastric distension. METHODS: Eight healthy subjects underwent esophageal manometry using a 10 -lumen <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly</b> during placebo or loxiglumide (10 mg/kg/h) in a randomized double-blind order. Gastric distension was induced by inflation of 400 ml of air. RESULTS: Basal lower esophageal pressure (LESP) and swallow-induced relaxation were not affected by loxiglumide. Loxiglumide significantly {{reduced the number of}} TLESRs, from 11. 5 (5. 8 - 18. 3) to 6. 0 (3. 3 - 14. 3) during the total recording period of 1 h, and from 5. 5 (4. 25 - 7. 5) to 2. 0 (0. 5 - 6. 8) during the first 15 min. The number of common cavities was significantly decreased by loxiglumide, from 8. 0 (4. 0 - 20. 0) to 5. 0 (2. 0 - 7. 8). TLESRs represented the main mechanism (60 % during placebo, 74 % during loxiglumide) underlying common cavities, followed by swallow-induced relaxation. CONCLUSIONS: Loxiglumide significantly reduces the number of TLESRs triggered by gastric distension without interfering with swallow-related relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, suggesting the involvement of CCKA receptors in the reflex pathway mediating TLESR...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{investigate}} {{the mechanisms of}} gastrointestinal side effects of tacrine, and find treatment methods with electroacupuncture (EA). Methods. Twenty-five healthy cats were randomly divided into 5 groups: gastric-distention group (model group), tacrine group (cholinesterase inhibitor), tacrine + sham acupoint group (control group), tacrine + PC 6 (neiguan) group, and tacrine + ST 36 (zusanli) group, with 5 cats in each group. Saline 2 [*]mL i. p. was given 30 [*]min before gastric distention in model group. Tacrine 5. 6 [*]mg/kg i. p. was given 30 minutes before gastric distention in the other groups. Tacrine + sham acupoint group (control group), tacrine + PC 6 group, and tacrine + ST 36 group received EA at corresponding acupoints during gastric distention. The frequency of TLESRs and LESP were recorded by using a perfused <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly.</b> Results. Compared with the model group, tacrine significantly increased the frequency of gastric distention-induced TLESR (P< 0. 05) but did not influence the rate of common cavity during TLESR. Tacrine significantly increased the LESP, which could not remain during gastric distention. EA at PC 6 could decrease the frequency of TLESR and maintain the increase of LESP, but EA at ST 36 did not have these effects. Conclusion. Tacrine can significantly increase the gastric distention-induced transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs). Electroacupuncture (EA) at PC 6 may reverse the above side effect...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundâCigarette {{smoking is}} known to affect {{adversely}} the defence mechanisms against gastro-oesophageal reflux. The effect of smoking on the supraoesophageal reflexes that prevent aspiration of gastric contents has not been previously studied. â¨AimsâTo elucidate the effect of cigarette smoking {{on two of the}} supraoesophageal reflexes: the pharyngo-upper oesophageal sphincter (UOS) contractile reflex; and the reflexive pharyngeal swallow. â¨MethodsâTen chronic smokers and 10 non-smokers were studied, before and 10 minutes after real or simulated smoking, respectively. UOS pressure and threshold volume for the reflexes were determined using a UOS <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly.</b> Two modes of fluid delivery into the pharynx were tested: rapid injection and slow injection. â¨ResultsâFor both rapid and slow injections, the threshold volume for triggering the pharyngo-UOS contractile reflex was significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers (rapid: smokers 0. 42 (SE 0. 07) ml, non-smokers 0. 16 (0. 04) ml; slow: smokers 0. 86 (0. 06) ml, non-smokers 0. 38 (0. 1) ml; p< 0. 05). During rapid injection, the threshold volume for reflexive pharyngeal swallow was higher in smokers (smokers 0. 94 (0. 09) ml, non-smokers 0. 46 (0. 05) ml; p< 0. 05). Acute smoking further increased the threshold volume for the pharyngo-UOS contractile reflex and reflexive pharyngeal swallow during rapid injection. â¨ConclusionsâSmoking adversely affects stimulation of the pharyngo-UOS contractile reflex and pharyngeal reflexive swallow. These findings may have implications in the development of reflux related respiratory complications among smokers. ...|$|E
40|$|Glutamate is an {{important}} excitatory amino acid and {{plays a major role}} in brain stem neurotransmission. Although the effect of glutamate on esophaoreal motility is well studied, its role in the triggering of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) remains to be determined. Esophageal manometry was performed in 10 healthy volunteers using a perfused <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly.</b> The effect of intragastric instillation of the nonspecific N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist dextromethorphan (30 mg) and the glutamate-release inhibitor riluzole (100 mg) was evaluated on esophageal motility and on the rate of TLESRs during isovolumetric gastric distension (500 ml). Dextromethorphan and riluzole had no effect on the amplitude or peristaltic velocity of esophageal pressure waves, basal LES pressure, or LES relaxation after water swallowing. Gastric distension increased the rate of TLESRs from 2. 0 (1. 0 - 3. 5) / 45 min to 5. 0 (4. 0 - 7. 0) / 45 min during, placebo (P < 0. 05). In contrast, the rate of TLESRs during gastric distension was significantly reduced with riluzole [4. 0 (2. 5 - 6. 0) / 45 min], but not with dextromethorphan. In conclusion, riluzole had no effect on swallow-induced LES relaxation, esophageal peristalsis, or gastric tone, but it reduced the number of TLESRs evoked by gastric distension. These findings suggest that glutamate may be involved in the neurocircuitry underlying TLESRs. However, as the effect was only marginal, additional studies are required to confirm our observation...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comBackground/Purpose Perfused multilumen sphincter of Oddi (SO) manometry is accepted as the gold standard for diagnosis of SO dysfunction. However, this technique is associated with a relatively high incidence of post-procedure acute pancreatitis. In addition, triple-lumen manometry recordings may be difficult to interpret, as movement may produce artifacts. We have refined the development of a sleeve sensor for human SO manometry. This assembly aims to overcome the above limitations. In this study the accuracy of sleeve SO manometry (SOM) has been evaluated and compared with standard triple-lumen perfused SOM. Methods Patients undergoing SO manometric studies consented to having both standard triple-lumen and sleeve SOM. A total of 32 paired studies were performed in 29 patients. Diagnosis was made only from standard triple-lumen SOM and the patient treated accordingly. For each study, SO basal pressure, contraction, amplitude, and frequency were recorded. Results There was no statistically significant difference in the recordings of SO basal pressure, contraction, amplitude, and frequency between the two techniques. A strong correlation was demonstrated between SO basal pressure determined with the two catheters. The accuracy of sleeve SOM is comparable to standard triple-lumen SOM, with less movement artifact. One patient developed mild post-manometric pancreatitis. Conclusions The sleeve catheter records SO pressures with comparable values to standard triple-lumen SOM. The <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly</b> potentially can replace the use of the perfused triple-lumen catheter for the objective diagnosis of SO dysfunction.

Present sleeve drafting methods represent unpredictable, single-style variations of past methods. They do not vary from the normal non-cohesive practises for any current inset sleeve styles. Current sleeve drafting methods contain only surface explanations for many of the features contained within the sleeve design. Drafting methods are restricted to surface, point-to-point drafting descriptive - they do not convey the actual detailed mechanisms required of the complete scye and <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly.</b> My perspective suggests that designing and pattern making has scarcely advanced {{since the beginning of the}} nineteenth century, or earlier. Therefore, the principal research question is: How might the role of the designer, the tasks of the pattern maker, the many in-set sleeve styles and related fabrics, be combined to create a unique inclusive in-set sleeve design system that is advantageous to the apparel industry? In order to create a unique in-set sleeve design system, this study incorporates a hybrid process derived from a number of design methods. Case studies of a number of sleeve styles and fabrics, representative of a major percentage of the sleeve design range, are developed to confirm the proposition that although each sleeve is a unique entity, they are, contradictory, all one and the same. This is because they are composed of the same limited number of parts and elements. The study details the parts and elements that compose the scye (armhole) and sleeves. These are united with a compilation of engineering drawing methods which are explained and analysed prior to incorporation with additional drawing interpretations. The adoption of engineering drawing methods as a base, with further adaptations, to create a new logical sleeve design system, is seen as a complete break from current trial and error practises to a predictable outcomes-focussed process...|$|E
40|$|Repeated {{oesophageal}} acidification is {{a definitive}} feature of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, {{which in turn}} is caused by relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS). This study in anaesthetised ferrets investigates the reflex pathways involved in effects of oesophageal acidification on motor function of the LOS, with particular focus on the role of tachykinins. LOS pressure was monitored with a perfused micromanometric <b>sleeve</b> <b>assembly.</b> Oesophageal acidification reduced LOS pressure by 48 +/- 5 % until washout with saline. This reduction became larger with repeated tests, and was unaffected in amplitude by acute bilateral vagotomy, although the response became slower in onset. Intra-oesophageal capsaicin (0. 5 % solution) caused a 68 +/- 17 % decrease in LOS pressure which remained unchanged with repeated tests. The NK- 1 receptor antagonist CP 96, 345 (1 - 5 mg/kg intravenous (i. v.) blocked the post-vagotomy LOS responses to both intra-luminal acid and capsaicin. Close intra-arterial (i. a.) injections of capsaicin (1 - 100 micrograms) gut induced LOS relaxation which was neither vagally nor NK- 1 receptor-mediated. Substance P or the selective NK- 1 receptor agonist [Sar 9, Met(O 2) 11] substance P (25 - 500 ng close i. a.) caused a biphasic LOS response, consisting of initial brief contraction followed by prolonged, dose-dependent relaxation. Tetrodotoxin (10 micrograms/kg close i. a.) changed the biphasic response to substance P to excitation only. The neurokinin- 1 (NK- 1) receptor antagonist CP 96, 345 (0. 3 - 10 mg/kg i. v.) dose-dependently reduced the inhibitory response to substance P. The excitatory phase of the response to substance P was larger and prolonged after guanethidine (5 mg/kg, i. v.), or propranolol (1 mg/kg, i. v.). L-NAME (100 mg/kg i. v.) reduced the inhibitory phase. The selective NK- 2 receptor agonist [beta-Ala 8] neurokinin A(4 - 10) caused LOS excitation only. These data indicate that intra-oesophageal acid causes substance P release from extrinsic afferent nerve endings which activates local inhibitory pathways to the LOS via NK- 1 receptors. L.
