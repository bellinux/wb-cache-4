5|$|By 1850, {{most of the}} surface-lying gum {{had been}} picked up, and people began digging for it. The hillsides yielded shallow-buried gum (about 1m), but in the <b>swamps</b> <b>and</b> beaches, it was buried much further down (4m or below).|$|E

5|$|Her {{works are}} often characterised {{by the use}} of oval shapes {{representing}} <b>swamps</b> <b>and</b> lakes. Her palette is usually black and white, though red may be used to highlight oval forms. The dotted forms represent the ground cracking as water dries up.

5|$|The Galveston Bay Area {{is located}} on the gulf coastal plain, and its {{vegetation}} is classified as temperate grassland and marshes.

5|$|The {{mourning}} dove occupies {{a wide variety}} of open and semi-open habitats, such as urban areas, farms, prairie, grassland, and lightly wooded areas.

5|$|The term malaria {{originates}} from Medieval —"bad air"; {{the disease}} was formerly called ague or marsh fever due to its association with <b>swamps</b> <b>and</b> marshland.

5|$|Upstream of the Interstate 81 crossing, the {{watershed}} of Stafford Meadow Brook is mainly forested and mountainous, with little development. The upper reaches are completely forested, with several beaver <b>swamps</b> <b>and</b> wetlands in its floodplain. Downstream of Interstate 81, however, it transitions to a developed watershed, with commercial, industrial, and residential land uses.|$|E
5|$|A {{waterfall}} or morphologic site {{known as}} the Marshwood Slides is in the watershed of Eddy Creek. Wetlands in the watershed include the Dunmore <b>Swamps</b> <b>and</b> Marshwood. The Marshwood Reservoir {{is located in the}} upper reaches of both the Eddy Creek watershed and the Little Roaring Brook watershed. Eddy Creek flows through forested land in a reach downstream of US Route 6. Other land uses include industrial land and open space.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{exist in}} {{a broad range of}} habitats, and as a major part of global ecosystems, may {{represent}} about 20% of microbial cells in the oceans. The first-discovered archaeans were extremophiles. Indeed, some archaea survive high temperatures, often above , as found in geysers, black smokers, and oil wells. Other common habitats include very cold habitats and highly saline, acidic, or alkaline water. However, archaea include mesophiles that grow in mild conditions, in <b>swamps</b> <b>and</b> marshland, sewage, the oceans, the intestinal tract of animals, and soils.|$|E

5|$|Hippo {{defecation}} creates allochthonous {{deposits of}} organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function. A 2015 study suggests that hippo dung provides nutrients from terrestrial material for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can {{have a significant impact}} on the land across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. Over prolonged periods, hippos can divert the paths of <b>swamps</b> <b>and</b> channels.|$|E
5|$|Initially, sauropods {{were thought}} to be mainly aquatic, inhabiting lush peat <b>swamps</b> <b>and</b> being captive to the {{buoyancy}} of water to support their giant body weights. In 1984, Cooper pointed out that Vulcanodon, the most primitive sauropod known at that time, lived in a desert like environment and therefore must have been terrestrial. This indicated that the large body size of sauropods, as already seen in Vulcanodon, had not evolved as an adaptation to an aquatic life style.|$|E

5|$|Much of Harveys Creek is in a forested gorge, {{which is}} {{situated}} in its lower reaches. The upper reaches of its watershed contain <b>swamps</b> <b>and</b> glacial lakes. The cliffs of Tilbury Knob are also situated {{near the mouth of}} the creek. The creek's source is in Harveys Lake, which is the largest natural lake in Pennsylvania. It flows in a generally southward direction.|$|E
5|$|Next is the Menefee Formation, {{the middle}} {{formation}} whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales, siltstones, and sandstones. These were deposited in semi-marine environments of brackish water, such as <b>swamps</b> <b>and</b> lagoons. Due to its depositional {{environment and the}} organic material in its composition, there are thin coal seams running through the Menefee Formation. At the top, this formation is intruded upon by the Cliff House Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|Rallidae is a {{large family}} of small to {{medium-sized}} birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. Typically, family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, <b>swamps</b> <b>and</b> rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak flyers.|$|E
