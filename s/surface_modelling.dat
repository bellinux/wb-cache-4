40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} one year hourly solar {{radiation}} data are analyzed and modeled using a novel visualization method. Using a 2 -D(Dimensional) surface fitting approach, the general {{behavior of the}} solar radiation in a year is modeled. By {{the help of the}} newly adopted visualization approach, a total of 9 analytical <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> are obtained and compared. The Gaussian <b>surface</b> <b>model</b> with proper model parameters is found to be the most accurate model among the tested analytical models for data characterization purposes. The accuracy of this <b>surface</b> <b>model</b> is tested and compared with a dynamic <b>surface</b> <b>model</b> obtained from a feed-forward Neural Network (NN). Analytical <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> and NN <b>surface</b> <b>model</b> are compared in the sense of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). It is obtained that the NN <b>surface</b> <b>model</b> gives better results with smaller RMSE values. However, unlike the specificity of the NN <b>surface</b> <b>model,</b> the analytical <b>surface</b> <b>model</b> provides a simple, intuitive and more generalized form that can be suitable for several geographical locations on earth...|$|R
40|$|For diagnosis, {{intervention}} planning, {{and medical}} education {{it is common}} to extract <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> from clinical tomography data. Surface extraction suffers from various effects of medical imaging, segmentation, and surface extraction techniques which cause visual disturbing surface artifacts (e. g. stairs, plateaus). Basic mesh smoothing algorithms for such <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> are a common feature of visualization toolkits. However, there exists no study concerning efficiency, accuracy, and appropriateness of different smoothing strategies for <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> derived from medical volume data. To enable an elaborated and target oriented smoothing of medical <b>surface</b> <b>models,</b> we analyze and compare fundamental mesh smoothing algorithms applied to medical <b>surface</b> <b>models.</b> Based on the analysis of artifact sources and the classification of frequent object types that may make different demands on smoothing, we present smoothing recommendations for medical <b>surface</b> <b>models.</b> ...|$|R

Thus, <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> of male urogenital organs can be effectively applied to an interactive computer simulation and contribute to the clinical practice of urologists. To create high-quality <b>surface</b> <b>models,</b> the urogenital organs and other neighboring structures were outlined in 464 sectioned images of the Visible Korean male using Adobe Photoshop; the outlines were interpolated on Discreet Combustion; then an almost automatic volume reconstruction followed by surface reconstruction was performed on 3 D-DOCTOR.

For this purpose, a program was developed to robustly extract those morphometric parameters from the thirty training <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> (training population), from the seventeen <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> reconstructed from X-ray radiographs, and from the seventeen ground truth <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> obtained either by a CT-scan reconstruction method or by a laser-scan reconstruction method. A statistical analysis was then performed to classify the seventeen test bones into two categories: normal cases and outliers. This classification step depends on the measured parameters of the particular test bone. In case all parameters of a test bone were covered by the training population's parameter ranges, this bone is classified as normal bone, otherwise as outlier bone. Our experimental results showed that statistically {{there was no significant difference}} between the morphometric parameters extracted from the reconstructed <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> of the normal cases and those extracted from the reconstructed <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> of the outliers. Therefore, our statistical shape model based reconstruction technique can be used to reconstruct not only the <b>surface</b> <b>model</b> of a normal bone but also that of an outlier bone...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{software}} tool for earth <b>surface</b> <b>modeling</b> {{of climate change}} through high-accuracy and high-speed methods are presented here. Environmental variables including temperature, rainfall and soil property constitute critical driving factors of ecosystem modeling. However, {{there are a couple}} of challenges behind modeling environmental factors including heterogeneity of multiple data sets. To handle compatibility between heterogeneous data sets, the modeling process need to represent environmental data in grid cells with earth <b>surface</b> <b>modeling.</b> However, there are error problems in classical methods of <b>surface</b> <b>modeling.</b> Furthermore, there is still limited experience in developing multi-scale <b>surface</b> <b>modeling</b> tool of climate change for ecosystem modeling. High-accuracy and high-speed methods for <b>surface</b> <b>modeling</b> (HASM) were used to solve error problems, improve the accuracy of spatial distribution simulation of environmental variables and handling muti-scale information. However, HASM which is more theoretically perfect and more complicated than other classical methods of <b>surface</b> <b>modeling.</b> This tool decompose the HASM modeling process into several components including HASM initial field, HASM optimistic controller and HASM iterative solver. HASM can opt remote sensing images or existing short precision grid data for initial field and can also simulate filed when lacking of initial fields. HASM optimistic controller need to get knowledge from environmental database to generate controlling condition rulers ensuring modeling more reasonable and more precision. HASM iterative solver is responsible for solution of HASM by means of integration of various solve methods which we have developed. Rather than linking environmental data with these modeling components, a supermatic <b>surface</b> <b>modeling</b> approach ensuring effective information exchange components is also designed for HASM. This software is easily applied to the development of ecosystem <b>modeling</b> integrated with <b>surface</b> <b>modeling.</b> This study from this integration is also helpful for future researches that aim to integrate <b>surface</b> <b>modeling</b> and ecosystem modeling...|$|R
