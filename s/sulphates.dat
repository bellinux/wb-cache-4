The main product of <b>sulphate</b> reducing bacterial oxidative metabolism, hydrogen sulphide, is potentially toxic. Although it is generally believed that the <b>sulphate</b> ion is poorly absorbed, there are no available data on how much <b>sulphate</b> reaches the colon nor on the relative contributions from diet and endogenous sources. To resolve these questions, balance studies were performed on six healthy ileostomists and three normal subjects chosen {{because they did not}} have detectable <b>sulphate</b> reducing bacteria in their faeces. The subjects were fed diets which varied in <b>sulphate</b> content from 1. 6 - 16. 6 mmol/day. <b>Sulphate</b> was measured in diets, faeces (ileal effluent in ileostomists), and urine by anion exchange chromatography with conductivity detection. Overall there was net absorption of dietary <b>sulphate,</b> with the absorptive capacity of the gastrointestinal tract plateauing at 5 mmol/day in the ileostomists and exceeding 16 mmol/day in the normal subjects.

Cell surface proteoglycans are known to mediate many aspects of cell behaviour including cell adhesion, control of extracellular matrix deposition, cell proliferation, cell migration, leukocyte adhesion and modulation of growth factor activity. This paper describes the first investigation into the distribution and function of the three main classes of proteoglycans on human corneal endothelium. Immuno-gold labelling techniques were used at the light, scanning and transmission electron microscope level to localise heparan <b>sulphate,</b> chondroitin <b>sulphate</b> and keratan <b>sulphate</b> proteoglycans on human corneal endothelium. Human corneas were freeze-wounded and kept in organ culture for 3 days in order to study the distribution of proteoglycans on migrating corneal endothelium. An Optimas image analysis system was used to quantify the change in proteoglycan labelling during cell migration. Labelling for chondroitin <b>sulphate</b> and heparan <b>sulphate</b> was at very low levels on normal corneal endothelium while keratan <b>sulphate</b> labelling was at high levels.

2500|$|In 1703 Georg Ernst Stahl, {{professor}} of medicine and chemistry at Halle, proposed a variant of the theory in which he renamed Becher's terra pinguis to phlogiston, and it was in this form that the theory probably had its greatest influence. The term phlogiston itself was not something that Stahl invented. There is evidence that the word was used as early as 1606, and {{in a way that was}} very similar to what Stahl was using it for. The term was derived from a Greek word meaning to inflame. The following paragraph describes Stahl's view of phlogiston well:To Stahl, metals were compounds containing phlogiston in combination with metallic oxides (calces); on ignition the phlogiston was freed from the metal leaving the oxide behind. When the oxide was heated with a substance rich in phlogiston, such as charcoal, the calx again took up phlogiston and regenerated the metal. Phlogiston was a definite substance, the same in all its combinations.Stahl's first definition of phlogiston first appeared in his [...] "Zymotechnia fundamentalis", published in 1697. His most quoted definition was found in the treatise on chemistry entitled [...] "Fundamenta chymiae" [...] in 1723. According to Stahl, phlogiston was a substance that was not able to be put into a bottle, but could be transferred nonetheless. To him, wood was just a combination of ash and phlogiston, and making a metal was as simple as getting a metal calx and adding phlogiston. Soot was almost pure phlogiston, which is why heating it with a metallic calx transforms the calx into the metal and Stahl attempted to prove that the phlogiston in soot and sulphur were identical by converting <b>sulphates</b> to liver of sulphur using charcoal. He did not account for the increase in weight on combustion of tin and lead that were known at the time.|$|E

40|$|Smooth muscle cells {{isolated}} from neonatal rat hearts synthesize and secrete radioactively labelled proteoglycans into two distinct extracellular compartments, the pericellular (cell surface/matrix layer) {{and the culture}} medium (extracellular). Cultures grown {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid synthesize proteoglycans that are more highly <b>sulphated</b> than those produced in the absence of ascorbate. The glycosaminoglycan chains associated with the proteoglycans synthesized by rat smooth muscle cells were heparan <b>sulphate,</b> chondroitin <b>sulphate</b> and dermatan <b>sulphate.</b> There was no evidence for the synthesis of hyaluronic acid by these cells. Most of the heparan <b>sulphate</b> was found {{to be associated with the}} pericellular and intracellular compartments, whereas the extracellular compartment contained the bulk of the chondroitin <b>sulphate.</b> In the presence of ascorbate there was an increase in dermatan <b>sulphate</b> content of the pericellular compartment at the expense of heparan <b>sulphate,</b> whilst in the absence of ascorbate the heparan <b>sulphate</b> content of this compartment was significantly increased. Hyaluronic acid and the antibiotic Tunicamycin had no effect on the biosynthesis of <b>sulphated</b> macromolecules produced by the rat smooth muscle cells. However, p-nitrophenyl-β-D-xyloside increased by 10 -fold the amount of radioactive <b>sulphate</b> incorporation into macromolecules in the extracellular compartment. This increase was due to increased sulphation of glycosaminoglycan chains synthesized in the presence of the exogenous acceptor, as evidenced by the sulphate/ uronate ratio of these <b>sulphated</b> macromolecules. Furthermore, heparan <b>sulphate</b> secretion into the extracellular compartment was decreased whilst dermatan <b>sulphate</b> increased in the presence of xyloside. Pulse-chase experiments with radioactive <b>sulphate</b> were used to study the pathways and kinetics of secretion in the rat smooth muscle cell system. The data from these studies are consistent with a very rapid intracellular sulphation mechanism followed by rapid secretion to the pericellular compartment of macromolecular <b>sulphated</b> proteoglycans. Subsequently some of these molecules then travel to the extracellular compartment. The time that different proteoglycan species remain associated with the pericellular compartment is influenced by the different matrix connective tissue proteins found in this compartment as a result of ascorbate supplementation or deprivation. During the course of these investigations, it was observed that the pericellular compartment contributed to catabolism of <b>sulphated</b> macromolecules. The <b>sulphated</b> proteoglycans associated with this compartment are acted upon by a sulphatase or sulphatases to give rise to free radioactive inorganic <b>sulphate</b> and macromolecules which have been desulphated. That this process occurs in the pericellular compartment only was proven by the use of intracellular lysomotrophic inhibitors and by the continuous exposure of <b>sulphate</b> labelled macromolecules to the extracellular extract. Neither resulted in the release of radiolabelled inorganic <b>sulphate</b> from <b>sulphated</b> macromolecules...|$|R
40|$|Polysaccharides from Pleurotus eryngii (PEPS) and exopolysaccharides from Streptococcus thermophilus ASCC 1275 (ST 1275 EPS) were <b>sulphated,</b> and {{antioxidant}} and antibacterial {{activities of}} <b>sulphated</b> and crude polysaccharides were determined. Degree of sulphonation of PEPS and ST 1275 EPS was 0. 69 and 0. 31, respectively. Characteristic bands in FT-IR spectra {{indicated that the}} <b>sulphate</b> group was at the C 6 position of the galactose skeleton. Antioxidant activities of PEPS and ST 1275 EPS were significantly (P < 0. 05) improved after sulphonation. For tested crude and <b>sulphated</b> polysaccharides, <b>sulphated</b> PEPS had the largest inhibition zone against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus CMCC 26003 while <b>sulphated</b> ST 1275 EPS had the largest inhibition zone against Listeria monocytogenes CMCC 54001. Furthermore, <b>sulphated</b> PEPS had the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for E. coli ATCC 25922, and both <b>sulphated</b> PEPS and <b>sulphated</b> ST 1275 EPS had the lowest MICs on S. aureus CMCC 26003 and L. monocytogenes CMCC 54001...|$|R
