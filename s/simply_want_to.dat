25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will <b>simply</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{said the}} film carried a more {{philosophical}} {{portrait of the}} science fiction genre than did other films, but still managed [...] "to satisfy the cravings {{of the general public}} who <b>simply</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be entertained". Internet reviewer James Berardinelli said Contact is [...] "one of 1997's finest motion pictures, and is a forceful reminder that Hollywood is still capable of making magic." [...] Berardinelli felt the film was on par with Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968) {{to be one of the}} greatest science fiction films ever made. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle largely enjoyed the first 90 minutes of Contact but felt that director Robert Zemeckis was too obsessed with visual effects rather than cohesive storytelling for the pivotal climax.|$|E

Palin said, [...] "I've been to the Nyamgiri Hills in Orissa and seen the forces of money and power that Vedanta Resources have arrayed against a people who have occupied their land for thousands of years, who husband the forest sustainably and make no great demands on the state or the government.

Hunter, a Republican, offered this resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq in place of John Murtha's H.J.Res. 73, which called for redeployment [...] "at the earliest possible date." [...] In her prepared statement, McKinney accused the Republicans of [...] "trying to set a trap for the Democrats. A 'no' vote for this Resolution will obscure {{the fact that there is}} strong support for withdrawal of US forces from Iraq ... In voting for this bill, let me be perfectly clear that I am not saying the United States should exit Iraq without a plan. I agree with Mr. Murtha that security and stability in Iraq should be pursued through diplomacy. I <b>simply</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> vote 'yes' to an orderly withdrawal from Iraq." ...|$|E

2500|$|The third book, The Stone Dogs, {{tells the}} story of the Protracted Struggleâ€”the [...] Cold War between the Domination of the Draka and the Alliance for Democracy. There is a far more intense space race in this world, with nuclear pulse-drive interplanetary spaceships and colonies and {{military}} bases established on the Moon, on Mars and in the asteroid belt. Over a period of several decades, the Alliance secretly constructs an antimatter-driven starship for transporting 100,000 people to Alpha Centauri in the event of a Draka victory. The Draka employ the policy of [...] "No peace beyond Luna," [...] leading to frequent skirmishes in the inner solar system. It is not unknown, although extremely rare, for people from the Domination to defect to the Alliance. Citizens primarily seek asylum due to personal convictions, while serfs <b>simply</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> escape their bondage. [...] Any citizen or serf caught attempting to defect would be summarily executed, though the serf would no doubt meet a more hideous death - probably by impalement or breaking on the wheel. These defectors prove valuable to the OSS because of the unique opportunity it offers regarding gathering vital information on Drakan society, the Drakan dialect, which is notoriously difficult to acquire and master, and the Drakan fighting style which is unmatched anywhere in the Alliance.|$|E
