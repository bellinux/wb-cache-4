5|$|Seven <b>subspecies</b> of American robin are recognized. These <b>subspecies</b> intergrade and {{are only}} weakly defined.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow {{has three}} <b>subspecies.</b> The {{nominate}} <b>subspecies</b> Passer melanurus melanurus {{is found in}} eastern South Africa, east to {{the western part of}} Free State. The <b>subspecies</b> vicinus, which is sometimes included in <b>subspecies</b> melanurus, occurs from Free State east to Eastern Cape and Lesotho. The <b>subspecies</b> damarensis ranges from the extreme southern coastal areas of Angola into Namibia, Botswana and southern Zimbabwe, as well as northern South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The borders {{between the}} four <b>subspecies</b> are not sharp, because the <b>subspecies</b> interbreed. Many {{studies have been}} {{performed}} in the border regions to assess the intermediate turtles, usually by comparing the anatomical features of hybrids that result from intergradation of the classical <b>subspecies.</b> Despite the imprecision, the <b>subspecies</b> are assigned nominal ranges.|$|E
5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} is monotypic, lacking any <b>subspecies.</b> Birds {{in the south}} east of New Guinea are {{sometimes}} separated into a proposed <b>subspecies,</b> P. d. monticola, but the differences are very slight and the supposed <b>subspecies</b> are generally regarded as inseparable.|$|E
5|$|The last taxonomic {{delineation}} of the jaguar <b>subspecies</b> {{was performed}} by Pocock in 1939. Based on geographic origins and skull morphology, he recognized eight <b>subspecies.</b> However, {{he did not have}} access to sufficient specimens to critically evaluate all <b>subspecies,</b> and he expressed doubt about the status of several. Later consideration of his work suggested only three <b>subspecies</b> should be recognized.|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} most of the <b>subspecies</b> overlap a little, with three in the United States or Canada. The West Indian <b>subspecies</b> is found {{throughout}} the Greater Antilles. It has recently invaded the Florida Keys. The eastern <b>subspecies</b> is found mainly in eastern North America, as well as Bermuda and the Bahamas. The western <b>subspecies</b> is found in western North America, including parts of Mexico. The Panamanian <b>subspecies</b> is located in Central America. The Clarion Island <b>subspecies</b> is found only on Clarion Island, just off the Pacific coast of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} <b>subspecies</b> are often poorly differentiated, {{and may be}} at a {{flexible}} stage of <b>subspecies</b> formation with features related to the ambient temperature, the colour tone of the local habitat, {{and the size of}} available prey. Consequently, various authors have historically described between 10 and 15 <b>subspecies.</b> The currently recognised <b>subspecies</b> are listed below.|$|E
5|$|The two <b>subspecies</b> {{are similar}} in coloration, but differ {{in the shade of}} the cap. The {{northern}} <b>subspecies,</b> living in Central Pacific Costa Rica, has a lighter cap than the southern <b>subspecies,</b> which lives in Panama and in parts of Costa Rica near Panama. The southern <b>subspecies</b> also has more yellowish limbs and underparts.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen <b>subspecies</b> {{have been}} described, but only three are widely recognised, these differing {{largely in the}} colour of their underparts. The {{nominate}} <b>subspecies</b> Passer rutilans rutilans breeds in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and southeastern and central China. The <b>subspecies</b> intensior, described in 1922 by Walter Rothschild from Yunnan, breeds in southwest China and parts of India, Burma, Laos, and Vietnam. In {{a large part of}} Sichuan intensior intergrades with the nominate <b>subspecies,</b> and a number of <b>subspecies</b> names have been proposed for the intergrades. The <b>subspecies</b> cinnamomeus, described by Gould from the northwestern Himalayas, breeds from northern Arunachal Pradesh to Nuristan in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Three <b>subspecies</b> were {{identified}} by Goldman in 1935, M.p. columbiana, M.p. pacifica, and M.p. pennanti. Later research has debated whether these <b>subspecies</b> could be positively identified. In 1959, E.M. Hagmeier concluded that the <b>subspecies</b> are not separable based on either fur or skull characteristics. Although some debate still exists, in general it is recognized that the fisher is a monotypic species with no extant <b>subspecies.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of <b>subspecies</b> have been named, of which 12 were {{recognised}} in the Handbook of the Birds of the World. These <b>subspecies</b> are divided into two groups, the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group, and the Oriental P. d. indicus group. Several Middle Eastern <b>subspecies,</b> including P. d. biblicus, are sometimes considered a third, intermediate group. The <b>subspecies</b> P. d. indicus {{was described as a}} species, and was considered to be distinct by many ornithologists during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|A. c. woodwardi Mathews, 1912 â€“ {{southwest}} and south-central Australia {{west of the}} Mount Lofty Ranges. This <b>subspecies</b> is a little smaller than the nominate <b>subspecies</b> and has shorter wings. Its plumage is similar though the yellow patch on the belly is more prominent.|$|E
5|$|A. m. sigillatum:The {{traditional}} 'southern' <b>subspecies</b> (A. m. sigillatum) {{does not}} register a mitochondrial genetic identity. This <b>subspecies</b> was identified by Ferguson as forming an integrade with A. m. columbianum {{in south central}} Oregon.|$|E
5|$|A. r. sanctorum was {{described}} by van Rossem in 1947. It {{was found on the}} Todos Santos Islands off the coast of northwest Baja California. This <b>subspecies</b> is believed to be extinct. This is the darkest of the coastal <b>subspecies,</b> especially on its underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Across its Central Asian distribution, the saxaul sparrow {{occurs in}} six {{probably}} disjunct areas, and {{is divided into}} at least three <b>subspecies.</b> The nominate <b>subspecies</b> Passer ammodendri ammodendri inhabits three of these areas, one in the Syr Darya basin of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and another {{to the south of}} Lake Balkhash and the north of Almaty, where it is only common in the valley of the Ili River. In a third area, sometimes recognised as a <b>subspecies</b> korejewi, ammodendri birds breed sporadically in parts of central Turkmenistan, Iran, and possibly Afghanistan, migrating to the south during the winter. The <b>subspecies</b> stoliczkae was named after Ferdinand Stoliczka in 1874 by Allan Octavian Hume, from specimens Stoliczka collected in Yarkand. This <b>subspecies</b> is separated from the other two <b>subspecies</b> by the Tian Shan mountains. It is found across a broad swath of China from Kashgar east to the far west of Inner Mongolia, through the areas around the Taklamakan Desert (but probably not in the inhospitable desert itself), and through the east of Xinjiang, northern Gansu, and the fringes of southern Mongolia. In the extreme west of the Gobi Desert a disjunct population separated from the other stoliczkae birds by the Gurvan Saikhan Uul mountains occurs, which is sometimes separated as a <b>subspecies</b> timidus. The <b>subspecies</b> nigricans, described by ornithologist L. S. Stepanyan in 1961, is found in northern Xinjiang's Manasi River valley.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria varies {{considerably}} in its morphology, and many authorities recognize several <b>subspecies</b> or varieties within the species. In The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, German mycologist Rolf Singer listed three <b>subspecies,</b> though without description: A.muscaria ssp. muscaria, A.muscaria ssp. americana, and A.muscaria ssp. flavivolvata.|$|E
5|$|An {{isolated}} {{population in}} the Laptev Sea is considered by some authorities, including many Russian biologists and the canonical Mammal Species of the World, to be a third <b>subspecies,</b> O. r. laptevi (Chapskii, 1940), and is managed as such in Russia. Where the <b>subspecies</b> separation is not accepted, whether to consider it a subpopulation of the Atlantic or Pacific <b>subspecies</b> remained under debate until 2009, when multiple lines of molecular evidence showed it to represent the westernmost population of the Pacific walrus.|$|E
5|$|As {{would be}} {{expected}} for a widespread passerine bird species, several geographical <b>subspecies</b> are recognised. The treatment of <b>subspecies</b> in this article follows Clement et al. (2000).|$|E
5|$|Asian <b>subspecies</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as the maral, but this name applies primarily to the Caspian red deer (Cervus elaphus maral), a <b>subspecies</b> of red deer. There is a <b>subspecies</b> of elk in Mongolia called the Altai wapiti (Cervus canadensis sibiricus), also known as the Altai maral.|$|E
5|$|Banksia integrifolia subsp. compar: This <b>subspecies</b> {{grows in}} coastal Queensland {{as far north}} as Proserpine. For most of its range it is the only <b>subspecies,</b> but near its {{southern}} limit it co-occurs with B.integrifolia subsp. integrifolia. The two <b>subspecies</b> are distinguishable by their leaves, which are larger and glossy with wavy margins on B.integrifolia subsp. compar.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{named for}} Ridgway include the buff-collared nightjar, Caprimulgus ridgwayi (once known as Ridgway's whip-poor-will); the {{turquoise}} cotinga, Cotinga ridgwayi; the Caribbean <b>subspecies</b> of the osprey, Pandion haliaetus ridgwayi; a Big Island <b>subspecies</b> of the elepaio, Chasiempis sandwichensis ridgwayi; Ridgway's hawk, Buteo ridgwayi; {{and many other}} species and <b>subspecies.</b> The monotypic genus Ridgwayia is named for him; it consists of Aztec thrush, R. pinicola.|$|E
5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern <b>subspecies,</b> {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep. This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals, which can be an important source of food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern <b>subspecies</b> was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western <b>subspecies,</b> which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E
5|$|Current {{taxonomy}} recognises four subspecies: M. s. splendens in Western Australia, M. s. musgravei {{in central}} Australia (<b>subspecies</b> previously recognised as M. s. callainus), M. s. melanotus in inland eastern Australia and M. s. emmottorum in southwestern Queensland. Initially, {{the three were}} considered separate species as they were described far from their borders with other <b>subspecies.</b> However, as the interior of Australia was explored, it became apparent there were areas of hybridisation where <b>subspecies</b> overlapped. Thus in 1975, the first three forms below were reclassified as <b>subspecies</b> of Malurus splendens.|$|E
5|$|Currently, four <b>subspecies</b> of ringneck are recognised, all {{of which}} have been {{described}} as distinct species in the past: (As of 1993, the twenty-eight and Cloncurry parrot were treated as <b>subspecies</b> of the Port Lincoln parrot and the mallee ringneck, respectively).|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of call similarity {{suggests that the}} Asiatic and Ethiopian races diverged from the western <b>subspecies</b> early in evolutionary history, and that Italian red-billed choughs are more closely allied to the North African <b>subspecies</b> than {{to those of the}} rest of Europe.|$|E
5|$|E. c. griseigularis {{is found}} in southwestern New Guinea and Cape York, and was {{described}} in 1909 by Dutch naturalist Eduard van Oort. It is {{much smaller than the}} other <b>subspecies.</b> The original name for this <b>subspecies</b> was harteri, but the type specimen, collected in Cooktown, was found to be an intergrade form. The new type was collected from Merauke. This <b>subspecies</b> intergrades with cyanotis {{at the base of the}} Cape York Peninsula, and the zone of intermediate forms is narrow. The white wing patch is larger than that of cyanotis and smaller than that of albipennis. Only one bird (from Cape York) of this <b>subspecies</b> was sampled in a molecular study, and it was shown to be genetically close to cyanotis.|$|E
5|$|English {{botanist}} and explorer Allan Cunningham collected what {{he called}} Grevillea sulphurea in 1822 near Coxs River in the Bathurst area, where it grew alongside G.rosmarinifolia and G.arenaria <b>subspecies</b> canescens. This was later synonymised with G.juniperina, before being recognised as a distinct <b>subspecies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Females can lay five {{clutches}} per year, but two is {{a normal}} average after including the 30â€“50% of a population's females that do not produce any clutches in a given year. In some northern populations, no females lay more than one clutch per year. Bigger females tend to lay bigger eggs and more eggs per clutch. Clutch sizes of the <b>subspecies</b> vary, although the differences may reflect different environments, rather than different genetics. The two more northerly <b>subspecies,</b> western and midland, are larger and have more eggs per clutchâ€”11.9 and 7.6, respectivelyâ€”than the two more southerly <b>subspecies,</b> southern (4.2) and eastern (4.9). Within <b>subspecies,</b> also, the more northerly females lay larger clutches.|$|E
5|$|Four <b>subspecies</b> {{described}} in Asia include the Altai wapiti (C. canadensis sibiricus) and the Tianshan wapiti (C. canadensis songaricus). Two distinct <b>subspecies</b> found in China and Korea are the Manchurian wapiti (C. canadensis xanthopygus) and the Alashan wapitis (C. canadensis alashanicus). The Manchurian wapiti is darker and more reddish in coloration {{than the other}} populations. The Alashan wapiti of north central China is the smallest of all <b>subspecies,</b> has the lightest coloration and is the least studied. Biologist Valerius Geist, who has written on the world's various deer species, holds {{that there are only}} three <b>subspecies</b> of elk. Geist recognizes the Manchurian and Alashan wapiti but places all other elk into C. canadensis canadensis, claiming that classification of the four surviving North American groups as <b>subspecies</b> is driven, at least partly, for political purposes to secure individualized conservation and protective measures for each of the surviving populations.|$|E
5|$|He is {{responsible}} for describing one <b>subspecies</b> of black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), the southern black-and-white ruffed lemur (V. v. editorum) in 1952; one <b>subspecies</b> of toque macaque (Macaca sinica), the highland toque macaque (M. s. opisthomelas) in 1942; one <b>subspecies</b> of red slender loris (Loris tardigradus), the Horton Plains slender loris (L. t. nycticeboides) in 1942; and two <b>subspecies</b> of grey slender loris (Loris lydekkerianus), the highland slender loris (L. l. grandis) in 1932 and the dry zone slender loris (L. l. nordicus) in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{confluence}} of the Vohimara and Antainambalana Rivers may have been a zone of hybridization between these two species, although no conclusive results have indicated current interbreeding. In general, the Antainambalana River appears to isolate the red ruffed lemurs from the neighboring <b>subspecies</b> of black-and-white ruffed lemur, V. v. subcincta. The <b>subspecies</b> V. v. variegata can be found further south, and V. v. editorum is the southernmost <b>subspecies.</b> The ranges of these two southern <b>subspecies</b> overlap and intermediate forms are reported to exist, although this has not been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In a 2012 {{review of}} {{pinniped}} taxonomy, Berta and Morgan Churchill suggested that, based on morphological and genetic criteria, there are 33 extant species and 29 <b>subspecies</b> of pinnipeds, although {{five of the}} latter lack sufficient support to be conclusively considered <b>subspecies.</b> They recommend that the genus Arctocephalus be limited to Arctocephalus pusillus, and they resurrected the name Arctophoca for several species and <b>subspecies</b> formerly placed in Arctocephalus. More than 50 fossil species have been described.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} skull length, the {{smallest}} <b>subspecies</b> {{of the blue}} wildebeest is the western white-bearded wildebeest. It is also the darkest <b>subspecies,</b> the eastern white-bearded wildebeest being the lightest race. Both these <b>subspecies</b> possess a creamy white beard, whereas the beard is black in both the Nyassaland wildebeest and the common wildebeest. The longest muzzles {{are found in the}} Nyassaland wildebeest, and the shortest in female western white-bearded wildebeest.|$|E
5|$|M. c. cyaneus, the {{nominate}} <b>subspecies</b> {{described in}} 1782, is found throughout Tasmania. Birds are larger and {{darker than the}} mainland <b>subspecies,</b> with males having a deeper azure blue coloration. Schodde in his 1982 review reclassified elizabethae and samueli under cyaneus.|$|E
5|$|M. l. dulcis, {{commonly}} known as lavender-flanked fairywren, is found in Arnhem Land. It was described in 1908 by amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews, though this and <b>subspecies</b> rogersi were long considered forms of the lovely fairywren (M. amabilis) until integrades were noted over a wide area of northern Australia with <b>subspecies</b> assimilis. Like <b>subspecies</b> rogersi, females are predominantly blue-grey rather than grey-brown and have white lores and eye rings rather than the rufous coloration of the other <b>subspecies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Measurements for the russet sparrow vary geographically, {{between the}} three <b>subspecies,</b> and also within the Himalayan <b>subspecies</b> cinnamomeus. The <b>subspecies</b> cinnamomeus is {{generally}} larger than the others, and within this form {{there is a tendency}} for birds at higher altitudes to be larger, and a clinal variation in size with the smallest birds in the west of the range and the largest in the east.|$|E
