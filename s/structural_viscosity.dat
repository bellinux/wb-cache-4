The used approach is based on the decomposition of the macroscopic Green-Kubo stress correlation function into the correlation functions between the atomic level stresses. Previously we used the approach to study an iron-like single component system of particles. The role of vibrational motion has been addressed through the demonstration of the relationship between viscosity and the shear waves propagating over large distances. In our previous considerations, however, we did not discuss the role of the structural relaxation. Here we suggest that the contribution to <b>viscosity</b> from the <b>structural</b> relaxation can be taken into account through the consideration of the contribution from the atomic stress auto-correlation term only. This conclusion, however, does not mean that only the auto-correlation term represents the contribution to <b>viscosity</b> from the <b>structural</b> relaxation. Previously the role of the <b>structural</b> relaxation for <b>viscosity</b> has been addressed through the considerations of the transitions between inherent structures and within the mode-coupling theory by other authors. In the present work, we study the structural relaxation through the considerations of the parent liquid and the atomic level stress correlations in it. The comparison with the results obtained on the inherent structures also is made. Our results suggest that in the supercooled liquid regime the vibrational contribution to viscosity extends over the times which are much larger than the Einstein's vibrational period and much larger than the times which it takes for the shear waves to propagate over the model systems. Besides addressing the atomic level shear stress correlations, we also studied correlations between the atomic level pressure elements. Comment: 16 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

In the framework of the approach different internal dissipative channels of energy are taken in account in an explicit form, namely, the thermal channel and channels of defect subsystems. The identity has a perfect differential form what permits to introduce an extended non-equilibrium state and use the good developed mathematical formalism of equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The evolution of non-equilibrium variables of a physical system are described by a Landau-based equation set expressed through internal or different kinds of free energy connected by means of the Legendre transforms. The accordance between the different kinds of energy is possible owing to introduction of some trends into the equation subset described the defect subsystems and having a nature of <b>structural</b> <b>viscosity.</b> The possibilities of the approach are illustrated on the example of quasibrittle solid damage and failure. Taking into account only one type of defects (viz., microcracks) and mechanical parameters in an expansion of free energy down to third powers in relative to average energy per microcrack, the description of destruction of quasi-brittle solids during long-term loading is considered. The consideration allows to find equilibrium and non-equilibrium values of the free energy. A qualitative behavior of the system on parameters of the theory is analyzed.

The PGN systems are found to have less <b>structural</b> order, lower <b>viscosity,</b> and faster diffusivity with increasing length of the grafted chains for a given core concentration or grafting density. Decreasing grafting density causes depletion effects associated with the chains leading to close contacts between some particle cores.

Technology of thermic rock melting for trenching of tenous vertical works. One task in the scope of above investigation was to experimentally verify the properties of melts of various types of works. An important moment in the trenching of tenuous vertical works by rock melting is the ability of melt to penetrate into the rock cracks. From this point of view an important physical property of molten rock is its viscosity. There are various methods how to measure viscosity but for the continuous measurements just some of them are suitable. The most suitable is rotary viscosimeter because it is simple in its construction, it allows to measure the viscosity as a function of temperature, concentration of wide class of sub stances with different rheologic properties.

Now comprehensive physicochemical and pharmacological study of the dosage form are going on. This paper presents results of determining the critical parameters of technology of suppositories witn Glifazin produced by molding - temperature control of homogenization and molding of suppository mass. This mode, as shown in the work, grounded on the analysis of rheological behavior of the system in the temperature range in which it is the transition from the liquid state of Newtonian type flow to the plastic-bound state of non- Newtonian flow type. This interval for suppository mass with Glifazin is in the range 45 - 60 ° C. Materials and methods. As the object of the study the suppositories with Glifazin 0. 1 g and polietylenoxide base on which they are prepared were taken. The study of structural and mechanical (rheological) properties of suppository base and suppository mass were performed on a rotary viscometer «Reotest- 2 " (Germany) with coaxial cylinders and the temperature range 45 - 60 °C. Determination of hardening temperature, resistance of suppositories to decay and their dissolution time were measured by methods of the State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine. Determination of uniformity suppository mass was assessed by quantitative content of Glifazin in selected samples by using UV spectrophotometry method at 271 nm against a standard sample of Onozid. Results and discussion. The analysis of rheogram shows that the suppository mass with Glifazin in the test temperature range has falseplastice type of flow. The presence of hysteresis loops indicates that this system has dispersed thixotropic properties. Thus, an increase in temperature leads to a decrease in the area of the hysteresis loop and at 60 °C type flow close to Newton. Adding of Glifazin into a suppository basis significantly changes its reoparameters - increases <b>structural</b> <b>viscosity</b> and increases thixotropic properties of system, due to the influence of the concentration of solids in the system, resulting in reduced her mobility. So important when justifying production technology suppositories is an optimal temperature casting of suppository mass. Other important technological factors whose influence was investigated in this study were speed and time of mixing suppository mass. The result of the research was the study of temperature, speed and time of mixing of suppository mass that is moving but, because of the structuring system started, the processes of sedimentation of solid phase is not occurring, and suppositories prepared in all respects comply with State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine. Conclusions. 1. The structural and mechanical properties of suppository poliethylenoxide bases and suppositories with vegetable substance Glifazin in the temperature range from 45 °C to 60 ° C were studied. 2. Influence of temperature, speed and time of mixing suppository mass on the rheological properties and basic properties of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing suppositories were studied. It is shown that homogenization of suppository mass with the rotation speed mixers 0. 9 s- 1 at 55 ° C for 1 h gives a suppository that meet the requirements of SPU. 3.

Methods: We have extended the experimental conditions of the accepted model for NADPH-oxidase activity, the so-called cell-free assay, to a large temperature range (10 – 40 °C) using different membrane compositions (subcellular compartments or liposomes). Results: A remarkable increase of superoxide production rate was observed with rising temperature.

The aim of this acute breakfast intervention {{study was to determine}} the effect of consumption of sourdough-fermented and unfermented rye crispbread on self-rated appetite, postprandial glucose and insulin response in healthy subjects. In all, twenty-four Swedish adults were included in a single-blinded, randomised cross-over trial. Three crispbreads (sourdough-fermented and unfermented whole grain rye and yeast-fermented refined wheat as control) were consumed as part of a standardised breakfast. Subjective appetite score, assessed using visual analogue scale, and plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured at baseline and postprandially until 360 and 240 min, respectively. <b>Structural</b> changes and <b>viscosity</b> during mastication and gastric digestion were investigated using in vitro methods. Hunger and desire to eat were lower (P< 005) based on AUC measurements after intake of sourdough-fermented rye crispbread compared with after intake of yeast-fermented refined wheat crispbread. On the basis of AUC (0 - 230 min), insulin response was lowest after intake of unfermented rye crispbread compared with sourdough-fermented rye and yeast-fermented refined wheat crispbread. Degradation of viscous fibres and faster bolus disintegration for the sourdough-fermented bread may partly explain the less favourable metabolic responses compared with unfermented bread. Our results showed that food processing affects the composition and structural characteristics of rye bread, which has implications for appetite and metabolic responses...|$|R

A thorough understanding is required of the mechanisms underlying the connection between mix-design and fresh state performance, on one hand, and the dispersion and orientation of the fibers on the other hand, also in the context with monitoring and prediction to achieve the anticipated structural performance.

40|$|The low {{temperature}} viscosity {{in the range}} of 10 7 ~ 10 11 poises was measured using the penetration viscometer for glasses of the series xNa 2 O・(10 -x) K 2 O・ 90 B 2 O 3, xNa 2 O・(20 -x) K 2 O・ 80 B 2 O 3, xLi 2 O・(10 -x) K 2 O・ 90 B 2 O 3, xLi 2 O・(20 -x) K 2 O・ 80 B 2 O 3 and xNaKO・(100 -x) B 2 O 3 prepared by melting in vacuum. The temperature dependence of viscosty was expressed by the Arrhenius type equation. Generally, viscosity and activation energy for viscous flow of the glass melted in vacuum were higher than those of the glass melted in air. The most pronounced finding was absence of the "mixed alkali effect" in viscosity no marked minimum was observed on the curves relating log viscosity with the alkali ratio R/(R+R'), in contrast with the general belief based on the fact the log viscosity isotherms of Na 2 O-K 2 O-SiO 2 and other glasses showed a pronaunced minimum. In other words, the minimum would be present only in a limited number of systems. As to variation of viscosity with the total alkali content, it was found that viscosity of xNaKO・(100 -x) B 2 O 3 glasses shows a maximum at 25 mol% alkali oxide in the same fashion as single alkali borate glasses. These results would imply that the <b>structural</b> interpretation of <b>viscosity</b> of mixed alkali glasses could be based on the structural concept developed for single alkali glasses...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{efforts to}} deal with the {{complexities}} of the liquid state, particularly those of glassforming systems, have focused on the "energy landscape" as a means of dealing with the collective variables problem [1]. The "basins of attraction" that constitute the landscape features in configuration space represent a distinct class of microstates of the system. So far only the microstates that are related to <b>structural</b> relaxation and <b>viscosity</b> have been considered in this paradigm. But most of the complex systems of importance in nature and industry are solutions, particularly solutions that are highly non-ideal in character. In these, a distinct class of fluctuations exists, the fluctuations in concentration. The mean square amplitudes of these fluctuations relate to the chemical activity coefficients [2], and their rise and decay times may be much longer than those of the density fluctuations - from which they may be statistically independent. Here we provide data on the character of chemical order fluctuations in viscous liquids and on their relation to the enthalpy fluctuations that determine the structural relaxation time, and hence the glass temperature Tg. Using a spectroscopically active chemical order probe, we identify a "chemical fictive temperature", Tchm, by analogy with the familiar "fictive temperature" Tf (the cooling Tg). Like Tf, Tchm must be the same as the real temperature for the system to be in complete equilibrium. It is possible for mobile multicomponent liquids to be permanently nonergodic, insofar as Tchm > Tf = T, which must be accommodated within the landscape paradigm. We note that, in appropriate systems, an increase in concentration of slow chemically ordering units in liquids can produce a crossover to fast ion conducting glass phenomenology.

40|$|The flutter {{characteristics}} of the first AGARD standard aeroelastic configuration for dynamic response, Wing 445. 6, are studied using an unsteady Navier-Stokes algorithm in order to investigate a previously noted discrepancy between Euler flutter characteristics and the experimental data. The algorithm, which is a three-dimensional, implicit, upwind Euler/Navier-Stokes code (CFL 3 D Version 2. 1), was previously modified for the time-marching, aeroelastic analysis of wings using the unsteady Euler equations. These modifications include the incorporation of a deforming mesh algorithm {{and the addition of}} the structural equations of motion for their simultaneous time integration with the governing flow equations. In this paper, the aeroelastic method is extended and evaluated for applications that use the Navier- Stokes aerodynamics. The paper presents {{a brief description of the}} aeroelastic method and presents unsteady calculations which verify this method for Navier-Stokes calculations. A linear stability analysis and a time-marching aeroelastic analysis are used to determine the flutter {{characteristics of}} the isolated 45 deg. swept-back wing. Effects of fluid <b>viscosity,</b> <b>structural</b> damping, and number of modes in the structural model are investigated. For the linear stability analysis, the unsteady generalized aerodynamic forces of the wing are computed for a range of reduced frequencies using the pulse transfer-function approach. The flutter {{characteristics of the}} wing are determined using these unsteady generalized aerodynamic forces in a traditional V-g analysis. This stability analysis is used to determine the flutter characteristics of the wing at free-stream Mach numbers of 0. 96 and 1. 141 using the generalized aerodynamic forces generated by solving the Euler equations and the Navier-Stokes equations. Time-marching aeroelastic calculations are performed at a free-stream Mach number of 1. 141 using the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations to compare with the linear V-g flutter analysis method. The V-g analysis, which is used in conjunction with the time-marching analysis, indicates that the fluid viscosity has a significant effect on the supersonic flutter boundary for this wing while the structural damping and number of modes in the structural model have a lesser effect...|$|R

Bibliography: leaves [214]- 219. xiii, 240 l illus., tablesA {{rheological}} {{study was}} conducted on six clays with the objectives of studying the dependence of viscosity on clay concentration (water content) for important soil mineralogical groups, evaluating the effects on viscosity of chemical treatment induced by changing pH, electrolyte concentration, and composition of the exchange complex, and using interpretation, based on interparticle interactions and predictive model equations to explain observed viscosity differences. The clays were selected to represent 2 : 1 (montmorillonite and vermiculite), 1 : 1 (kaolinite and halloysite), and amorphous metal hydroxides and alumino silicate (Akaka and Choyo) <b>structural</b> types. <b>Viscosities</b> of various suspensions were measured by use of a rotational, the MacMichael, viscometer. Supporting experiments were conducted to investigate interparticle configurations by direct electron-microscopic examinations. development of gel structures was monitored by tension measurements in suspension. Results showed that: 1. The order of increasing viscosities for similar concentrations of clay in water was generally as follows: Choyo clay, vermiculite, halloysite, Akaka clay, kaolinite, and montmorillonite. 2. The presence of magnesium on the exchange complex of clays decreased the viscosities of three clay-water systems, namely montmorillonite, kaolinite, and Choyo clay in water. This was attributed to reduction {{of the extent of}} the electrical double layer around the clay particles which favored a decrease in number of particles through face-face attraction. The other three, vermiculite, ha 11 oysite, and Akaka, became more viscous when the exchange surface was saturated with Mg 2 +. 3. Addition of NaC 1 first caused a reduction in viscosity of sodium saturated montmorillonite, vermiculite, and Choyo clay suspensions. This was attributed to hydrolysis and subsequent formation of more flocculated H, A 1 -c 1 ays in the absence of electrolyte. Further increases in NaC 1 concentration resulted in increased viscosities. In contrast to these three clays, an inverse relationship existed between viscosity and NaC 1 concentration for Na-kao 1 inite and Na-Akaka clay systems. No definite effect of electrolyte concentration was noted on Na-ha 11 oysite. 4. Addition of MgC 12 to Mg-Choyo clays resulted in a viscosity increase that varied directly as the concentration of MgC 12 • Conversely, viscosities of the five other Mg-c 1 ays were inversely related to MgC 12 concentration. 5. Sodium saturated crystalline clays suspended in dilute NaC 1 generally showed viscosity highs at pH 4 and viscosity lows at pH 10. On the other hand, sodium saturated amorphous clays, had viscosity lows at pH 4. Na-Akaka clay had maximum viscosity at pH 7. The viscosity of Na-Choyo showed a continued rise to pH 10. 6. All the Mg-c 1 ays suspended in dilute MgC 12 solutions had their highest viscosity values at pH 10. However, the Mg-kao 1 inite system had essentially equal viscosities at pH 4, 7, and 10. 7. Measurable tensions of 1 - 2 cm were detected in very dilute Na-montmori 11 onite and Na-vermicu 1 ite systems indicating that interparticle configurations may occur at clay concentrations far below those necessary to form observable rigidity or gel structure. Sodium clay systems that yielded the highest viscosities required the most clay for tension response. 8. Electron micrographs of freeze-dried clay suspensions failed to reveal edge-face or edge-edge interparticle configurations. Evidence was found for face-face positioning of sheets in Na-montmorillonite that had been freeze-dried in NaCl as well as in Na-kaolinite freeze-dried in HCI...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present {{relevant}} rheological and chaotic properties of atomic liquid systems under steady planar shear (PSF) and elongational (PEF) flows, {{with the use of}} Nonequilibrium Molecular Dynamics (NEMD) techniques. These flows are widely employed in industrial applications, and, at a fundamental level, represent interesting models for the discussion of theoretical assumptions of statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory. Whereas the use of the SLLOD algorithm of NEMD for PSF has been established for more than twenty years, the simulation of PEF for arbitrarily long times has recently been made possible through the combination of the SLLOD formulation with the so-called Kraynik-Reinelt (KR) periodic boundary conditions (pbcs) for the unit cell. Firstly, aspects regarding the chaotic behaviour of these types of flow are discussed, with an analysis of the spectra of Lyapunov exponents for systems of different sizes and at a number of different state points, under Gaussian isoenergetic and isokinetic constrained dynamics. The so-called conjugate-pairing rule (CPR), which, loosely speaking, pertains to systems with a homogeneous distribution of chaoticity among internal degrees of freedom, is established for PEF, whereas robust evidence for its violation under PSF is provided. Considerations about the link between Lyapunov exponents and <b>viscosity,</b> <b>structural</b> ordering at high values of external fields and phase space contractions are also put forward. Secondly, a novel algorithm for the implementation of the Nosé-Hoover mechanism for pressure conservation for PEF systems is illustrated and used in conjunction with a Gaussian isokinetic thermostat to achieve a so-called isokinetic-isobaric (or NpT) ensemble. Accurate results for the viscosity of a simple liquid in this ensemble are obtained, and a comparison with analogous findings for the isokinetic-isochoric (NVT) regime is provided. Furthermore, the analysis of the chaotic properties for PSF and PEF systems is extended to the case of NpT constrained dynamics {{with the use of the}} above method, showing that the degrees of freedom associated with the Nosé-Hoover (NH) barostat have no influence on chaoticity, regardless of whether the underlying algorithm describing the flow is symplectic. Then, a study that shows the independence of physical properties of homogeneous systems under steady PEF from KR pbcs is carried out. Using CPR and inspecting the Lyapunov exponents associated with the conserved degrees of freedom, the dynamics of phase-space trajectories and the values of transport coefficients are proven to be insensitive to any choice of initial parameters of periodic mappings on the unit cell. Finally, some concluding remarks and suggestions for future work complete the Thesis...|$|R
