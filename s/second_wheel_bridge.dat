50|$|After {{these and}} other delays, in 1847 the legislatures of Virginia and Ohio jointly issued a new <b>Wheeling</b> <b>bridge</b> charter. Charles Ellet and John A. Roebling were invited to submit designs and {{estimates}} for a bridge over the east channel of the river to Wheeling Island. Ellett was the chief engineer of the Virginia Central Railroad and in 1853 would built a railroad over the Blue Ridge at Rock Fish Gap. The new <b>Wheeling</b> <b>bridge</b> would be of a suspension design, since Ellet and Roebling were the foremost authorities. It would also be ninety feet above low water, which would impede the largest steamboats with high stacks. Ellet received the contract award in 1847 with at bid of $120,000 (Roebling's for a shorter double-span bridge was $130,000), began the same year, and the bridge was completed in 1849 for about $250,000.|$|R

50|$|Center or <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> - {{which turns}} once per hour. Its pinion is turned by the teeth on the {{mainspring}} barrel in watches and spring driven clocks, {{and by the}} weight pulley in weight driven clocks. Its arbor projects {{through a hole in}} the face and drives, via a friction coupling, the cannon pinion, which carries the minute hand. It also drives the pinion of the third wheel. In wrist watches with centre seconds, that is with the seconds hand pivoted coaxially with the minute and hour hands, this wheel is positioned off centre to allow the fourth wheel to be placed at the centre of the movement. In this arrangement the wheel is called the <b>second</b> <b>wheel,</b> because it is still the <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> in the train but no longer at the centre of the movement.|$|R
50|$|The baghar or double jhlaar is {{used when}} the {{distance}} from water is very great, one wheel conveying the water to an intermediate reservoir where the <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> is used.|$|R

5000|$|The calibre {{was quickly}} adopted {{throughout}} France and today its basic design is what characterizes all mechanical watches. It {{is important to}} note that the term [...] "Lépine" [...] can refer to both the calibre itself or a type of pocket watch with a flat, open-faced case in which the <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> is placed in the axis of the winder shaft and the crown positioned at XII, in opposition to the savonete (or hunter-case) watch where the <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> and winder shaft are placed on perpendicular axes and the crown at III. This design has been known within the watch industry as the Lépine style ever since.|$|R

50|$|A mill {{was already}} present at Mapledurham {{at the time}} of the Domesday Book. The central section of the current mill {{building}} dates back to the 15th century. Originally the mill had a single water wheel, on the river side of the building. The mill was increased in size in the 1670s, and a leat was constructed to drive a <b>second</b> water <b>wheel</b> on the village side. It is this <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> which is still in use today.|$|R
5|$|Virginia's second Convention of 1861 was a Unionist {{response}} to the secessionist movement in Virginia. The First Wheeling Convention meeting at Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), sat on May 13–15. It called for elections to another meeting if Virginia's Ordinance of Secession were to pass referendum. After the vote was taken on May 23, the First Session of the <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention met from June 11 June 25 to establish the Restored Government of Virginia, electing Arthur I. Boreman its presiding officer. The Second Session of the <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention met from August 6 to August 21 {{to call for a}} new state from the territory of Virginia to be named Kanawha.|$|R
50|$|The ride {{comprised}} a 116-foot cross beam, {{each end}} carrying a 12-arm wheel, with a circular eight-passenger cabin suspended {{from each of}} the wheel arms. One end of the cross beam would rise approximately one hundred feet as its wheel spun in a clockwise motion. The cabins could also be spun in the horizontal plane using a central steering wheel, similar to a teacup ride. After being up in the air for several minutes, and after the <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> was loaded, the first wheel was lowered to the ground and the <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> raised in the air. When shut down, the cross beam would rest at , both wheels dangling 40-to-50 feet off the ground.|$|R

25|$|Unionist {{sentiment}} {{was so high}} in {{the northwestern}} counties that civil government began to disintegrate, and the Wheeling Intelligencer newspaper called for a convention of delegates {{to meet in the}} city of Wheeling to consider secession from the commonwealth of Virginia. Delegates duly assembled, and at the First Wheeling Convention (also known as the May Convention), held May 13 to 15, the delegates voted to hold off on secession from Virginia until Virginia formally seceded from the United States. Concerned that the irregular nature of the First Wheeling Convention might not democratically represent the will of the people, elections were scheduled for June 4 to formally elect delegates to a second convention, if necessary. Virginians voted to approve secession on May 23. On June 4, elections were held and delegates to a <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention elected. These elections were irregular as well: Some were held under military pressure, some counties sent no delegates, some delegates never appeared, and voter turnout varied significantly. On June 19, the <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention declared the offices of all government officials who had voted for secession vacant, and reconstituted the executive and legislative branches of the Virginia government from their own ranks. The <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention adjourned on June 25 with the intent of reconvening on August 6.|$|R
50|$|Ellet {{would go}} on to design the 1,010 ft <b>Wheeling</b> Suspension <b>Bridge</b> (1847-49); and the first Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge (1847-48), which was {{abandoned}} before completion.|$|R
5|$|In 2007 the {{telescope}} {{needed a new}} drive wheel, {{as one of the}} 64 original wheels had cracked; in 2008 another new steel tyre was needed after a <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> cracked. These are the only two wheel changes needed since {{the telescope}} started operation in 1957.|$|R
5000|$|Beyond {{the purported}} [...] "wagon" [...] are 2 wheels (previously {{identified}} as wagon wheels).

50|$|Fox then {{entered into}} {{partnership}} with the contractor Francis Braham to form the company Braham, Fox and Co., which when Braham retired became Fox, Henderson and Co., of London, Smethwick, and Renfrew. The company specialised in railway equipment, including <b>wheels,</b> <b>bridges,</b> roofs, cranes, tanks and permanent way materials. It also experimented with components for suspension and girder bridges, with Fox reading a paper before the Royal Society in 1865. The company was responsible for many important station roofs including Liverpool Tithebarn Street, (1849-50), Bradford Exchange (1850), Paddington and Birmingham New Street.|$|R
50|$|Pennsylvania legislators opposed federal {{legislation}} {{to authorize the}} <b>Wheeling</b> <b>bridge.</b> In 1836, Federal engineers proposed a suspension bridge with a removable section to enable clearance of steamboat smokestacks, but Congress tabled it. The U.S. postmaster's report urging a similar bridge in 1840 got lost. Another proposal requiring hinges on high steamboat smokestacks also initially failed. In 1844, a steamboat packet line began connecting Pittsburgh and Cincinnati (nearly bypassing Wheeling since the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad track would only be completed in 1853, the same year a packet line connected Wheeling and Louisville).|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is constructed}} from aluminium. The 37.5 ft wing employs a laminated aluminium spar and a NACA 4418 airfoil.

50|$|On May 5, 1990, Saturday Spin {{was changed}} to Million Dollar Spin.
