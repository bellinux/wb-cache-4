40|$|In the {{framework}} of this project, a series of platinum 4 - 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazoline complexes was produced. These complexes were tested in vitro for anti-tumour effect and {{have been found to}} exhibit anti-tumour activity in ovarian, testicular-and colon cell cultures. One complex, JS 5, trans-dichlorobis{ 2 -methyl- 3 - phenyl- 5 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 4 - 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazoline}platinum(II), trans-[PtCl 2 {N=C(p-HO-C 6 H 4) - 0 -N(Me) -CH(Ph) } 2] (product 45), proved to be twice as effective as carboplatin and also showed good activity in carboplatin resistant cell lines. Another complex JS 6, trans-dichloro(4 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) benzonitrile) { 2 - methyl- 3 -phenyl- 5 -(4 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) phenyl) - 4 - 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazoline}platinum(II), trans-[PtCl 2 (p-Me 0 C 2 H 40 -C 6 H 4 CN) {N=C(p-Me 0 C 2 H 40 -C 6 H 4) - 0 -N(Me) -CH(Ph) }] (product 41), proved to be more effective in carboplatin resistant cell lines than platinum sensitive ones. This suggests a binding mode different to the accepted one exhibited by cisplatin, which is to the N 7 nitrogen of guanine. The synthetic strategy employed was the [2 + 3] cycloaddition of platinum nitrile complexes to nitrones. This method was chosen as it is a straight forward route to the platinum heterocycles, using relatively mild conditions. Also, properties such as solubility of the platinum oxadiazoline in polar solvents can easily be modified by using starting nitrones and platinum nitriles that contain polar substituents. The stalling reagents for these compounds are commercially available, simplifying the overall synthesis. In this way the ligand is constructed in the coordination sphere and subtle changes are effected without altering the basic skeleton of the complex. Nitrones of the type RC 6 H 4 CH=NOCH 3 (R= OH, CO 2 H, 2 -CH 3 OC 2 H 4 O, N(Me) 2, N+(Me) 3, and <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphonate</b> salt), were prepared from the corresponding aldehydes via the condensation of an aldehyde with N-methyl-hydroxylamine method.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the latex surface chemistry on the association of latices with different cellulose derivatives has been investigated by means of isothermal calorimetry and electrophoresis. The chemistries of three grades of coating latices differed {{with regard to the}} type and amount of vinylic monomer and the level of carboxylation. In addition, a styrene/butadiene latex substantially free from surfactant was used to establish the {{influence of}} physically pre-adsorbed surfactants on the association with the cellulose derivatives sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) and ethyl(hydroxyethyl) cellulose (EHEC). The results show that the latex chemistry, in terms of hydrophilic character originating from carboxylic acid groups, significantly affects the adsorption of the non-ionic HEC and EHEC. A higher degree of carboxylation or a more polar latex, such as vinyl acetate/acrylate, reduces the association with non-ionic cellulose derivatives. The addition of anionic <b>sodium</b> dodecylbenzene <b>sulphonate</b> or non-ionic fatty alcohol ethoxylate surfactants to the surfactant-free styrene/butadiene latex emulsion did not significantly change the association behaviour with EHEC, although it was evident that, for example, a <b>sodium</b> dodecyl <b>sulphonate</b> type of surfactant participated significantly in the adsorption process. Even if the surface polarity of the latex governs the association characteristics at the interface, the solubility properties of the cellulose derivatives Must be considered, meaning that the hydrophobic character {{plays an important role in}} the associative interaction between the latex and cellulose derivatives in aqueous media.

40|$|Polyelektrolyte sind Makromoleküle mit einer großen Zahl ionisierbarer Gruppen. In polaren Lösungsmitteln (z. B. Wasser) dissoziieren sie in hoch geladene Polyionen und niedermolekulare Gegenionen. Polymer- und Elektrolytcharakteristika vereinen sich in dieser Stoffklasse und sorgen für ein Verhalten, das sich stark von dem ungeladener Polymere unterscheidet. In verdünnten Polyelektrolytlösungen findet man (im Vergleich zu niedermolekularen Salzen) für die Gegenionen einen deutlich verringerten Aktivitätskoeffizienten. Die Ursache dafür sind elektrostatische Wechselwirkungen zwischen Gegenionen und Polyion. Bei Polyelektrolyten mit hoher Ladungsdichte können einige der Gegenionen an das Polyion 'kondensiert' oder gebunden sein, während andere sich frei in der Ionenatmosphäre des Polyelektrolyten bewegen. Man spricht hierbei von Gegenionenkondensation. In dieser Arbeit wurde am Beispiel des Na-Polystyrolsulfonats (NaPSS) eine Methode entwickelt, die es ermöglicht, osmotische Koeffizienten über das Sedimentationsgleichgewicht zu ermitteln. Dabei wird eine Polyelektrolytlösung mit einer geringen Menge eines niedermolekularen Salzes (Na-Nitroanilinsulfonat) zentrifugiert, bis das Sedimentationsgleichgewicht erreicht ist. Die Konzentrationsgradienten beider Komponenten werden mittels UV-Absorptionsoptik bestimmt. Die dem Donnan-Gleichgewicht analoge Kopplung der beiden Konzentrationsgradienten ermöglicht die Berechnung des osmotischen Koeffizienten für das NaPSS. Bei den Untersuchungen wurden die Konzentrationen des Na-Nitroanilinsulfonats, des NaPSS und die Molmasse des NaPSS variiert. In weiteren Experimenten wurde das Sedimentationsgleichgewicht von salzfreien NaPSS-Lösungen sowie die Veränderung des Sedimentationsgleichgewichts durch sukzessive NaCl-Zugabe (und der damit einhergehenden Unterdrückung des Polyelektrolyteffekts) untersucht. Polyelectrolytes are macromolecules with a {{large number}} of ionic groups. In polar sovents (e. g. water) they dissociate into highly charged polyions and an {{equivalent}} number of small counterions. They combine the characteristics of polymers and electrolytes and produce a behaviour which differs strongly from that of uncharged polymers. In diluted solutions of polyelectrolytes (compared to that of low molecular salts) a significantly small activity coefficient is found for the polyelectrolytes. This is caused by electrostatic interaction between polyions and counterions. In solutions of high-charged polyelectrolytes some of the counterions are found to be 'condensed' or bound to the polyion. Others can move freely within the ionc atmosphere of the polyelectrolyte. This effect is called counterion condensation. In this work a method (using <b>sodium</b> polystyrene <b>sulphonate</b> as polyelektrolyte) which makes it possible to determine osmotic coefficients via sedimentation equilibrium measurements is introduced: A solution of the polyelectrolyte containing a small amount of an ionic dye (<b>sodium</b> nitroaniline <b>sulphonate)</b> as simple salt is centrifuged until the sedimentation equilibrium is reached. The concentration gradients of both components are determined using an UV-Vis absorption optics. The coupling of the two gradients via a Donnan-type equilibrium allows the calculation of the osmotic coefficient of the polyelectrolyte. Using this method the dependence of the osmotic coefficient of <b>sodium</b> polystyrene <b>sulphonate</b> (NaPSS) on its molar mass, its concentration and on the concentration of the simple salt is examined. In additional experiments the sedimentation equilibrium of very diluted salt free NaPSS solutions and the dependence of the sedimentation equilibrium on the concentration of the low molecular salt is examined...|$|R

The gradient method uses mobile phases containing acetonitrile (ACN), 20 mM <b>sodium</b> octane <b>sulphonate</b> (SOS), 0. 2 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer pH 2. 8, water: A: (4 : 70 : 10 : 16 v/v/v/v) and 13 : (17 : 70 : 10 : 3 v/v/v/v). The method proved to be robust, linear, repeatable, sensitive, selective and easy to perform. For the related substances test 50 mu l of a 0. 5 mg/ml D-cycloserine solution is injected. For assay, a concentration of 0. 1 mg/ml is proposed to avoid overloading of the detector. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
