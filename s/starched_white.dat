This contrast of technique may have been intended to emphasize the solidly sculptural presence of the head. Furthering this impression is the delicate coloring of Kenton's face, seen against the hard edge of his <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> collar.|$|E
500|$|Bertin is {{presented}} as strong, energetic and warm-hearted. His hair is grey verging on white, his fingers spread across his knees. Bertin's fingers were described in 1959 by artist Henry de Waroquier as [...] "crab-like claws... emerging from the tenebrous caverns that are {{the sleeves of his}} coat." [...] The bulk of his body is compacted in a tight black jacket, black trousers and brown satin waistcoat, with a <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> shirt and cravat revealing his open neck. He wears a gold watch and a pair of glasses in his right pocket. In the view of art historian Robert Rosenblum, his [...] "nearly ferocious presence" [...] is accentuated by the tightly constrained space. The chair and clothes appear too small to contain him. His coiled, stubby fingers rest on his thighs, barely protruding from the sleeves of his jacket, while his neck cannot be seen above his narrow <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> collar.|$|E
500|$|Gluck, an English artist whom Brooks painted around 1923, {{was noted}} in the {{contemporary}} press as much for her style of dress as for her art. She pushed the masculine style further than most by wearing trousers on all occasions, which was not considered acceptable in the 1920s. Articles about her presented her cross-dressing as an artistic eccentricity or {{as a sign that}} she was ultra-modern. [...] Brooks' portrait shows Gluck in a <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> shirt, a silk tie, and a long black belted coat that she designed and had made by a [...] "mad dressmaker"; her right hand, at her waist, holds a man's hat. Brooks painted these masculine accoutrements with the same attention she had once given to the parasols and ostrich plumes of La Belle Époque. But while many of Brooks' early paintings show sad and withdrawn figures [...] "consumed by petticoats, veiled hats and other period trappings of femininity", Gluck is self-possessed and quietly intensean artist who insists on being taken seriously. [...] Her appearance is so androgynous that {{it would be difficult to}} identify her as a woman without help from the title, and the title itselfPeter, a Young English Girlunderscores the gender ambiguity of the image.|$|E

I saw a high <b>starched</b> collar, <b>white</b> cuffs, a light alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clean necktie, and varnished boots. No hat. Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a big white hand. He was amazing, and had a penholder behind his ear.|$|R
60|$|Health {{and life}} were very {{vigorous}} in Eustacie; and though {{at first she}} had been completely worn out, {{a few days of}} comfort, entire rest, and good nursing restored her. Noemi dressed her much like herself, in a black gown, prim little <b>white</b> <b>starched</b> ruff, and <b>white</b> cap,--a thorough Calvinist dress, and befitting a minister's widow. Eustacie winced a little at hearing of the character that had been fastened upon her; she disliked for her child, still more than for herself, to take this bourgeois name of Gardon; but there was no help for it, since, though he chief personages of the town were Huguenot, there could be no safety for her if the report were once allowed to arise that the Baronne de Ribaumont had taken refuge there.|$|R
50|$|A cornette is a {{piece of}} female {{headwear}} that was especially popular in Europe in the 15th to 17th century. It is essentially a type of wimple consisting of a large <b>starched</b> piece of <b>white</b> cloth that is folded upwards {{in such a way as}} to create the resemblance of horns (cornes) on the wearer's head.|$|R

[...] When the juniors are finished, Reveille, the Texas A mascot, is escorted onto the field.|$|E
2500|$|In 1903, Remington painted His First Lesson set on an American-owned {{ranch in}} Chihuahua, Mexico. The hands wear heavy chaps, <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> shirts, and slouch-brimmed hats. In his paintings, Remington sought {{to let his}} {{audience}} [...] "take away {{something to think about}} – to imagine." [...] In 1905, Remington had a major publicity coup when Collier's devoted an entire issue to the artist, showcasing his latest works. It was that same year {{that the president of the}} Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art) commissioned Remington to create a large sculpture of a cowboy for Philadelphia's Fairmount Park, which was erected in 1908 on a jutting rock along Kelly Drive – a site Remington specifically chose for the piece after having a horseman pose for him in that exact location. Philadelphia's Cowboy (1908) was Remington's first and only large-scale bronze, and the sculpture is one of the earliest examples of site-specific art in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|While {{he was in}} college, from 1975 to 1978, {{he handled}} [...] "labor and budget matters" [...] as an {{assistant}} to the city manager of Edmond, Oklahoma (1980 population of 34,637). His White House biography stated that he had emergency services oversight in this position. However, the head of public relations for the city was quoted as denying that Brown had oversight over anybody and that [...] "the assistant is more like an intern." [...] She said, [...] "Mike used to handle a lot of details. Every now and again I'd ask him to write me a speech. He was very loyal. He was always on time. He always had on a suit and a <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> shirt." [...] However, Claudia Deakins, the spokesperson for the City of Edmond, submitted information to the House Committee investigating Hurricane Katrina that Time Magazine, which described his resume as [...] "padded," [...] had taken her quotes out of context, and erroneously reported Brown's position at the City of Edmond. The former Mayor of Edmond, Carl Reherman, and the former City Attorney, Mary Ann Karns, each submitted affidavits to the House investigating committee showing that Brown did have emergency management experience.|$|E

60|$|They forced {{their eyes}} to {{penetrate}} the dense gloom which surrounded them, and one and all held their breath, like furtive animals that await their prey.

5000|$|From {{the end of}} the 16th century, {{the term}} band applied to any long-strip neckcloth that was not a ruff. The ruff, a <b>starched,</b> pleated <b>white</b> linen strip, {{originated}} earlier in the 16th century as a neckcloth (readily changeable, to minimize the soiling of a doublet), as a bib, or as a napkin. A band could be either a plain, attached shirt collar or a detachable [...] "falling band" [...] that draped over the doublet collar. It is possible that cravats were initially worn to hide shirts which were not immaculately clean. [...] Alternatively, it was thought to serve as psychological protection of the neck during battle from attack by a spear.|$|R

Even while speaking he had vanished within the house, returned quickly--having replaced his dark suit by jean trousers tucked in heavy boots, and a red flannel shirt over his <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> one--and, nodding gayly to Mainwaring, stepped from {{the lower end of}} the veranda. [...] "The beggar actually looks pleased to go," [...] said Mainwaring to himself in wonderment.|$|E
60|$|Tuesday {{afternoon}} the Aid Society met at Green Gables. Anne hurried home from school, for {{she knew that}} Marilla would need all the assistance she could give. Dora, neat and proper, in her nicely <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> dress and black sash, was sitting {{with the members of}} the Aid in the parlor, speaking demurely when spoken to, keeping silence when not, and in every way comporting herself as a model child.

60|$|The {{flood of}} {{memories}} brought back by this revival of an incident anterior to her troubles produced a momentary dismay lest, recognizing her also, he should by some means discover her story. But it passed away {{when she found}} no sign of remembrance in him. She saw by degrees that since their first and only encounter his mobile face had grown more thoughtful, and had acquired a young man's shapely moustache and beard--the latter of the palest straw colour where it began upon his cheeks, and deepening to a warm brown farther from its root. Under his linen milking-pinner he wore a dark velveteen jacket, cord breeches and gaiters, and a <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> shirt. Without the milking-gear nobody could have guessed what he was. He might with equal probability have been an eccentric landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman. That he was but a novice at dairy work she had realized in a moment, {{from the time he}} had spent upon the milking of one cow.|$|E

5000|$|White tie, {{also called}} full evening dress or a dress suit, {{is the most}} formal evening dress code in Western high fashion. For men, it {{consists}} of a black tailcoat worn over a <b>white</b> <b>starched</b> shirt, marcella waistcoat and the eponymous white bow tie worn around a detachable collar. High-waisted black trousers and patent leather shoes complete the outfit, although decorations can be worn and a top hat and white scarf are acceptable as accessories.

60|$|Beside him Pythagoras {{looked like}} the full stop in a semi-colon, for he was but little over five feet in height and very fat. His doublet of thick green cloth had long ago burst its buttons across his protuberent chest. His face, which was round as a full moon, was highly {{coloured}} even {{to the tip of}} his small upturned nose, and his forehead, crowned by a thick mass of red-brown hair which fell in heavy and lanky waves down to his eyebrows, was always wet and shiny. He had a habit of standing with legs wide apart, his abdomen thrust forward and his small podgy hands resting upon it. His eyes were very small and blinked incessantly. Below his double chin he wore a huge bow of <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> linen, which at this moment was sadly crumpled and stained, and his collar which also had seen more prosperous days was held together by a piece of string.|$|E
60|$|Burrin pier on {{the south}} shore of Galway Bay in Ireland, a region of stone-capped hills and granite fields. It is a fine summer day in the year 3000 A.D. On an ancient stone stump, about three feet thick and three feet high, used for {{securing}} ships by ropes to the shore, and called a bollard or holdfast, an elderly gentleman sits facing the land with his head bowed and {{his face in his}} hands, sobbing. His sunburnt skin contrasts with his white whiskers and eyebrows. He wears a black frock-coat, a white waistcoat, lavender trousers, a brilliant silk cravat with a jewelled pin stuck in it, a tall hat of grey felt, and patent leather boots with white spats. His starched linen cuffs protrude from his coat sleeves; and his collar, also of <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> linen, is Gladstonian. On his right, three or four full sacks, lying {{side by side on the}} flags, suggest that the pier, unlike many remote Irish piers, is occasionally useful as well as romantic. On his left, behind him, a flight of stone steps descends out of sight to the sea level.|$|E
60|$|Tozer, who was {{constantly}} galled and tormented by a <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> cambric neckerchief, which he wore at the express desire of Mrs Tozer, his parent, who, designing {{him for the}} Church, was of opinion that he couldn't be in that forward state of preparation too soon--Tozer said, indeed, that choosing between two evils, {{he thought he would}} rather stay where he was, than go home. However inconsistent this declaration might appear with that passage in Tozer's Essay on the subject, wherein he had observed 'that the thoughts of home and all its recollections, awakened in his mind the most pleasing emotions of anticipation and delight,' and had also likened himself to a Roman General, flushed with a recent victory over the Iceni, or laden with Carthaginian spoil, advancing within a few hours' march of the Capitol, presupposed, {{for the purposes of the}} simile, to be the dwelling-place of Mrs Tozer, still it was very sincerely made. For it seemed that Tozer had a dreadful Uncle, who not only volunteered examinations of him, in the holidays, on abstruse points, but twisted innocent events and things, and wrenched them to the same fell purpose. So that if this Uncle took him to the Play, or, on a similar pretence of kindness, carried him to see a Giant, or a Dwarf, or a Conjuror, or anything, Tozer knew he had read up some classical allusion to the subject beforehand, and was thrown into a state of mortal apprehension: not foreseeing where he might break out, or what authority he might not quote against him.|$|E
60|$|Percival Ford {{wondered}} why he had come. He did not dance. He did not care much for army people. Yet he knew them all--gliding and revolving there on the broad lanai of the Seaside, the officers in their fresh- <b>starched</b> uniforms of <b>white,</b> the civilians in white and black, and the women bare of shoulders and arms. After two years in Honolulu the Twentieth was departing to its new station in Alaska, and Percival Ford, {{as one of the}} big men of the Islands, could not help knowing the officers and their women.|$|R
50|$|In the beginning, Ambrose was {{presented}} as a typical working class member: rough and rather simple and uneducated. Prone to alcoholism and other scourges, {{he also had a}} somewhat tragic side. This largely came to an end when Vandersteen started to work for Hergé, who didn't like the folksy component. In particular in the period of The Blue Series, Ambrose suddenly becomes sophisticated, bright and brave, even aristocratic (for example he teaches fencing) and is arguably truly the main character of the story in those albums. Later, the personage gets its definitive outfit (black trousers, <b>white</b> <b>starched</b> shirt and a black bow tie) and settles as a middle class part-time father figure for Spike and Suzy, who lives together with Jethro.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was never}} an {{interval}} when something was not at hand to be done. Joe waited for nothing, waited on nothing, and went on the jump from task to task. They <b>starched</b> two hundred <b>white</b> shirts, with a single gathering movement seizing a shirt so that the wristbands, neckband, yoke, and bosom protruded beyond the circling right hand. At the same moment the left hand held up {{the body of the}} shirt so that it would not enter the starch, and at the moment the right hand dipped into the starch--starch so hot that, in order to wring it out, their hands had to thrust, and thrust continually, into a bucket of cold water. And that night they worked till half-past ten, dipping [...] "fancy starch"--all the frilled and airy, delicate wear of ladies.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{began to}} feel {{slightly}} uneasy. You know I am not used to such ceremonies, {{and there was something}} ominous in the atmosphere. It was just as though I had been let into some conspiracy--I don't know--something not quite right; and I was glad to get out. In the outer room the two women knitted black wool feverishly. People were arriving, and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them. The old one sat on her chair. Her flat cloth slippers were propped up on a foot-warmer, and a cat reposed on her lap. She wore a <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> affair on her head, had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed spectacles hung on the tip of her nose. She glanced at me above the glasses. The swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me. Two youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over, and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom. She seemed to know all about them and about me too. An eerie feeling came over me. She seemed uncanny and fateful. Often far away there I thought of these two, guarding the door of Darkness, knitting black wool as for a warm pall, one introducing, introducing continuously to the unknown, the other scrutinizing the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old eyes. Ave! Old knitter of black wool. Morituri te salutant. Not many of those she looked at ever saw her again--not half, by a long way.|$|E
6000|$|So far, however, {{their attack}} on society has lacked simplicity. The poor {{do not share}} their tastes nor {{understand}} their art-criticisms. They {{do not want the}} simple life, nor the esthetic life; on the contrary, they want very much to wallow in all the costly vulgarities from which the elect souls among the rich turn away with loathing. It is by surfeit and not by abstinence that they will be cured of their hankering after unwholesome sweets. What they do dislike and despise and are ashamed of is poverty. To ask them to fight for the difference between the Christmas number of the Illustrated London News and the Kelmscott Chaucer is silly: they prefer the News. The difference between a stockbroker's cheap and dirty <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> shirt and collar and the comparatively costly and carefully dyed blue shirt of William Morris is a difference so disgraceful to Morris in their eyes that if they fought on the subject at all, they would fight in defence of the starch. [...] "Cease to be slaves, in order that you may become cranks" [...] is not a very inspiring call to arms; nor is it really improved by substituting saints for cranks. Both terms denote men of genius; and the common man does not want to live the life of a man of genius: he would much rather live the life of a pet collie if that were the only alternative. But he does want more money. Whatever else he may be vague about, he is clear about that. He may or may not prefer Major Barbara to the Drury Lane pantomime; but he always prefers five hundred pounds to five hundred shillings.|$|E
60|$|Never shall I {{forget the}} dignity and sense of {{importance}} which swelled my mind when I was first pronounced old {{enough to go to}} meeting. That eventful Sunday I was up long before day, and even took my Sabbath suit to the window to ascertain by the first light that it actually was there, just as it looked the night before. With what complacency did I view myself completely dressed! How did I count over the rows of yellow gilt buttons on my coat! how my good mother, grandmother, and aunts fussed, and twitched, and pulled, to make every thing set up and set down, just in the proper place! how my clean, <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> collar was turned over and smoothed again and again, and my golden curls twisted and arranged {{to make the most of}} me! and, last of all, how I was cautioned not to be thinking of my clothes! In truth, I was in those days a very handsome youngster, and it really is no more than justice to let the fact be known, as there is nothing in my present appearance from which it could ever be inferred. Every body in the house successively asked me if I should be a good boy, and sit still, and not talk, nor laugh; and my mother informed me, in terrorem, that there was a tithing man, who carried off naughty children, and shut them up in a dark place behind the pulpit; and that this tithing man, Mr. Zephaniah Scranton, sat just where he could see me. This fact impressed my mind with more solemnity than all the exhortations which had preceded it--a proof of the efficacy of facts above reason. Under shadow and power of this weighty truth, I demurely took hold of my mother's forefinger to walk to meeting.|$|E
60|$|For want of more exalted adversaries Dominic {{turned his}} audacity fertile in impious stratagems against {{the powers of}} the earth, as {{represented}} by the institution of Custom-houses and every mortal belonging thereto--scribes, officers, and guardacostas afloat and ashore. He was the very man for us, this modern and unlawful wanderer with his own legend of loves, dangers, and bloodshed. He told us bits of it sometimes in measured, ironic tones. He spoke Catalonian, the Italian of Corsica and the French of Provence with the same easy naturalness. Dressed in shore-togs, a <b>white</b> <b>starched</b> shirt, black jacket, and round hat, as I took him once to see Dona Rita, he was extremely presentable. He could make himself interesting by a tactful and rugged reserve set off by a grim, almost imperceptible, playfulness of tone and manner.|$|R

60|$|He was a prim-faced, red-nosed man, with a long, thin countenance, and a semi-rattlesnake sort of eye--rather sharp, but decidedly bad. He wore {{very short}} trousers, and black cotton stockings, which, {{like the rest}} of his apparel, were {{particularly}} rusty. His looks were <b>starched,</b> but his <b>white</b> neckerchief was not, and its long limp ends straggled over his closely-buttoned waistcoat in a very uncouth and unpicturesque fashion. A pair of old, worn, beaver gloves, a broad-brimmed hat, and a faded green umbrella, with plenty of whalebone sticking through the bottom, as if to counterbalance the want of a handle at the top, lay on a chair beside him; and, being disposed in a very tidy and careful manner, seemed to imply that the red-nosed man, whoever he was, had no intention of going away in a hurry.|$|R
6000|$|And then {{a certain}} other phase of my private life crept into {{official}} view, and did me a damage. As I shall explain just now, I rarely {{at this time}} had any money wherewith to pay my bills. In this state of things a certain tailor had taken from me an acceptance for, I think, 12, which {{found its way into}} the hands of a money-lender. With that man, who lived in a little street near Mecklenburgh Square, I formed a most heart-rending but a most intimate acquaintance. In cash I once received from him 4. For that and for the original amount of the tailor's bill, which grew monstrously under repeated renewals, I paid ultimately something over 200. That is so common a story as to be hardly worth the telling; but the peculiarity of this man was that he became so attached to me as to visit me every day at my office. For a long period he found it to be worth his while to walk up those stone steps daily, and come and stand behind my chair, whispering to me always the same words: [...] "Now I wish you would be punctual. If you only would be punctual, I should like you to have anything you want." [...] He was a little, clean, old man, who always wore a high <b>starched</b> <b>white</b> cravat inside of which he had a habit of twisting his chin as he uttered his caution. When I remember the constant persistency of his visits, I cannot but feel that he was paid very badly for his time and trouble. Those visits were very terrible, and can have hardly been of service to me in the office.|$|E

Her long ruddy curls were sleek and round, and Susan had let her put on her best hat, out of compliment to the manse. It was a somewhat elaborate affair, wherein Susan's taste had had more to say than Anne's, and Rilla's small soul gloried in its splendours of silk and lace and flowers. She was very conscious of her hat, and I am afraid she strutted up the manse hill. The strut, or the hat, or both, got on the nerves of Mary Vance, who was swinging on the lawn gate. Mary's temper was somewhat ruffled just then, into the bargain. Aunt Martha had refused to let her peel the potatoes and had ordered {{her out of the}} kitchen.|$|R
