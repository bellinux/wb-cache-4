25|$|Granada drew on 1970s {{pop music}} with {{shows such as}} Lift Off with Ayshea and the Bay City Rollers show, Shang-a-lang. Granada's <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes</b> was {{presented}} by Tony Wilson and showcased the punk phenomenon, bringing the Sex Pistols and the Clash to TV screens. The station also produced Marc, presented by glam rock star Marc Bolan. The show was in production when Bolan {{was killed in a}} car accident in 1977. Granada produced Allsorts from 1989 to 1995 for CITV, featuring Wayne Jackman, Andrew Wightman (who later produced Granada's talent show Stars in Their Eyes), Virginia Radcliffe, Jane Cox and Julie Westwood.|$|E
25|$|Keaton is a 1964 {{graduate}} of Santa Ana High School in Santa Ana, California. During her time there, she participated in singing and acting clubs at school, and starred as Blanche DuBois {{in a school}} production of A Streetcar Named Desire. After graduation, she attended Santa Ana College, and later Orange Coast College as an acting student, but dropped out after a year to pursue an entertainment career in Manhattan. Upon joining the Actors' Equity Association, she changed her surname to Keaton, her mother's maiden name, as there was already an actress registered {{under the name of}} Diane Hall. For a brief time, she also moonlighted at nightclubs with a singing act. She would later revisit her nightclub act in Annie Hall (1977) and And <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes</b> (2014), and a cameo in Radio Days (1987).|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Fight the Fight" [...] {{from the}} show was {{recorded}} and released by Michael Ball {{as part of his}} Both Sides Now album in February 2013. The same track was later released as a digital download in December 2013, sung by Robert Lonsdale. In July 2013, Rice allowed Clare Teal to record another song {{from the show}}, [...] "Another Language", for release on her album And <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes.</b> In February 2014, Rice announced that a cast album would be recorded, prior to the show's West End closure. The original London cast recording was released as a digital download on 3 July 2014, with the physical release following on 4 August.|$|E
500|$|According to Jon Savage, [...] "there seems {{little doubt}} that Lydon was fed {{material}} by Vivienne Westwood and Jamie Reid, which he then converted into his own lyric." [...] "Anarchy in the U.K." [...] was among the seven originals recorded in another demo session that month, this one overseen by the band's sound engineer, Dave Goodman. McLaren organised a major event for 29 August at the Screen on the Green in London's Islington district: the Buzzcocks and the Clash opened for the Sex Pistols in punk's [...] "first metropolitan test of strength". Three days later, the band were in Manchester to tape what would be their first television appearance, for Tony Wilson's <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes.</b> Scheduled to perform just one song, [...] "Anarchy in the U.K.", the band ran straight through another two numbers as pandemonium {{broke out in the}} control room.|$|E
500|$|Kurt Vonnegut has {{inspired}} numerous posthumous tributes and works. In 2008, the Kurt Vonnegut Society was established, and in November 2010, the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library was opened in Vonnegut's hometown of Indianapolis. The Library of America published {{a compendium of}} Vonnegut's compositions between 1963 and 1973 the following April, and another compendium of his earlier works in 2012. Late 2011 saw the release of two Vonnegut biographies, Gregory Sumner's Unstuck in Time and Charles J. Shields's And <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes.</b> Shields's biography of Vonnegut created some controversy. According to The Guardian, the book portrays Vonnegut as distant, cruel and nasty. [...] "Cruel, nasty and scary are the adjectives commonly used to describe him by the friends, colleagues, and relatives Shields quotes", said The Daily Beasts Wendy Smith. [...] "Towards the end he was very feeble, very depressed and almost morose", said Jerome Klinkowitz of the University of Northern Iowa, who has examined Vonnegut in depth.|$|E

500|$|The Sex Pistols {{played their}} first concert outside Britain on 3 September, {{at the opening}} of the Chalet du Lac disco in Paris. The Bromley Contingent {{accompanied}} them, with Siouxsie Sioux's swastika armband causing a stir. The following day, the <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes</b> performance aired; the audience heard [...] "Anarchy in the U.K." [...] introduced with a shout of [...] "Get off your arse!" [...] On 13 September, the Pistols began a tour of Britain. A week later, back in London, they headlined the opening night of the 100 Club Punk Special. Organised by McLaren (for whom the word [...] "festival" [...] had too much of a hippie connotation), the event was [...] "considered the moment that was the catalyst for the years to come." [...] Belying the common perception that punk bands couldn't play their instruments, contemporary music press reviews, later critical assessments of concert recordings, and testimonials by fellow musicians indicate that the Pistols had developed into a tight, ferocious live band. As Rotten tested out wild vocalisation styles, the instrumentalists experimented [...] "with overload, feedback and distortion...pushing their equipment to the limit".|$|E
500|$|In September 1978, Joy Division {{made their}} {{television}} debut performing [...] "Shadowplay" [...] on <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes,</b> with an introduction by Wilson {{in which he}} misidentified Sumner, and not Hook, as being from Salford. In October, Joy Division contributed two tracks recorded with producer Martin Hannett to the compilation double-7" [...] EP A Factory Sample, the first release by Tony Wilson's record label, Factory Records. In the NME review of the EP, Paul Morley hailed the band as [...] "the missing link between Elvis Presley and [...] the Banshees". Joy Division joined Factory's roster, after buying themselves {{out of the deal}} with RCA. Rob Gretton was made a partner of the label so as to represent the interests of the band. On 27 December, Ian Curtis had his first recognisable epileptic episode. During the ride home after a show at the Hope and Anchor pub in London, Curtis experienced an epileptic seizure and was taken to a hospital. In spite of his illness, Joy Division's career progressed. He appeared on the cover of 13 January 1979 issue of the NME following the persistence of music journalist Paul Morley. That month the band recorded their first session for BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. According to Deborah Curtis, [...] "Sandwiched in between these two important landmarks was the realization that Ian's illness was something we would have to learn to accommodate".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and how she {{did not believe that}} the video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t even believe. In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, Keaton {{starred in}} And <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes</b> and 5 Flights Up. In Rob Reiner's romantic dramedy And <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes,</b> Keaton portrayed a widowed lounge singer, who finds autumnal {{love with a}} bad boy, played by Michael Douglas. The film {{received}} largely negative reviews from critics, who felt that [...] "And <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes</b> aims for comedy, but with two talented actors stuck in a half-hearted effort from a once-mighty filmmaker, it ends in unintentional tragedy." [...] Keaton co-starred with Morgan Freeman in Richard Loncraine's comedy film 5 Flights Up. Based on the novel Heroic Measures by Jill Ciment, they play a long-married couple who have an eventful weekend after {{they are forced to}} contemplate selling their beloved Brooklyn apartment. Shot in New York, the film premiered, under its former name Ruth & Alex, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. The same year, Keaton became the first woman to receive the Golden Lion Award from the Zurich Film Festival.|$|E
2500|$|The {{investigators}} note {{parallels between}} the two stories. They soon conclude that the hyena symbolizes the cook, the zebra the sailor, the orangutan Pi's mother, and the tiger represents Pi. Pi points out that neither story can be proven and neither explains {{the cause of the}} shipwreck, so he asks the officials which story they prefer: the one without animals or the one with animals. They eventually choose the story with the animals. Pi thanks them and says: [...] "And <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> with God." [...] The investigators then leave and file a report.|$|E
2500|$|James {{developed}} his television {{career as a}} guest commentator on various shows, including as an occasional co-presenter with Tony Wilson on the first series of <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes,</b> the Granada Television pop music show. On the show when the Sex Pistols made their TV debut, James commented: [...] "During the recording, the task of keeping the little bastards under control was given to me. With {{the aid of a}} radio microphone, I was able to shout them down, but it was a near thing...they attacked everything around them and had difficulty in being polite even to each other".|$|E

2500|$|While {{the band}} {{intended}} {{to split up}} after the gig, {{they were asked to}} play again. Two months later, Siouxsie and Severin recruited drummer Kenny Morris and guitarist Peter Fenton. After playing several gigs in early 1977, they realised that Fenton did not fit in because he was [...] "a real rock guitarist". John McKay finally took his place in July. Their first live appearance on television took place in November on Manchester's [...] Granada, on Tony Wilson's tv show <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes.</b> They then recorded their first John Peel session for BBC radio and appeared on the front cover of UK weekly Sounds magazine the following month.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with China Central Television (CCTV) on 12 June 2005, Lee stressed {{the need to have}} a continuous renewal of talent in the country's leadership, saying:"In a different world we need to find a niche for ourselves, little corners where in spite of our small size we can perform a role which will be useful to the world. To do that, you will need people at the top, decision-makers who have got foresight, good minds, who are open to ideas, who can seize opportunities like we did... My job really was to find my successors. I found them, they are there; their job is to find their successors. So there must be this continuous renewal of talented, dedicated, honest, able people who will do things not for themselves but for their people and for their country. If they can do that, they will carry on for another one generation and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on. The moment that breaks, it's gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Sweet Child o' Mine" [...] was the album's second U.S. single, a {{love song}} co-written by Rose as a poem for his then-girlfriend Erin Everly, {{daughter}} of Don Everly of the Everly Brothers. Due to the growing grassroots success of the band and the cross-gender appeal of the song, [...] "Sweet Child o' Mine" [...] and its accompanying music video received heavy airplay on both radio and MTV, becoming a huge hit {{during the summer of}} 1988 and reaching {{the top of the charts}} in the U.S. Slash later commented, [...] "I hated that song with a huge passion for the longest time, and it turned out to be our hugest hit, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> to show what I know." [...] The song was released in Japan as part of the EP Live from the Jungle, which also featured a selection of live recordings from the band's June 1987 dates at London's The Marquee, the group's first shows outside the United States. The song is the highest charting Guns N' Roses song, and is the band's only song to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main frame}} story {{concerns}} Shahryār [...] ( [...] , from Middle Persian šahr-dār, lit. [...] "holder of realm"), whom the narrator calls a [...] "Sasanian king" [...] ruling in [...] "India and China". He is {{shocked to learn}} that his brother's wife is unfaithful; discovering that his own wife's infidelity has been even more flagrant, he has her killed. In his bitterness and grief, he decides that all women are the same. Shahryār begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she {{has a chance to}} dishonour him. Eventually the vizier, whose duty it is to provide them, cannot find any more virgins. Scheherazade ( [...] , from Middle Persian čehr/lineage + āzād/noble), the vizier's daughter, offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins (and only begins) a new one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of this tale, postpones her execution once again. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on for 1,001 nights.|$|E

60|$|William IV. died in {{the year}} 1837. He was the last English king who had the German State of Hanover. It cannot belong to a woman, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> to his brother Ernest, instead of his niece Victoria.|$|R
