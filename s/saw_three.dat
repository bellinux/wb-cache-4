5|$|In 1973, {{the country}} {{held its first}} {{parliamentary}} elections; however, two years later, the late emir dissolved the parliament and suspended the constitution after parliament rejected the State Security Law. The period between 2002 and 2010 <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> parliamentary elections. The first, held in 2002 was boycotted by the opposition, Al Wefaq, which won {{a majority in the}} second in 2006 and third in 2010. The 2011 by-election was held to replace 18 members of Al Wefaq who resigned in protest against government crackdown.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphians <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> ballot {{questions}} in the primary election, all of which involved allowing the city to borrow money. The loans, on the ballot at Clark's urging, were designed to allow the city to temporarily increase spending without raising taxes, and were opposed by many ward leaders in both parties. As a result, they went down to unexpected defeat by a 3:2 margin. Undeterred, Clark and his allies revised and relisted the loans for {{a vote in the}} general election in November, which would see better turnout and, they believed, a better chance of success.|$|E

Theory of Literature <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> editions and has been translated into more than twenty languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{first round}} of the 2012 Fed Cup <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> wins in the single competition, two of which were made by Kuznetsova, the first against Silvia Soler Espinosa, the second against Carla Suárez Navarro. The pair Kuznetsova/Petrova retired in their last match due to Kuznetsova's fatigue, but Russia still won in 3–2. Team Russia lost against the Serbian team in the semifinal, 2–3.

Lindwall played in two Tests against either nation with only moderate results: he took nine wickets at 38.22 and scored 38 runs at 12.66. Lindwall finished with 228 Test wickets, eight wickets behind Alec Bedser's then world record of 236 wickets. In his last Test innings, Lindwall scored ten, which took his tally to 1502 runs, making him the first player to score 1500 runs and take 200 wickets in Test cricket.|$|E

5|$|In the {{vicinity}} of Gravesend, the right-hand German formation – comprising the Do 17s of KG 3, trailed by the He 111s of KG 26 – would {{bear the brunt of}} the next attack from 63 fighters from 17, 46, 249, 257, 504 and 603 Squadrons. The Hurricanes of 249 and 504 squadrons went into action first. Their first pass <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> Do 17s go down, including Hauptmann Ernst Püttmann, leading 5. Staffel of KG 3 (5./KG 3). The Bf 109s escorting KG 26 could only watch, forbidden to leave their Heinkel charges. As the first attack finished, No. 257 Squadron led by Squadron Leader Robert Stanford Tuck attacked the Heinkels with nine Hurricanes. The escorts had their work cut out and were scattered. No. 257 targeted the badly protected bombers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, all of Al-Talaba's matches in the 2003–04 season were postponed and then cancelled, except two games which they won against Al-Sinaa before the league was abandoned for the season. Al-Talaba were the runners-up of the 2003 Baghdad Championship (the new name of the Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, which is now known as Iraqi Elite Cup), defeating Al-Shorta 2–1 in the semi-finals and losing to Al-Zawra'a 5–4 on penalties after a 2–2 draw in the final, a match that <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> red cards in total. In the 2002–03 AFC Champions League, Al-Talaba finished third in Group D with three points from three games after one win and two losses.|$|E

5|$|The 2002 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was a slightly above average Pacific {{hurricane season}} that <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> tropical cyclones reach Category 5 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The strongest storm {{this year was}} Hurricane Kenna, which reached Category5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. It made landfall near Puerto Vallarta, located in the Mexican state of Jalisco, on October 25. The hurricane killed four people {{and was one of}} the most powerful hurricanes to ever strike the western coast of Mexico, hitting with winds of 140mph. Elsewhere, Tropical Storm Julio made landfall in Mexico, and Tropical Storm Boris dumped torrential rain along the Mexican coast, despite remaining offshore.|$|E
5|$|The July 1924 {{timetable}} showed eight {{passenger trains}} each way between Amlwch and Gaerwen, with the Red Wharf Bay railmotor operating to Llangefni {{three times a}} day. The extra Thursday service to Llangefni for the market was still included. By the summer of 1929, there were eight trains from Gaerwen to Amlwch, and seven in the other direction. One train to and from Amlwch no longer ran Thursdays, replaced with a second two return trip to Llangefni, operated by the railmotor. The loop at Llangwyllog now <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> pairs of passenger trains passing on weekdays, while the daily freight train would be shunted into sidings at Llangefni and Llanerchymedd to make way. Motor train services were back up to 24 single trips a day, including the Red Wharf Bay services.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} video games have been {{developed}} that tie to the Yu Yu Hakusho series, most {{of which have been}} produced for and released exclusively in Japan. Prior to the launch of the franchise in North America, games were released on the Game Boy, Super Famicom, Sega consoles, and various platforms. North America only <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> video game releases. Two releases for the Nintendo's Game Boy Advanced handheld console, and one release for Sony's PlayStation 2 console. A single Mega Drive game, Yū Yū Hakusho: Makyō Tōitsusen, was published in Brazil by Tectoy in 1999 under the title Yu Yu Hakusho: Sunset Fighters. When Atari gained publishing rights to Yu Yu Hakusho video games in 2003, the company created and released three games in these regions: , an action-adventure game for the Game Boy Advance; , a tactical role-playing game also for the Game Boy Advance; and , a 3D fighting game for the PlayStation 2.|$|E

5|$|Benfica faced Marítimo in an away {{game at the}} {{beginning}} of November. They lost 0–3, to a hat-trick from Lagorio. Without a single road game victory, the team dropped to tenth in the league's standings. They hosted Farense in the second week of November and won 2–1. Van Hooijdonk and João Tomás scored a goal each, within a 4-minute interval just before the final whistle, to give their team the three points. On 18 November, Benfica played Vitória de Guimarães on the road. They took the lead {{near the end of the}} first half, with a goal from Chano. The second half <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> additional goals, all by João Tomás. It was their first win as visitors, and they climbed to sixth place in the standings. Benfica played their last game of the month, on the 26th, at the Taça de Portugal against Campomaiorense. This fourth round match was won thanks to a late goal by Sabry.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned {{too late}} to see any combat in World War II, Boxer {{spent much of her}} career in the Pacific Ocean seeing 10 tours in the western Pacific. Her initial duties {{involved}} mostly training and exercises, including launching the first carrier-based jet aircraft, but demobilization prevented much activity in the late 1940s. At the outbreak of the Korean War, she was used as an aircraft transport before arriving off Korean waters as the third U.S. carrier to join the force. She supported the Inchon landings and subsequent invasion of North Korea, and was among the ships that provided support during the Chinese counteroffensive against an under-prepared and spread out United Nations (UN) force. She <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> subsequent combat tours in Korea conducting close air support and strategic bombing in support of UN ground troops fighting along the 38th parallel, as the battles lines had largely solidified by this time. She was awarded eight battle stars for her service in Korea.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Port Arthur on {{the second}} day of the war, Poltava was hit twice in the aft hull, Petropavlovsk was hit three times in the bow and Sevastopol was hit once. Between them, the three ships lost two men killed and seven wounded and none of them {{suffered}} any significant damage. Tsar Nicholas II relieved Stark and he was replaced by Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov who assumed command on 7 March. On 31 March, Petropavlovsk and Poltava sortied to support Russian cruisers and destroyers engaging their Japanese counterparts, but they headed back to Port Arthur to join the rest of the Pacific Squadron when the main Japanese battlefleet appeared. They ran into a newly laid minefield en route and Petropavlovsk struck at least one of the mines. Observers <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> explosions, one of which appeared to be that of her magazines, and the ship sank in less than two minutes. Casualties included Admiral Makarov and his guest, Russian battle artist Vasily Vereshchagin, 26 officers and 652 enlisted men. Only seven officers and 73 crewmen were rescued.|$|E

5|$|During the war, {{the only}} {{military}} formations {{larger than the}} army group were the military regions, which were defined by geographical boundaries, and the army corps, of which only four were formed and only during the Battle of Wuhan. In effect, the army group was the largest fighting unit of the National Revolutionary Army, and usually exercised command over two or more field armies or several corps, and assorted lesser units. They were roughly equivalent in size to an Army in British or American military terminology. By {{the end of the}} war with Japan, 40 army groups of China were in existence. The civil war <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> additional army groups being formed, even as they were gradually being replaced by newly formed army corps, by then a largely analogous formation. The following list provides an overview of the army groups in the National Revolutionary Army, including their organization, commanders, and important battles.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{started in}} Austria in December 2014, with {{production}} {{taking in the}} area around Sölden—including the Ötztal Glacier Road, Rettenbach glacier and the adjacent ski resort and cable car station—and Obertilliach and Lake Altaussee, before concluding in February 2015. Scenes filmed in Austria centred on the Ice Q Restaurant, standing in for the fictional Hoffler Klinik, a private medical clinic in the Austrian Alps. Filming included an action scene featuring a Land Rover Defender Bigfoot and a Range Rover Sport. Various airplane models were used in filming, from a life-sized plane with detachable wings to film the crash in the woods, to plane fuselages either built atop snowmobiles or shot from nitrogen cannons. Production was temporarily halted first by an injury to Craig, who sprained his knee whilst shooting a fight scene, and later by an accident involving a filming vehicle that <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> crew members injured, {{at least one of them}} seriously.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton began lapping fastest, {{recording}} a 1:32.869 on lap38, {{more than a}} second faster than first-placed Vettel. Lap45 <b>saw</b> <b>three</b> drivers set consecutive new fastest laps; Kubica's 1:32.366 was beaten by Webber with a 1:32.014s. They were then superseded by Räikkönen, who set a 1:31.691. On lap49 Webber attempted to pass Hamilton at the first chicane, but the two cars touched wheels. Webber was forced down the escape road, and when he emerged in front of Hamilton, he returned the position. Räikkönen continued {{to move through the}} field; he passed Coulthard and Piquet in separate manoeuvres to take ninthposition. Nakajima attempted to pass Coulthard into turnnine, but succeeded only in turning into the Red Bull RB4, sending it into the gravel trap. Coulthard pitted for a new front wing, which dropped him to 17th. Vettel crossed the finish line on lap53 by 12.5seconds over Kovalainen, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history to win a Grand Prix. The one-stop strategies used by Kubica and Alonso paid off as they finished in third and fourth, respectively. Heidfeld, Massa, Hamilton and Webber rounded out the top eight. Räikkönen finished in ninthposition, setting the fastest laptime of 1:28.047 on the final lap.|$|E
