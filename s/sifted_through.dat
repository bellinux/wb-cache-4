5|$|On September 20, 2003, the {{original}} {{wing of the}} Briarcliff Lodge caught fire. The owner, Barrington Venture, had planned to raze the 100-year-old building and construct a 385-unit senior living center, which was opposed by local historians and architects. The fire thus ended the preservation effort. The fire started near the main entrance and was suppressed by mid-day; it was deemed suspicious by fire officials. Residents began calling at 6:37 am, after noticing smoke coming from the site. The Briarcliff Manor Fire Department {{was the first to}} arrive, at 6:40 am, later followed by Ossining, Sleepy Hollow, Millwood, Pleasantville, Chappaqua, Croton, and Pocantico Hills, totaling about 150 firefighters. The fire also spread to the lodge's 9-story west wing, through its wooden attic even though a concrete block firewall stood between both sections. The fire departments contained the fire to prevent it from spreading north or to the village water tower, and therefore saved the water tower and village and commercial radio antennae. After the fire, Westchester County's Cause & Origin Team sent an arson investigative unit, which <b>sifted</b> <b>through</b> the debris along with trained dogs, and found no evidence of arson. Contemporary portions of the lodge and other campus buildings were later demolished.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} 1902 Briarcliff Lodge building {{burned to}} the ground on September 20, 2003. The building was scheduled for demolition within 18 months (they had applied for demolition permits the week before the fire). The owner, Barrington Venture, had planned to raze the building and construct the Garlands, a 385-unit senior living center, which was opposed by local historians and architects. The fire thus ended the preservation effort. The fire started near the main entrance and was suppressed by mid-day; it was deemed suspicious by fire officials, including Briarcliff's fire chief. Residents began calling at 6:37 am, after noticing smoke coming from the site. The Briarcliff Manor Fire Department was the first to arrive, at 6:40 am, later followed by Ossining, Sleepy Hollow, Millwood, Pleasantville, Chappaqua, Croton, and Pocantico Hills, totaling about 150 firefighters.

The fire departments contained the fire to prevent it from spreading north or to the village water tower, and therefore saved the water tower and village and commercial radio antennae. The north wing was damaged but still standing. After the fire, Westchester County's Cause & Origin Team sent an arson investigative unit, which <b>sifted</b> <b>through</b> the debris along with trained dogs, and found no evidence of arson. Most that remained of the original section was the stone facade and chimneys. Contemporary portions of the lodge and other campus buildings were later demolished.|$|E

This conclusion was shared by the local priest and author Abbé Bruno de Monts, who himself contributed essential information during the 1980s and 1990s, as well as by other French authors like Jean-Jacques Bedu and more recently David Rossoni.|$|E
25|$|A {{break in}} the case came in 1998, when police noticed that broken {{concrete}} at Miracle Motors, a business owned by Karyn's ex-father-in-law Michael Slover Sr, were similar to concrete blocks used to weigh down Karyn's body. A forensic geologist {{was brought in to}} see if anything on the Slovers' business matched evidence found {{at the scene of the}} crime. The geologist found that not only was the concrete consistent with that found at Miracle Motors, but that evidence found in the abandoned car was also likely from Slover's business. The task force <b>sifted</b> <b>through</b> dirt at Miracle Motors and eventually discovered a metal rivet and a plastic button that fit a pair of Paris Club jeans and a white shirt that Karyn had been wearing the day of her murder. Police also reported finding bones at the scene, but these were not introduced to trial and were believed to have been animal meat bones that came from food fed to two dogs that Slover used to secure the property.|$|E

25|$|However, almost {{immediately}} after the trade was finalized, Westinghouse complained to the FCC and the United States Department of Justice about NBC's coercion and a lengthy investigation was launched. On September 22, 1959, the Justice Department issued a decision which, in part, forced NBC to divest WRCV-AM-TV {{by the end of}} 1962. Several months later in early 1960, NBC announced it would trade the WRCV stations to RKO General in exchange for its Boston outlets, WNAC-AM-FM-TV. RKO would also acquire NBC's WRC-AM-FM-TV in Washington, D.C. in a separate but related sale, and NBC would replace Washington in its TV station portfolio with KTVU in the San Francisco Bay Area, to be purchased separately by the network. As regulators <b>sifted</b> <b>through</b> that multi-level transaction, Philco Corporation, the original operators of WPTZ and by this point owned by the Ford Motor Company, interjected itself into the dispute by first protesting the FCC's 1957 renewal of NBC's licenses for the WRCV stations. Then, in May 1960, Philco filed an application with the FCC to build a new station on channel 3. The sale of KTVU was cancelled and Cox Enterprises would purchase that station shortly afterwards; it is currently owned by Fox Television Stations.|$|E

While the two women never interacted on the show, he explained that Prue <b>sifted</b> <b>through</b> [...] "all of the seers in all of the history to see who best tell her what's the deal" [...] with her new powers and destiny. Shand called Kyra a vital part of Prue's plans to perform the Advent, a ritual that would resurrect a powerful race of evil demons known as the Old Ones.|$|E
