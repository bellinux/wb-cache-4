40|$|Bypass {{transition}}, i. e. {{transition of}} a boundary layer at subcritical Reynolds numbers, has been studied. Fundamental {{studies of the}} phenomenon as such have been performed {{side by side with}} experiments aimed at controlling, i. e. delaying, transition. The experiments have been performed in three different flow facilities, two with air as the working fluid (a plane channel flow and a wind-tunnel) and one with water (a water channel). From the water channel data the well known low-speed streaks appearing in a boundary layer under a turbulent free stream are found to be correlated with upward motion in the boundary layer. The streaks are found to scale in proportion to the boundary-layer thickness in both the streamwise and wall-normal directions. The streamwise length is around hundred boundary-layer thicknesses. It is found that the secondary instability of the streaks grows slower for disturbances consisting of less than four wavelengths, as compared to continuous wavetrains. Elongated low-speed structures are controlled, first in the plane channel flow and then by a reactive system in the wind-tunnel. In the channel, the breakdown of generated streaks is delayed by applying localized suction under the regions of low velocity. Measurements of the disturbance environment withand without control applied show that both the growth of the secondary instability and its spreading in the spanwise direction are reduced when applying the control. In order to be successful, the control has to be applied to a narrow region (about 1 / 10 th of a streak width) around the position of minimum velocity. The reactive system in the windtunnel, comprising four upstream sensors and four <b>suction</b> <b>ports</b> downstream, inhibits the growth of the amplitude of the streaks for a certain distance downstream of the <b>suction</b> <b>ports.</b> After the inhibited growth the disturbances start to grow again and far downstream the streak amplitude returns to close to the uncontrolled values.

50|$|A {{circulating}} pump - {{a device that}} causes the flow of liquid (e.g. water or aqueous solutions, mostly glycol) in circuits (primary or secondary) of heating or cooling installations. The {{circulating pump}}s are used only as centrifugal pumps. The basic elements of the centrifugal pump are coiled housing with two ports, suction and discharge, and what is more, blade rotor mounted on a shaft driven be an electric motor. The ports of the circulating pump can be arranged in one axis (in-line circulating pump, typically suitable to be built directly in the pipeline) or suction axis that can be perpendicular to the axis of discharge port (the so-called circulating radial pump). The mechanical energy delivered to the circulating pump via motor is transmitted through the rotor to the liquid flow causing the increase in pressure (potential energy) and speed (kinetic energy). The energy increase of the liquid occurs only in the circulating pump rotor, {{which is the only}} element of the energy transmission. However, in the remaining parts, one type of energy changes into another e.g. kinetic energy into pressure energy. For instance, in the coiled shaped housing, part of kinetic energy changes into potential energy, which causes a further increase in the fluid pressure.Pressure generated by the pump is used to overcome resistance of the liquid flow through the heating or cooling circuit. During the pump operation, there is a drop of the liquid flow {{in the center of the}} rotor, causing the inflow of the liquid through the <b>suction</b> <b>port.</b> In the event of an excessive pressure decrease, in some parts of the rotor, the pressure can be lower than the saturation pressure corresponding to the temperature of the pumped liquid, causing the so-called cavitation, i.e. liquid evaporation. To prevent this, the pressure in the <b>suction</b> <b>port</b> (at the inlet of the pump) should be higher than the saturation pressure corresponding to the liquid temperature by the net positive suction head (NPSH).|$|E

However, using the Hi-Lo® Evac endotracheal tube (Hi-Lo Evac; Mallinckrodt; Athlone, Ireland) (Evac ETT), dysfunction of the suction lumen and subsequent failure to aspirate the subglottic secretions are common. Our objective {{in this study was}} to determine the causes of suction lumen dysfunction experienced with the Evac ETT. METHODS: We studied 40 adult patients intubated with the Evac ETT. In all cases for which dysfunction of the suction lumen was observed, the subglottic <b>suction</b> <b>port</b> was examined visually using a flexible bronchoscope. RESULTS: Dysfunction of the suction lumen occurred in 19 of 40 patients (48 %). In 17 of these (43 %), it was attributed to blockage of the subglottic <b>suction</b> <b>port</b> by suctioned tracheal mucosa.

40|$|Because microaspiration of {{contaminated}} supraglottic secretions past the endotracheal tube cuff {{is considered to}} be central in the pathogenesis of pneumonia, improved design of tracheal tubes with new cuff material and shape have reduced the size and number of folds, which together with the addition of <b>suction</b> <b>ports</b> above the cuff to drain pooled subglottic secretions leads to reduced aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions. So we conducted a study to compare the prophylactic effects of polyurethane-cylindrical or tapered cuff and polyvinyl chloride cuff endotracheal tubes (ETT) on ventilator-associated pneumonia. This randomized clinical trial was carried out in a 12 bed surgical intensive care unit. 96 patients expected to require mechanical ventilation more than 96 hours were randomly allocated to one of three following groups: Polyvinyl chloride cuff (PCV) ETT, Polyurethane (PU) cylindrical Sealguard ETT and PU Taperguard ETT.

40|$|Often in air {{conditioning}} and refrigeration vapor compression systems the working fluid is mixed with lubricating oil, which flows through the system as it operates. The effects of this oil in the system include the possible degradation of heat transfer, increased pressure drop, insufficient lubrication for the compressor {{and the possibility of}} flooding the compressor <b>suction</b> <b>ports</b> with oil should the compressor valve fail. In order to quantitatively evaluate these effects on the system, {{a better understanding of the}} flow of oil through various operating conditions is required. The purpose of this investigation is the measurement of oil retention in small diameter round copper tubes with various internal geometries. Test sections include an internally smooth, an axially microfinned and a helically microfinned tube, all with an outer diameter of 9. 53 mm (3 / 8 ???). Mass fluxes of 75 to 300 kg/m 2 s are tested, with an emphasis on 75 and 150 kg/m 2 s, and qualities of 0 % to 100 % are reached.

Additionally, it is important to examine the void fraction and flow visualization of the mixtures to determine if the oil has an effect in these areas. Finally, two models have been developed for oil holdup prediction.

40|$|Swash plate {{pumps are}} widely used to drive {{hydraulic}} systems, especially because they offer high specific power. In order to improve their performance and make them more reliable, {{it is necessary to}} reduce the flow fluctuations, incorporate a control system that is more responsive, and minimize vibration levels. Furthermore, the flow should be controlled according to load requirements and pipe response at the design level. Moreover, {{there is a need to}} monitor the health of the system by analysing its vibration signatures. A novel port plate design is used with a pair of deep silencing grooves on the edges of delivery and <b>suction</b> <b>ports,</b> which reduces the flow fluctuations and improves the pump output. In addition to the load information, the pipe dynamics are also used as a control input. Hence, pipe instabilities with different boundary conditions are studied, where simple, accurate and comprehensive expressions to describe the pipe instabilities are produced, solved, and plotted. In swash plate pumps, the control unit changes the pump output according to the load requirements. The current pump design is equipped with a double negative feedback strategy. The inner loop controls the spool position, and the outer loop controls the swash plate angle. Since this design has a high rise time, it was suggested to equip the pump with a single feedback PD controller. Although this reduced the rise time, it introduced high levels of vibration. The present research proposes a new control strategy with a single feedback PID controller that minimizes vibration levels. Results are obtained experimentally. The control strategy is generalized to control the pump flow according to load requirements and pipe vibration levels. A compensation factor is introduced to moderate the negative impact of the pipe vibrations, and to generate a new set value for the inclination angle. For timely detection of faults, the application of wavelet analysis to detect different defects is examined. Some defects are produced, such as pipe flutter, pump dynamic instability, and voltage unbalance in the driving electric motor. Continuous wavelet and discrete wavelet analyses are used to analyze the vibration signature by using Debauches' mother wavelet. The data is collected experimentally.

40|$|Vortices {{interacting}} with the solid surface of aerodynamic bodies are prevalent across {{a broad range of}} geometries and applications, such as dynamic stall on wind turbine and helicopter rotors, the separated flows over flapping wings of insects, birds and micro-air vehicles, formation of the vortex wakes of bluff bodies, and the lift-producing vortices formed by aircraft leading-edge extensions and delta wings. This study provides fundamental insights into the formation and evolution of such vortices by considering the leading-edge vortices formed in variations of a canonical flapping wing problem. Specifically, the vorticity transport within three distinct experimental cases [...] 2 D plunging airfoil, 3 D plunging airfoil and 2 D plunging airfoil with suction applied at the leading edge [...] were analyzed in order to characterize the formation and evolution of the leading-edge vortex (LEV). Three-dimensional representations of the velocity and vorticity fields were obtained via multi-plane particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements and used to perform a vorticity flux analysis that served to identify the sources and sinks of vorticity within the flow. Time-resolved pressure measurements were obtained {{from the surface of the}} airfoil and used to characterize the flux of vorticity diffusing from the solid surface, and a method for correcting dynamic pressure data was developed and validated for the application within the current study. Upon characterizing all of the sources and sinks of vorticity, the circulation budget was found to be fully accounted for. Interpretation of the individual vorticity balance terms demonstrated vorticity generation and transport characteristics that were consistent among all three cases that were investigated. Three-dimensional vorticity fluxes were found to be an almost negligible contributor to the overall circulation budget, mostly due to the individual terms canceling each other out. In all cases, the diffusive flux of vorticity from the surface of the airfoil was shown to act primarily as a sink of LEV vorticity, with a magnitude roughly half that of the flux of vorticity emanating from the leading-edge shear layer. Inspection of the chordwise distribution of the diffusive flux within the 2 D case showed it to correlate very well with the evolution of the flow field. Specifically, the diffusive flux experienced a major increase during the phase interval in which the LEV remained attached to the downstream boundary layer. It was also noted that the accumulation of secondary vorticity near the leading edge prevented the diffusive flux from continuing to increase after the roll-up of the LEV. This result was validated within the 3 D case, which demonstrated that maintaining an LEV that stays attached to the downstream boundary layer produces a larger diffusive flux of vorticity [...] presumably enhancing both lift and thrust. Through the use of a spanwise array of <b>suction</b> <b>ports,</b> the <b>suction</b> case was able to successfully alter the total circulation of the flow by removing positive vorticity from the opposite-signed vortex (OSV) that formed beneath the LEV. This removal of positive vorticity produced a measured increase in the total lift, and it was noted that weakening this region of secondary vorticity allowed the LEV to impose more suction on the surface of the airfoil. However, it was also noted that weakening the OSV resulted in a loss of thrust, which was attributed to the loss of suction that occurred near the leading edge when the removal of secondary vorticity caused the energetic OSV to be reverted into a low energy region of separated flow. The physical insights provided by this work can form the basis of novel flow control strategies for enhancing the aerodynamic loads produced in unsteady, separated flows...|$|R

The fundamental physics of gas oscillation was studied by use of a lumped parameter model and a one-dimensional continuous model. However a finite element model was employed in this research to deal with the complicated geometry and large size of the three-dimensional enclosure of a real screw compressor. ^ Results of the mathematical modeling and computer simulation, were checked against the measured data and showed good agreement. Influences of gas pulsation on the compressor performance and the vibration and noise generation were studied. These studies included the calculation of the natural frequencies of the compressor shell and measurements of the acceleration and noise spectra. Acoustic properties of the steel wool demister in the discharge manifold were also measured and their influence was studied. Effects of the over/under pressure condition and the volume ratio unloading mechanism on the compressor performance and gas pulsation were investigated. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} twenty years the Centre for Positive Displacement Compressor Technology, at City University, has {{employed}} experimental techniques for the measurement of screw compressors’ performance where both experimental data and predicted mathematical models are found to be in agreement with each other. Some of the experimental measuring techniques involve the use of pressure and temperature transducers installed in the housing to determine the vital thermodynamic process characteristics and functioning performance of compressors. Moreover, as advanced technologies were available, measurements were performed in an optical compressor with a transparent window near the discharge port to allow the application of a laser technique, Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), to investigate the axial mean flow and turbulence characteristics inside the working chamber of the male rotor. Recently a prototype two-phase screw steam expander has been designed and developed as a means of power recovery from liquid geothermal brine. An experimental setup has been designed by using a set of new generation instruments to complement the unit’s numerical modeling, from which predictions of an adiabatic efficiency in the order of 70 %, were obtained. The testing includes measurements of instantaneous pressure and temperature in the <b>suction</b> and discharge <b>port,</b> instantaneous torque, speed and flow rate as well as monitoring the temperature and pressure of its lubrication system. Furthermore, four miniature high resolution pressure transducers were installed in the expander unit to measure the main rotor inter lobe temporal pressures with respect to crank angle of the main rotor. The high dynamic characteristics and response of the instrument are captured by a real time processor, National Instrument Compact-RIO, data logger and the programming is done using LabVIEW. The paper presents the measuring method, preparation of the instruments, acquisition and processing of the results obtained during experimental investigation of the two-phase screw expander...|$|R
40|$|The {{current work}} {{directly}} relates valve dynamics to the compressor energy efficiency. Majority {{of the previous}} {{studies have focused on}} reducing pressure losses due to valve geometry, towards improved compressor performance. On a complimentary note, analyzing the valve ‘flutter’ leads to a holistic valve development methodology. Traditionally, pressure actuated reed valves have been used in reciprocating hermetic compressors on the <b>suction</b> and discharge <b>ports.</b> A characteristic of these valve operation is the multiple opening and closing motions, during a single suction and discharge pulse, {{often referred to as the}} ‘valve flutter’. This is more prominent for the suction reed considering the longer (crank-angle) duration of the suction process. The valve dynamics is a highly coupled fluid structure interaction problem. In the present work, the reed valve dynamics has been simplified to a single degree of freedom spring mass system and is captured by a mathematical model within a 15 % accuracy range for displacement prediction. Considering the current stage of development, this is within acceptable limits. To validate this model, in-compressor valve lift measurements (direct strain gauge measurements) in a closed loop refrigeration rig have been used. Considering the complexity and time involved with the in-compressor measurements, a simplified framework to characterize the dynamics of reed valves outside the compressor (indirect measurements) has also been proposed and developed. Since the basis of this study is analyzing the characteristic valve dynamics, physics-based transfer functions can translate these measurements to the actual compressor reed motion leading to a faster design cycle. Also, CFD has been used to provide a detailed insight to the flow physics. With all of the above inputs, the mathematical models help identifying key design parameters and help evaluate conceptual designs towards an ideal/ chosen valve response...|$|R
