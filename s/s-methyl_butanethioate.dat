40|$|A {{climacteric}} aromatic near-isogenic line (NIL) of melon (Cucumis melo L.) SC 3 - 5 - 1 {{contained an}} introgression of the non-climacteric Korean cultivar “Shongwan Charmi” accession PI 161375 (SC) in the genetic {{background of the}} non-climacteric cultivar “Piel de Sapo” (PS). The aroma production was monitored during ripening at 21 °C in intact fruit using headspace sorptive bar extraction (HSSE). Bars were composed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and aromas were desorbed and analyzed by gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry. The aromatic profile was composed of 70 aromatic compounds plus 21 alkanes with a predominance of esters, particularly acetate (2 -methylbutyl acetate, 2 -methylpropyl acetate, hexyl acetate, and phenylmethyl acetate). Some compounds were severely affected by postharvest time. The acetate esters (3 -methylbutyl acetate, butan- 2 -yl acetate and phenylmethyl acetate) decreased with ripening and sulfur-derived compounds (<b>S-methyl</b> <b>butanethioate</b> and S-methyl 3 -methylbutanethioate) increased gradually with ripening. A few compounds increased at the senescence phase (propyl ethanoate). Other compounds such as hexadecanoic acid showed a marked decrease after harvest, some decreasing from a relative maximum at harvest (2 -methylpropyl hexanoate; n-hexanoic acid; nonanoic acid) ...|$|E
40|$|Chemical group 20 {{consists}} of aliphatic and aromatic mono- and di-thiols and mono-, di-, tri-, and polysulphides {{with or without}} additional oxygenated functional groups, of which 31 are currently authorised for use as flavours in food. The FEEDAP Panel was unable to perform an assessment of six compounds (methanethiol, methyl propyl disulphide, dipropyl trisulphide, 3 -mercaptobutan- 2 -one, 3 -(methylthio) butanal and 3 -methyl- 1, 2, 4 -trithiane) because of {{issues related to the}} purity of the compounds. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that the following 25 compounds are safe for the target species at the proposed maximum dose level (0. 05 mg/kg complete feed) : 3 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde, methyl 3 -(methylthio) propionate, allylthiol, dimethyl sulphide, dibutyl sulphide, diallyl disulphide, diallyl trisulphide, dimethyl trisulphide, dipropyl disulphide, allyl isothiocyanate, dimethyl disulphide, 2 -methylbenzene- 1 -thiol, <b>S-methyl</b> <b>butanethioate,</b> allyl methyl disulphide, 3 -(methylthio) propan- 1 -ol, 3 -(methylthio) hexan- 1 -ol, 1 -propane- 1 -thiol, diallyl sulphide, 2, 4 -dithiapentane, 2 -methyl- 2 -(methyldithio) propanal, 2 -methylpropane- 1 -thiol, methylsulfinylmethane, propane- 2 -thiol, 3, 5 -dimethyl- 1, 2, 4 -trithiolane and 2 -methyl- 4 -propyl- 1, 3 -oxathiane. No safety concern for the consumer would arise from the use of these 25 compounds of CG 20 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species, with the exception of allyl isothiocyanate. Although additional exposure to this substance through its low use level in animal feeds would not substantially increase consumer exposure, the FEEDAP Panel notes that the estimated exposure of consumers is already higher than the acceptable daily intake (ADI). All compounds should be considered irritant to skin, eyes and respiratory tract and as skin sensitisers. The proposed concentration of 0. 05 mg flavour/kg feed is not expected to cause detrimental effects to the environment, except for 2 -methylpropane- 1 -thiol, for which 0. 04 mg/kg is expected to be safe. Since all 25 compounds are used in food as flavourings and their function is essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary...|$|E
