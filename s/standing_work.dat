40|$|Objective: Effects {{of obesity}} on trunk forward flexion motion in sitting and standing, and {{postural}} adaptations and hip joint moment for a <b>standing</b> <b>work</b> task. Design: Cross-sectional comparison of obese and normal weight groups. Subjects: Ten obese subjects (waist girth 121. 216. 8 cm, {{body mass index}} (BMI) 38. 96. 6 kg m- 2) and 10 age- and height-matched normal weight subjects (waist girth 79. 66. 4 cm, BMI 21. 71. 5 kg m- 2). Methods: Trunk motion during seated and standing forward flexion, and trunk posture, hip joint moment and hip-to-bench distance during a simulated <b>standing</b> <b>work</b> task were recorded. Results: Forward flexion motion of the thoracic segment and thoracolumbar spine was decreased for the obese group with no change in pelvic segment and hip joint motion. Obese subjects showed a more flexed trunk posture and increased hip joint moment and hip-to-bench distance for a simulated <b>standing</b> <b>work</b> task. Conclusions: Decreased range of forward flexion motion, differing effects within the trunk, altered posture during a <b>standing</b> <b>work</b> task and concomitant increases in hip joint moment give insight into the aetiology of functional decrements and musculoskeletal pain seen in obesity...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{determine}} whether alternating bouts of sitting and <b>standing</b> at <b>work</b> influences daily workplace energy expenditure (EE). Methods: Twenty-three overweight/obese office workers (mean ± SD; age: 48. 2 ± 7. 9 y, body mass index: 29. 6 ± 4. 0 kg/m 2) undertook two 5 -day experimental conditions in an equal, randomized order. Participants wore a “metabolic armband” (SenseWear Armband Mini) to estimate daily workplace EE (KJ/ 8 h) while working (1) in a seated work posture (SIT condition) or (2) alternating between a <b>standing</b> and seated <b>work</b> posture every 30 minutes using a sit-stand workstation (STAND-SIT condition). To assess {{the validity of}} the metabolic armband, a criterion measure of acute EE (KJ/min; indirect calorimetry) was performed on day 4 of each condition. Results: <b>Standing</b> to <b>work</b> acutely increased EE by 0. 7 [95 % CI 0. 3 – 1. 0] KJ/min (13 %), relative to sitting (P =. 002). Compared with indirect calorimetry, the metabolic armband provided a valid estimate of EE while <b>standing</b> to <b>work</b> (mean bias: 0. 1 [– 0. 3 to 0. 4] KJ/min) but modestly overestimated EE while sitting (P =. 005). Daily workplace EE was greatest during the STAND-SIT condition (mean condition difference [95 % CI]: 76 [8 – 144] KJ/ 8 -h workday, P =. 03). Conclusions: Intermittent <b>standing</b> at <b>work</b> can modestly increase daily workplace EE compared with seated work in overweight/obese office workers...|$|R

40|$|Having {{the ability}} to change a dining table between a sitting and {{standing}} position is a niche feature. This feature was created for people that play board games regularly at a table, or for people who require use of a dining table as a <b>standing</b> <b>work</b> area. The mechanism that the table works by is using an acme threaded rod as a lead screw, with two timing belt pullies driving the shafts up and down which cause the raising and lowering of the table. These pullies were machined to incorporate an ACME threaded bolt which was welded into each pully. Due to the lead angle on the acme shafts they are self-locking which means that there {{does not need to}} be a secondary holding mechanism to prevent the table from falling once it is raised. It was designed to hold a 600 pound distributed load across the surface of the chassis with a designated factor of safety of 1. 3, which through nondestructive testing the chassis was able to support. The result is a table which can be used as a normal sit down dining table, with as little interference to comfort as possible, and can then be raised up a total of 2 feet to become a <b>standing</b> <b>work</b> table...|$|E

40|$|Measurement of leg {{swelling}} {{is widely}} used {{for the evaluation of}} the load in <b>standing</b> <b>work.</b> Measuring the leg circumference with a tape measure and the leg volume in a water tank were methods often used to measure the level of leg swelling 1).

We studied the bioelectrical impedance measuring method and found it much more sensitive than the leg circumference and leg volume measuring methods 2). This method was considered to be useful for field studies because it measures leg volume electrically and can therefore measure automatically without disturbing work. For this purpose, we developed a new portable apparatus to monitor leg swelling by an impedance method. In this paper, we giv...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The risk of {{developing}} injuries during <b>standing</b> <b>work</b> may vary between persons with different foot types. High arched and low arched feet, as well as rigid and flexible feet, are considered to have different injury profiles, while those with normal arches may sustain fewer injuries. However, the cut-off values for maximum values (subtalar position during weight-bearing) and range of motion (ROM) values (difference between subtalar neutral and subtalar resting position in a weight-bearing condition) for the medial longitudinal arch (MLA) are largely unknown. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify cut-off values for maximum values and ROM of the MLA of the foot during static tests and to identify factors influencing foot posture. Methods The participants consisted of 254 volunteers from Central and Northern Denmark (198 m/ 56 f; age 39. 0 ± 11. 7 years; BMI 27. 3 ± 4. 7 kg/m 2). Navicular height (NH), longitudinal arch angle (LAA) and Feiss line (FL) were measured for either the left or the right foot in a subtalar neutral position and subtalar resting position. Maximum values and ROM were calculated for each test. The 95 % and 68 % prediction intervals were used as cut-off limits. Multiple regression analysis was used to detect influencing factors on foot posture. Results The 68 % cut-off values for maximum MLA values and MLA ROM for NH were 3. 6 to 5. 5 cm and 0. 6 to 1. 8 cm, respectively, without taking into account the influence of other variables. Normal maximum LAA values were between 131 and 152 ° and normal LAA ROM was between - 1 and 13 °. Normal maximum FL values were between - 2. 6 and - 1. 2 cm and normal FL ROM was between - 0. 1 and 0. 9 cm. Results from the multivariate linear regression revealed an association between foot size with FL, LAA, and navicular drop. Conclusions The cut-off values presented in this study can be used to categorize people performing <b>standing</b> <b>work</b> into groups of different foot arch types. The results of this study are important for investigating a possible link between arch height and arch movement and the development of injuries. </p...|$|E

40|$|Open {{infrastructures}} {{for publishing}} 	 	Dynamic publishing offers publishers {{one of the}} few routes to audience growth and financial sustainability in an age of digital disruption. 	 Dynamic publishing is a digital workflow where the publication processes are automated (layout, multi-format conversion, distribution, rights clearance, translation workflows and payments) and made available on request for reuse, to give access to new audiences and revenues. Currently, the majority of publishers are excluded from the dynamic publishing arena. The software systems on offer are either too expensive on the high-end of the product range or not ‘fit for purpose’ on the low-end. 	 	The objective of the Hybrid Publishing Consortium (HPC) is to significantly lower the price of professional digital publishing systems through the creation of open infrastructure for publishing based on free software and open standards.

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} (1) the physical workload on neck and upper limb in computer-aided design (CAD) work; (2) the impact of two applications (PROFESSIONAL-CADAM and PRO/Engineering) and (3) two input devices (computer mouse and keyboard), as well as (4) sitting and <b>standing</b> <b>work</b> positions. Fifteen CAD operators were interviewed and examined physically. For nine subjects, the physical workload was measured: electromyography (EMG) of trapezius and forearm extensor muscles, inclinometry of the head, the upper back and upper arms, as well as wrist goniometry. The muscular load was low in CAD work, but the inter-individual variation was considerable. Neither the positions were extreme, nor the movements. The applications, per se, {{did not have a}} large impact on the workload, but because of the need for different input devices the effect was strong. Using a keyboard meant higher angular velocities than using a mouse. Hence, when choosing a new software, which requires mainly a mouse as input device, this has to be balanced against the risk of disorders...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} two {{questions}} {{of interest for}} the strategy-as-practice <b>standing</b> <b>work</b> group: what strategists do, and what influence the work of strategizing. We explore how strategists progressively build structures for action which in turn constrain their ability to create strategic knowledge. We don’t want to unveil how macro structures influence daily activities. Rather, we study how they are built up from these micro activities. To do so, we use a two-steps methodology based on detailed analyses of strategists ’ daily activities. First, we generate a taxonomy of activities in order {{to pick out the}} ones concerned with macro-structure creations from the job-related ones. Second, we analyze their evolution in terms of intensity, frequency and outcomes. We study how they lead to the establishment of particular macro-structures: attention structures, which are central to knowledge creation processes. In this research, we use a particular research field: a Business Intelligence Service (BIS). Within large organizations, strategy building is distributed between different services, and external analysis is often devoted, at least partially, to BIS (Choudhury and Sampler, 1997). Yet theoretical papers from the strategy-as-practice field (e. g. Whittington, 2002) evok...|$|E
