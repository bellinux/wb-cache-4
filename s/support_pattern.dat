40|$|This study {{sought to}} develop the parental support scale for children's {{physical}} activity, and {{to examine the relationship}} between the parental <b>support</b> <b>pattern</b> for children's physical activity and the physical activity level of children. In study 1, subjects were 230 parents with elementary school children (Grades 4 through 6). Factor analysis revealed that the parental support scale for children's physical activity had a two factor structure (Factor I : parental encouragement/facilitation, Factor II : parental modeling/invovement), consisting of 15 items; the scale showed high reliability and validity. Participants in study 2 conducted to examine the relation between the parental support patterns for children's physical activity and the physical activity level of children, were 230 elementary school students and their parents. As a result of Cluster analysis, it revealed that there are 4 clusters (”No modeling/Involvement type”, ”No Support type”, ”No Encouragement/Facilitation type” and ”Support type”) concerning with the parental <b>support</b> <b>pattern</b> for children's physical activity. ANOVA was conducted {{to examine the relationship between}} the parental support patterns for children's physical activity and the physical activity level of children. As result of ANOVA, it revealed that the scores for the physical activity of children differed significantly across the 4 types of parental <b>support</b> <b>pattern.</b> The children belonging to ”Support type” and ”No Modeling/Involvement type” have almost higher scores for physical activity level than ”No Supprot type”.

30|$|In {{previous}} studies, {{the evaluation}} of statically stable gaits depends {{on the relationship between}} the vertical projection of the center of mass and the support polygon. If the vertical projection of the center of mass is located in the support polygon, the robot is stable; otherwise, the robot is not in the stable state. This approach ignores the impact of inertial force generated by the acceleration and deceleration of the robot. The “stability margin” is defined as the shortest distance from the vertical projection of the center of gravity to the boundaries of the <b>support</b> <b>pattern</b> in the horizontal plane [43]. However, in some cases, despite the vertical projection of the robot’s center of mass being in the support polygon, the reaction force of the ground required owing to the acceleration of the robot exceeds the force that the ground can provide. If the standing feet slips on the ground, the robot will not be in a stable state. Quadruped robots often use the dynamic stable gait to obtain high walking efficiency. The zero-moment point (ZMP) if often used to estimate the dynamic stability of robots [44]. When the ZMP is located in the standing foot, the robot is stable; otherwise, it is not. The “stability margin” of the dynamic stable gaits are defined as the shortest distance from the ZMP to the boundaries of the <b>support</b> <b>pattern</b> [45].|$|E

40|$|Context: Social {{support has}} been {{identified}} as an important factor in facilitating recovery from injury. However, no previous study has prospectively assessed the change in social <b>support</b> <b>patterns</b> before and after injury. Objective: To examine the pre- and post-injury social <b>support</b> <b>patterns</b> among male and female collegiate athletes. Design: A prospective design with repeated measures. Injury incidence was identified using the Sports Injury Monitoring System (SIMS). Data on pre- and post-injury social <b>support</b> <b>patterns</b> were compared. Setting: The study was conducted at one Big Ten Conference university. Patient or other participants: A total of 256 Division I male and female collegiate athletes age 18 or older from 13 sports teams were included. Data collection and analysis: Data were collected between September 1, 2005 and April 30, 2006. Social support was measured using the 6 -item Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ 6). Gender differences in athletes’ sources of and satisfaction with social support before and after injury were assessed, using a McNemar’s test and paired t-test, respectively. Results: Male athletes reported more sources of social support than female athletes, while female athletes had a greater satisfaction with the support they received. Athletes’ social <b>support</b> <b>patterns</b> changed after they became injured. Injured athletes reported relying more on coaches (p =. 003), physicians (p =. 003), and athletic trainers (p <. 0001) for social support after they became injured. Athletes also reported significantly greater post-injury satisfaction with social support received from friends (p =. 019), coaches (p =. 001), physicians (p =. 003), and athletic trainers (p &. 0001). Conclusions: Our findings identify an urgent need to better define the psychosocial needs of injured athletes, and also strongly suggest that athletic trainers have a critical role in meeting these needs...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we improve the UML 2. 0 Collaboration Templates {{mechanism}} to better <b>support</b> <b>patterns</b> in UML CASE tools. Collaboration Templates are not versatile enough to <b>support</b> <b>patterns</b> correctly. First, they constrain their parameters inappropriately. Second, the instantiation of UML Collaboration Templates {{does not allow}} to modify or to suppress model elements which is sometimes necessary. Both problems {{make it difficult to}} maintain the UML models consistency when applying patterns and proves that the Collaboration Templates is a real source of possible inconsistencies. We thus propose to explicitly constrain Collaboration Template parameters using OCL and to allow the suppression or modification of model elements. We have prototyped this approach in the Objecteering UML CASE tool. Both these improvements proved quite useful in several applications, and will be included in a future version of the Objecteering CASE tool. 1...|$|R
