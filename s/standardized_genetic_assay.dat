40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the yeast three-hybrid system provides a <b>genetic</b> <b>assay</b> of both RNA and protein components for avian retroviral RNA encapsidation. In the current study, we used this assay to precisely define cis-acting determinants involved in avian leukosis sarcoma virus packaging RNA binding to Gag protein. In vivo screening of Rous sarcoma virus mutants was performed with randomly mutated minimal packaging sequences (MΨ) made using PCR amplification after cotransformation with GagΔPR protein into yeast cells. Colonies with low β-galactosidase activity were analyzed to locate mutations in MΨ sequences affecting binding to Gag proteins. This <b>genetic</b> <b>assay</b> delineated secondary structural elements that are important for efficient RNA binding, including a single-stranded small bulge containing the initiation codon for uORF 3, as well as adjacent stem structures. This implies a possible tertiary structure favoring the high-affinity binding sites for Gag.

40|$|Mutations in {{the human}} ABCC 6 gene cause pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a {{hereditary}} disorder that impacts the skin, eyes, and cardiovascular system. Currently, the diagnosis of PXE is based on physical findings and histological examination of a biopsy of affected skin. We have combined two simple, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based methods to develop a rapid, reliable <b>genetic</b> <b>assay</b> {{for the majority of}} known PXE mutations. After PCR amplification and heteroduplex formation, mutations in exon 24 and exon 28 of the ABCC 6 gene were detected with Surveyor nuclease, which cleaves double-stranded DNA at any mismatch site. Mutations originating from deletion of a segment of the ABCC 6 gene between exon 23 and exon 29 (ex 23 _ex 29 del) were detected by long-range PCR. Size analysis of digestion fragments and long-range PCR products was performed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The methods accurately identified mutations or the absence thereof in 16 affected individuals as confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fifteen patients had one or two point mutations, and two of these individuals carried the ex 23 _ex 29 del in their second allele. This mutation detection and mapping strategy provides a simple and reliable <b>genetic</b> <b>assay</b> to assist in diagnosis of PXE, differential diagnosis of PXE-like conditions, and study of PXE genetics...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of {{membrane}} protein interactions {{is difficult because}} of the hydrophobic nature of these proteins, which often renders conventional biochemical and <b>genetic</b> <b>assays</b> fruitless. This is a substantial problem because proteins that are integral or associated with membranes represent approximately one-third of all proteins in a typical eukaryotic cell. We have shown previously that the modified split-ubiquitin system {{can be used as}} a <b>genetic</b> <b>assay</b> for the in vivo detection of interactions between the two characterized yeast trans{{membrane protein}}s, Ost 1 p and Wbp 1 p. This so-called split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid (YTH) system uses the split-ubiquitin approach in which reconstitution of two ubiquitin halves is mediated by a protein–protein interaction. Here we converted the split-ubiquitin membrane YTH system into a generally applicable in vivo screening approach to identify interacting partners of a particular mammalian transmembrane protein. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach by using the mammalian ErbB 3 receptor as bait and have identified three previously unknown ErbB 3 -interacting proteins. In addition, we have confirmed one of the newly found interactions between ErbB 3 and the membrane-associated RGS 4 protein by coimmunoprecipitating the two proteins from human cells. We expect the split-ubiquitin membrane YTH technology to be valuable for the identification of potential interacting partners of integral membrane proteins from many model organisms...|$|R

We have developed a strategy that facilitates the recovery of exons from random pieces of cloned genomic DNA.

40|$|Abstract Background Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} topoisomerase I (MtTOP 1) and Escherichia coli topoisomerase I have highly homologous transesterification domains, {{but the two}} enzymes have {{distinctly different}} C-terminal domains. To investigate the structure-function of MtTOP 1 and to target its activity for development of new TB therapy, it is desirable to have a rapid <b>genetic</b> <b>assay</b> for its catalytic activity, and potential bactericidal consequence from accumulation of its covalent complex. Results We show that plasmid-encoded recombinant MtTOP 1 can complement the temperature sensitive topA function of E. coli strain AS 17. Moreover, expression of MtTOP 1 -G 116 S enzyme with the TOPRIM mutation that inhibits DNA religation results in SOS induction and loss of viability in E. coli. The absence of cysteine residues in the MtTOP 1 enzyme makes it an attractive system for introduction of potentially informative chemical or spectroscopic probes at specific positions via cysteine mutagenesis. Such probes could be useful for development of high throughput screening (HTS) assays. We employed the AS 17 complementation system to screen for sites in MtTOP 1 that can tolerate cysteine substitution without loss of complementation function. These cysteine substitution mutants were confirmed to have retained the relaxation activity. One such mutant of MtTOP 1 was utilized for fluorescence probe incorporation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurement with fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotide substrate. Conclusions The DNA relaxation and cleavage complex accumulation of M. tuberculosis topoisomerase I can be measured with <b>genetic</b> <b>assays</b> in E. coli, facilitating rapid analysis of its activities, and discovery of new TB therapy targeting this essential enzyme. </p...|$|R
40|$|Mobile group II introns encode {{a reverse}} {{transcriptase}} that binds the intron RNA to promote RNA splicing and intron mobility, the latter via reverse splicing of the excised intron into DNA sites, followed by reverse transcription. Previous work {{showed that the}} Lactococcus lactis Ll. LtrB intron reverse transcriptase, denoted LtrA protein, binds with high affinity to DIVa, a stem–loop structure {{at the beginning of}} the LtrA open reading frame and makes additional contacts with intron core regions that stabilize the active RNA structure for forward and reverse splicing. LtrA's binding to DIVa down-regulates its translation and is critical for initiation of reverse transcription. Here, by using high-throughput unigenic evolution analysis with a <b>genetic</b> <b>assay</b> in which LtrA binding to DIVa down-regulates translation of GFP, we identified regions at LtrA's N terminus that are required for DIVa binding. Then, by similar analysis with a reciprocal <b>genetic</b> <b>assay,</b> we confirmed that residual splicing of a mutant intron lacking DIVa does not require these N-terminal regions, but does require other reverse transcriptase (RT) and X/thumb domain regions that bind the intron core. We also show that N-terminal fragments of LtrA by themselves bind specifically to DIVa in vivo and in vitro. Our results suggest a model in which the N terminus of nascent LtrA binds DIVa of the intron RNA that encoded it and nucleates further interactions with core regions that promote RNP assembly for RNA splicing and intron mobility. Features of this model may be relevant to evolutionarily related non-long-terminal-repeat (non-LTR) -retrotransposon RTs...|$|R
