5|$|Wasting no time, Trish evacuates the innocents of Fortuna, while Dante stays busy {{destroying}} the false Hell Gates which brought the demon army, reclaiming Yamato after defeating Agnus, and finally going head-to-head with The Savior in an epic sky battle above Fortuna, as Sanctus controls it from within. With Nero still captured inside The Savior, Dante {{is able to}} drive Yamato through The Savior’s chest, freeing Nero, who reclaims it inside. In a final battle inside The Savior, Nero destroys Sanctus and saves Kyrie. Though <b>still</b> <b>coming</b> {{to terms with his}} as-of-yet unclear ties to the Sparda bloodline, Nero is finally able to make peace with it, after acknowledging the power it has given him to protect those he cares about.|$|E

Several flights a day land in Saipan, mostly {{in the early hours}} between 1:00 AM and 3:30 AM.

25|$|Toungoo {{was to get}} a {{much needed}} breather, however. For much of the rainy season of 1542, the Confederation chiefs were <b>still</b> <b>coming</b> to terms with their new leader Hkonmaing (son of Hkonmaing I of Onbaung), and {{had no time to}} plan for an invasion. Initially, the {{leadership}} of Mohnyin was deeply unsatisfied with Hkonmaing, who was put on the throne by the Ava court, not only because the heirs of Sawlon felt the throne of Ava was theirs but also because Hkonmaing's father was someone they bitterly fought against in the 1520s. In the end, in August/September 1542, the chiefs reluctantly decided to back Hkonmaing, and form a united front against a rising Toungoo. They agreed to invade Lower Burma in the dry season of 1543–44.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{being the}} short course World Champion, Seto was <b>still</b> <b>coming</b> into the 2013 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Spain {{relatively}} unknown, mostly due to Japanese medley star Kosuke Hagino. He once again swam both individual medley events. In the 200 m, his first event, he swam a personal {{best in the}} semifinals {{with a time of}} 1:58.03, and then finished a touch slower in the final the next night to finish seventh overall. In his best event, the 400 m individual medley, Seto qualified first for the final and then surprisingly won his first long course world champion title by finishing first in a time of 4:08.69, about half a second ahead of second-place finisher Chase Kalisz. He is the second fastest Asian performer in the event, behind Hagino.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with The Pulse of Radio, vocalist Taylor said that Slipknot would be changing their stage set around for the US arena leg. [...] "We're {{getting away from the}} pyro.

[...] He explained that they always try to do something different: [...] "We've got people <b>still</b> <b>coming</b> to see us for, you know, after ten years, and we just want to try and give something special." [...] On the opening show of the leg, percussionist Crahan debuted a new mask which was significantly different from the one he wore while touring in 2008.|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, Tim Ferguson {{revealed}} that the break-up was {{due in large part}} to personal health issues. [...] Unknown to the public at the time, Ferguson had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996 after experiencing symptoms for several years including a few severe episodes while touring in 1993. [...] The symptoms affected his mobility, causing him to struggle with choreography and physical routines onstage and eventually, he says, [...] "it was clear I couldn't remain a Doug Anthony Allstar with whatever this was". <b>Still</b> <b>coming</b> to terms with his diagnosis, Ferguson chose to keep it private, telling few people outside of his close friends and family.

500|$|A {{spokesperson}} for Hollyoaks confirmed that Ste didn't realise [...] "how much {{power and control}} Brendan was wielding over him". This was because Ste was <b>still</b> <b>coming</b> {{to terms with his}} sexuality. Ste felt a connection he never felt before because he hadn't had another male partner. Brendan manipulated Ste into believing he was to blame for Brendan's anger. The representative said this was why he ended up apologising. The storyline also aimed to shock viewers with the [...] "dark depths" [...] Brendan would go to in order to control Ste. Marquess later stated that Brendan's past would be explained and that everyone should remember it was Ste who used to hit Amy first, adding: [...] "So it's a dark and interwoven story made all the more complicated by the introduction of a new love interest for Ste".|$|E
500|$|Livingstone has {{consistently}} rejected being defined under any particular ideological current of socialism. Recognising this, in 2000, the former Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock asserted that Livingstone {{could only be}} defined as a [...] "Kennist". Livingstone's understanding of politics arises from his studies of animal behaviour and anthropology; rejecting the idea that the human species is naturally progressing (a view advocated by socialists like the Fabian Society), Livingstone instead took the view that human society is <b>still</b> <b>coming</b> to terms with the massive socio-economic changes that it experienced upon the development of agriculture during the Neolithic. Highlighting that a hunter-gatherer mode of subsistence is more natural to the human species, he believes that modern society has to adopt many hunter-gatherer values – namely mutual co-operation and emphasis on human relationships rather than consumerism – in order to survive.|$|E
500|$|During {{the writing}} for the season, Ward and series' head writer Kent Osborne noted that it was {{increasingly}} difficult to produce new episode concepts because the writers had [...] "already used a lot of cool ideas". Osborne called this slump the [...] "season four blues". Ward went on to clarify that, [...] "everything's <b>still</b> <b>coming</b> out super weird and interesting—but it just gets a little harder. You have to dig deeper." [...] To combat these issues, the writer staff tried different story writing methods, such as a technique called exquisite corpse, in which one writer starts a story {{on a sheet of}} paper, and the paper is folded and another writer tries to finish it. Ward, however, noted that [...] "the ideas are usually terrible". They also decided to experiment with different types of storytelling and to introduce more new characters to the show.|$|E

500|$|In the 19th century {{maintaining}} Montreal's {{drinking water}} became increasingly difficult {{with the rapid}} increase in population. [...] A majority of the drinking water was <b>still</b> <b>coming</b> from the city's harbor, which was busy and heavily trafficked leading to {{the deterioration of the}} water within. [...] In the mid 1840s the City of Montreal installed a water system that would pump water from the St. Lawrence and into cisterns. [...] The cisterns would then be transported to the desired location. [...] This was not the first water system of its type in Montreal as there had been one in private ownership since 1801. [...] In the middle of the 19th century water distribution was carried out by [...] "fontainiers". [...] The fountainiers would open and close water valves outside of buildings, as directed, all over the city. [...] As they lacked modern plumbing systems it was impossible to connect all buildings at once and it also acted as a conservation method. [...] The population was not finished rising yet however, from 58,000 in 1852 it rose to 267,000 by 1901.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was filmed in Johannesburg, South Africa, and {{was directed by}} British director Sophie Muller back-to-back with the video for [...] "Better in Time". It premiered on Lewis official website and BBC Radio 1's website on 27February2008. The video begins with the message [...] "Working to change lives across the world, in support of Sport Relief". Then, it intercuts a performance of Lewis {{in front of a}} wall and greyscale scenes: an image of a child walking on a landfill site, a funeral, a child lying in the street, and a kid sat in a traffic island. As the first chorus begins, the video continues showing scenes of poverty and AIDS issues in the country. Whilst the second verse goes, pictures of malnourished people appears. As the second chorus and the bridge elapse people crying <b>still</b> <b>coming</b> on the scene. But whereas The Tuff Session Singers start to sing the third chorus, the video begins to show images of kids playing association football and cricket. The video ends with children smiling as Lewis sings the outro of the song. It was released on the US iTunes Store on 3February2009.|$|E
500|$|The Who took a {{break from}} {{recording}} {{at the end of}} 1968 to tour, including a well received appearance at The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus on 10 December. They resumed sessions at IBC in January 1969, block booking Monday to Thursday, but had to do gigs every weekend to stop going further into debt. A major tour was booked for the end of April, and the group's management insisted that the album would have to be finished by then, as it had been well over a year since The Who Sell Out. Lambert wrote a script, Tommy (1914–1984) which he professionally printed, and gave copies to the band, which helped them focus the storyline, and also decide to make the album a double. The group were <b>still</b> <b>coming</b> up with new material; Lambert insisted that the piece should have a proper overture, while Townshend wrote [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] so that Nik Cohn, a pinball fan, would give the album a favourable review in the New York Times. Lambert wanted an orchestra to appear on the album, but Townshend was strongly against the idea, and time and budget constraints meant it could not happen anyway.|$|E
