As of January 2017, 34 police officers from Madagascar are deployed in Haiti {{as part of}} the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti. Starting in 2015, under the direction of and with assistance from the UN, the World Food Programme started the Madagascar Country Programme with the two main goals of long-term development/ reconstruction efforts and addressing the food insecurity issues in the southern regions of Madagascar. These goals plan to be accomplished by providing meals for specific schools in rural and urban priority areas and by developing national <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country. Small and local farmers have also been assisted in increasing both {{the quantity and quality of}} their production, as well as improving their crop yield in unfavorable weather conditions.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> {{programs}} {{in a number}} of countries, each program varies widely from country to country in design, implementation, and evaluation. Thus, literature reviews and studies often focus on a small number of countries, as <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> is not a uniform unit of intervention and cannot be compared or assessed on an international scale.|$|E

25|$|Schools {{have become}} a natural and {{convenient}} setting {{for the implementation of}} health and education interventions. <b>School</b> <b>feeding</b> is just one facet of school health initiatives, as other programs may include de-worming, HIV/AIDS prevention and education, and life and health skills education. Overall, <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs have been shown to directly increase the educational and nutritional status of recipient children, and indirectly impact the economic and social lives of themselves and their family. Additionally, <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> directly addresses the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of reducing hunger by one-half, achieving universal primary education, and achieving gender parity in education by 2015.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> {{programs}} are community-specific and require {{a great deal}} of planning, the sustainability of <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs is a main point of concern for many countries. Countries are very limited on the demands placed on the staff, resources, and infrastructure required for school-feeding programs, and often have to rely on outside financial and personnel help to continue programs for a significant amount of time.|$|E
25|$|The Country Programme (CP) has two parts: {{food and}} {{nutritional}} assistance {{to people with}} HIV/AIDS, and a <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> program for all primary schools in the Sahel region. The HIV/AIDS nutrition program aims to better the nutritional recovery {{of those who are}} living with HIV/AIDS and to protect at-risk children and orphans from malnutrition and food security. As part of the <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> component, the Country Programme's goals are to increase enrollment and attendance in schools in the Sahel region, where enrollment rates are below the national average. Furthermore, the program aims at improving gender parity rates in these schools, by providing girls with high attendance {{in the last two years}} of primary school with take-home rations of cereals as an incentive to households, encouraging them to send their girls to school.|$|E

25|$|<b>School</b> <b>feeding</b> {{programs}} {{have the capacity}} to increase gender equity in access to education, which allows for gender equity across all spheres of social and economic life. There are a variety of reasons that girls' education is impacted by factors on both the supply and demand side of schooling. These include gender-stereotyped curriculum and teaching practices, increased risks for girls' safety outside of the house, socio-cultural practices that cause girls' education to hold a very low value, and school infrastructure that is not suitable for girls. Due to the combination of such barriers, girls are disproportionately affected by the direct and opportunity cost of schooling, which prevents girls from very poor households from attending school. Opportunity costs for girls' education include lost time that would otherwise be spent doing household chores and care work. <b>School</b> <b>feeding</b> programs reduce the costs of sending girls to school and allow for an increased number of girls to be sent to school by their families. Furthermore, improvements in female literacy that come from increased education have been linked to declining rates of fertility, increased economic opportunities, and other markers of female empowerment.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} ways to {{distribute}} food through <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs: on-site meals and take-home rations. On-site meals are foods that are distributed to children while at school during morning and afternoon meal and snack times, which may include a bowl of porridge or nutrient-fortified crackers. Take-home rations are a collection of basic food items, such as a bag of rice {{and a bottle of}} cooking oil, which may be sent home and transferred to the families of girls that regularly attend school.|$|E

2500|$|According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, {{there are}} five stages of <b>school</b> <b>feeding.</b> The first stage {{includes}} <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs that rely mostly on external funding and implementation, while the last stage includes <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs that rely mostly on internal government funding and implementation. Countries that are within the first stage include Afghanistan and Sudan, where country governments are unable to lead <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs. Countries that are within the fifth stage include Chile and India, which have functional, country-led <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs. For example, the Government of Chile has provided a <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> program for over 40 years through the La Junta Nacional de Auxilio Escolar y Becas (National Board of School Assistance and Scholarships) through a public-private partnership. This program involves technology that allows food to be centrally mass-produced and then distributed across the country. [...] Additionally, the Government of India has supported <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs since 2001, when the country recognized Indians' Constitutional Right to Food. Countries {{that are in the}} middle of the stages, such as Kenya and Ecuador may have some but not all of the governmental policies, financial capacities, or institutional capacities to operate <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs without external funding or implementation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>School</b> <b>feeding</b> {{programs}} are very context-specific, and each community's program must be altered {{based on the}} demographics, geography, and other patterns within and outside of schools.

2500|$|While <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> {{programs}} {{have a variety}} of positive impacts, there are some possible negative impacts these programs can cause. For example, <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs can increase the cost of schooling by requiring that communities provide fire-wood for cooking as well as other items such as fresh-fruit, vegetables, and condiments. Additionally, communities are also expected to provide people who can cook these meals and maintain stores of all of the required food products, as well as kitchens and other fundamentals of meal provision. By causing a variety of needs and requirements to increase in a given community, the net benefit to a community from <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs may be reduced.|$|E
2500|$|Though <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> {{produces}} {{a variety of}} anticipated impacts, as mentioned above, much research and evaluation {{is being done to}} determine the results of <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs in low-income countries. <b>School</b> <b>feeding</b> program results are often context-specific, but lessons from a variety of communities can help evaluate <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> program effectiveness. Researchers at the International Food Policy Research Institute have critically assessed evidence from developing countries to define preliminary results of these programs. [...] These assessments found that the timing of meals is not a critical factor in the positive effects on learning and cognition, and thus take-home rations can perform as well as in-school meals, and that in-school meals may even disrupt learning. [...] In some settings, take-home rations are more cost-effective than in-school meals, and the study argued that some country programs may be optimized by focusing resources on take-home rations. Additionally, it was found that in the study setting, school attendance improved learning more significantly than nutrition status improvements, but that <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs encouraged attendance and still have a positive net result on education levels. In a study done by Patrick J. McEwan, it was shown that {{there is no evidence that}} higher-calorie meals positively impact school enrollment and attendance, first-grade enrollment age and grade repetition, and fourth-grade test scores over average-calorie <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> meals in Chile's national program. [...] Thus, McEwan's study suggested that Chilean policy, to produce significant positive results, should focus more on the nutritional composition of school meals, rather than caloric content alone.|$|E
2500|$|While {{school meals}} are {{provided}} by the governments of most high and middle-income countries around the globe, the children who may benefit most from <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs are in low-income countries {{that do not have}} government-provided school meals. <b>School</b> <b>feeding</b> in low-income countries often starts through funding by international organizations such as the United Nations World Food Programme or the World Bank or national governments through programs such as the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. However, some governments have first started school-feeding programs and then requested the help of these organizations and programs. Additionally, many countries have [...] "graduated" [...] from their dependency on foreign assistance by reshaping their <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs to be country-led and self-supported.|$|E

2500|$|<b>School</b> <b>feeding</b> {{programs}} have been defined by the World Bank as [...] "targeted social safety nets that provide both educational and health benefits to the most vulnerable children, thereby increasing enrollment rates, reducing absenteeism, and improving food security at the household level". Beyond improvements in access to food, <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs also {{have a positive impact}} on nutritional status, gender equity, and educational status, each of which contributes to improving overall levels of country and human development.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the food}} items needed for <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> {{programs}} may be imported {{into the country}} from anywhere throughout the world, {{an increasing number of}} countries and organizations are looking to expand what is called [...] "home-grown school feeding," [...] which requires that provided food is produced and purchased within a country to the greatest extent possible. These programs provide an opportunity for children to receive improved nutrition and educational opportunities while also allowing smallholder farmers to benefit from access to a market with stable, structured, and predictable demand. The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) guided governments in Sub-Saharan Africa to include home-grown <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> as a critical intervention for the food security facet of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). Several countries, including Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mali and Nigeria are currently taking part in home-grown <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs.|$|E
2500|$|Education {{is a key}} {{component}} in <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs and global development because overall, a more educated person has an increased amount of opportunities in life, earns more money, and has {{a higher standard of}} living than an uneducated individual. School meals greatly impact recipient children's education status by increasing school enrollment and attendance, decreasing drop-out rates, and improving cognitive abilities and learning achievements. Generally, sending children to a school in which school-meals are served offsets the financial and opportunity costs of schooling, and thus families are incentivized {{to send their children to}} school. Additionally, <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs may serve as an incentive for students to go to school to receive food rather than missing out on food by staying home. [...] The increased nutrition status of children, as a result of <b>school</b> <b>feeding</b> programs, also enhances students' cognitive abilities and performance in school.|$|E
