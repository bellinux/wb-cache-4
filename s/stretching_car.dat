40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and validate the Daily Exposure to Vibration A(8) and Vibration Dose Value (VDV) experienced by the car driver, with care taken to elucidate the effects of WBV on the human body and all at once to introduce a newly developed real-time WBV measurement instrumentation. Cars are one of the most important transportation worldwide. It plays a significant role for the human to travel from one place to the other places promptly. However, high magnitude Whole-Body Vibration (WBV) that can be associated with car may lead to various diseases and health problems, such as lower back pain, in humans. This study was conducted on a national car. The WBV exposure was measured for 10 min. Data was collected using an IEPE (ICP TM) accelerometer sensor connected to a DT 9837 device, capable of effectively measuring and analyzing the vibrations. The vibration results were displayed on a personal computer using a custom Graphical User Interface (GUI). MATLAB software was used to interpret the results and determine the WBV exposure level. The values of Daily Exposure to Vibration A(8) and the Vibration Dose Value (VDV) during one <b>stretch</b> of <b>car</b> travel were measured as 0. 8778 and 3. 8862 m sec - 1. 75, respectively.

50|$|Why {{were they}} called coachbuilders? Because {{it was a}} big job, and these modern cars did not have enough {{structural}} integrity to withstand the loss of the roof structure. The coachbuilder would have to re-engineer the structure of the car, often adding hundreds of pounds of steel, prior to removing the roof and fitting the convertible mechanism. They would then have to make new interior and exterior trim for all the places that they had to cut, and make it look, feel, and drive like {{it was meant to be}} a convertible. It would also have to be safe. It was no small task. Coachbuilding was a trade that had been around for centuries. Before there were cars, there were horse-drawn coaches, and they were all made by hand. With the advent of the automobile, the coachbuilders adapted to the changing times, and made bodies for cars. These car bodies were made by hand, out of wood and later steel, and mounted on to the automobile frame. The coachbuilder would be responsible for the interior as well. Eventually car companies started making their own pressed steel bodies. The only remaining market for coachbuilders was the very expensive cars like Duesenburgs, Rolls Royces, and the biggest Packards. This work eventually died down too, but there would always be coachbuilders around. The firm of Mulliner Park Ward, for example, would build Corniche bodies for Rolls Royce and Bentley until 1995. Most modern day coachbuilders are in the business of modifying car bodies. They modify cars into hearses, ambulances, flower <b>cars,</b> <b>stretch</b> limousines, and of course convertibles.|$|R

Working together, Rick and Michonne drive on opposite sides of the herd, slicing hundreds of walkers to bits with the cord, and make their way to the SUV. Rick's group returns to Alexandria moments before Simon (Steven Ogg) arrives with a group of Saviors. Unannounced, an intimidating Simon tells Rick they're looking for Daryl.

40|$|Electroencephalogram (EEG) {{is a well}} known, {{and well}} used method for {{studying}} brain activity, and it's possibilities have lately <b>stretched</b> into the <b>car</b> industry, were it's capabilities of detecting sleepiness in drivers are currently being put to the test. When performing EEG signal analysis on the brain, standardized signal bands exists that are characteristic to specific states of mind, such as when a driver is feeling sleepy. However, EEG as a method for studying the brain has major problems. The signal contains {{a lot of information}} that can be redundant or irrelevant, and the result is easily influenced and deviant by other parameters, that can cause incorrectness and inaccuracy in the final prediction and classification of the signal frame. One of the important methods for reducing this inaccuracy of EEG, and also reducing the computational cost of the diagnose, is feature selection. Finding key features in the signal, that can support a reliable diagnosis of a specific state of mind, is of great importance. Especially since learning systems, incorrectly predicting or interpreting a signal in the classification stage, can lead to incorrect triggering of safety features in futuristic cars, such as cruiser control. There are many existing feature selection algorithms available, and features that has been tried in different research project. The goal of this research was to help gather more accurate inputs from EEG, through an optimization study, and to increase the reliability of EEG. And by doing so, hopefully improve safety systems in cars, that in turn could help preventing sleepiness-related accidents on roads in the future. This was realized through a study of features, and feature selection algorithms. By determining key features that could distinguish sleepiness from a signal, as well as performing accuracy tests for different feature selection algorithms, the motivation for an optimal selection, based on the used parameters, could be made. However limited this research was, it concluded that Information Gain as a method for selecting features, was the most accurate algorithm, and that some features were better to use then others, such as Huguchi's fractal dimension, and the Hjorth complexity...|$|R

From his breast, from his mouth, sprang the endless space, and it was there behind him, everywhere. The people hurrying along the streets offered no obstruction to the void in which he found himself. They were small shadows whose footsteps and voices could be heard, but in each of them the same night, the same silence. He got off the car. In the country all was dead still. Little stars shone high up; little stars spread far away in the flood-waters, a firmament below. Everywhere the vastness and terror of the immense night which is roused and stirred for a brief while by the day, but which returns, and will remain at last eternal, holding everything in its silence and its living gloom. There was no Time, only Space. Who could say his mother had lived and did not live? She had been in one place, and was in another; that was all. And his soul could not leave her, wherever she was.

On every side the immense dark silence seemed pressing him, so tiny a spark, into extinction, and yet, almost nothing, he could not be extinct. Night, in which everything was lost, went reaching out, beyond stars and sun.

A 2006 article from The Economist magazine featured remarks from managing director Frederic Rouzaud about whether the brands identification with rap stars could affect their company negatively. His answer was dismissive: [...] "Thats a good question, but what can we do? We cant forbid people from buying it. Im sure Dom Pérignon or Krug champagne would be delighted to have their business." [...] In retaliation, many hip hop icons such as Jay-Z and Sean Combs, who previously included references to [...] "Cris", ceased all mentions and purchases of the champagne. 50 Cents deal with Vitamin Water, Dr. Dres promotion of his Beats by Dr. Dre headphone line and Dr. Pepper, and Drakes commercial with Sprite are successful deals. Although product placement deals were not popular in the 1980s, MC Hammer was an early innovator in this type of strategy. With merchandise such as dolls, commercials for soft drinks and numerous television show appearances, Hammer began the trend of rap artists being accepted as mainstream pitchpeople for brands.|$|R
