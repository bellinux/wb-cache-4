25|$|Deployment of divers from {{a surface}} {{saturation}} complex requires the diver {{to be transferred}} {{under pressure from the}} accommodation area to the underwater workplace.

The lock doors can then be opened for the divers to enter the bell. The divers will <b>suit</b> <b>up</b> before entering the bell and complete the pre-dive checks. The pressure in the bell will be adjusted to suit the depth at which the divers will lock out while the bell is being lowered, so that the pressure change can be slow without unduly delaying operations.|$|E
