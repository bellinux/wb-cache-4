5000|$|The <b>second</b> <b>freedom</b> allows [...] {{without the}} embarking or {{disembarking}} of passengers or cargo. It {{is the right}} to stop in one country solely for refueling or other maintenance on the way to another country. Because of longer range of modern airliners, <b>second</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> are comparatively rarely exercised by passenger carriers today, but they are widely used by air cargo carriers, and are more or less universal between countries.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first and}} <b>second</b> <b>freedoms</b> grant <b>rights</b> {{to pass through}} a country without {{carrying}} traffic that originates or terminates there and are known as 'transit rights'. The Chicago Convention drew up a multilateral agreement in which the first two freedoms, known as the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA) or [...] "Two Freedoms Agreement", were open to all signatories. As of mid-2007, the treaty was accepted by 129 countries.|$|R
50|$|Fifth <b>freedom</b> traffic <b>rights</b> are {{sought by}} {{airlines}} wishing {{to take up}} unserved or underserved routes, or by airlines whose flights already make technical stops at a location as allowed by the <b>second</b> <b>freedom.</b> Governments (e.g. Thailand) may sometimes encourage fifth freedom traffic {{as a way of}} promoting tourism, by increasing the number of seats available. In turn, though, there may be reactionary pressure to avoid liberalizing traffic rights too much in order to protect a flag carrier's commercial interests. By the 1990s, fifth <b>freedom</b> traffic <b>rights</b> stirred controversy in Asia because of loss-making services by airlines in the countries hosting them. Particularly in protest over US air carriers' service patterns in Asia, some nations have become less generous with regard to granting fifth <b>freedom</b> traffic <b>rights,</b> while sixth <b>freedom</b> traffic has grown in importance for Asian airlines.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>freedom</b> is the <b>right</b> to {{fly over}} a foreign country without landing. It grants the {{privilege}} {{to fly over}} the territory of a treaty country without landing. Member states of the International Air Services Transit Agreement grant this freedom (as well as the <b>second</b> <b>freedom)</b> to other member states, subject to the transiting aircraft using designated air routes. As of the summer of 2007, 129 countries were parties to this treaty, including such large ones as the United States of America, India, and Australia. However, Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, and China never joined, and Canada left the treaty in 1988. These large and strategically located non-IASTA-member states prefer to maintain tighter control over foreign airlines' overflight of their airspace, and negotiate transit agreements with other countries on a case-by-case basis. Since {{the end of the}} Cold War, first <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> are almost completely universal. Most countries require prior notification before an overflight, and may charge substantial fees for the privilege.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights,</b> {{the nature of the}} rights to human dignity, to life, and not to be discriminated against, or the right to a fair trial, does not permit them to be waived: “Unlike the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights,</b> these rights cannot be exercised negatively.” The <b>right</b> to <b>freedom</b> of expression, for example, can be exercised by keeping quiet, but the right to dignity cannot be exercised by being abused. One cannot therefore assume that the right is exercised when it is waived (as one can, subject to the above considerations, with the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights).</b>|$|R
50|$|Beyond rights {{allow the}} {{carriage}} of traffic between (and sometimes within) {{countries that are}} foreign to the airlines that operate them. Today, the most controversial of these are fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b> Less controversial but still restricted at times, though relatively more common are sixth <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{demonstrates}} that socioeconomic development, emancipative cultural change and democratization constitute a coherent syndrome of social progress – a syndrome whose common focus {{has not been}} properly specified by classical modernization theory. We specify this syndrome as ‘human development’, arguing that its three components have a common focus on broadening human choice. Socioeconomic development gives people the objective means of choice by increasing individual resources; rising emancipative values strengthen people’s subjective orientation towards choice; and democratization provides legal guarantees of choice by institutionalizing <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b> Analysis of data from the World Values Surveys {{demonstrates that}} the linkage between individual resources, emancipative values and <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> is universal in its presence across nations, regions and cultural zones; that this human development syndrome is shaped by a causal effect of individual resources and emancipative values on freedom rights; and that this effect operates through its impact on elite integrity, as the factor which makes <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> effective...|$|R
