The city adopted a commission-council form of government in 1911 {{with the opening of}} new City Hall and a council–manager government in 1954 before returning to an aldermanic form of government in 1959. Since January 1, 1997, Missoula has been governed in accordance with the Missoula City Charter, which calls for a mayor-council <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Rhodesian Prime Minister {{acted as}} Head of His or Her Majesty's Rhodesian Government, under the largely {{symbolic}} supervision of a British colonial Governor, until Rhodesia issued its unrecognised Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965. British-appointed {{figures such as}} the Governor were thereafter ignored by Salisbury. The unrecognised state's <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> however, remained otherwise unchanged, right down to its declared loyalty to Elizabeth II, which Britain did not acknowledge. This situation remained until March 1970, when Rhodesia adopted a republican <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> In republican Rhodesia, the Prime Minister instead nominally reported to the President.|$|E

50|$|Feudal {{maintenance}} under feudal <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> was {{the money}} payment to soldiers {{who fought in}} the interest and at the command of their lord.

5|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Republic, the {{authority}} of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> established by Augustus, known as the Principate. The Principate allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic. Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy, and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a de facto monarch.|$|E
5|$|The war of 1918 led to {{disintegration}} within both socialist and the non-socialist factions. The power political {{shift toward}} the right caused a dispute between conservatives and liberals {{on the best}} <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> for Finland to adopt: the former demanded monarchy and restricted parliamentarianism, the latter demanded a Finnish republic with full-scale democracy and social reforms. Both sides justified their views via political and legal grounds.|$|E

Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of planned liberalism, prioritising cash crops and petroleum development. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.|$|E

5|$|Qin Shi Huang, {{the first}} {{ruler of the}} Qin dynasty, {{established}} China's imperial <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in 221 BC after unifying the Seven Warring States through conquest, bringing to an end the Warring States period. For a time, the rulers of the warring states claimed nominal allegiance to an overlord king of the Zhou dynasty (c. 1050 – 256 BC), yet the Zhou kings' political power and prestige was {{less than that of}} later Chinese emperors. The imperial system fell apart after the fall of Qin in 206 BC. However, following Han's victory over Chu, the King of Han reestablished the imperial system and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu (r. 202–195 BC).|$|E

The civil war of 69 had made it abundantly clear that real power in the Empire lay with control over the army. By the time Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in Rome, any hope of restoring the Republic had long dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Singapore {{inherited}} a Westminster <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> from the British.

The head of state, who is the President of Singapore, {{is a member of}} both the executive Government of Singapore and the Parliament of Singapore but plays a minimal role in them. Executive power lies {{in the hands of the}} Cabinet, which is made up of the Prime Minister of Singapore (the head of government) and other Ministers. At the same time, the Prime Minister and Ministers are also Members of Parliament (MPs).|$|E

5|$|The {{period of}} Dutch rule saw growing hostility between the Catholic Belgian provinces and the {{predominantly}} Protestant Dutch. The Belgian provinces also {{complained that they}} were underrepresented by the Kingdom's <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> where 55 Belgian deputies were allocated to represent 3.5million people, while {{an equal number of}} Dutch deputies represented just two million. When the States-General voted against adopting the new unrepresentative constitution, William declared that the minority favorable vote outweighed the negative vote. Liberals in Belgium also accused William of attacking personal and religious freedoms.|$|E

5|$|Zimbabwe is a {{republic}} with a presidential <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> The semi-presidential system was abolished with {{the adoption of}} a new constitution after a referendum in March 2013. Under the constitutional changes in 2005, an upper chamber, the Senate, was reinstated. The House of Assembly is the lower chamber of Parliament. President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (commonly abbreviated ZANU-PF) has been the dominant political party in Zimbabwe since independence.|$|E

5|$|As Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) in Japan, MacArthur and {{his staff}} helped Japan rebuild itself, {{eradicate}} militarism and ultra-nationalism, promote political civil liberties, institute democratic government, and chart a new course that ultimately made Japan one of the world's leading industrial powers. The U.S. was firmly in control of Japan to oversee its reconstruction, and MacArthur was effectively the interim leader of Japan from 1945 until 1948. In 1946, MacArthur's staff drafted a new constitution that renounced war and stripped the Emperor of his military authority. The constitution—which became effective on 3 May 1947—instituted a parliamentary <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> under which the Emperor acted only {{on the advice of}} his ministers. It included the famous Article 9, which outlawed belligerency as an instrument of state policy and the maintenance of a standing army. The constitution also enfranchised women, guaranteed fundamental human rights, outlawed racial discrimination, strengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the police and local government.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fate}} of the Finns was decided outside Finland in Saint Petersburg on 15 March 1917, it was decided outside Finland again on 11 November 1918, in Berlin, after Germany {{accepted}} defeat in World War I. The German Empire collapsed in the German Revolution of 1918-19, caused by lack of food, war-weariness and defeat in the battles on the Western Front. Rüdiger von der Goltz and his squad left Helsinki on 16 December, and Prince Friedrich Karl, who had not yet been crowned, left his post on 20 December. Finland's status altered from a monarchist protectorate of the German Empire to an independent democratic republic, with a modernizing civil society. The <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> the primary Constitution of Finland, was confirmed on 17 July 1919.|$|E
5|$|By September 1767, all {{but four}} Jesuits {{had left the}} Chiquitania, and they went the {{following}} April. The Spanish considered it essential to maintain the settlements as a buffer against Portuguese expansion. The archbishop of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Francisco Ramón Herboso, established a new <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> {{very similar to that}} set up by the Jesuits. He stipulated that each mission be run by two secular (parish) priests, one {{to take care of the}} spiritual needs while the other was in charge of all other – political and economic – affairs of the mission administration. One change was that the Indians were allowed to trade. In practice, the shortage of clergy and the low quality of those appointed by the bishop – almost all of whom did not speak the language of the local peoples and in some cases had not been ordained – led to a rapid general decline of the missions. The priests also broke ethical and religious codes, appropriated the major part of the missions' income and encouraged contraband trade with the Portuguese.|$|E
