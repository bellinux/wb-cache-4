Sir Angus Grossart, Sir David Murray, Ann Gloag, Brian Souter, Sir Tom Farmer and Ewan Brown each provided £1 million. Soutar stated that [...] "Airdrie Savings Bank represents what Scottish banks once stood for - security of funds, a focus on <b>savings</b> and <b>outstanding</b> personal service". He went on to say that: [...] "We believe the mutual principle is fundamental to the integrity of the bank. We are doing this because so many Scots are dismayed at what has happened within the banking sector".|$|R

30|$|As {{we discuss}} {{later in the}} paper, in the second {{proposed}} approach, by setting a simple relation between the increase and decrease step sizes, but letting them to change from one time slot to another, {{we are able to}} simplify the optimization problem yet surprisingly further improve the energy saving. Numerical results show that our proposed schemes significantly improve the energy efficiency of the network by reducing the average number of transmissions per time slot. In some cases, the reported energy <b>saving</b> reaches an <b>outstanding</b> value of 20 % when a variable step size is used. It is worth mentioning that our proposed approaches are distributed and such performance improvement is achieved without extra cost of central monitoring or hand shaking between the users and the base station (BS).|$|R

40|$|An {{effective}} {{computational framework}} for homogenization and microcracking analysis of polycrystalline RVEs is presented. The method {{is based on}} a recently developed grain-boundary formulation for polycrystalline materials and several enhancements over the original technique are introduced to reduce the computational effort needed to model three-dimensional polycrystalline aggregates, which is highly desirable, especially in a multiscale perspective. First, a regularization scheme is used to remove pathological entities, usually responsible for unduly large mesh refinements, from Voronoi polycrystalline morphologies. Second, an improved meshing strategy is used, with an aim towards meshing robustness, a requirement often challenged by the inherent high statistical variability of Voronoi tessellations. Additionally, for homogenization purposes, the use of periodic non-prismatic polycrystalline RVEs is proposed {{as an alternative to the}} classical prismatic RVEs, generally employed in the literature. The proposed overall scheme promotes a remarkable reduction in the number of DoFs of the problem in hand, and thus <b>outstanding</b> <b>savings</b> in terms of computational time and memory storage. Furthermore, the smoother meshing strategy, combined with a Newton-Raphson method, enhances the convergence of the microcracking algorithm...|$|R

Nowadays, {{there are}} some {{questions}} to be solved in the northern parts of China where spread {{a large number of}} residential buildings such as loss of energy and lack of living comfort. Combined with identical features of the residential buildings and referred to the different envelop enclosure, we put forward the strategy of transformation on existing residential buildings for energy saving. In addition, we put the emphasis on the detailed construction design to improve the quality and comfort of old buildings to fulfill sustainable development based on the reduced loss of energy. Put forward the Question At present, people {{pay more attention to the}} shortage of energy resources. The north residential building of China is waste seriously because of the lack of technical energy efficiency. Compared to the developed countries with similar climate, we wasted more than twice. Questions about the transformation on residential buildings for energy <b>saving</b> have been <b>outstanding.</b> It is a great challenge that how to bring about sustainable and how to improve the quality of life based on the satisfying energy efficiency.

40|$|The {{staff report}} for the {{combined}} 2005 Article IV Consultation on Burkina Faso focuses on recent economic developments and performance. Burkina Faso has maintained an average real GDP growth {{rate of more than}} 6 percent annually, and inflation has been contained. Revenues performance is benefiting from the computerization of the major customs offices and the introduction of a new single taxpayer identification number. Continued implementation of pro-growth macroeconomic policies, diversification of the economy, and structural reforms will be necessary to establish the conditions for a resumption of robust economic growth.

40|$|Powder {{metallurgy}} is a {{net shape}} manufacturing approach, {{which is very}} attractive because {{of its ability to}} form powders directly into finished components. These components are formed in an economical manner having a considerable choice in material properties, mechanical, chemical and microstructure control. The chemical composition of powder blends and their consolidation are characterized producing a full fine pearlitic structure during the sintering process which is important to maintain tensile strength and size control. Changes in dimensions of metal powder compacts do occur during the production process. The ability to control the changes {{is an important part of}} the manufacturing process. The <b>outstanding</b> <b>savings</b> achieved through the production of near net shape is the driving force behind this manufacturing process. Size change of the material must be known and it is one of the most important functions when designing compaction dies for new components. In this paper, an overview of the effect of Dimensional change (Growth) during sintering when compared to the two atomized pre alloyed grades of ferrous powders was investigated. Density, spring back, dimensional change were determined in the green and sintered conditions. Densities in the range of 6. 0 – 6. 6 g/cm 3 were achieved by withdrawal die motion and sintering temperature of 1100 °C, 1110 °C and at 1120 °C were utilized. Sintering temperature, green density and � 0 of carbon content were found to be the most significant variable controlling dimensional change...|$|R
