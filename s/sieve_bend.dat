40|$|This report {{covers the}} {{technical}} progress achieved from July 01, 1997 to September 30, 1997 on the POC-Scale Testing Agglomeration Techniques and Equipment for Fine Coal Processing project. Experimental procedures and test data for recovery of fine coal from coal fines streams generated at a commercial {{coal preparation plant}} are described. Two coal fines streams, namely <b>Sieve</b> <b>Bend</b> Effluent and Cyclone Overflow were investigated. The test results showed that ash was reduced by more than 50 % at combustible matter recovery levels exceeding 95 %...|$|E
40|$|Several {{sampling}} {{techniques were}} evaluated to recover representative core {{samples from the}} ash ponds at Western Kentucky Energy's Coleman Station. The most successful {{was a combination of}} continuous-flight augers and specially designed soft-sediment sampling tubes driven by a Hammerhead drill mounted on an amphibious ARGO vehicle. A total of 51 core samples were recovered and analyzed in 3 ft sections and it was determined that there are 1, 354, 974 tons of ash in Pond C. Of the over 1. 35 M tons of ash present, 14 % or 190 K tons can be considered as coarse (+ 100 mesh). Pond C contains approximately 88 K tons of carbon, nearly half of which is coarse and potentially recoverable with spiral concentration while the fine carbon (- 100 mesh) is recoverable with froth flotation. There are 1. 27 M tons of carbon-free ash, 12 % of which is coarse and potentially usable as block sand. Spiral concentration testing on bulk samples showed that product grade of 30 to 38 % C (4200 to 5500 Btu/lb) was obtainable. When this product was cleaned again in an additional stage of spiral concentration, the product grade was improved to 7200 to 8200 Btu/lb with an accompanying 13 to 29 % decrease in yield. Release analysis of hydraulically classified pond ash showed that froth flotation could provide froth products with as high a grade as 9000 Btu/lb with a yield of 5 %. Increasing yield to 10 % reduced froth grade to 7000 Btu/lb. Batch flotation provided froth grades as high as 6500 Btu/lb with yields of 7 % with 1. 5 lb/ton SPP and 1 lb/ton frother. Column flotation test results were similar to those achieved in batch flotation in terms of both grade and yield, however, carbon recoveries were lower ( 50 % carbon recovery and using wash water improved froth grade. Bottom ash samples were recovered from each of the units at Coleman Station. Characterization confirmed that sufficient quantity and quality of material is generated to produce a marketable lightweight aggregate and recover a high-grade fuel product. Spiral concentration provided acceptable grade lightweight aggregate with yields of only 10 to 20 %. Incorporating a <b>sieve</b> <b>bend</b> into the process to recover coarse, porous ash particles from the outside race of the spirals increased aggregate yield to as high as 75 %, however, the carbon content of the aggregate also increased. An opening size of 28 mesh on the <b>sieve</b> <b>bend</b> appeared to be sufficient. Lightweight concrete blocks (28 to 32 lbs) were produced from bottom ash and results show that acceptable strength could be attained with a cement/concrete ratio as low as 1 / 4. A mobile Proof-of-Concept (POC) field unit was designed and fabricated to meet the processing objectives of the project. The POC plant consisted of two trailer-mounted modules and was completely self sufficient with respect to power and water requirements. The POC unit was hauled to Coleman Station and operated at a feed rate of 2 tph. Results showed that the spirals operated similarly to previous pilot-scale operations and a 500 lb composite sample of coarse carbon was collected with a grade of 51. 7 % C or 7279 Btu/lb. Flotation results compared favorably with release analysis and 500 lbs of composite froth product was collected with a grade of 35 % C or 4925 Btu/lb. The froth product was dewatered to 39 % moisture with vacuum filtration. Pan pelletization and briquetting were evaluated as a means of minimizing handling concerns. Rotary pan pelletization produced uniform pellets with a compressive strength of 4 lbf without the use of any binder. Briquettes were produced by blending the coarse and fine carbon products at a ratio of 1 : 10, which is the proportion that the two products would be produced in a commercial operation. Using 3 % lime as a binder produced the most desirable briquettes with respect to strength, attrition and drop testing. Additionally, the POC carbon products compared favorably with commercial activated carbon when used for removal of mercury from simulated flue gas. A business model was generated to summarize anticipated costs incurred {{during the first year of}} operation of a 50 tph feed capacity plant. Using the best available data from a variety of sources, the business model showed that even when using conservative pricing and sales volume, the processing plant would be economically viable in the first year of operation. Not surprisingly, economic success would be sensitive to sales volume and pricing. In order to maximize both of these factors, it is imperative that high quality products be produced...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} {{objective of this}} research project is to assess the potential process efficiency and pollution control benefits that may occur by applying the hydrothermal, or hot water-drying, process to low-rank coals as related to entrained-flow gasification systems. Project emphasis is on identifying more efficient coal dewatering and CWF formulation methods prior to gasification. A favorable estimate of incremental cost for integrated hydrothermal drying depends, in part, on increasing the particle size of the feed coal from minus 100 to minus 28 mesh {{for the purpose of}} simplifying the slurry concentration process. Two options will be reviewed for dewatering or concentrating the processed slurry: (1) repressurization and then concentration with <b>sieve</b> <b>bends</b> or (2) partial dewatering at system pressure with hydroclones. Both have their own merits, <b>sieve</b> <b>bends</b> being a low-cost alternative, while hydroclone application would not require additional pumping sections prior to gasification. Various CWF samples with different particle-size distributions and solids concentrations will be sent to equipment vendors for application review. Also, EERC cost models will be used to calculate the integral cost of adding the partial dewatering to the hydrothermal technology for a commercial-size facility...|$|R
40|$|Equipment wear is a {{major concern}} in the mineral {{processing}} industry, which dramatically increases the maintenance cost and adversely affects plant operation efficiency. In this research, wear problems of mineral processing equipment including screens, <b>sieve</b> <b>bends,</b> heavy media vessel, dewatering centrifuge, etc., were identified. A novel surface treatment technology, high density infrared (HDI) surface coating process was proposed for the surface enhancement of selected mineral processing equipment. Microstructural and mechanical properties of the coated samples were characterized. Laboratory-simulated wear tests were conducted to evaluate the tribological performance of the coated components. Test results indicate that the wear resistance of AISI 4140 and ASTM A 36 steels can be increased 3 and 5 folds, respectively by the application of HDI coatings...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the continuing problem of {{noise induced hearing loss}} NIHL among mine workers, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has conducted numerous noise surveys in coal preparation plants. The research, consisting of worker dose monitoring, task observations, and equipment noise profiling, was completed in eight separate preparation plants. Worker dose monitoring was conducted for three shifts in most cases. Workers experiencing higher than allowable doses were task-observed for one full shift to correlate dose to noise source(s). Finally, noise levels on all floors, and in lunchrooms and control rooms, were characterized. Results indicate that only workers who routinely spend a significant portion of their shift in the plants (away from the control rooms) are susceptible to overexposure from noise. Certain pieces of equipment (screens, centrifuges, <b>sieve</b> <b>bends)</b> are the loudest primary noise sources responsible for the worker noise exposures...|$|R
