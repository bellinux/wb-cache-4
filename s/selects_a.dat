The game contains fifty-five offensive plays and seventy-one defensive plays, such as screen and play-action passes, blitzes and man-to-man defense. During a down, the player may control one team member {{at a time}} or allow the entire team to execute a play automatically.

30|$|Each {{consumer}} household {{exists in}} a local neighborhood, buys products in local retail stores, and then uses those products. Buying products means <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> store and then <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> product from that store. Using products means <b>selecting</b> <b>an</b> item from inventory, reducing the stored amount of that item, and then updating the agent’s memory about the product usage experience. These processes are O((⌈[*]log 2 (N)⌉) {{in time and space}} for each agent.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, another immigrant, Hsin, {{tends to}} his leukemia-stricken daughter, Kim.

5|$|Once a male {{has found}} a mate, he <b>selects</b> <b>a</b> territory, marking the {{boundaries}} by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward {{in a series of}} loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{city council}} is {{composed}} of seven residents who are elected in at-large, non-partisan elections to four-year terms.

5|$|When {{decompression}} planning {{software is}} used to produce a schedule for a planned dive, the necessary input includes a definition of the dive profile. This may be in as much detail as the user is prepared to provide and the program is capable of using, but will always specify at least maximum depth and bottom time, and may go into detail regarding recent dive history, multiple levels, gas switches, altitude and personal conservatism factors. Many dive computers have a dive planning function for which the diver <b>selects</b> <b>a</b> maximum depth and the computer displays the maximum bottom time for which no decompression stops are required.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} related to battles is demon negotiation, {{the process by}} which new demons are invited to join the Protagonist and can fight {{alongside}} them. The majority of demons can be talked to in battle by the Protagonist, and some allied demons. After selecting the option to talk, the player <b>selects</b> <b>a</b> demon, which initiates a negotiation. For those demons who can talk, the responses vary by both situation and a demon's temperament: some demons can be bribed with Macca and items, some will ask questions related to subjects like philosophy, while others can be influenced by the Protagonist's skills of flattery or eloquence. A negotiation can fail if the wrong responses are chosen, if the Protagonist's demon roster is full, or if another enemy demon interrupts. When in the party, demons can be summoned or dismissed from battle. The level of assigned Magatama can also affect how negotiation goes.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited II is {{a flight}} {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. The interactive cockpit of each plane {{is based on}} its real-world counterpart, and it contains simulated flight instruments such as an airspeed indicator, a heading indicator and a VOR indicator, among others. The player begins by engaging in a Quick Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. In a Quick Flight, the player <b>selects</b> <b>a</b> plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and taxiing. Adventures are pre-built missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total.|$|E

5|$|In {{the event}} of an absence, disability, or other cause {{preventing}} the mayor from performing his duties, the mayor may designate the business administrator or any other department head as acting mayor for up to 60 days. In {{the event of}} a vacancy in the office, the President of the City Council becomes acting mayor, and the council has 30 days to name an interim mayor. If no interim mayor is named, the Council President continues as acting mayor until a successor is elected, or the council reorganizes and <b>selects</b> <b>a</b> new President. Prior to 1971, there was no automatic succession law. The office was left vacant for 47 days in 1963 when the City Council failed to reach a decision on appointing an interim mayor.|$|E
5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes is {{the third}} entry in the Marvel vs. Capcom series of 2D {{fighting}} games. The game utilizes similar tag team-based game mechanics to its predecessor, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter. Before starting each match, the player <b>selects</b> <b>a</b> team of two fighters to compete in one-on-one combat. The player is free to swap between their characters at any point during battle. While one character fights, their teammate resting off-screen slowly regenerates their life gauge. The first team to exhaust their opponent's vitality wins the match; however, if the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|The male <b>selects</b> <b>a</b> territory, {{which he}} defends against conspecifics, and re-establishes a pair bond with his mate or attracts a new female if necessary. Courtship {{involves}} ritualised flight and ground displays, {{and the male}} often presents a fish to his partner. Most species {{have little or no}} nest, laying the eggs onto bare ground, but Trudeau's tern, Forster's tern and the marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats. Black and lesser noddies build nests of twigs, feathers and excreta on tree branches, and brown, blue, and grey noddies make rough platforms of grass and seaweed on cliff ledges, in cavities or on other rocky surfaces. The Inca tern nests in crevices, caves and disused burrows, such as that of a Humboldt penguin. The white tern is unique in that it lays its single egg on a bare tree branch.|$|E
50|$|The American Hockey Coaches Association (AHCA) selects All-Americans at the Division I and Division III levels, {{for both}} men and women.

For Division III men, they <b>select</b> <b>a</b> first- and a second-team for East and for West; for Division III women, they <b>select</b> <b>a</b> first and second team for both East and West.|$|R
30|$|DALP-TS {{utilizes}} two counters (both initialized to zero) in {{the neighborhood}} selection process: non-improving move count and minor improving move count. DALP-TS increments the non-improving move count value after <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> non-improving move and resets the value to zero after selecting either type of improving move. Likewise, DALP-TS increments the minor improving move count value after <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> minor improving move and resets the value to zero after <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> major improving move; however, after <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> non-improving move, the minor improving move count does not change. This logic prevents DALP-TS from indefinitely cycling between non-improving and minor improving moves. DALP-TS halts when either of these counters reach a predetermined cessation value (maximum value).|$|R
50|$|Knuth {{observed}} that a naive implementation of his Algorithm X would spend {{an inordinate amount}} of time searching for 1s. When <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> column, the entire matrix had to be searched for 1s. When <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> row, an entire column had to be searched for 1s. After <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> row, that row and a number of columns had to be searched for 1s. To improve this search time from complexity O(n) to O(1), Knuth implemented a sparse matrix where only 1s are stored.|$|R
