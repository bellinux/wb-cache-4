[...] Scott Beatty felt [...] "Tommy Lee Jones played Harvey Dent as a Joker knock-off rather than a multi-layered rogue." [...] Lee Bermejo called Batman Forever [...] "unbearable". Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both gave the film mixed reviews, but with the former giving it a thumbs up and the latter a thumbs down. In his written review, Ebert wrote: [...] "Is the movie better entertainment? Well, it's great bubblegum for the eyes. Younger children will be able to process it more easily; <b>some</b> <b>kids</b> were led bawling from Batman Returns where the PG-13 rating was a joke."

500|$|Beginning in April 2008, {{the media}} {{reported}} growing speculation that Chris Matthews, news commentator {{and host of}} MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, might run in the 2010 Democratic primary for the United States Senate Pennsylvania seat then occupied by the Republican Arlen Specter. In an interview with The New York Times Magazine, Matthews said that he believed Specter {{had been in the}} Senate for too long, but that running for Senate would mean giving up a career he loved. Mark Leibovich, author of the article, wrote, [...] "Matthews has been particularly obsessed with Pennsylvania of late, devoting hours on and off the air to the state's upcoming Democratic primary, staying in close contact with the state's party apparatus". Speculation was further fueled by Matthews' appearance on an April 14 episode of The Colbert Report. Host Stephen Colbert asked Matthews about the rumors and prodded him to make a public announcement, to which Matthews replied, [...] "Did you ever want to be something your whole life? ... When you grow up, <b>some</b> <b>kids</b> want to be a fireman. I want to be a Senator. But I have to deal with these things as they come." [...] Matthews declined to directly answer questions about his possible candidacy when pressed by the media, but did not deny the possibility.|$|E
500|$|Chelsea manager Mourinho was {{primarily}} concerned with the fitness of his squad {{in the aftermath of}} the match, in particular Ballack, who was substituted with an injury early in the match: [...] "He had a kick in the muscle and he couldn't run but I hope he will be back soon, we have quite a few players not in condition and we need players back, so I hope it's not a big deal." [...] He felt that the fitness of the two squads was the decisive factor in the match: [...] "Today our bench was not very good, with <b>some</b> <b>kids,</b> Liverpool could inject fresh blood at the same time as some of my players became really tired. They were broken. They were in better condition than us, you could see the difference between Frank Lampard and Sissoko." [...] Mourinho was also unconcerned about his team's form heading into the start of the season: [...] "Liverpool had more intensity and pace, qualities that make a team better. They had that and we didn't. We had a big percentage of the ball possession, but Liverpool defended with intensity and looked dangerous when they counter-attacked. I keep saying they are a difficult team to beat and they can go to every game with an ambition to win. They are a good team but over 10 months of competition we will be there." ...|$|E

[...] "I mean, at least it means that people are excited to hear our stuff." [...] "No, It Isn't" [...] leaked in December 2005 and caused speculation as it addressed the break-up of Blink-182 head-on. Hoppus did not give any formal interviews before shortly prior to the release of the album, instead spending time updating his blog, producing tracks for Motion City Soundtrack, and working on the album in relative secrecy. [...] "During that time, their former bandmate, Tom DeLonge, did the opposite, peppering blogs and magazines with quotes hyping his new band and putting the blame for the Blink situation squarely on their shoulders," [...] reported James Montgomery of MTV News. While it [...] "pained" [...] them to do so, Hoppus and Barker refrained from speaking to media, instead burying themselves in the studio in the recording of the album. [...] "We just bit our tongues and didn't say anything, and now that the record is done, we get the chance to tell the truth about everything," [...] Hoppus said. [...] "We were silent for a year, and we couldn't put into words what we were doing, so we just decided not to say anything and let the music speak for itself," [...] Barker added.
