5|$|Being {{popular in}} Australia with players {{as well as}} the public, Sargent made three lengthy tours of Australia and New Zealand in 1936. He was on the point of {{accepting}} a permanent appointment with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation when, at the outbreak of the Second World War, he felt it his duty to return to his country, resisting strong pressure from the Australian media for him to stay. During the war, Sargent directed the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester (1939–42) and the Liverpool Philharmonic (1942–48) and became a popular BBC Home Service radio broadcaster. He helped boost public morale during the war by extensive concert tours around the country conducting for nominal fees. On one famous occasion, an air raid interrupted a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. Sargent stopped the orchestra, calmed the audience by saying they were safer inside the hall than fleeing outside, and resumed conducting. He later said that no orchestra had ever played <b>so</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> that no audience in his experience had ever listened so intently. In May 1941 Sargent conducted the last performance held in the Queen's Hall. Following an afternoon performance of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius, the hall was destroyed during a night-time incendiary raid.|$|E
25|$|Sterne's Writings, {{in which}} it is clearly shewn, that he, whose manner and style were so long thought original, was, in fact, the most unhesitating {{plagiarist}} who ever cribbed from his predecessors in order to garnish his own pages. It must be owned, at the same time, that Sterne selects the materials of his mosaic work with so much art, places them <b>so</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> polishes them so highly, that in most cases we are disposed to pardon the want of originality, in consideration of the exquisite talent with which the borrowed materials are wrought up into the new form.|$|E
25|$|The {{other great}} poet of the preclassical period was Hesiod. Unlike Homer, Hesiod speaks {{of himself in}} his poetry. Nonetheless, nothing is known about him from any {{external}} source. He {{was a native of}} Boeotia in central Greece, and is thought to have lived and worked around 700 BC. Hesiod's two extant poems are Works and Days and Theogony. Works and Days is a faithful depiction of the poverty-stricken country life he knew <b>so</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> it sets forth principles and rules for farmers. Theogony is a systematic account of creation and of the gods. It vividly describes the ages of mankind, beginning with a long-past Golden Age.|$|E

25|$|When {{writing the}} stories, {{he started with}} their twist endings, and then worked his way back from that. He {{designed}} {{the flow of the}} story by using a spreadsheet, and wrote prototypes of potential outcomes of the different scenarios in the game; after this, he matched it with the flowchart he had made, and came up with the details of each story. As he wrote each scene, he imagined what the player might be thinking as they play through it, and decided what to write based on it; {{this was one of the}} most important things to him when writing. A key element to Uchikoshi when writing the outcomes of player decisions is that the importance of the decision usually is much greater after the player has made it, with the consequences only being revealed later on as the player learns more information; this was to maintain the high suspense level, and to avoid situations where choices end up not actually mattering. One big challenge for him was to maintain player interest through all branches; he tried to have each branch develop differently, as to avoid repetition and fatigue, and keep the player motivated. While he came up with the set-up, the setting, and the characters on his own, he had a sub-writer helping him with writing the second game, and two sub-writers for the third game. They would help with brainstorming ideas and finding what does not work <b>so</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> how to improve scenarios.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the end of}} 1983, Phil Lynott {{formed a}} new band called Grand Slam, but they {{were never able to}} secure a {{contract}} with a record company and split by the beginning of 1985. Sykes and Downey initially agreed {{to be a part of}} the band, but Sykes joined Whitesnake and Downey also changed his mind. Lynott began to focus more on his solo career and enjoyed a no. 5 hit single [...] "Out in the Fields" [...] with Gary Moore in May 1985. The song, composed by Moore, was taken from his solo album Run for Cover featuring various contributions from Lynott. Lynott's solo efforts did not fare <b>so</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> his last single, [...] "Nineteen", only reached no. 76 in the UK.|$|E

William York of Allmusic thought the band [...] "doesn't really add {{anything}} {{new to the}} mix from a musical standpoint" [...] with the release, while also praising it for being [...] "solid enough and well executed" [...] with [...] "adequate" [...] production. Sherwin Frias of Jesus Freak Hideout had similar sentiments and commented [...] "As I Lay Dying didn't exactly break many boundaries in making this record", but praised that each song is [...] "executed <b>so</b> <b>well</b> (<b>and</b> with such precision) that nary a song misses its target."

[...] "A Shortstop in China" [...] premiered on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network on May 8, 2009, chronicling Ripken's trip to China to share the game of baseball with youth and coaches while nurturing American-Chinese diplomacy. The documentary included footage from the 11 clinics Cal and former Oriole B.J. Surhoff held from Beijing to Guangzhou. The documentary also showed Ripken accepting his appointment from Rice and featured a variety of interviews, from Ripken's wife Kelly to former Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, Karen Hughes.|$|E

Pfeiffer {{played the role of}} aging retired courtesan Léa de Lonval, opposite Rupert Friend in the title role, with Kathy Bates as his mother. Chéri premiered at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival, where it received a nomination for the Golden Bear award. The Times of London reviewed the film favorably, describing Hampton's screenplay as a [...] "steady flow of dry quips and acerbic one-liners" [...] and Pfeiffer's performance as [...] "magnetic and subtle, her worldly nonchalance a mask for vulnerability and heartache". Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that it was [...] "fascinating to observe how Pfeiffer controls her face and voice during times of painful hurt". Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times praised the [...] "wordless scenes that catch Léa unawares, with the camera alone seeing the despair and regret that she hides from the world.

Shane Crawford, the 1999 Brownlow Medallist, noted he had improved that year and showed enough glimpses to predict he would be a top ten player in the competition in the next few years. A club post-season trip to China saw Watts play in an exhibition match against Brisbane known as the Shanghai Showdown; played at Jiangwan Stadium, Melbourne won the match by five points.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} {{originally}} drew {{her to the}} role of Terri in an interview with TheTVChick, Gilsig said: [...] "Well, first of all, Ryan Murphy.

He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for many years now and also if I was going to do that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know <b>so</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E

Things did not work out as planned, and three weeks later Rasmussen became available after Ulrich gave him a call. Rasmussen listened to Clink's rough mixes for the album on his February 14 flight to Los Angeles, and upon his arrival Clink was fired. Hetfield explained that recording with Clink did not work out <b>so</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> Rasmussen came over as a last-minute replacement.
