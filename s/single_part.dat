5|$|The {{project was}} {{designed}} {{with a new}} methodology called fault tree analysis, which allowed {{the effects of a}} failure of a <b>single</b> <b>part</b> to be studied to determine its impact on other systems. To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant hydraulic systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces. Additionally, some of the most advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included slats running almost {{the entire length of the}} wing, as well as complex three-part slotted flaps along the trailing edge of the wing. The wing's complex three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.|$|E

He began playing guitar at age nine, learning to play from his mother's younger brother. As a teenager, he formed bands with schoolmates and started performing concerts under names such as The Juniors and the Strangers. They also appeared on television and put out a <b>single.</b> <b>Part</b> of the band was recruited for a new group called The Gods, which included Ken Hensley (later of Uriah Heep fame).

25|$|Polysomnography is {{performed}} in a sleep laboratory while the patient sleeps, preferably {{at his or her}} usual sleeping time. The polysomnogram (PSG) objectively records sleep stages and respiratory events. It shows multiple channels of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), nasal and oral airflow, abdominal, chest and leg movements and blood oxygen levels. A <b>single</b> <b>part</b> of a polysomnogram is sometimes measured at home with portable equipment, for example oximetry, which records blood oxygen levels throughout the night. Polysomnography is not routinely used in the evaluation of patients with insomnia or circadian rhythm disorders, except as needed to rule out other disorders. It will usually be a definitive test for sleep apnea.|$|E
25|$|The RWD 7 was {{a wooden}} construction, {{conventional}} in layout, high-wing cantilever monoplane. The fuselage was rectangular in cross-section (narrowing in upper part), plywood-covered, {{apart from the}} engine section, which was aluminium sheet-covered. The wings were trapezoid, single-spar, <b>single</b> <b>part,</b> canvas and plywood covered. A crew of two was sitting in tandem, with a pilot in the rear cab. The crew cabs were open on upper sides, and had doors on the right side. The engine was 5-cylinder Armstrong Siddeley Genet II radial engine, 56kW (75hp) nominal power. Two-blade wooden propeller of a fixed pitch. The plane had a conventional landing gear, with a rear skid. A 30 l fuel tank was in central part of wing. A cruise fuel consumption was 18 l/hour.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{prediction}} {{of the theory}} is the extreme porosity of matter. As supposed by Fatio and Le Sage in 1690/1758 (and before them, Huygens) matter must consist mostly of empty space so that the very small particles can penetrate the bodies nearly undisturbed and therefore every <b>single</b> <b>part</b> of matter can {{take part in the}} gravitational interaction. This prediction has been (in some respects) confirmed {{over the course of the}} time. Indeed, matter consists mostly of empty space and certain particles like neutrinos can pass through matter nearly unhindered. However, the image of elementary particles as classical entities who interact directly, determined by their shapes and sizes (in the sense of the net structure proposed by Fatio/Le Sage and the equisized spheres of Isenkrahe/Darwin), is not consistent with current understanding of elementary particles. The Lorentz/Thomson proposal of electrical charged particles as the basic constituents of matter is inconsistent with current physics as well.|$|E

The type specimens numbered UCCIPR L-18 F-749 and UCCIPR L-18 F-750 for the part and counterpart is currently preserved in the palaeoentomology collections housed at Thompson Rivers University, in Kamloops, British Columbia. Archibald, Cover, and Moreau coined the specific epithet from the Latin [...] "orbiculatus", [...] meaning [...] "rounded" [...] or [...] "circular", {{in reference to the}} shape of the head. The species is discernible from the other two species of Ypresiomyrma by its notably rounded head capsule, and by the shape of the petiole which has a smoothly sloping convex shape with a node in the center. The petiole is similar in appearance to Prionomyrmex janzeni, and the propodeum is round. The queen is estimated to have been approximately [...] The compound eyes are large and oval shape, but the antennae cannot be described due to poor preservation. The mandibles are large, containing seven to eight teeth. A well-developed stinger is also present.|$|E

Given {{the image of a}} face, five important parts (right and left eyes, nose, mouth and chin) are extracted and represented as appearance-based data vectors. In addition, the full face and its internal rectangular region (excluding hair, ears and contour) are also coded. Several mixtures of classifiers based on (subsets of) these five <b>single</b> <b>parts</b> were designed using simple voting, weighted voting and other learner as combiners.

Theoretically, the TF104 is an evolutionary step up from the TF103, but in fact, the TF104 shares not a <b>single</b> <b>part</b> that we used with the TF103. We improved every single inch of the chassis, and redesigned every important internal component. We achieved a great leap ahead aerodynamically, made the car lighter overall, and increased the rigidity of the chassis".|$|E

2500|$|Seventeenth-century {{philosopher and}} {{scientist}} René Descartes was highly interested in anatomy and physiology. He discussed the pineal gland both {{in his first}} book, the Treatise of Man (written before 1637, but only published posthumously 1662/1664), and in his last book, The Passions of the Soul (1649) and he regarded it as [...] "the principal seat of the soul and the place in which all our thoughts are formed." [...] In the Treatise of Man, Descartes described conceptual models of man, namely creatures created by God, which consist of two ingredients, a body and a soul. In the Passions, Descartes split man up into a body and a soul and emphasized that the soul is joined to the whole body by [...] "a certain very small gland situated {{in the middle of}} the brain's substance and suspended above the passage through which the spirits in the brain's anterior cavities communicate with those in its posterior cavities". Descartes attached significance to the gland because he believed it to be the only section of the brain to exist as a <b>single</b> <b>part</b> rather than one-half of a pair. Most of Descartes's basic anatomical and physiological assumptions were totally mistaken, not only by modern standards, but also in light of what was already known in his time.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the end of}} the War, Surendranath Banerjee, {{followed}} by Barin Ghose and Motilal Roy, successfully negotiated the withdrawal of warrants against the fugitives accused of the Indo-German plot. Atul was adamant in obtaining a promise on these points : (a) there would be no question of surrendering arms; (b) no questions would be raised on their past activities; (c) no parole would be demanded concerning their future conducts. Atul came out in 1921. But his Dada’s (Jatin Mukherjee’s) heroic death, [...] "had knocked out his revolutionary ardour and he gave up active politics." [...] Yet, in January 1924, when Gopinath Saha killed an Englishman, mistaking him to be Tegart, the much-hated Commissioner of Kolkata Police (reputed to have shot Jatin Mukherjee dead), Atul was made a state-prisoner, to be released in 1926. The same year he married Menokarani Rakshit of Majilpur, 24 Parganas and took to business, dissociating himself completely from politics. They had no issues. In an interview with Prithwindra Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin's grandson), on 27 October 1963 - shortly before his death -, Atul sighed: [...] "Dada was a magnet; we all, iron scraps, received our energy from him. When he was no more, we all became iron scraps. I still do not know whether my first allegiance went to Dada, or to the Motherland." [...] Asked about the source of Jatindranath's tremendous force, Atul replied: [...] "He was a very well trained wrestler and an all-round sportsman. But what characterised him was his soul force and his power of concentration. He could pin-point all his energy to a <b>single</b> <b>part</b> of his body, for instance his fist. A single blow from that fist was equivalent to an electric charge of God knows how many volts!" ...|$|E
