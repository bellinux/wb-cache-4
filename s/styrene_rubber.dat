40|$|This paper {{describes}} the experimental {{measurements of the}} elastic modulus and hardness of viscoelastic materials under quasi-static and dynamic depth-sensing indentation using a homemade tribology probe microscope (TPM). The indentation measurements were performed using a sapphire sphere tip under various conditions. Materials such as polytetrafluoroethylene, <b>styrene</b> <b>rubber</b> and nitrile rubber were tested in both quasi-static and dynamic experiments. In quasi-static mode, the loading and unloading force curves were obtained from these specimens, and the results show a significant load effect on the measured hardness and elastic modulus. The dynamic indentation tests were conducted under a range of loading forces with various frequencies. The values of storage modulus, loss modulus and damping factor were determined by dynamic indentation. To get an accurate measurement, the stiffness and damping of the instrument were rigorously analyzed. Using dynamic indentation, {{it was confirmed that}} the variation in the frequency of the oscillation force has a significant effect on the measured results of the materials. Comparing the results obtained from the quasi-static and dynamic indentations, for the viscoelastic properties, dynamic indentation offers an advantage over the quasi-static method. Collectively, these results clearly demonstrate the capability of our homemade TPM facility to determine the constitutive behavior of viscoelastic solids in the frequency domain...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate and compare the impact strength and transverse strength of the high-impact denture base materials. A conventional heat polymerized acrylic resin {{was used as a}} control. Materials and Methods: The entire experiment was divided into four main groups with twenty specimens each according to denture base material selected Trevalon, Trevalon Hi, DPI Tuff and Metrocryl Hi. These groups were further subgrouped into the two parameters selected, impact strength and flexural strength with ten specimens each. These specimens were then subjected to transverse bend tests with the help of Lloyds instrument using a three point bend principle. Impact tests were undertaken using an Izod-Charpy digital impact tester. Results: This study was analyzed with one-way analysis of variance using Fisher f-test and Bonferroni t-test. There was a significant improvement in the impact strength of high-impact denture base resins as compared to control (Trevalon). However, in terms of transverse bend tests, only DPI Tuff showed higher transverse strength in comparison to control. Trevalon Hi and Metrocryl Hi showed a decrease in transverse strength. Conclusions: Within the limits of this in vitro study, (1) There is a definite increase in impact strength due to the incorporation of butadiene <b>styrene</b> <b>rubber</b> in this high strength denture base materials as compared to Trevalon used as a control. (2) Further investigations are required to prevent the unduly decrease of transverse strength.

This paper {{presents the results}} of the study of physical – mechanical and service properties of the {{asphaltic concrete}} modified with the mineral polymeric composition. Calcium carbonate is used both as a filler and a coagulant. The chalk was preliminarily ground and hydrophobizated by stearic acid. These operations contribute to even distribution of the filler and interfere with lump coagulation. As a result of the experiments, it was found that the best results were obtained by combining the operations of dispersion and hydrophobization. The optimal amount of stearic acid providing the finest grinding in a ball mill is a content from 3 to 5 % by weight. The optimal grinding time of the filler was found (4 – 6 hours). With increasing dispersion time the particles form agglomerates. Filling the butadiene styrene latex with the hydrophobic fine-grained calcium carbonate was carried out in the laboratory mixer. As a result of the experimental works, it was found that the best distribution of the filler takes place with ratio of rubber: chalk – 100 : 400. The resulting modifier was subjected to the thermal analysis on the derivatograph to determine its application temperature interval. A marked reduction in weight of the mineral polymeric modifier begins at 350 °C. Thus, high temperature of the modifier destruction allows to use it at the temperature of the technological process of asphaltic concrete preparation (up to 170 °C). It was found that an increase in the amount of the carbonate filler in the rubber SKS 30 АRК significantly increases its thermal resistance and connection of the polymer with the chalk in the composition...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD work is {{to develop}} a novel and {{effective}} instrument to characterize the mechanical properties of viscoelastic material. The principle of this system is based on nanoindentation technique, which is widely used in recent years to explore the mechanical properties of various materials. However, quite a few studies demonstrated that the determination of mechanical properties of viscoelastic material by using the standard Oliver Pharr method would lead to incorrect results. Based on this issue, a new improved tribological probe microscopy (TPM) system was established to carry out the investigation of mechanical properties of viscoelastic materials. Materials including polytetrafluoroethylere (PTFE), <b>styrene</b> <b>rubber</b> and nitrile rubber were measured under quasi-static mode of nanoindentation. The inaccurate results proved that static indentation analyzed by the Oliver Pharr method is not suitable for current work. In addition, dynamic indentation was performed to measure these samples. The results demonstrated that it is a good approach to explore time-dependent properties of polymer samples. The dynamic method offers more abundant viscous information. Moreover, another measurement function was added in this facility to perform creep nanoindentation on viscoelastic samples. It enables to generate instant and infinite modulus as well as time constant. The comparison between the results obtained by dynamic and creep indentation reveals that the more physical element should be considered {{to bridge the gap between}} these two approaches. Extra works focus on the relationship between surface topography and its mechanical properties. Finite element simulation as well as actual experiments were performed to investigate the tilt effect on the results of mechanical properties. The results revealed that the standard Oliver Pharr method underestimated the contact area, which will result in overestimating the hardness and elastic modulus of engineering materials. Above all, this study proved the ability of our home made facility to further explore the viscoelastic material. More importantly, it will pave a new way for the investigation of the relationship between the surface topography and viscous property of soft matter including various biomaterials in the near future...|$|E

In this paper, three solution <b>styrene</b> butadiene <b>rubber</b> (SSBR) composites containing various fillers with tailored interfacial chemistry were prepared via conventional mixing technique. Subsequently, thermal and structural features of filled SSBR composites were monitored by TG, DSC, XRD, XPS, FESEM and TEM, respectively.

It was shown that the SSBR filled with silicon dioxide nanoparticles significantly reduced both the friction coefficient and the wear against marble block.

The methods in this research are divided into three sections; mixing, molding, and testing. Mixing required two roll mills as a device blending rubber with filler, accelerator and vulcanizing agent. Molding required hot and cold press molding to form a sheet of product before testing. Testing required a universal testing machine to test the tensile properties of the rubber blend.

The fluorohectorite silicate showed excellent dispersion in natural rubber matrix. The effect of free volume on the gas barrier properties was investigated by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. It was observed that due to the platelet like morphology and high aspect ratio of layered silicates, the gas barrier properties of nano filled latex membranes were very high. The crosslink density values and extent of reinforcement were estimated in order to correlate with the gas barrier properties. The oxygen/nitrogen selectivity of these membranes were investigated.
