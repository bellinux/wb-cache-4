5|$|At {{periodic}} intervals throughout the year, Fark Parties are organized, usually {{in conjunction with}} the travels of Curtis. The practice began in 1999, when Curtis was doing some database consulting in Spartanburg, South Carolina. <b>Staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hotel with nothing to do, he posted a note up on the site asking anybody who lived in the area to email him if they wanted to join him for a beer.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 1977, {{just two}} weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a {{longtime}} fan of Washington's. Pat stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. He pulled himself together, and began {{running up and down the}} flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.|$|E
5|$|After the war, H.D. and Bryher {{no longer}} lived together, but {{remained}} in contact. H.D. moved to Switzerland where, {{in the spring}} of 1946, she suffered a severe mental breakdown, which resulted in her <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> clinic until the autumn of that year. Apart from a number of trips to the States, H.D. spent {{the rest of her life}} in Switzerland. In the late 1950s, she underwent more treatment, this time with the psychoanalyst Erich Heydt. At Heydt's prompting, she wrote End to Torment, a memoir of her relationship with Pound, who allowed the poems of Hilda's Book to be included when the book was published. Doolittle was one of the leading figures in the bohemian culture of London in the early decades of the century. Her later poetry explores traditional epic themes, such as violence and war, from a feminist perspective. H.D. was the first woman to be granted the American Academy of Arts and Letters medal.|$|E
30|$|The {{coefficient}} of length of <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> community was significant at 1 % level and {{positively related to}} loan repayment. Which indicates that the higher the length of <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> particular community, the higher the loan repayment rate. This parallels a priori expectations and conforms to Afolabi’s (2010) results, which reveal that the length of <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> community/experience positively relates to loan repayment. The author further stresses that, the length of <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> community determines social cohesion and group membership trust, which is vital for loan repayment. This also mirrors work by Olagunju and Adeyemo (2007), and Eyo (2008).|$|R

50|$|In 1977, Coggan and {{his wife}} {{attended}} the 5th Assembly of the World Council of Churches in Nairobi, Kenya. The youth delegates <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> college hostel where they slept in bunk beds.

5|$|In Grévy's zebras and {{the wild}} ass species, adults have more fluid {{associations}} and adult males will establish large territories and monopolize the females that enter them. These species live in habitats with sparser resources and standing water and grazing areas may be separated. Groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with non-lactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. The most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas. Mares may wander through several territories but will remain in one when they have young. <b>Staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to a renewable resource. Some feral populations of horse exhibit features of both the harem and territorial social systems.|$|E
5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead of <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> job he loves, getting Bart a ride back to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E
5|$|While Governor Shirley was at Louisbourg trouble {{had been}} brewing between the Royal Navy {{and the people}} of Boston. The Navy had long sought to press Americans into service on its ships. Impressment was a long-standing {{practice}} in Britain, but its application in America was resisted by the colonists. In 1702 Fort William on Castle Island had fired on HMS Swift as it tried to leave Boston Harbour with six recently impressed men aboard. As a result of American complaints (reinforced by British merchants), Parliament in 1708 banned impressment in the American colonies. Navy leaders argued that the American exemption from impressment had been in force only during Queen Anne's War, which ended in 1713. In practice, Royal Navy captains had to apply to colonial governors for a license to press men. In late November 1745 a fight between a press gang and some sailors <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> boarding house in Boston left two of the sailors with fatal injuries. Two members of the press gang were charged with murder and convicted, but were released when the indictment was found invalid.|$|E

25|$|All non-Chinese {{travelers}} {{as well as}} Hong Kong and Macau {{permanent residents}} who stay in Mainland China for more than 24 hours must register with the local PSBs. When <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hotel, the registration is usually done {{as a part of}} the check-in process. When <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> private home, however, the visitor must physically report to the local PSB within 24 hours of arrival for cities or 72 hours for rural areas. All visa-free passengers, including those in transit who stay for more than 24 hours, must adhere to the rule, as failure to comply can result in a fine or being detained by PSB for up to 15 days.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, {{behind the}} scenes, {{negotiations}} began between Milošević and Tuđman to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina into Serb and Croat administered territories {{to attempt to}} avert war between Bosnian Croats and Serbs.

25|$|Lawrence and Frieda soon {{went back}} to Italy, <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cottage in Fiascherino on the Gulf of Spezia.

Both novels were highly controversial, and both were banned on publication in the UK for obscenity (Women in Love only temporarily). Both novels cover grand themes and ideas.|$|E
25|$|However, the IRA {{campaign}} in the area did not begin in earnest until 1971.

Murphy was lightly wounded and arrested by the RUC.

However, two people were killed in the bombing, an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker. Seven others, mostly Yemenis, were severely injured. Two fatwas are said to have been appointed by the most theologically knowledgeable of al-Qaeda's members, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, to justify the killings according to Islamic law. Salim referred to a famous fatwa appointed by Ibn Taymiyyah, a 13th-century scholar much admired by Wahhabis, which sanctioned resistance by any means during the Mongol invasions.|$|E
25|$|Mick {{is upset}} when Shirley leaves Walford after accidentally {{shooting}} Phil. Linda becomes cold towards him {{and refuses to}} have sex; Mick deduces that she is pregnant. She denies this, but he discovers Linda is pregnant and is planning to have a secret abortion. After a discussion, they agree to keep the baby. Stan reveals he has terminal prostate cancer, leading Mick to enlist Dean's help in tracking down Shirley to try and convince her to return. They find her <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> caravan with Buster Briggs (Karl Howman) and she soon returns. Mick and Shirley find that Shirley and Tina's mother, Sylvie, is staying with her sister Babe Smith (Annette Badland). Babe reveals that Sylvie has Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1912, Grand Duke Andrei fell ill with bronchitis. Fearing the onset of tuberculosis, {{he was sent to}} recuperate in the Crimea, <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> palace owned by his cousin Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolayevich. His convalesce was long and he went to Saint-Maurice, Switzerland and to the South of France to recuperate. He liked the French Riviera in {{particular}} and in the spring of 1913, he bought a property for Mathilde in Cap-d'Ail. The villa, located {{on the edge of a}} mountain looking the sea, was named Alam, Mathilde's nickname, Mala, spelled backwards. Upon his return to Russia, Andrei Vladimirovich took part in the 300th anniversary celebrations of the Romanov dynasty. Villa Alam was completely remodeled and Andrei and Mathilde returned there in the spring of 1914, hoping to stay there every spring. However, they were able to return only six years later, after the war, having survived the Russian revolution.|$|E
