40|$|With {{experimentation}} on graphene (an atomic {{layer of}} graphite) {{becoming more and}} more common it is imperative that we have the capability to shape the material beyond the random manner in which it is deposited by mechanical exfoliation. This capability would be invaluable not only for the interesting electronic and optical properties that can be obtained, but also potentially for characterizing the mechanical resonators that {{we have been able to}} fabricate here at Pomona College by suspending few-layer graphene <b>sheets</b> over <b>trenches</b> in SiO 2. We propose novel methods for etching graphene that should allow us to shape the material when used in conjunction with our e-beam lithography capabilities...|$|R

50|$|Trench shields (also called Trench Boxes or <b>Trench</b> <b>Sheets)</b> are {{steel or}} {{aluminum}} structures used for protecting utility workers while performing their duties within a trench. They are customarily constructed with sidewalls of varying thicknesses held apart by steel or aluminum spreaders. Spreaders can be interchanged {{to match the}} width of the trench. The different materials and building designs lead to a variety of depth ratings, i.e. the depth of a trench that the shield can withstand a collapse without buckling. Depth ratings are determined by registered professional engineers.|$|R
40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{cutting of}} few-layer graphene is nowadays {{a hot topic}} in materials research due to its potential applications in the catalysis field and the graphene nanoribbons fabrication. We show here a 3 D analysis of the nanostructuration of few-layer graphene by iron-based nanoparticles under hydrogen flow. The nanoparticles located at the edges or attached to the steps on the FLG <b>sheets</b> create <b>trenches</b> and tunnels with orientations, lengths and morphologies defined by the crystallography and the topography of the carbon substrate. The cross-sectional analysis of the 3 D volumes highlights {{the role of the}} active nanoparticle identity on the trench size and shape, with emphasis on the topographical stability of the basal planes within the resulting trenches and channels, no matter the obstacle encountered. The actual study gives a deep insight on the impact of nanoparticles morphology and support topography on the 3 D character of nanostructures built up by catalytic cutting...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the electrical and mechanical properties of graphene sheets. We perform low temperature electrical transport measurements on gated, quasi- 2 D graphite quantum dots. In devices with low contact resistances, we use longitudinal and Hall resistances to extract a carrier density of 2 - 6 x 1011 holes per sheet and a mobility of 200 - 1900 cm 2 /V-s. In devices with high resistance contacts, we observe Coulomb blockade phenomena and infer the charging energies and capacitive couplings. These experiments demonstrate that electrons in mesoscopic graphite pieces are delocalized over nearly the whole graphite piece down to low temperatures. We also fabricate nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) from ultra thin graphite and graphene by mechanically exfoliating thin <b>sheets</b> over <b>trenches</b> in SiO 2. Vibrations with fundamental resonant frequencies in the MHz range are actuated either optically or electrically and detected optically by interferometry. We demonstrate room temperature charge sensitivities down to 2 x 10 - 3 e/Hz. The thinnest resonator {{consists of a}} single suspended layer of atoms and represents the ultimate limit of a two dimensional NEMS...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Graphene {{deposited}} over {{a trench}} {{has been studied}} {{in the context of}} nanomechanical resonators, where experiments indicate adhesion of the graphene <b>sheet</b> to the <b>trench</b> boundary and sidewalls leads to self-tensioning; however, this adhesion is not well understood. We use molecular dynamics to simulate graphene deposited on a trench and study how adhesion to the sidewalls depends on substrate interaction, temperature, and curvature of the edge of the trench. Over the range of parameters we study, the depth {{at the center of the}} sheet is approximately linear in substrate interaction strength and temperature but not trench width, and we explain this using a one-dimensional model for the sheet configuration...|$|R
40|$|Wave {{barriers}} {{are intended to}} mitigate the transmission of vibrations in the soil actively or passively including open and in-filled <b>trenches,</b> <b>sheet</b> piles, etc. In most previous studies, the effects of governing parameters on screening induced by shallow foundations were examined in which the Rayleigh waves are of importance, In this study, however, the ground vibration isolation of deep foundations, predominantly generating body waves, in clayey soils resting on an homogeneous half-space has been investigated. The effects of geometrical properties of an open trench are studied in details. Three dimensional finite element analyses (FEM) with ANSYS software are utilized to conduct an extensive parametric study on active isolation. The surface to surface contact element for the nonlinearity state of the soil-pile interface as well as nonlinear Drucker-Prager soil behavior under Full Transient analysis have been utilized to obtain more accurate results...|$|R
40|$|We {{carried out}} {{measurements}} on nanoelectromechanical systems based on multilayer graphene <b>sheets</b> suspended over <b>trenches</b> in silicon oxide. The {{motion of the}} suspended sheets was electrostatically driven at resonance using applied radio-frequency voltages. The mechanical vibrations were detected using a novel form of scanning probe microscopy, which allowed identification and spatial imaging of {{the shape of the}} mechanical eigenmodes. In as many as half the resonators measured, we observed a new class of exotic nanoscale vibration eigenmodes not predicted by the elastic beam theory, where the amplitude of vibration is maximum at the free edges. By modeling the suspended sheets with the finite element method, these edge eigenmodes are shown {{to be the result of}} non-uniform stress with remarkably large magnitudes (up to 1. 5 GPa). This non-uniform stress, which arises from the way graphene is prepared by pressing or rubbing bulk graphite against another surface, should be taken into account in future studies on electronic and mechanical properties of graphene...|$|R
40|$|Wave {{barriers}} {{are intended to}} mitigate vibration transmission in the soil. They include open and infilled <b>trenches,</b> <b>sheet</b> piles, etc. In this study, a two-dimensional finite difference element analysis was performed using FLAC- 2 D software as a research into the efficiency of open and infilled barriers exposed to dynamic loading {{with or without the}} presence of structures. In this contribution, two constitutive models are considered to study the soil response in the elastic and elastoplastic range with account for yield, failure and potential functions of soil plasticity. The results were assessed with account for reduced soil particle displacements on the ground surface exposed to impulse loading. The numerical analysis has proven that the results obtained by assigning elastic properties to the soil material fail to comply with the results obtained by analyzing the model having non-linear properties of soils. The presence of a structure produces a significantly larger effect onto the efficiency of barriers by reducing the surface wave energy.

40|$|Background: Conservation Agriculture (CA) {{technology}} {{is one of}} the options to curb problems arise from high runoff rates, soil erosion, period drought, period water logging in vertisols and low crop productivity in Northern highlands of Ethiopia. Hence, a long-term tillage experiment has been carried out (2005 to 2010) on a Vertisol to quantify changes in runoff, soil loss and crop yield due to Conservation Agriculture (CA) in the sub-humid Dogua Tembien district of the Northern highlands of Ethiopia. Methods and Materials: The experimental layout was implemented in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications on permanent plots of 5 m by 19 m. The tillage treatments were (i) permanent raised bed (PB) in a furrow and bed system with 30 % standing crop residue retention and no-tillage on top of the bed, (ii) reduced tillage (RT), with ploughing once at sowing with 30 % standing crop residue retention and contour furrows made at 1. 5 m distance interval, and (iii) conventional tillage (CT) with a minimum of 3 tillage operations and removal of crop residues. All ploughing, as well as refreshing of the furrows of the permanent raised beds when sowing, was done using the local ard plough mahresha. Crops planted during the five years were wheat, grass pea, wheat, hanfets (wheat and barley sown together) and grass pea. Glyphosate was sprayed starting from the third year (2007) at 2 L/ha before planting to control pre-emergent weed in PB and TER. Runoff and soil loss were measured in plastic <b>sheet</b> lined collector <b>trenches,</b> which were located {{at the lower end of}} each plot. Crop stands were evaluated with local farmers and NDVI was measured on the spot at several phenological stages, using green seeker. Result and Discussion: Significantly different (p< 0. 05) mean soil losses of 14, 17 and 24 t ha- 1 y- 1 were recorded for PB, RT and CT, respectively. Similarly, the mean runoff during the rainy seasons (three months) of five study periods was 900, 1011 and 1091 m 3 ha- 1 y- 1 from plots with PB, RT and CT, respectively. Five years mean runoff coefficients were 23, 26 and 28 % in PB, RT and CT, respectively. The farmers‘ evaluation of crop performance in three years (2008 - 2010) showed a significantly higher score for PB (6 / 10) and least for CT (4. 8 / 10). The NDVI of wheat (2008) was significantly higher in PB followed by RT up to 85 days after planting as compare to CT. However, after 85 days from planting CT was higher than the others due to wheat on PB was matured and dried earlier than CT. The growth of wheat in CT was slower. Plant height of wheat (2010) was significantly higher in PB throughout the growing season. Although improvements in crop yield were observed, a period of at least four years of cropping was required before they became significant. Conclusion: Overall, the permanent raised bed and reduced tillage systems significantly reduced sediment loss and runoff, and increased crop yield. It is suggested that these tillage techniques, using the local plough without modifications, be implemented widely...|$|R
