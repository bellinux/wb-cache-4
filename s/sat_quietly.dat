5|$|In court Denning {{preferred}} to let counsel talk on {{for as long}} as they wanted to so that he could get a grasp of the situation without wading through irrelevant court papers; to prevent them going on too long he <b>sat</b> <b>quietly</b> and allowed them to wind down at their own pace.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} the FDA interviewed physicians, Reich's {{students}} and his patients, asking about the orgone accumulators. A professor at the University of Oregon who bought an accumulator told an FDA inspector that he knew the device was phoney, but found it helpful because his wife <b>sat</b> <b>quietly</b> in it for four hours every day.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1927, Messiaen joined Dupré's organ course. Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, <b>sat</b> <b>quietly</b> for an hour while Dupré {{explained}} and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ.|$|E

25|$|Musicians {{were free}} to join in, but such collaborations were often {{short-lived}} if the contributions were lacking the proper spirit: notable jazz saxophonist Steve Lacy sat in with the group but was quickly asked to stop playing. Observers were welcome, provided they were silent and didn't disturb the proceedings. American saxophonist Ornette Coleman was asked to leave after he continually talked during one performance; Beatles member Paul McCartney once <b>sat</b> <b>quietly</b> through an early AMM session. When asked how he liked the music he said they went on too long.|$|E
25|$|Distraction from sadness using {{art therapy}} {{may be a}} better {{alternative}} than venting sadness. Two studies by Drake and Winner (2012) published from the American Psychological Association compared venting (expressing negative feelings) and distraction (expressing something that is not related to negative feelings) in one study. To distract oneself, the participants were told to draw something unrelated to a sad film they had watched. The participants who had vented were told to draw something related to the film. In study 2, the participants were told to think of a sad event and were put into the venting, distraction, and calming position or sitting conditions. The sitting condition allowed the passage of time to be evaluated. In study 1, the distraction method in which the participants drew something unrelated to the sad film significantly improved negative mood compared to the venting condition. In study 2, the distraction method in which the participants drew a house (something unrelated to the sad event), had significantly improved negative mood compared to venting (drawing the sad event) or the sitting condition (<b>sat</b> <b>quietly</b> for 10 minutes). Therefore, art therapy could be beneficial to people suffering from depressive moods through a way of distraction rather than venting.|$|E
500|$|In the pandemonium that followed, Bellingham <b>sat</b> <b>quietly</b> {{on a bench}} as Perceval {{was carried}} into the Speaker's quarters. In the lobby, such was the {{confusion}} that, according to a witness, had Bellingham [...] "walked quietly out into the street, he would have escaped, and the committer of the murder {{would never have been}} known". As it was, an official who had seen the shooting identified Bellingham, who was seized, disarmed, manhandled and searched. He remained calm, submitting to his captors without a struggle. When asked to explain his actions, he replied that he was rectifying a denial of justice {{on the part of the}} government.|$|E

500|$|Team manager Gibbs {{reported}} {{that at the}} end of the first day's play the Australian dressing room was stunned into silence. Egar asked Benaud for permission to enter, and after the Australian captain allowed him in, the umpire <b>sat</b> <b>quietly</b> for a period before speaking to some other players and then to Meckiff. The pair were close friends, and shook hands before putting their arms around one another's shoulders. The condemned bowler did not take Egar's judgment personally and did not have hard feelings about the incident. Egar claimed to be [...] "the second most upset person in the world", and later added that he thought Meckiff's first ball was suspect. He said that he could have called more deliveries, but was worried whether the over would ever end.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} Johnson's {{entrance}} {{interview for}} Pembroke, his anxious father introduced him to his future tutor, William Jorden, hoping to make an impression. During the interview, his father was [...] "very full of the merits of his son, and told the company {{he was a good}} scholar, and a poet, and wrote Latin verses", which caused Johnson significant embarrassment. Michael's praise was unnecessary; Johnson's interview went so well that one of the interviewers, a 26-year-old William Adams (Jorden's cousin, later Master of Pembroke), claimed that Johnson was [...] "the best qualified for the University that he had ever known come there". Throughout the interview, Johnson <b>sat</b> <b>quietly</b> while listening to his father and the interviewers, until he interrupted and quoted Macrobius. The interviewers were surprised that [...] "a School-boy should know Macrobius", and he was accepted immediately.|$|E
500|$|Mary met {{her future}} husband during an air raid on Liverpool in 1940, when Jim was 38 years old, and had settled into what his friends thought was, [...] "a {{confirmed}} bachelorhood." [...] Mary had been too career-conscious to think of marriage and, {{at the age of}} 31 years, was thought of as a spinster. They met in June 1940, at 11 Scargreen Avenue, West Derby, the McCartney family home. Mary was staying with Jim's sister, Jin, {{because of the lack of}} accommodation in Liverpool at the time. As Mary <b>sat</b> <b>quietly</b> in an armchair, the air-raid sirens sounded at 9:30. At that time, the group moved to the Anderson shelter in the back garden to wait for the all-clear, but as there was an intensive bombing raid, the signal did not come and everyone was thus forced to sit in the cellar until dawn. Mary talked long enough with Jim to become romantically interested in him, and thought that he was [...] "utterly charming and uncomplicated," [...] as well as being entertained by his [...] "considerable good humour." [...] They took out a marriage licence at Liverpool Town Hall on 8 April 1941, and were married a week later at St. Swithin's Roman Catholic chapel in Gillmoss, West Derby, on 15 April 1941. They first lived at 10 Sunbury Road, Anfield, and then resided for a short time at 92 Broadway, Wallasey, during November 1942. Jim's job at Napiers was classified as war work, so the McCartneys were given a small, but temporary, prefab house at 3 Roach Avenue, Knowsley.|$|E

2500|$|She <b>sat</b> <b>quietly</b> at {{the meeting}} for 30 or 40 minutes, before pulling out a 9mm handgun [...] "just before" [...] 4:00p.m. CST, {{according}} to a faculty member. Joseph Ng, an associate professor who witnessed the attack, said: [...] " [...] got up suddenly, took out a gun and started shooting at each one of us. She started with the one closest to her, and went down the row shooting her targets in the head." [...] According to another survivor, Debra Moriarity, dean of the university's graduate program {{and a professor of}} biochemistry, [...] "This wasn't random shooting around the room; this was execution style." [...] Those who were shot were {{on one side of the}} oval table used during the meeting, and the five on the other side, including Ng, dropped to the floor.|$|E

2500|$|On July 15, 1984, {{three days}} before the shooting, Huberty commented to his wife, Etna, that he {{suspected}} he might have a mental problem. Two days later, on July 17, he called a mental health clinic, requesting an appointment. Leaving his contact details with the receptionist, he was assured the clinic would return his call within hours. According to his wife, he <b>sat</b> <b>quietly</b> beside the telephone for several hours, awaiting the return call, before abruptly walking out of the family home and riding to an unknown destination on his motorcycle. Unbeknownst to Huberty, the receptionist had misspelled his name as [...] "Shouberty". His polite demeanor conveyed no sense of immediate urgency to the operator; therefore, the call was logged as a [...] "non-crisis" [...] inquiry, to be handled within 48 hours.|$|E
60|$|Ormsgill, {{who made}} no answer, turned towards the door, and spoke {{a few words}} to the sentry. The latter called to one of his comrades, and Ormsgill, after giving the man a message came back again and <b>sat</b> down <b>quietly.</b>|$|R

6000|$|...
