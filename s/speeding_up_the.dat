5|$|The {{value of}} the Admiralty Islands to the Allies was enormous. Their capture saved more lives than they cost by obviating the need to capture Truk, Kavieng, Rabaul, and Hansa Bay and thereby <b>speeding</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Allied advance by several months. As an airbase, the Admiralties' value was great, for {{aircraft}} based there ranged over Truk, Wewak, and beyond. As a naval base, their value was greater still, as they combined a fleet anchorage with major facilities.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare two methods for forming reduced models to <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> genetic-algorithm-based optimization. <b>The</b> methods work by forming {{functional}} approximations of the tness function {{which are used}} to <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> GA optimization. One method <b>speeds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> optimization by making the genetic operators more informed. <b>The</b> other method <b>speeds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> optimization by genetically en-gineering some individuals instead of using the regular Darwinian evolution approach. Empirical results in several engineering de-sign domains are presented. ...|$|R

50|$|Increase in {{temperature}} can <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> desired reaction, but also <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> decomposition of reagents and starting materials. However, pressure can <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> desired reaction and only impacts decomposition when {{it involves the}} release of a gas or a reaction with a gas in the vessel. When the desired reaction is accelerated, competing reactions are minimized. Pressure generally enables faster reactions with cleaner reaction profiles.|$|R
5|$|No. 4 Commando {{made the}} {{crossing}} to Dieppe on board HMS Prins Albert. The crossing was uneventful and at 04:50 just before daybreak Group one landed unopposed. Using two Bangalore torpedos to blow {{a hole in}} the barbed wire, they managed to scale the cliffs. As they approached the battery at 05:45 it opened fire on the main landing force coming ashore at Dieppe. This was 30 minutes before Group one was expected {{to be in a position}} but Mills-Roberts responded by <b>speeding</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> advance to get their guns into action sooner. Once in position they opened fire on the battery with their mortars, Bren machine guns and sniper rifles. One of the mortar bombs landed inside the battery and exploded the stored charges, putting the guns out of action.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January {{a native}} {{reported}} seeing seven Japanese {{in the hills}} south west of Sio and a patrol was sent out under Corporal Bengari to investigate. On arriving in the vicinity on 24 January, a local reported that another 22 Japanese had arrived. The next morning, Bengari and his five companions ambushed the Japanese and killed them all before they could fire a shot. Wirraway and Boomerang aircraft of No. 4 Squadron RAAF scouted ahead of the advance. Its aerial reconnaissance work let the Australians and Papuans know where opposition could be expected, thereby <b>speeding</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> advance. The pilots noted Japanese parachutes, signs that the Japanese were receiving supplies by air. On 4 February, the Australians were also forced onto air supply, as swollen rivers washed {{out a number of}} bridges.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of May19 there were further discussions at Rodríguez Peña's house. Saavedra, called by Viamonte, joined the meeting, which {{involved}} military and civilian leaders. They arranged that Belgrano and Saavedra would meet with Juan José de Lezica, the senior alcalde (municipal magistrate), while Castelli would meet with the procurator Julián de Leiva, to ask for their support. They asked the Viceroy to allow an open cabildo, and said {{that if it was}} not freely granted the people and the criollo troops would march to the Plaza, force the Viceroy to resign by any means necessary, and replace him with a patriot government. Saavedra commented to Lezica that he was suspected of betrayal because of his constant requests for cautious and measured steps. This comment was designed to pressure Lezica into <b>speeding</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> legal system to allow the people to express themselves, or otherwise risk a major rebellion. Lezica asked for patience and time to persuade the Viceroy, and leave a massive demonstration as a last resort. He argued that if the Viceroy was deposed in that way, it would constitute a rebellion, which would turn the revolutionaries into outlaws. Manuel Belgrano gave the following Monday as the deadline to confirm the open cabildo before taking direct action. Leiva would later act as a mediator, being both a confidante of Cisneros and a trusted negotiator for the more moderate revolutionaries.|$|E

By 1810, Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin reported that the U.S. had some 50 cotton-yarn mills, many of them started in response to the Embargo of 1807 that cut off imports from Britain prior to the War of 1812. That war resulted in <b>speeding</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> process of industrialization in New England. By war's end in 1815, there were 140 cotton manufacturers within 30 miles of Providence, employing 26,000 hands and operating 130,000 spindles. The American textile industry was launched.|$|E
