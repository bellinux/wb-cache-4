British rock band Nine Black Alps also noted the album as a major influence on their third release, Locked Out from the Inside (2009), and indie singer-songwriter Scout Niblett cited it as a major influence on her: [...] "For me, the thing that I loved about them and her [...] was the anger, and aggressiveness, along with the tender side", said Niblett. [...] "That was something I hadn't seen before in a woman playing music. That was hugely influential and really inspiring. Women up 'til then were kind of one-dimensional, twee, sweet, ethereal, and that annoys the shit out of me." ...|$|E

In 1992, Raging Slab (a band notorious for having over 25 different drummers {{over the course of the}} band's 18-year career), complete with Irons on drums, began recording the follow-up to its 1989 RCA Records self-titled debut, with producer Michael Beinhorn at the helm. The entire album was recorded, mixed, and mastered; however when RCA Records executives heard the album, it was rejected. The album, titled Freeburden, remains unreleased. In 2000, Irons played as part of the initial line-up of Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade.

2500|$|While Rolling Stone {{compared}} {{the effect of}} Love's marriage to Cobain on the band to that of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, they noted that [...] "Love's confrontational stage presence, {{as well as her}} gut-wrenching vocals and powerful punk-pop songcraft, made her an alternative-rock star in her own right." [...] Author Nick Wise made a similar comparison in discussion of the band's public image, stating, [...] "Not since Yoko Ono's marriage to John Lennon has a woman's personal life and exploits within the rock arena been so analyzed and dissected." [...] The band has been cited as a major influence on several contemporary artists, including indie singer-songwriter Scout Niblett, Avril Lavigne, Brody Dalle (of The Distillers and <b>Spinnerette),</b> Sky Ferreira, Lana Del Rey, Tove Lo, Tegan and Sara, and the British rock band Nine Black Alps.

50|$|Dissolving pulp {{is used in}} {{production}} of regenerated cellulose. In the regenerated cellulose process the cellulose is converted to cellulose xanthate which dissolves easily in caustic soda. The resulting viscous liquid can be extruded through <b>spinnerettes</b> and regenerated as man-made fibres. Cellulose can also be dissolved in some organic solvents directly and processed to regenerate the cellulose fibres in different forms. The lyocell process uses an amine oxide to dissolve cellulose and Tencel is the only commercial example of this direct-dissolution process, which unlike the viscose process is pollution-free.|$|R
40|$|Tencel {{is a new}} fiber made in {{a process}} that is similar to the {{creation}} of rayon. As with rayon, cellulose, primarily from wood pulp, is used to make the fiber. Whether this creates a natural product is open to discussion. The process involves dissolving wood pulp with a solvent which unlike the process for rayon orcupra, is a relatively non-toxic amine. The dissolved pulp is then forced through tiny holes called <b>spinnerettes</b> creating long, smooth, lusterous fibers much like silk in appearance and drape. It can be dyed to deep color. When spuning tencel fiber it is quite luscious. It has that wonderful silken sheen. One knows that no silk worms died to produce it. It can be very slippery to spin so it is not a beginner's fiber, but anyone ready for silk can handle it with ease. Many spinners have a great enthusiasm for this new fiber. You get the benefits of silk at halfthe price. However, to dye you will have to use a procion type dye for cellulose rather than the acid dyes one can use on a protein fiber like natural sil...|$|R
