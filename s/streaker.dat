5|$|In the 1996/1997 season, O'Sullivan won two ranking titles: the Asian Classic by {{narrowly}} defeating Brian Morgan 9–8 in the final, and the German Open by defeating Alain Robidoux 9–7 in the final. O'Sullivan again {{reached the}} final of the Charity Challenge, where he faced Stephen Hendry in a first-to-nine frame match. O'Sullivan trailed 2–8 before winning six frames in a row to level at 8–8, before Hendry won the deciding frame with a maximum break. At the Masters, O'Sullivan reached his third consecutive final, where he faced Steve Davis. After O'Sullivan took the first two frames with back-to-back century breaks of 116 and 113, the third frame was disrupted by a <b>streaker,</b> Lianne Croft. Davis later stated that the streaking incident affected O'Sullivan's concentration, allowing him back into the match and the afternoon session ended all-square at 4–4. O'Sullivan began the evening session by winning four frames in 49 minutes to take an 8–4 lead, but Davis fought back to win the next six frames and clinch the title with a 10–8 victory. On 21 April 1997, while playing Mick Price {{in the first round of}} the World Championship, O'Sullivan made the fastest ever competitive maximum break in 5 minutes and 20 seconds, an average of one shot every 8.8 seconds. This was also O'Sullivan's first maximum break in professional competition. He exited the World Championship in the second round, losing 12–13 against Darren Morgan. O'Sullivan also won the non-ranking European League, defeating Hendry 10–8 in the final.|$|E

25|$|The ground {{hosted a}} One Day International between New Zealand and Australia {{as part of}} the 1981–82 Australia Tour of New Zealand. The {{attendance}} of 43,000 was a then-record for a cricket game in New Zealand. The match was notable for Australian batsman Greg Chappell dealing with an on ground <b>streaker</b> with his bat. An indoor cricket facility and stand were built next to the outer oval.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} {{associated}} with sporting events but can occur in more secluded areas. It usually involves running quickly which also reflects the original meaning of the word before it became associated with nudity. <b>Streakers</b> are often pursued by sporting officials or by the police. In some instances, <b>streakers</b> are not fully nude, instead wearing minimal clothing.|$|R

25|$|Just {{before the}} start of the second half, a British <b>streaker,</b> Mark Roberts, ran onto the field {{disguised}} as a referee, undressed, and performed a dance wearing only a thong. He was tackled to the ground by Patriots linebacker Matt Chatham and arrested. It is customary for American television to avoid broadcasting such events, but it was later shown on Late Show with David Letterman. He received a $1,000 fine for trespassing.|$|E
25|$|The Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) {{family of}} tracked {{vehicles}} were {{designed in the}} 1960s. The family includes the FV101 Scorpion, FV102 Striker, FV103 Spartan, FV104 Samaritan, FV105 Sultan, FV106 Samson, FV107 Scimitar, FV4333 Stormer, and the <b>Streaker.</b> The first vehicle of this series was the FV101 Scorpion, {{which was the first}} aluminium hull tank ever to be built. The hull and turret are actually fabricated from a welded aluminium-zinc-magnesium alloy. Seventeen Scorpion prototypes were delivered for field testing in February 1969.|$|E
25|$|The peak of Australia's form {{proved to}} be brief. The team lost a number of players to early retirement, mainly because {{remuneration}} was so poor. Chappell was able to parlay his position into a reasonable income with his Queensland contract and personal endorsements, but he still needed to develop business interests in life insurance outside the game. His leadership abilities were tested {{in the summer of}} 1976–77 as a number of new players were blooded and Jeff Thomson was laid low by long-term injury. Australia received much criticism for defensive play during a drawn series with Pakistan, but Chappell's form was faultless, and he scored 121 and 67 in the only Test victory. The tour to New Zealand that followed was similar; it was clear Australia was in a rebuilding phase. During the Test at Auckland, a <b>streaker</b> appeared when Chappell was at the crease. Incensed by this new craze and the disruption that it caused, Chappell grabbed the man and hit his bare backside with the bat. When play resumed, the ensuing din from the incident caused Chappell to mis-hear his partner's call for a run, and he found himself run out. For once, the famous Chappell concentration had been broken. But the most significant occurrence of this match occurred off-field: Chappell was approached to sign with a proposed break away competition, later to be known as World Series Cricket (WSC).|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{particularly}} {{close up}} nature of snooker, {{there have been}} a number of <b>streakers</b> in snooker tournaments. The first was Lianne Crofts in the final of the 1997 Benson & Hedges Masters between Steve Davis and Ronnie O'Sullivan. Since then there have been two <b>streakers</b> at the World Snooker Championship. The first was Andrew Slater, who appeared in a Sven-Göran Eriksson mask and socks during a match between Paul Hunter and Quinten Hann in 2002. Then, during the final in 2004 between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Graeme Dott, Mark Roberts ran down the stairs and tried to claim asylum under the table.|$|R
5000|$|Streaking is {{distinct}} from naturism or nudism in that <b>streakers</b> usually intend to be noticed and may choose a place with a large audience for their act, regardless {{of the risk of}} arrest (sometimes even intending to end up in police custody), whereas naturists and nudists generally prefer to be left in peace. It is also distinct from [...] "flashing", in that the intent is generally not to shock or traumatize a victim. <b>Streakers</b> may streak only once or a few times, possibly {{as a result of a}} dare, or may streak so often it can be considered a hobby.|$|R
2500|$|Boyd {{has also}} become famous for his {{behaviour}} off the pitch after the ex-boyfriend of a woman he was in bed with caught them and assaulted him. Boyd was then forced to flee semi-naked across a [...] "posh estate" [...] and suffered bruises and injuries to his feet. Boyd refused to take any legal action against his attacker, claiming that {{he just wants to}} [...] "forget about it". Coincidentally, months before during Hartlepool's pre-season tour in the Netherlands, a <b>streaker</b> ran onto the pitch and danced in front of him.|$|E
2500|$|The wing's 728th Armament Systems Group managed Suppression of Enemy Defense and Destruction of Enemy Defense {{targeting}} systems, the Miniature Air Launched Decoy, and all Air Force aerial targets. These aerial targets {{included the}} McDonnell QF-4 Phantom II drone, Ryan BQM-34 Firebee, Beechcraft MQM-107 <b>Streaker</b> and the BQM-167 Skeeter. The targets are remotely controlled, employ countermeasures and provide [...] "scores" [...] {{on how well}} their missiles perform. The 728th Group was composed of three squadrons: the 691st Armament Systems Squadron, responsible for aerial targets; the 692nd Armament Systems Squadron, responsible for the Miniature Air Launched Decoy; and the 693rd Armament Systems Squadron, responsible for the AGM-88 HARM Targeting System.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after {{development}} of the -400 variant for the Harpoon began, Teledyne began work on a new variant, the J402-CA-700 for the new MQM-107 <b>Streaker</b> aerial target drone. These target drones were not [...] "one-time-use" [...] vehicles like the Harpoon missiles were, so the lifetime of the engine had to be extended from one hour to 15 hours. To accomplish this, the turbine temperature was reduced, {{as well as the}} rotational speeds. A new starter system was included to give the engine the ability to restart. The result was an engine that was slightly less powerful, at 640lbf (2.8kN) versus the -400's 660lbf (2.9kN), but had the required service life.|$|E

2500|$|He openly {{criticized the}} {{actions by the}} Chappell {{brothers}} (Trevor and Greg) in the post-match reaction to the underarm bowling incident of 1981, proving his moral integrity far outweighed his unconditional patriotism for Australia. He vacated the commentary booth when New Zealand was about to clinch a test victory at Lord's in 1999, allowing former New Zealand captain-turned-commentator Ian Smith to call the famous victory of his compatriots. Some of his other memorable moments he commentated on included Shane Warne's [...] "Ball of the Century", Ian Botham's dominant all-round display during 1981 Ashes, Dennis Lillee overtaking Benaud's record for most wickets, and subsequent 300th and 310th wickets, and Andrew Symonds' tackle on a <b>streaker.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Moments {{after the}} Jackson-Timberlake tangle, <b>streaker</b> Mark Roberts {{added to the}} {{controversial}} halftime by running around the field naked except for some writing on his body which read [...] "SUPER BOWEL" [...] on the front, an advertisement for an online betting website, and a well-placed G-string attached to half of a miniature football covering Roberts' genitals. Part of Roberts' stunt was broadcast in the United States; CBS chose to keep its cameras in a wide-shot view of the stadium and use quick cutaways to players and coaches as Roberts ran around the field until players from both competing teams, the New England Patriots and the Carolina Panthers, tackled him. Matt Chatham, the Patriots' special teams expert and reserve linebacker initially knocked Roberts down, thus allowing stadium security and police to arrest Roberts and take him into custody.|$|E
2500|$|After {{making their}} way into good attacking field position, England played the ball ten metres out from Australia's {{goal-line}} where centre Paul Newlove at dummy-half ran the ball at the defence forced his way through to score in the left corner. [...] The sideline conversion attempt by Goulding missed so England trailed 8 – 10 after five minutes of the second half. Around the ten-minute mark the game {{was interrupted by a}} topless female <b>streaker.</b> The play continued swinging {{from one end of the}} field to the other, with neither team able to capitalise on their scoring opportunities for the next twenty minutes. Australian interchange player Jason Smith was blood binned and had to return to the bench. A few minutes later the Kangaroos had made their way deep into England's half when, on the last tackle, the ball was moved through the hands and eventually flicked passed back from Johns as he was being tackled to the feet of Brasher who kicked it ahead to the try-line. Both fullbacks then scrambled to get to the ball and the referee ruled that Brasher had grounded it, awarding Australia a try. Johns converted the try so Australia lead 8 – 16 with just over ten minutes remaining. England forward Karl Harrison then had to come off the field with an injured arm. A few minutes from full-time Australian forward Mark Carroll was sent to the sin-bin for an infringement in the ruck. The remainder of the match extended into additional injury time but was played with no further points so Australia retained the World Cup with an 8 – 16 victory and their fifth consecutive world title.|$|E
5000|$|The current {{record for}} the largest group streak was {{established}} at the University of Georgia, with 1,543 simultaneous <b>streakers</b> on March 7, 1974. The University of Colorado comes in second with 1,200 <b>streakers,</b> and the University of Maryland ranks third, with 553 naked students streaking three miles in March 1974. Erskine College claimed the highest per-capita streak, when 25% of its 600 students participated in a streaking party in 1974. It is also believed that an alumni from Cornell College in Iowa has streaked the homecoming pep rally (estimated 1,200 attendees) 7 consecutive years without being caught. This individual streaked all four years he attended Cornell College and continued to streak for the 3 years following his graduation.|$|R
50|$|The game {{included}} several impersonators and <b>streakers,</b> {{but at the}} end of the game, when Ireland had come from behind to win with goals in the dying seconds of the match, the crowd rushed the field, causing much controversy with the Australian players.|$|R
50|$|The {{most public}} form of {{streaking}} is running naked before huge crowds at sporting events. However, many <b>streakers</b> seek quieter venues, {{such as a}} neighborhood at night after most people have gone to bed. Some have even found it especially satisfying to streak on rural highways {{in the very early}} hours of the morning, when there are not many commuters on the road. A number of <b>streakers</b> do not intend to expose themselves to others, but find it thrilling to do it in places that often have people present, but do not {{at the time of their}} streak. Streaking may be an individual or a group activity. It is not uncommon for videos of some of the more daring streaks to find popularity on the internet.|$|R
