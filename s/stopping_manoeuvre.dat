40|$|Fast new {{technologies}} in ship science {{are the reason}} that existing processes are reanalysed. The scope of this work is {{an analysis of the}} emergency <b>stopping</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> of a containership whereby fundamental thoughts about the forces and moments on the coupled systems of ship and engine are necessary. The stopping time and the stopping distance are dependant on the ship's mass, the resistance of the hull, the propeller and propulsion unit. Therefore: - The kinetic energy of the moving ship, - the kinetic energy of the rotating propeller, - the resistance of the hull and friction work of the propulsion unit are the governing factors in the process of stopping a ship. It seems that in recent years a change for the worse with respect to an emergency manoeuvre of a ship has taken place. A reason for this might be the increase of the power concentration on the propulsion engines. Changes on the system 'engine' are therefore suggested which finally can lead to a possible improvement of the emergency <b>stopping</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> (orig.)

40|$|Braking to a {{full stop}} at a {{prescribed}} target position is a driving manoeuvre regularly used in experiments to investigate driving behaviour or to test vehicle acceleration feedback systems in simulators. Many different performance measures {{have been reported in}} the literature for analysing braking. These may or may not be useful to analyse the <b>stopping</b> <b>manoeuvre,</b> because a number of potential problems exist: 1) the scores on a measure may be insufficiently reliable, 2) the measure may be invalid, or 3) the measure may be strongly intercorrelated. A simulation and empirical study were conducted to analyse various measures. From the simulation study it was concluded that 1) An R 2 measure based on the speed vs time relationship can be used to measure deviations from a constant deceleration, 2) minimum time-to-collision is sensitive to target position offsets, and 3) mean TTC-dot can capture braking behaviour characteristics but the required definition of a begin and end sample-point for its calculation is a disadvantage. The empirical study calculated a set of measures using data of 60 participants driving a simulation-based session of 10 stops. It is concluded that reliable and valid measures for a braking experiment are provided by the speed and distance to the target position at braking onset, the stopping position with respect to the target and the R 2 measure to measure deviations from a constant deceleration. Recommended additional measures are: The mean speed of the complete braking manoeuvre, stopping position consistency, maximum deceleration and onset jerk.

40|$|The {{results of}} a virtual reality {{experimental}} survey, aimed at evaluating how cross-section width affects driver’s behaviour, are reported. Two two-lane rural roads were implemented in an interactive driving simulator. Each one is characterised by a different cross section width but same alignment. The configurations of the surveyed cross sections were those recommended by the Italian technical regulation for rural roads (type C 1) and for local roads (type F 2). The alignment was designed with tangents, clothoids and curves. 64 drivings were performed. Four parameters were determined on each geometrical element of the alignment with different cross section width: average speed, range of speed, average trajectory and range of lateral position on cross section. The narrowing of the cross section width causes the decrease of speed but does not alter the way the driver adjusts his speed driving from a design elements to another along the alignment. The adjustment of the speed is therefore affected exclusively by the geometry of the axis of the alignment. The values of speed obtained indicate that the assumption of the same maximum design speed (Vdmax) {{for the design of}} alignments with different cross section width determines a degree of safety, with respect to the <b>stopping</b> <b>manoeuvre,</b> that is inferior in alignments with a wider section. With respect to the values collected on cross section C 1, on the cross section F 2 a greater dispersion of speed and a greater number of cases of occupation of the shoulder and of the opposite lane (an event which was never recorded in section C 1), were recorded. The importance of the shoulder in the driver’s choice of lateral position and his propensity to drive near the axis of the space he perceives as utilizable, consisting of the lane and shoulder, was confirmed...|$|E

40|$|Driving {{simulators}} {{can be used}} {{to examine}} dangerous situations and new systems without risks to the test driver. Driving situations can moreover be systematically varied and presented in a simulator. However, the validity of the results with regard to real driving must be established. From the different aspects of driving behaviour, this paper focuses on longitudinal control of the car as one of the basic tasks that drivers have to perform. The most common driving strategy in real-life stopping behaviour is the utilisation of a constant deceleration rate. The question we address is: Do drivers behave similarly in simulator experiments? Reymond et al demonstrated the important role of kinaesthetic cues. They proved that motion response generally increases the validity of driving behaviour in virtual environments. Siegler et al conducted a small braking experiment and found that braking strategies remained stable, and that decelerations were within realistic ranges in the presence of motion cues. Further, the drivers were able to stop at a specific given point of the road. A more comprehensive approach was used by Boer et al with the scope of analysing time sequences instead of statistical characteristic values of a complete braking or <b>stopping</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> A set of useful decision- and control-based variables were introduced and the results were validated with real-world driving data. In later analysis, they tried to find the optimal scaling factor and its general valid function based on the biases in distance, speed and acceleration perception. The insights obtained by these former studies were used to intensively analyse the data of an experiment conducted at the DLR Institute of Transportation Systems. In order to evaluate the participant’s ability to control a car within the new dynamic driving simulator (6 DoF), the driving behaviour in the simulator is compared to driving in the real world with an equipped car (the DLR ViewCar). The influence of different motion platform characteristics on the validity of the braking behaviour is investigated and presented in this paper...|$|E

After several trials of normal walking with voluntary <b>stopping,</b> distracting <b>manoeuvres</b> and obstacles on the walkway were used to provoke freezing or festination. The gait variables of normal (off phase), festinating, prestop, and prefreezing strides were analysed using analysis of variance for repeated-measures. Cadence was excessively increased (68 %) and stride length decreased (69 %) during festination compared with normal off walking; a pattern which remained pronounced when comparing prefreezing strides with normal stopping. Analysing in more detail the three steps before a freeze, we found a progressive decrease of stride length and stable cadence rates and proportions of double support phases. The relationship between cadence and stride length exhibited an exponential increase of cadence with a decreasing stride length during festination and freezing. Results suggest that freezing is caused by a combination of an increasing inability to generate stride length superimposed on a dyscontrol of the cadence of walking. status: publishe...|$|R

The note deals with both the requirements for adequate "foresight" and with the means to provide the required "foresight". The note defines the "driving task" as the sequence of decision-making processes {{that has to be}} followed by a car driver. The driving task requires a considerable amount of information, for the greater part visual information. The note {{concentrates on}} improving the visual information. The note distinguishes eight different driving subtasks. Each subtask is described using the following subheadings: (1) task elements; (2) manoeuvres.

Two "visually critical elements" are: (a) road markings; and (b) lighting columns; and (5) remarks. The paper determines the required "foresight" values for three road types. These values depend on the different manoeuvres to be executed. The road types include: (i) urban roads with a traffic function; (ii) rural trunk roads (primary roads); and (iii) rural motorways...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This study aimed to extend the knowledge on player and surface loading by contributing new data {{in relation to a}} greater range of movements, relevant in-game scenarios and on carefully controlled third generation artificial turf surfaces. This was done by selecting soccer relevant movements and in-game scenarios for a player movement study {{with the help of a}} player focus group and questionnaire. Furthermore, four surfaces were created with surface hardness and rotational traction values at the upper and lower limits of the standards set by FIFA. The study showed that both the surface hardness and rotational traction properties can affect the human movement dynamics, though these effects were mainly present during the <b>stop</b> and turn <b>manoeuvre.</b> During the <b>stop</b> and turn <b>manoeuvre</b> the soft and high traction surfaces conditions led to increased frontal plane moments as well as increased average ground reaction forces during mid-stance. In combination with decreased ground contact times it appeared that the players were able to decelerate / accelerate faster and generate a larger force on the soft and high traction surfaces. During peak push off it appeared that the players were able to generate a larger force on the hard surfaces, which also led to a significant increase in plantar flexion moment. While some parameters showed an effect for surface hardness and / or rotational traction across all four surface conditions, for others such as the knee valgus, hip extension and hip internal rotation moment showed only a significant effect between two of the four surfaces. At the same time the other surfaces showed either no effect or the opposite effect. This suggests that the effects of the surface hardness can be influenced by the rotational traction properties, and vice versa. Regarding the jumping / heading manoeuvre the effects of the surface conditions were limited. This may have been related to the high demands of the movement, or to limitations of the mechanical measurement methods. In addition to the effects of surface properties on human movement dynamics the study also showed that the mechanical measurement methods may not be representative of the human loading. The impact force conditions of the advanced artificial athlete were substantially different to that of the stop and turn and jumping / heading manoeuvre. Whereas for the rotational traction test the study showed that the rotation of the foot during the ST was substantially less than the minimum 45 ° required by the FIFA guidelines. Regarding the inclusion of in-game scenarios the study showed that both the simulated opponent used for the <b>stop</b> and turn <b>manoeuvre,</b> and heading a ball during a maximal vertical <b>stop</b> jump <b>manoeuvre</b> can affect the human movement dynamics. During the stop and turn with a simulated opponent the frontal plane moments in the lower limbs were significantly increased. However, this increase in joint loading could not be related to any changes in movement strategy. During the landing after heading a ball during a maximal vertical stop jump the players used a different landing strategy by landing in a more upright position and increasing the ankle plantar flexion ankle just before lading. This allowed for a larger change in the ankle plantar / dorsi flexion angle to absorb the impact of the landing. In addition to this, the heading manoeuvre also led to a significant increase in the frontal plane joint moments of the lower limbs. For future studies it is recommended that a combination of surface properties is used to gain insight into how these affect each other regarding the effects they have on human movement dynamics. In addition, they should provide detailed information on the surface design as well as the properties. Regarding the quantification of the properties it is recommended that in addition to industry standards the surfaces are also quantified using conditions closer to those expected within the study. It is also recommended that future studies incorporate in-game scenarios in order to gain more insight into the effects of interventions that simulate actual match situations...|$|R

40|$|MARINTEK's ship motion {{simulation}} program SIMAN (ShipX manoeuvring module) {{is used to}} develop a ship motion model for NTNU's research vessel R/V Gunnerus. SIMAN uses a 3 -DOF linear mathematical model to describe the vessel's motions. In order to verify the SIMAN model of R/V Gunnerus, full-scale trials of R/V Gunnerus were performed in deep water in Trondheimsfjorden. Turning circles, zig-zag- and stopping tests were carried out and analysed. Data was recorded using Seapath and the DP-system installed on R/V Gunnerus. Seapath registered data at 200 Hz, while the DP-system registered data at 1 Hz. Data registration at 1 Hz {{turned out to be}} too seldom, especially for the zig-zag manoeuvres. Full-scale trials are simulated in SIMAN. Measured full-scale results are compared with simulated results, and differences between measured and simulated results are identified. It was expected that differences would occur as SIMAN is developed for conventional vessels and offshore vessels, while R/V Gunnerus is an unconventional vessel (L= 28. 9 m, B= 9. 6 m). The deviations may be due to inaccurate field test results or errors in the modelling in SIMAN. SIMAN underestimated tactical diameter, transfer and advance in the turning circle manoeuvres. The difference increased with increasing rudder angle (and consequently drift angle), which may indicate errors in modelling of the non-linear damping forces. The damping forces are then modified using Oltmann's polynomial for the cross-flow drag coefficient for a tanker. This improved the results, all with the exception of transfer and advance at rudder angles of 20 degrees. It is also shown that the results are sensitive to rudder angle, so incorrect full-scale measurement will affect the results. The difference between measured and simulated zig-zag trials are significant. However, only a few seconds or degrees difference between the simulated and the measured zig-zag results cause a large percentage difference. Possible reasons for the differences are inadequate data registration of the full-scale trials, or errors in modelling in SIMAN. Overestimated results in SIMAN may indicate an unstable model. Increasing the models stability index by reducing Nv had a negligible effect on the simulated results. Decreasing rudder angle in the simulations improved the results. Track reach in the <b>stopping</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> are overestimated by SIMAN. This may be due to modelling issues as R/V Gunnerus is much smaller and responds faster than the vessels that SIMAN is developed for. In the literature there exists several empirical methods to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients used in manoeuvring equations. The hydrodynamic coefficients of R/V Gunnerus were calculated using approaches given by Wagner Smitt, Norrbin, Inoue, Clarke, Lee and Kijima, as well as using strip theory for a flat plate. Using these coefficients did not improve the simulated results. In order to create a complete motion model for R/V Gunnerus further investigation is necessary. It is recommended that PMM tests are performed to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients. It can also be useful to investigate the non-linear damping forces. In addition, new full-scale zig-zag tests should be performed in a way that 10 / 10 and 20 / 20 tests are obtained. Performing several reruns could be used to determine the precision errors of the full-scale trials. In the literature {{there is a need for}} vessels to be used for validation of simulation tools. R/V Gunnerus can be used as a case vessel to investigate how the simulation tools predict the manoeuvring performance of an unconventional vessel. The 26 th ITTC stated that there is a particular need for mathematical models for low speed manoeuvring, and vessels also used for validation of CFD-methods. R/V Gunnerus can be used as a case vessel for this research. It is then necessary to carry out tests intended for these purposes. </p...|$|R
30|$|Figure 12 {{shows that}} all the robots avoid two {{obstacles}} before they exit the operational region. There are differences in the path taken by the ground and aerial robots, though they follow the same direction. This {{is due to the}} inherent differences between a ground robot and an aerial robot. Ground robots are more stable and can turn in a stabilized manner, while the aerial robots need some time for stabilization after a turning manoeuvre. Once the distance to the obstacle detected is less than the critical distance, the robots perform a turning manoeuvre to avoid the obstacle. If the robot has moved 0.8  m from the point where a turning manoeuvre is initiated and if there is no obstacle detected, the robot <b>stops</b> the turning <b>manoeuvre</b> and moves forward in the same direction. The direction of the turn depends on the position of the obstacle in the robot’s path. If the robot senses that obstacle is located to its left, a right turn is performed and vice versa. This is the reason for different turning directions when the robots start from A and B, though the operational environment is symmetrical.|$|R

50|$|Again both fleets turned. And now {{something}} strange happened that has proven {{very difficult to}} explain. After the manoeuvre the English rear should obviously {{have been to the}} north of the centre. All sources agree however that it resulted in a reversed order of the English fleet in that the rearguard was now to the south of the centre. The traditional English solution to this riddle has been that their fleet tacked synchronously, i.e. each individual ship turned simultaneously to reverse fleet order, instead of turning one behind the other. If true that would have been a truly unique accomplishment for that age. Dutch sources suggest a different explanation: while executing the third turn the Dutch fleet lost all coherence because the wind suddenly turned to the southwest. It then slammed into the English van and centre. The English rear, avoiding the mass of confused ships, sailed behind the Dutch fleet to the south. A flotilla from the van then closed the trap completely, blocking the intended return to the Dutch coast. This scenario explains why all <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>stopped</b> and why some English flotillas clearly report trying to sail to the west, which would be inexplicable if they hadn't been to the east of the Dutch fleet.|$|R

40|$|A Driver Assistance System for Continuous Support {{continuously}} {{evaluates the}} status of the host vehicle as well as the surrounding traffic based on information from on-board sensors. When the system detects a hazard, it issues a warning to the driver, depending on the degree of the hazard. The effects of this system on driver behaviour and acceptance were evaluated in a field trial carried out in 2013. Twenty-four drivers took part in test drives with a within-subject design along a 53 km test route containing motorway and rural-road sections. Driving data was logged and the test drivers were observed by means of an in-car observation method (Wiener Fahrprobe); in this case by two observers in the car along with the driver. Questionnaires were used to assess the drivers’ comprehension of and reaction to the system. The system was successful in affecting driver behaviour in terms of lower speed when negotiating curves. Positive effects were found in the form of better speed adaptation to the situation during driving with the system activated. Also, lane choice and lane change improved with the system on. When it came to speed limit compliance, driving speed in general and longitudinal and lateral positioning, no effects could be found. No major differences were found regarding distance to the vehicle in front, overtaking <b>manoeuvres,</b> <b>stopping</b> behaviour at intersections, driving against yellow at traffic lights and interaction behaviour with other road users while driving with or without the system. On the negative side, it was noted that only during driving with the system activated did the test drivers make turns at intersections at too high speeds. In addition, more errors associated with dangerous distance to the side were observed with the system activated. In terms of the emotional state of the driver, the only difference found was that the drivers felt an increase in irritation. Regarding subjective workload, the drivers only assessed one item, i. e. whether their performance decreased statistically significantly while driving with the system. The test drivers were of the opinion that the system was useful, and that it would enhance safety especially in overtaking manoeuvres on motorways. The blind-spot warning was found especially useful in the overtaking process. The drivers appreciated the fact that the system did not give information all the time...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle crashes {{account for}} {{the highest number of}} {{fatalities}} for persons aged between 17 and 25 years of age in New Zealand. Despite a myriad of factors precipitating vehicle crashes, excess or inappropriate vehicle speed has been identified as the greatest predictor of crash likelihood and severity. Excess or inappropriate speed reduces a driver’s control over the vehicle, while exaggerating both collision force and the distances required in <b>stopping</b> or safely <b>manoeuvring.</b> One of the major differences identified between young and inexperienced and older more experienced drivers is the ability to adapt driving behaviour to road conditions. Young drivers are more prone to speeding through both a lack of awareness of risks and a desire to seek out novel and stimulating experiences. Recent developments in cognitive models of risk taking propose that older more experienced drivers may adapt their speed by “feeling out” the road conditions, where as young drivers may depend more upon posted limits to determine their speed. A video speed task was developed to measure speed preferences on a selection of road conditions (or ‘environments’) commonly confronting New Zealand motorists. Analyses of speed preferences revealed that young and inexperienced drivers preferred speeds close to the road-limit irrespective of conditions, whereas older and more experienced drivers preferred speeds clearly below the road limit, and demonstrated greater variation in speed preferences on different road environments. This suggests that young and inexperienced drivers both prefer faster speeds and may use the road limit as a target in determining an appropriate speed. Older and more experienced drivers prefer slower speeds, and adapt driving to changing road conditions. Faster preferred speeds were found to be related to a riskier attitudes towards driving in general, and more lenient attitudes toward speeding in particular. In addition, faster preferred speeds were found to be related to a heightened enjoyment of risk taking, as well as the number of speeding convictions issued in the previous 12 months. The used video speed task provided a convenient measure of speeding behaviour in natural driving scenarios, and appeared to be sensitive to differences in the way drivers adjust their behaviour across changing driving conditions. The video speed task might be useful in determining differences in speed choice between day and night time driving scenarios, as well as expanding the road conditions to including wet or foggy driving situations. This may be particularly useful in determining the pre- and post-effectiveness of driver training programs...|$|R

It was given him mainly {{for the part}} he played, and for the success he achieved in the Wood's patent agitation. He was acclaimed the champion of the people, because he had <b>stopped</b> the foolish <b>manoeuvres</b> of the Walpole Administration. So to label him, however, would be to do him an injustice. In truth, he would have championed the cause of liberty and justice in any country in which he lived, had he found liberty and justice wanting there. The matter of the copper coinage patent was but a peg for him to hang arguments which applied almost everywhere. It was not to the particular arguments but to the spirit which gave them life that we must look for the true value of Swift's work. And that spirit--honest, brave, strong for the right--is even more abundantly displayed in the writings we have just considered. They witness to his championship of liberty and justice, to his impeachment of selfish office-holders and a short-sighted policy. They gave him his position as the chief among the citizens of Dublin to whom he spoke as counsel and adviser. They proclaim him as the friend of the common people, to whom {{he was more than}} the Dean of St. Patrick's. He may have begun his work impelled by a hatred for Whiggish principles; but he undoubtedly accomplished it in the spirit of a broad-minded and far-seeing statesman. The pressing needs of Ireland were too urgent and crying for him to permit his personal dislike of the Irish natives to divert him from his humanitarian efforts. If he hated the beggar he was ready with his charity. The times in which he lived were not times in which, as he told the freemen of Dublin, [...] "to expect such an exalted degree of virtue from mortal men." [...] He was speaking to them of the impossibility of office-holders being independent of the government under which they held their offices. [...] "Blazing stars," [...] he said, [...] "are much more frequently seen than such heroical virtues." [...] As the Irish people were governed by such men he advised them strongly to choose a parliamentary representative from among themselves. He insisted on the value of their collected voice, their unanimity of effort, a consciousness of their understanding of what they wished to bring about. [...] "Be independent" [...] is the text of all his writings to the people of Ireland. It is idle to appeal to England's clemency or England's justice. It is vain to evolve social schemes and Utopian dreams. The remedy lay in their own hands, if the people only realized it.|$|R
