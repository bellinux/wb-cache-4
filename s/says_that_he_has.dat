5|$|Coghill {{received}} his first drum {{at the age}} of 14, which was a Pearl drum kit given to him by his parents. In 1999, Coghill noted that he began using a 1970 Slingerland drum kit, citing that it had a better sound than a new kit, and was cheaper. Coghill uses Avedis Zildjian cymbals. He <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been offered sponsorship, but opted for older drums as a matter of preference. Despite this assertion, as of 2007 Coghill's name is mentioned in the Brady Drums artist roster.|$|E
5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius {{did not get the}} tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, the wording of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.|$|E

5|$|Thereafter Asser {{seems to}} have divided his time between Wales and Alfred's court. Asser gives no {{information}} about his time in Wales, but mentions various places that he visited in England, including the battlefield at Ashdown, Cynuit (Countisbury), and Athelney. It is evident from Asser's account that he {{spent a good deal}} of time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh (who is not the same Eadburh who died as a beggar in Pavia), on many occasions; and <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> often seen Alfred hunting.|$|E
5|$|With this information, Maida, Sakera, and Kuan {{approach}} Muchlisin {{and tell}} him how the house features in his history. After a short silence, Muchlisin tells them to leave.

Instead, he renovates the building and dedicates it as a school for street children.|$|E

5|$|In Jötunheimr, the jötunn Þrymr {{sits on a}} barrow, {{plaiting}} golden collars for {{his female}} dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. Þrymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the Æsir and the elves; why is Loki alone in Jötunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the Æsir—that Thor's hammer, Mjöllnir, is gone. Þrymr <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> hidden Mjöllnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved, but only if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from Jötunheimr {{and back to the}} court of the gods.|$|E
5|$|KCDC wakes JTRO, {{having taken}} him to the 248 headquarters. After JTRO's recovery, BLT takes him and KCDC shooting; they decide to take guns to JTRO's match against L Dubba E. Stacy tells JTRO that her {{relationship}} with L Dubba E began when he spiked her drink with turpentine and raped her.

After a brief fight with him, JTRO persuades Stacy to leave. Immediately after their departure, L Dubba E arrives and <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been cheating on Stacy. Stacy decides to stay with him, which angers JTRO and causes him to end their friendship.|$|E
5|$|Sameer {{decides to}} leave Goa, and Sunny taunts {{him that he}} got close to Rani through Sameer's mistakes. Sameer <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> had enough dreaming, and wishes Sunny happiness. Sunny taunts Sameer again, and Sameer loses his temper. He chases Sunny through the crowd at a cricket stadium where India and Pakistan are playing a {{friendly}} match. Sameer breaks through security, takes the microphone from guest of honour Kapil Dev and apologises to Rani and her parents. He asks {{her to marry him}} in front of the crowd, and Rani runs onto the field and embraces him, thus reuniting with him.|$|E

5|$|Suharto is soon {{called to}} the {{secondary}} palace in Bogor to speak with Sukarno. There, the president <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> received assurances from Air Marshal Omar Dani that the Air Force was not involved. Suharto refutes the statement, noting that the movement's arms were {{like those of the}} Air Force. The meeting eventually results in Suharto being confirmed as leader of the Army, working together with Pranoto Reksosamodra. In their investigation of the events, the Army discovers the camp at Lubang Buaya– including the generals' bodies, which are recovered while Suharto delivers a speech describing the coup and the PKI's role in it. The generals are interred elsewhere and Suharto delivers a hagiographic eulogy in which he condemns the G30S and PKI and urges the Indonesian people to continue the fallen generals' struggle.|$|E
5|$|Phantom Blood begins {{during an}} ancient Aztec ritual, {{where a man}} splatters a sacrifice's blood onto the stone mask he wears. It shoots hooks into his skull, and he <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> become immortal. In England in 1880, a boy named Dio Brando is adopted by the wealthy Joestar family {{following}} Dio's father Dario's death; this was done as thanks under the mistaken belief that Dario had saved George Joestar and his newborn son Jonathan during a stagecoach accident twelve years prior, when Dario had in reality only been attempting to loot corpses. Intending to inherit the Joestar fortune, Dio presents himself to George as a gentleman, while also bullying Jonathan, using violence, incinerating Jonathan's dog Danny, and forcefully kissing Erina Pendleton, Jonathan's girlfriend. During a fight between Jonathan and Dio, some blood touches the stone mask – now owned by George – leading Dio to learn how it works.|$|E
5|$|E.P. Arnold Royalton, {{owner of}} {{conglomerate}} Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle {{in exchange for}} signing to race with him. Speed is tempted but declines due to his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have been fixed by corporate interests, including Royalton himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of a corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000. Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Inspector Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.|$|E

5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E

Veronica talks to Dick, who {{presents}} a different account of events, saying that he didn't drug her and that he found Beaver with Veronica already. Veronica approaches Beaver, who gives a set of events more {{similar to that of}} Sean. However, after Dick and Sean leave, he purports to have run away and vomited before he could bring himself to rape her. Keith <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to leave for an engagement in Vegas. Logan talks to Aaron, but Aaron does not even know Logan's birth date. Veronica talks to Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester), who says that she saw Veronica having sex with Duncan. Veronica confronts Duncan, who denies the rape accusations and remembers comforting Veronica in her drugged state. Duncan says that the sex was consensual even though he knew that they were siblings, confirming Veronica's fears. Veronica talks to Wallace about the events but says that she is content with the answers she has. Keith calls a prostitute in Vegas for an unknown reason, while Veronica apologizes to Logan and tells her about the situation with Duncan. Back in Vegas, Keith talks to the prostitute, Cheyenne, about Abel Koontz, as Cheyenne and Koontz were together at the time of Lilly's murder. Veronica and Logan go into his darkened house before they realize that Aaron throws a surprise party for him, meaning that virtually the entire high school knows that they are dating.|$|E
