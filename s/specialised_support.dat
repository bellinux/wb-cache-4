50|$|This article {{does not}} provide an {{exhaustive}} description of every possible variation or extension of the Rete algorithm. Other considerations and innovations exist. For example, engines may provide <b>specialised</b> <b>support</b> within the Rete network in order to apply pattern-matching rule processing to specific data types and sources such as programmatic objects, XML data or relational data tables. Another example concerns additional time-stamping facilities provided by many engines for each WME entering a Rete network, {{and the use of}} these time-stamps in conjunction with conflict resolution strategies. Engines exhibit significant variation in the way they allow programmatic access to the engine and its working memory, and may extend the basic Rete model to support forms of parallel and distributed processing.|$|E

Facio can also visualise results of FMO calculations, such as the pair interactions.|$|E
