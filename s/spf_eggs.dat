40|$|Abstract Background The use of Specific Pathogen Free (<b>SPF)</b> <b>eggs</b> in {{combination}} with RCAS retrovirus, {{a member of the}} Avian Sarcoma-Leukosis Virus (ASLV) family, is of standard practice to study gene function and development. <b>SPF</b> <b>eggs</b> are certified free of infection by specific pathogen viruses of either exogenous or endogenous origin, including those belonging to the ASLV family. Based on this, SPF embryos are considered to be free of ASLV viral protein expression, and consequently in developmental research studies RCAS infected cells are routinely identified by immunohistochemistry against the ASLV viral proteins p 19 and p 27. Contrary to this generally accepted notion, observations in our laboratory suggested that certified SPF chicken embryos may endogenously express ASLV viral proteins p 19 and p 27. Since these observations may have significant implications for the developmental research field we further investigated this possibility. Results We demonstrate that certified SPF chicken embryos have transcriptionally active endogenous ASLV loci (ev loci) capable of expressing ASLV viral proteins, such as p 19 and p 27, even when those loci are not capable of producing viral particles. We also show that the extent of viral protein expression in embryonic tissues varies not only among flocks but also between embryos of the same flock. In addition, our genetic screening revealed significant heterogeneity in ev loci composition even among embryos of the same flock. Conclusions These observations have critical implications for the developmental biology research field, since they strongly suggest that the current standard methodology used in experimental studies using the chick embryo and RCAS vectors may lead to inaccurate interpretation of results. Retrospectively, our observations suggest that studies in which infected cells have been identified simply by pan-ASLV viral protein expression may need to be considered with caution. For future studies, they point to a need for careful selection and screening of the chick SPF lines to be used {{in combination}} with RCAS constructs, as well as the methodology utilized for qualitative analysis of experimental results. A series of practical guidelines to ensure research quality animals and accuracy of the interpretation of results is recommended and discussed. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) {{can cause}} high mortality, poor weight gain and low feed {{efficiency}} of infected chickens, which leading to considerable economic losses to the poultry industry. In this study, a plasmid DNA pTracer-CVM 2 -IBVS (abbr: pCMV-S) that expresses the immunogenic S glycoprotein genes of IBV serotype Massachusetts 41 was inoculated in ovo into 18 -days-old embryonating Specific-Pathogen-Free (<b>SPF)</b> chicken <b>eggs</b> as a vaccine. Recombinant chicken interferon type I alpha (rChIFN-") was added as an adjuvant {{to enhance the}} immunogenicity of the vaccine. After hatch, birds were challenged at 4 weeks of age with a homologous pathogenic Massachusetts 41 field type IBV. Birds receiving a single dose of pCMV-S vaccine in ovo showed mild clinical signs and were protected {{at the level of}} 66 %, whereas groups receiving a combination of the pCMV-S with 2000 IU or 500 IU of rChIFN- " showed protection at the level of 83 and 89 % respectively. The pCMV-S + 500 IU rChIFN- " vaccinated group, when boosted with a live attenuated commercial IBV vaccine at 2 weeks of age indicated a significant protection (> 92 %) against IBV challenge. At 5 days post challenge, no clinical signs were seen from the birds vaccinated with 5 ug of pCMV-S + 500 IU rChIFN and the birds received booster with commercial IBV vaccine. RT-PCR based diagnostic test indicated detecting IBV infection was reduced in birds received pCMV-S with 2000 IU or 500 IU of rCHIFN-".

40|$|Newcastle disease virus (NDV) edits its P-gene mRNA by {{inserting}} a nontemplated G residue(s) at a conserved editing site (3 ′-UUUUUCCC-template strand). In the wild-type virus, three amino-coterminal P-gene-derived proteins, P, V, and W, are produced at frequencies of approximately 68, 29, and 2 %, respectively. By applying the reverse genetics technique, editing-defective mutants were generated in cell culture. Compared to the wild-type virus, mutants lacking either six nucleotides of the conserved editing site or the unique C-terminal {{part of the}} V protein produced as much as 5, 000 -fold fewer infectious progeny in vitro or 200, 000 -fold fewer in 6 -day-old embryonated chicken eggs. In addition, both mutants were unable to propagate in 9 - to 11 -day-old embryonated specific-pathogen-free (<b>SPF)</b> chicken <b>eggs.</b> In contrast, a mutant (NDV-P 1) with one nucleotide substitution (UUCUUCCC) grew in eggs, albeit with a 100 -fold-lower infectious titer than the parent virus. The modification {{in the first two}} mutants described above led to complete abolition of V expression, whereas in NDV-P 1 the editing frequency was reduced to less than 2 %, and as a result, V was expressed at a 20 -fold-lower level. NDV-P 1 showed markedly attenuated pathogenicity for SPF chicken embryos, unlike currently available ND vaccine strains. These findings indicate that the V protein of NDV has a dual function, playing a direct role in virus replication as well as serving as a virulence factor. Administration of NDV-P 1 to 18 -day-old embryonated chicken eggs hardly affected hatchability. Hatched chickens developed high levels of NDV-specific antibodies and were fully protected against lethal challenge, demonstrating the potential use of editing-defective recombinant NDV as a safe embryo vaccine...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Newcastle disease (ND) is an infectious, highly {{contagious}} {{and destructive}} viral disease of poultry {{and controlled by}} vaccination. In spite of vaccination, incidence of ND was reported in commercial layers with gastrointestinal lesions. This study was undertaken to assess the prevalence and pathotypes of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) involved in gastrointestinal tract abnormalities of vaccinated commercial layer chicken of Namakkal region {{for a period of}} three years from 2008 and 2011. Materials and Methods: Pooled tissue (trachea, lung, spleen, proventriculus, intestine and caecal tonsils) samples collected from dead birds on postmortem examination from 100 layer flocks above 20 weeks of age with gastrointestinal lesions were subjected to isolation of NDV in embryonated specific pathogen free (<b>SPF)</b> chicken <b>eggs.</b> Mean death time (MDT) and intracerebral pathogenicity index of the isolates were characterized. Flock details were collected from NDV positive flocks to assess the prevalence and impact of NDV on vaccinated commercial layer chicken. Results: Among the 100 flocks examined Newcastle disease virus was detected in 14 flocks as a single infection and 10 flocks as combined infections with worm infestation, necrotic enteritis and coccidiosis. Chicken embryo mean death time (MDT) and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) values ranged from 50. 4 to 96. 0 hrs and from 0. 650 to 1. 675 respectively. Affected birds showed anorexia, diarrohea and drop in egg production. Macropathologically, matting of vent feathers, petechial haemorrhage on the tip of proventricular papilla, caecal tonsils and degeneration of ovarian follicles were noticed. The incidence of ND was most commonly noticed in 20 - 50 wk of age and between the months of September to November. Morbidity rate varied from 5...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a la Fifth ESWI Influenza Conference, celebrada en Riga (Latvia) del 14 al 17 de septiembre de 2014. Anseriformes and Charadriiformes {{are known}} to be the main {{reservoirs}} for Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) in which the transmission within these occurs via faecal/oral contact in contaminated water. Understanding the Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) persistence and transmission dynamics is crucial for predicting disease outbreaks and improving surveillance strategies. The aim of this work was to monitor the presence and persistence of AIV in its natural environment in relation to ecology of its reservoir hosts. During a 23 month period (March 2012 -January 2014) the relationship between AIV presence and wildfowl population movements was studied in a small wetland in the north of Spain where the presence of different AIV had previously been recorded. This water ecosystem is considered of special interest as it is an important site for wintering and breeding of waterfowl and as a stopover for waterfowl migrating further south, being considerably small (209 Ha) and close to an urbanised area. Fresh faeces were collected monthly from islets scattered along the wetland, used as roosting sites by the birds. Bird censuses and meteorological data were gathered in parallel in order to relate AIV detection to waterfowl ecology. For AIV detection RNA was extracted from the faecal matter and analysed by influenza A specific rRT-PCR. Positive samples were then tested for H 5 and H 7 subtypes and inoculated into embrionated <b>SPF</b> chicken <b>eggs</b> for virus isolation. During the 23 months, a total of 2096 samples were analysed and AIV was detected in 0. 29...|$|R
40|$|Fibromatosis in hares has {{not been}} {{reported}} in Northern Italy since 1961 (Leinati and others 1961). After 40 years, in the same geographic area an outbreak of fibromatosis in reared game hares occurred. Two hundred and fifty (25 %) of animals examined showed typical skin lesions with no difference in prevalence related to the age. Skin tumours of 1 to 3 cm in diameter were present on the legs and ears. After 4 - 6 weeks the skin lesions disappeared and the animals spontaneously recovered. Histologically many large cells with large nuclei and numerous periodic acid-Schiff inclusion bodies in their abundant cytoplasm were observed. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of poxviruses. The virus produced typical pocks on the chorion-allantoic membrane of <b>SPF</b> embrionated chicken <b>eggs,</b> but no cytopathic effect on a continous line of rabbit kidney cells (RK 13). Cross-infection trials and serological examinations of challenged rabbits, hares and cottontails were carried out {{but none of the}} animals developed the disease and none of the sera examined contained antibodies against myxoma virus...|$|R
