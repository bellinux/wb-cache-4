25|$|Salam had a {{prolific}} research career in theoretical and high-energy physics. Salam {{had worked on}} theory of the neutrino – an elusive particle that was first postulated by Wolfgang Pauli in the 1930s. Salam introduced chiral symmetry {{in the theory of}} neutrinos. The introduction of chiral symmetry played crucial role in subsequent development of the theory of electroweak interactions. Salam later passed his work to Riazuddin, who made pioneering contributions in neutrinos. Salam introduced the massive Higgs bosons to the theory of the Standard Model, where he later predicted the existence of proton decay. In 1963, Salam published his theoretical work on the vector meson. The paper introduced the interaction of vector meson, photon (vector electrodynamics), and the renormalisation of vector mesons' known mass after the interaction. In 1961, Salam began to work with John Clive Ward on symmetries and electroweak unification. In 1964, Salam and Ward worked on a Gauge theory for the weak and electromagnetic interaction, subsequently obtaining SU(2) × U(1) model. Salam was convinced that all the elementary particle interactions are actually the gauge interactions. In 1968, together with Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, Salam formulated the mathematical concept of their work. While in Imperial College, Salam, along with Glashow and Jeffrey Goldstone, mathematically proved the Goldstone's theorem, that a massless spin-zero object must appear in a theory as a result of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>breaking</b> of a continuous global symmetry. In 1960, Salam and Weinberg incorporated the Higgs mechanism into Glashow's discovery, giving it a modern form in electroweak theory, and thus theorised the Standard Model. In 1968, together with Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, Salam finally formulated the mathematical concept of their work.In 1966, Salam carried out pioneering work on a hypothetical particle. Salam showed the possible electromagnetic interaction between the Magnetic monopole and the C-violation, thus he formulated the magnetic photon.|$|E

40|$|I {{present a}} new form of {{spontaneous}} CP violation in which, in analogy with the left-right-symmetric model, CP breaking results from the inequality of two real vacuum expectation values. In my model there is no scalar-pseudoscalar mixing, and the smallness of strong CP violation finds a natural explanation. There exist in the literature models of <b>spontaneous</b> P <b>breaking</b> and models of <b>spontaneous</b> CP <b>breaking.</b> Amazingly, the models of <b>spontaneous</b> P <b>breaking</b> are very different from the models of <b>spontaneous</b> CP <b>breaking.</b> The usual model of <b>spontaneous</b> P <b>breaking</b> is the left-right-symmetric model [1]. In it, the standardmodel gauge group SU(2) L is duplicated with a new gauge group SU(2) R, which acts on the right-handed fermions. The idea is that there are right-handed charged weak interactions, but they are mediated by gauge bosons W ± R which are much heavier than the known W ±. The basic models of <b>spontaneous</b> CP <b>breaking</b> [2, 3] are utterly 1 different. In them, no extra gauge group is introduced, and there are no extra wea...|$|R

2500|$|At first, these seminal {{papers on}} <b>spontaneous</b> <b>breaking</b> of gauge symmetries were largely ignored, {{because it was}} widely {{believed}} that the (non-Abelian gauge) theories in question were a dead-end, and in particular {{that they could not}} be renormalised. In 1971–72, Martinus Veltman and Gerard 't Hooft proved renormalisation of Yang–Mills was possible in two papers covering massless, and then massive, fields. Their contribution, and the work of others on the renormalisation group – including [...] "substantial" [...] theoretical work by Russian physicists Ludvig Faddeev, Andrei Slavnov, Efim Fradkin, and Igor Tyutin – was eventually [...] "enormously profound and influential", [...] but even with all key elements of the eventual theory published there was still almost no wider interest. For example, Coleman found in a study that [...] "essentially no-one paid any attention" [...] to Weinberg's paper prior to 1971 and discussed by David Politzer in his 2004 Nobel speech. – now the most cited in particle physics [...] – and even in 1970 according to Politzer, Glashow's teaching of the weak interaction contained no mention of Weinberg's, Salam's, or Glashow's own work. In practice, Politzer states, almost everyone learned of the theory due to physicist Benjamin Lee, who combined the work of Veltman and 't Hooft with insights by others, and popularised the completed theory. In this way, from 1971, interest and acceptance [...] "exploded" [...] and the ideas were quickly absorbed in the mainstream.|$|E
