30|$|Superconductors {{have found}} {{widespread}} applications ranging from civil to military uses. The superconductor-based Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique {{used in many}} hospitals, the <b>superconducting</b> <b>super-collider</b> project in Texas USA, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in CERN, the ITER project, the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokomak (EAST) in China and so on are all examples where superconductors are necessary materials. Another important application is the superconducting magnetic levitation system, which not only saves much of the electrical energy but also saves the space and weight of the vehicle and dramatically increases its speed [1]. Such important applications require deeper and exact understanding of the properties, e.g. mechanical and critical ones, of a superconductor.|$|E
