25|$|The {{device was}} {{introduced}} to Cornwall in January 1842, following the award of a premium for the best design, by the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society. The winner, Michael Loam, built one for the proprietors of the Tresavean Mine, in Lanner near Redruth. He used a double-rod design, driven by a waterwheel. In October of that year Loam proposed that the water wheel {{be replaced by a}} steam engine. A 36-inch bore, 6-foot stroke, double-action steam engine was employed, through reduction <b>spur</b> <b>gearing</b> of 5:1. At the same time the stroke of the man-engine beams was increased from 6feet to 12. Coal consumption was 24hundredweight (1,200kg) per day; the engine was in use for only six hours a day, but the boiler was kept at operating temperature continuously. The miners' journey time (in either direction) was reduced from about an hour to twenty-four minutes and output per shift increased by one fifth.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{electric}} locomotives, {{like their}} Diesel-electric counterparts, almost universally use axle-hung traction motors, with one motor for each powered axle. In this arrangement, {{one side of}} the motor housing is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle. The other side of the housing has a tongue-shaped protuberance that engages a matching slot in the truck (bogie) bolster, its purpose being to act as a torque reaction device, as well as a support. Power transfer from motor to axle is effected by <b>spur</b> <b>gearing,</b> in which a pinion on the motor shaft engages a bull gear on the axle. Both gears are enclosed in a liquid-tight housing containing lubricating oil. The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed. Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units, whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To {{enhance the}} {{mobility}} of combat tracked vehicles, a high-powered compact power pack is crucial. To achieve this goal, it is planned to apply the concept of high-contact-ratio (HCR) gearing to an independent final-drive planetary gear assembly of the tracked vehicle transmission. Before applying the concept to the final-drive, the performances of both normal-contact-ratio (NCR) and HCR conventional parallel shaft <b>spur</b> <b>gearing</b> systems are evaluated and compared. The results show that, for the same torque, HCR gears are subjected to lower loads and endure almost double the life of NCR gears. This reveals that an HCR gear can transmit more power for the same size. Furthermore, the power loss, vibration, and noise level of the HCR gearing are significantly {{lower than those of}} the NCR gearing. The proven results of the case study have encouraged the replacement of the existing NCR gearing with the HCR gearing for the final-drive planetary assembly of the combat tracked vehicle for evaluation...|$|E

Dynamic loads on high contact ratio spur gears are calculated by using {{an analytical}} model based on torsional vibration of gears. Dynamic load variations during a mesh cycle of a tooth are determined. Variable stiffnesses of gear teeth which are required for dynamic load calculations are found by using analytical expressions. Bending, shear, axial compression and Hertzian contact deflections are considered for tooth stiffness calculation. Viscous damping and friction among the mating teeth are also included in this analysis. Contact stresses are calculated by using analytical expressions developed for two elastic bodies held in contact by forces normal to the area of contact and accompanied by tangential frictional force. Contact stress variations during a mesh cycle of a tooth are determined. It is found that the operating speed has a significant influence on the dynamic load acting on the gear tooth.
