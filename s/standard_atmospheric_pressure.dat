25|$|One key {{advance in}} the Kestrel {{was the use of}} a {{pressurised}} cooling system. Water boils at 100°C at <b>standard</b> <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure,</b> but this temperature decreases with altitude. Since the amount of heat carried out of the engine is a function of coolant temperature and volume, the coolant has to be kept below boiling point and an increasing amount of fluid has to be used, along with an increasingly large radiator to cool it. The solution was to pressurise the entire cooling system, thereby not only preventing the decrease in cooling performance with altitude, but in fact increasing the boiling point even on the ground. The Kestrel was built to maintain enough pressure to keep the boiling point at about 150°C.|$|E

The apparent kinetic efficiency, Jmax/p 50, increased from the resting to the active state, despite the decrease of oxygen affinity, 1 /p 50. Consequently, the relative increase of respiratory flux by ADP activation, expressed as the adenylate control ratio, declined under hypoxia, {{but not to the}} extreme of a complete loss of the scope for activation, which would occur at constant Jmax/p 50.

40|$|The {{universal}} scaling {{concept is}} applied to the low-temperature range of any liquid states and substances located between the melting (Tm) and normal boiling (Tb) points far away from the critical region. The physical reason to develop such approach is the revealed collapse of all low-temperature isotherms onto the single universal one argued by the model of fluctuational thermodynamics (FT) proposed recently by author. The pressure reduced by the molecular parameters of the effective short-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential depends here only on the reduced density. To demonstrate the extraordinary predictive abilities of the developed low-temperature scaling model it has been applied to the prediction of equilibrium and transport (kinetic and dynamic viscosity, self-diffusion, and thermal conductivity) properties not only for molecular liquids but also for molten organic salts termed ionic liquids (ILs). The best argument in favor of the proposed methodology is the appropriate consistency with the scarce experiments prediction of transport coefficients for ILs on the base of universal scaling function constructed for the simplest LJ-like liquid argon. The only input data of any substance for prediction are the linear approximations of T-dependent density and isobaric heat capacity taken from the <b>standard</b> measurements at <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure...</b>|$|R
