5|$|The {{history of}} Poland from 1945 to 1989 spans {{the period of}} Soviet {{communist}} dominance imposed {{after the end of}} World War II over what had become the Polish People's Republic. These years, while featuring general industrialization and urbanization and many improvements in the standard of living in Poland, were marred by social unrest and <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> difficulties.|$|E
5|$|By 2009 {{some of the}} {{conditions}} required for a currency war had returned, with a <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> downturn seeing global trade in that year decline by about 12%. There was a widespread concern among advanced economies {{about the size of}} their deficits; they increasingly joined emerging economies in viewing export led growth as their ideal strategy. In March 2009, even before international co-operation reached its peak with the 2009 G-20 London Summit , economist Ted Truman {{became one of the first}} to warn of the dangers of competitive devaluation. He also coined the phrase competitive non-appreciation.|$|E
5|$|Having {{achieved}} {{stability in}} the West, Alexios could turn {{his attention to the}} <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> difficulties and the disintegration of the Empire's traditional defences. However, he still did not have enough manpower to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor and to advance against the Seljuks. At the Council of Piacenza in 1095, envoys from Alexios spoke to Pope Urban II about the suffering of the Christians of the East, and underscored that without help from the West they would continue to suffer under Muslim rule.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} impact of a BSE outbreak on the US economy is modeled in input-output setting using 2002 US IMPLAN data. An outbreak of BSE would hurt the US beef industry, other agriculturally-related industry, {{and the rest of}} the economy as a whole. The worse effects occur in the beef cattle and farming industries. Generally, the economy of every county would be hurt given the fact that cattle are produced in all the 50 states. But it is apparent that the damage would be substantial in those regions and households which already suffer the <b>severest</b> <b>economic</b> damage. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
25|$|In many regions, {{more than}} 75% of the topsoil {{was blown away}} {{by the end of}} the 1930s. Land {{degradation}} varied widely. Aside from the short-term economic consequences caused by erosion, there were <b>severe</b> long-term <b>economic</b> consequences caused by the Dust Bowl.|$|R
50|$|Worker {{remittances}} {{and foreign}} aid have softened the subsequent volatile recovery period. GDP has increased each year except in 2001, rising by 5% in 2000. However, growth in 1999 was held {{down by the}} <b>severe</b> regional <b>economic</b> dislocations caused by the Kosovo war.|$|R
5|$|The Icelandic {{financial}} crisis {{was a major}} economic and political event in Iceland that involved the default of {{all three of the}} country's major privately owned commercial banks in late 2008, following their difficulties in refinancing their short-term debt and a run on deposits in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Relative to the size of its economy, Iceland's systemic banking collapse was the largest experienced by any country in economic history. The crisis led to a <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> depression in 2008–2010 and significant political unrest.|$|E
5|$|This policy, {{known as}} malgachization, {{coincided with a}} <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> {{downturn}} and a dramatic decline {{in the quality of}} education. Those schooled during this period generally failed to master the French language or many other subjects and struggled to find employment, forcing many to take low-paying jobs in the informal or black market that mired them in deepening poverty. Excepting the brief presidency of Albert Zafy, from 1992 to 1996, Ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in education throughout his tenure.|$|E
5|$|With {{stability}} at last {{achieved in}} the west, Alexios now {{had a chance to}} begin solving his <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> difficulties and the disintegration of the empire's traditional defences. In order to reestablish the army, Alexios began to build a new force on the basis of feudal grants (próniai) and prepared to advance against the Seljuks, who had conquered Asia Minor and were now established at Nicaea.|$|E
50|$|Lex Luthor {{has been}} elected President of United States during a <b>severe</b> {{nationwide}} <b>economic</b> depression. Under his leadership, the economy begins to thrive, and he assembles a force of government-employed superheroes consisting of Captain Atom, Katana, Black Lightning, Power Girl, Starfire, and Major Force. Superman and Batman maintain their distrust toward Luthor.|$|R
40|$|The Japanese economy, {{especially}} local economy, has stagnated continuously {{after the}} 1990 's. The rapid progress of globalization, the yen's sharp rise, the declining birthrate and aging population {{are considered to}} inflict local economy and industry <b>severer</b> <b>economic</b> environment from now on. In such current economic climate, this paper is aiming to seek appropriate revitalization measures of stagnating local economy. To this end, taking Nagasaki prefecture as an example, {{the current status of}} local economy and industry is overviewed and existing measures for promotion executed by the local administration and their future challenges are examined. Then, the effective measures to promote innovation of local SMEs by the faculty of business administration of local university are examined based on recent research outcomes on the innovation of SMEs and several activities which have been already carried out and future challenges is described...|$|R
25|$|In 1348, the Black Death, locally {{known as}} A Mortaldade, reached the ports of Galicia, decimating the population, and causing a <b>severe</b> and lasting <b>economic</b> crisis.|$|R
5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do paid work in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E
5|$|Political {{tensions}} {{amongst the}} working classes in Glamorgan had grown during the 1820s: although wages were impressive by contemporary standards during good years, they deteriorated quickly during depressions, plunging many into destitution; sanitation and health {{standards in the}} fast-growing industrial communities were appalling, child mortality rates were extremely high. 1831 saw a <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> depression, with wages falling quickly and food prices rising, and complaints against the local debt courts and their bailiffs were numerous. Nationally, the electoral reform movement was making considerable protests and protests against the Corn Laws—which kept the prices of food high—were growing. In South Wales, several of the major ironmasters were associated with these movements, promoting reform under the Whig administration voted into power between April and June 1831.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} of the monumental {{statue of the}} authoritarian leader Enver Hohxa in Gjirokastër {{by members of the}} local Greek community in August 1991 marked the end of the one-party state. Gjirokastër suffered <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> problems following the end of communist rule in 1991. In the spring of 1993, the region of Gjirokastër became a center of open conflict between Greek minority members and the Albanian police. The city was particularly affected by the 1997 collapse of a massive pyramid scheme which destabilised the entire Albanian economy. The city became the focus of a rebellion against the government of Sali Berisha; violent anti-government protests took place which eventually forced Berisha's resignation. On 16 December 1997, Hoxha's house was damaged by unknown attackers, but subsequently restored.|$|E
50|$|In 1982 {{during the}} <b>severe</b> {{worldwide}} <b>economic</b> depression, {{there were over}} 30,000 consumer bankruptcies in Canada, a 33% increase over the previous year. The bankruptcy rate began to fall from 1983 to 1985 as the economy strengthened. For the period 1980 through 1985, bankruptcies per 1,000 businesses in Canada peaked at 50% above the 1980 rate.|$|R
50|$|The first ‘Indian Indians’ to {{have arrived}} in Peru were {{businessmen}} {{who had gone}} there in the early 1960s. Later on, the community grew in number marginally until the early 80s, after which many of its members left due to the <b>severe</b> local <b>economic</b> crises and the prevailing terrorism. Those with relatives in other Latin countries joined them.|$|R
50|$|Britain thought {{disarmament}} {{was the key}} to peace. France, {{with its}} profound fear of German militarism, strenuously opposed the idea. In the early 1930s, most Britons saw France, not Germany, as the chief threat to peace and harmony in Europe. France did not suffer as <b>severe</b> an <b>economic</b> recession, and was the strongest military power, but still it refused British overtures for disarmament.|$|R
5|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{had a serious}} negative impact on the Icelandic economy. The national currency fell sharply in value, foreign currency transactions were virtually suspended for weeks, and the market capitalisation of the Icelandic stock exchange fell by more than 90%. As a result of the crisis, Iceland underwent a <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> depression; the country's gross domestic product dropped by 10% in real terms between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2010. A new era with positive GDP growth started in 2011, and has helped foster a gradually declining trend for the unemployment rate. The government budget deficit has declined from 9.7% of GDP in 2009 and 2010 to 0.2% of GDP in 2014; the central government gross debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline to less than 60% in 2018 from a maximum of 85% in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Throughout much of {{the twentieth}} century, Venezuela was beset by political, civil and {{military}} unrest. After Juan Vicente Gómez's long reign as president ended in 1935, a series of military rulers followed, concluding with Marcos Pérez Jiménez's overthrow by general uprising in 1958. Although the military remained influential, Venezuela's government has since been chosen by civilians through democratic processes. Until 1998, the dominant political parties were Acción Democrática and COPEI, who shared seven presidencies between them. In 1989, during the second term in office for Acción Democrática's Carlos Andrés Pérez, Venezuela {{was hit by a}} <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> crisis. A wave of protests known as the Caracazo engulfed the country and dozens were killed in rioting.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill had}} a more {{difficult}} time in the Senate. The National Association of Manufacturers, Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist Henry Ford all opposed its passage. Senator Bennett Champ Clark introduced an amendment to emasculate Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator George W. Norris led the successful opposition to the change. The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of antitrust law. Senators William E. Borah, Burton K. Wheeler, and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, arguing that this would exacerbate existing <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> inequality and concentrate wealth {{in the hands of}} the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression). Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion of codes of fair trade practices would help create progressive standards for wages, hours, and working conditions, and eliminate sweatshops and child labor. The Senate passed the amended legislation 57-to-24 on June 9.|$|E
50|$|Indians in Peru form a tiny {{minority}} in the country. The first immigrants from India to have arrived in Peru were businessmen who had gone there in the early 1960s. Later on, the community grew in number marginally until the early 1980s, after which many of its members left due to the <b>severe</b> local <b>economic</b> crises and the prevailing terrorism.|$|R
50|$|While Madagascar's {{conservation}} crisis remains <b>severe,</b> its <b>economic</b> {{situation is}} also grave. With {{a population that}} is more than 80 percent agrarian, limiting resource through the creation of parks and farming restrictions is economically devastating to a significant percentage of the rural population. The need for economic development is thus exacerbated by the rapid growth of environmental policies and institutions.|$|R
50|$|The Wythenshawe {{area has}} {{historically}} suffered from some <b>severe</b> social and <b>economic</b> problems (the former ward of Benchill was assessed {{as the most}} deprived {{in the country in}} the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2000).|$|R
5|$|The town lies on {{the ancient}} Watling Street, but is not {{recorded}} before the 17th century, although Ogley Hay, which in modern times is a district of the town, is recorded as a settlement in the Domesday Book. Brownhills quickly grew around the coal mining industry, especially after it became linked to the canal and railway networks in the mid-19th century, {{and by the end}} of the century had grown from a hamlet of only 300 inhabitants to a town with a population of over , of whom the vast majority were employed in the coal industry. Mining remained the town's principal industry until the 1950s, but the subsequent closure of the area's pits led to a <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> decline which has continued until the present day. The local authority has instituted a regeneration programme which it is hoped will revive the town's fortunes, providing better transport and leisure facilities.|$|E
5|$|His son Charles I {{attempted}} to impose {{elements of the}} English religious settlement on his other kingdoms. Relations gradually deteriorated resulting in the Bishops' Wars (1637–40), ending in defeat for Charles and helping {{to bring about the}} War of Three Kingdoms. The Scots entered the war in England on the Parliamentary side, helping to turn the tide against the king's forces. In the Second and Third Civil Wars (1648–51) they took the side of Charles I and after his execution that of his son Charles II, leading to defeat, occupation by a parliamentary army under Oliver Cromwell and incorporation into the Commonwealth. The Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 saw the return of episcopacy and an increasingly absolutist regime, resulting in religious and political upheaval and rebellions. With the accession of the openly Catholic James VII, there was increasing disquiet among Protestants. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89, William of Orange and Mary, the daughter of James, were accepted as monarchs. Presbyterianism was reintroduced and limitations placed on monarchy. After <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> dislocation in the 1690s there were moves that led to political union with England as the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. The deposed main hereditary line of the Stuarts became a focus for political discontent, known as Jacobitism, leading to a series of invasions and rebellions, but with the defeat of the last in 1745, Scotland entered a period of great political stability, economic and intellectual expansion.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{extractive}} {{industries have}} contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing {{at different times}} on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain, a trade which {{provided the basis for}} strong economic growth in New Zealand. High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> depression. Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank. In the mid-1980s New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three-year period. Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protected and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free trade economy.|$|E
50|$|Britain thought {{disarmament}} {{was the key}} to peace. France, {{with its}} profound fear of German militarism, strenuously opposed the idea. London thought it really sought military dominance of Europe. Before 1933, most Britons saw France, not Germany, as the chief threat to peace and harmony in Europe. France did not suffer as <b>severe</b> an <b>economic</b> recession, and was the strongest military power, but still it refused British overtures for disarmament.|$|R
50|$|The Great Depression was a <b>severe</b> {{worldwide}} <b>economic</b> {{depression that}} {{took place during the}} 1930s. The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations; in most countries it started in 1929 and lasted until 1941. It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century. In the 21st century, the Great Depression is commonly used {{as an example of how}} far the world's economy can decline.|$|R

5|$|Jardine {{threatened}} to withdraw his {{team from the}} Fourth and Fifth Tests unless the Australian Board retracted the accusation of unsporting behaviour. The MCC responded angrily to the accusations of unsporting conduct, played down the Australian claims {{about the danger of}} Bodyline and {{threatened to}} call off the tour. The series had become a major diplomatic incident by this stage, and many people saw Bodyline as damaging to an international relationship that needed to remain strong. The public in both England and Australia reacted with outrage towards the other nation. Alexander Hore-Ruthven, the Governor of South Australia, who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to J. H. Thomas, the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations. The standoff was settled only when Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons met members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour. However, correspondence continued for almost a year. Fingleton was dropped after scoring a pair in the third Test, and England won the final two matches to win the series 4–1.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, {{the socialist}} regime {{collapsed}} after 40 years, despite its omnipresent secret police, the Stasi. Main {{reasons for the}} collapse include <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> problems and growing emigration towards the West.|$|E
25|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union and <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> troubles in the Russian economy during the 90s, Russian immigrants and shoppers arrived in Kirkenes. Since the beginning of the European migrant crisis a lot of Syrian refugees began to arrive in Kirkenes via Russia.|$|E

5|$|After {{the deaths}} of Ivan IV and in 1598 of his son Feodor, the last tsars of the Rurik Dynasty, Russia entered a period of <b>severe</b> dynastic, <b>economic</b> and social crisis and instability. As Boris Godunov {{encountered}} resistance from both the peasant masses and the boyar opposition, in the Commonwealth the ideas of turning Russia into a subordinated ally, either through a union, or an imposition of a ruler dependent on the Polish–Lithuanian establishment, were rapidly coming into play.|$|R
