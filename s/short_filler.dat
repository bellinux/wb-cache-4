These comics were predominantly US reprints, ranging from war (Combat Kelly, Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos), westerns (Kid Colt, Two-Gun Kid) (published from the late 1950s) to superhero titles (published in the early 1960s), drawing the 'silver age' of Marvel superheroes, such as Iron Man, Thor and The Incredible Hulk.|$|E
40|$|Pressure Sensitive Ink is an {{electrically}} conductive composite material made by Peratech Ltd. The conductivity of the inks {{is sensitive to}} touch pressure, which {{have a range of}} applications in areas including telecommunications and robotics and are printable as functional electronic devices. The inks are complex and composed of {{electrically conductive}} acicular (needle-like) refractory filler particles dispersed in an insulating organic base ink. Inks mixed, prepared and stored in a variety of conditions have been studied using high resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopy, focused ion beam and EDX elemental analysis in conjunction with DC electrical characterization. The research has aimed to investigate possible links between the structure and electrical behaviour of the inks. The results have shown that inks stored for greater amounts of time, prior to printing, lose touch sensitivity. Causes for this are uncertain, but may be linked with the growth of nanoscale features on the filler particles and partial settling of constituents. EDX analysis revealed candidate elements for the nanoscale features found on filler particles. Modeling current-voltage plots with non-linear fits has shown there might be a switching of conduction mechanism with increasing compression of the inks. Additionally, the unclear process by which inks lose touch sensitivity was shown to be temperature dependent. Inks more vigorously blended were found to have <b>shorter</b> <b>filler</b> particles through a statistical survey of filler particle lengths, measured through scanning electron microscopy imaging. Inks produced with a lower filler particle to base ink ratio were found to be less sensitive to touch pressure than those made with comparatively more filler particles. A survey of filler particle clumps (groups of 3 or more particles) revealed that the addition of hyper-dispersant, an anti – clumping chemical agent, aided better dispersion of filler particles and increased the touch sensitivity of low filler particle fraction inks. ...|$|R
40|$|A wood residue – sawdust of the {{mechanical}} processing of aspen (Populus tremula) wood – was used to obtain a <b>short</b> fibre <b>filler</b> {{in the form of}} the modified microparticles < 250 μm for polymeric composite materials. To reduce energy input for wood size reduction and the activation of the lignocellulosic matrix for modification, low temperature acid hydrolysis of the residue under mild conditions was carried out. The effect of the pre-treatment parameters (acid concentration, hydrolysis duration, hydromodulus) on the fractional and chemical composition as well as on the zeta potential and contact angle of the obtained filler were studied.

5000|$|The next release {{would be}} an {{adaptation}} of Augusta Jane Evans's novel St. Elmo. The Thanhouser version of St. Elmo would bring the company some recognition and {{would prove to be}} a success, but the film is also presumed lost. Thanhouser would release two more original scenarios, She's Done it Again and Daddy's Double, before attempting two productions on the same reel. Released on April 15, 1910, A 29-Cent Robbery was included with The Old Shoe Came Back, a <b>short</b> comedy <b>filler</b> subject. The main subject, A 29-Cent Robbery, was the debut of Marie Eline, soon to be famously known as the [...] "Thanhouser Kid". Two more split reels would follow before the release of Jane Eyre.

50|$|It {{the early}} 1960s, after Fidel Castro nationalized the Cuban cigar industry, the Quintero brand was repositioned as a {{primarily}} machine-made cigar, {{and most of}} the handmade sizes were dropped in favor of machine-made or hand-finished cigars using <b>short</b> <b>filler</b> tobaccos, sometimes sold in aluminum tubes or tubos. For many years, Quintero was the only Cuban machine-made brand to be globally marketed by Habanos SA. As before, a large part of Quintero production went to Spain. Unusual among Cuban cigars, the Quintero cigar blend is noted for a herbal flavor with sweet aftertaste. The cigars generally benefit from several months of additional aging before smoking.|$|E

The current study expanded on this research by exploring how self-affirmation impacts healthy food choice in women. In addition, reading time and performance on a memory recall task were investigated as potential mechanisms explaining the effect of self-affirmation on food choice. Participants underwent a self-affirmation manipulation followed by exposure to an article describing the decline in social quality of life associated with obesity. After a <b>short</b> <b>filler</b> task, a memory recall task of the previously read article was performed followed by a dichotomous food choice task containing a healthy and unhealthy food option. Regression analysis revealed that participants with high Body Mass Index (BMI) spent a longer time reading the threatening article after self-affirming compared to those who did not self-affirm. In addition, this manipulation led participants with high BMIs to opt for the unhealthy food option. Limitations and potential future research are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-DNA {{normally}} {{integrates into}} random {{sites in the}} plant genome. We have investigated targeting of T-DNA by nonhomologous end joining process to a specific double-stranded break created in the plant genome by I-CeuI endonuclease. Sequencing of genomic DNA/T-DNA junctions in targeted events revealed that genomic DNA at the cleavage sites was usually intact or nearly so, whereas donor T-DNA ends were often resected, sometimes extensively, as is found in random T-DNA inserts. <b>Short</b> <b>filler</b> DNAs were also present in several junctions. When an I-CeuI site {{was placed in the}} donor T-DNA, it was often cleaved by I-CeuI endonuclease, leading to precisely truncated targeted T-DNA inserts. Their structure requires that T-DNA cutting occurred before or during integration, indicating that T-DNA is at least partially double stranded before integration is complete. This method of targeting full-length T-DNA with considerable fidelity to a chosen break point in the plant genome may have experimental and practical applications. Our findings suggest that insertion at break points by nonhomologous end joining is one normal mode of entry for T-DNA into the plant genome...|$|E
5000|$|The first title {{published}} by MLJ, Blue Ribbon Comics initially ran {{a mixture of}} content, {{in the manner of}} most early comic books.

[...] "Rang-A-Tang the Wonder Dog", the tales of an intelligent dog in the Rin Tin Tin vein, written by Joe Blair and primarily drawn by Ed Smalle, was the only feature to appear in every issue. Another, [...] "Corporal Collins, Infantryman", a war feature drawn by Charles Biro, about a U.S. soldier stranded in France when World War II breaks out was in every issue but the first. As all comic books did through the early 1960s, to satisfy U.S. Postal Service requirements for magazine rates, Blue Ribbon Comics also contained text stories, sometimes about characters from the comics features, such as the titular cowboy Buck Stacey.|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} short-fibre {{reinforced}} composites for dental applications. Particulate barium <b>filler,</b> <b>short</b> polyacrylonitryle fibres or short glass fibres {{were added to}} the dimethacrylate matrix to study their effect on the composite material properties. Methods used for this study were thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential compensation photocalorimetry (DPC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), three point bending, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The matrix curing was defined by heat of polymerisation, degree of conversion and polymerisation rate. Composite materials were characterized by the glass transition temperature, storage moduli at 35 °C and 100 °C, elastic modulus, strength, the critical value of stress intensity factor and the critical value of energy release rate.

5000|$|In <b>short,</b> a <b>filler</b> episode, {{that has}} the right idea, but lazy execution. Nate Boss, Project-Blu Following the episode's broadcast, {{as well as the}} home video release of thirteenth season of The Simpsons, “The Parent Rap" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews from critics. Writing for the Daily News, Eric Mink gave the episode a mixed review. [...] "To be sure, the show has its moments", wrote Mink, [...] "But there's not much zip here, and the show has, of all things, a warm-and-fuzzy ending... 'The Simpsons' and warm-and-fuzzy is not a healthy combination". Nate Boss of Project-Blu described the episode as “filler” and praised the episode's concept, but criticized how the episode was executed. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide also gave the episode a mixed response, and wrote that “'Rap' starts with a clever - if absurd - concept”, but “does little to churn good comedy out of its theme”, and concluded by calling the episode “disappointing”. Writing for Obsessed With Film, Adam Rayner described the episode as “woefully weak” and “an example of the farcical that the series would fall deeper and deeper into”. He did, however, praise the episode for being original. Jennifer Malkowski, reviewing the season for DVD Verdict, was more positive towards the episode. Giving the episode a rating of B+, Malkowski listed “The Parent Rap” among episodes in the season where “We see wacky scenarios force Homer to bond with his family, to a rather heartwarming effect”. Ron Martin of 411Mania was also favorable, calling the episode “decent”.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of different fractions of fiber fillers on the translucency and color change of short fiber composite with various thicknesses. Methods: Fiber composite resin was prepared by mixing resin matrix with various weight fractions of short (3 mm in length)   E-glass fiber fillers (0, 11. 7, 21. 0, 28. 5, 34. 7 wt%) and then silane treated particulate silica fillers were gradually added by using high speed mixing machine. Particulate filler composite resin without fibers was used as control. Composite resins disks of 10 mm in diameter and with various thicknesses (1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0, 4. 0, and 5. 0 mm) of each group were prepared (n= 3). Translucency parameter (TP) and color change (?E) were calculated over a white and black background using spectrophotometer to determine the CIELAB values of each specimen. Data were statistically analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: ANOVA revealed that fraction of fiber fillers {{had a significant effect}} (P Significance: Inclusion of <b>short</b> glass fiber <b>fillers</b> reduced the translucency values of the composite resins.

5000|$|During 30 {{years of}} publishing, Alan Class {{produced}} 26 b/w anthology reprint titles, some 1455 comics. Six of the titles - Astounding Stories, Creepy Worlds, Secrets of the Unknown, Sinister Tales, Suspense Stories and Uncanny Tales - lasted almost {{through the entire}} publishing history of the company. However, a number of Alan Class titles were un-numbered short-run or one-off issues. These were experimental titles testing the market for different genres of comics such as Romance (My Secret Confessions, which anthologised ACG love story reprints, and Uncensored Love), War titles (Journey Into Danger #1 - 8, reprinting Atlas war stories, and 2 issues of Tales Of Action), and Westerns (3 issues of Blazing Trails featuring Charlton and Fawcett Western stories, and one issue of Hell-Fire Raiders(1966) reprinting Fawcett Tom Mix, Tex Ritter and Lash LaRue stories). None of these {{went on to become}} longer-running titles - Alan Class would later say of the whole line [...] "Only the suspense/space stories stood the test of time." [...] Interestingly, although many of the reprints scattered across the successful anthologies were science-fiction stories, titles themed solely on science fiction were comparative failures. Class tried first with one issue of Race For the Moon (1959), anthologising Harvey science fiction reprints, followed by Outer Space(1961), featuring mainly Charlton reprints, which ran only 10 issues, and Race Into Space the same year, which again only lasted one issue. The same year Class published probably the only science fiction title that was a deliberate one-off - Space Adventures Presents Space Trip To The Moon (1961), which was a reprint of Fawcett's 1950 one shot Destination Moon, itself an adaptation of the 1950 film of the same name with <b>short</b> story <b>fillers.</b> It is possible that this was part of Class's licence for the Charlton inventory as that company had reprinted the tale in Space Adventures #20 (March 1956). Later in the 1960s, the science fiction title Out Of This World ran for two separate series, the first run of 23 issues - advertised as a [...] "new Mystery Space series" [...] - mainly reprinting Charlton stories (including the 'Tales of the Mysterious Traveler' by Steve Ditko), and a 10 issue run in the 1970s.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of short fibre and particle reinforced polymer composites for plain bearing liners for aerospace applications. Detailed experimental investigations of the tribological and mechanical characteristics of these materials has been completed. The thesis culminates with the identification of two possible materials that have the potential for direct injection moulding of a bearing liner. 1. Developing an Injection moulding process A thorough understanding of the capability of injection moulding PEEK composites was achieved through experimental investigation. Knowledge of the impact of varying injection moulding parameters on the final material was identified. 2. Friction and wear testing A bespoke test rig, in line with aerospace standards, was developed to allow the investigation of composite materials. Testing was conducted at room and high temperatures. A full analysis {{of the impact of the}} selected bulk material, <b>short</b> fibres and <b>fillers</b> was completed. Key parameters such as coefficient of friction, wear and fatigue life were identified. Further testing using optical microscopy was completed to enhance the understanding of the wear process and to support the findings of the detailed friction and wear testing program. 3. Mechanical testing The mechanical performance of PEEK materials was investigated through experimental analysis and available data. Again the impact of differing ratios of <b>fillers</b> and <b>short</b> fibres was determined. In addition static testing was used to investigate instantaneous strain and creep of selected materials. 4. Development of PEEK blends A final testing programme of two identified blends was completed that aimed to optimise for wear, friction and mechanical performance. The materials selected ware successful in matching aspects of the established design criteria but further work on the blends needs to be completed.

40|$|Kao »okvir« za pjesmarice predlažemo računalno modeliranje, smatrajući da se računalnim metodama može najlakše izaći na kraj s velikom količinom sličnih podataka, kakve obično sadrže rukopisni zbornici. To modeliranje ne traži drugo osim elementarne računalne pismenosti – u našem slučaju, poznavanja tzv. tabličnog kalkulatora. Računalni opis traži apsolutnu eksplicitnost i dosljednost, a rezultira modelom koji nije statičan – može se i širiti i mijenjati, ali i preslagivati i filtrirati. Gotovo nasumično preslagivanje i filtriranje iskušali smo na opisu zbornika Varia Dalmatica, u koji su Trogirani Petar i Ivan Lucići zmeđu 1570. i 1670. zapisivali latinske tekstove, ponajviše pjesme i antikvarnu građu. Računalna manipulacija tabličnim kalkulatorom, udružena s uobičajenim filološkim radom na identificiranju tekstova, vodi nas do boljeg poznavanja strukture zbornika i autorstva uključenih tekstova, ali i do razmišljanja o anonimnim tekstovima, o poetičkim i prijevodnim vezama ovog rukopisa i Vartla (Lucićeva hrvatskog zbornika), te o etosu stiha u pjesmama Varia Dalmatica. Manuscript miscellanies {{are quite}} {{heterogeneous}} collections. Therefore they present {{the challenge of}} {{how to cope with}} all the information contained. Here we meet this challenge with simple computing tools (spreadsheets), instead of the usual printed indexes, descriptions, lists and concordances. Having compiled {{a list of all the}} interesting questions about a manuscript miscellany – concerning both its physical features and its contents – it is easy to transform these questions into column headings, and to proceed to answer them for each and every text and page in the miscellany, filling out columns in a spreadsheet table. This almost mechanical task forces the description to remain consistent and explicit. Afterwards, with the contents of the miscellany represented as a digital table, we have a highly manipulable »model« of the MS: a representation which may be sorted, regrouped, and filtered at will, accepting also later corrections, or enlargements with further columns and rows. To illustrate such digital frame for a miscellany we prepared a spreadsheet description of a MS collection of Latin texts known as Varia Dalmatica (Zadar, Znanstvena knjižnica / Science Library, shelf no. 253290, MS 617); the MS was compiled c. 1570 - 1670 by Petar and Ivan Lucić from Trogir). The description, freely available at [URL] contains basic data (page number, title, incipit, author etc.) on all 337 texts from the MS. This spreadsheet was then explored in several directions. The Varia Dalmatica is known as a collection comprising poems »mostly by Croatian humanists«. Therefore we tried to find out how many authors in the MS are connected with Dalmatia (this group turns out to comprise 41 of the 58 known authors). But then we looked for authors with the most texts, and they turn out to be »foreigners«: there are 58 poems by Symposius, a late Roman poet, and 48 poems by Nicolas Bourbon the Elder, a French epigrammatist (1503 or 1505 – after 1550). They are followed – but not closely – by »the locals« Ludovik Paskalić (16 poems), Marko Marulić, (12), Sebastijan Mladinić and Ivan Pridojević (10 poems each). The manuscript began as a repository for two large anonymous collections (identified here as poems by Symposius and Nicolas Bourbon); later it became a collection of Latin poems by authors local and foreign, major and minor; a remarkably homogenous group is formed of 16 poems by Paskalić; the group comprises many of the longest texts in the MS. A noticeable change happens at f. 90, where funerary epigrams for Petar Lucić are written in a different, less skilled hand, which belongs obviously to his very young son Ivan (born in 1604, the future cel-ebrated Croatian historiographer was ten year old when his father died in 1614). Here ends the collection of contemporary Latin poetry; further quires of the MS comprise texts of antiquarian interest, such as the Vita of Marko Marulić by Frano Božićević, various inscriptions, charters, chronicle fragments, and historical notes. Filtering the entries in the spreadsheet for texts without titles we noticed a discrepancy: though such texts in the MS are usually anonymous, one was attributed to Pridojević. This attribution turned out to be false. The two-line epigram in praise of St Jerome is quoted in the De situ Illyriae et civitate Sibenici (Juraj Šižgorić, 1487) as written by a friend of Šižgorić, a humanist from Trieste, Raffaele Zovenzoni (1431 – c. 1480). Further inquiry into anonymous texts in the Varia Dalmatica suggests that there are actually several types of anonymity in the MS. The authors of 173 texts of the MS are simply not listed; two cases are explicitly marked as incerti auctoris. In a further 40 texts the author is implied (by the group to which the text belongs, or by the authorship of the preceding texts); ten texts hide their authors behind initials, and such texts seem to be mostly by local writers. When we selected a subgroup of anonymous didactic and memorable texts – today they would be part of Latin dicta et sententiae – examining their position and function on the page, we recognized a practice known from another MS compiled by Petar Lucić, the Croatian miscellany Vartal. In both MSs Lucić uses the <b>shorter</b> poems as <b>filler</b> for empty space on the pages. During this examination we identified three short Croatian poems by Lucić from Vartal (no. 83 in the edition by Kolumbić, 1990) as translations of Latin mnemonic verse included in the Varia Dalmatica (ff. 38 r, 63 r). Finally, we researched the metrical form of poems in the MS, finding a great preponderance of hexameter (197 poems, 1686 verses) and elegiac couplets (39 poems, 1684 verses). Sapphic strophe, hendecasyllable, and versus caudati are used rarely, alcaic strophe and iambic dimeter just once. This led us to explore the correlation of length, meter, and content in the MS: does the content influence meter in longer poems? Five of the longest poems from the MS (by Fran Trankvil Andreis, Paskalić, and Marulić) are political and religious; all are in hexameter. Even the exception, a description of an imagined locus amoenus by Paskalić (De nemore Corytio), contains strong religious overtones. Of the next five longest poems, four are in elegiacs (the hexameter piece, by Trankvil Andreis, is a political pamphlet). Elegiac poems are written by Marulić, Pridojević, Paskalić and Mladinić; three of the poems are either love poetry or epistles. One, however, is different. Pridojević chose elegiacs for a praise of Trogir (Ad nobiles viros Tragurienses patris Ioannis Pridoevii Scardoniensis de Tragurii praeclarae Dalmatiae urbis laudibus carmen), which is not an epistle, but something similar to a speech in verse. For such a task we would expect hexameter (chosen on similar occasions by Trankvil Andreis and Frano Mužić for poems included in the MS). The reason for the different ethos of elegiacs may be later date of the Pridojević poem; it is at least forty years younger than other texts of similar content and length in the MS. The digital model of the Varia Dalmatica proposed here presents only a very rough approximation of the actual artifact. But it was never intended to replace the artifact itself; rather, the model encouraged us to think differently of the artifact, to ask different questions, to experiment, in the process bringing forth new knowledge almost as a by-product...|$|R
