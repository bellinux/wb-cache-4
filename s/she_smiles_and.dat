500|$|Constance {{returns home}} from the hairdresser to find that her {{grandson}} Michael, the Antichrist, has killed his nanny. <b>She</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> remarks, [...] "Now what am I {{going to do with}} you?" [...] as Michael gleefully smiles back, while swinging back and forth in his rocking chair.|$|E
500|$|The TARDIS {{had been}} {{previously}} turned invisible by damage to its visual stabiliser in the Second Doctor story The Invasion. When Canton first leaves the TARDIS, the Doctor remarks, [...] "Brave heart, Canton," [...] {{a reference to the}} Fifth Doctor's recurrent statement to his companion Tegan Jovanka, [...] "Brave heart, Tegan." [...] When Amy asks the younger Doctor to trust her, he asks her to swear to him on something that matters. After some thought, <b>she</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> says [...] "Fish fingers and custard," [...] referring to events in [...] "The Eleventh Hour," [...] when Amy first meets the Doctor as a little girl.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Ferreira walking towards a blue {{projector}} screen, wearing black sunglasses, a black {{jacket and a}} transparent, fishnet-pattern top. Ferreira stops and removes the jacket slowly {{as a group of}} voyeurs observes her. During her act, she continuously looks towards a man with shades and long hair, who sips a drink while watching Ferreira. Outside the nightclub, she is seen again with that man—her apparent love interest—as they kiss each other and involve themselves physically. They reencounter in a black room where Ferreira sticks an ice pick on his face; in response, he slaps her, to which <b>she</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> they start kissing again. After they reenter the nightclub, another man kisses her, while her love interest looks surprised. The latter walks away and finds a woman with whom he starts dancing and kissing, much to Ferreira's sadness. The next morning, she wakes up in a grass field with red marks on her face while holding the ice pick, which is now covered in blood. In a different setting, the man, who is lying on a bed, sees his stomach cut with the word [...] "not", dripping blood as well. Spins Marc Hogan found the video too [...] "focused on Ferreira's model" [...] abilities to [...] "complement the song effectively".|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> only <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> never spoke, <b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> went away; But when she'd gone {{my heart}} was broke, And my wits was clean astray.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> {{regarded}} {{him with the}} mild pity of superior knowledge.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> {{took from}} her bosom the {{photograph}} of the cottage.|$|R
6000|$|... (She tries {{hard not}} to smile, but <b>she</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> he smiles, and they make comic faces at each other, as they have done in similar {{circumstances}} since she first opened her eyes.) ...|$|E
60|$|Lor. She is of {{a middle}} stature, dark-coloured hair, the most bewitching leer with her eyes, the most roguish cast! her cheeks are dimpled when <b>she</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> her smiles would tempt an hermit.|$|E
6000|$|PETKOFF. Oh, very well, very well. (They go {{into the}} house {{together}} affectionately. Sergius, left alone with Raina, looks anxiously at her, fearing that she may be still offended. <b>She</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> stretches out her arms to him.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> seated herself, leaning {{a little}} forward, looking upon the ground.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> then to Shefford {{she seemed}} to gleam, to be radiant.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> {{went over}} to the table to write on her slate.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{never knew}} a sweeter, {{healthier}} or more contented baby. <b>She</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> sleeps perpetually and seems thoroughly wholesome. Were she {{to remain in}} her present robust condition {{there would be little}} need of my services, I assure you. But—” ...|$|E
6000|$|Hours fly! it is Eve; {{the soft}} star lights {{him to his}} home; she meets him as his shadow falls on the threshold! <b>she</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> their child, {{stretching}} forth its tender hands from its mother's bosom, struggles to lisp [...] "Father!" ...|$|E
6000|$|There they were--the bailiff--two jondarms with him--Toinette, {{and an old}} waiter. When Toinette sees master, <b>she</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> says: [...] "Dis donc, Charles! ou est donc ton maitre? Chez lui, n'est-ce pas? C'est le jeune a monsieur," [...] says she, curtsying to the bailiff.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> {{kissed his}} cheek, and still held his hand. 'Adrian,' she said.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> {{took up a}} magazine. Wolfenden's servant came respectfully to the window.|$|R
60|$|The lady said, 'O, you droll monster!' as <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> {{watched him}} stride ahead.|$|R
6000|$|... [He goes out. The AMAH is {{standing}} near the table. While KNOX and HARRY go on talking she notices KNOX'S pin. <b>She</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> smiles and makes little bows to the two men, {{but at the same}} time her hand cautiously reaches out for the pin and closes on it. Then she secretes it in her sleeve.|$|E
6000|$|Nay, if she love me not, I {{care not}} for her: [...] Shall I look pale because the maiden blooms [...] Or sigh because <b>she</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> smiles on others [...] Not I, by Heaven!--I hold my peace too dear, [...] To let it, like the plume upon her cap, [...] Shake at each nod that her caprice shall dictate. [...] Old Play.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you could}} but see her now, Fred," [...] said Henrietta, [...] "I {{think you would}} indeed say so. She has {{now and then a}} {{beautiful}} little pink flush, that lights up her eyes as well as her cheeks; and when <b>she</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> talks about those old times with papa, she does really look just like the miniature, all but her thinness." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> {{shook her}} head, {{stretching}} {{out her hand}} to recover the Gnostic charm.|$|R
60|$|Ozma {{had been}} {{thoughtful}} during the story, but now <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> pressed her little friend's hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> {{nodded and}} {{suddenly}} Belinda, up above their lowered heads, accidentally and irrelevantly, no doubt, coughed.|$|R
6000|$|... [The door opens. There enters JANET BLAKE, {{followed}} by HAKE, who proceeds with his work. JANET BLAKE is a slight, fragile-looking creature, her great dark eyes--the {{eyes of a}} fanatic--emphasise the pallor of her childish face. She is shabbily dressed; a plain, uninteresting girl until <b>she</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> then her face becomes quite beautiful. PHOEBE darts to meet her.] Good girl. Was afraid--I say, you're wet through.|$|E
6000|$|But lo! to Sappho's melting airs [...] Descends {{the radiant}} queen of love; [...] <b>She</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> asks what fonder cares [...] Her suppliant's plaintive {{measures}} move. [...] Why is my faithful maid distrest? [...] Who, Sappho, wounds thy tender breast? [...] Say, flies he? soon he shall pursue: [...] Shuns he thy gifts? he soon shall give: [...] Slights he thy sorrows? he shall grieve, [...] And soon to all thy wishes bow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! famously--just as all girls do, you know. She blushes, and {{sometimes}} she looks vexed; then <b>she</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> puts up her lip, and says 'Nonsense!' and 'What folly!' 'Rupert, I'm surprised at you!' and {{all that sort of}} stuff, which deceives nobody, you'll understand, not even her poor, simple, silly brother. But, Miles, I must quit you now, for I have an engagement to accompany a party to the theatre, and {{was on my way to}} join them when we met. Cooper plays, and you know what a lion he is; one would not wish to lose a syllable of his Othello." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> {{took her}} {{foot off the}} chair--then, after a moment's thought, she pointed to it again.|$|R
60|$|El-Soo {{thought for}} a moment, and saw the error she had made. <b>She</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>she</b> laughed.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> {{pointed to}} the rising ground behind them. In the faint {{moonlight}} two forms were just visible.|$|R
6000|$|... "She comes {{each night}} now, taking the same seat beside the embers, and [...] fixing upon me those eyes, with the hell-light in them, that burn into [...] my brain; and at rare times <b>she</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> all my being passes out of [...] me, and is hers. I make {{no attempt to}} work. I sit {{listening}} for her [...] footsteps on the creaking bridge, for the rustling of her feet upon [...] the grass, for the tapping of her hand upon the door. No word is [...] uttered between us. Each day I say: 'When she comes to-night I will [...] speak to her. I will stretch out my hand and touch her.' Yet when [...] she enters, all thought and will goes out from me.|$|E
60|$|Then {{a little}} later than this meeting in the pavilion, though I am not clear now {{whether it was the}} same or some {{subsequent}} afternoon, we are walking in the sunken garden, and great clouds of purple clematis and some less lavish heliotrope-colored creeper, foam up against the ruddy stone balustrading. Just in front of us a fountain gushes out of a grotto of artificial stalagmite and bathes the pedestal of an absurd little statuette of the God of Love. We are talking almost easily. She looks sideways at my face, already with the quiet controlled watchfulness of a woman interested in a man, <b>she</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> she talks of flowers and sunshine, the Canadian winter--and with an abrupt transition, of old times we've had together in the shrubbery and the wilderness of bracken out beyond. She seems tremendously grown-up and womanly to me. I am talking my best, and glad, and in a manner scared at the thrill her newly discovered beauty gives me, and keeping up my dignity and coherence with an effort. My attention is constantly being distracted to note how prettily she moves, to wonder why it is I never noticed the sweet fall, the faint delightful whisper of a lisp in her voice before.|$|E
6000|$|... "She and her Ma's always quarrellin'," [...] said Mr. Lightfoot. [...] "Bonner is {{more than}} a match for the old lady, and treats Sir Francis like that--like this year spill, which I fling into the grate. But she daren't say a word to Miss Amory. No more dare none of us. When a visitor comes in, <b>she</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> languishes, you'd think that butter wouldn't melt in her mouth: and the minute he is gone, very likely, she flares up like a little demon, and says things fit to send you wild. If Mr. Arthur comes, it's 'Do let's sing that there {{delightful}} Song!' or, 'Come and write me them pooty verses in this halbum!' and very likely she's been a-rilin' her mother, or sticking pins into her maid, a minute before. She do stick pins into her and pinch her. Mary Hann showed me one of her arms quite black and blue; and I recklect Mrs. Bonner, who's as jealous of me as a old cat, boxed her ears for showing me. And then you should see Miss at luncheon, when there's nobody but the family! She makes b'leave she never heats, and my! you should only jest see her. She has Mary Hann to bring her up plum-cakes and creams into her bedroom; and the cook's the only man in the house she's civil to. Bonner says, how, the second season in London, Mr. Soppington was a-goin' to propose for her, and actially came one day, and sor her fling a book into the fire, and scold her mother so, that he went down softly by the back droring-room door, which he came in by; and next thing we heard of him was, he was married to Miss Rider. Oh, she's a devil, that little Blanche, and that's my candig apinium, Mr. Morgan." ...|$|E
60|$|Just then a {{young woman}} passed on the sidewalk; and I saw Mack kind of half snicker and blush, and then he raised up his hat <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> bowed, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> bowed, and went on by.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> {{gave some}} message to {{an elderly man}} in white shirtsleeves, who had {{followed}} her to the door.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and,</b> after a last, long glance, gave me {{back the}} {{photograph}} and the miniature, saying as she delivered the latter: ...|$|R
