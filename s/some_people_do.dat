5|$|Schizophrenia is a {{major cause}} of disability, with active {{psychosis}} ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness. Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate outcome in 35% and a poor outcome in 27%. Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world. These conclusions, however, have been questioned.|$|E
25|$|While formulaic {{language}} {{can serve as}} a useful cue that more is to come, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> develop an unconscious dependence on these filler words. When this is the case, it is necessary to correct the problem by making the speaker be aware of their over-reliance on formulaic language production and by training the person to make more efficient use of other verbal strategies. As the individual gains confidence and is less apt to have a need for filler words, the predilection toward formulaic language is then able to gradually diminish.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{language of}} the Inuit is a system of closely interrelated dialects that are not readily comprehensible {{from one end of}} the Inuit world to the other, and <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not think of it as a single language but rather as a group of languages. However, there are no clear criteria for breaking the Inuit language into specific member languages since it forms a dialect continuum. Each band of Inuit understands its neighbours, and most likely its neighbours' neighbours; but at some remove, comprehensibility drops to a very low level.|$|E

25|$|Health psychologists help {{to promote}} health and {{well-being}} by preventing illness. Some illnesses can be more effectively treated if caught early. Health psychologists have worked to understand why <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not seek early screenings or immunizations, and have used that knowledge to develop ways {{to encourage people to}} have early health checks for illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. Health psychologists are also finding ways to help people to avoid risky behaviors (e.g., engaging in unprotected sex) and encourage health-enhancing behaviors (e.g., regular tooth brushing or hand washing).|$|E
25|$|Some Jews {{believe that}} strict Jewish law {{requires}} that one should fast {{on the day of}} a parent's Yahrzeit; although most believe this is not required, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> observe the custom of fasting {{on the day of the}} Yahrtzeit, or at least refraining from meat and wine. Among many Orthodox Jews it has become customary to make a siyum by completing a tractate of Talmud or a volume of the Mishnah on the day prior to the Yahrtzeit, in the honor of the deceased. A halakha requiring a siyum ("celebratory meal"), upon the completion of such a study, overrides the requirement to fast.|$|E
25|$|The Devanāgarī script in Bollywood film titles is used {{mostly by}} Hindi {{speakers}} while the Perso-Arabic script is used primarily by Urdu speakers. The language used in Bollywood films is Hindi, {{but can be}} understood by Urdu speakers alike. Since {{a significant number of}} Indians cannot read the Devanāgarī script as India has a diverse linguistic landscape and <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not speak Hindi, English, which is written in the Latin alphabet, often becomes the way to communicate among Indians who speak different languages. For these reasons, the Roman script is used for most Bollywood film titles, alongside usual Hindi script and occasionally Urdu script, although instances of Urdu script used in Hindi films is becoming increasingly rare.|$|E

25|$|People rely on compulsions as {{an escape}} from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the {{intrusive}} thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on {{the context in which}} the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.|$|E
500|$|... "I saw Derketo's {{likeness}} in Phoenicia, {{a strange}} marvel. It is woman for half its length; {{but the other}} half, from thighs to feet, stretched out in a fish's tail. But the image in the Holy City is entirely a woman, and the grounds for their account are not very clear. They consider fish to be sacred, and they never eat them; and though they eat all other fowls they do not eat the dove, for they believe it is holy. And these things are done, they believe, because of Derketo and Semiramis, the first because Derketo has {{the shape of a}} fish, and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a dove. Well, I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way. For among the Egyptians <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not eat fish, and that is not done to honor Derketo." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lola" [...] {{was written}} as a {{critique}} of mainstream societal treatment of romantic love and heartbreak society. [...] "A wife’s just a whore with a diamond ring", Ndegéocello's sang. She drew inspiration from matchmaking reality television shows that presented love as a [...] "really clear exchange". [...] "I hear young women going 'well if he can buy me something'", Ndegéocello explained. [...] "That song—'Put It in the Bag'—which is based on 'can you buy me some things?' And then the male counterpart, all he can really talk about is sex and if the woman can cook. And it’s funny to me. That you're {{no more than a}} whore, you just have a wedding ring." [...] "Bright Shiny Morning" [...] was titled after the book of the same name by James Frey. Ndegéocello wrote the song after reflecting on her past lies and misrepresentations, particularly those she made in an attempt to be accepted in the music industry. [...] "People change themselves", she said. [...] "Almost in the sense of creating mental anguish in order to make other people happy and to obtain celebrity and fame. That's why the lyric is 'you do anything.' <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> anything for their big dreams of sunshine." ...|$|E

500|$|Although HCV was not {{discovered}} until April 1989, {{an estimated}} 170 million people worldwide are infected by hepatitis C. [...] As of April 2014, 130—150 million globally suffer from chronic hepatitis C infection; {{a significant number}} develop cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer. [...] Each year, 350,000 to 500,000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases. [...] No vaccine is available at this time. The symptoms of infection can be medically managed when the disease is diagnosed early, and a proportion of patients can be cleared of the virus by a course of anti-viral medicines. Globally, an estimated 50–95% of people treated are cured. With more recently developed medications cure rates are around 80 to 95%. The symptoms of HCV infection, especially in its early stages, can be mild enough to conceal {{the fact of the}} disease; thus, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not seek treatment. [...] As Live Aid founder Bob Geldof states, [...] "Stigma, shame and fear can suffocate awareness. These barriers prevent people from getting tested, receiving treatment, and clearing themselves of this disease". A number of celebrities diagnosed with the disease have decided to go public in order to raise awareness about hepatitis C and to encourage more people to get tested for the disease.|$|E

2500|$|A virtual economy (or {{sometimes}} synthetic economy) is an emergent economy {{existing in}} a virtual world, usually exchanging virtual goods {{in the context of}} an Internet game.

However, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> interact with virtual economies for [...] "real" [...] economic benefit.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{development}} from trainspotting (almost {{unique to the}} UK) is the [...] "haulage basher" [...] or locomotive haulage enthusiast These individuals attempt to ride behind or in the cab (<b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not count the latter as proper [...] "haulage") of as many locomotives as they can, marking them off in a book as would a regular trainspotter. Even the shortest haulage will count, such as being hauled for {{a few hundred yards}} by a shunting locomotive when one portion of a train is being hooked up to another at a junction. In some cases fans who like the sound of a particular type of locomotive working hard hauling a train will ride behind them as much as possible, even following English-built locomotives exported abroad, Portugal's 1800 Class (similar to BR Class 50) being one example. [...] "Haulage bashers" [...] sometimes use unusual words and language known as [...] "basherspeak".|$|E
2500|$|Rin, a {{girl whose}} arms were almost entirely {{deformed}} {{due to a}} birth defect, uses her feet to accomplish everyday tasks with surprising dexterity. She has short red hair and dark green eyes, and wears a boy's uniform to avoid the awkward situations that would arise from using her feet while wearing a skirt. Rin's unique personality has brought about awkward situations with her peers, especially for Hisao, and as a result, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not talk with her such as Lilly. [...] She is nonchalant with the other students and about their disabilities in general; she usually inquiries about other people's disabilities as a hobby. As a result, she is seen as extremely blunt, especially with the mention of her period. She is Emi's friend and hall mate, as their physical abilities complement each other. Her role in the school festival is being the sole painter of a giant mural posted {{in front of the}} dorms. Her name was designed as both a homage to legendary cartoonist Osamu Tezuka as well as a pun based of her talent as an artist and disability (the first kanji in her surname means [...] "hand").|$|E
