25|$|In {{its most}} {{traditional}} form, the morna obeys {{a cycle of}} fifths. The harmonic progression starts in a chord (the tonic) of a certain tonality, the <b>second</b> <b>chord</b> is the lower fifth (the subdominant), the third chord {{is the same as}} the first and the fourth chord is the upper fifth (the dominant seventh). These chords — tonic, dominant seventh, subdominant — have in Cape Verde the popular names of “primeira”, “segunda” and “terceira” (first, second and third) respectively of the tonality in question. For example, if the music is being performed in an A minor tonality, the A minor chord has the name “primeira de Lá menor” (A minor’s first), the E 7th chord has the name of “segunda de Lá menor” (A minor’s second) and the D minor chord has the name of “terceira de Lá menor” (A minor’s third).|$|E
500|$|After the solo, Francis sings [...] "If man is five" [...] several times. There is no backing, {{apart from}} the lead guitar, for several seconds, but then the song's chord {{progression}} is heard again. This is repeated for [...] "If the devil is six". At {{the end of the}} <b>second</b> <b>chord</b> progression, the song's main backing restarts again, with Francis screaming [...] "Then God is seven" [...] as the chorus approaches. The final repeated chorus of [...] "This monkey's gone to heaven" [...] ends the song as the string section becomes more prominent.|$|E
50|$|The chord {{buttons of}} the Accordion usually play master chords, {{allowing}} the bass buttons (or a <b>second</b> <b>chord</b> button) {{to supply the}} variable note (or notes) to complete the sonority.|$|E
50|$|Suspended {{fourth and}} <b>second</b> <b>chords</b> can be represented, in integer notation, as {0, 5, 7} and {0, 2, 7} respectively. The <b>second</b> {{inversion}} (quartal <b>chord)</b> is {0, 5, 10}.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} section, drums, bass, and guitar enter, {{and the music}} becomes more consonant, resolving to the key of A minor {{through the use of}} D and A {{suspended}} <b>second</b> <b>chords,</b> as David Gilmour sings a refrain of [...] "Ooh, babe".|$|R
50|$|Each {{suspended}} chord has two inversions. Suspended <b>second</b> <b>chords</b> are inversions of suspended fourth chords, {{and vice}} versa. For example, Gsus2 (G-A-D) {{is the first}} inversion of Dsus4 (D-G-A) which is the second inversion of Gsus2 (G-A-D). The sus2 and sus4 chords both have an inversion that creates a quartal chord (A-D-G) with two stacked perfect fourths.|$|R
5000|$|Similar {{motion is}} {{motion in the}} same direction, but with the {{interval}} between them changing. In other words, both lines move up, or both lines move down, but the interval between them is different in the first chord and the <b>second</b> <b>chord.</b> For example : ...|$|E
5000|$|Examples {{of use of}} the added-fourth chord, {{which almost}} always occurs on the fifth scale degree (notated [...] "add4") thus adding, [...] "the stable tonic pitch", include the <b>second</b> <b>chord</b> in the verse of [...] "Runaway Train" [...] and the {{introduction}} of The Who's [...] "Baba O'Riley".|$|E

5000|$|There is {{variation}} {{within the}} scene, for example from pop/rock like early Soft Machine and much Caravan to avant-garde composed pieces as with early National Health to improvised jazz as with later Soft Machine or In Cahoots. Didier Malherbe (of Gong) has defined {{the scene as}} having [...] "certain chord changes, in particular the use of minor <b>second</b> <b>chords,</b> certain harmonic combinations, and a great clarity in the aesthetics, {{and a way of}} improvising that is very different from what is done in jazz." ...|$|R

The distance between the receiver crystal and the first and second transducers are represented by respective first and <b>second</b> <b>chords</b> of the cross-section of the limb and the predetermined distance between the first and second transducers is represented by a third chord of the limb cross section...|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{initially}} composed in C, but was played in F on Rubber Soul (with a capo {{on the fifth}} fret). The verse opens with an F major chord ("Michelle" [...] - melody note C) then the <b>second</b> <b>chord</b> (on [...] "ma belle" [...] - melody note D) is a B79 (on the original demo in C, the <b>second</b> <b>chord</b> is a F79). McCartney called this <b>second</b> <b>chord</b> a [...] "great ham-fisted jazz chord" [...] that was taught to them by Jim Gretty who worked at Hessey's music shop in Whitechapel, central Liverpool and which George Harrison uses (as a G7#9) (see Dominant seventh sharp ninth chord) as the penultimate chord of his solo on [...] "Till There Was You". After the E6 (of [...] "these are words") there follows an ascent involving different inversions of the D dim chord. These progress from Adim on [...] "go" [...] - melody note F, bass note D; to Bdim (Cdim) on [...] "to" [...] - melody note A, bass note D; to Ddim on [...] "ge..." [...] - melody note B (C) bass note B; to Bdim on ...'ther..." [...] - melody note A bass note B, till the dominant (V) chord (C major) is reached on [...] "well" [...] - melody note G bass note C.|$|E
50|$|An {{anticipation}} (ANT) {{occurs when}} this note is approached by step and then remains the same. It {{is basically a}} note of the <b>second</b> <b>chord</b> played early. The dissonant (B, 7th degree of the C Major scale) in bar 1 is approached by step and resolves when that same pitch becomes a chord tone in bar 2..|$|E
50|$|The {{second is}} octave {{equivalent}} to the ninth. If one could cut out the note in between the fifth and the ninth and then drop the ninth down an octave to a second, one would have a <b>second</b> <b>chord</b> (C-E-G-BD′ minus B = C-D-E-G). The difference between sus2 and add9 is conventionally the absence or presence, respectively, of the third.|$|E

50|$|The song is {{composed}} similarly to many standard folk ballads, {{with the only}} exception being the <b>second</b> <b>chord.</b> It is a D major with a diminished fifth. In this context the D major flat fifth chord has a more dissonant character and lasts for a whole measure. It creates a very dreamy, surreal atmosphere. The song has four verses connected with a unison instrumental interplay of guitar and bass.|$|E
5000|$|Examples {{of use of}} the added-sixth chord (notated [...] "6") {{include the}} third measure of The Beatles' [...] "A Hard Day's Night", the <b>second</b> <b>chord</b> of [...] "You Keep Me Hangin' On", the third of [...] "The Eagle And The Hawk", and The Beatles' [...] "She Loves You", being used only {{occasionally}} in rock and popular music.

25|$|While the {{original}} tuning {{consisted of a}} G chord in root position, the standard tuning of the guitalin which was adopted is a C <b>chord</b> in <b>second</b> inversion. Another common tuning is a <b>second</b> inversion G <b>chord.</b>|$|R
50|$|Major seventh chords {{are usually}} {{constructed}} {{on the first}} or fourth degree of a scale, (in C or G major: C-E-G-B). Due to the major seventh interval between the root and seventh (C-B, an inverted minor <b>second),</b> this <b>chord</b> can sometimes sound dissonant, depending on the voicing used. For example, Bacharach and David's Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head opens with a major chord followed by a major seventh in the next measure.|$|R
5000|$|Although the two {{movements}} are shockingly different on the surface, their overall shape is remarkably similar. [...] Both movements fail {{to reach a}} definitive climax.

50|$|In country music, walkdown is a bassline which connects two root {{position}} chords whose {{roots are}} a third apart, often featuring an inverted chord to go between the root {{notes of the}} first two chords. See: slash chord. A walkup would be the converse. For example the chords G Major and E minor (a minor third apart) may be joined by an intervening chord to create stepwise motion in the bass: G-D/F-Em (I-V6/4-vi). The <b>second</b> <b>chord,</b> D Major, is performed with its third note, the F#, in the bass. Walkdowns may be performed by the upright bass player, the electric bass player, the guitarist, or a piano player.|$|E
5000|$|Carl Dahlhaus (1990) {{distinguishes between}} {{coordinate}} and subordinate harmony. Subordinate harmony is the hierarchical tonality or tonal harmony well known today. Coordinate harmony is the older Medieval and Renaissance tonalité ancienne, [...] "The term {{is meant to}} signify that sonorities are linked {{one after the other}} without giving rise to the impression of a goal-directed development. A first chord forms a 'progression' with a <b>second</b> <b>chord,</b> and a second with a third. But the former chord progression is independent of the later one and vice versa." [...] Coordinate harmony follows direct (adjacent) relationships rather than indirect as in subordinate. Interval cycles create symmetrical harmonies, which have been extensively used by the composers Alban Berg, George Perle, Arnold Schoenberg, Béla Bartók, and Edgard Varèse's Density 21.5.|$|E
50|$|The {{piece is}} based on series of studies which focus on {{different}} aspects of sound production: pizzicatos, harmonics, dynamics, contrasts, opposition of register. It is built from a single hexachord that contains the notes C - G - F - G - C - D, thus highlighting the intervals of fifth and major <b>second.</b> This <b>chord</b> constitutes the basis from which the whole string quartet is derived. The octatonic mode is also used extensively throughout the work.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} ways a guitalin is tuned. The most common tuning is a <b>second</b> {{inversion}} C <b>chord</b> with the courses of 2 adjacent strings tuned in unison with the lowest course (4th course) tuned an octave apart. This common tuning is GCEG.|$|R
25|$|A nearly bar-for-bar {{restatement}} of {{the opening}} promenade. Differences are slight: condensed <b>second</b> half, block <b>chords</b> voiced more fully. Structurally the movement acts as a reprise, giving listeners another hearing {{of the opening}} material before these are developed {{in the second half}} of the suite.|$|R
50|$|In this notation, which assumes G as the tonic or 1/1, a 7 lowers a pitch from a just {{intonation}} {{value by}} 35/36, or 48.77 cents; an upside-down 7 raises a pitch {{by the same}} amount. The first chord is a major triad and, relative to G, contains the notes 8/7 (231 cents above G), 10/7 (617 cents), and 12/7 (933 cents); the <b>second</b> <b>chord</b> is a minor triad comprising the pitches 7/6 (267 cents), 7/5 (583 cents), and 7/4 (969 cents). Notice that while the outer notes ascend from the first chord to the second, the middle note descends. Such subtle movements were among the attractions that Partch found in an expanded just intonation of more than 12 pitches per octave. Tonality flux is a special instance {{of the principle of}} parsimonious (most direct) voice leading.|$|E

5000|$|Sternklang {{creates a}} sense of [...] "non-progressive or {{circular}} time by blurring complex relationships between pitch and rhythm based on the overtone series so that the structure is perceived as inexhaustible and thus appears static" [...] The entire composition is based on five just-intoned harmonic sounds, each containing eight tones corresponding to the second through ninth partials of the overtone series. One of these tones in each chord is the E above middle C, tuned to 330 Hz. In the first chord this functions as the ninth partial, in the <b>second</b> <b>chord</b> as the eighth partial, and so on to the fifth chord, where it is the fifth partial. Compositionally, the harmonic structure fluctuates between an extreme situation in which all five groups share the same chord and the opposite extreme where each group's chord is different [...]|$|E
