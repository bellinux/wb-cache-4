40|$|The {{equations}} for {{the electromagnetic}} field in an anisotropic media {{are written in}} a form containing only the transverse field components relative to a half plane boundary. The operator corresponding to this formulation is the electromagnetic <b>system’s</b> <b>matrix.</b> A constructive proof {{of the existence of}} directional wave-field decomposition with respect to the normal of the boundary is presented. In the process of defining the wave-field decomposition (wave-splitting), the resolvent set of the time-Laplace representation of the <b>system’s</b> <b>matrix</b> is analyzed. This set is shown to contain a strip around the imaginary axis. We construct a splitting matrix as a Dunford-Taylor type integral over the resolvent of the unbounded operator defined by the electromagnetic <b>system’s</b> <b>matrix.</b> The splitting matrix commutes with the <b>system’s</b> <b>matrix</b> and the decomposition is obtained via a generalized eigenvalue-eigenvector procedure. The decomposition is expressed in terms of components of the splitting matrix. The constructive solution to the question on the existence of a decomposition also generates an impedance mapping solution to an algebraic Riccati operator equation. This solution is the electromagnetic generalization in an anisotropic media of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.
