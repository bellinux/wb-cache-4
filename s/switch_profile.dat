40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} non-linear optical loop mirror (NOLM) demultiplexer, operating with a soliton-shaped pulse for both control and data, is presented. The model can be used: to optimise system parameters (control pulse width, walk-off time etc.) for maximising peak transmittance of the switching profile; to calculate the <b>switching</b> <b>profile</b> width; and to estimate the <b>switching</b> <b>profile</b> through a new convolution approach. The simulation results are verified by numerically solving the non-linear Schrodinger equation. The NOLM model is then integrated into an optical receiver model for a bit error rate (BER) analysis. Simulation results show that BER, timing jitter noise and cross-talk are strongly dependent on the walk-off time between control and signal pulses in NOLM demultiplexing. The dependence of the BER on walk-off time agrees qualitatively with experimental results reported elsewhere...|$|R

This second-order system is shown to have a power self-trapping transition at a critical power greater than the third-order susceptibility coupler. Next, we consider a mixed coupler composed of a second-order guide coupled to a third-order guide and show that, although it does not display a rigorous self-trapping transition, for a particular choice of parameters it does show a fairly abrupt trapping of power at a lower power than in the third-order coupler. By coupling this mixed nonlinear pair to a third, purely linear guide, the power trapping can be brought to even lower levels and in this way a satisfactory <b>switching</b> <b>profile</b> can be achieved at less than one sixth the input power needed in the Jensen coupler. 2...|$|R

40|$|Eddy {{covariance}} {{has been}} used in urban areas to evaluate the net exchange of CO 2 between the surface and the atmosphere. Typically, only the vertical flux is measured at a height 2 – 3 times that of the local roughness elements; however, under conditions of relatively low instability, CO 2 may accumulate in the airspace below the measurement height. This can result in inaccurate emissions estimates if the accumulated CO 2 drains away or is flushed upwards during thermal expansion of the boundary layer. Some studies apply a single height storage correction; however, this requires the assumption that the response of the CO 2 concentration profile to forcing is constant with height. Here a full seasonal cycle (7 th June 2012 to 3 rd June 2013) of single height CO 2 storage data calculated from concentrations measured at 10 Hz by open path gas analyser are compared to a data set calculated from a concurrent <b>switched</b> vertical <b>profile</b> measured (2 Hz, closed path gas analyser) at 10 heights within and above a street canyon in central London. The assumption required for the former storage determination is shown to be invalid. For approximately regular street canyons at least one other measurement is required.

The majority of the spectral energy of the CO 2 storage time series was found to be between 0. 001 and 0. 2 Hz (500 and 5 s respectively); however, sampling frequencies of 2 Hz and below still result in significantly lower CO 2 storage values.

Two separate response surface empirical models are developed; one for the mean pull-in voltage and other for variation in the pull-in voltage due to microfabrication process tolerances. The developed response surface models are optimized simultaneously using the desirability function approach.

Navy has {{many opportunities to}} take advantage of energy sources that are usually wasted because these low power sources yield such low-voltages that a normal voltage converter is not efficient enough to harvest the energy. Low-voltage energy is available in many forms including solar, thermal, vibration, and electro-magnetic. The power that can be obtained from these sources on a small scale can be taken advantage of by using an ultra-low power boost converter that is specifically designed for energy harvesting applications. These energy sources with a very small footprint can be used in military and defense applications such as wireless sensor networks, industrial monitoring, and varieties of portable and wearable devices. The theory of power conversion, synchronous rectification, and maximum power point tracking is discussed.

40|$|In deep {{submicron}} and nanometer {{designs for}} battery driven portable applications, the minimization of total energy, average power, peak power, and peak power differential are equally important. In this paper, we propose {{a framework for}} simultaneous reduction of these energy and transient power components during behavioral synthesis. A new parameter called "Cycle Power Profile Function" (CPF) is defined which captures the transient power characteristics as a weighted sum of mean cycle power and mean cycle differential power. Minimizing this parameter using multiple voltages and dynamic clocking results in reduction of both energy and transient power. Based on the above, a datapath scheduling algorithm called "CPFScheduler " is developed which attempts to minimize the CPF. Experimental results show that for two voltage levels, three operating frequencies, switching activity of 0. 5 and power profiling factor of 0. 5, the scheduler achieves (i) total energy reductions {{in the range of}} 27 - 53 %, (ii) average power reductions in the range of 40 - 73 % (iii) peak power reductions in the range of 58 78 % and (iv) peak power differential reductions in the range of 60 97 %.

Power estimation has to be performed repeatedly to explore the design space throughout the design process at all levels. Dynamic Power Dissipation due to Switching Activity {{has been one of the}} major concerns in Power Estimation. While many Simulation and Statistical Simulation based methods exist to estimate Switching Activity, these methods are input pattern sensitive, hence would require a large input vector set to accurately estimate Power. Probabilistic estimation of switching activity under Zero-Delay conditions, seriously undermines the accuracy of the estimation process, since it fails to account for the spurious transitions due to difference in input signal arrival times.

This model accurately captures the spurious transitions, due to different signal input arrival times, by explicitly modeling the higher order temporal, spatio-temporal and spatial dependencies.
