50|$|There are {{different}} stocks {{available for the}} Uzi proper. There is a wooden stock with a metal buttplate that comes in three similar variations that {{was used by the}} IDF. The first version had a flat butt and <b>straight</b> <b>comb</b> and had hollows for a cleaning rod and gun oil bottle. The second had an angled butt and a <b>straight</b> <b>comb</b> and no hollows. The third had an angled butt and curved comb and no hollows; a polymer version is currently available from IMI. The wooden stocks originally had a quick-release base but the ones sold in the United States have a permanent base to be compliant with US gun laws.|$|E

50|$|The {{furniture}} {{features a}} <b>straight</b> <b>comb</b> butt, {{which has a}} rubber pad similar to that found on the Zastava M70 series of weapons, and a well-shaped contoured pistol grip. The fore-end is also reminiscent of that found on the M70 series. There is no butt trap for cleaning kit storage in the wooden butt. In newer production models the wooden furniture is replaced with synthetic polymer material which offers some storage space for accessories like a cleaning kit and reduces the M76 overall weight by approximately 0.5 kg.|$|E
5000|$|The Remington Model 513 Matchmaster is a bolt-action rifle, {{manufactured}} from 1940 to 1968. Since {{the rifle}} {{was designed for}} target shooting, it came equipped with a sturdy half stock with sling swivels, a beavertail fore end, and a <b>straight</b> <b>comb</b> which rose at the heel. Matchmaster barrels were a 27" [...] heavy target semi-floating type. The patented Matchmaster trigger mechanism had an adjustable stop. The Matchmaster was made to fire only the [...]22-caliber Long Rifle cartridge from a detachable magazine.

5000|$|According to rabbinical tradition, {{the hair}} counts {{as part of}} the body, and {{therefore}} water is required to touch all parts of it, thus meaning that braids cannot be worn during immersion; this has resulted in debate between the different ethnic groups within Judaism, about whether hair combing is necessary before immersion. The Ashkenazi community generally supports the view that hair must be <b>combed</b> <b>straight</b> so that there are no knots, but some take issue with this stance, {{particularly when it comes to}} dreadlocks.

60|$|The man who {{was engaged}} in being hanged was {{apparently}} about thirty-five years of age. He was a civilian, if one might judge from his habit, which {{was that of a}} planter. His features were good--a straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark hair was <b>combed</b> <b>straight</b> back, falling behind his ears to the collar of his well fitting frock coat. He wore a moustache and pointed beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose neck was in the hemp. Evidently this was no vulgar assassin. The liberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of persons, and gentlemen are not excluded.|$|R

60|$|Nothing {{could be}} more {{different}} than his whole appearance seemed {{to be from the}} confidant of a desperate man, and the associate of outlaws in their unlawful enterprises. He was a tall, thin, bony figure, with white hair <b>combed</b> <b>straight</b> down on each side of his face, and an iron-grey hue of complexion; where the lines, or rather, as Quin said of Macklin, the cordage, of his countenance were so sternly adapted to a devotional and even ascetic expression, that they left no room for any indication of reckless daring or sly dissimulation. In short, Trumbull appeared a perfect specimen of the rigid old Covenanter, who said only what he thought right, acted on no other principle but that of duty, and, if he committed errors, did so under the full impression that he was serving God rather than man.|$|R
60|$|We guessed her age to be forty-five at least, but {{we found}} out {{afterward}} that we were mistaken. She was only thirty-five. She was tall and thin and pale, one of those drab-tinted persons who {{look as if they}} had never felt a rosy emotion in their lives. She had any amount of silky, fawn-coloured hair, always <b>combed</b> <b>straight</b> back from her face, and pinned in a big, tight bun just above her neck--the last style in the world for any woman with Miss Ponsonby's nose to adopt. But then I doubt if Miss Ponsonby had any idea what her nose was really like. I don't believe she ever looked at herself critically in a mirror in her life. Her features were rather nice, and her expression tamely sweet; her eyes were big, timid, china-blue orbs that looked {{as if she had been}} badly scared when she was little and had never got over it; she never wore anything but black, and, to crown all, her first name was Alicia.|$|R

6000|$|Everybody went ashore to look around, and spy out the land, {{and have}} that luxury of luxuries to sea-voyagers--a land-dinner. And there we saw more natives: Wrinkled old women, with their flat mammals flung over their shoulders, or hanging down in front like the cold-weather drip from the molasses-faucet; plump and smily young girls, blithe and content, easy and graceful, a {{pleasure}} to look at; young matrons, tall, straight, comely, nobly built, sweeping by with chin up, and a gait incomparable for unconscious stateliness and dignity; majestic young men--athletes for build and muscle--clothed in a loose arrangement of dazzling white, with bronze breast and bronze legs naked, and the head a cannon-swab of solid hair <b>combed</b> <b>straight</b> out from the skull and dyed a rich brick-red.

But--and you will help me here, I'm sure, dear Seymour--I cannot allow them to arrest my CÃ©sarine. I don't pretend to say CÃ©sarine isn't guilty; the girl has behaved most ungratefully to me.

Still--I put it to you as a married man--can any woman afford to go into the witness-box, to be cross-examined and teased by her own maid, or by a brute of a barrister on her maid's information? I assure you, Seymour, the thing's not to be dreamt of. There are details of a lady's life--known only to her maid--which cannot be made public. Explain as much of this as you think well to Charles, and make him understand that if he insists upon arresting CÃ©sarine, I shall go into the box--and swear my head off to prevent any one of the gang from being convicted. I have told CÃ©sarine as much; I have promised to help her: I have explained that I am her friend, and that if she'll stand by me, I'll stand by her, and by this hateful young man of hers." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mary had a ruffled appearance, {{as if she}} {{had been}} running her fingers through her hair in the course of her conversation; she was dressed more or less like a Russian peasant girl. She sat down again in a chair which looked as if it had been her seat for some hours; the saucer which stood upon the arm {{contained}} the ashes of many cigarettes. Mr. Basnett, a very young man with a fresh complexion and a high forehead from which the hair was <b>combed</b> <b>straight</b> back, was one of that group of [...] "very able young men" [...] suspected by Mr. Clacton, justly as it turned out, of an influence upon Mary Datchet. He had come down from one of the Universities not long ago, and was now charged with the reformation of society. In connection with the rest of the group of very able young men he had drawn up a scheme for the education of labor, for the amalgamation of the middle class and the working class, and for a joint assault of the two bodies, combined in the Society for the Education of Democracy, upon Capital. The scheme had already reached the stage in which it was permissible to hire an office and engage a secretary, and he had been deputed to expound the scheme to Mary, and make her an offer of the Secretaryship, to which, as a matter of principle, a small salary was attached. Since seven o'clock that evening he had been reading out loud the document in which the faith of the new reformers was expounded, but the reading was so frequently interrupted by discussion, and it was so often necessary to inform Mary [...] "in strictest confidence" [...] of the private characters and evil designs of certain individuals and societies that they were still only half-way through the manuscript. Neither of them realized that the talk had already lasted three hours. In their absorption they had forgotten even to feed the fire, and yet both Mr. Basnett in his exposition, and Mary in her interrogation, carefully preserved a kind of formality calculated to check the desire of the human mind for irrelevant discussion. Her questions frequently began, [...] "Am I to understand--" [...] and his replies invariably represented the views of some one called [...] "we." ...|$|R
