5000|$|A {{starter solenoid}} (or starter relay) {{is the part}} of an {{automobile}} which switches a large electric current to the starter motor, in response to a small control current, and which in turn sets the engine in motion. Its function is thus identical to that of a transistor, but using an electromagnetic solenoid rather than semiconductor to perform the switching. In many vehicles the solenoid also engages the <b>starter</b> <b>pinion</b> with the ring gear of the engine.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} ways ejection pinions automotive starter {{and evaluation}} of {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each solution. The first chapter deals with the principle of operation of DC motors and starters parameters. In the second part, the individual systems are theoretically discussed in terms of design and their advantages and disadvantages. The third part is focused on the most common system, which is analyzed in terms of mechanical and electrical reliability. The last point of the work is to design an experimental analysis Reach <b>starter</b> <b>pinion...</b>|$|E
50|$|The solenoid also closes high-current {{contacts}} for {{the starter}} motor, which begins to turn. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened, a {{spring in the}} solenoid assembly pulls the pinion gear away from the ring gear, and the starter motor stops. The <b>starter's</b> <b>pinion</b> is clutched to its drive shaft through an overrunning sprag clutch which permits the pinion to transmit drive in only one direction. In this manner, drive is transmitted through the pinion to the flywheel ring gear, but if the pinion remains engaged (as for example because the operator fails to release the key {{as soon as the}} engine starts, or if there is a short and the solenoid remains engaged), the pinion will spin independently of its drive shaft. This prevents the engine driving the starter, for such backdrive would cause the starter to spin so fast as to fly apart.|$|R
50|$|The Bendix system {{places the}} <b>starter</b> drive <b>pinion</b> on a helical drive spring. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia {{of the drive}} pinion {{assembly}} causes it to wind the spring forcing {{the length of the}} spring to change and engage with the ring gear. When the engine starts, backdrive from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back and out of mesh with the ring gear.|$|R
50|$|A {{starter ring}} gear, {{sometimes}} called a starter ring or ring gear, is a {{medium carbon steel}} ring with teeth that is fitted {{on the periphery of}} a flexplate or flywheel of an internal combustion engine, mostly for automotive or aircraft applications. The teeth of the starter ring are driven by the smaller gear (the <b>pinion)</b> of the <b>starter</b> motor. The primary function of the starter ring is to transfer torque from the <b>starter</b> motor <b>pinion</b> to the flywheel or flexplate to rotate the engine to begin the cycle.|$|R
50|$|Before Chrysler's 1949 {{innovation}} of the key-operated combination ignition-starter switch, {{the starter}} was often {{operated by the}} driver pressing a button mounted on the floor or dashboard. Some vehicles had a pedal in the floor that manually engaged the <b>starter</b> drive <b>pinion</b> with the flywheel ring gear, then completed the electrical circuit to the starter motor once the pedal {{reached the end of}} its travel. Ferguson tractors from the 1940s, including the Ferguson TE20, had an extra position on the gear lever that engaged the starter switch, ensuring safety by preventing the tractors from being started in gear.|$|R
50|$|This overrunning-clutch pinion {{arrangement}} was phased into use {{beginning in the}} early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used. The Bendix system places the <b>starter</b> drive <b>pinion</b> on a helically cut drive shaft. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive pinion assembly causes it to ride forward on the helix and thus engage with the ring gear. When the engine starts, backdrive from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back down the helical shaft and thus out of mesh with the ring gear.|$|R
