5|$|Like its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee {{differs from}} {{traditional}} fighting games as {{the objective is}} to force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage, which will result in the character's death and the loss of a <b>stock,</b> <b>or</b> life. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{carriages}} operated as electric {{multiple unit}} trains without separate locomotives. Passengers boarded {{and left the}} trains through folding lattice gates {{at each end of}} cars; these gates were operated by gate-men who rode on an outside platform and announced station names as trains arrived. The design was subsequently used for the GNP and the CCE, and became known on the Underground as the 1906 <b>stock</b> <b>or</b> Gate stock. Trains for the line were stabled at the London Road depot south of Kennington Road station.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This study {{considers}} a general class of twodimensional, discrete population models where each per capita transition function (fitness) {{depends on a}} linear combination of the densities of the interacting populations. The fitness functions are either monotone decreasing functions (pioneer fitnesses) or one-humped functions (climax fitnesses). Conditions are derived which guarantee that an equilibrium loses stability through a period-doubling bifurcation {{with respect to the}} pioneer self-crowding parameter. A constant term which represents <b>stocking</b> <b>or</b> harvesting of the pioneer population is introduced into the system. Conditions are determined under which this <b>stocking</b> <b>or</b> harvesting will reverse the bifurcation and restabilize the equilibrium, and comparisons are made with the effects of density dependent <b>stocking</b> <b>or</b> harvesting. Examples illustrate the importance of the concavity of the pioneer fitness in determining whether <b>stocking</b> <b>or</b> harvesting has a stabilizing effect. 1. Introduction. System...|$|R

5|$|Up to {{four people}} {{can play in}} {{multiplayer}} mode, which has specific rules predetermined by the players. Stock and timed matches {{are two of the}} multiplayer modes of play. This gives each player a certain number of lives or a selected time limit, before beginning the match. Free for all or team battles are also a choice during matches using <b>stock</b> <b>or</b> time. A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one or a team has lost all of their lives. A multiplayer game may also end in a tie if two or more players have the same score when time expires, which causes the round to end in sudden death.|$|E

5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable <b>stock</b> <b>or</b> chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E
