40|$|Wildfires {{occur in}} the Republic of Mari El (Russian Federation) from time to time, that is why {{reforestation}} work {{is very important in}} the region. Some risks arise in the course of forest reproduction at fire-sites. Wastelands formation, May beetle outburst (Melolontha melolontha), fire recurrence are the most typical risks. Predominance in the forests (sandy soil) of the Republic of Mari El of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) determines regeneration of this very species. Accelerated growth of pine in fire-sites is achievable through artificial forest regeneration. The goal of our research is to study the influence of different technologies of plantation establishment in fire-sites on their development and productivity and assess possible risks mitigation in establishment and cultivation of the plantations. Eight different plots of planted Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) were studied. These plots are rectangular (Н- 1, K- 1, К- 3, К- 4, К- 5), square (К- 2) and <b>spot</b> <b>planting</b> (Н- 2, Н- 3) plots. The initial density of the planted trees was different in the plots; it was low (К- 1, К- 2, К- 3), mean (К- 4) and high (Н- 1, К- 5). It was revealed that in the plots where trees were planted with high initial density (more than 10000 trees per hectare) the risk of May beetle outburst was reduced due to quick canopy closure (up to 3 - 4 years). Two-row <b>spot</b> <b>planting</b> of Scots pine and leaving the wide inter-rows (Н- 2, Н- 3) makes it possible to carry out the prevention measures and contributes to forest environment preservation and natural regeneration of broadleaved species...|$|E

50|$|In late spring, {{dark spots}} {{appear on the}} upper surface of leaf cuticles in the low canopy. These spots are lesions {{produced}} by the infecting fungus, and later are the site of sporulation. Symptoms may also appear on the stem and fruit, but are most common on the leaf surface.

Stripper harvester though has been developed and tested in places like Britain, some Asian countries and Europe, its performance on rice harvesting was highly affected by setting of its critical operating parameters, therefore not practically accepted in some places. A 30 cm width self propelled prototype pedestrian controlled grain stripper header was developed, its optimum operational condition was determined for rice harvesting in a Nigeria farming system to replace the prevalent manual harvesting. The optimum setting of critical operating parameters of the stripper was at best when the machine settings was at 270 mm rotor height, stripper rotor speed was 17. 55 m/s and forward speed was 3 km/h.

5000|$|Christmas berry is {{an upright}} {{perennial}} shrub that grows 1.5 - 6 ft tall. It maintains a caespitose growth pattern {{and is often}} multi-trunked. Christmas berry prefers moist soil and germination can occur from pH 4 to pH 10. It does well in temperatures of 25°C and above. Germination rates are as high as 97.79% after 40 days. [...] Its leaves are simple, alternate and measure up to 8 inches long. They are waxy and dark green with a crenate margin containing small calluses within the ridges. The leaf tips are acuminate and their petioles are 3-10 mm long. They have a central vein with up to 18 pairs of side veins. Flowers are white or pink with yellow anthers and grow in axillary clusters and are very often covered in multiple black <b>spots.</b> <b>Plants</b> begin to bear fruit two years after sprouting. Christmas berry has an abundance of spherical, 1-seeded red berries of about 0.25 inches in diameter that remain on the plant throughout the year. The berry clusters often sag down below the glossy foliage. Berries are dispersed by birds and, when present, raccoons through consumption and subsequent excretion and also by water flow.|$|R

Plot I was an abandoned fallow, <b>spot</b> <b>planted</b> with Cassia semen, Plot II cultivated, mono cropped with maize and furrow line planted with Cassia semen. Plot III cultivated and planted with assorted crops, maintaining existing economic trees in a mixed cropping fashion with Cassia semen. Data analyzed during 5 years period reveals on Plot I; grasshoppers isolated Cassia semen and fed on rest of other plants, Plot II; damages were high during first two years and diminished as Cassia semen sprouted and developed, while Stock borers appeared to increase over time. Plot III, had no damages or significant disease effect, instead productivity increased. Cassia semen had toxic, repellant, and mortal effect on grasshoppers, prevented spread of disease and pest epidemics in plant communities, ameliorated micro environment increasing production...|$|R
