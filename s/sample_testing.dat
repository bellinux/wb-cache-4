40|$|In 2006 and 2007 {{beef and}} pork carcass swabs from provincially {{inspected}} abattoirs in Alberta, Canada were tested {{to determine the}} levels of total aerobic bacteria, coliform bacteria, and generic Escherichia coli, and the prevalence of Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). Swabs from beef and pork carcasses from 48 and 34 facilities, respectively, were analyzed. All <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> were positive for aerobic bacteria with 99. 8 % of beef and 96. 0 % of pork samples, having total counts of ≤ 100 000 CFU/cm 2. Coliform bacteria were isolated from 22. 4 % and 42. 0 % of beef and pork carcass samples, respectively. Generic E. coli were recovered from 14. 6 % of beef and 33. 7 % of pork carcass samples. For beef carcasses, positive tests were obtained for 0. 1 % of 1036 <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> for Salmonella spp., 1. 5 % of 1022 <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> for Campylobacter spp. and 5. 4 % of 1018 <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> for STEC.

40|$|Comparative {{evaluation}} of the semiautomated COBAS AMPLICOR hepatitis B virus (HBV) MONITOR Test (COBAS-HBV) and manual AMPLICOR HBV MONITOR Test (AMPLICOR-HBV) on 208 serum samples revealed {{no significant difference in}} the sensitivities of the two assays. Twenty <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> HBV DNA negative and 183 <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> HBV DNA positive by both assays. Three <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> positive by COBAS-HBV only and two <b>samples</b> <b>tested</b> positive by AMPLICOR-HBV only. HBV DNA concentrations determined by the two assays were significantly related (n = 183, r = 0. 97, P < 0. 0001), which indicates that COBAS-HBV could replace AMPLICOR-HBV. The major inconvenience of COBAS-HBV is the required performance of appropriate predilutions of high-titer samples in order to extend the narrow dynamic range of the assay...|$|R

2500|$|Manyonga {{opened his}} 2012 {{season with a}} jump of eight metres on the {{national}} Yellow Pages Series. However, the winnings of 80,000 Rand that he had received from his performances the previous year disrupted his life. Family and friends came to rely on him financially and he quickly fell into debt. Coach Mario Smith began to support Manyonga's family at his own expense so the jumper could focus on training. Around this time, Manyonga had become a regular user of tik – the local variant of crystal methamphetamine commonly used in his township. He first tried the recreational drug in 2011 and had used it when outside of competition (when it would not constitute a doping offence), but he gave a positive doping test in-competition at a national series meet on 20 March. He waived his {{right to have a}} [...] "B" [...] <b>sample</b> <b>testing</b> and admitted taking the drug for non-performance-enhancing reasons, resulting in his suspension from competition. He admitted he had developed an addiction in the preceding months and was admitted for drug rehabilitation.|$|E

50|$|As a {{protozoan}} parasite, {{the most}} effective way to identify Babesia infection is through blood <b>sample</b> <b>testing.</b> It is important to pay specific attention to particular morphologies of Babesia in blood smears because its substantial similarity to the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum results in many patients suffering from babesiosis being misdiagnosed. The few distinguishing factors for Babesia include protozoa with varying shapes and sizes, the potential to contain vacuoles, and the lack of pigment production. Trophozoites within an erythrocyte that appear in a tetrad formation are also indicative of Babesia. A trained eye is necessary to distinguish the two species.|$|E
