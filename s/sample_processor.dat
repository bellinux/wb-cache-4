40|$|Architectural {{simulation}} {{is extremely}} time-consuming given the {{huge number of}} instructions {{that need to be}} simulated for contemporary benchmarks. Sampled simulation that selects a number of samples from the complete benchmark execution yields substantial speedups. However, there is one major issue that needs to be dealt with in order to minimize non-sampling bias, namely the hardware state {{at the beginning of each}} sample. This is well known in the literature as the cold-start problem. The hardware structures that suffer the most from the cold–start problem are cache hierarchies. In this paper, we propose NSL–BLRL, which combines two previously proposed cache hierarchy warmup approaches, namely: no-state-loss (NSL) and boundary line reuse latency (BLRL). The idea of NSL–BLRL is to warmup the cache hierarchy using a hardware state checkpoint that stores a truncated NSL stream. The NSL stream is a least-recently used stream of (unique) memory references in the pre-sample. This NSL stream is then truncated to form the NSL–BLRL warmup checkpoint; this is done by inspecting the sample for determining how far in the pre-sample one needs to go back to accurately warmup the hardware state for the given sample. We show using SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks that NSL–BLRL is (i) nearly as accurate as BLRL and NSL for <b>sampled</b> <b>processor</b> simulation, (ii) yields simulation time speedups of several orders of magnitude compared to BLRL and (iii) is more space-efficient than NSL. As such, we conclude that NSL–BLRL is a highly efficient and accurate cache warmup strategy for <b>sampled</b> <b>processor</b> simulation...|$|R

Results from the glider and ESP observations demonstrated that blooms of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia sp. can develop offshore and subsurface prior to their manifestation in the surface layer and/or near the coast. A significant outbreak and surface manifestation of the blooms coincided with periods of upwelling, or other processes that caused shallowing of the pycnocline and subsurface chlorophyll maximum.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is a {{need for}} {{systematic}} evaluation of methods before their release to the market. We addressed this problem in novel homocysteine assays as part of an European Demonstration Project involving six centers in four countries. METHODS: Two immunological methods for measurement of plasma total homocysteine (P-tHcy), the fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) and the enzyme immunoassay (EIA), were compared with two comparison methods, HPLC and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). All laboratories performed the following procedures: (a) familiarization; (b) determination of linearity and precision by analyzing five plasma samples with interrelated concentrations for 20 days; (c) correlation using patients' samples; and (d) assessment of long-term performance. RESULTS: Both immunological methods were linear for P-tHcy between 5 and 45 micromol/L. The intralaboratory imprecision (CV) was < 5 % for FPIA and < 9 % for EIA used with a <b>sample</b> <b>processor.</b> The bias was - 2 % to 3 % for FPIA and 2 - 4 % for EIA used with a <b>sample</b> <b>processor.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The immunological methods provide results with little bias compared with HPLC and GC-MS.

40|$|Summary: A new commercially {{available}} Chemiluminescence immunoassay for the quantitative measurement of {{human chorionic gonadotropin}} and its-subunit in serum was compared with the enzyme immunoassay used in our routine laboratory. Human chorionic gonadotropin was determined in serum from pregnant women, {{as well as from}} women with abortus inaminens, suspected ectopic pregnancies or with molar pregnancies. The new human chorionic gonadotropin assay was also evaluated in combination with an automatic <b>sample</b> <b>processor</b> for distributing samples to the antibody-coated wells of the microtitre plates. The analytical precision, specificity and accuracy of the human chorionic gonadotropin assay were assessed with 152 sera, using the 60 min^incubation as well as the shorter 15 min version. Specificity was comparable with the conventional system, whereas the Chemiluminescence assay performed better with respect to the assay detection limit and measuring range. The enhanced Chemiluminescence system for the determination of human chorionic gonadotropin is an efficient assay which agrees well with our routine assay. In connection with an automatic <b>sample</b> <b>processor</b> it enables an advanced and versatile system for the determination of human chorionic gonadotropin in labo-ratories with large series.

40|$|A new {{generation}} of mobile sensing approaches offers significant advantages over traditional platforms in terms of test speed, control, low cost, ease-of-operation, and data management, and requires minimal equipment and user involvement. The marriage of novel sensing technologies with cellphones enables the development of powerful lab-on-smartphone platforms for many important applications including medical diagnosis, environmental monitoring, and food safety analysis. This paper reviews the recent advancements and developments {{in the field of}} smartphone-based food diagnostic technologies, with an emphasis on custom modules to enhance smartphone sensing capabilities.

We aim to provide a systematic classification according to the detection strategy, providing a critical discussion of strengths and weaknesses.

40|$|Among {{the sample}} {{preparation}} techniques, dialysis followed by clean-up and enrichment of the dialysate on a pre-column {{has proved to}} be a useful approach for the LC determination of drugs in plasma. By use of <b>sample</b> <b>processors,</b> like the ASTED system, such bioanalytical methods can be fully automated, the dialysis and trace enrichment steps being directly coupled to LC. In order to facilitate the development of such automated methods, a strategy based on a decision tree has been elaborated. After the selection of appropriate conditions for the LC analysis, the decision tree provides information about suggested starting conditions and guidelines for the optimisation of the most important parameters likely to influence analyte recovery and method selectivity. The plasma samples are dialysed on a cellulose acetate membrane in the static-pulsed mode and the dialysate is enriched on a trace enrichment pre-column packed with octadecyl silica or with a strong cation-exchange material. This decision tree is until now restricted to the analysis of basic drugs in plasma. In order to demonstrate the applicability of this method development strategy, an automated procedure based on the coupling of dialysis with trace enrichment has been developed for the LC determination of antifungal agents (clotrimazole, econazole and miconazole) in plasma.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{real-time}} VLBI system using Internet protocol (IP) {{technology has}} been developed to reduce network-cost and to expand connection sites of VLBI network. We call this system “IP-VLBI ” or “Internet VLBI”. We are developing the system consisting of a personal computer (PC) -based sampler equipped with a PCI-bus Versatile Scientific <b>Sampling</b> <b>Processor</b> (VSSP) board and FreeBSD (and/or Linux) software to carry out real-time data transmission, reception and correlation. The IP-VLBI system developed at CRL is dedicated to taking over current geodetic VLBI system. A geodetic VLBI system usually receives 14 to 16 frequency channels at S and X bands. A VSSP board on a PC can sample 4 channel data, hence 4 PCs can cover the current geodetic VLBI system. Each PC (4 -channel) data are transmitted to a PC for correlation processing independently through the Internet. Thus by only establishing the system for a PC sampler, we can easily expand it to the multi-PC sampler system, i. e., geodetic VLBI system. In parallel {{with the development of}} the real-time system, we are also developing a quasireal time (QRT) VLBI system. In the QRT system data are stored in a hard disk at first, then transmitted to a correlation site with a possible transmission speed of network. Of course off-line operation is also possible. In this case, data are transmitted after observations are made using an FTP or equivalent file transmission protocol...|$|R

Many technological bottlenecks are to be overcome. The idea is to design a discrete analog signal processor to challenge theses bottlenecks.

To reach that target, the SASP processed analogically the RF input signal spectrum thanks to an analog Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Once the spectrum processed, only the voltage samples representing the signal envelope to be treated are converted into digital. The selection of few voltage samples among thousands others replaces the classical mixing and filtering operations. It dramatically reduces the A/D conversion frequency from GHz to MHz frequencies.
