40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design, model, build, and test a flat panel speaker and frame for a spherical dome {{structure}} being made into a simulator. The simulator will be a test bed for evaluating an immersive environment for human interfaces. This project focused on the loud speakers and a sound diffuser for the dome. The {{rest of the team}} worked on an Ambisonics 3 D sound system, video projection system, and multi-direction treadmill to create the most realistic scene possible. The main programs utilized in this project, were Pro-E and COMSOL. Pro-E was used for creating detailed figures for the fabrication of a frame that held a flat panel loud speaker. The loud speaker was made from a thin sheet of Plexiglas and 4 acoustic exciters. COMSOL, a multiphysics finite analysis simulator, was used to model and evaluate all stages of the loud <b>speaker,</b> <b>frame,</b> and sound diffuser. Acoustical testing measurements were utilized to create polar plots from the working prototype which were then compared to the COMSOL simulations to select the optimal design for the dome. The final goal of the project was to install the flat panel loud speaker design in addition to a sound diffuser on to the wall of the dome. After running tests in COMSOL on various speaker configurations, including a warped Plexiglas version, the optimal speaker design included a flat piece of Plexiglas with a rounded frame to match the curvature of the dome. Eight of these loud speakers will be mounted into {{an inch and a half}} of high performance acoustic insulation, or Thinsulate, that will cover the inside of the dome. The following technical paper discusses these projects and explains the engineering processes used, knowledge gained, and the projected future goals of this projec...|$|E

30|$|In {{the last}} decade, Gaussian mixture model based on {{universal}} background model (GMM-UBM) framework has demonstrated strong performance in speaker verification. It is commonly believed that the mean vectors of GMMs represent the most characteristics of speakers [1], which are obtained by using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptation. Traditional MAP (or relevance MAP) treats each Gaussian component as a statistically independent distribution, which leaves many drawbacks in the real-world application: Only those components which are observed in the <b>speaker</b> <b>frames</b> are adapted; if training and testing sessions are too short or suffer from significant phonetic variability, the performance of verification may encounter an obvious degradation; on the other hand, traditional MAP does not have solution {{to the effects of}} channel distortion, especially when the enrollment and test sessions are from different channels.|$|R

Compared with the traditional MAP adaptation that only adapts those observed Gaussian components, CRA approach abandons those Gaussian components which give the least contribution in modeling <b>speaker</b> <b>frames,</b> length of each basis of total factor matrix is truncated while {{the dimensions of the}} total factor space remain unchanged, extracted i-vectors also remain unchanged. No modification is needed for subsequent channel compensation and scoring methods. Experiments were carried out on the core condition of NIST 2008 SREs. Experimental results show that by applying CRA algorithm in the phase of i-vector extraction, a 10 – 15 % relative improvement is obtained compared with the baseline system adopting traditional i-vector algorithm and related channel compensation techniques.|$|R

Typical video-phone call consists of close shots of <b>speakers,</b> <b>framing</b> their face in the foreground. For such particular application, a novel colour space (YST) is adopted to minimise the perceptual distortions on face coding introduced by watermarking. In the YST space, the luminance component (Y) is the same as in conventional YUV space, whereas the vectors S and T lie within the chrominance (UV) plane. The S (skin) component is a linear combination of U and V obtained as the ‘average’ chrominance estimated from an assorted set human faces to achieve a reasonable generalisation. The third component, T, is defined as orthogonal to the YS plane. The results show the benefits obtained in digital watermarking by the new representation against the conventional approach. In fact, the sensitivity of the YST representation outperforms the conventional one in terms of objective (mean square error, peak signal-to-noise ratio) and subjective (video-quality metrics) indicators...|$|R

40|$|This study {{outlines}} {{relationships between}} ideological construction and conversational performances, or utterances during casual conversation whose aesthetic quality is highlighted. I identify {{a distinction between}} native and nonnative English speakers that is imagined in predictable ways and expressed in regularized discourse patterns. The ideology of nativeness is rooted in a monolingualist {{view of the world}} [...] an association of one language with one nation [...] and intersects with ideologies of race and education. The regularity of patterns associated with this ideology provides resources for performances by white, middle-class U. S. university students about incomprehensible accents, bad teachers, lazy or angry foreigners, and rude code-switching or uses of non-English languages. Speakers use performative strategies such as rhythm, dialogue, and emphatic stress, to frame performances as worthy of special attention. Utterances are interpreted as more or less performative depending on the density and intensity of those strategies. The notion of the discourse frame accounts for speakers' desire to complete performances and for listeners' understanding that they are expected to respond positively. Performance and ideology are reciprocally related, such that performances index and depend on the stability of ideological models while providing opportunities for sudden shifts in ideological position as well as for transformations of those models. As <b>speakers</b> <b>frame</b> performances, they simultaneously create social truths, such as exaggerated hierarchical relationships between linguistic in-groups and out-groups, in ways that become memorable and at least momentarily acceptable. Because performances are bounded and memorable, they are decontextualizable, which enables them to be re-performed by the same speakers or by their listeners in other contexts. Performances thus contribute to the pervasiveness of the ideological discourse patterns that form the basis of those performances. Because of many speakers' drive to establish social solidarity with their listeners, performances can coincide with a dramatic shift in ideological position. Such shifts are also understandable if we recognize that dominant ideologies are embedded in highly regularized discursive patterns, readily available to any speaker who wishes to employ them...|$|R

Metaphor captures cultural stereotypes, encoded in a speaker's choice of descriptors, and is a powerful tool in the investigation of <b>speaker</b> attitudes. <b>Frames</b> are culturally accepted information sets surrounding every lexical term.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{patterns}} in the speeches of Thucydides' unnamed ambassadors which {{create a sense of}} the national identity of the speakers. While general scholarly opinion had tended to regard Thucydidean speakers as not able to be differentiated, some scholars have demonstrated characterising {{patterns in the}} speeches of named individuals, such as Nikias or Archidamos. I focus on three poleis, Athens, Corinth, and Sparta, and base my own investigations on those of the named speeches. I argue that patterns can be discerned in the anonymous speeches which differentiate these three poleis, and which suggest national characterisation. The first part of this thesis considers stylistic features of the anonymous speeches, {{in the form of a}} case study of the Spartan anonymous speech, as the statistical evidence highlights some unexpected features of this speech. Thus, I first consider sentence organisation, arguing that while the Spartans in their speech utilise an unusual amount of subordination, the speech retains the brevity and simplicity one would expect of Spartans, relative to speakers of the other poleis. I then consider two features of vocabulary which we would not expect to see in the Spartan speech, arguing that these features suggest an attempt by the Spartans to ingratiate their speech to the Athenians, and that the vocabulary underscores the unusualness of the speech and, due to two programmatic statements in the speech, ultimately serves to re-emphasise Spartan national character. The second part of this thesis considers broader rhetorical features. First, I consider how the <b>speakers</b> <b>frame</b> the persuasive purpose of their speeches, arguing that the Athenians frame their speeches as the giving of advice, as opposed to the Spartans' openness of purpose, while the Corinthians stand between the two. Then I consider the approaches to argumentation, arguing that the Spartans couch their arguments in a conservative, Doric framework, that the Corinthians are also conservative, and that the Athenians highlight the openness to risk-taking of the polis, and consideration of what is profitable, or advantageous. I conclude that differences in organisation of the speeches, length and relative complexity, and rhetorical posturing would suggest national character to a sensitive reader. That is, the Spartan speeches suggest a conservative, Doric polis, the Athenian speeches reflect a democratic state in which sophistic education is freely available, and open to risk-taking, and the Corinthian speeches reflect their geographical and cultural middle point between the poles of Athens and Sparta...|$|R
40|$|Seeking a more tenable {{conception}} of discourse, new cognitive theory considers conventional imagery {{as a sort}} of “middle ground ” through which the multiple meanings that emerge in distinct discourse situations are negotiated (Palmer, 1996 : 39). Conventional grammar should be recognized as a resource for observing the appearance and developments of such imagery. In Langacker’s usage-based approach toward grammar, grammatical rules are viewed as “schematizations of expressions ” (Langacker, 1991 : 555). They are the conventional tools of the language that allow <b>speakers</b> to <b>frame</b> the meanings that emerge within varied contexts. This discursive {{conception of}} grammar warrants consideration and development in anthropological studies because of its potential to offer a structuring framework of analysis for the constitution of discourse.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a general approach to contextual reasoning in natural language processing. Drawing {{on the view}} of natural language interpretation as abduction (Hobbs et al., 1993), we propose that interpretation provides an explanation of how an utterance creates a new discourse context in which its interpreted content is both true and prominent. Our framework uses dynamic theories of semantics and pragmatics, formal theories of context, and models of attentional state. We describe and illustrate a Prolog implementation. 1 Problem Statement Context in discourse and dialogue involves at least two components, shared information and coordinated attention; each of these components suggests a mechanism through which <b>speakers</b> may <b>frame</b> natural language utterances to fit the context. Shared information makes available to the par-ticipants a body of facts that characterize the world under discussion (here we mean to be neutral between various characterizations of this availability in terms of common ground, common knowledge, mutual belief, etc.); accordingly, language users may presume that information in an utterance links up with this body of facts, whenever possible (Lascarides et al., 1992; Hobbs et al., 1993). Coordinated attention puts certain entities {{at the forefront of}} the discussion; accordingly, language users may presume that descriptions in an utterance refer to these entities, whenever possible (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1997).

S. elite media coverage of China's one-child policy from its inception in 1979 until 2009. Framing analysis has been used to examine media attention given to domestic issues and international events, but little research has been done on U. S. new frames of another country's domestic policy. A mix-method approach of content analysis and qualitative framing analysis was used to analyze 83 articles from The New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Christian Science Monitor. Each article was broken into individual speech units called utterances, and a total of 1, 070 utterances were analyzed. In addition, this paper looked at the speakers who were providing the content in these articles and each <b>speaker</b> groups' <b>frame</b> preference. It was found that in the two time periods before China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, the dominant news frame focused on enforcement methodology. After 2001, the dominant frame dealt with coercive methods. Speakers from the Chinese government were found to have the dominant voice in coverage; over time, however, Chinese civilians increasingly challenged the hegemony of the Chinese government's voice. All U. S. speakers had a preference for framing the policy in terms of either political implications or the issue of coercion.

In Experiment 1, participants read a passage where a character describes a glass as currently half full or half empty before making a statement about the previous volume. We hypothesised that participants would infer that the glass was previously empty or full, respectively. Results suggest processing a previous volume of full is simpler regardless of the frame provided. In Experiment 2, materials were constructed to ensure inferences were based on participants' beliefs as opposed to characters'. Results support the information leakage framework; previous volumes of full and empty were processed more easily after current volumes of half empty and half full, respectively. We suggest that processing discrepancies between the two experiments are driven by word-related factors (e. g., markedness) or by participants' integration of characters' expectations...|$|R
