In 2010, complementary resistive switching (CRS) was introduced as a possible solution to sneak-path current interference.

For example, if the green-wire ground return circuit (in a three-wire power circuit) is fhulty or is open (someone cut the prong, etc.) a person can receive an electrical shock by touching the conductive enclosure, and the result can be lethal. If high explosives are involved m the process, <b>sneak</b> electrical energy <b>paths</b> may cause electrical threats that lead to ignition, which results to higher damage consequences. Proper electrical grounding is essential to mitigate the electrical hazard and improve work place safety.

In order to avoid any problem induced by crossbar devices, such as current <b>sneak</b> <b>paths,</b> all tested devices have stand-alone architecture.

In addition, voltage pulsing mode was used to program the devices in different resistive and capacitive states. Several voltage pulses were applied to the device using the two-pulsed measure units (PMUs) of the same characterization system. Voltage pulses of ± 6  V of magnitude and duration of 1  ms were used for programming the devices with a small voltage pulse with 0.5  V amplitude and 1  ms pulse width for reading the resistive states.

40|$|Size {{reduction}} of transistors {{has been the}} main reason for a successful development of computer systems over the last decades. Since the downscaling of transistors is assumed {{to come to an end}} within the next years, alternative technologies involving significantly less area consumption and an ongoing scaling potential are required. The smallest feasible area consumption (4 F^ 2) can be achieved by application of passive crossbar arrays. In combination with integrated resistive switches (also referred to as memristors) at each junction, highest possible density memory and logic applications would result. Resistive switches are two-terminal devices and offer a non-volatile switching behavior when applying short voltage pulses. Although individual devices have a low power requirement, passive crossbar arrays show significant power losses due to parasitic current <b>sneak</b> <b>paths.</b> This so-called ’sneak-path problem’ does not only lead to increased power consumption, but also complicates or even prevents proper array read operations. To solve this problem, the implementation of a rectifying diode-like selection device was suggested so far. However, this approach is difficult to realize for bipolar resistive switches, since high current densities (among other factors) are required. A completely new approach was developed within the framework of this dissertation. Here, two anti-serially connected bipolar resistive switches are applied to form a complementary resistive switch (CRS). Independent of the actual storing state, CRS cells are always high-resistive. Therefore, no parasitic <b>sneak</b> <b>paths</b> can occur. Proof-of-concept measurements were performed, showing CRS behavior for resistive switches based on both the electrochemical metalization effect and the valence change mechanism. For studying the interaction of anti-serially connected resistive switches, compact device models of resistive switches were developed. It could be shown that simple dynamic memristor-models are not suitable for simulating correct CRS behavior, whereas more complex, physics-based memristive models lead to realistic simulation results. CRS-based passive crossbar arrays are especially well suited for memory applications. It could be shown that large N•N-arrays (for example, N = 10 ^ 3), which are required for efficient implementations, are feasible with this concept. Two advantageous destructive read-out schemes could be identified: The first one is a level read scheme which is based on a conditional switching to the ON-state, whereas the second one is a spike read scheme applying a write pulse for each read operation. Additionally, an alternative non-destructive read-out could be implemented, but in that case, the possible array size is reduced. Aside from memory functionality, CRS cells can also be used to realize reconfigurable logic operations. In this case, complementary resistive switches can be considered as elementary state machines. Based on the logic implication function, which can be regarded as the basic function, several logic operations can be performed sequentially. It was evidenced that 14 of 16 Boolean functions can be realized by a single CRS cell, whereas two CRS cells are required to allocate all 16 functions; they are provided, for example, in a folded crossbar array...|$|R

In the micro-VDD-hopping scheme, VDD of each block is {{varied between the}} higher VDD (VDDH) and the lower VDD (VDDL) spatially and temporally to achieve lower power, while keeping performance undegraded. A level shifter that has less contention is proposed. The FPGA also incorporates Zigzag power-gating scheme, special care has been taken to cope with <b>sneak</b> leakage <b>path</b> problem. The proposed FPGA is fabricated using 0. 35 µm CMOS technology together with the conventional fixed-VDD FPGA. Measurement shows that the dynamic power can be reduced by 86 % when the required speed is half of the highest speed. Simulation using 90 nm CMOS technology shows that a leakage power reduction of 95 % can be achieved, when the proposed method is used. Area overhead of the proposed FPGA is 2 %. I...|$|R
40|$|Field-programmable {{gate array}} (FPGA) is a post {{fabrication}} reconfigurable device to accelerate domain specific computing systems. It offers offer high operation speed and low power consumption. However, the design flexibility {{and performance of}} FPGAs are severely constrained by the costly on-chip memories, e. g. {{static random access memory}} (SRAM) and FLASH memory. The objective of my dissertation is to explore the opportunity and enable the use of the emerging resistance random access memory (ReRAM) in FPGA design. The emerging ReRAM technology features high storage density, low access power consumption, and CMOS compatibility, making it a promising candidate for FPGA implementation. In particular, ReRAM has advantages of the fast access and nonvolatility, enabling the on-chip storage and access of configuration data. In this dissertation, I first propose a novel three-dimensional stacking scheme, namely, high-density interleaved memory (HIM). The structure improves the density of ReRAM meanwhile effectively reducing the signal interference induced by <b>sneak</b> <b>paths</b> in crossbar arrays. To further enhance the access speed and design reliability, a fast sensing circuit is also presented which includes a new sense amplifier scheme and reference cell configuration. The proposed ReRAM FPGA leverages a similar architecture as conventional SRAM based FPGAs but utilizes ReRAM technology in all component designs. First, HIM is used to implement look-up table (LUT) and block random access memories (BRAMs) for func- tionality process. Second, a 2 R 1 T, two ReRAM cells and one transistor, nonvolatile switch design is applied to construct connection blocks (CBs) and switch blocks (SBs) for signal transition. Furthermore, unified BRAM (uBRAM) based on the current BRAM architecture iv is introduced, offering both configuration and temporary data storage. The uBRAMs provides extremely high density effectively and enlarges the FPGA capacity, potentially saving multiple contexts of configuration. The fast configuration scheme from uBRAM to logic and routing components also makes fast run-time partial reconfiguration (PR) much easier, improving the flexibility and performance of the entire FPGA system. Finally, modern place and route tools are designed for homogeneous fabric of FPGA. The PR feature, however, requires the support of heterogeneous logic modules in order to differentiate PR modules from static ones and therefore maintain the signal integration. The existing approaches still reply on designers’ manual effort, which significantly prolongs design time and lowers design efficiency. In this dissertation, I integrate PR support into VPR – an academic place and route tool by introducing a B*-tree modular placer (BMP) and PR-aware router. As such, users are able to explore new architectures or map PR applications to a variety of FPGAs. More importantly, this enhanced feature can also support fast design automation, e. g. mapping IP core, loading pre-synthesizing logic modules, etc...|$|R
