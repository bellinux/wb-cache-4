40|$|Abstract. Characteristics of silica optical {{material}} largely depend on its thermal history. In this paper, formation of thermally induced defects in silica {{optical material}} is studied. The formation process of defect is analyzed in detail. The {{results show that}} there is an obvious difference in defect formation induced by heating treatment when the composition of silica optical material changes. Defect formation mainly displays as the produce process when the initial defects of the <b>silica</b> <b>material</b> are zero. However, defect formation expresses as the produce and annealing process when the initial defects of the <b>silica</b> <b>material</b> are not zero. The initial defect concentration can be decreased significantly when the <b>silica</b> <b>material</b> is heated in high temperature. At the same time, the new defect is also produced. These theoretic results are consistent with the previous experimental ones...|$|E

MOKOENA@sasol. comThe {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to prepare novel <b>silica</b> <b>materials</b> and then use them as supports/binders for the Fisher-Tropsch (F-T) reaction. Hence the thesis is divided into two parts - (i) the synthesis of <b>silica</b> <b>materials</b> (ii) use of <b>silica</b> <b>materials</b> as supports. PART I The studies that were carried out in this thesis evaluated the effect of templates and synthesis conditions on the nano- and microstructure and properties of <b>silica</b> <b>materials</b> that are obtained by the sol-gel method. The studies with DL-tartaric acid and citric acid as templates revealed that synthesis conditions (temperature, NH 4 OH concentration, water/ethanol concentration, time before NH 4 OH addition, static versus stirred conditions, stirring rate and solvent) all have an effect on the microstructure of the silica and influence the formation of particular silica morphologies. DL-tartaric acid produced longer and more uniform tubes when compared to citric acid. Tubes that are formed by DL-tartaric acid are hollow and open ended; however the ones formed in citric acid are a mixture of filled and hollow but closed tubes. Hollow spheres are exclusively formed when citric acid is used under certain conditions while only filled spheres are formed when DL-tartaric iii acid is used. The surface areas of the silicas formed from DL-tartaric acid are lower that the surface areas obtained for materials produced by citric acid. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of <b>silica</b> <b>materials</b> obtained from both templates showed that the materials were mesoporous with some microporosity present in them. Studies with mucic and tartronic acids as templates also showed that the template as well as the synthesis conditions (such as solvent, temperature and stirring) affect the resulting silica morphology. Mucic acid produced <b>silica</b> <b>materials</b> with high surface areas, mesopores and a morphology that reveals fragmented tubes. Tartronic acid produced hollow tube materials with low surface areas and a combination of micro- and mesopores. The yield of the tubes was higher at lower temperatures for both templates. When sugars (e. g. glucose) were used only spherical particles were obtained and some sugars gave particle sizes that are smaller than the ones that are normally obtained by the sol-gel method.

Thermo-gravimetric analysis of SBA-AgSD revealed a high loading amount of 52. 87 %. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis confirmed the drug entrapment into host material by revealing a reduced surface area (214 m 2 /g) and pore diameter (6. 7 nm) of the SBA-AgSD. The controlled release of silver sulfadiazine drug from the mesoporous silica to simulated gastric, intestinal and body fluids was evaluated. The Korsmeyer–Peppas model fits the drug release data with the non-Fickian diffusion model and zero order kinetics of SBA-AgSD.
