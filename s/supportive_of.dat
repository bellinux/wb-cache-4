5|$|Despite the {{extensive}} volcanism that gives Io its distinctive appearance, nearly all its mountains are tectonic structures, {{and are not}} produced by volcanoes. Instead, most Ionian mountains form {{as the result of}} compressive stresses on the base of the lithosphere, which uplift and often tilt chunks of Io's crust through thrust faulting. The compressive stresses leading to mountain formation are the result of subsidence from the continuous burial of volcanic materials. The global distribution of mountains appears to be opposite that of volcanic structures; mountains dominate areas with fewer volcanoes and vice versa. This suggests large-scale regions in Io's lithosphere where compression (<b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> mountain formation) and extension (<b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> patera formation) dominate. Locally, however, mountains and paterae often abut one another, suggesting that magma often exploits faults formed during mountain formation to reach the surface.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Investigation <b>of</b> <b>supportive</b> {{care needs}} <b>of</b> cancer {{patients}} {{is important to}} implement any supportive care programs. There is no relevant studies investigated <b>supportive</b> care needs <b>of</b> Iranian cancer patients and factors affecting such needs. So, the aims of present study were to determine the unmet <b>supportive</b> care needs <b>of</b> Iranian cancer patients and its predictive factors. Methods: In this descriptive- correlational study 274 cancer patients in one referral medical center in North West of Iran participated. For data collection, demographic and cancer related information checklist and Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS) was used. Logistic regression was used for data analysis of un-adjusted and adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) for patients needs and analysis of variables of study based on Backward LR procedure SPSS Ver. 13. Results: More than fifty percent of participants reported unmet needs in 18 items of SCNS. Most frequent unmet needs were related to health system and information domains and most meet needs were related to sexuality and psychological domains. The result of logistic regression identified predictors of each domain <b>of</b> <b>supportive</b> care needs. The variable such as sex, age and living situation were most important predictors of unmet needs. Conclusion: The results showed that Iranian cancer patients have many supportive care needs in different domains. In general female cancer patients are at risk <b>of</b> more unmet <b>supportive</b> care needs. So, health care professionals should {{be more sensitive to}} fulfillment <b>of</b> <b>supportive</b> care needs <b>of</b> female...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: In an {{equitable}} healthcare system, healthcare utilization should be predominantly explained by patient-perceived need and clinical need factors. This study aims to analyze whether predisposing, enabling, and need factors {{are associated with}} the utilization <b>of</b> <b>supportive</b> care (i. e., dietary care, oncological nursing care, physical therapy, psychological care, or participation in a rehabilitation program consisting of an exercise component and a psycho-educational component) among survivors of colorectal cancer in the Netherlands. METHODS: Cross-sectional data of 3957 survivors of colorectal cancer (1 - 11 years after diagnosis) were used. Clinical data from the Eindhoven Cancer Registry were linked to questionnaire data from the PROFILES registry. Regression analyses were used to examine which predisposing, enabling, and need factors were associated with self-reported utilization <b>of</b> <b>supportive</b> care. RESULTS: Utilization <b>of</b> <b>supportive</b> care was primarily associated with younger age, patient-perceived need (i. e., lower physical health, anxious mood, depressive mood, and fatigue), and clinical need (i. e., tumor stage, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, comorbidity, having a stoma and lower BMI) factors. CONCLUSIONS: In the Netherlands, utilization <b>of</b> <b>supportive</b> care by survivors of colorectal cancer is primarily associated with younger age, patient-perceived need, and clinical need factors. Apart from the association with younger age, the utilization <b>of</b> <b>supportive</b> care services seems to be quite equitable. Further {{research is needed to determine}} whether there is indeed inequity in the provision <b>of</b> <b>supportive</b> care to older survivors, or whether older survivors are less in need <b>of</b> <b>supportive</b> care...|$|R
