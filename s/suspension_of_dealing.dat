40|$|Flows {{which are}} <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> auto-diffeomorphisms of {{manifolds}} are studied in this thesis. The {{structure of the}} product of two such suspended flows is investigated {{and its relation to}} product diffeomorphisms, together with some simple statements concerning Anosov flows are given. A generalization <b>of</b> <b>suspension</b> to <b>deal</b> with any finite number of commuting auto-diffeomorphisms is considered and analogous results to those obtained above are proved together with some additional ones. A functorial representation is given for suspended flows. Other flow invariant operations on manifolds are considered for this class of flows. Also considered are diffeomorphisms with non-wandering sets which have parts homeomorphic to Cantor Sets. The cohomologies of their insets are computed using Cech cohomology theory. This is a first step in the problem of using Morse Theory to obtain Morse-inequalities for Smale diffeomorphisms as defined in the introduction...|$|R
2500|$|The Rover 75 V8 {{was created}} {{as a means of}} proving MG Rover's {{engineering}} expertise and to attract a development partner to the company. The car was extensively re-engineered to accommodate Ford's Modular V8 in 4.6 litre capacity, driving the rear wheels to give a car with much higher performance, taking advantage of the stiffening tunnel in the body structure. These cars were built on the standard production line, and then removed to allow the necessary structural modifications to be carried out. The cars were then returned to the trimming lines for completion. Just under 900 were produced in both saloon and Tourer body styles, carrying either Rover 75 or MG ZT trim. The cars had numerous differences to the standard versions, drive train notwithstanding, with non standard heating and ventilation, and brakes and <b>suspension</b> capable <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> with the extra power [...] Externally, there is little to indicate what is under the bonnet, other than quad exhaust pipes and a couple of subtle badges, although a large 'premium' grille was fitted to some cars following the 2004 facelift.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} five parts.

Part III focuses on how schools implement IDEA and treat special-education students. Part IV explores the disproportionate effects <b>of</b> school <b>suspension</b> on disabled students and explains the negative impacts, such as the Pipeline.

40|$|Arguably, {{eliminating}} <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments [...] {{periods when}} banks jointly refuse to convert their liabilities into outside money or other assets [...] {{was an important}} impetus for creating the Federal Reserve. Friedman and Schwartz suggest that a suspension in 1930 would have decreased {{the severity of the}} Great Depression. More recently, an emerging literature suggests that <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments may well be optimal in some states of the world. We present evidence about <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments from an episode that is close to a controlled experiment for examining their effects. In 1861, about 44 percent of the banks in Wisconsin closed, 81 percent of the banks in Illinois closed, and noteholders suffered substantial losses. The historical record suggests a possible explanation: an effective <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments in Wisconsin but not Illinois. Historical and statistical evidence indicate that the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments decreased the number of banks that closed as well as noteholders' losses.

40|$|Article 27 - 2 of the Penal Code in Japan {{requires}} that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> {{execution of the}} sentence' should be judged in view of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing re-offending'. Some, on the other hand, argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be "balanced" with the criminal responsibility of the offender, which is {{greater than that of}} those whose execution of the sentence is fully suspended and is smaller than that of those whose sentence is partially executed. However, I think that this method of judgment ignores the requirements of Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' and `full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' in order to clarify the image of those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2.
