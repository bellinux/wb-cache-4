40|$|Introduction: Piscirickettsia salmonis (P. salmonis) is the {{aetiological}} bacterium of the {{contagious disease}} piscirickettsiosis or <b>salmonid</b> <b>rickettsial</b> <b>septicaemia</b> (SRS) and causes significant economic losses to aquaculture production in Chile. Current strategies to control infection are i) indiscriminate antibiotic use and ii) vaccination with predominantly P. salmonis bacterin vaccines {{that do not}} provide acceptable levels of protection against piscirickettsiosis. Areas covered: This review covers the basic biology of P. salmonis, clinical piscirickettsiosis and disease control, the development of current P. salmonis vaccines, innate and adaptive immunity and a 5 -year plan to develop new piscirickettsiosis vaccines. Expert commentary: Fundamental knowledge is lacking on the complexities of P. salmonis-host interactions, relating to bacterial virulence and host innate and adaptive immune responses, which needs to be addressed. The development of new P. salmonis vaccines needs the application of comprehensive ‘omics’ technologies to identify candidate vaccine antigens capable of stimulating long-lasting protective immune responses...|$|E

During the seawater growing stage, fish become more susceptible to several types of disease, due to the natural decay of vaccine-induced immune responses. In this study, we demonstrate the immune response and efficacy of a new <b>salmonid</b> <b>rickettsial</b> <b>septicaemia</b> (SRS) oral vaccine, developed using MicroMatrixTM Technology. The vaccine, which is administered together with daily feed ration, induces a specific immune response at local and systemic levels. Anti- Piscirickettsia salmonis specific antibodies were detected as soon as 300 degree-days after vaccination. Furthermore, oral vaccination was able to protect fish against a lethal pathogen challenge when administered either as a primary vaccination or as a booster for an injected vaccine.

40|$|The gram {{negative}} facultative bacterium P. salmonis is the etiological agent of <b>Salmonid</b> <b>Rickettsial</b> <b>Septicaemia</b> (SRS), a severe disease that causes important economic {{losses in the}} global salmon farmer industry. Despite efforts to control this disease, the high frequency of new epizootic events indicate that the vaccine and antibiotics treatments have limited effectiveness, therefore the preventive and diagnostic approaches must be improved. A comparison of several methodologies for SRS diagnostic indicate differences in their specificity and its capacity to detect other bacteria coexisting with P. sairnonis in culture media (contamination) and fish samples (coinfection), aspects relevant for research, vaccine development and clinical diagnostic. By computer-simulation analyses, we identified a group of restriction enzymes that generate unique P. salmonis 16 S rDNA band patterns, distinguishable from all other bacteria. From this information, we designed and developed a PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) assay, which was validated using 16 S rDNA universal primers and restriction enzyme PmaCl for the amplification and digestion, respectively. Experimental validation was performed by comparing the restriction pattern of P. salmon's with the restriction patterns generated by bacteria that cohabit with P. salmonis (fish bacterial isolates and culture media contaminants). Our {{results indicate that the}} restriction enzyme selection pipeline was suitable to design a more specific, sensible, faster and cheaper assay than the currently used P. salmonis detection methodologies.

40|$|Piscirickettsia salmonis is a {{pathogenic}} bacteria {{known as}} the aetiological agent of the <b>salmonid</b> <b>rickettsial</b> syndrome and causes a high mortality in farmed salmonid fishes.

In the search of new alternatives to detect the presence of P. salmonis in salmonid fishes, this work proposed the use of MALDI-TOF-MS to compare serum protein profiles from Salmo salar fish, including experimentally infected and non-infected fishes using principal component analysis (PCA). Samples were obtained from a controlled bioassay where S. salar was challenged with P. salmonis in a cohabitation model and classified according to {{the presence or absence of}} the bacteria by real time PCR analysis.

40|$|P. salmonis, the {{aetiologic}} {{agent of}} <b>salmonid</b> <b>rickettsial</b> <b>septicaemia</b> (SRS), affects {{several species of}} salmonids. Previous reports using the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE) as the criterion for susceptibility, showed that P. salmonis (ATCC strain) can be grown in vitro in some cells lines derived from salmonid fish, but not in BB cells from brown bullhead (I. nebulosus) and BF- 2 cells from bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). The growth of P. salmonis (ATCC strain VR 1361) in a cell line previously believed to be non-permissive for this organism is described. CPE was first detected in chinook salmon embryo (CHSE- 214) and epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cell lines at 6 days after infection (dpi). In contrast, using BB cell line, CPE was first detected 45 dpi and the monolayer completed CPE by 78 dpi. Electron microscopic examination of BB cells 78 dpi showed free, intracytoplasmic and extracellular localization of the agent. P. salmonis was also observed within membrane-bounded vacuoles in BB cells, similar to that described in CHSE 214 cells. Contrary to earlier reports, {{results from this study}} show that the BB cell line, is susceptible to P. salmonis infection. The delayed onset of CPE in BB cells in comparison to other permissive cell lines suggests that BB cells are not ideal hosts for P. salmonis. Interestingly, however, these results demonstrate that P. salmonis can infect non-salmonid cell lines, and raises the possibility that non-salmonid fish may be involved in the persistence and transmission of SRS in the natural environment. ...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIBackground: Piscirickettsiosis or <b>Salmonid</b> <b>Rickettsial</b> <b>Septicaemia</b> (SRS) is a {{bacterial}} disease {{that has a}} major economic impact on the Chilean salmon farming industry. Despite the fact that Piscirickettsia salmonis has been recognized as a major fish pathogen for over 20 years, the molecular strategies underlying the fish response to infection and the bacterial mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. We analysed and compared the head kidney transcriptional response of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) families with different levels of susceptibility to P. salmonis infection in order to reveal mechanisms that might confer infection resistance. Results: We ranked forty full-sibling Atlantic salmon families according to accumulated mortality after a challenge with P. salmonis and selected the families with the lowest and highest cumulative mortalities for microarray gene expression analysis. A comparison of the response to P. salmonis infection between low and high susceptibility groups identified biological processes presumably involved in natural resistance to the pathogen. In particular, expression changes of genes linked to cellular iron depletion, as well as low iron content and bacterial load in the head kidney of fish from low susceptibility families, suggest that iron-deprivation is an innate immunity defence mechanism against P. salmonis. To complement these results, we predicted a set of iron acquisition genes from the P. salmonis genome. Identification of putative Fur boxes and expression of the genes under iron-depleted conditions revealed {{that most of these}} genes form part of the Fur regulon of P. salmonis. Conclusions: This study revealed, for the first time, differences in the transcriptional response to P. salmonis infection among Atlantic salmon families with varied levels of susceptibility to the infection. These differences correlated with changes in the abundance of transcripts encoding proteins directly and indirectly involved in the immune response; changes that highlighted the role of nutritional immunity through iron deprivation in host defence mechanisms against P. salmonis. Additionally, we found that P. salmonis has several mechanisms for iron acquisition, suggesting that this bacterium can obtain iron from different sources, including ferric iron through capturing endogenous and exogenous siderophores and ferrous iron. Our results contribute to determining the underlying resistance mechanisms of Atlantic salmon to P. salmonis infection and to identifying future treatment strategies.

Although the bacteria can be grown in tissue culture cells, genetic analysis of the organism has been hindered because of the difficulty in obtaining P. salmonis DNA free from contaminating host cell DNA. In this report, we describe a novel procedure to purify in vitro-grown bacteria with iodixanol as the substrate to run differential centrifugation gradients which, combined with DNase I digestion, yield enough pure bacteria to do DNA analysis. The efficiency of the purification procedure relies on two main issues: semiquantitative synchrony of the P. salmonis-infected Chinook salmon embryo (CHSE- 214) tissue culture cells and low osmolarity of iodixanol to better resolve bacteria from the membranous structures of the host cell.

Immune sera from rabbits immunized with purified whole cells of P. salmonis reacted with four protein antigens and two carbohydrate antigens with relative molecular sizes of 65, 60, 54, 51, 16, and approximately 11 kDa, respectively. The carbohydrate antigens appear to be mainly core region lipo-oligosaccharide with lesser amounts of lipopolysaccharide. Serum from convalescent rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) reacted with several minor immunoreactive protein antigens between 10 and 70 kDa in size and a carbohydrate antigen with a relative molecular size of approximately 11 kDa. The salmonid immune system did not appear to elicit a strong humoral response against this intracellular pathogen.

40|$|Piscirickettsia salmonis is the {{etiologic}} {{agent of the}} <b>salmonid</b> <b>rickettsial</b> septicemia (SRS) which causes significant losses in salmon production in Chile and other and in other regions in the southern hemisphere. As the killing of phagocytes is an important pathogenic mechanism for other bacteria to establish infections in vertebrates, we investigated whether P. salmonis kills trout macrophages by apoptosis. Apoptosis in infected macrophages was demonstrated by techniques based on morphological changes and host cell DNA fragmentation. Transmission electron microcopy showed classic apoptotic characteristics and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling showed fragmented DNA. Programmed cell death type I was further confirmed by increased binding of annexin V to externalized phosphatidylserine in infected macrophages. Moreover, significant increases of caspase 3 activation were detected in infected cells and treatment with caspase inhibitor caused a decrease in levels of apoptosis. This is the first evidence that P. salmonis induces cell death in trout macrophages. This could lead to bacterial survival and evasion of the host immune response and {{play an important role}} in the establishment of infection in the host.

A comparative genomics strategy was used on a genomic library of Piscirickettsia salmonis in order to select optimal candidates for a recombinant subunit vaccine to protect fish from <b>rickettsial</b> <b>septicaemia</b> (SRS). Based on this information, 15 P. salmonis ORFs encoding heat shock proteins, virulence factors, membrane bound and other surface exposed antigens, were isolated and expressed.

Results. This is the first study differentiating Chilean P. salmonis isolates into two separate genetic groups. Genotyping, based on 16 S rRNA-ITS and concatenated housekeeping genes grouped the selected isolates into two clades, constituted by the Chilean strains, while the Canadian isolates form a branch in the phylogenetic tree.

Little {{is known about}} the infective strategy of P. salmonis, which is able to infect, survive within, and replicate inside salmonid macrophages as an intracellular parasite. Similarly there is little knowledge concerning the fish host's response to invasion by this pathogen. We have examined the transcriptional response of postsmolt Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to P. salmonis at 48 h following infection in three tissues, liver, head kidney, and muscle, using an Atlantic salmon oligonucleotide microarray (Salar_ 2, Agilent 4 x 44 K). The infection led to a large alteration of transcriptional activity in all the tissues studied. In infected salmon 886, 207, and 153 transcripts were differentially expressed in liver, head kidney, and muscle, respectively. Assessment of enrichment for particular biological pathways by gene ontology analysis showed an upregulation of genes involved in oxidative and inflammatory responses in infected fish, indicative of the activation of the innate immune response. The downregulation of genes involved in the adaptive immune response, G protein signaling pathway, and apoptotic process in infected fish may be reflective of mechanisms used by P. salmonis to survive, replicate, and escape host defenses.

The pathogenesis {{of the disease}} has not been fully characterized. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe the hepatic lesions associated with experimental P. salmonis infection in Atlantic salmon juveniles. Fish were maintained in fresh water and inoculated intraperitoneally (IP), orally, or on the gill surface with P. salmonis. A group of uninfected fish was kept as control. Liver samples from 5 fish in each inoculated group and 3 controls were collected weekly and processed for histological and immunohistochemical examination. Thickening of the liver capsule by inflammatory cells was a characteristic histologic feature of IP inoculated fish. Three weeks post-IP inoculation, 8 fish had died and 2 fish were sampled. Histological changes at this time consisted of vasculitis, presence of fibrin thrombi, vacuolated hepatocytes and focal areas of necrosis. Leukocytes containing intracytoplasmic basophilic microorganisms were seen within hepatic sinusoids. Vasculitis and intracytoplasmic vacuoles were prominent features in fish inoculated orally and on the gill surface. The presence of P. salmonis within hepatocellular vacuoles, endothelial cells, and leucocytes was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The intracellular location of P. salmonis and the vascular damage seen in infected fish are characteristic of rickettsial infections. Histological lesions induced by experimental infection with P. salmonis using the oral and gill surface routes were similar to those observed in natural outbreaks of piscirickettsiosis. The tropism of P. salmonis for endothelial cells explains the vascular lesions observed in SRS, whereas hepatic lesions are due to ischemic necrosis and direct injury by intracytoplasmic organisms.

40|$|<b>Salmonid</b> <b>rickettsial</b> septicemia is a serious, {{infectious}} disease in Chilean salmon farming caused by Piscirickettsia salmonis, causing heavy losses to the salmonid industry. P. salmonis {{belongs to the}} Gammaproteobacteria, order Thiotrichales. SRS was first described in Chile in 1989, and infection with P. salmonis has since been described from {{a high number of}} fish species and in several geographic regions globally. P. salmonis infection of salmonids causes multifocal, necrotic areas of internal organs like liver, kidney and spleen. Histologically and immunologically the tissue response is formation of granulomas, often with central suppuration. The exact sequence of infection is not known but bacteria likely gain access to internal organs through mucosal surfaces and when infected, fish carry bacteria in macrophages. It has not been fully determined if the bacterium resides in the cytosol or hide within vesicular structures intracellularly, although there are indications that in vitro infection results in actin reorganization and formation of actin-coated vesicle within which the bacterium resides. Protection against lethal challenge is well documented in lab scale experiments but protection from vaccination has proven more difficult to attain long term under field conditions. Current vaccination protocols include whole cell, inactivated and adjuvanted vaccines for injection for primary immunization followed by oral boost where timing of boost delivery is followed by measuring circulating antibody levels against the pathogen. Documentation also exist that there is correlation between antibody titers and protection against mortality. Future vaccination regimes will likely also include live, attenuated vaccines or other technologies such as DNA vaccination.

Despite efforts to genomically characterize P. salmonis, functional information on the life cycle, pathogenesis mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment, and control of this fish pathogen remain lacking. To address this knowledge gap, the present study conducted an in silico pan-genome analysis of 19 P. salmonis strains from distinct geographic locations and genogroups. Results revealed an expected open pan-genome of 3, 463 genes and a core-genome of 1, 732 genes. Two marked genogroups were identified, as confirmed by phylogenetic and phylogenomic relationships to the LF- 89 and EM- 90 reference strains, {{as well as by}} assessments of genomic structures. Different structural configurations were found for the six identified copies of the ribosomal operon in the P. salmonis genome, indicating translocation throughout the genetic material. Chromosomal divergences in genomic localization and quantity of genetic cassettes were also found for the Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system. To determine divergences between core-genomes, additional pan-genome descriptions were compiled for the so-termed LF and EM genogroups. Open pan-genomes composed of 2, 924 and 2, 778 genes and core-genomes composed of 2, 170 and 2, 228 genes were respectively found for the LF and EM genogroups.

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{aquaculture}} industry, {{and in particular}} of salmonids, has dramatically increased in the last decades to supply the growing worldwide demand for fish products. The expansion of aquaculture needs a good management to ensure the sustainability of this activity. In particular, improving feeds for aquaculture to enhance health and performance of reared fish is imperative for this industry. Molecular biological approacches can help interpret responses to new diets and immune responses. Ubiquitin ligases (UbE 3 s) play {{a pivotal role in}} the ubiquitin proteasome pathway of protein degradation and are markers that could be linked to health and performance of fish. Six UbE 3 s were characterized, 4 are related to muscle catabolism and two involved in NF-kB activation. Atrogin- 1 and MuRF genes were increased following food deprivation and a proinflammatory stimulation. MULAN and Mul 1 b, are mitochondrial activators of NF-kB and the expression of both genes was increased following a proinflammatory immune challenge both in vivo and in vitro. These genes have been used as markers in dietary traits to understand responses. A transcriptome study using Atlantic salmon fed a commercially available functional feed designed for optimal health status compared to a standard feed was performed. Both the liver and muscle were chosen for the transcriptomic analysis. In liver, a number of process were found down regulated, including protein turnover and innate immunity. No significant alterations were found in muscle. To determine the effect of a high plant protein diet (PP), compared to a marine profile diet (MP) in Atlantic a transcriptomic analysis was performed. Fish grew equally well on both diets and no significant histological differences were seen in intestine. The PP diet induced tissue specific changes in gene expression, with the mid intestine showing activation of the adaptive immune response and protein turnover. In liver cell proliferation and apoptosis indicate cellular reorganization and also a general suppression of processes such as immune response was observed. In contrast muscle tissue showed reduced protein metabolism and decrease in immune gene expression suggesting less energy expenditure in this tissue. To assess fish response to Piscirickttsia salmonis, the etiological agent of the <b>salmonid</b> <b>rickettsial</b> seeticemia (SRS), a transcriptomic analysis was carried out. P. salmonis infection has profound effects on transcription in the head kidney, liver and muscle of salmon. Head kidney, liver and muscle tissue showed a decrease in expression of mRNAs related to acquired immune function indicating the pathogen is down regulating this response controlled in part by the inhibition of the G-protein signalling pathway, whereas the innate immune response was increased in head kidney. Liver and muscle also responded, including specific responses in each tissue type. These results improve understanding of the mechanisms by which this bacterium survives and replicates within host cells and may assist selection of molecular biomarkers useful {{for the development of a}} diagnostic tools, vaccines and therapeutants for the aquaculture industry. Using markers selected from the previous experiments, the effect of four different diets, a marine profile diet (MP/FO), a plant protein diet (PP/FO), a vegetable oil diet (MP/VO) and PP/VO diet, in Atlantic salmon were examined. Markers for protein and lipid metabolism and immune response were studied in mid intestine, liver and muscle of fish fed for 77 days the four diets. Small but significant changes were observed, but despite of this, fish fed all the four diets showed similar growth rates. Moreover, to study the possible effect of the diets on fish health, the expression of specific SRS markers was studied in head kidney and liver of fish fed the four diets and infected with P. salmonis. The SRS challenge demonstrated that all groups of fish were able to respond efficiently to the pathogen. In conclusion, these new diets may represent good alternatives to fish meal (FM) and fish oil (FO) diets indicating that a replacement of marine diets with vegetable sources is possible in Atlantic salmon without affecting neither fish growth and performance nor the health of fish. The findings presented in this thesis suggest that E 3 ligases are good molecular markers, allowing to study performance and health of fish following feeding trial and pathogen challenge. In addition, transcriptomic analysis performed to select further key molecular markers involved in a variety of processes and improved our knowledge of fish physiology and immunology, providing useful information for the development of new alternative diets for aquaculture.
