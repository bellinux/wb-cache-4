The PCA index for Paris is estimated and its characteristics and robustness are analyzed depending on estimation period, choice of observations, periodicity and reversibility. It is then compared to a standard repeat <b>sales</b> <b>index</b> (WRS), which was estimated using the same data, and the resulting indices are quite similar except in very particular market circumstances. Finally, contrary to the WRS index, the findings indicate that the PCA index can be efficiently used to forecast apartment prices. ...|$|E

Specifically, the repeat sales measure signals turning points later than the hedonic measure: for example, the hedonic measure of con-dominium prices bottomed out at the beginning of 2002, while the corresponding repeat sales measure exhibits a reversal only in the spring of 2004.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the potential bias induced in {{an index of}} asset prices when sellers use reservation rules that may include some component of private value. We develop a model in which the seller’s asking price is determined by private valuation while the buyer’s bid price {{is determined by the}} market valuation, and a transaction takes place only if the bid is higher than the ask. Therefore, the trading volume and the observed transaction prices are both affected by the ratio of seller’s private valuation to the market valuation, which is called the seller reserve ratio. The higher the seller reserve ratio, the lower is the trading volume and the larger is the difference between the market valuation estimated using observed prices and the actual market valuation. To address the estimation problem posed by the bias, we propose a three step-econometric procedure. We first estimate the unconditional index. We next estimate the average seller reserve ratio and the unconditional population variance of pricing errors. We then use these estimates in step two to correct for the bias in the index based on observed prices in either a hedonic regression or a repeat sale regression. Simulations show that this remedy effectively mitigates the bias. Moreover, the reserve-conditional indices are potentially more accurate than traditional hedonic and repeat <b>sale</b> <b>indices.</b> We apply this technique to Los Angeles housing market, and show that the reserve-conditional index could substantially differ from a traditional repeat <b>sale</b> <b>index.</b> In our application, the reserve-conditional index is more volatile, and appears to capture market downturns in a more timely fashion...|$|R

We use the CD-BIEN database that contains more than 220 000 repeat sales transactions for residential apartments in the Paris area covering the period 1973 - 2001 period. Our PCA index for the Paris and close surrounding area is estimated and its characteristics and robustness are analysed depending on: estimation period, choice of observations, periodicity and reversibility. We then compare it to the traditional WRS repeat <b>sales</b> <b>index</b> developed by Case & Shiller (1987).

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{behavior}} of broker quotes in Korean housing markets by comparing the Kookmin Bank apartment (a condominium in a high- rise residential building) price index, a broker quote based apartment price index, and a repeat <b>sales</b> apartment price <b>index</b> that we built using transaction prices, which have become available since January 2006. Broker quotes may differ from actual prices depending on the housing market conditions. Specifically, we test the hypotheses: (1) price increases shown by the broker quote based apartment price index are greater than those shown by the repeat <b>sales</b> apartment price <b>index</b> in an up market; and (2) the broker quote based price index shows a far less price reduction than the repeat <b>sales</b> price <b>index</b> in a down market. We find that indeed in a down market, the broker quote based price index shows far less price reduction than the repeat <b>sales</b> price <b>index</b> (5. 75 %- 8. 07 %). However, the broker quote based price index does not distort the prices in an up market, where trading volumes are high. It appears that the price inflation in the broker quotes rises as the transaction volume drops. While broker quotes are substantially higher than transaction prices in a down market, the broker sentiment, which is a qualitative assessment of market conditions, {{appears to be more}} in line with transaction prices. We have also documented that the broker quote based index reaches its peak about two months after the peak of the repeat <b>sales</b> based <b>index.</b> Finally, broker quotes are smooth in comparison to transaction prices and they are smoothed more in a down market than an up market. Our results suggest that an optimistic view of broker quotes is problematic only in down markets where trading volumes are limited. The price inflation in broker quotes is a risk to the financial system in a market with only a broker quote based index in that it overstates the collateral values underlying mortgage loans in a down market.
