40|$|AbstractIn the {{water-bearing}} {{soft rock}} strata of West China, a field measurement {{is carried out}} on the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> in bedrock section. The <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> is built with freezing method. From the measurement, some changes of regularity in construction, thawing and post thawing period are obtained, including the temperature, freezing pressure and the vertical and hoop strain of the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining.</b> Measurement studies have shown that: during the plastic stage of shaft construction period, {{with the release of}} hydration heat, the thermal expansion occurs in the concrete and the strain gauge, leading to tensile strain. In the earlier stage, the elastic modulus and strength of concrete increases rapidly. When the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> temperature reaches its maximum, the cooling and growth in the freezing pressure make the hoop strain increase sharply. However, the hoop strain is at lower tensile or compressive value. In the early stage and mature stage, the strain change is mainly affected by temperature. In the thawing and post thawing period, the concrete strain is also primarily influenced by temperature change. During the measurement, when the maximum compressive strain is less than ultimate value, the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> is in a safe state. To ensure the security of the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining,</b> the concrete strength growth and sidewall temperature should be controlled in the similar shaft condition.

The centrifugal compressor is driven via a variable speed electrical motor through a gearbox. The main characteristics of the <b>shaft</b> <b>line</b> are the following: 9 MW electrical motor running from 1250 to 1875 rpm to cover the whole operating speed range of the compressor; Gearbox with a speed ratio of 7. 035; Centrifugal compressor (back to back arrangement) from 72 to 167 bara (first stage) and from 165 to 307 bara (second stage); Low speed and high speed flexible couplings of membrane type technology.

The aerodynamics performances of the compressor were as expected, and the gear box and the compressor did not exhibit any abnormal vibratory behavior.
