25|$|The lack of {{physical}} evidence has led to suggestions that shingle or thatch could have been used, neither of which would leave significant physical remains. Similarly, timber roofs <b>secured</b> with wooden <b>pegs</b> may also have rotted away.|$|R
5000|$|Available {{in rolls}} of various widths, the fleece is laid across sown seedbeds {{or on the}} top of {{juvenile}} plants. If fleece covers rows it is known as a kind of row cover. The edges may be <b>secured</b> with <b>pegs,</b> soil bags, or other weights if the site is small or not too exposed to winds, or buried in slit trenches. It will stretch slightly in use, which allows the plants to grow. For taller plants grown in rows or blocks, heavy-duty fleece can be used to fashion a form of [...] "cloche", i.e. a small tent structure. When used as a protection against wind the fleece is wrapped around, or covered over the delicate plants to protect them from frost and cold wind.|$|R
40|$|Percutaneous {{endoscopic}} gastrostomy (PEG) is {{a proven}} feeding tube, {{just as the}} nasogastric tube is proven {{to be able to}} deliver enteral nutrition. For long-term use, both patient and caregiver want neither. What is desired is the LOOPPEG ® 3 G tube, more <b>secure</b> than the <b>PEG,</b> and less risky to change than the nasogastric tube. Future clinical research should focus on this high-comfort low-risk tube. © 2011 Baishideng. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The Johnsontown Tobacco Barn No. 2 is a {{historic}} tobacco barn in Charles County, Maryland, near La Plata. The barn was built c. 1820, and provides evidence of early use of fire in the tobacco curing process. The framing of the barn is hand-hewn timbers <b>secured</b> by wooden <b>pegs,</b> with pit-sawn secondary framing members. The exterior is sheathed in vertical board siding, although {{there is evidence that}} it was originally sheathed in horizontal siding.|$|R
50|$|The tachi style koshirae is {{the primary}} style of {{mounting}} used for the tachi, where the sword is suspended edge-down from two hangers (ashi) attached to the obi. The hilt often had a slightly stronger curvature than the blade, continuing the classic tachi increase in curvature going from the tip to the hilt. The hilt was usually <b>secured</b> with two <b>pegs</b> (mekugi), as compared to one peg for shorter blades including uchigatana and katana. The tachi style koshirae preceded the uchigatana (katana) style koshirae.|$|R
40|$|A central {{hypothesis}} {{and concern}} of some skeptics of European monetary union is that {{monetary policy coordination}} to <b>secure</b> a <b>peg</b> to the German mark (DM) will tie real economic performance, especially the unemployment rate, to that in Germany. Evidence on this hypothesis {{can be found in}} Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands, however, where currencies have been tightly pegged to the mark since 1979, 1986 and 1984, respectively. This paper reviews the theoretical link between a country's real performance and its coordination with foreign economic policy. It uses the three countries' Phillips curves to gauge real economic performance; it tests whether Phillips curve parameters have shifted adversely following the introduction of the DM-peg and whether any such shift is related to German unemployment rate movements. The article concludes that coordination does not have adverse economic effects on real economic performance. Monetary policy; Austria; Belgium; Netherlands; Foreign exchange rates...|$|R
5000|$|The Mary D. Hume {{was built}} of local timber at Gold Beach. The keel, {{measuring}} 10 in by 36 in by 140 ft long {{was described as}} the [...] "largest stick of square timber ever floated down Rogue River." [...] The ship's knees were hand-cut from local Port Orford cedar roots. Planking was <b>secured</b> with wood <b>pegs.</b> The machinery was salvaged from the wrecked steamer Varuna. The Hume measured 150 tons, 96 ft long by 22 ft beam by 9 ft draft. She was originally rigged as a schooner.|$|R
50|$|The Chimneys' {{floor plan}} has two rooms {{on each side}} of a central hall. The two-story house is framed with heavy timber with mortise and tenon joints <b>secured</b> with {{hardwood}} <b>pegs.</b> Each timber is marked by chiseled Roman numerals. Spaces between wall studs are nogged with brick in the interior and exterior walls. Fredericksburg was a major port city in the colonies in the mid- to late 18th century and The Chimneys' hipped roof framing utilizes techniques common in the construction of ships' hulls at the time. The roof is supported by three heavy king post trusses.|$|R
50|$|The {{house at}} New Farm covered about 30 squares, {{including}} a 6' wide verandah all round. It had four main rooms (which could be subdivided to make eight) and three tokonomas and chigai-tanas. There was an akari shoji (moon window) made by exposing the bamboo frame of a plaster {{wall in the}} suki-ya tradition. The shelves of the chigai-tana were meticulously veneered to avoid exposing end grain. The corner posts and beams of the tokonomas had been chosen from cherrywood, hokki pine or bamboo samples. There were few hand wrought iron nails in the house {{as most of the}} joints were mortised and tenoned and <b>secured</b> with wooden <b>pegs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{rested on}} {{concrete}} and fieldstone footings at each end. As typical for covered bridges, {{it was a}} frame structure with a gabled roof that covered with creosote shingles. Its construction is of the through-truss type, and the trusses are completely sheathed on the outside with rough pine boards. The floor was 14 feet (4 m) wide and 117 feet (36 m) long. All of the truss members and planks, sheeting and other dimension lumber were originally hand hewn and <b>secured</b> with wooden <b>pegs,</b> although the bridge had subsequently been strengthened. The sheeting and roof boards were fastened to the rafters with hand cut nails. The abutments were made of local fieldstone.|$|R
50|$|The surgeon {{may choose}} {{which type of}} {{incision}} and implant to use for the patient’s knee. During the surgery, the surgeon may align the instruments to {{determine the amount of}} bone to remove. The surgeon removes bone from the shin bone (tibia) and thigh bone (femur). The surgeon may decide to check if they removed the proper amount of bone during the surgery. In order {{to make sure that the}} proper size implant is used, a surgeon may choose to use a temporary trial. After making sure the proper size implant is selected, the surgeon will put the implant on the ends of the bone and <b>secure</b> it with <b>pegs.</b> Finally, the surgeon will close the wound with sutures.|$|R
50|$|A {{top rail}} {{across the front}} (north side) of room 2 and the foyer and another across the rear (south side) of room 2 and the foyer tied the {{vertical}} beams all together. Each vertical post had a hand-made mortise at interior ceiling height to receive each ceiling joist, which had a tenon at each end. A wood <b>peg</b> <b>secured</b> each joint. The peg holes were chisel-cut with a square hole by hand, as opposed to round holes made with a drill, indicating construction in early 1800’s. The pegs were hand-formed with an ax from small cut blocks of wood and sized to each hole. Additionally, vertical water saw marks marking are on the vertical posts. Neither the room 2 nor the foyer framing used nails.|$|R
50|$|In 1789-1790, Marmaduke built a {{substantial}} house which apparently {{was designed as}} an inn, trading post and stage coach stop on the road from Washington to Wrightsboro. It had two stories and consisted of two large rooms 20 × 20 feet, one over the other. The inside chimney was flanked on one side by a cupboard {{and on the other}} by a narrow winding staircase. This staircase was peculiar in that at a height of eight feet it made a complete semicircle. Another circular staircase directly above this led into the loft. The roof sloped down directly over the staircase so that one had to crawl in order to enter the loft. The open beams were all hand-hewn, and all joints were mortised and tenoned and <b>secured</b> with wooden <b>pegs.</b> Both rooms were paneled with wide boards of virgin pine, dark brown and mellowed with the passing years. The house is still standing and occupied. It is owned by Ian Mcfie. Before Ian McFie, the home and 540 of the original 600 acre were owned by his father Girdwood Mcfie. Girdwood maintained the farm animals in exactly the same numbers as listed in the inventory of Marmaduke's estate in 1797.|$|R
60|$|The {{forests of}} Ke produce {{magnificent}} timber, tall, straight, and durable, of various qualities, {{some of which}} are said to be superior to the best Indian teak. To make each pair of planks used {{in the construction of the}} larger boats an entire tree is consumed. It is felled, often miles away from the shore, cut across to the proper length, and then hewn longitudinally into two equal portions. Each of these forms a plank by cutting down with the axe to a uniform thickness of three or four inches, leaving at first a solid block at each end to prevent splitting. Along the centre of each plank a series of projecting pieces are left, standing up three or four inches, about the same width, and a foot long; these are of great importance in the construction of the vessel. When a sufficient number of planks have been made, they are laboriously dragged through the forest by three or four men each to the beach, where the boat is to be built. A foundation piece, broad in the middle and rising considerably at each end, is first laid on blocks and properly shored up. The edges of this are worked true and smooth with the adze, and a plank, properly curved and tapering at each end, is held firmly up against it, while a line is struck along it which allows it to be cut so as to fit exactly. A series of auger holes, about as large as one's finger, are then bored along the opposite edges, and pins of very hard wood are fitted to these, so that the two planks are held firmly, and can be driven into the closest contact; and difficult as this seems to do without any other aid than rude practical skill in forming each edge to the true corresponding curves, and in poring the holes so as exactly to match both in position and direction, yet so well is it done that the best European shipwright cannot produce sounder or closer-fitting joints. The boat is built up in this way by fitting plank to plank till the proper height and width are obtained. We have now a skin held together entirely by the hardwood pins connecting the edges of the planks, very strong and elastic, but having nothing but the adhesion of these pins to prevent the planks gaping. In the smaller boats seats, in the larger ones cross-beams, are now fixed. They are sprung into slight notches cut to receive them, and are further secured to the projecting pieces of the plank below by a strong lashing of rattan. Ribs are now formed of single pieces of tough wood chosen and trimmed so as exactly to fit on to the projections from each plank, being slightly notched to receive them, and securely bound to them by rattans passed through a hole in each projecting piece close to the surface of the plank. The ends are closed against the vertical prow and stern posts, and further <b>secured</b> with <b>pegs</b> and rattans, and then the boat is complete; and when fitted with rudders, masts, and thatched covering, is ready to do battle with, the waves. A careful consideration of the principle of this mode of construction, and allowing for the strength and binding qualities of rattan (which resembles in these respects wire rather than cordage), makes me believe that a vessel carefully built in this manner is actually stronger and safer than one fastened in the ordinary way with nails.|$|R
