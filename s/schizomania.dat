40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{hypothesis}} that differences in outcome among affective and non-affective psychoses are associated with differences in the degree of developmental deviance. We conducted a retrospective survey of first contact cases treated over a 20 -year period in a psychiatric hospital serving a catchment area in South London. All patients with non-depressive functional psychoses residing in the catchment area who received their first psychiatric treatment between 1965 and 1984 were included in the study. Cases were classified according to the relative chronicity of their illness into four non-overlapping groups: mania, <b>schizomania,</b> acute schizophrenia and chronic schizophrenia. There was a linear trend in the association between illness chronicity and proxy measures of developmental deviance, such as premorbid unemployment, single status and poor academic achievement. Compared to individuals with mania, schizophrenic patients had a 3 – 6 times increased risk of premorbid abnormality. For patients with <b>schizomania</b> and acute schizophrenia, the risk was 1. 5 – 3 times greater than for manic subjects. We conclude that the prevalence of premorbid abnormalities is highest among chronic schizophrenia, but similar disturbances also occur, to a lesser degree, in less disabling affective and non-affective psychotic disorders...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Novel {{antipsychotics}} {{are increasingly}} {{used in the}} treatment of bipolar and schizoaffective mania. This paper presents an overview of the controlled studies in this field. Method: Using cross-references, a computerized search was performed on MEDLINE and EMBASE psychiatry covering the period 1990 - 2002. Results: Olanzapine and risperidone, added to mood stabilizers, and olanzapine as monotherapy enjoy the most evidential support in terms of efficacy and side-effect profile for their use in acute bipolar mania. The use of modern antipsychotics in bipolar prophylaxis and in both the short- and long-term treatment of <b>schizomania</b> has not been widely studied yet. Conclusion: More controlled trials are still needed comparing modern antipsychotics as monotherapy and adjunctive to mood stabilizers with conventional antipsychotics, lithium, anticonvulsants and with each other in short-term and, especially, maintenance treatment of (schizo) mania. Partly based on controlled studies, olanzapine, risperidone and other modern antipsychotics could become preferable for these indications...|$|E
