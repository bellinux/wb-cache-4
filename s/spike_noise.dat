Used of {{the element}} {{enrichment}} model, the multifractal {{detrended fluctuation analysis}} (MF-DFA) is applied to analyze the multifractal property for sequences which were added stochastic noise and <b>spike</b> <b>noise,</b> and then we discuss the noise effect on the scaling exponent.

30|$|In {{addition}} to flux jumps, raw pass-through paleomagnetic measurement may also contain spike noises. Different to flux jumps after which magnetic moment level {{does not go}} back to a previous level, <b>spike</b> <b>noise</b> is a sudden change in magnetic moment at a measurement position, after which the magnetic moment level goes back to that prior to the <b>spike</b> <b>noise.</b> At measurement positions with <b>spike</b> <b>noise,</b> measurement values are apparently distinct from the average values of the surrounding measurement positions. Flux jumps and spike noises both significantly affect the resulting paleomagnetic measurement, and measurements containing flux-jumps or spike noises need to be repeated or corrected before any paleomagnetic interpretation or deconvolution can be made (e.g., Oda and Shibuya 1996). The UPmag software (Xuan and Channell 2009) provides convenient tools to check pass-through paleomagnetic measurement data and correct for flux jumps. We recommend using the UPmag software to check and correct pass-through paleomagnetic measurement data before deconvolution analysis.|$|E

In this paper we present an algorithm based on density estimation techniques that applies an energy preserving adaptive kernel filter to individual samples during image rendering. The used kernel widths diminish as the number of samples goes up, ensuring a reasonable noise versus bias trade-off at any time. This results in a progressive algorithm, that still converges asymptotically to a correct solution. Results show that general noise as well as <b>spike</b> <b>noise</b> can effectively be reduced.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} general {{analysis}} of highly con-nected recurrent neural networks which {{are able to}} learn and retrieve {{a finite number of}} static patterns. The arguments are based on spike trains and their interval distribution and require no specific model of a neuron. In particular, they apply to formal two-state neurons as well as to more refined models like the integrate-and-fire neuron or the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. We show that the mean firing rate defined as the inverse of the mean interval ength is the only relevant parameter (apart from the synaptic weights) that determines the existence of retrieval solutions with a large overlap with one of the learnt patterns. The statistics of the <b>spiking</b> <b>noise</b> (Gaussian, Poisson or other) and hence the shape of the interval distribution does not matter. Thus our unifying approach explains why, and when, all the different associative networks which treat static patterns yield basically the same results, i. e., belong to the same universality class...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} noise in Monte-Carlo {{rendering}} arising from estimator variance is well-known and well-studied. In this work, we concentrate on identifying individual light paths as outliers {{that lead to}} significant <b>spikes</b> of <b>noise</b> and represent a challenge for existing filtering methods. Most noise-reduction methods, such as importance sampling and stratification, attempt to generate samples that are expected a priori to have lower variance, but do {{not take into account}} actual sample values. While these methods are essential to decrease overall noise, we show that filtering samples a posteriori allows for greater reduction of <b>spiked</b> <b>noise.</b> In particular, given evaluated sample values, outliers can be identified and removed. Conforming with conventions in statistics, we emphasize that the term “outlier ” should not be taken as synonymous with “incorrect”, but as referring to samples that distort the empirically-observed distribution of energy relative to the true underlying distribution. By expressing a path distribution in joint image and color space, we show how outliers can be characterized by their density across the set of all nearby paths in this space. We show that removing these outliers leads to significant improvements in rendering quality.
