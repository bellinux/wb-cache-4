50|$|The term {{aliasing}} is {{also used}} to describe the situation where, due to either a hardware design choice or a hardware failure, {{one or more of the}} available address bits is not used in the memory selection process. This may be a design decision if there are more address bits available than are necessary to support the installed memory device(s). In a failure, one or more address bits may be <b>shorted</b> <b>together,</b> or may be forced to ground (logic 0) or the supply voltage (logic 1).|$|E
50|$|In these cases, {{the purpose}} of the star quad {{configuration}} is reversed. The star-quad geometry cancels the magnetic fields that are produced by the two pairs of conductors. This cancellation reduces the magnetic emissions of the cable. To work properly, the cable must be wired in the same fashion as the microphone cable example above. Wires {{on opposite sides of the}} star must be <b>shorted</b> <b>together</b> at each end of the cable. This means that 4 conductors are required for a two-wire circuit. Furthermore, this scheme only works if the two pairs of conductors carry equal and opposite currents.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{the other}} two weapons, {{there is very little}} {{difference}} between an electric sabre and a steam or dry (non-electric) one. The blade itself is the same in steam and electric sabres, as {{there is no need for}} a blade wire or pressure-sensitive tip in an electric sabre. An electric sabre has a socket, which is generally a 2-prong or bayonet foil socket with the two contacts <b>shorted</b> <b>together.</b> The electric sabre also has insulation on the pommel and on the inside of the guard to prevent an electrical connection between the sabre and the lamé. This is undesirable because it effectively extends the lamé onto the sabre, causing any blade contact to be registered as a valid touch.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hot shoe}} is shaped {{somewhat}} like an inverted, squared-off [...] "U" [...] of metal. The matching adapter {{on the bottom}} of the flash unit slides in from the back of the camera and is sometimes secured by a clamping screw on the flash. In the center of the [...] "U" [...] is a metal contact point. This is used for standard, brand-independent flash synchronization. Normally the metal of the shoe and the metal of the contact are electrically isolated from each other. To fire the flash, these two pieces are <b>shorted</b> <b>together.</b> The flash unit sets up a circuit between shoe and contact—when it is completed by the camera, the flash fires.|$|E
50|$|Repulsion motors are wound-rotor {{single-phase}} AC motors {{that are}} a type of induction motor. In a repulsion motor, the armature brushes are <b>shorted</b> <b>together</b> rather than connected in series with the field, as is done with universal motors. By transformer action, the stator induces currents in the rotor, which create torque by repulsion instead of attraction as in other motors. Several types of repulsion motors have been manufactured, but the repulsion-start induction-run (RS-IR) motor has been used most frequently. The RS-IR motor has a centrifugal switch that shorts all segments of the commutator so that the motor operates as an induction motor once it is close to full speed. Some of these motors also lift the brushes out of contact with source voltage regulation. Repulsion motors were developed before suitable motor starting capacitors were available, and few repulsion motors are sold as of 2005.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a second}} problem with this simple pole design. At the zero-torque position, both {{commutator}} brushes are touching (bridging) both commutator plates, resulting in a short-circuit. The power leads are <b>shorted</b> <b>together</b> through the commutator plates, and the coil is also short-circuited through both brushes (the coil is shorted twice, once through each brush independently). Note that this problem is independent of the non-starting problem above; {{even if there were}} a high current in the coil at this position, there would still be zero torque. The problem here is that this short uselessly consumes power without producing any motion (nor even any coil current.) In a low-current battery-powered demonstration this short-circuiting is generally not considered harmful. However, if a two-pole motor were designed to do actual work with several hundred watts of power output, this shorting could result in severe commutator overheating, brush damage, and potential welding of the brushes—if they were metallic—to the commutator. Carbon brushes, which are often used, would not weld. In any case, a short like this is very wasteful, drains batteries rapidly and, at a minimum, requires power supply components to be designed to much higher standards than would be needed just to run the motor without the shorting.|$|E

40|$|A {{new class}} of {{high-voltage}} semiconductor devices, known as a reverse conducting IGBT (RC-IGBT), has emerged in recent years from research efforts to diminish the usage of external anti-parallel free-wheeling diode chips for IGBT switching applications. The RC-IGBT device concept {{is based on the}} monolithic integration of a freewheeling diode into an IGBT chip. Hereby, an anti-parallel diode is formed through the embedment of an n+ region in an anode/collector region of the IGBT. Both the n+ region and the p+ anode are then <b>shorted</b> <b>together</b> by an anode/collector contact. Although the RC-IGBT has many advantages over the conventional IGBT, especially in terms of manufacturing cost, total chip size and reliability of power modules, it is detrimental to the snapback effect at forward conduction o...|$|E

The equivalent impedance at pantograph terminals and the disturbances on the track circuits caused by trains harmonic current injection are evaluated by using reduced models and taking into account several train positions along the railway line.
