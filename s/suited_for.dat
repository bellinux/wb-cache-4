5|$|Agitos {{original}} {{release was}} plagued with multiple issues including long load times, which the team sought to rectify through updates. After the initial release, a Club Activities system {{was going to}} be added. Similar to the Guilds of previous games, players could ally with them, engage in activities unique to the clubs and compete with rival clubs in contests. From the end of July to mid August during the game's original release, it was featured in a crossover with Rise of Mana, a mobile installment in Square Enix's Mana series. An earlier collaboration was also staged between Agito and Square Enix Legend World, a Japan-exclusive browser game. Eventually, it was determined by the developers that Agito was no longer <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> continued updates. The game was shut down on November 30, 2015. As part of its announcement of the game's shutdown, Square Enix said that a new updated version was being prepared that would be better <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> further updates and improved player experience. This updated version was revealed to be Final Fantasy Type-0 Online, a 2016 multiplayer game for similar platforms to Agito.|$|E
