Lydia Lunch started incorporating spoken word with punk rock and Mars explored new sliding guitar techniques. Arto Lindsay neglected to use any kind of musical practise or theory to develop an idiosyncratic atonal playing technique. DNA and James Chance are other famous no wave artists. Chance later on moved more up to Free improvisation. The No Wave movement was closely related to transgressive art and, just like Fluxus, often mixed performance art with music.

Although she said that his lyrics tended towards commonplace country topics such as [...] "patriotism, family, southern pride, faith, and love," [...] she said that the songs were [...] "simple but profoundly observant" [...] and that Morgan's voice recalled Randy Travis. Phillips cited [...] "Lookin' Back with You" [...] as one of the strongest lyrics that Morgan had written, and noted his [...] "almost-power ballad" [...] performance on [...] "Love Remembers."

Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass and drums and one or more singers. Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. <b>Like</b> <b>pop</b> <b>music,</b> lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.|$|R

50|$|This {{song was}} revived, at Koch’s initiative, {{by the old}} men of Niutuao. They {{considered}} this song as an ancient legacy of their ancestors. Tinilau Matolu, an 83-year-old man (born around 1877), {{said that he had}} learned it in 1902 from Kaisami, Tepae, Temaalo and Poulasi, who were older than he is. The song was rehearsed for 11 days by Tinilau and his old friends whose age averaged 67. They set it to a fast rhythm in three verses with fast clapping in support of the song. The final version was sung on 13 September by 18 men (their average age was 56) with Katea (52 years of age and who had visited Samoa and Fiji Islands as crew member of a ship) in the lead. They recorded the song with great verve and enthusiasm. The song became a rage, <b>like</b> <b>pop</b> <b>music,</b> among both old and young people of Niutao, including children, for several months.

50|$|British <b>pop</b> <b>music</b> {{is popular}} music, {{produced}} commercially in the United Kingdom. It {{emerged in the}} mid-to late 1950s as a softer alternative to rock 'n' roll and later to rock <b>music.</b> <b>Like</b> American <b>pop</b> <b>music</b> it has a focus on commercial recording, often orientated towards a youth market, {{as well as that}} of the Singles Chart usually through the medium of relatively short and simple love songs.
