25|$|The primary {{antibody}} can be probed {{for using a}} broader species-specific <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> that is labeled using an enzyme, or fluorophore.|$|E
25|$|A third {{alternative}} {{is to use a}} radioactive label rather than an enzyme coupled to the <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody,</b> such as labeling an antibody-binding protein like Staphylococcus Protein A or Streptavidin with a radioactive isotope of iodine. Since other methods are safer, quicker, and cheaper, this method is now rarely used; however, an advantage of this approach is the sensitivity of auto-radiography-based imaging, which enables highly accurate protein quantification when combined with optical software (e.g. Optiquant).|$|E
25|$|The {{colorimetric}} {{detection method}} depends on incubation {{of the western}} blot with a substrate that reacts with the reporter enzyme (such as peroxidase) that is bound to the <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody.</b> This converts the soluble dye into an insoluble form of a different color that precipitates next to the enzyme and thereby stains the membrane. Development of the blot is then stopped by washing away the soluble dye. Protein levels are evaluated through densitometry (how intense the stain is) or spectrophotometry.|$|E
30|$|After the {{synthesis}} of QDs, 50 μL of 2 mg/mL QDs and 400 μL of 2 mg/mL sheep-anti-human <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> were mixed, and then 300 μL of 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide EDC (44 mM in borate buffer) were added and blended by vortex. The resulting solution was allowed to react {{at room temperature for}} 1 h with continuous mixing and then at 4 °C for 24 h. The overnight QDs-labeled <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> were centrifuged at 12, 000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was discarded. PBST was used to resuspend and wash QDs-labeled <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> by centrifugation at 12, 000 rpm for three times. Finally, the QDs-labeled <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> were dispersed in PBST and kept at 4 °C until use.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> can be {{conjugated}} to enzymes such as {{horseradish peroxidase}} (HRP) or alkaline phosphatase (AP); or fluorescent dyes such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), rhodamine derivatives, Alexa Fluor dyes; or other molecules {{to be used}} in various applications. <b>Secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> are used in many biochemical assays [...] including: ...|$|R
5000|$|Enzyme-linked <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{are applied}} as {{detection}} antibodies that also bind {{specifically to the}} antibody's Fc region (nonspecific).|$|R
25|$|To {{create a}} western blot, gel {{electrophoresis}} {{is used to}} separate native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by {{the length of the}} polypeptide. Polyacrylamide gel is generally used for the electrophoretic separation of proteins, and SDS is generally used as a buffer (as well as in the gel) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge, since proteins can be positively, negatively, or neutrally charged. This type of electrophoresis is known as SDS-PAGE (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Prior to electrophoresis, protein samples are often boiled to denature the proteins present. This ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) from degrading samples. Following electrophoretic separation, the proteins are transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF), where they are blocked with milk (or other blocking agents) to prevent non-specific antibody binding, and then stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. Lastly, the membrane will be stained with a <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> that recognizes the first antibody staining, which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods. The gel electrophoresis step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies.|$|E
2500|$|Synthetic or animal-derived {{antibodies}} {{are created}} that react {{with a specific}} target protein. The sample material undergoes [...] protein denaturation, followed by gel electrophoresis. Next, the electrophoresis membrane is washed in a solution containing the specific antibody. The excess antibody is then washed off, and a <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> that reacts with the first antibody is added. Through various methods such as staining, immunofluorescene, and radioactivity, the <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> can then allow visuallisation of the protein.|$|E
2500|$|After rinsing the {{membrane}} to remove unbound primary antibody, {{the membrane}} {{is exposed to}} another antibody, directed at a species-specific portion of the primary antibody. Antibodies come from animal sources (or animal sourced hybridoma cultures); an anti-mouse secondary will bind to almost any mouse-sourced primary antibody, which allows some cost savings by allowing an entire lab to share a single source of mass-produced antibody, and provides far more consistent results. This {{is known as a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody,</b> and due to its targeting properties, tends to be referred to as [...] "anti-mouse", [...] "anti-goat", etc. [...] The <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> is usually linked to biotin or a reporter enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase. This means that several secondary antibodies will bind to one primary antibody and enhance the signal.|$|E
50|$|Those {{particles}} {{themselves are}} biologically inactive except for serving as antigens against the primary antibodies or as carriers of the antigens. When antibodies {{are used in}} the preparation, they are bound to the erythrocyte or particles in their Fab regions. Thus the step follows requires the <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> against those primary antibodies, that is, the <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> must have binding specificity to the primary antibodies including to their Fc regions.|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} of HAMA can complicate laboratory measurements. HAMA interference's can give false {{positive or negative}} immunoassay results. HAMA bridging interference produces artificially higher results because HAMA's bind to immobilized mouse antibodies in place of substrate, <b>secondary</b> labeled <b>antibodies</b> will then bind to HAMA and produce a positive signal falsely indicative of substrate presence. In this manner, HAMA provides a bridge between immobilized <b>antibodies</b> and labeled <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies.</b> In contrast, HAMA blocking interference produces no signal for substrate presence when substrate is present. HAMA's will capture immobilized mouse antibodies. In the heterogenous immunoassay the separation step will wash away the free substrate unable to bind due to HAMA blocking; only the immobilized mouse antibodies and the HAMA remain in the immunoassay when the labeled <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> are administered. Since the substrate {{will no longer be}} able to bind to the immobilized mouse antibodies because of HAMA interference, labeled <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> will not give a signal for substrate presence.|$|R

2500|$|Another {{method of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> {{detection}} utilizes a near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore-linked antibody. The light produced from the excitation of a fluorescent dye is static, making fluorescent detection {{a more precise}} and accurate measure {{of the difference in}} the signal produced by labeled antibodies bound to proteins on a western blot. [...] Proteins can be accurately quantified because the signal generated by the different amounts of proteins on the membranes is measured in a static state, as compared to chemiluminescence, in which light is measured in a dynamic state.|$|E
2500|$|Chemiluminescent {{detection}} methods depend on incubation {{of the western}} blot with a substrate that will luminesce when exposed to the reporter on the <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody.</b> The light is then detected [...] by CCD cameras which capture a digital image of the western blot or photographic film. The use of film for western blot detection is slowly disappearing because of non linearity of the image (non accurate quantification). The image is analysed by densitometry, which evaluates the relative amount of protein staining and quantifies the results in terms of optical density. Newer software allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis if appropriate standards are used.|$|E
50|$|To detect those human antibodies, {{the array}} {{is covered with}} a {{solution}} of a fluorescently labeled <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody.</b> This <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> binds to the patient antibody already on the array from the diluted serum sample, and since this <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> is fluorescently labeled, it is detectable using fluorescence microscopy. After the microarray is washed to remove unbound <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody,</b> and dried via centrifugation, it is scanned using fluroescence microscopy, and the pattern of peptide spots with bound antibodies versus those without antibodies becomes visible. This pattern is called the immunosignature.|$|E
30|$|Organelles and cytoplasmic {{structures}} of living parenchyma cells in sapwood of 2 -year-old E. bosistoana trees were visualised by immunolabelling. Fixation, extraction and labelling procedures {{were based on}} conventional immunofluorescence imaging methods (Collings and Wasteneys, 2005) that were modified to work with radial wood sections. Immunolabelling was screened visually using fluorescence from fluorescein-tagged <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies,</b> but the high autofluorescence at these wavelengths (Fig.  3) prompted the simultaneous use of two secondary antibodies, with confocal imaging conducted in the far-red with Cy 5 -tagged <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies.</b>|$|R
30|$|Condensed {{medium or}} homogenized tissues were {{collected}} and lysed. The heat-denatured samples were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE gel. When the electrophoresis was ended, the protein samples in the gel were transferred onto PVDF membranes (Roche). Membranes were blocked in 5  % non-fat milk in Tris-buffer saline with 0.1  % Tween- 20, and further incubated with primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{to detect the}} presence of different proteins and visualized by chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). Antibodies against Flag (Sigma-Aldrich) and α-tubulin (Cell signaling technology) were used. Corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> were purchased from Invitrogen.|$|R
30|$|Cells {{were fixed}} and treated as {{described}} in (Ma and Baumgartner 2014). Primary antibodies were diluted 1 : 200 and incubated overnight at 4 °C: α-phospho-c-Met (# 44888, Life Technologies), c-Met (3148), CD 44 (3578) (Cell Signaling), α-tubulin (T 9026, Sigma-Aldrich), Alexa 488 - (A 12379, Life Technologies), Cy 3 - (711 - 165 - 152), and Cy 5 -coupled (415 - 175 - 166) <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> were used (Jackson Immuno Research). <b>Secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-coupled phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted 1 : 500. Images were acquired on an Axioskop 2 mot plus fluorescence microscope (Zeiss).|$|R
50|$|Example 3. An {{untagged}} {{primary antibody}} is detected using a general <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> that recognises all antibodies originating from same animal species as the primary. The <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> is tagged with the peroxidase enzyme.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> is {{especially}} efficient in immunolabeling. Secondary antibodies bind to primary antibodies, which are directly {{bound to the}} target antigen(s). In immunolabeling, the primary antibody's Fab domain binds to an antigen and exposes its Fc domain to <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody.</b> Then, the secondary antibody's Fab domain binds to the primary antibody's Fc domain. Since the Fc domain is constant within the same animal class, only one type of <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> is required to bind to many types of primary antibodies. This reduces the cost by labeling only one type of <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody,</b> rather than labeling various types of primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies help increase sensitivity and signal amplification due to multiple secondary antibodies binding to a primary antibody.|$|E
50|$|The {{indirect}} method involves an unlabeled primary antibody (first layer) that binds {{to the target}} antigen in the tissue and a labeled <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> (second layer) that reacts with the primary antibody. As mentioned above, the <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> must be raised against the IgG of the animal species in which the primary antibody has been raised. This method is more sensitive than direct detection strategies because of signal amplification due to the binding of several secondary antibodies to each primary antibody if the <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> is conjugated to the fluorescent or enzyme reporter.|$|E
40|$|Molecular weight markers {{that can}} {{tolerate}} denaturing conditions and be auto-detected by <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> offer great efficacy and convenience for Western Blotting. Here, we describe M&R LE protein markers which contain linear epitopes {{derived from the}} heavy chain constant regions of mouse and rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG Fc LE). These markers can be directly recognized and stained by {{a wide range of}} anti-mouse and anti-rabbit <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies.</b> We selected three mouse (M 1, M 2 and M 3) linear IgG 1 and three rabbit (R 1, R 2 and R 3) linear IgG heavy chain epitope candidates based on their respective crystal structures. Western blot analysis indicated that M 2 and R 2 linear epitopes are effectively recognized by anti-mouse and anti-rabbit <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies,</b> respectively. We fused the M 2 and R 2 epitopes (M&R LE) and incorporated the polypeptide in a range of 15 - 120 kDa auto-detecting markers (M&R LE protein marker). The M&R LE protein marker can be auto-detected by anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> in standard immunoblots. Linear regression analysis of the M&R LE protein marker plotted as gel mobility versus the log of the marker molecular weights revealed good linearity with a correlation coefficient R 2 value of 0. 9965, indicating that the M&R LE protein marker displays high accuracy for determining protein molecular weights. This accurate, regular and auto-detected M&R LE protein marker may provide a simple, efficient and economical tool for protein analysis...|$|R

Next, a <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> which has gold particles attached is added, and it binds to the primary antibody. Gold can also be attached to protein A or protein G instead of a <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody,</b> as these proteins bind mammalian IgG Fc regions in a non-specific way.|$|E

40|$|Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a {{valuable}} technique utilized to localize/visualize protein expression in a mounted tissue section using specific antibodies. There are two methods: the direct and indirect method. In this experiment, we will only describe the use of indirect IHC staining. Indirect IHC staining utilizes highly specific primary and biotin-conjugated <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Primary antibodies are utilized to discretely identify proteins of interest by binding to a specific epitope, while <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> subtract for non-specific background staining and amplify signal by forming complexes to the primary antibody. Slides can either be generated from frozen sections, or paraffin embedded sections mounted on glass slides. In this protocol, we discuss the preparation of paraffin-embedded sections by dewaxing, hydration using an alcohol gradient, heat induced antigen retrieval, and blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity and non-specific binding sites. Some sections are then stained with antibodies specific for T cell marker CD 8 and while others are stained for tyrosine hydroxylase. The slides are subsequently treated with appropriate <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> conjugated to biotin, then developed utilizing avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with Diaminiobenzidine (DAB) as substrate. Following development, the slides are counterstained for contrast, and mounted under coverslips with permount. After adequate drying, these slides are then ready for imaging...|$|R

50|$|For {{immunohistochemical}} detection strategies, antibodies {{are classified}} as primary or secondary reagents. Primary antibodies are raised against an antigen of interest and are typically unconjugated (unlabeled), while secondary antibodies are raised against immunoglobulins of the primary antibody species. The <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> is usually conjugated to a linker molecule, such as biotin, that then recruits reporter molecules, or the <b>secondary</b> <b>antibody</b> itself is directly bound to the reporter molecule.|$|E

5000|$|A direct {{fluorescent}} antibody (DFA or dFA), {{also known as}} [...] "direct immunofluorescence", is an antibody that has been tagged in a direct {{fluorescent antibody}} test.

40|$|Microarrayed antigens {{are used}} for {{identifying}} serum antibodies with given specificities and for generating binding profiles. Antibodies bind to these arrayed antigens forming immune complexes and are conventionally identified by <b>secondary</b> labelled <b>antibodies.</b> In the body immune complexes are identified by bone marrow derived phagocytic cells, such as monocytes. In our work we were looking into the possibility of replacing <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies</b> with monocytoid cells for the generation of antibody profiles. Using the human monocytoid cell line U 937, which expresses cell surface receptors for immune complex components, we show that cell adhesion is completely dependent on the interaction of IgG heavy chains and Fcc receptors, and this recognition is susceptible to differences between heavy chain structures and their glycosylation. We also report data on a possible application of this system in autoimmune diagnostics. Compared to <b>secondary</b> <b>antibodies,</b> fluorescent monocytesas biosensors are superior in reflecting biological functions of microarray-bound antibodies and represent an easy and robust alternative for profiling interactions between serum proteins and antigens...|$|R
