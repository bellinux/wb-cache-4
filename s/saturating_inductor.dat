The resulting differential equation G (˙x) ¨x+βx+γ ˙x−f(t) = 0 describes approximately an electronic system known as the <b>saturating</b> <b>inductor</b> circuit. For any periodic orbit of the unperturbed system we provide conditions which give rise to the appearance of subharmonic solutions. Furthermore we show that other bifurcation phenomena arise, as there is a periodic solution with the same period as the forcing function f(t) which branches off the origin when the perturbation is switched on. We also show that such a solution, which encircles the origin, attracts the entire phase space when the dissipative parameter becomes large enough. We then compute numerically the basins of attraction of the attractive periodic solutions by choosing specific examples of the forcing function f(t), which are dictated by experience. We provide evidence showing that all the dynamics of the <b>saturating</b> <b>inductor</b> circuit is organised by the persistent subharmonic solutions and by the periodic solution around the origin. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} impedance of a kicker magnet {{system for the}} proposed KAON factory has been measured from 0. 3 to 200 MHz. The measurement was done by trans-forming the kicker magnet under test into a coaxial line {{in order to measure}} the transmission parameter, 5 ’ 21 through the line. The measurement was performed in two fre-quency ranges. From 0. 3 to 50 MHz the magnet was trans-formed into a 50 Q coaxial line, and from 45 to 200 MHz into a 180 R coaxial line. Resonances in the longitudi-nal impedance spectrum are due to the electrical resonant modes of the kicker magnet system. The effect on the lon-gitudinal impedance of a speed-up network and a saturat-ing inductor, installed on the input to the kicker magnet to improve it,s kick performance, was determined. The speed-up network can damp some of the resonances whereas the <b>saturating</b> <b>inductor</b> can eliminate the resonances due to the input cable of the kicker magnet. Above 45 MHz where at-tenuation in the LC cells of the kicker magnet is strong, external components connected to the kicker magnet have negligible influence on the {{longitudinal impedance}}. Hence the longitudinal impedance spectrum of the kicker magnet in the 45 to 200 MHz frequency range does not depend on external components such as the speed-up network, the <b>saturating</b> <b>inductor</b> and the input and output cables.

40|$|Ferrite {{inductors}} {{operation in}} partial saturation offers unexplored opportunities {{in reducing the}} size of magnetic parts and the power losses in High-Current-Ripple Switching Mode Power Supplies (HCR SMPSs) using SiC and GaN devices. A reliable prediction of the inductor current ripple is required to exploit such opportunities. A new method for ripple analysis of <b>saturated</b> <b>inductors</b> has been recently proposed, allowing the investigation of effective SMPS design solutions with minimum size inductors. An extension of such method is herein presented, allowing design investigations for the reliable use of partially <b>saturated</b> ferrite <b>inductors</b> in HCR SMPS applications.

5000|$|Nonlinearity: If {{the current}} through a {{ferromagnetic}} core coil is high {{enough that the}} magnetic core saturates, the inductance will not remain constant but will change with the current through the device. This is called nonlinearity and results in distortion of the signal. For example, audio signals can suffer intermodulation distortion in <b>saturated</b> <b>inductors.</b> To prevent this, in linear circuits the current through iron core inductors must be limited below the saturation level. Some laminated cores have a narrow air gap in them for this purpose, and powdered iron cores have a distributed air gap. This allows higher levels of magnetic flux and thus higher currents through the <b>inductor</b> before it <b>saturates.</b>|$|R
40|$|Kicker magnets {{are used}} for {{injection}} and extraction in the CERN PS. The addition of the LHC facility to the complex of accelerators at CERN requires an improved performance of the existing kicker magnet systems in the CERN PS. The injection kicker field must rise and fall from approximately 1 % to 99 % of full strength during the 96 ns time interval between bunches, whereas the extrac-tion kicker field must rise from approximately 0. 5 % to 99. 5 % of full strength during a gap of 121 ns created in the beam. The kicker magnet systems require pulse forming network (PFN) voltages of up to 80 kV. Dis-placement current arising from the turn-on of a multi-gap thyratron can significantly increase the effective rise-time of the kick. <b>Saturating</b> <b>inductors</b> {{can be used to}} reduce both the effect of the displacement current and the rise-time of the main current pulse. This paper describes the results of measurements on a system which includes satu-rating inductors. Some of the measurements are compared with theoretical predictions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{exploitation}} of partially <b>saturated</b> <b>inductors</b> in Switching Mode Power Supply (SMPS) {{is a key}} strategy for reducing the size of SMPS and increasing their power density [1]. However an accurate characterization and modellization of each inductor is needed for a correct design {{and control of the}} SMPS [2]. Most of inductors’ datasheets only indicate the nominal inductance at low current. Anyway, when the inductor is subjected to a higher current, the value of the inductance is lessened. Moreover, inductance meters often actuate their measurements at no or moderate DC bias. In this work we describe the realization of an automated test bench (Fig. 1) for characterizing an inductor under variable current levels, moving its operating point form the linear region to the partial saturation region [3]. The core of the measurement setup is a simple buck converter, used for applying a square wave voltage to the inductor under test (Fig. 1). The current flowing through the inductor is measured by a Hall-effect current transducer. In order to measure the inductance at different values of the DC bias current, a constant current sink is placed after the LC filter as a variable load. The measurement is carried out by exploiting the inductor constitutive equation VL = L dIL/dt, rewritten as: L = VL / (dIL/dt). For small current variations, the value of L can be considered constant and depending only on the average current. The DC bias current, the frequency and duty-cycle of the switching element can be controlled by a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW, which also takes care of data acquisition and post elaboration (Fig. 2). Several inductors have been tested using the described setup. Figure 3 shows a typical plot of the inductance L versus the inductor current IL. The inductor under test has a rated value of 470 μH. The partial saturation of the inductor is quite evident. Reproducibility tests have been performed on the system, by comparing the results of several measurements on the same inductor. Standard deviation bars, indicated in the plot, show the acceptable precision of the method, the results being well within 1...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the properties of a magnetically delayed pseudospark switch (PSS). One of the challenges of all low pressure gas discharge switches is {{the reduction of the}} lifetime due to commutation losses resulting in anode heating. This effect can be minimized by carefully dimensioning the saturating inductors. For many decades, this method has been successfully used for thyratrons. In principle, a <b>saturating</b> <b>inductor</b> prevents current flow {{until the end of the}} commutation phase. In contrast to thyratrons a PSS is based on a cold cathode electrode. To reach the low-resistive phase in a PSS, a significant current flow is necessary to allow self-heating of the cathode. A useful compromise has to be found to fulfill these opposing needs. The test setup is shown in Figure 1. Different saturating inductors are connected in series with the PSS, on the anode side. Three different designs of the FINEMET (FT- 3 H) pulsed power core types were used. These cores use a thin ceramic insulation to provide a high break down voltage. The properties of the tested saturating inductors are summarized below...|$|E
