50|$|Rate-adaptive {{services}} {{were intended to}} offer the best possible speed attainable, which could vary over time. The maximum speed permitted was determined by current line conditions, the level of noise, and also by recent history based on factors including the rate of communications errors and {{the best and worst}} DSL modem <b>sync</b> <b>speeds</b> achieved during some recent period of time. The highest speed ADSL Max services enabled customers to receive up to 7.15 Mbit/s (termed 'downstream') over a standard BT telephone line of sufficient quality. Various kinds of lower-speed, rate-limited adaptive {{services were}} also available as a reduced cost option. Customers using ADSL Max with long lines, poor quality lines or who experienced high levels of noise or interference are limited to much slower transfer rates, and some customers whose lines are very poor or who are affected by high levels of noise are unable to obtain service at all.|$|R
5000|$|In 1986, the Olympus OM-4T (Japan) {{introduced}} {{a system that}} could synchronize a specially dedicated accessory Olympus F280 Full Synchro electronic flash to pulse its light at a 20 kilohertz rate for up to 40 ms, to illuminate its horizontal FP shutter's slit as it crossed the entire film gate - in effect, simulating long-burn FP flashbulbs - allowing flash exposure at shutter speeds as fast as 1/2000 s. This allowed daylight plus fill-flash use in almost any situation. However, there is a concomitant loss of flash range.

50|$|The FM/FE chassis {{proved to}} be remarkably long-lived. Nikon used it, with {{incremental}} improvements, as {{the backbone of the}} compact F-series from 1977 to 2006. The other members of the compact F-series are the Nikon FM2 (introduced in 1982), FE2 (1983), FA (1983) and the limited production Nikon FM3A (2001). The FE was discontinued with the introduction of the visually similar FE2, which had faster top and <b>sync</b> shutter <b>speeds,</b> as well as TTL (through-the-lens) flash metering, but which was no longer compatible with non-AI lenses.|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{having a}} {{comparatively}} lower resolution for a DSLR introduced in 2006, the D40 held some benefits over its newer competition {{such as the}} Nikon D40x, D60, and Canon Rebels. Because only 6 megapixels are fit onto the standard Nikon DX format sensor, the sensitivity of each pixel is higher. The default sensitivity on the D40 is ISO 200, and the D40 adds an ISO 3200 speed (listed as [...] "Hi1" [...] in the camera menu) compared to the Nikon D50's maximum ISO 1600. The D40 has a very fast 1/500 flash sync, useful for daytime fill-flash. This compares to the typical 1/200 <b>sync</b> <b>speed</b> of other entry level and even some semi-pro DSLR cameras such as the Canon EOS 40D with its 1/250 <b>sync</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of users who were 500 metres or less from their local telephone exchanges {{were expected to}} achieve connection speeds close to the advertised maximum; with Annex M and interleaving disabled ('fastpath') on a 300-metre loop length, a <b>sync</b> <b>speed</b> of 24 Mbit/s downstream and 2.5 Mbit/s upstream was easily achievable.|$|E
50|$|The Triggertrap v1 is classed as a {{high-speed}} device, {{able to use}} the ambient light sensor to respond and fire the external flash such that it would correctly <b>sync</b> at shutter <b>speeds</b> down to 1/640th of a second- that’s a response time of less than 1.6 milliseconds.|$|R
50|$|Many {{video cameras}} also provide {{the ability to}} adjust their shutter. In most cases the camera {{does not have an}} actual {{mechanical}} shutter. Instead, this adjustment controls {{the amount of time that}} the electronic sensor collects light in order to create each successive image. Because electronic cameras do not need to mechanically advance film, it is possible for the shutter to be open for nearly the entire period of each successive frame. At 24 frames per second, it is possible to expose a frame for nearly 1/24 second, achieving longer motion blur otherwise impossible to achieve on film at <b>sync</b> sound <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Opera 29 was {{released}} on April 28, 2015, based on Chromium 42.

50|$|Nikon {{abandoned}} the earlier mechanically operated shutter of the F2 for a modern, electronically controlled, horizontally traveled metal curtain design. The new shutter {{proved to be}} equally reliable and less maintenance-intensive overall, though the decision to retain the horizontal-travel design significantly limited its top flash <b>sync</b> <b>speed</b> (1/80 sec.) compared to other Nikons, some of which used the Copal shutter. This decision forced many disappointed press photographers to use Nikon's semi pro bodies (FM, FE, FM2, FE2 etc.) instead when higher sync speeds were needed, usually for fill flash in daylight situations. The F4 finally solved this <b>sync</b> <b>speed</b> deficiency with Nikon's pro grade SLR offerings with its 250th sync. In contrast to the manually operated F2, the F3's electronic shutter required battery power to operate, although the camera included a small backup mechanical release lever that tripped the shutter at 1/60 sec.|$|E
50|$|All {{members of}} this series are compact {{autofocus}} SLRs except the MZ-M. The flagship model in this series is the MZ-S which body materials are metal, faster film drive and higher flash <b>sync</b> <b>speed.</b> Only MZ-S and MZ-6 are compatible with newly introduced P-TTL flash system. Both models can control remote flash wirelessly by popup flash commander mode in normal or high-speed flash sync.|$|E
50|$|Circle {{strafing}} {{is especially}} effective when {{employed as a}} form of lag-jumping where the <b>sync</b> <b>speed</b> between the two players affects the defending players' ability to defend themselves. When latency is high, this can lead to the oft-seen phenomenon of two players circling each other, both missing by a considerable margin, until one player unexpectedly collides with an obstacle and is slowed sufficiently for the other to target him.|$|E
50|$|External AV-sync error: If a {{microphone}} is placed {{far away from}} the sound source, the audio will be out of <b>sync</b> because the <b>speed</b> of sound is much lower than the speed of light. If the sound source is 340 meters from the microphone, then the sound arrives approximately 1 second later than the light. The AV-sync delay increases with distance.|$|R
50|$|Fretting wear {{can also}} occur during operation, causing deeper indentations. This occurs when small {{vibrations}} {{form in the}} rotating shaft and become harmonically in <b>sync</b> with the <b>speed</b> of rotation, causing circular oscillations in the shaft. The oscillation causes the shaft to move in precession, and {{the timing of the}} rotation speed causes the balls or rollers to contact the races only when they are in similar positions. This forms wear marks caused by contact with the bearings and the races in specific areas, but not in others, leaving an uneven wear-pattern that resembles brinelling. However, the marks are usually too wide and do not exactly match the shape of the bearing, and therefore this type of wear can be differentiated from true brinelling.|$|R
5000|$|High-end flash units {{address this}} problem by {{offering}} a mode, typically called FP sync or HSS (High <b>Speed</b> <b>Sync),</b> which fires the flash tube multiple times during the time the slit traverses the sensor. Such units require communication with the camera and are thus dedicated to a particular camera make. The multiple flashes result in {{a significant decrease in}} guide number, since each is only a part of the total flash power, but it's all that illuminates any particular part of the sensor. In general, if s is the shutter speed, and t is the shutter traverse time, the guide number reduces by [...] For example, if the guide number is 100, and the shutter traverse time is 5 ms (a shutter speed of 1/200s), and the shutter speed is set to 1/2000 s (0.5 ms), the guide number reduces by a factor of , or about 3.16, so the resultant guide number at this speed would be about 32.|$|R
50|$|Hand-held shots {{required}} use of {{the smaller}} hand-wound spring-work cameras, which were too loud to be practical for any shots requiring synchronized (sync) sound, and held less footage than studio cameras. The spring-wound cameras were also not accurate enough speed-wise to guarantee perfect <b>sync</b> <b>speed,</b> which led to many of them having motors installed (the additional sound being negligible). Thus, these cameras {{could not be used}} for {{much in the way of}} dialogue.|$|E
50|$|The cloth {{focal plane}} shutter has speeds from 1 sec to 1/1000 and B. The {{electronic}} flash <b>sync.</b> <b>speed</b> is 1/60. A delayed action timer gives 8 - 10 seconds delay, using the same front of body lever that actuates the stop-down metering. The mirror can be locked up for vibration reduction or for use with special FL lenses like the original 19mm f3.5 wide angle which projects deeply into the body and would foul the mirror.|$|E
50|$|On March 6, 2007, Nikon {{introduced}} the D40X, a sister camera to the D40. While identical in external design to the D40, {{it has a}} 10.2-megapixel CCD sensor, continuous shooting up to 3 frames per second, and a base sensitivity of ISO 100 (as noted above, each pixel in the 10.2-megapixel sensor receives less light than the pixels in the D40 sensor). It has a flash <b>sync</b> <b>speed</b> of 1/200 seconds compared to the D40's 1/500 seconds. It is otherwise identical.|$|E
40|$|A new {{normalized}} coupling synchronization (NCS) {{method is}} proposed {{to solve the}} problem of synchronizing the speeds of all wheels in a multi‐axis independent driving system without mechanical transmission connection. The NCS method integrates normalizing and coupling techniques by emulating mechanical line shaft. All wheelsʹ speeds are normalized, and thus can be synchronized whether the wheelʹs revolution speeds are the same or different. Then, all of the normalized wheel speeds are coupled in order to eliminate speed synchronization errors between any pair of axes. Therefore, the new algorithm is able to achieve global speed synchronization. It is applicable to multi‐ axis driving vehicles either driving in straight line or making a turn. The conducted computational simulation shows that the proposed method gets better result in reducing speed synchronization errors in both cases of same and different wheel speeds compared to some classic <b>speed</b> <b>sync</b> methods in the literature. To further validate the effectiveness and applicability of the NCS method, it is also applied to a four‐wheel‐driving and four‐wheel‐steering vehicle for comparison tests. The onboard tests indicate that the proposed method achieves a fast convergence of speed error...|$|R
5000|$|The R9 was an {{evolutionary}} step from the R8 and appears superficially very similar; {{enough so that}} some have opined {{that it should have}} been simply a Mark II of the R8, or in Leica nomenclature, an [...] "R8.2".2 The silver top-plate color available on the R8 was replaced by an 'Anthracite' color on the R9; black remained available. Another external change was the addition of an LCD frame counter on the top plate between the wind lever and the shutter-speed dial. The mode selector dial gained a lock, after many R8 user complaints that it was too easily moved from the desired setting when handling the camera. The rear LCD display gained a backlight so it could be viewed in dim lighting. The mass of the R9 was reduced by 100g (to 790g) from the R8, achieved by switching to a magnesium casting for the top plate (formerly zinc alloy) and substituting aluminum for steel at the bottom plate's frame. Electronic changes included the ability to tune the sensitivity of matrix metering in steps of 0.1 EV independently of the other metering modes, and several improvements to the flash support. Metz's HSS (High <b>Speed</b> <b>Sync)</b> flash mode was now supported, allowing fill flash at shutter speeds greater than the X-sync speed by the use of many repeated small flashes of the electronic flashgun. This mode could be used from 1/360 to the camera's shortest 1/8000 of a second shutter speed. Also improved was the use of fill-flash at slower shutter speeds and wider apertures, by enabling lower-power illumination modes on modern Metz equipment. The manual flash exposure compensation ability in Program mode was improved, and AE lock was now possible in all automated modes.|$|R
5000|$|Two leaf-shuttered lenses {{were also}} made available, first the 90mm 2.8 {{and later a}} 165mm 2.8 that both {{allowing}} flash <b>sync</b> at all <b>speeds,</b> thereby solving many mirror and shutter vibration problems as well as allowing for fast shutter speeds for use with strobes and portable flashes while in bright shooting conditions. Lenses {{are linked to the}} body by the operation of the aperture stop-down lever being tripped. The camera body is set to the [...] "time-exposure" [...] setting. The through-the-lens (TTL) metering pentaprism viewfinder and included a knurled shutter dial ring with fitted case. The TTL-metered Pentaprism is the same coverage as the non-metered pentaprism, a coverage of 90% of frame and has a sensitivity pattern of 60% center-weight and 30% inner field sensitivity. The TTL Metering Pentaprism has no internal power of its own, instead, the operating power comes from one of the three contacts found in the finder bay of the body as well as grounding to the body. Only two of the three contacts are utilized and depending on the two modes: Normal as 'AUTO' mode and in an override to stopdown mode in the 'MAN' mode as found on many equipped lenses. In 'AUTO' is where the lens is fully opened and adjustments are read from the coupled index from the lens-through the index ring of the body mount-to the chain and index shuttle, the TTL-Meter receives the position information via a protruding tab facing the finder bay. The tab operates a linear potentiometer. In 'MAN' or manual mode with so equipped lenses, the sliding of the lens switch will move an internal lever that then presses down on the activating switch in the body. The switch is located inside the pin of the lens release pin. This inner pin is connected to an electrical toggle inside the body and switches the current from body grounded to bay connector to activate the secondary circuit. The installation of the TTL-Meter into the finder bay requires first the removal or turning of the lens to remove tension on the aperture chain. When the lens is rotated to allow the index on the chain to properly match up with the tab under the meter, the finder can then be seated and firmly pressed until the locks {{on either side of the}} finder latch. Removal of the finder is the reverse by first removing the lens and then pressing in the locks on the sides of the finder and lifting out. The physical difference of the TTL-Meter to the regular prism is the bulky arm that extends to the shutter speed dial. The dial covers the body dial and is coupled via a spring loaded index to the shutter speed dial. The included knurled ring assists the reach of the shutter speed dial due to the bulk of the TTL-Meter prism. The stop-down mode or direct metering through while the aperture is allowed to operate and change the amount of light, is similar to the 'MAN' mode, but activates when a non-auto-aperture lens is mounted causing index ring to be positioned to place the meter's linear potenioment into a bypass mode to activate the secondary circuit in the meter. The lens is allowed to stop-down and the light is directly measured, however, the shutter speed dial link operates the same in 'MAN' mode. As did the body receiving improvements over time, so did the TTL-Meter have had some changes. Although the image coverage remained unchanged, the type of metering and the circuitry received some upgrades. CdS (cadmium sulfide) to Gpd (gallium photo diode) photo cells and a two part circuit to a single board to improve response time and reliability. The early version is identified by the single marked 'ON' switch and the meter needle starts from UP to down and the later model has a 'ON' & 'OFF' marked switch and the meter needle starts from BOTTOM to top. The later model would also have the sole PENTAX badge by 1986.|$|R

50|$|The Minolta 7000 was {{the first}} {{successful}} auto focus SLR using a motor integrated in the camera body.It was released in 1985 together with 11 lenses, 2 flashguns and a complete lineup of accessories.The 7000 featured one AF-sensor, shutter speeds of 1/2000 to 30 seconds, flash <b>sync</b> <b>speed</b> of 1/100s, exposure compensation of +/-4EV in 0.5 exposure steps, center-weighted lightmetering and two frames per second film advance. The Maxxum 7000, when first released had the crossed x's in the name Maxxum. Exxon had a registered trademark for the crossed x's and sued Minolta, forcing Minolta {{to change the way}} the name was shown.|$|E
50|$|The shutter {{is rated}} to 200,000 shots, and {{is capable of}} speeds up to 1/8000 s, with a flash <b>sync</b> <b>speed</b> of 1/250 s. Using {{compatible}} external flashes, flash sync speeds up to 1/8000 s are possible. Additionally, the camera can be set to automatically delay its shutter release to compensate for flickering electric lights. The camera's reflex mirror is driven by a motor which slows the mirror to reduce vibration during high speed shooting. This motor also enables unique new Silent Shooting Modes, which reduce camera noise, {{at the cost of}} a slight increase of shutter lag time from 0.055 s to 0.105 s.|$|E
50|$|The Minolta 7000 had its AF {{sensors and}} the {{focusing}} drive inside the camera body, {{and as a}} result the lenses could be much smaller and cheaper. The aperture and focus were mechanically driven through the lens mount from the camera body. However, electronically controlled buttons on the camera body now replaced the mechanical aperture ring on the lens, and the setting was electronically displayed on the body and in the viewfinder. The metal housing of older Minolta SLR cameras was replaced with a lighter, cheaper body made of plastics. In other respects, the Maxxum offered most of the standard features of other cameras of the day, {{with the exception of a}} rather low flash <b>sync</b> <b>speed</b> (1/125 sec.) and no multi-exposure capability.|$|E
5000|$|A verbal {{identification}} of the numbers, known either as [...] "voice slate" [...] or [...] "announcement", occurs after sound has reached speed.

[...] Occasionally, instead of preparing an actual slate, a voice slate will be announced (often by an actor in the scene) and then the actor will clap their hands together, to provide the sync mark.|$|E
5000|$|The Minolta 9000, {{a camera}} aimed at professionals, was {{released}} later the same year, and featured shutter speeds of 1/4000 to 30 seconds, center-weighted and spot lightmetering, exposure compensation of +-4EV in 0.5 exposure steps and a flash <b>sync</b> <b>speed</b> of 1/250s. Unlike the 7000, the 9000 had no internal motordrive and thus holds the {{position as the}} world's only autofocusing SLR with manual winding, but {{with the addition of}} the motor drive MD-90 a photographer could get up to 5 frames per second. The 9000 had a very extensive range of accessories, including several different backs, winding options and screens. The 9000 had a unique function in that, if combined with the Minolta Data Receiver DR-1000 and the Minolta Flash Meter IV, readings could be made on the flash meter and transferred wirelessly to the camera, and the camera then triggered from the flash meter.|$|E
