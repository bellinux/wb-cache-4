40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to solve the problem of the fast release of the water soluble drug linked to polysaccharides ion-exchange {{microspheres}}, which display a high degree of swelling. Dextran ion-exchange microspheres (Dm = 80 Î¼m) loaded with two different water soluble drugs (Tetracycline HCl, Propranolol HCl), were included in cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) microcapsules. <b>Spherical</b> <b>CAB</b> microcapsules were obtained by oil in water (o/w) solvent evaporation method in the presence of an inert solvent as cyclohexane (CyH) or n-hexane (N-Hex), and different excipients (Phospholipon, Tween, Span, Eudragit RS 100). Chloroform was found to be the best solvent for the preparation of the microcapsules. Also, the sphericity as well as the porosity of the microcapsules was controlled by the presence of an inert solvent. The final concentration of the drug in CAB microparticles was up to 25...|$|E
