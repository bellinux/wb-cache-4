40|$|This {{technical}} report {{is aimed at}} providing a sound base to the revision process of the EU Ecolabel criteria for <b>Soil</b> <b>improvers</b> and Growing Media. Currently, separate sets of EU Ecolabel criteria exist for <b>Soil</b> <b>improvers</b> (Decision 2006 / 799 /EC) and Growing media (Decision 2007 / 64 /EC). The revision process spanned both product groups; thus common criteria for both <b>Soil</b> <b>improvers</b> and Growing media are developed, only distinguishing between technical product characteristics where necessary. Another objective of this revision is addressing the possibility to broaden the current scope to the product mulch, {{as it has been}} identified as a differentiated sub-product within the product group 'soil improvers'. To achieve those objectives, a Preliminary Report was produced together with the first version of this {{technical report}} as a working document. Hence, this document was developed to undergo the stakeholder consultation, which is crucial to come up with criteria adapted to the market reality while being able to select the best environmental performance products available on the market. After an extensive stakeholder's consultation process, this current version of the Technical Report supporting the draft criteria for growing media, <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> and mulch, constitutes the support of the criteria set voted positive by the Regulatory Committee.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} with the main objective of assessing the suitability of Tanzanian vermiculites as <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> for crop production through characterization. The research involved five samples from Tanzania and one from South Africa, which was included for comparison purposes. The results show that not all samples are vermiculites, some are hydrobiotites. Analysis shows {{that none of them}} contain hazardous accessory minerals. The samples have high cation exchange capacities (CEC) and, thus, they are suitable as <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> with ability to retain plant nutrients form leaching. Some have elevated concentrations of Cr and Ni, but the metals are insignificantly plant-available and do not inhibit the uptake of essential plant nutrients. Heating vermiculites above 600 °C should be avoided as it reduces the CEC by more than 90 %, and makes some of the exfoliated products strongly alkaline and, thus, unfavourable for crop production. The Tanzanian vermiculites can retain plant-available water, but their ability is less than vermiculite from South Africa. The P in the vermiculites is extractable and extractability increases on heating to 200 - 400 °C. Application of vermiculites to the soil significantly enhanced the retention and fertilization of P. Nitrogen and K were less retained. Maize vegetative growth, dry matter yield, and nutrient uptake were significantly enhanced by amending the soil with vermiculites. Pre-heated vermiculite at 600 °C performed better than unheated vermiculite and inhibited the fixation of the applied K and N. Thus, the Tanzanian vermiculites are suitable for use as <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> for crop production. However, more field trials are recommended on other types of soils and crops other than sand and maize used in this research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The main methods used for the detection and enumeration of Clostridium and Enterococcus spp. have been developed largely for analysis of food and water and can be broadly divided into three groups. Quantification of colonies on agar media; most probable number (MPN) quantification in indicator broth using conventional test tube technology; and proprietary Quantitray® technology equivalent to the 5 -tube MPN technique employing disposable plastic trays for enumeration of enterococci. The merits of each are described. At least one report has suggested that the use of m-CP agar medium, which is used in the reference method in the European Union, is not suitable for recovering C. perfringens spores from groundwater. This questions its possible use as a method for detecting C. perfringens in sludge, <b>soil,</b> <b>soil</b> <b>improvers,</b> growing media, and biowaste.

In order to promote the utilization of such digestate products effectively, we need more information on their quality, safety, and applicability in crop production. We have used plant bioassays to evaluate the quality and potential phytotoxicity of various digestate products obtained from three full-scale biogas plants processing organic waste and by-products from agriculture, industry and municipalities in Finland.

50|$|The first {{occurrence}} of organised {{solid waste management}} system appeared in London in the late 18th century. A waste collection and resource recovery system was established around the 'dust-yards'. Main constituent of municipal waste was the coal ash (‘dust’) which had a market value for brick-making and as a <b>soil</b> <b>improver.</b> Such profitability encouraged dust-contractors to recover effectively 100% of the residual wastes remaining after readily saleable items and materials had been removed by the informal sector in the streets ('rag-and-bone men'). Therefore, this was an early example of organised, municipal-wide solid waste management. The dust-yard system had been working successfully up to middle 1850s, when {{the market value of}} ‘dust’ collapsed. It was important in facilitating a relatively smooth transition to an institutionalised, municipally-run solid waste management system in England.|$|E

Carbon dioxide, waste air and small quantities of other gases including hydrogen sulfide are given off. These waste gases require treatment to reduce odours in works close to housing or capable of generating public nuisance. The digestion is continued until the percentage of degradable solids is reduced to between 20% and 10% depending on local conditions Where non sewage waste is being processed, organic waste such as food, cardboard and horticultural waste and be significantly reduced in volume leaving an output that can be used as <b>soil</b> <b>improver</b> or biomass fuel.|$|E

The problem of measuring air flow rates through home compost bins was tackled by making comparisons with simultaneously run, forced-aeration sealed compost reactors at known air flow rates. Analysis of headspace gases for VOCs, CH 4, NH 3 and N 2 O are reported with concentrations of NH 3 up to 15 ppm and no CH 4 or N 2 O above atmospheric concentrations under tested conditions despite headspace CO 2 concentrations as high as 15 %. Headspace CO 2 concentration and compost temperature profiles are reported for a range of composting scenarios and the mass balance methodology is demonstrated. The benefits of home produced composts as <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> are measured in terms of water extractable nutrients and potentially toxic elements, with findings confirming previous work indicating they are safe and beneficial.
