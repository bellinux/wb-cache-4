Since Rosecroft had expanded its <b>simulcasting</b> rights, the new grandstand incorporated large-screen televisions and betting windows.

The handle was decreasing, and the officials could not afford the purses for the races. To help increase the handle, Maryland racetrack officials voted to allow inter-track <b>simulcasting</b> between all Maryland tracks and authorized off-track betting parlors throughout the state.|$|E
