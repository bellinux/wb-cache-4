5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{couplers}} {{like the}} Janney are <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> a collision because they help prevent the carriages telescoping. British Rail therefore decided {{to adopt a}} Janney variant for its passenger carriages, with the coupler able to swing {{out of the way}} for coupling to engines with the traditional buffer and chain system.|$|E
25|$|The term bikeway {{is largely}} used in North America to {{describe}} all routes {{that have been}} designed or updated to encourage more cycling or make cycling <b>safer.</b> <b>In</b> some jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, segregated cycling facility is sometimes preferred to describe cycling infrastructure which has varying degrees of separation from motorized traffic, or which has excluded pedestrian traffic {{in the case of}} exclusive bike paths.|$|E

25|$|Worldwide, {{road traffic}} is {{becoming}} ever <b>safer,</b> <b>in</b> {{part due to}} efforts {{by the government to}} implement safety features in cars (e.g., seat belts, air bags, etc.), reduce unsafe driving practices (e.g., speeding, drinking and driving and texting and driving) and make road design more safe by adding features such as speed bumps, which reduce vehicle speed, and roundabouts, which reduce the likelihood of a head-on-collision (as compared with an intersection).|$|E
25|$|A city {{car is a}} small {{automobile}} {{intended for}} use in urban areas. Unlike microcars, a city car's greater speed, capacity and (in perception at least) occupant protection are <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> mixed traffic environments and weather conditions. While city cars can reach highway speeds, that is not their intended use. In Japan, city cars are called kei cars. Kei cars have to meet strict size and engine requirements: engines have a maximum displacement of 660nbsp&cc and the car's length must be under 3400nbsp&mm.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of {{regulation}} {{were able to}} show statements from women in prostitution that they felt <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> brothels than on the streets, health checks let them gain business by showing clients they had {{a clean bill of}} health, and government regulation removed the stigma of their occupation. Abolitionists said these were exceptional cases. Interviews by IAF and Women's Christian Temperance Union reformers in India in the late 19th century showed that women in prostitution serving the troops detested the compulsory medical checks.|$|E

25|$|The {{symptoms}} {{and the treatment}} of an overdose are largely {{the same as for}} the other TCAs, including the presentation of serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. The British National Formulary notes that amitriptyline can be particularly dangerous in overdose, thus it and other TCAs are no longer recommended as first-line therapy for depression. Alternative agents, SSRIs and SNRIs, are <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> overdose, though they are no more efficacious than TCAs. English folk singer Nick Drake died from an overdose of Tryptizol in 1974.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} {{caesarean section}} involves a midline incision on the uterus longitudinal incision which allows a larger space {{to deliver the}} baby. It is performed at very early gestations where the lower segment of the uterus is unformed as it is <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> this situation for the baby: but it is rarely performed other than at these early gestations, as the operation is more prone to complications than a low transverse uterine incision. Any woman {{who has had a}} classical section will be recommended to have an elective repeat section in subsequent pregnancies as the vertical incision is much more likely to rupture in labour than the transverse incision.|$|E
25|$|Buspirone, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Buspar, is an {{anxiolytic}} drug that is primarily used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is also commonly used to augment antidepressants {{in the treatment of}} major depressive disorder. Unlike most anxiolytics, the pharmacology of buspirone is not related to that of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or carbamates (it is not a GABA receptor agonist), and so buspirone does not carry the risk of physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms for which those drug classes are known. Buspirone is not considered to be a drug-of-abuse, is <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> overdose than traditional anxiolytics, and is significantly less impairing at therapeutic doses.|$|E

25|$|Benzodiazepines are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used medication for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and are generally safe and effective in suppressing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. This class of medications is generally effective in symptoms control, but need to be used carefully. Although benzodiazepines {{have a long history of}} successfully treating and preventing withdrawal, there is no consensus on the ideal one to use. The most commonly used agents are long-acting benzodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam. These are believed to be superior to other benzodiazepines for treatment of delirium and allow for longer periods between dosing. However, benzodiazepines with intermediate half-lives like lorazepam may be <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> people with liver problems.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Vaksince, Matejce {{and other}} villages on the battleground, Lipkovo still had 10,000 {{people who were}} not {{evacuated}} by the government or the Red Cross. In order to prevent civilian casualties, government representatives ordered the civilians in Lipkovo to evacuate the village. However, this order was not followed since the NLA insurgents in the village would not allow the International Red Cross to evacuate the civilians. The Mayor of Lipkovo, Husamedin Halili, issued an order opposite to the government's. He told civilians that they would be <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> the basements of their houses rather than attempt to leave the village because they would find themselves in the cross-fire between the security forces and the NLA.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 18 {{passengers}} survived the collision. Passengers {{who were able}} to see downstream became aware of the rapidly closing motions of the vessels, and rightly concluded that the collision was imminent. Fourteen of the survivors were thrown clear and surfaced without difficulty. Three others were briefly trapped under the George Prince. The last survivor had run back to his vehicle, thinking he would be <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> his truck. After the collision, he managed to escape his sinking vehicle through a window. Only one survivor had a life jacket before going into the water, but had not had time to put it on. Two others found life jackets floating in the river, which they used for a short time, but neither man had time to properly don the life jackets.|$|E

25|$|The Airbus Helicopters H160 takes {{advantage}} of several advanced manufacturing technologies and materials {{in order to produce}} a lighter, more efficient design. One weight-saving measure was the replacement of conventional hydraulic landing gear and brakes with electrical counterparts, the first helicopter in the world to do so; according to Airbus the elimination of hydraulic components makes the rotorcraft both lighter and <b>safer.</b> <b>In</b> 2015, Airbus claimed that the all-composite H160 would deliver the same basic performance as the rival AgustaWestland AW139 while being a ton lighter, having a lower fuel consumption and offering 15–20% lower direct operating costs. The composite fuselage also provided for greater design freedom of the rotorcraft's external styling. During the aircraft's development, features such as full de-icing equipment and a fly-by-wire control system, were deemed too heavy or costly for the benefits involved and were eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Rural areas lacked {{access to}} safe water {{supplies}} {{in the event}} of an epidemic of waterborne diseases. Water came primarily from large earthen tanks, rivers and tube wells. In the dry season, partially drained tanks became yet another hospitable breeding area for malaria vector mosquitoes. Tank and river water, moreover, are readily susceptible to contamination by cholera; tube wells are much <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> this respect. However, landlords were often reluctant to sink tube wells for economic reasons, even when credit was extended for this purpose, and as many as one-third of the existing wells in war-time Bengal were in disrepair due to government inefficiency and the high cost of materials. The national government urged an initiative to repair these wells in November 1943, but actual work was not begun until after the cholera epidemic had subsided.|$|E
25|$|The guecha warriors enjoyed special {{privileges}} and were considered a higher {{class of the}} society. They ranked below the priests, but above the general people. Both Pedro Simón and Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita describe the guecha warriors as strong and brave men, recruited from {{the people in the}} various villages of the Muisca Confederation. They went through years of training in combat before being assigned as guecha warrior. Their appearance was different from the other people, of which the men had long hair. To be more efficient and <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> battle, the guecha warriors cut their hair short. While jewellery was not common among the general people, and after installation of the Code of Nemequene even prohibited, the guecha warriors wore jewels such as golden or tumbaga nose pieces, pectorals, earrings and crowns with coloured feathers. The amount of earrings would indicate the number of enemies beaten. Their bodies were painted using inks from the Genipa americana tree.|$|E

25|$|Calvin's {{concept of}} God and man {{contained}} strong elements of freedom that were gradually {{put into practice}} after his death, in particular {{in the fields of}} politics and society. After the successful fight for independence from Spain (1579), the Netherlands, under Calvinist leadership, became the freest country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, e.g. French Huguenots, English Independents (Congregationalists), and Jews from Spain and Portugal. The ancestors of philosopher Baruch Spinoza were Portuguese Jews. Aware of the trial against Galileo, René Descartes lived in the Netherlands, out of reach of the Inquisition. Pierre Bayle, a Reformed Frenchman, also felt <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands than in his home country. He was the first prominent philosopher who demanded tolerance for atheists. Hugo Grotius was able to publish a rather liberal interpretation of the Bible and his ideas about natural law. Moreover, the Calvinist Dutch authorities allowed the printing of books that could not be published elsewhere, e.g. Galileo's Discorsi.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} {{it was thought that}} only Smith had seen the manuscript. However, in 2003, Guy Stroumsa {{reported}} that he and a group of other scholars had seen it in 1976. During a visit to Mar Saba, Stroumsa, along with the late Hebrew University professors David Flusser and Shlomo Pines, Greek Orthodox Archimandrite Meliton, and a Mar Saba monk, relocated the document where Smith had left it. Stroumsa, Meliton, and company determined that the manuscript might be <b>safer</b> <b>in</b> Jerusalem than in Mar Saba. They took it back with them, and Meliton subsequently brought it to the Patriarchate library. The group looked into having the ink tested but the only entity in the area with such technology was the Jerusalem police. Meliton did not want to leave the manuscript with the police, so no test was taken. Stroumsa published his account upon learning that he was the last living Western academic to have seen the letter.|$|E
25|$|Brereton ordered MARKET to {{be flown}} in daylight. The conference {{allocated}} directives {{to the three}} airborne divisions, giving the southernmost objectives to the 101st Airborne Division so that the flight paths of aircraft bringing it from its bases in southern England would not cross those bring the 82nd Airborne Division from the Grantham area. Another fateful decision taken at the conference was to only have C-47s tow a single glider. Double-towing gliders was difficult and dangerous, but single-towing meant stretching the glider lift out over four days. The next day, Williams held a conference with his wing and group commanders. Two routes were considered, a northern one that ran across the occupied Netherlands, and a southern route that approached through Belgium. The northern route was shorter and simpler but the southern was <b>safer.</b> <b>In</b> the end Williams decided to use both, with the British 1st Airborne Division and the 82nd Airborne Division taking the northern route and the 101st Airborne Division using the southern one. Once again, the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing would work with the 82nd Airborne Division while the 53rd Troop Carrier Wing worked withb the 101st Airborne Division.|$|E
