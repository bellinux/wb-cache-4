40|$|How does {{information}} technology affect wages and organization? To answer this question, we model an economy formed by {{a continuum of}} agents with heterogeneous cognitive skill, who use a production technology that requires physical inputs and knowledge. Our model generates an assignment of workers to positions, a wage structure, and a universe of knowledge-based hierarchies with different allocations <b>of</b> tasks, <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and number <b>of</b> layers. It displays positive sorting between production workers and problem solvers, an increasing relationship between rank and cognitive ability, an increasing and convex wage schedule and a positive relation between wages and firm size. We use our model to study the impact of {{information technology}} on the labor market and {{on the structure of}} firms. We show that the evolution of wage inequality and firm size is consistent with decreases in the cost of accessing information in the 80 ’s and early 90 ’s and decrease in the cost of communicating information in the late 90 ’s. Our theory is also consistent with the evidence on decentralization, flatter hierarchies and larger <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Decentralized decision-making, Malone says, {{tends to}} create less {{rigidity}} and flatter hierarchies in organizations.

30|$|Overall, {{the results}} within our stylized {{framework}} confirm that self-reinforcing mechanisms {{proved to be}} more dominant than the hierarchical features in organizations and that neither variation of hierarchical structures (different <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> <b>control)</b> nor strong leadership (high leadership impact), as modeled here, prevents an organization from experiencing path dependence and the risk of a lock-in. In the following, we present refined results regarding the process itself. In addition, we present a detailed analysis of the way organizational hierarchy affects the unfolding of path-dependent processes.|$|R
2500|$|The Army placed {{importance}} on the GCV's {{ability to carry}} a full nine-man squad.

[...] The Bradley's lower carrying capacity was accepted for greater (than previous vehicles) mounted lethality and cost savings, leading to squads being broken apart for transport. [...] A GCV with a nine-man squad would have allowed the squad leader to control and communicate with the squad while mounted, simplify the transition to dismounted operations in complex terrain, and allow the squad to conduct independent fire and maneuver immediately upon dismount. [...] Replacing the Bradley on a one-for-one basis would have four GCVs per mechanized infantry platoon carrying one full nine-man squad in a single vehicle, with three vehicles carrying squads and one carrying the platoon's organic and attached enablers.|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} {{calls in the}} P/OM {{literature}} for research aimed at {{a better understanding of}} manufacturing policy and requests in the OB literature for further clarification of the nature and effects of "contingency" variables. A field study was done in an effort to address both of these concerns. The study involved 20 manufacturing firms of 1, 000 or more employees in four different industries. A theoretical model was developed which suggests a link between the degree of stability in the external environment and various aspects of structure and policy in manufacturing departments. The hypotheses tested predicted that policy would differ for firms facing different environments and that if policy and environmental conditions were appropriately matched, better departmental performance would result. Results indicate that the degree of environmental stability may relate negatively to the level of administrative intensity, the degree of preference for small versus large plants, and the degree of preference for low versus high inventories. These findings were in accord with the theory of the model. No support was indicated for predictions that the degree of environmental stability would correlate negatively with <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and with preferences for general-purpose equipment or for the expected positive relationship between stability and number of organizational levels or preferences for process structures. There was also no support found for the hypothesis that better "fit" of environment with policy/structure leads to better performance. There was some evidence that type <b>of</b> technology affects <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> number <b>of</b> levels, type of equipment preferred, and levels of inventories preferred, but no support for the importance of size (of firm) as an influence on policy and structure.

40|$|Abstract__ This paper studies how a three-layer {{hierarchical}} firm (principal-supervisor-agent) optimally creates effort {{norms for}} its employees. The key {{assumption is that}} effort norms {{are affected by the}} example of superiors. In equilibrium, norms are eroded as one moves down the hierarchy. The reason is that, because exerting effort is costly, the supervisor only partially complies with the principal's example, and thereby transmits a lower norm to the agent. The principal optimally responds to norm erosion by setting a higher example to begin with. In equilibrium, norm erosion gives rise to three inefficiencies: the principal works too hard, the supervisor's norm is too high, and the agent's norm is too low. To reduce these inefficiencies, firms should keep the extent of hierarchy to a minimum, promote employees with the strongest sensitivity to social norms, and distort man agerial <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

The belief that ‘flatter is better’ appears to have become a truism in many academic and managerial circles.

Findings suggest that narrow control spans support core practices of lean production, such as just-in-time, multi-skilling and, particularly, continuous improvement. Managers who implement lean production are discouraged from simultaneously pursuing de-layering of the supervisory hierarchy. Alternatively, they need to develop functional equivalents to fulfil ‘supervisory’ functions. `status: publishe...|$|R
