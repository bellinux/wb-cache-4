They have a monopoly on this work and the cheerful gangs of girls are a picturesque element in the city's life. They need to be immensely strong to do a job which consists of carrying over a short distance anything up to an entire yak's load several times a day. Many of them are quite pretty (and well aware of the fact); they look very gay and rather brazen as, giggling and chattering among themselves, they move along with their heavy burdens, which are held in place by a woolen girdle around the chest.|$|E
500|$|Coxon {{struggled}} with drinking problems and, in {{a rejection of}} the group's former Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. In the 2010 documentary on the band, No Distance Left to Run, Coxon stated that he was getting more influenced by American guitarists as [...] "a lot of them were doing very interesting stuff with guitars and I needed to be nourished. I suppose as a guitar player and there was none of that happening in English music although English music was now more popular [...] I started listening to more <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> States from smaller labels." ...|$|E

500|$|The Helvellyn range runs broadly north-south {{for about}} 11 {{kilometres}} (7 miles), remaining above 600m (1,970ft) throughout its length. Nethermost Pike is toward {{the southern end}} of this ridge, with Helvellyn itself to the north and Dollywaggon Pike to the south. In common with much of the Helvellyn range there is a marked contrast between the western and eastern slopes of Nethermost Pike. In Wainwright's words: [...] "The grassy western slope trodden by the multitudes is of little interest, but the fell should not be judged accordingly: it is made of sterner <b>stuff.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> east, Nethermost Pike is magnificent, hardly less so than Helvellyn." ...|$|E
500|$|Join Hands {{was written}} {{over a period}} of six months. In 1979, the band watched news reports from Iran, {{including}} scenes of repression and curfews; {{it was one of the}} first times they had seen images of people being shot and killed on television. In England, the political situation was also unstable, with rubbish piling up in the streets of London. Siouxsie Sioux saw it as [...] "a real time, everything in flocks and uncertain but also festering underneath, and because this <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> past that was just left there rotting there and it needed to be acknowledged and then cleaned up, not just swept away still rotting". The band were inspired by these events. The theme of war emerged through the songs: rather than a pro-military message, the lyrics were meant to capture the spirit of what things were like at the time. Miranda Sawyer stated that Join Hands took [...] "the very un-rock'n'roll topic of World War I as its inspiration".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} she remembered her first day of filming, Woodburne {{recalled}} [...] "Yes - I remember it perfectly. We were unpacking <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> car and moving into No 28. I already knew Alan, but I didn't know the kids. It all just meshed, though, and we knew immediately what type of family {{we were going to}} be." [...] Susan was given a teaching job at the local high school and Karl became the local GP, giving the family immediate links with other characters. In 1995, Rainey Mayo portrayed a teenage Susan in a daydream. In October 2009, Woodburne became the longest-serving actress in the show's history, having appeared on-screen as Susan for fifteen years. Of her television milestone, Woodburne said, [...] "It seems both bizarre and wonderful to me that I'm coming up to 15 years on the show, even though the world of Neighbours feels instinctive and familiar, I'm still challenged and rewarded by the work." ...|$|E

500|$|Time Out {{gave the}} film a mostly {{positive}} review, writing, [...] "While Django remains the erratic Corbucci's best picture, this slightly later spaghetti Western does well by an inventive set-up [...] between the bullets there's engaging <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two stars and an unmistakable {{chill in the}} air". Film critic Leonard Maltin praised the film, awarding it 3 1/2 {{out of a possible}} 4 stars. In his review he wrote that The Great Silence is a [...] "brutal, bleakly beautiful spaghetti Western filmed on stark locations in the Dolomites, {{with one of the most}} uncompromising and unforgettable finales ever filmed". Kyle Anderson of Nerdist News described the film as Corbucci's [...] "most artful and daring" [...] Western, one that [...] "pushes the genre to new levels and creates a story unlike anything people were used to, even though it's likely more historically accurate". He concluded his review by stating that [...] "If you're looking for a good time on a Saturday night, I'd say this movie is not what you want, but if you're looking for a dark, violent, thoughtful, and well-made film, look no further".|$|E
500|$|When {{her father}} was jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud, she left home with her sister {{to live with her}} mother and partner (Crossroads actor Charles Stapley), in Clapham, London. Her brother went to Brighton to live with his {{paternal}} grandparents. She later wrote that at the age of 15 she ran away to join a funfair, and lived in a cardboard box under Waterloo station for four months, although Stapley denied this by saying that she occasionally left home at weekends to travel with a young man who worked for a funfair in London. During her stated period of homelessness, her school records indicate that she and her sister were both enrolled at Usworth comprehensive in Tyne and Wear until April 1983, and at Hydeburn Comprehensive, in Balham, on 6 June 1983, where they both stayed until 2 July 1984. She remembered that a teacher at the Hydeburn once said, [...] "there's no hope for her at all", and that she left school with no academic qualifications. In the same year, her father had another daughter, Claire Mills, with a new partner. Mills worked for a croissant shop, but was sacked, and vowed [...] "never to work for anyone else again". She later wrote in her autobiography that the owner of a jewellery shop in Clapham gave her a job on Saturdays, but Jim Guy, the owner of Penrose Jewellers, later stated: [...] "Everything she wrote about me was lies, I never gave her a job; she just hung around and made tea. She told me {{her father was}} dead. The only thing that was true was she nicked <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shop", which Guy said was worth £20,000. She admitted that she had stolen some gold chains and sold them to buy a moped, and when Guy reported the theft, she was put on probation.|$|E
500|$|Closing out the year, My Name Is My Name {{was named}} to {{multiple}} [...] "Best Albums of the Year" [...] lists. It was ranked at number 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "The cockier half of the Clipse didn't choose to go solo — he had to after his brother found God. Pusha, in turn, found Kanye West, whose stark and twisted production helped make My Name Is My Name feel like a more lyrically focused companion piece to his own Yeezus. It's the year's sharpest hit of street philosophy." [...] Complex named it the third best album of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "everything clicks {{because of the way}} it was calculated. The songs benefit from their respective placement beside each other, each track a background for the next. In that way, it brings the Pusha T fan up to speed with what he's evolved into, without leaving them in unfamiliar territory. If you were the reluctant [...] "we want that old Pusha T" [...] fan, then it fed you the teaspoon of updated classic with the medicine of his reinvention—and by the end, you appreciated both sides." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly named it the eighth best album of 2013 saying, [...] "With these beats — private-stash <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> likes of his label boss Kanye West and Pharrell Williams — he could sell fire in hell. In fact, Pusha plumbs his emotional depths, breaking down his parents' divorce after 35 years of marriage and his conflicted feelings about his brother." [...] Exclaim! named it the second best hip hop album of 2013. XXL named it the fourth best album of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "Song for song, it's tough to put any album in the same category as Pusha's proper solo debut. In the space of a trim 46 minutes, Push coaxed the best verse of Rick Ross' year on [...] "Hold On," [...] made Kendrick Lamar get dark and grim on [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and even rapped over a beat that seemed impossible to make into a hip-hop track on [...] "King Push," [...] all while keeping his lyricism at the absolute highest level. The worst song on this album could find its way onto a top ten list. If this is what a post-Yeezus world sounds like, sign us up immediately." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The Ballad of Mona Lisa" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} by Alternative Press as [...] " [...] the upbeat pop energy of A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, with the focus and clarity of Pretty. Odd." [...] Urie has explained that he and Smith desired to achieve a sound that is more similar to the former: [...] "We missed a couple things from our first record in terms of sonically, with these little instruments that we hadn’t really used on our second record. There [...] a lot of organic instruments and not a lot of electronics or synthesizers. So we wanted to get back to some of that." [...] Smith agreed, and stated [...] "I think there's <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first album that we kind of got away from on the second record that people who were fans of the first one will enjoy." [...] "The Calendar", originally written about an intimate relationship between a male and a female, soon began to resemble the friendships in former members Ross and Walker; the song was finished as a direct response to their departure from the group. [...] "Sarah Smiles" [...] was written for Urie's wife. [...] "'Sarah Smiles' is about my girlfriend, actually, as sappy as that is," [...] he told Spin in 2011. [...] "When I met her I wrote this song to try and impress her. I was infatuated with her. I played it for her and we've been dating ever since. That was a huge step for me, personally." [...] "Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)" [...] was rejected for inclusion on Pretty. Odd. due it not fitting within the concept of the album; Urie and Smith finished the song for Vices & Virtues.|$|E
