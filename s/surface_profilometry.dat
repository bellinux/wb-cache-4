40|$|Non-contact <b>surface</b> <b>profilometry</b> techniques, {{especially}} the phase-measuring profilometry, have been evolved dramatically over recent years. Besides the simple triangulation configuration with a fringe pattern projection system and digital imaging system, efficient computational <b>surface</b> <b>profilometry</b> techniques have also drawn tremendous attention from both academia {{and a wide}} range of applications. In the semiconductor industry, high-precision and high-speed, automated optical inspection systems are urgently needed to ensure high quality of semiconductor devices and yield improvement on the production and assembly line. However, by assuming the measured object to be stationary, conventional approaches are not suitable for <b>surface</b> <b>profilometry</b> of moving objects. Moreover, different sources of error such as the low contrast fringe patterns on the measured object, the unevenness in the illumination and the perspective projection effect from the optics will decrease the performance of <b>surface</b> <b>profilometry.</b> To meet these challenges, we have built fringe pattern projection prototypes with projector and camera arrays for <b>surface</b> <b>profilometry</b> of moving objects along the conveyor belt. This design helps to enlarge the field of view with parallel processing. In addition, we have presented an optimization framework to investigate the sources of the error for <b>surface</b> <b>profilometry</b> and generalize various computational <b>surface</b> <b>profilometry</b> approaches under different scenarios. Under this framework, first, we investigate two important factors determining the precision of <b>surface</b> <b>profilometry,</b> namely, the condition number of the phaseshift matrix and the fringe contrast within the images of the projected fringe patterns. Then, a regularized phase-shift algorithm has been proposed to improve the reconstruction results at the low contrast regions such as on the substrate of the semiconductor devices. Second, we study the intensity fluctuation caused by the uneven illumination for <b>surface</b> <b>profilometry</b> of moving objects. After that, an illumination-reflectivity-focus model has been suggested to describe the unevenness and an illumination-invariant phase-shift algorithm has been developed to handle this uneven illumination effect. Third, the perspective projection effect from the optics also affects the accurate phase-shift estimation for a moving object. Therefore, we propose a general polynomial phase-measuring profilometry model to establish the relationship between the phase-shift and height variation for each measured point. Accordingly, a polynomial phase-shift algorithm with error compensation technique has been put forward to improve the performance of the <b>surface</b> <b>profilometry</b> for moving objects. Both simulation and real experiments from the prototype have been conducted to verify the improvement on the performance of the proposed methodologies. Furthermore, these research results have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the presented optimization framework for investigating the sources of error for <b>surface</b> <b>profilometry.</b> Moreover, the proposed computational <b>surface</b> <b>profilometry</b> techniques and the corresponding fringe pattern projection systems have been used in automated optical inspection systems for yield improvement on the production line in the semiconductor industry. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

The diffusion process has been designed to maximise process efficiency and coating adhesion, thereby significantly improving the tribological properties of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy — particularly at high contact pressures.

40|$|The {{decrease}} of surface energy of mineral substrates {{similar to those}} used in many stone monuments of cultural heritage by the application of protective polymer coatings along with the simultaneous increase of their surface roughness can increase their ability to repel water substantially. In this work, the effect of artificially induced roughness on the water repellency of mineral substrates coated with protective polymer films was investigated. Natural marble samples or home made calcium carbonate blocks were tried as the mineral substrates. The roughness increase was achieved by mineral chemical etching or by creation of nanoscale binary composition film on the substrate surface. PMMA and PFPE were the polymers used, while different-sized silica nanoparticles were employed for the production of the nanocomposite films. Examination of the coated and uncoated <b>surfaces</b> with <b>profilometry</b> and AFM and measurements of water contact angles reveal a pronounced effect of the surface roughness on water repellency.

40|$|Grain raising, {{the lifting}} of fibres when water is applied to wood surfaces, is a reason why some {{companies}} are reluctant to finish wood products with water-borne coatings. However, the elements that lift-up and cause grain raising have not been identified, {{and the relationship between}} wood density and grain raising has not been clarified. Our work sought answers to both questions. We planed or sanded different woods using aluminum oxide abrasive paper, and characterized <b>surfaces</b> using <b>profilometry</b> and SEM. <b>Surfaces</b> were re-characterized after wetting and drying. Grain raising is inversely related to wood density. In particular, very low-density woods are highly susceptible to grain raising, whereas grain raising does not occur in high-density woods or planed woods. In low-density woods, sanding tears cell walls creating loosely-bonded slivers of wood that project from surfaces, particularly after wetting and drying. This mechanism for grain raising was confirmed by modelling the action of abrasives on wood cell walls using an array of hollow tubes and a serrated tool. Less commonly, fibres and fibre-bundles project from surfaces.

To investigate the physicochemical response of defective wellbore cement to CO 2 -rich brine, we carried out a reactive flow-through experiment using an artificially fractured cement sample at a length of 224. 8 mm. A brine solution with dissolved CO 2 at a pH of approximately 3. 9 was injected through the sample at a constant rate of 0. 0083 cm 3 /s. <b>Surface</b> opti-cal <b>profilometry</b> analysis and 3 -D X-ray microtomography imaging confirmed fracture closure and self-healing behavior consistent with the measured permeability decrease. Visual inspection of the reacted frac-ture surface showed the development of reactive patterns mapping the flow velocity field inside the frac-ture, as well as restricted flow toward the sample outlet. The postexperiment permeability of the core sample was measured at half of its initial permeability. A reactive transport model was developed with parameters derived from the experiment to further examine property evolution of fractured cement under dynamic flow of CO 2 -rich brine. Sensitivity analysis showed that residence time {{and the size of}} initial frac-ture aperture are the key factors controlling the tendency to self-healing or fracture opening behavior and therefore determine the long-term integrity of the wellbore cement. Longer residence time and small aper-tures promote mineral precipitation, fracture closure, and therefore flow restriction.

Three different types of initial surface roughness were applied to the test samples: polished, particle blasted, and milled finishes. For {{each of the three}} test surfaces, cooling curve shifts during repeated heat-quench cycles were accompanied by surface roughening, the shift was smallest with the milled sample. The surface roughness was examined with the aid of scanning electron microscopy, <b>surface</b> contact <b>profilometry,</b> and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Sur-face profiles obtained via the profilometer revealed, on a relative basis, significant changes in surface roughness on the polished and particle blasted surfaces but not on the milled (roughest) surface. The roughening was the result of (a) hydrogen diffusion associated with oxidation, (b) oxidation buildup, and, to a lesser extent, (c) expulsion of impurities along dendrite boundaries. The hydrogen diffusion caused localized pressure buildup within the surface and along grain boundaries resulting in the formation of both microscopic (1 to 10 fim) features on the polished and particle blasted surfaces and relatively large (20 to 1000 pm) bumps and blisters on the particle blasted surface. It is shown how these wide spectrum surface roughness features affect cooling rate by (a) raising the Leidenfrost temperature separating the film and transition boiling regimes, (b) increasing the number of boiling sites on the quenched surface, and (c) altering the impact dynamics of the spray drops. ...|$|R
