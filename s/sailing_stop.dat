They continued their voyage and landed at the court of Lycus, whom Hercules defended in a battle against King Mygdon of Bebryces. After killing King Mygdon, Hercules gave much of the land to his friend Lycus. Lycus called the land Heraclea. The crew then set off for Themiscyra where Hippolyta lived.|$|R

5000|$|To [...] "cut and run" [...] {{was defined}} by Englishman David Steel in 1794 as [...] "to cut the cable and make sail instantly, without waiting to weigh anchor". He further {{described}} the practice as [...] "quick but very expensive" [...] but sometimes necessary, such as when the anchor is hooked on rocks and cannot be retrieved, in bad weather, when the anchor is on lee shore and the ship {{is in danger of}} embayment, or when one must quickly escape or pursue an enemy; instead of cutting the anchor by axe at the hawsehole, Steel offered an alternate method of slipping the anchor cable if time permitted, a method he felt wiser than cutting as it potentially prevented loss of anchor and cable. An alternate origin comes from the practice on square rig ships to furl the <b>sails</b> <b>stopped</b> to the yards with ropeyarns so that the yarns may be cut to let the sails fall unfurled should an urgent need to sail arise. The phrase was in use by the early 1700s, and Oxford English Dictionary cited the earliest printed usage of the phrase to The Boston News-Letter in 1704.|$|R
