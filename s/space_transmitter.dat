40|$|CDL (Common Data Link) is the US military’s {{standard}} communications waveform for Intelligence Surveillance 2 ̆ 6 Reconnaissance (ISR) in airborne platforms. In {{supporting this}} standard, {{the military has}} numerous air, sea and ground CDL systems for theater connectivity. What is missing from current CONOPS are space assets that can bring their tactical ISR data directly into the theater, allowing for responsive tasking and collection. With {{the advent of the}} Space CDL design, we can bring real-time tactical data into existing theater ground stations. Bringing space imagery in-theater from direct tasking is a feat never done before even by large satellites. The in-theater satellite imagery concept will be tested out with a small satellite demonstration, implementing a CDL waveform, using a modified airborne qualified CDL communications system in late 2005. The space qualified CDL design leveraged off a L- 3 airborne design to the greatest extent possible, but several aspects of L- 3 ’s design had to be altered for space applications and operations. Part selection alone was a significant driver in our design approach. Migrating a state-of-the-art, high data rate, communications, airborne design to space is no simple task since the list of approved parts is drastically limited.

The former {{is still under}} development while {{the other one is}} more stable and under space qualification procedure. Thus, in order to give a comprehensive evaluation of both technologies, two PAs were developed in hybrid form for Ultra Wide Band (UWB) terrestrial applications using GaN-on-Si HEMT devices, and another one was developed in monolithic form for <b>space</b> <b>transmitter</b> using the GaN-on-SiC technology. About the hybrid PAs, two different active device peripheries were selected. The first one was a 10 x 100 µm gate periphery named P 10 D and the second one was a 12 x 200 µm gate periphery named P 12 G. The amplifiers were designed in a single ended configuration using the source/load-pull and Scattering parameters measured data. From the expected performances, the PA built with P 10 D has an operative bandwidth from 1 GHz to 7 GHz with a saturated output power higher than 37 dBm while the other one has an operative bandwidth from 1 GHz to 6 GHz with a saturated output power around 41 dBm. Instead, the HPA designed using GaN-on-SiC technology, represents the first step towards the realization of a fully integrated GaN transmitter for X-Band space applications. In this case, experimental results shown that the HPA reaches an output power higher than 41 dBm with a gain higher than 17 dBm and a ripple lower than 0. 5 dB from 8. 6 GHz to 10. 6 GHz frequency range in a chip area lower than 10 mm...|$|E

40|$|Fading or {{attenuation}} of {{a signal}} due to environment {{is a phenomenon}} often en-countered in wireless communications. It is expected that co-located transmitters i. e. transmitters placed very {{close to each other}} show a high signal fading correlation due to the presence of similar fading environment. In this thesis, we present an experimental study of this phenomenon. Correlation of received signal strengths obtained from co-located transmitters in dynamically vary-ing environments indicate that the large scale signal variations (shadow fading) are highly correlated while the small scale variations (multipath or fast fading) show a low correlation. Highly correlated large scale variations suggest a presence of same large shadowing elements in the transmit-receive path while a low correlation among the multipath variations is due to mutual coupling between the antennas at very close dis-tances. This has two implications: it suggests that shadow fading variations can serve as an indicator of the co-location of closely <b>spaced</b> <b>transmitters</b> while the multipath variations cannot. However, low multipath signal correlations suggest that antenna diversity could be investigated for implementation in mobile handsets...|$|R

40|$|Water {{with even}} {{a small amount of}} {{dissolved}} solids has an electrical conductivity orders of magnitude higher than dry rock and is therefore a near-ideal exploration target on Mars for low frequency, diffusive electromagnetic methods. Models of the temperature- and frequency-dependent electrical properties of rock-ice-water mixtures are used to predict the electromagnetic response of the Martian subsurface. Detection of ice is difficult unless it is massively segregated. In contrast, liquid water profoundly affects soundings, and {{even a small}} amount of adsorbed water in the cryosphere can be detected. Subcryospheric water is readily distinguishable at frequencies as low as 100 Hz for fresh water to 10 mHz for brines. These responses can be measured using either natural or artificial sources. Ultra low frequency signals from solar wind and diurnal-heating perturbations of the ionosphere are likely, and disturbances of regional crustal magnetic fields may also be observable. Spherics, or extremely to very low frequency signals from lightning discharge, would provide optimal soundings; however, lightning may be the least likely of the possible natural sources. Among the active techniques, only the time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) method can accommodate a closely <b>spaced</b> <b>transmitter</b> and receiver and sound to depths of hundreds of meters or more.
