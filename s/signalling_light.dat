6000|$|Mistress Thankful {{remained}} at the wall until her lover had disappeared. Then she turned, a mere lissom shadow in that uncertain light, and glided under the eaves of the shed, and thence {{from tree to tree}} of the orchard, lingering a moment under each as a trout lingers {{in the shadow of the}} bank in passing a shallow, and so reached the farmhouse and the kitchen door, where she entered. Thence by a back staircase she slipped to her own bower, from whose window half an hour before she had taken the <b>signalling</b> <b>light.</b> This she lit again and placed upon a chest of drawers; and, taking off her hood and a shapeless sleeveless mantle she had worn, went to the mirror, and proceeded to re-adjust a high horn comb that had been somewhat displaced by the captain's arm, and otherwise after the fashion of her sex to remove all traces of a previous lover. It may be here observed that a man is very apt to come from the smallest encounter with his dulcinea distrait, bored, or shame-faced; to forget that his cravat is awry, or that a long blond hair is adhering to his button. But as to Mademoiselle--well, looking at Miss Pussy's sleek paws and spotless face, would you ever know that she had been at the cream-jug? ...|$|E
50|$|The Pisans {{built in}} 1157 on a {{surfacing}} rock of the Meloria shoal a lighthouse {{in order to}} avoid the wrecking of the ships directed to Porto Pisano. It was decided to keep a navigational light giving the task to the Augustinians monks of the hermitage of San Jacopo in Acquaviva by Livorno signing a written agreement for the work.The tower was destroyed by the Genoese. A second tower was built in 1598 on order of Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, which in its turn was destroyed by the bad weather.The current tower was built in 1709 by Cosimo III de' Medici and has a characteristic form; it is formed by four quadrangular pillars connected by Gothic arches above which arise the tower 15 meters high. The tower was built on the pillars to allow the flow of the waves but had no <b>signalling</b> <b>light.</b> On the south side of the tower is the Latin inscription: “Pro navigntium securitate ad latentes copulo evitandos” (For the sailors safety pay attention to the reef). In 1986 the tower underwent to a complete renovation.|$|E
40|$|The flux of Ca 2 + from excised tomato leaves, condi-tioned in 100 mM KCI for 60 min, {{was shown}} to be {{affected}} by turning an incandescent light (32 //mol m" 2 s 1) on or off. Calcium concentrations were measured with a single junction combination electrode con-nected to a high impedence electrometer amplifier interfaced with a microcomputer. Net Ca 2 + fluxes from excised leaves 30 s prior to and 30 s after turning on the light were 68 and 122 pmol g 1 dry weight s respectively. The Ca 2 + fluxes for the 30 s prior to and 30 s after turning off the light were 113 and 51 pmol g 1 dry weight s respectively. Close examination of the first 10 s after the light was turned off showed that there was a 4 s delay in the flux of Ca 2 +. The heat given off by the incandescent bulb had no effect on Ca 2 + flux during these short time periods. The effect of light on the Ca 2 + flux was evident for at least 2 h after the initial treatment. Key words: Ca 2 +, <b>signalling,</b> <b>light,</b> tomato...|$|E
40|$|Polarization-dependent gain (PDG) {{and state}} of {{polarization}} (SOP) of the output <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> in Yb 3 +-doped fiber amplifiers are studied by numerically stimulation, {{which showed that}} PDG of output <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> is not only changed with the input pump power and signal power, input polarization of pump and <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> but also changed with the doping concentration, the cross-section anisotropy, the fiber length,the phase difference of the fiber, and so on. Moreover, SOP of the output <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> is studied. It is found that the polarization of output <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> is relative {{not only to the}} phase difference of the fiber,polarization of pump and <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> as the non-doped fiber, but also to PDG of output <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> the cross-section anisotropy, the doping concentration, and so on, which is different to the non-doped fiber...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model of light controlling {{light in a}} multi-atom cavity QED system consisting of three-level atoms confined in a cavity and interacting with a control laser from free space. A signal laser is coupled into the cavity and provides two output light channels: the transmitted <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> through the cavity and the reflected <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> from the cavity. We show that with the cavity electromagnetically induced transparency manifested by the free-space control light, the amplitude and the phase of the intra-cavity <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> can be manipulated by the free-space control laser. We analyze the cavity transmitted <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> and the cavity reflected <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> and show that the two output channels of the <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> are complementary and the cavity-atom system is a versatile system for studies of alloptical switching and cross-phase modulation at low control intensities...|$|R

40|$|Rod and cone photoreceptors detect {{light and}} relay this {{information}} through a multisynaptic pathway {{to the brain}} by means of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). These retinal outputs support not only pattern vision but also non-image-forming (NIF) functions, which include circadian photoentrainment and pupillary light reflex (PLR). In mammals, NIF functions are mediated by rods, cones and the melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Rod-cone photoreceptors and ipRGCs are complementary in <b>signalling</b> <b>light</b> intensity for NIF functions. The ipRGCs, {{in addition to being}} directly photosensitive, also receive synaptic input from rod-cone networks. To determine how the ipRGCs relay rod-cone light information for both image-forming and non-image-forming functions, we genetically ablated ipRGCs in mice. Here we show that animals lacking ipRGCs retain pattern vision but have deficits in both PLR and circadian photoentrainment that are more extensive than those observed in melanopsin knockouts. The defects in PLR and photoentrainment resemble those observed in animals that lack phototransduction in all three photoreceptor classes. These results indicate that light signals for irradiance detection are dissociated from pattern vision at the retinal ganglion cell level, and animals that cannot detect light for NIF functions are still capable of image formation...|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{is one of}} {{the worst}} problems in many countries. Traffic congestion wastes a huge portion of the national income for fuel and traffic-related environmental and socioeconomic problems. Computer simulation is a powerful tool for analyzing complex and dynamic scenarios. It provides an appealing approach to analyze repetitive processes. Simulation helps decision makers identify different possible options by analyzing enormous amounts of data. Hence, computer simulation can be used effectively to analyze traffic flow patterns and <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing. This paper discusses a special-purpose simulation (SPS) tool for optimize traffic <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing. The simulation model is capable of optimizing <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing at a single junction as well as an actual road network with multiple junctions. It also provides <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing for certain time periods according to traffic demand.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} photon {{statistics and}} quadrature squeezing {{of the signal}} mode produced by one-mode subharmonic generator.

We have also shown that the photon energy quadrature squeezing of the output signal mode is exactly equal to that of the cavity <b>signal</b> mode. In <b>light</b> of this, the global quadrature squeezing of the signal mode is independent of the mean photon ener-gy.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{recognizing}} <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> in traeic scenes {{in real time}} has been developed.

In order to be classified as part of the image of an active <b>signaling</b> <b>light,</b> a set of pixels must pass each one of these filters. This multifilter approach is model-based, and it comprises much of the available knowledge about <b>signaling</b> <b>lights.</b> In addition to color, this includes characteristics like the locations of the lights relative to the vehicle, their size, symmetry, and blinking frequencies. The individual filters, and the way how they cooperate, have been designed {{in such a way that}} the system recognizes active <b>signaling</b> <b>lights</b> reliably, while false alarms are largely avoided.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} a novel receiver {{in visible light}} communication system based on RGB LEDs. It contains three major parts the collimating lens, the spectro-device and the photodetector. The mixed RGB <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> are captured, separated and received by the collimating lens the spectro-device and the photodetector respectively. Through the adjustment of the collimating lens, the receiver can receive enough light even if {{the distance between the}} <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> source and the receiver is changed. The receiver has the advantages of strong mobility and strong ability of receiving <b>signal</b> <b>light.</b> Based on the designed receiver the high-speed visible light communication system using RGB wavelength division multiplexing technology can have better performance...|$|R

5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with signal flags (during daylight) and <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> (at night). <b>Signal</b> <b>lights,</b> which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|R

In experiments at the University of Karlsruhe we studied the dependency between reaction time and overlap of <b>signal</b> <b>lights.</b> We can see, that the total overlap from a yellow turn signal and a red brake signal will increase the reaction time.
