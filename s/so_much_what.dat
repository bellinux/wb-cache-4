25|$|An {{important}} part of Scouting education is the personal example of the leader. The Scout is impressed by the leader because of his age, his knowledge, and his position as a leader. If the leader is popular, leadership {{will be seen as}} an attractive goal, and the Scout will follow the example of the leader. The Scoutmaster living the Scout law will have more influence than one who simply talks about it. In the boys' eyes it is what a man does that counts and not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>what</b> he says.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Bennett, in 1994, {{discussed}} the poem's effectiveness: [...] "What {{is important and}} compelling in this poem is not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>what</b> happens on the urn or in the poem, but {{the way that a}} response to an artwork both figures and prefigures its own critical response". In 1999, Andrew Motion claimed that the poem [...] "tells a story that cannot be developed. Celebrating the transcendent powers of art, it creates a sense of imminence, but also registers a feeling of frustration." [...] Ayumi Mizukoshi, in 2001, argued that early audiences did not support [...] "Ode to Psyche" [...] because it [...] "turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture. For the same reason, the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' drew neither attention nor admiration. Although the poet is gazing round the surface of the urn in each stanza, the poem cannot readily be consumed as a series of 'idylls'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The FBI Summary Report {{proceeds}} to say: [...] "From this analysis, two possible hidden meanings emerged: (1) 'FNY' – a verbal assault on New York, and (2) PAT – the nickname of [...] Former Colleague #2." [...] Ivins {{was known to}} have a dislike for New York City, and four of the media letters {{had been sent to}} New York. The report states that it [...] "was obviously impossible for the Task Force to determine with certainty that either of these two translations was correct", however, [...] "the key point to the investigative analysis {{is that there is a}} hidden message, not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>what</b> that message is". According to the FBI, Ivins showed a fascination with codes and also had an interest in secrets and hidden messages, and was familiar with biochemical codons.|$|E
