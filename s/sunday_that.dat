5|$|A {{week later}} the whale was found dead, {{floating}} out at sea. It was towed to Stonehaven and dragged onto the beach. John Struthers, the Regius professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen, quickly visited the carcass, recording it as 40 feet long with flukes measuring 11 feet 4 inches. A local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale {{and had it}} transported to his yard in Dundee. On the first <b>Sunday</b> <b>that</b> it was there, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E
5|$|Conwell {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on December 2, 1820. The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy that preceded Conwell's arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, William Hogan, {{approached}} de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia. After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan {{was assigned to}} St. Mary's Church. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy. Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already {{moved out of the}} priests' residence at Old St. Joseph's Church to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one <b>Sunday</b> <b>that</b> neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.|$|E

25|$|Due to a {{less than}} {{favorable}} forecast for Kennedy Space Center on <b>Sunday</b> <b>that</b> was not expected to improve by Monday, mission managers decided to call up Edwards Air Force Base {{for the first day}} of landing opportunities. There were two KSC opportunities, with two more opportunities for Edwards later in the day. If the first two opportunities at KSC were called off due to weather, Bryan Lunney, Entry Flight Director stated during the Mission Status Briefing that they would take the Edwards opportunities; the weather was not likely to improve, so there would be no reason to delay landing for a day. The forecast at KSC called for thunderstorms within 30 miles of the landing site, as well as high crosswinds, both conditions that would violate the weather constraints for landing.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} this {{scheduling}} dilemma {{was the fact that}} the NBA had opted to start the regular season earlier. Starting in the mid-1970s, the NBA had pushed back the start of the regular season, resulting in it ending increasingly later (for example, April 6 in 1975, April 11 in 1976). Prior to that, the regular season had always ended in late March. For the 1979–1980 and 1980–1981 seasons, the NBA reverted to the earlier practice, with the season ending respectively on March 30, 1980 and March 29, 1981 (both falling on a <b>Sunday).</b> <b>That</b> meant that the Finals in those years began in the first week of May rather than the end of May, and as a result, the weeknight games were played during May ratings sweeps. Consequently, weeknight games held on the West Coast started at 8:30p.m. Pacific Time, which was 11:30p.m. in the Eastern Time Zone; those games could be shown live. However, non-West Coast weeknight games required tape-delay, to be shown at 11:30p.m.|$|E

500|$|The Lutheran {{calendar}} {{operates on}} two different cycles: the Temporal Cycle and the Sanctoral Cycle. The Temporal Cycle pivots on the festivals of Christmas and Easter. All Sundays, Seasons, and Festivals are related to these festivals. Because Easter varies in date each year based on the vernal equinox and the phases of the moon, it is called a moveable feast (see: Computus). Dates affected by placement of Easter include Ash Wednesday {{and the start of}} Lent, the start of Easter itself, Pentecost, and Holy Trinity. Advent, the other pivotal season on the calendar, comes exactly four Sundays before the start of Christmas (if Christmas falls on a <b>Sunday,</b> <b>that</b> day does not count), or the Sunday closest to St. Andrew's Day (November 30). Like the other Western Church calendars, the first Sunday of Advent is also {{the first day of the}} liturgical year. [...] The Sanctoral Cycle is the fixed daily commemorations of individuals and events not related to the Temporal Cycle of Sundays, Festivals, and Seasons. [...] It is the Sanctoral Cycle which is sometimes thought of as being the “Calendar of Saints” of a Church.|$|E
500|$|Writer John Sullivan had {{the idea}} for a prequel to the sitcom Only Fools and Horses in 1997; its {{commission}} was announced in 2003 and the premise for the series was established in the final Only Fools and Horses episode [...] "Sleepless in Peckham" [...] in 2003, where Rodney discovers a photograph of Freddie Robdal from 1960. His uncanny resemblance to Rodney confirmed that he, and not Reg, was Rodney's biological father. A lot of the groundwork for this had been both laid and explored in the Episode [...] "The Frog's Legacy" [...] the 1987 Christmas Day hour-long special. In the episode Rodney goes to ask about his father to which Albert diplomatically replies 'They're rumours Rodney. That's all. Rumours.' The proposed prequel, was to be titled Once Upon a Time in Peckham, it would see young versions of Del, Boycie, Denzil and Trigger, and Sullivan said [...] "Joanie will be a key character, and during the film will give birth to Rodney." [...] However, the prequel was shelved, and spin-off The Green Green Grass was developed to follow secondary characters, Boycie, Marlene and their son Tyler, as they escape the London Mafia and attempt to live in the Shropshire countryside. It was reported in January 2009 that the prequel was being considered again, following the success of The Green Green Grass. In April 2009, Sullivan told The Mail on <b>Sunday</b> <b>that</b> he had started writing the prequel, and that Lyndhurst was [...] "keen" [...] to play Robdal, a local criminal and Rodney's biological father, although the production had yet to be commissioned.|$|E
