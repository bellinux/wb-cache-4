40|$|<b>Stud</b> <b>mount</b> accelerometers {{are widely}} used by the {{aerospace}} industry to measure shock environments during hardware qualification. The commonly used contact-based sensors, however, interfere with the shock waves and distort the acquired signature, which is a concern not actively discussed in the community. To alleviate these interference issues, engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are investigating the use of non-intrusive sensors, specifically Laser Doppler Vibrometers, as alternatives to the stud mounted accelerometers. This paper will describe shock simulation tests completed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, compare the measurements from stud mounted accelerometers and Laser Doppler Vibrometers, and discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of introducing Laser Doppler Vibrometers as alternative sensors for measuring shock environments...|$|E
40|$|Instrumentation {{difficulties}} {{encountered in}} the previous reporting period were addressed early in this reporting period, resulting in a new instrumentation configuration {{that appears to be}} free of the noise issues found previously. This permitted the collection of flow calibration data to begin. The first issues in question are the effects of the type and location of the transducer mount. Data were collected for 15 different transducer positions (upstream and downstream of an elbow in the pipe), with both a <b>stud</b> <b>mount</b> and a magnetic transducer mount, for each of seven combinations of air and coal flow. Analysis of these data shows that the effects of the transducer mount type and location on the resulting dynamics are complicated, and not easily captured in a single analysis. To maximize the practical value of the calibration data, further detailed calibration data will be collected with both the magnetic and stud mounts, but at a single mounting location just downstream of a pipe elbow. This testing will be performed in the Coal Flow Test Facility in the next reporting period. The program progress in this reporting period was sufficient to put us essentially back on schedule...|$|E

5000|$|The Mark IV {{differed}} from the W-series engine was in {{the placement of the}} valves and the shape of the combustion chambers. Gone was the chamber-in-block design of the W-series engine (which caused the power curve to drastically dip above 6500 RPM), and in its place was a more conventional wedge chamber in the cylinder head, which was now attached to a conventional 90 degree deck. The valves continued to use the displaced arrangement of the W-series engine, but were also inclined so that they would open away from the combustion chamber and cylinder walls, a design feature made possible by Chevrolet's <b>stud</b> <b>mounted</b> rocker arms. This alteration in valve placement resulted in a significant improvement in volumetric efficiency at high RPM and a substantial increase in power output at racing speeds. Owing to the appearance of the compound angularity of the valves, the automotive press dubbed the engine the [...] "porcupine" [...] design.|$|R

40|$|The use of accelerometers {{to monitor}} the {{vibrations}} of either complex machinery or simple component involves some considerations about the mounting of the sensor to the structure. Different types of mounting solutions are commonly used but in all cases they can be classified {{in one of these}} categories: <b>stud</b> <b>mounting,</b> screw mounting, adhesive mounting, magnetic mounting and probe sensing. Indeed each of them has a specific field of application depending on e. g. the mounting surface conditions, the temperature, the accessibility to the specific mounting point, etc. The choice of the mounting solution has a important effect on the accuracy of the usable frequency response of the accelerometer, since the higher the stiffness of the fixing, the higher the low-pass frequency limit of the mounting. This paper specifically focuses on adhesive mounting of accelerometers, which includes a great number of different products from the temporary adhesives like the beeswax to the permanent ones like cyanoacrylate polymers. Among the variety of commercial adhesives, three specific glues have been experimentally compared to assess their transmissivity and the results are reported in this paper. A two component methylmethacrylate (HBM X 60), a modified silane (Terostat 737) and a cyanoacrylate (Loctite 401) adhesives have been used to joint two aluminium bases, one connected to an accelerometer and the other to the head of electromagnetic shaker. A design of experiments (DOE) approach was used to test the system at several levels of amplitude and frequency of the external sinusoidal excitation supplied by the shaker...|$|R

50|$|Another {{problem with}} the {{cylinder}} heads was the arrangement of cylinder head fixing studs, half of which were vertical {{and the other half}} at an angle. The angled studs when heated and cooled, expanded and contracted at a different rate to the alloy heads, causing sideways forces which caused premature failure of the cylinder head gaskets. Anecdotally this arrangement was to reduce production costs as the cylinder head <b>mounting</b> <b>studs</b> and bolt were all accessible with the rocker covers fitted. This allowed the factory to completely assemble the cylinder head assembly before fitting to the engine. However this was not possible in the end due to the cam chain fitting and setting of the cam timing requiring the removal of the rocker covers.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{characterization}} of metallic <b>studs</b> used to <b>mount</b> lightweight double wall systems is studied both experimentally and numerically. The metallic studs are usually considered by introducing translational and rotational springs to couple the plasterboards composing the double wall. Therefore, {{the characterization}} involves determining these spring characteristics. The performance {{of this type of}} lightweight double wall in terms of sound transmission is presented in a companion paper. Different experimental setups have been investigated to determine the equivalent translational and rotational spring values. These experimental setups are described and involve the measurement of an input mobility. A finite element model of the laboratory tests has been developed.

40|$|By using industrialized building, pre-installed modules can be {{delivered}} to the construction site where they are easily mounted. This method has many advantages compared to on-site manufacturing, for example, the precision during the production process should be much higher than building each wall and floor on site.

40|$|In this study, {{the impact}} of {{anthropogenic}} in-stream structures on migration and dispersal {{of a variety of}} fish species was investigated. The effectiveness of attempted restoration of longitudinal connectivity in fragmented stream and river systems, through implementation of various fish pass designs, both technical and nature oriented, was evaluated for fish of varying age classes. The outcomes of this research are of importance for river management schemes that aim to restore degraded freshwater systems bound by legislation from the EU Water Framework Directive, which requires good connectivity and habitat quality within freshwater systems. 	Fish community composition in relation to effects of in-stream structures and habitat conditions was investigated on three degraded stream networks, so that future opportunities for longitudinal connectivity restoration could be identified. Differences in fish community composition above and below common types of structures were determined, whereby species richness and density per species showed greatest differences for flow manipulating culvert structures, especially pipe culverts. 	Obstacle effects on fish dispersal and migration, and the effectiveness of connectivity restoration - obstacle removal and design of various types of fish passes - on those same obstacles were evaluated using a variety of approaches. These included capture-mark-recapture of different life stages of a weak swimmer (European bullhead Cottus perifretum) and of a strong swimmer (brown trout Salmo trutta) tagged with passive integrated transponder (PIT) and/or visible implant elastomer (VIE), displacement studies of juvenile trout and radio telemetry of adult freshwater-resident and sea-going morphotypes of brown trout. Longitudinal connectivity for fish was shown to have improved post-restoration, exemplified by improved fish passage over the multiple structures in both directions, while permeability of unrestored structures remained low. 	The efficacy of a technical Larinier super active baffle fish pass, a widespread design in Europe, was assessed for upstream-migrating adult river lamprey. Situated next to a common Crump weir, the pass was designed to facilitate passage {{for a wide range of}} fish species. Over two migration seasons, with a variety of flow levels occurring in both, the pass was tested for efficacy before and after modification with <b>studded</b> tiles <b>mounted</b> on the inside wall. By using fixed PIT arrays, poor passage through the fish pass by river lamprey was shown before modification, and improved marginally post-modification. Acoustic telemetry identified direct passage over the weir to be two-fold higher than through the modified fish pass. 	In the context of the Water Framework Directive, there is a strong need to develop well-grounded fish passage criteria, not only for fish species with strong swimming capacity, but for a wide range of fish species and life stages. Ideally, all types of fishways should be critically assessed, in situ, to allow river managers to make more informed decisions on restoring fragmented stream systems. ...|$|R
