Thus, changes in the average coolant temperature, notably from the <b>steam</b> <b>demand</b> of engine throttles, naturally maintains reactor power without intervention from a reactor operator.|$|E

50|$|Reactor {{pressure}} in a BWR {{is controlled by}} the main turbine or main steam bypass valves. Unlike a PWR, where the turbine <b>steam</b> <b>demand</b> is set manually by the operators, in a BWR, the turbine valves will modulate to maintain reactor pressure at a setpoint. Under this control mode, the turbine will automatically follow reactor power changes. When the turbine is offline or trips, the main steam bypass/dump valves will open to direct steam directly to the condenser. These bypass valves will automatically or manually modulate as necessary to maintain reactor pressure and control the reactor's heatup and cooldown rates while steaming is still in progress.|$|E
50|$|The most {{frequent}} cause {{is running the}} locomotive with too high a level {{of water in the}} boiler and is most apparent when the regulator is opened sharply or <b>steam</b> <b>demand</b> is high. Thus, sensible locomotive management by the operators will help to prevent the occurrence. The phenomenon is particularly evident in areas of impure water, where boiled water creates a foam, or a mist of droplets, filling the space that collects steam {{at the top of the}} boiler, to be drawn down the steam collector pipe in the form of slugs of water. If boiler water is condensed and re-used, any oil or grease must be extracted as this form of contamination is particularly likely to give trouble.|$|E

These water treatments often include compounds forming a sludge to entrap such particles; and boilers intended for such water treatment include a structure called a mud drum at the lowest part of the boiler. Bottom blowdown involves periodically opening valves in the mud drum to allow boiler pressure to force accumulated sludge out of the boiler. Similar blowdown connections at the bottom of water wall headers are blown down less frequently. [...] Several short blowdown events remove sludge more effectively than a single continuous blowdown. Shorter blowdown events cause less significant changes in boiler water level, and are safer during periods of high <b>steam</b> <b>demand.</b>|$|E

This study investigates profitability of DME production from gasified black liquor at a kraft pulp mill, based on the Chemrec BLG technology.

40|$|In this paper, two ethanol {{processes}} {{integrated with}} a softwood pulp mill are compared {{with regard to}} their <b>steam</b> <b>demand,</b> process integration potential and profitability. The processes differ in the solids loading in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation step and in the resulting ethanol concentration. The results show that a higher ethanol concentration does not necessarily lead to significant reductions in <b>steam</b> <b>demand.</b> Instead, it is demonstrated that the <b>steam</b> <b>demand</b> for distillation is highly dependent on the design of the distillation plant. Nevertheless, a higher solids loading (high gravity) can be beneficial for the treatment of the stillage from the distillation plant. A higher solids loading results either in a lower <b>steam</b> <b>demand</b> for evaporation of the stillage or possibly in a reduced demand for effluent treatment compared to a conventional solids loading process. While the results show that a higher ethanol concentration leads to advantages in energy costs and investment costs for the distillation plant, they also show that the potential benefits of a high-gravity process are offset by the expected decrease in ethanol yield, which leads to higher raw material costs.

OptiVap uses Excel and the built-in Solver to find energy-efficient evaporation plants. The outputs from OptiVap are, for example, the live <b>steam</b> <b>demand,</b> the required heat transfer area and the investment cost. In OptiVap, we can also simulate the consequences of integrating other process units with the evaporation plant. We can e. g. simulate the energy savings of using excess heat in the evaporation plant (process-integrated evaporation) and the evaporation consequences of separating lignin from the black liquor. To illustrate the use of OptiVap, we show that different strategies {{can be used to}} optimise evaporation plants. The strategies are symbolised by three objective functions: 1) minimise the <b>steam</b> <b>demand,</b> 2) minimise the heat transfer area and 3) maximise the net annual profit. The simulations are performed for evaporator trains with 6 - 8 effects, which make use of excess heat from the mill to decrease the live <b>steam</b> <b>demand.</b> The resulting evaporation plants have practically the same profitability, which means that any of the three objective functions can be used to find suitable evaporation plants. Moreover, the first two objective functions do not require any knowledge of the final energy system {{which brings us to the}} conclusion that these objective functions are most practical and should thus be used in most cases...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to apply a Model Predictive Fuzzy Controller (MPC and Takagi-Sugeno) to a {{specific}} Steam Boiler Plant. This is a very common problem in control. The considered plant {{is based on the}} descriptions obtained from the data of a referenced boiler in the combined cycle plant as Abbot in Champaign, Illinois. The idea is to take all the useful data from the boiler according to its performance and capability in different operation points in order to model the most accurate plant for control. The considered case study is based in a modification of a model proposed by Pellegrinetti and Bentsman in 1996, considering to be tested under the demands of the Control Engineering Association (CEA). The system is Multi-Input and Multi-Output (MIMO), where each controlled output has a specific weight in order to measure the performance. The objective is to minimize cost index but also make it operative and robust {{for a wide range of}} variables, discovering the limits of the plant and its behaviour. The model is supposed to manage real data and was constructed under real physical descriptions. However, this model is not a white box, so the analysis and development of the model to be used with the MPC strategy have to be identified to continue with the evaluation of the controlled plant. There are some physical variables that have to be taken into account (Drum Pressure, Excess of Oxygen, Water Level, Water Flow, Fuel Flow, Air Flow and <b>Steam</b> <b>Demand)</b> to know if these variables and other parameters are evolving in the correct way and satisfy the logic of the mass and energy balances in the system. After measuring and analysing the data, the model is validated testing it for different values of steam demands. The controller is tuned for every one of the considered demands. Once tuned, the controller computes the manipulated variables receiving information from the controlled ones, including their references. Finally, the resulting controller is a combination of a set of local controllers using the Takagi-Sugeno approach using the <b>steam</b> <b>demand</b> setpoint as scheduling variable. To apply this approach, a set of local models approximating the non-linear boiler behaviour around a set of <b>steam</b> <b>demand</b> set-points are obtained and then their a fused using the Takagi-Sugeno approach to approximate any unknown <b>steam</b> <b>demand</b> located in the valid range of values...|$|E

40|$|An {{increase}} {{in the production of}} pulp is of economic interest to many kraft pulp mills. However, significant increases in production generally require the recovery boiler to be debottlenecked: it must either be rebuilt or replaced. Both options require costly investments that can be avoided by extracting lignin from the black liquor before it is burnt in the boiler. This, in turn, requires changes being made in the evaporation plant. In the present study, simulations have been carried out based on a 25 % {{increase in}} the production of pulp. The evaporation plants are simulated with and without an integrated lignin separation plant to investigate the consequences of extracting lignin from black liquor. The results show that the evaporation plants with lignin extraction have investment costs that are 5 - 30 % higher than an equivalent plant without lignin extraction. Furthermore, the evaporation plants with lignin extraction require an evaporation capacity that is 7 % higher, since filtrates from the lignin separation plant are also evaporated here. This increases the <b>steam</b> <b>demand</b> by 9 - 12 % compared with a plant without lignin extraction.
