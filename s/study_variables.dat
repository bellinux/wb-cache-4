Separately, the journal editor and the principal investigator of the NCS (from which Coleman had drawn her data) opined that, {{in light of the}} concerns raised, Coleman et al.'s analysis [...] "does not support their assertions that abortions led to psychopathology." [...] Despite the correction, further concerns about the accuracy of Coleman's analysis were raised; Coleman responded to these criticisms and pointed to other work she had published.|$|E

30|$|Participants in {{the current}} study were working in 102 teams, so it was {{possible}} that the nested data were non-independent. Thus, intra-class coefficients (ICCs; Shrout and Fleiss 1979) of the <b>study</b> <b>variables</b> were computed. The ICC 1 s, which indicate the variance explained by group membership, were 0.25 for WIF, 0.07 for decision authority, 0.12 for job satisfaction, and 0.08 for OCB. The ICC 2 s, which indicate the reliability of group means, were 0.51 for WIF, 0.20 for decision authority, 0.31 for job satisfaction, and 0.22 for OCB. According to Kenny (1995), an ICC 1 of 0.01 is considered a small group effect, 0.10 is considered a medium group effect, and 0.15 a large effect. Given that the ICC 1 s of <b>study</b> <b>variables</b> {{in the current}} research ranged from 0.07 to 0.25 when treating the team as a group variable, there was a considerable group effect regarding the current research model. We used a hierarchical linear model (HLM) to eliminate the group effect. Group-level variances of all <b>study</b> <b>variables</b> were controlled in the subsequent analysis.|$|E

40|$|For {{estimating}} the population variance S 2 y of <b>study</b> <b>variable</b> y, {{a class of}} chain estimators of S 2 y has been proposed {{in the presence of}} two auxiliary variables x and z by using known information on population mean and variance of the second auxiliary variable z. In this proposed class, the second auxiliary variable z is directly highly correlated with the first auxiliary variable x, whereas the variable z is correlated with the variable y due to only the high correlation between the variables y and x. Another generalized class of estimators of S 2 y has also been considered by using the same available information of auxiliary variable z when both the auxiliary variables x and z are directly highly correlated with the <b>study</b> <b>variable</b> y. The asymptotic expressions for the mean square errors and their optimum values have been obtained. A comparison between the two proposed classes of estimators of S 2 y has been made empirically.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study tested {{the research hypothesis}} that among African Americans in Metropolitan Detroit, neighborhood satisfaction, stress and perception of racism influence obesity differently based on income. The three expected results for the data were as follows: income {{does not have a}} link to obesity; links between BMI and the <b>study</b> <b>variables</b> (neighborhood satisfaction, stress, and perceived racism) vary according to income category; and the <b>study</b> <b>variables</b> (neighborhood satisfaction, stress, and perceived racism) influence the variability of BMI differently according to income category. The results indicate that there are no income differences in how the <b>study</b> <b>variables</b> influence obesity. Therefore, the hypothesis is rejected. It must also be concluded that for the study population, there is no support for {{the idea that there is}} equifinality in becoming obese based on income. However, this study supports previous observations that SES no longer has an influence on the distribution of obesity. In addition, it reveals that a combination of a person 2 ̆ 7 s sex and income level may expose a person to different types or levels of obesity-influencing factors. For decades, the assumption was that differential access to resources makes some people more susceptible to obesity. However, as more segments of society are becoming overweight and obese, support for this assumption disappears. Instead, exposure to obesity-influencing stressors is what is important. Since none of the <b>study</b> <b>variables</b> is associated with BMI, then perhaps other variables would be more appropriate to focus on for the study population. Changes in physical activity, shifts in what is considered an acceptable body image, and/or dietary habits may reflect income differences in developing obesity among African Americans...|$|E
