[...] Seth Gabel was also happy with Wyman's direction, as the two were able to discuss themes in the script {{as well as how}} Wyman planned to shoot certain scenes. Gabel remarked that the {{director}} [...] "wanted to do this fun thing that actually related to Lincoln's feelings about Olivia and how they were changing based on everything that's been happening.

Speaking of the miscarriage {{and the end of}} Liam and Steffy's marriage, Wood explained: [...] "She is obviously trying a reason to get out of it. In her heart and soul, she wants to be with him. She felt he was her soulmate, but with everything that has happened, she feels it was her fault and she can't change that. She should never have gotten on that motorcycle and he told her not to. There have been <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> happened that it opens her eyes to the possibility that maybe he should be with Hope." [...] Upon Steffy's brief return to the show in 2015, she realizes that she still loves Liam, despite believing that these feelings were gone.

[...] Despite liking the fact that Steffy [...] "speaks up" [...] and [...] "fights for love", Wood said that she wanted [...] "to see someone come in and sweep her off her feet and take that pain away", not wanting her to fight for [...] "a man that flip flops". However, Liam is involved with Steffy's cousin Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy does not win him back. Wood noted that [...] "in Steffy's mind, Ivy is just some new woman in town and Liam is fair game. He and Ivy have no history." [...] Eventually Liam breaks up with Ivy and after Steffy's marriage to Wyatt breaks down, Steffy and Liam rekindle their love and romance and they marry each other again for the third time.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, John Paul II's {{successor}} Pope Benedict XVI {{spoke of}} Saint Catherine of Genoa (1447–1510) and how despite the view in her {{time that the}} purification of souls (Purgatory) was pictured as a location in space, the saint saw Purgatory as a purifying inner fire, such as she experienced in her profound sorrow for sins committed, when compared with God's infinite love. She said that being bound still to the desires and suffering that derive from sin {{makes it impossible for}} of God. The Pope commented: [...] "We too feel how distant we are, how full we are of <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we cannot see God. The soul is aware of the immense love and perfect justice of God and consequently suffers for having failed to respond in a correct and perfect way to this love; and love for God itself becomes a flame, love itself cleanses it from the residue of sin." ...|$|E
2500|$|Drummer Tony Williams was {{an early}} influence. [...] "The first drummer I ever saw, where I got to feel the impact up close, was Tony Williams", Blackman said. [...] "When I was 16, Tony came to my local drum store with a bassist and did a [...] clinic that left a {{powerful}} impression on me. And that's what I thought drumming should be: drummers should {{have a lot of}} impact and a great sound, without being limited to a conventional role in the band—the drums should speak just as freely as anybody."

He had <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> elevated the sound and the level of skill required to play this kind of music." [...] But although Blackman is sometimes referred to as a disciple of Tony Williams, she follows her own path. [...] "On the one hand, it doesn't bother me at all to be associated and in line with a master of the instrument like that – Okay, I might not be where I want to be, but I'm on the right track", says Blackman. [...] "On the other hand, I don't plan on being a clone. What I'm doing is always looking to expound on something that he's done, or push the music in a different way".|$|E
