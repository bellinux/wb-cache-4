50|$|The above {{process can}} be likened to the mail system in which a letter (SDU) is placed in an {{envelope}} on which is written an address (addressing and control information) making it a PDU. The <b>sending</b> post <b>office</b> might look only at the post code and place the letter in a mail bag so that the address on the envelope {{can no longer be}} seen, making it now an SDU. The mail bag is labelled with the destination post code and so becomes a PDU, until it is combined with other bags in a crate, when it is now an SDU, and the crate is labelled with the region to which all the bags are to be sent, making the crate a PDU. When the crate reaches the destination matching its label, it is opened and the bags (SDUs) removed only to become PDUs when someone reads the code of the destination post office. The letters themselves are SDUs when the bags are opened but become PDUs when the address is read for final delivery. When the addressee finally opens the envelope, the top-level SDU, the letter itself, emerges.|$|R

The importance of high confidence in sender authenticity is especially obvious in a financial context. For example, suppose a bank's branch <b>office</b> <b>sends</b> instructions to the central office requesting a change in the balance of an account. If the central office is not convinced that such a message is truly sent from an authorized source, acting on such a request could be a grave mistake.|$|R

The proposed energy meter is smart enough also for billing and payment system. This meter can automatically disconnect the power line with the meter circuit in the absence of any person in the room or in the office and thus is helpful in power saving. The proposed meter uses a pre-paid smart card. For the first time use, the consumer has to pay an amount according to the maximum demand and the smart card will be recharged accordingly. Then when the recharge value will be equal to the stop value, a warning is to be provided by the smart meter and the card is to be recharged again. The card may be recharged through net-banking, Davit/Credit card like all other rechargeable card...|$|R

The procedures start from the sanction of the SME loan. The respective select potential enterprise, collect confidential information about the enterprise, open clients account is the respective bank where BRAC Bank has its own account, filled up CIB form and send it to the Asset Operation Department.
