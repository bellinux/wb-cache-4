5000|$|For <b>insulated</b> <b>cylinders,</b> a {{critical}} radius must be reached. Before the critical radius is reached any added insulation increases heat transfer. The convective thermal resistance is {{inversely proportional to}} the surface area and therefore the radius of the cylinder, while the thermal resistance of a cylindrical shell (the insulation layer) depends on the ratio between outside and inside radius, not on the radius itself. If the outside radius of a cylinder is increased by applying insulation, a fixed amount of conductive resistance (equal to ln(2)/(2πkL)) is added. However, at the same time, the convective resistance is reduced. This implies that adding insulation below a certain critical radius actually increases the heat transfer. For <b>insulated</b> <b>cylinders,</b> the critical radius is given by the equation ...|$|R
50|$|This {{equation}} {{shows that}} the critical radius depends only on the heat transfer coefficient and the thermal conductivity of the insulation. If the radius of the <b>insulated</b> <b>cylinder</b> is smaller than the critical radius for insulation, the addition of any amount of insulation will increase heat transfer.|$|R

50|$|The {{purposes}} of the sample assembly (Fig. 2) are to transmit hydrostatic pressure to the sample from the compressing piston, to provide controlled heating of the sample and to provide, via the capsule, a suitable volatile and oxygen fugacity environment for the experiment. Therefore, it includes a component {{for each of these}} purposes.The outer cylinder is a pressure transmitting, electrically <b>insulating</b> <b>cylinder</b> made from NaCl, talc, BaCO3, KBr, CaF2, or even borosilicate glass. The next components are, in order, an electrically <b>insulating</b> borosilicate glass <b>cylinder</b> and a graphite cylinder, which acts as the “furnace”. To locate the sample exactly in the centre of the furnace and to grip the thermocouple, a support rod usually made of crushable ceramics is used.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{based on the}} physics of heat transfer was developed to predict the components of heat loss from a homeothermic animal in relation to environmental conditions. The animal's trunk was treated as three concentric <b>insulating</b> <b>cylinders</b> around a heat-generating core, representing the body tissue, coat and surrounding environment. The model also accounted for heat losses from appendages. The model inputs were the hourly meteorological data, parameters and/or variables of animal physiology, and the thermoregulatory responses of different species to environmental conditions. The heat loss components were calculated by iteration of the heat balance equations, assuming steady heat flow. For illustration, the heat balance of a sheep outdoors is predicted from hourly weather data...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present a}} {{kinematic}} analysis and {{experimental study of}} DNA deformation in electric field gradients. Specifically, we investigate deformation near a large <b>insulating</b> <b>cylinder</b> with single molecule fluorescence videomicroscopy. Because the electrophoretic velocity field is a potential field, a kinematic analysis shows that local deformation of DNA in any electric field gradient is pure elongation, quantified by a strain rate and orthogonal axes of extension and compression. From the kinematics, we construct the electrophoretic Deborah number relating the competing effects of deformation {{in the field and}} the polymer elasticity. We report highly configuration-sensitive stretching {{at the front of the}} obstacle and affine compression in the region near the back stagnation point. Furthermore, the DNA also can extend both “pre-impact ” and “post-impact ” in this inhomogeneous extensional field. We find that field gradient induced deformation offers a simple way to extend and quickly compress DNA near surfaces in microdevices...|$|R

A metal stylus driven by a screw thread traveled {{across the surface of the}} cylinder as it turned, tracing out a path over the foil.

40|$|This paper treats a liquid-metal flow {{inside an}} {{electrically}} <b>insulating</b> <b>cylinder</b> with electrically conducting solids {{above and below}} the liquid region. There is a uniform axial magnetic field, and there is an electric current through the liquid and both solids. Since the lower liquid-solid interface is concave into the solid and since the liquid is a better electrical conductor than the adjacent solid, the electric current is locally concentrated near the centerline. The return to a uniform current distribution involves a radial electric current which interacts with the axial magnetic field to drive an azimuthal flow. The axial variation of the centrifugal force due to the azimuthal velocity drives a meridional circulation with radial and axial velocities. This problem models the effects of Peltier marking during the vertical Bridgman growth of semiconductor crystals with an externally applied magnetic field, where the meridional circulation due to the Peltier Current may produce important mixing in the molten semiconductor...|$|R

40|$|Volcanic ash {{is known}} to charge electrically, {{producing}} {{some of the most}} spectacular displays of lightning in nature. Here we investigate the electrical characteristics of ash from two different Icelandic volcanoes - Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 and Grímsvötn in 2011. Laboratory tests investigated the charge transferred to a conducting plate due to fall of volcanic ash through an <b>insulating</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Ash from the Eyjafjallajökull eruption was found to charge slightly positively, whilst Grímsvötn ash was substantially negatively charged. Measurement of the volumetric ratio of particle diameters showed the Eyjafjallajökull ash to have a bimodal distribution, and the Grímsvötn ash a monomodal distribution. Previous experiments with single-material particle systems show that smaller particles charge negatively and larger ones positively. Since charge is carried by individual particles, the charging is likely to be dominated by the number size distribution, therefore the large negative charge of the Grímsvötn ash is likely to be related to a large number of small particles within the number size distribution of the ash.

40|$|Abstract Background Classifying {{the types}} of {{extracellular}} potentials recorded when neural structures are activated {{is an important component}} in understanding nerve pathophysiology. Varying definitions and approaches to understanding the factors that influence the potentials recorded during neural activity have made this issue complex. Methods In this article, many of the factors which influence the distribution of electric potential produced by a traveling action potential are discussed from a theoretical standpoint with illustrative simulations. Results For an axon of arbitrary shape, it is shown that a quadrupolar potential is generated by action potentials traveling along a straight axon. However, a dipole moment is generated at any point where an axon bends or its diameter changes. Next, it is shown how asymmetric disturbances in the conductivity of the medium surrounding an axon produce dipolar potentials, even during propagation along a straight axon. Next, by studying the electric fields generated by a dipole source in an <b>insulating</b> <b>cylinder,</b> it is shown that in finite volume conductors, the extracellular potentials can be very different from those in infinite volume conductors. Finally, the effects of impulses propagating along axons with inhomogeneous cable properties are analyzed. Conclusion Because of the well-defined factors affecting extracellular potentials, the vague terms far-field and near-field potentials should be abandoned in favor of more accurate descriptions of the potentials. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{modeling}} of turbocharged diesel engine transient operation {{appeared in the}} early 1970 s {{and continues to be}} in the focal point of research due to the importance of transient response in the everyday operating conditions of engines. Simulations of various levels of complexity have been used so far to study engine performance during transients. On the other hand, the very important issue of exhaust emissions has been studied mainly on an experimental rather than simulation basis, owing to the high computational time required for the analysis of many cycles. The study of transient emissions from turbocharged diesel engines is extremely important for the manufacturers, since newly produced engines must meet the stringent regulations concerning exhaust emissions levels. In the present work, a comprehensive two-zone transient diesel combustion model is used for a parametric analysis of exhaust emissions prediction during load changes. The parameters studied are the load characteristics (magnitude and change schedule), the exhaust manifold volume, the geometric turbine inlet area as well as the exhaust valve opening timing. Also, the very interesting case of <b>insulated</b> <b>cylinder</b> walls is investigated. Analytical diagrams are provided for the time histories of nitric oxide (NO) and soot emissions, which depict the effect of each parameter considered. Moreover, the peculiarities of each case are discussed mainly in relation to turbocharger lag effects...|$|R

These new materials are designed to meet specific requirements and to make possible new applications in Pharmaceuticals design, heterogeneous catalysis, micro- and nano-particles with unique structures, <b>special</b> <b>insulating</b> materials, super capacitors and other special technical materials. Two distinct possibilities to apply supercritical fluids in processing of materials: synthesis of materials in supercritical fluid environment and/or further processing of already obtained materials with the help of supercritical fluids. By adjusting synthesis parameters the properties of supercritical fluids can be significantly altered which further results in the materials with different structures. Unique materials can be also obtained by conducting synthesis in quite specific environments like reversed micelles. This paper is mainly devoted to processing of previously synthesized materials which are further processed using supercritical fluids. Several new methods have been developed to produce micro- and nano-particles with the use of supercritical fluids.
