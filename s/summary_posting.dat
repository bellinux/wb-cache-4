40|$|A {{statistical}} <b>summary</b> <b>posted</b> on {{the internet}} by the Commission shows an expansion of ACP exports to the EU of 9 % in 2001 following a record 31 % rise in 2000. The memo expresses the view that this 'suggests the stagnation which characterised EU-ACP trade during the 1990 s may finally be coming to an end'. According to the Commission the increase in ACP exports were mainly of prepared foodstuffs, diamonds, aluminium, cocoa and oil. Five products (oil - 30 %, diamonds - 10 %, cocoa beans - 4 %, wood - 4 % and sugar cane - 3 %) account for 51 % of total ACP exports to the EU. Four ACP countries account for 40 % of total ACP exports to the EU. Finished products made up only 19 % of ACP exports to the EU, of which textiles and clothing and prepared foodstuffs {{were the most important}} categories. Accounting for 3. 4 % and 3 % respectively. Finished products accounted for 16 % of the increase in ACP exports in 2001. The EU accounts for 29 % of total ACP exports (compared to 33 % for the USA), and provides 29 % of all ACP imports (compared to 18 % for the USA). LDC exports to the EU increased by 15 % in 2001. Excluding oil the EU accounts for over 80 % of QUAD (EU, Japan, USA and Canada) imports from African ACP countries (compared to 10 % for the USA). EU exports to the ACP grew 4 % in 2001, following a rise of 21 % in 2000. The most important EU exports are machinery and mechanical equipment (25 %), vehicles, aircraft and other transport equipment (24 %) and chemical products (10 %). The most important ACP markets for EU exports are Nigeria (which takes 18 % of EU exports), Angola (5 %), Ivory Coast (5 %), Gabon (4 %), Cameroon (4 %), Dominican Republic (4 %) and Senegal (4 %). Comment: While the Euro value of ACP exports to the EU increased 43 % between 1999 and 2001 it should be borne in mind that the prices of the major ACP exports to the EU, such as oil, cocoa, coffee, tobacco and aluminium are all denominated in US$. With the Euro devaluing against the US$ by 24 % between 1999 and 2001, a major expansion of the Euro value of ACP exports would be expected simply on the basis of currency fluctuations. Earnings from ACP oil exports alone accounted for fully 60 % of the increase in total ACP exports to the EU between 1999 and 2001. Taking out this oil factor, ACP exports to the EU increased only 17 % between 1999 and 2001. More detailed analysis is required to ascertain whether the increase in the Euro value of ACP exports reflects any underlying structural changes in the ACPs trade with the EU.

40|$|The Bayesian {{approach}} to statistical inference in fundamentally probabilistic. Exploiting {{the internal consistency}} of the probability framework, the posterior distribution extracts the relevant information in the data, and provides a complete and coherent <b>summary</b> of <b>post</b> data uncertainty. However, summarising the posterior distribution often requires the calculation of awkward multidimensional integrals. A further complication with the Bayesian approach arises when the likelihood functions is unavailable. In this respect, promising advances have been made by theory of Approximate Bayesian Computations (ABC). This thesis focuses on computational methods for the approximation of posterior distributions, and it discusses six original contributions. The first contribution concerns the approximation of marginal posterior distributions for scalar parameters. By combining higher-order tail area approximation with the inverse transform sampling, we define the HOTA algorithm which draws independent random sample from the approximate marginal posterior. The second discusses the HOTA algorithm with pseudo-posterior distributions,, posterior distributions obtained by the combination of a pseudo-likelihood with a prior within Bayes' rule. The third contribution extends the use of tail-area approximations to contexts with multidimensional parameters, and proposes a method which gives approximate Bayesian credible regions with good sampling coverage properties. The forth presents an improved Laplace approximation which can be used for computing marginal likelihoods. The fifth contribution discusses a model-based procedure for choosing good summary statistics for ABC, by using composite score functions. Lastly, the sixth contribution discusses the choice of a default proposal distribution for ABC that is based on the notion of quasi-likelihood. ...|$|R

Seventy five Korean fourth graders from three classes were randomly assigned to the collaborative summarization, direct instruction, and control groups. During six sessions of 20 min instruction, the experimental students received instruction in summarization via two instructional approaches: collaborative summarization and direct instruction. The collaborative summarization model was developed as an alternative to direct instruction to incorporate scaffolding and active social interaction. Reading comprehension was assessed using three sentence verification tests. Summarization was examined in terms of identifying main ideas and including extraneous information. Writing quality was a combined rating of focus, support, and organization indices. The collaborative summarization group???s performance was significantly improved on identification of main ideas and writing quality in comparison to the control group, but the benefit of collaborative summarization was not reflected in reading comprehension. All three groups tended to produce shorter <b>summaries</b> on <b>posttest</b> and follow-up test than on the pretest, which led to inclusion of significantly fewer extraneous idea units on posttest and follow-up test than on the pretest.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{investigation of}} 132 kV field-aged ceramic post insulator, {{which has been}} in service 15 years old on a 132 kV in PMU Skudai substation. Insulators are devices which are used in electricity supply networks to support, separate or contain conductors at high voltage. Aging of ceramic and post insulator materials is reviewed mainly from the standpoint of their interfacial performance. Insulating materials can be divided into simple ceramics. Aging processes are complicated in general, and take place under simultaneous multiple stresses such as electrical, mechanical and environmental stresses. Contact angle measured insulation under consideration leads to the surface is approximately horizontal to the top surface. The sheds also aged differently around their circumference and this is reflected in discoloration differences on different sides of the insulator, in addition to hydrophobicity changes. Voltage breakdown measurements carried out in the laboratory are also presented. Material analysis shows oxidation of the surface. Ageing effects were different uniform for each shed, the greatest oxidation being on the top surfaces of the sheds on the west and east side. Microscopy was found to be the most useful and effective tools for analysis of these ceramic insulator. The measurements of the various parameters over the whole surface of the insulators are found to be consistent with each other and can be interpreted in terms of the chemistry of ageing and the longer term performance of the specific insulators in question. Two distinct types of ageing are identified. The role of solar radiation appears critical.

Ten FRC posts were modelled in order to give them a shape {{as close as possible to}} the anatomy of oval root canals. Starting from a preformed cylindrical fibre post 2. 5 mm in diameter, it was modelled in such a way as to passively occupy the entire post-space length, using a cast previously created as a guide. Microscopic analyses (optical stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscope) of the post surfaces revealed similar features in all three groups. All posts had regular surfaces after cutting with a diamond bur. Smear layer mainly attributable to the cutting procedures covered the cut surface of some specimens. In conclusion, modulation of a fibre post using a diamond-coated bur did not show a loss of integrity of the post. Key learning points Because of the importance of micromechanical retention, the surface integrity of fibre posts may be important for adhesion between post and composite resin. Modification of a fibre post using a diamond-coated bur did not damage the surface integrity of the posts. Fibre posts can be ground to a different shape without losing their surface integrity, resulting in posts with a surface that is not visibly different from unmodified commercially available fibre posts...|$|R

40|$|Approximately 8. 4 % or 6. 4 million {{children}} are diagnosed with asthma in the United States. Asthma is a chronic and life threatening disease that cannot be cured but only managed. Asthma {{is also one}} of the most expensive conditions to manage, requiring direct health care services if not adequately controlled. Asthma symptoms and exacerbations are also the number one reason for school absences among children. The PICOT question that guided the review of the literature to answer the clinical question was: In children with asthma, how does a school-based self-management asthma education program compared to standard management affect school absences and unscheduled asthma health care visits over a 12 -month period? The purpose of this evidenced-based practice project was to provide asthma education at school for children with asthma to improve asthma self-management skills and decrease asthma symptoms that lead to emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and school absences. Students enrolled in grades two through five identified with either parent reported or physician diagnosed asthma were asked by the school nurse to participate in the Open Airways for Schools asthma education program held at school once per week for five weeks taught by trained student nurses. Parents signed a consent form for the child to participate in the Open Airway for Schools program and were asked to complete a questionnaire about their child’s asthma. Childhood Asthma Control Tests (cACT) were administered to students and parents at the start of the program and then 4 weeks after the program. Students with rescue inhalers at school completed a Rescue Inhaler Skills Checklist (RISC) before the inhaler lesson in the Open Airways for Schools program and 4 weeks after the program was finished. School nurses and student nurses followed up with and encouraged students, parents, and outside health care providers to provide rescue inhalers and asthma action plans. An ANOVA was conducted on the cACT pre and <b>post</b> <b>summary</b> mean scores revealed no significant difference, F(1, 36) = 1. 34, p = 0. 26; however, an ANOVA performed on the RISC pre and <b>post</b> <b>summary</b> mean scores revealed a significant difference, F(1, 27) = 7. 88, p = 0. 009. Pre and <b>post</b> cACT <b>summary</b> mean scores at the individual school level suggested improvement among three of the seven schools; while, four of the seven schools noted improvement between the pre and <b>post</b> RISC <b>summary</b> mean scores. An ANCOVA further analyzed the covariates of grade, school, sex, ethnicity and number of sessions attended for cACT and RISC scores; significance was found in the difference of the cACT scores, F(1, 31) = 4. 910, p = 0. 034; but the RISC scores found no difference, F(1, 22) =. 0007, p = 0. 933 with all covariates; at the individual school level significance was found, F(1, 26) = 6. 82, p= 0. 016. School absenteeism increased during the intervention, and emergency department visits and hospital admissions were insignificant. Limited time frame for tracking outcome data related to absences, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions, low return rates on Childhood Asthma Control Tests and rescue inhalers were limiting factors of this project. Nevertheless, self-management asthma education programs have the potential to improve asthma symptoms that impact everyday life.

"The April 20, 2010, {{explosion and}} collapse of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in the release of millions of barrels of oil into Gulf waters. The response to this disaster involved the efforts {{of tens of thousands of}} workers in a variety of capacities across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas, and in the Gulf of Mexico itself. The diverse work included oil and tar ball removal from beaches, oil skimming and booming near shores, burning of surface oil near the source of the oil release, surface application of dispersant by vessels and aircraft, and containment and recovery work on vessels at the release site. The nature of these activities raised concerns about potential occupational exposures to chemical and physical hazards and mental stressors. The Deepwater Horizon oil release was an unprecedented event in the United States in many respects, requiring response work across a vast area of multiple jurisdictions. The type, location, and quantities of oil released; the types and quantities of dispersant used; and climatic and geographical conditions differentiate this release from past oil spills. On May 28, 2010, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) received a request for a health hazard evaluation (HHE) from BP management concerning health effects experienced by responders to the oil release. The request was prompted by the May 26, 2010, hospitalization of seven fishermen who were working in BP's Vessels of Opportunity (VoO) program in the Gulf of Mexico. The fishermen had been hospitalized for symptoms that were initially believed to be related to exposures experienced during their response activities, particularly booming and skimming oil. In response to this request, we began an investigation on June 2, 2010, with an opening meeting held at the BP Operations Center in Houma, Louisiana. In attendance were representatives from NIOSH, BP, the Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health (CTEH), O'Brien's Response Management, the U. S. Coast Guard (USCG), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Objectives of this opening meeting were to discuss the initial investigations conducted by CTEH and OSHA into the events surrounding the hospitalization of the fishermen and to plan the NIOSH investigation. These plans included interviews, health symptom surveys, and on-site industrial hygiene assessments of response work activities similar to those performed by the fishermen. As the plans were developing, BP requested that we expand the scope of the HHE to include all major offshore response activities. In addition to oil booming and skimming conducted by workers on VoO vessels, these activities included aerial and vessel-based dispersant releases, in-situ surface oil burning, containment and recovery work at the oil source, and other related offshore oil removal activities. In the weeks that followed, teams of NIOSH industrial hygienists, medical officers, and other occupational health specialists conducted on-site investigations at locations throughout the Gulf region to collect quantitative and qualitative data on potential worker exposures, health symptoms, work practices and procedures, and work organization. On June 22, 2010, NIOSH received a request from BP for a second HHE to investigate potential hazards associated with onshore response work activities. In response to this request, teams of NIOSH personnel evaluated practices and procedures including wildlife cleanup operations, beach cleanup operations, and decontamination and waste management activities throughout the states of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. In contrast to the offshore evaluations, which relied on traditional industrial hygiene exposure assessment methodologies and quantitative exposure monitoring to identify potential hazards, the onshore assessment relied on qualitative assessment techniques, including the use of professional judgment and expertise during observations of onshore work activities. Health symptom surveys, however, were similar to those used for the offshore evaluations. The goals of the NIOSH HHE assessments were to describe acute health effects, evaluate occupational exposures in qualitative or quantitative assessments, and generate hypotheses regarding symptoms potentially related to work activities. These assessments were not intended to describe or investigate potential long-term or chronic health effects. The results of these investigations were reported in a series of nine interim reports and report <b>summaries</b> <b>posted</b> on the NIOSH website. The full reports were distributed electronically to key contacts for each work activity evaluated. Included in the reports were conclusions regarding the extent of hazards and exposures identified as well as recommendations for improving workplace conditions. Furthermore, all exposure and health symptom survey data were compiled in electronic spreadsheets and posted on the NIOSH website. This information can be accessed at [URL] Additional information about other components of the NIOSH Deepwater Horizon response activities outside of the HHE investigation, including response worker rostering efforts, analyses of injury and illness data, and guidance and educational materials developed for the response can be found on the NIOSH website at [URL]. This final report summarizes our evaluations made during the course of the offshore and onshore HHE investigations and describes the conditions and characteristics encountered during the event.

40|$|Since its {{inception}} in 1998, the Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP) has funded over 350 projects. The Joint Fire Science Program has long recognized that the investments made in wildland fire science need {{to be accompanied by}} an emphasis on science interpretation and delivery. Program success is ultimately measured by how well information from research efforts is being conveyed to resource managers and end users, and whether this information is improving management decisions. This project introduced a conceptual model for an adaptive process to improve the delivery of scientific information. We developed this process through these steps: 1. Creating a clear understanding of the existing set of knowledge, methods, and tools 2. Assessing whether these are useful and who needs them 3. Determining which scientists and managers will be helpful in the delivery process and which will avoid or resist it 4. Developing a plan to demonstrate a variety of science delivery techniques. The overall goal was to promote organizational change through a two-way transfer of information between researchers and those who put new knowledge, methods, and tools into use. To accomplish this goal, the study undertook four distinct projects. The first task was to create summaries of each JFSP-funded project. Each one presented a manager’s perspective of the project and the applicability of the research. A total of 138 were drafted and sent out to the Principal Investigators for review. The final <b>summaries</b> have been <b>posted</b> to the Wildland Fire – Lessons Learned Center website. The next task involved a survey of land managers from the various agencies that support JFSP, asking for their perspectives on the program and the effectiveness of current science delivery mechanisms. The third task was a survey of Principal Investigators from JFSP asking for their perspectives on effective science delivery techniques. We also conducted an evaluation of synthesis techniques and evaluated the proof of concept in relation to the our analysis of the completed JFSP studie...|$|R
40|$|The Petroleum Technology Transfer Council (PTTC) {{continued}} pursuing {{its mission}} of assisting U. S. independent {{oil and gas}} producers to make timely, informed technology decisions. Functioning as a cohesive national organization, PTTC has active grassroots programs through its 10 Regional Lead Organizations (RLOs) and 3 Satellite Offices that encompass all of the oil- and natural gas-producing regions in the U. S. Active volunteer leadership from the Board and regional Producer Advisory Groups keeps activities focused on producer's needs. Technical expertise and personal networks of national and regional staff enable PTTC to deliver focused, technology-related information {{in a manner that}} is cost and time effective for independents. The organization effectively combines federal funding through the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy with matching state and industry funding, forming a unique partnership. This final report summarizes PTTC's accomplishments. In this final fiscal year of the contract, activities exceeded prior annual activity levels by significant percentages. Strategic planning implemented during the year is focusing PTTC's attention on changes that will bear fruit in the future. Networking and connections are increasing PTTC's sphere of influence with both producers and the service sector. PTTC's reputation for unbiased bottom-line information stimulates cooperative ventures. In FY 03 PTTC's regions held 169 workshops, drawing 8, 616 attendees. There were nearly 25, 000 reported contacts. This represents a 38 % increase in attendance and 34 % increase in contacts as compared to FY 02 activity. Repeat attendance at regional workshops, a measure of customer satisfaction and value received, remained strong at 50 %. 39 % of participants in regional workshops respond ''Yes'' on feedback forms when asked if they are applying technologies based on knowledge gained through PTTC. This feedback confirms that producers are taking action with the information they receive. RLO Directors captured examples demonstrating how PTTC activities influenced industry activity. Additional follow-up in all regions explored industry's awareness of PTTC and the services it provides. PTTC publishes monthly case studies in the ''Petroleum Technology Digest in World Oil'' and monthly Tech Connections columns in the ''American Oil and Gas Reporter''. Email Tech Alerts are utilized to notify the O&G community of DOE solicitations and demonstration results, PTTC key technical information and meetings, as well as industry highlights. Workshop <b>summaries</b> are <b>posted</b> online at www. pttc. org. PTTC maintains an active exhibit schedule at national industry events. The national communications effort continues to expand the audience PTTC reaches. The network of national and regional websites has proven effective for conveying technology-related information and facilitating user's access to basic oil and gas data, which supplement regional and national newsletters. The regions frequently work with professional societies and producer associations in co-sponsored events and there is a conscious effort to incorporate findings from DOE-supported research, development and demonstration (RD&D) projects within events. The level of software training varies by region, with the Rocky Mountain Region taking the lead. Where appropriate, regions develop information products that provide a service to industry and, in some cases, generate moderate revenues. Data access is an on-going industry priority, so all regions work to facilitate access to public source databases. Various outreach programs also emanate from the resource centers, including targeted visits to producers...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{hypertrophy}} {{is referred}} to a physiological and pathological increase in the heart's muscle mass and organ size. A myocardial infarction (MI) results in a pathological hypertrophy of the remaining cardiomyocytes {{to compensate for the}} damaged myocardium and pressure overload. Initially, cardiomyocytes alter their shape and extracellular matrix is remodelled to preserve cardiac function and normalizing systolic wall stress. After exceeding the compensatory ability of the heart remodelling leads to maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy which is accompanied by fibrosis of the myocardium. Therefore, basic knowledge of relevant genes which govern cardiac remodelling in pathological hypertrophy is of high clinical relevance. Recently, Brancaccio et al. identified melusin as a promising candidate gene for a modulator of cardiac hypertrophy and demonstrated a potential role of melusin for cardioprotection during chronic pressure overload. This work aims at analysing the functional relevance of melusin for cardiac hypertrophic remodelling after experimental induction of myocardial infarction. Therefore, the present study was performed using a mouse model of myocardial infarction (left coronary artery ligation) to induce left ventricular hypertrophy. First, the maladaptive cardiac response post MI was evaluated by morphological, biochemical and molecular analysis in melusin overexpressing transgenic mice (Mel-TG) in comparison to wild type mice (WT). Second, since sex-differences concerning this matter have not been investigated before, remodelling of the extracellular matrix during pathological hypertrophy was studied sex-specific for male and female mice. In <b>summary</b> 14 days <b>post</b> MI data showed that Mel-TG mice have a lower mortality rate in comparison to WT mice. Furthermore, phenotypical studies show that melusin overexpressing mice exhibit a smaller cardiac weight and a reduced left ventricular hypertrophic remodelling. Gene expression analysis of relevant target genes of extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation show differences in Mel-TG as compared to WT mice. Here, alterations in gene expression were observed for stress factors such as NPPA and regulators of the ECM homeostasis such as MMP 2, TIMP- 2 and TIMP- 3. Analysis of phenotypical cardiac parameters and gene expression levels revealed strong inverse correlation between NPPA and fractional shortening. Finally histological staining demonstrated that fibrosis is reduced in melusin overexpressing mice as compared to wild type mice indicating together with the expression data a cardioprotective function. Gender-specific analysis identified a higher mortality rate for males post MI and showed phenotypical differences for functional parameters of the heart between male and female mice. However, neither gender-specific differences in gene expression nor in fibrosis score were detected...|$|R
