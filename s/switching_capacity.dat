50|$|The term at wire speed, or the {{adjective}} wire speed, describes any computer system or hardware device that {{is able to}} achieve a throughput equal to the maximum throughput of the communication standard. This requires that the CPU capacity, bus capacity, network <b>switching</b> <b>capacity,</b> etc., be sufficient.

Data encryption and decryption and hardware emulation are software functions that might run at wire speed (or close to it) when embedded in a microchip.|$|E
50|$|Both these {{functions}} are {{extremely important to}} network operators. If insufficient capability is deployed at a node (for example, if a backbone router has 1 gigabit/sec of <b>switching</b> <b>capacity</b> and more than this is offered) then the risk of equipment failure increases, and customers experience poor service. However, if the network is overprovisioned the cost in equipment can be high. Most providers therefore seek to maximise the effect of their spending by maintaining an unused overhead capacity for growth, and expanding key nodes to relieve problem areas. Identification of these areas is accomplished by network dimensioning.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Tremendous {{increase}} of Internet traffic demands high speed, large <b>capacity</b> IP <b>switch</b> routers. The introduction of multi-server switch architectures {{not only makes}} it possible to scale to larger <b>switch</b> <b>capacities,</b> but also imposes special requirements on scheduling algorithms running in the central scheduler. In this paper, we model the multi-server switch scheduling problem as a maximum bipartite K-matching problem. We generalize iSLIP and DRR to multi-server switch architectures and propose two distributed scheduling algorithms kDRR RGA and kDRR RG for finding maximal K-matchings. Through simulations, we show that both algorithms achieve comparable performance with high throughput under uniform traffic. Using programmable k-selectors, kDRR RGA and kDRR RG are ready to be implemented at high speed. Key words: Multi-server switch architectures, kDRR scheduling algorithms, K-matching, programmable k-selectors. ...|$|R
