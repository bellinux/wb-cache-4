5|$|The {{emission}} {{of dust and}} particles could have covered the entire <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would {{have led to a}} sudden greenhouse effect. Over a longer period, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity (NPP) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E
5|$|A tornado is a violently {{rotating}} {{column of}} air {{that is in}} contact with both the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, {{the base of a}} cumulus cloud. Also referred to as twisters, a collequial term in America, or cyclones, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology, in a wider sense, to name any closed low-pressure circulation.|$|E
5|$|Rock {{units are}} first emplaced either by {{deposition}} {{onto the surface}} or intrude into the overlying rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{came at a}} {{time when}} Japan was undergoing a transformation into a more industrial nation and while advancing its scientific understanding in many fields. Damage from the event was widespread and the loss of life was significant. The many kilometers of visible fault breaks on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> presented scientists with opportunities for field investigations that ultimately led to an improved understanding of the fault scarps that earthquakes often generate.|$|E
5|$|The heat {{needed for}} geyser {{formation}} comes from magma {{that needs to}} be near the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b> The fact that geysers need heat much higher than normally found near the earth's surface is the reason they are associated with volcanoes or volcanic areas. The pressures encountered at the areas where the water is heated make the boiling point of the water much higher than at normal atmospheric pressures.|$|E

5|$|Many Massachusetts {{residents}} of the time perceived the quake as punishment from God for immoral behavior. In {{the days after the}} earthquake, special prayer services were held and civic authorities declared fast days. A number of sermons and other writings were published as a consequence, including Jeremiah Newland's Verses Occasioned by the Earthquakes in the Month of November, 1755 and Thomas Prince's Earthquakes the Works of God and Tokens of his Just Displeasure. Not all explanations of the event were theological; John Winthrop, a Harvard professor, proposed an alternate explanation having to do with heat and chemical vapors inside the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Undertale is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} created by American indie developer and composer Toby Fox. In the game, players control a human {{child who has}} fallen into the Underground, a large, secluded region underneath the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> separated by a magic barrier. The player meets various monsters during a quest {{to return to the}} surface, mainly through the combat system; the player navigates through mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent, and can opt to pacify or subdue monsters in order to spare them instead of murdering them. These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story changing based on outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{boundary}} event was severe, there was significant {{variability in the}} rate of extinction between and within different clades. Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the solar energy reaching the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups. Omnivores, insectivores, and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. No purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving mammals and birds fed on insects, worms, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus (non-living organic material).|$|E
50|$|Wind-generated {{gravity waves}} on <b>the</b> free <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> ponds, lakes, seas and oceans have {{a period of}} between 0.3 and 30 seconds (3 Hz to 0.03 Hz). Shorter waves are also {{affected}} by surface tension and are called gravity-capillary waves and (if hardly influenced by gravity) capillary waves. Alternatively, so-called infragravity waves, which are due to subharmonic nonlinear wave interaction with the wind waves, have periods longer than the accompanying wind-generated waves.|$|R

5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E
5|$|Metallic or native iron {{is rarely}} {{found on the}} <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are {{pervasive}} and represent the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% {{of the mass of}} the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3). Many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and pentlandite.|$|E
5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance below the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b> The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend {{the shores of the}} lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E

50|$|A lunar dome {{is a type}} of {{shield volcano}} that is found on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> Moon. They are {{typically}} formed by highly viscous, possibly silica-rich lava, erupting from localized vents followed by relatively slow cooling. Lunar domes are wide, rounded, circular features with a gentle slope rising in elevation a few hundred meters to the midpoint. They are typically 8-12 km in diameter, but can be up to 20 km across. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domes contain a small craterlet at the peak.|$|R
50|$|The Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) is a {{research}} program <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World Climate Research Programme intended to observe, comprehend and model <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> water cycle. <b>The</b> experiment also observes how much energy <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> receives, studies {{how much of that}} energy reaches <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> and how that energy is transformed. Sunlight's energy evaporates water to produce clouds and rain, and dries out land masses after rain. Rain that falls on land becomes the water budget which can be used by people for agricultural and other processes.|$|R
5|$|Near the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by {{the field of}} a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of}} the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the Sun's December {{solstice}} position (in {{the northern}} hemisphere, {{the lowest point}} on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the Milky Way. Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth)</b> to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.|$|E
