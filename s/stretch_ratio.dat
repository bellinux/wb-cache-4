In {{order to}} {{understand}} the influence of stretching on the nanotribological properties of human hair, the European hair with <b>stretching</b> <b>ratios</b> at 20, 40, 60 and 80 % were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM).

When the <b>stretching</b> <b>ratio</b> is 80 %, the European hair has the highest coefficient of friction. The reason is that cuticle damages lead to the local ratchet and collision between AFM tip and the sample obviously increased.

Simulation model based on Maxwell theory was built up to investigate the ejection and motion behaviors of multi charged jets. The charge Coulomb repulsive force among adjacent jet was introduced into the simulation model, which enhanced the instability motion and promoted the stretching process of charged jets. The <b>stretching</b> <b>ratio</b> of charged jet increased with the increasing of injection distance, applied voltage, distance between spinneret and collector. But <b>stretching</b> <b>ratio</b> of charged jet decreased with the increasing of distance between charged jets. <b>Stretching</b> <b>ratio</b> in multi-jet electrospinning was larger than that in single-jet electrospinning. The maximal <b>stretching</b> <b>ratio</b> of charged jet was larger than 9000 in the nine jets electrospinning mode. This work provided a good method to investigate the controlling technology of multi-jet electrospinning. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the dynamic {{analysis}} of the linear vibration response of a pre-stretched circular hyper elastic membrane with large deformation. Geometrical as well as material nonlinearity come together due to finite deformations and a hyper elastic constitutive relationship. The membrane material {{is assumed to be}} isotropic, homogeneous, and Neo-Hookean. A commercial finite element code ANSYS is used to perform the prestressed modal analysis as well as hyper elastic material curve fitting. The results are compared to the analytical solutions obtained from literature. The effect of <b>stretching</b> <b>ratio</b> and membrane thickness on the mode frequencies, shapes and order is studied. The increase in <b>stretching</b> <b>ratio</b> increases the concentration of in plane modes in the lower frequencies, and also decreases the frequency of the same. The out of plane modes are dominant in the lower frequencies at lower <b>stretch</b> <b>ratios</b> due to the predominance bending stiffness compared to membrane stiffness.

40|$|A comb-like {{liquid crystal}} polymer is {{stretched}} and quenched after a certain time in the nematic phase. The conformation of the deformed chain is determined using small angle neutron scattering (SANS) {{as a function of}} the temperature of <b>stretching,</b> the <b>stretching</b> <b>ratio</b> and the duration of the relaxation. The scattering data are well fitted to junction affine and phantom network models. Some data are even well fitted by a totally affine model that we call “ pseudo affine ” because the only parameter, the <b>stretching</b> <b>ratio,</b> is found to be well below the macroscopic <b>stretching</b> <b>ratio.</b> The latter result, never encountered with amorphous polymers, is attributed to the cooperative effects of the nematic phase. We also note that the form factors of the chain in the underformed sample remain similar in the isotropic, nematic and glassy state; they correspond to a Gaussian chain. The same samples were studied by wide angle X-ray scattering. On one hand, the orientation of the mesogenic groups is found to be parallel or perpendicular to the stretching direction depending on the stretching temperature. This result is discussed {{as a function of the}} presence of smectic fluctuations.

The half-space {{have been subjected to}} finite pure homogeneous predeformations, with distinct <b>stretch</b> <b>ratios</b> but common principal axes, and such that the interface is a common principal plane of strain. Constant loads are applied at infinity to maintain the deformations and the influence of these loads on the propagation of small-amplitude interface (Stoneley) waves is examined. In particular, the secular equation is found and necessary and sufficient conditions to be satisfied by the <b>stretch</b> <b>ratios</b> to ensure the existence of such waves are given. As the loads vary, the Stoneley wave speed varies accordingly: the upper bound is the "limiting speed" (given explicitly), beyond which the wave amplitude cannot decay away from the interface; the lower bound is zero, where the interface might become unstable. The treatment parallels the one followed for the incompressible case and the differences due to the Bell constraint are highlighted. Finally, the analysis is specialized to specific strain energy densities and to the case where the bimaterial is uniformly deformed (that is when the <b>stretch</b> <b>ratios</b> for the upper half-space are equal to those for the lower half-space.)

The slow ramp is only at 1/100. The slow ramp will cross zero at some time during the clock period. When the ramp crosses zero, the fast ramp is turned on again to measure the crossing time (tresidual). Consequently, the time can be determined to 1 part in 10,000.|$|E
