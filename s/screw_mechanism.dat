2500|$|The {{carriage}} {{was first}} put into operational {{use in the}} afternoon of 15 April 1782, when Koehler demonstrated it to the Governor of Gibraltar, General George Augustus Eliott, and other officers of the garrison. The target chosen was San Carlos Battery, a Spanish position some [...] distant in the Lines of Contravallation. Drinkwater recorded that out of thirty rounds fired, twenty-eight hit the target. Koehler's carriage became a key advantage for the defenders of Gibraltar, contributing to the accuracy and speed of the British artillery, {{and became one of}} the most famous and successful examples of a special gun carriage. However, it had a significant flaw in that the angle of depression could only be adjusted in a number of large 'steps', making it difficult to aim at certain angles. This was resolved by an 1870s update to the design which saw the addition of a large wheel at the back, connected to a <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which enabled fine tuning of the angle.|$|E
2500|$|The endpin or spike {{is made of}} wood, {{metal or}} rigid carbon fibre and {{supports}} the cello in playing position. The endpin can be retracted into the hollow body of the instrument when the cello is being transported in its case. This makes the cello easier to move about. When the performer wishes to play the cello, the endpin is pulled out to lengthen it. The endpin is locked into the player's preferred length with a <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The adjustable nature of endpins enables performers of different ages and body sizes to adjust the endpin length to suit them. [...] In the Baroque period the cello was held between the calves, as there was no endpin at that time. The endpin was [...] "introduced by Adrien Servais [...] 1845 to give the instrument greater stability". Modern endpins are retractable and adjustable; older ones were removed when not in use. (The word [...] "endpin" [...] sometimes also refers to the button of wood located at this place in all instruments in the violin family, but this is usually called [...] "tailpin".) The sharp tip of the cello's endpin is sometimes capped with a rubber tip that protects the tip from dulling and prevents the cello from slipping on the floor. Many cellists use a rubber pad with a metal cup to keep the tip from slipping on the floor. A number of accessories to keep the endpin from slipping; these include ropes which attach to the chair leg and other devices.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>screw</b> is a <b>mechanism</b> that {{converts}} rotational motion to linear motion, and a torque (rotational force) to a linear force. [...] It {{is one of}} the six classical simple machines. The most common form consists of a cylindrical shaft with helical grooves or ridges called threads around the outside. [...] The screw passes through a hole in another object or medium, with threads {{on the inside of the}} hole that mesh with the screw's threads. When the shaft of the screw is rotated relative to the stationary threads, the screw moves along its axis relative to the medium surrounding it; for example rotating a wood screw forces it into wood. In <b>screw</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> either the <b>screw</b> shaft can rotate through a threaded hole in a stationary object, or a threaded collar such as a nut can rotate around a stationary screw shaft. [...] Geometrically, a screw can be viewed as a narrow inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.|$|R

40|$|Acetabular {{reinforcement}} devices (ARDs) {{are frequently}} used as load-sharing devices to allow allograft incorporation in revision hip arthroplasty with massive acetabular bone loss. The {{key to a}} successful reconstruction is robust fixation of the device to the host acetabulum. Interlocking fixation is expected to improve the initial stability of the postoperative construct. However, all commercially available ARDs are designed with non-locking fixation. This study investigates the efficacy of standard ARDs modified with locking <b>screw</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for improving stability in acetabular reconstruction. Three types of ARDs were examined to evaluate the postoperative compression and angular stability: i) standard commercial ARDs, ii) standard ARDs modified with monoaxial and iii) standard ARDs modified with polyaxial locking <b>screw</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> All ARDs were implanted into osteomized synthetic pelvis with pelvic discontinuity. Axial compression and torsion tests were then performed using a servohydraulic material testing machine that measured load (angle) versus displacement (torque). Initial stability was compared among the groups. Equipping ARDs with interlocking mechanisms effectively improved the initial stability at the device/bone interface compared to standard non-locked ARDs. In both compression and torsion experiments, the monoaxial interlocking construct demonstrated the highest construct stiffness (672. 6 Â± 84. 1 N/mm in compression and 13. 3 Â± 1. 0 N Â· m/degree in torsion), whereas the non-locked construct had the lowest construct stiffness (381. 4 Â± 117. 2 N/mm in compression and 6. 9 Â± 2. 1 N Â· m/degree in torsion) (P < 0. 05). Our study demonstrates the potential benefit of adding a locking mechanism to an ARD. Polyaxial ARDs provide the surgeon with more flexibility in placing the screws {{at the cost of}} reduced mechanical performance. This in vitro study provides a preliminary evaluation of biomechanical performance for ARDs with or without interlocking mechanisms, actual clinical trial deserves to be further investigated in future studies...|$|R

40|$|Ball <b>screw</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (BSM) and {{planetary}} roller <b>screw</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (PRSM) belong to promising energy-saving mechanisms converting rotary motion into linear motion. To calculate and design these mechanisms the static and dynamic load capacities are used. In case a standard {{size of the}} mechanism to be designed is available in manufacturerâs catalog, the specified load capacities can be taken from the catalog, and if not, then the static load for the mechanism being designed can be calculated. To determine the dynamic load capacity, long-term and costly experimental studies are to be conducted. Therefore, the crucial task is to forecast the BSM and PRSM dynamic load capacity and, further, the service life of these mechanisms. As follows from the analysis of information provided in manufacturersâ catalogs, there were established correlative relationships of static and dynamic load capacities for BSM and PRSM with the parameters determining their standard sizes. Using these relationships and methods of power regression enable us to obtain empirical dependences linking the factor equal to the ratio of static load capacity to dynamic load capacity with parameters defining standard sizes of the mechanisms. To predict BSM and PRSM service lives the said ratio is calculated using the empirical dependence, static load capacity of the mechanism being designed is determined by means of calculation using known procedures, and then dynamic load capacity is determined as the quotient of static load capacity division by the said factor. Then, having determined the equivalent load acting on the mechanism being designed the service life value is predicted based on known procedures. The developed procedure for predicting dynamic load capacity and service life {{can be used for}} calculation of newly developed BSM and PRSM designs when determining reasonable parameters of these mechanisms and their parts. The article cites an example of forecasting PRSM service life with reasoned selection of the most important parameters of its parts, by means of which a substantial economic effect can be obtained...|$|R
