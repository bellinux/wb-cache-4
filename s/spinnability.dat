Wheat gluten {{is one of the}} raw materials deserving special attention in this respect. Many different gluten based materials have been developed in the last years, ranging from rubberlike to very brittle materials. In order to expand the product possibilities, different processing routes have also been explored. In this thesis, the focus is on spinning with the aim of producing gluten based fibers. To produce these fibers, a wet spinline was built. To test and validate this spinline, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was used. The rheological behavior of aqueous PVA solutions with different degree of hydrolysis, molecular weight and concentration was determined and correlated with their <b>spinnability.</b> It was concluded the <b>spinnability</b> of PVA solutions is highly dependent on the degree of hydrolysis of the used PVA. To investigate the <b>spinnability</b> of aqueous solutions of reduced gliadin containing urea, the rheological characteristics have been determined, while varying the ureum and gliadin concentration. Aqueous urea solution exhibit a time dependent rheology, which can be changed by applying different levels of shear. In a last step, composites based on flax fibers and a gluten matrix were produced. In the production of the prepregs, a solvent was used to extract the gluten proteins. This solvent composition was optimized for extractability and mechanical properties of the resulting composite. Adding a reducing agent greatly improved the extractability of wheat gluten proteins. The expensive dithiothreitol has more effect than the cheap, but less efficient sodium sulfite. In longitudinal direction the mechanical properties of the resulting composite remain the same, whereas they get better in the transverse direction. The extractability can also be increased by adding a base. The mechanical properties in transverse direction decreased dramatically, possibly due to too severe processing conditions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop new}} {{criteria}} that describe the minimum concentration limits controlling the <b>spinnability</b> of dilute and semi-dilute flexible polymer solutions with {{high molecular weight}} and varying polydispersity. By asserting that the finite and bounded extensional viscosity of the solution is the key material property determining the stability of a filament during spinning, we propose a new scaling relating the minimum necessary concentration of a polymer c[subscript spin] to its molecular weight M {{and the quality of}} the solvent (through the excluded volume exponent ν) of the form c[subscript spin]∼M−(ν+ 1). This new scaling differs from the classical interpretation of the coil overlap concentration c[superscript ∗] or entanglement concentration c[subscript e] as the minimum concentration required to increase the viscosity of the spinning dope, and rationalizes the surprising <b>spinnability</b> of high molecular weight polymers at concentrations much lower than c[subscript e]. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of an extensibility average molecular weight M[subscript L] as the appropriate average for the description of polydisperse solutions undergoing an extension-dominated spinning process. In particular it is shown that this extensibility average measure, and thus the solution <b>spinnability,</b> is primarily determined by the extensibility of the highest molecular weight fractions. For highly polydisperse systems this leads to an effective lowering of the minimum required concentration for successful fibre spinning (in comparison to narrowly distributed polymer solutions of similar weight average molecular weights). These predictions are validated with experimental observations of the electrospinnablity of mono- and polydisperse poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) solutions as well as a model bimodal blend, and through comparison to published literature data on the minimum spinnable polymer concentration for a variety of flexible long chain polymers over a range of molecular weights.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} the influence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the <b>spinnability,</b> morphology and wetting properties of electrospun polylactic acid (PLA) non-woven mats. PLA was electrospun from a chloroform solution (4. 7 % g/g) and a filament and beads morphology was obtained, the filaments having an average diameter of 1. 25 μm. Interestingly, water contact angle measurements showed a contact angle of θ = 81 °, an improvement relative to as-cast film which exhibited a contact angle of θ = 54 °. When AgNP, of ca. 12 nm size, were incorporated at 1 % g/g relative to PLA weight, to the 4. 7 % PLA-chloroform solution, and electrospun, the filaments diameter was greatly reduced to an average of 0. 65 μm, and the density of polymer beads was also reduced. It is believed that the electric conductivity of silver enhanced the <b>spinnability</b> of the polymer solution. Strikingly, water contact angle measurements showed that the PLA/AgNP mats exhibited an angle as high θ = 134 °. Increasing the solution concentration to 6. 7 % g/g still produced a beads-and-filament morphology, but with larger filament diameters, probably due to an increase in solution viscosity. When AgNP were added (again at 1 % g/g relative to PLA weight), the occurrence of beads diminished and the average filament diameter decreased confirming the enhancement in <b>spinnability</b> by the AgNPs. Moreover, contact angles remained above 110 ° suggesting that the overall morphology is key to PLA's mats hydrophobic behavior and not only filament diameter. Finally, the non-woven mats were rather amorphous, as revealed by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray scattering, due presumably to the quenching process associated with the electrospinning process. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

40|$|Foamed cable insulations and {{conductive}} polymer composite fibres are two applications in polymer processing where the electrical properties of a material may be altered significantly during processing. Their common denominator {{is that the}} outcome depends {{to a large degree}} on the flow behaviour of the polymer melt, in particular the melt extensional properties. In communication cables, the speed of propagation can be increased and the power lost in the transmission line decreased by foaming the cable insulation. Measurements on foamed polyethylene at 34 kHz and 11. 2 GHz, using a dielectric spectrometer and a cavity resonance technique respectively, showed that the dielectric constant and the dielectric loss factor decreased with increasing porosity. However, the incorporation of a blowing agent significantly increased the dielectric loss factor. Comparing the loss factors measured at 1. 8 GHz using a split-post dielectric resonator of 8 commercial high density polyethylene grades with the presence of specific molecular groups showed correlations between low dielectric losses and low amounts of carbonyl and trans-vinylene groups. Increasing the conductivity of polymer composite textile fibres may extend their use in various applications like heating, sensing and shielding. Several combinations of conductive fillers and polymers were prepared by melt mixing in a mixing chamber. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) and carbon black (CB) were used as conductive fillers. Conductivity was measured and the melt <b>spinnability</b> was evaluated with a capillary viscometer. <b>Spinnability</b> was closely related to melt elasticity and yield stress phenomena which in turn could be related to the formation of a filler network. The type of MWNT and method of their dispersion had a large influence on melt elasticity and conductivity. Elongation during melt spinning and drawing significantly decreased fiber conductivity. This effect was more pronounced for MWNT than for CB. However, conductivity lost due to elongation could be restored by a heat treatment in case of CB, but not for MWNT. An important finding was that bi-component melt spinning technology (core/sheath structure) facilitated the use of higher filler concentrations producing fibres with higher conductivity.
