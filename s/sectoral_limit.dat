This example illustrate some of the difficulties that can appear in the process of regulating water uses (i. e. demand), such as the relevance of both property rights and public policies, the importance of non-water related regulation (in this case electricity/energy policy), or the emergence of new use (ecosystem needs) and the reallocation of water among (pre-existing) competing use(r) s.

Only structural growth, constituting on average approximately 20 per cent of total growth, is potentially affected by regionally varying locational characteristics. The second network novelty we introduce is revealed competition {{as a measure}} of regional network membership in the growth analysis. Applying a neo-classical regional growth model using geographically weighted regression, we show that the degree of revealed competition in trade and services between sectors moderates regional structural growth. Regions operating on similar international markets share more favourable structural growth prospects, with locational determinants being more - albeit still limited - significant due to similar externalities. With regional characteristics being of <b>limited</b> <b>sectoral</b> and geographical importance for structural growth, our results suggest that the recently advocated place-based development strategies of European regions should be complemented with competitive regional network strategies...|$|R

40|$|In the {{negotiations}} of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), new market mechanisms are proposed to involve Non-Annex I {{countries in the}} carbon markets developed by Annex I countries, beyond their current involvement through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Sectoral trading is one such mechanism. It would consist of coupling one economic sector of a Non-Annex I country, e. g., the Chinese electricity sector, with the carbon market of some Annex I countries, e. g., the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Previous research analyzed the potential impacts of such a mechanism and concluded that a limit would likely be set {{on the amount of}} carbon permits that could be imported from the non-Annex I country to the Annex I carbon market, should such a mechanism come into effect. This paper analyzes the impact of limited trading in carbon permits between the EU ETS and Chinese electricity sector when the latter is constrained by a 10 % emissions reduction target below business as usual by 2030. The limit on the amount of Chinese carbon permits that could be sold into the European carbon market is modeled through the introduction of a trade certificate system. The analysis employs the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model and takes into account the banking–borrowing of allowances and the inclusion of aviation emissions in the EU ETS. We find that if the amount of permits that can be imported from China to Europe is 10 % of the total amount of European allowances, the European carbon price decreases by 34 %, while it decreases by 74 % when sectoral trading is not limited. As a consequence, <b>limited</b> <b>sectoral</b> trading does not reverse the changes initiated in the European electricity sector as much as unlimited sectoral trading would. We also observe that international leakage and leakage to non-electricity sectors in China are lower under <b>limited</b> <b>sectoral</b> trading, thus achieving more emissions reductions at the aggregate level. Finally, we find that, if China can capture the rents due to the <b>limit</b> on <b>sectoral</b> trading, it is possible to find a limit that makes both regions better off relative to when there is no international trade in carbon permits.

40|$|The present {{understanding}} of bottlenecks in the European transport network fails {{to grasp the}} cumulating and culminating effects of bottlenecks, for {{the scope of the}} research is in most cases limited to a one-sided (logistics) perspective. A theoretical framework has been created, which argues that bottlenecks should be interpreted as integrative, complex problems, operating on the cutting edge between transportation, spatial planning, environmental issues, economic development and transnational governance. This chapter will provide empirical evidence to support this framework, in a context of European transport corridor development. The theoretical framework has been tested in an empirical setting by zooming in on the European transport Corridor 24. In a first step, both general (macro-level) and specific (micro-level) bottlenecks have been identified by interviewing logistics experts. In a next step, these first results will be further used to perform an in-depth, qualitative analysis of bottlenecks in case-study areas along Corridor 24. One of the key findings is that bottlenecks emerge from different, sectoral perspectives. Moreover, these perspectives appear to be highly interrelated. In other words, more attention should be paid to the cumulating and culminating effects of bottlenecks, operating as comprehensive problem areas. The most important implication is that, when using a <b>limited,</b> <b>sectoral</b> perspective on bottlenecks, one loses track of the possible added value of sector-transcendent analyses. This will ultimately lead to inefficient use of transport networks.

40|$|Improvements {{could be}} made to the reform agenda for teachers, {{principals}} and other school workers that governments are pursuing, according to this draft report. The draft report - Schools Workforce - finds that governments have initiated a substantial reform agenda to target issues such as teacher shortages, educational disadvantage, {{and the quality of the}} school workforce, including inadequate management of teacher performance. While it is generally too early to assess the impacts of these reforms, a small number of additional measures are warranted to build on the reforms and address some problematic initiatives. The Commission 2 ̆ 7 s proposals include: exploring more explicit use of higher pay to attract teachers for hard-to-staff subjects andschools deferring full-scale introduction of a proposed national performance bonus scheme forteachers until more is known. Instead, small-scale trials of performance pay and improvementsto teacher 2 ̆ 7 s appraisal and feedback should be supported revising national accreditation standards for graduate entry teacher training so that a courselength of two years is an option, rather than being mandatory. The report also identifies educational disadvantage as an area that must be a high priority for schools workforce reform. Deputy Chairman, Michael Woods, noted that 2 ̆ 7 despite a long history of policies in this area, there is a limited understanding of what is most effective. The Commission has therefore called for a comprehensive evaluation of programs that target disadvantaged students, as part of a wider push to embed robust evaluation in the policy process for school reform. 2 ̆ 7 The Commission proposes that greater school autonomy be accompanied by necessary leadership skills, resources and local governance arrangements. Greater flexibility in the industrial relations regime for school workers is also desirable to accommodate school-level variation in work arrangements. The Commission is seeking feedback on the draft report, including input on a possible performance-based career structure for teachers. The report will be finalised in April 2012. Background On 22 April 2010, the Productivity Commission received a terms of reference from the Australian Government asking it to undertake a commissioned study of the education and training workforce.

40|$|Management of {{tropical}} fisheries often fails {{because of a}} <b>limited</b> <b>sectoral</b> approach that disregards the livelihoods of small-scale fishermen. Fishermen are viewed as specialists, although many fisheries cannot provide an income that is large and stable enough to allow for such specialisation. The economic outcome of the enterprise {{is linked to the}} production patterns of the resource, and the dynamics of the resource affect the livelihood strategies of the people exploiting these resources. The limiting factors for specialisation in four enterprises exploiting natural resources (purse-seine fishery, sago extraction, nutmeg and clove cultivation) were studied in terms of size, patterns and uncertainty in production and income in the coastal community on Ambon and the Lease Islands (Moluccas, Indonesia). This was done for labourers and owners of fishing gear and land. Only owners of purse-seine vessels have sufficient mean income to maintain their families (27. 5 rice equivalents per day), although the basic uncertainty in their daily income is extremely high (CV= 410 %). For owners of the other three enterprises income is not enough to maintain a household, because of the small scale of the production units, being only tens of trees. For labourers, the daily incomes from fishing and sago extraction are too low (mean INCOME= 3. 2 and 4. 1 rice equivalents per day) to maintain their households of six members at the poverty level (0. 88 rice equivalents per capita per day), although both activities can be practised almost year round. Moreover, daily income for labourers from the fishery is highly uncertain because of the uncertainty in daily catches (CV= 220 %), which is not reduced by price compensation. Although the sharing system reduces the basic uncertainty in the daily income of labourers, the resulting income is still highly uncertain, ranging from 0 to 78 rice equivalents per day (CV= 170 %). Mean daily income from nutmeg and clove picking are several times higher (8. 4 and 13. 9 rice equivalents per day), but because of the limited temporal availability of these resources (roughly two months per year for both spices), they cannot provide enough income to maintain a household. The low income and high uncertainty for the labourers involved mean that the purse-seine fishery cannot provide a stable basic income: to stabilise it, other sources of income are needed. This has consequences for many characteristics of the fishery, such as the large proportion of part-time fishermen, the allocation of fishing effort and the type of technical innovations implemented in the fishery...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{pressures}} on the Earth System have reached a scale where abrupt global environmental change {{can no longer be}} excluded. We propose a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere < 350 ppm and/or a maximum change of + 1 W m- 2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80 % of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone (< 5 % reduction in O 3 concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N 2 to 35 Tg N yr- 1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use (< 4000 km 3 yr- 1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (< 15 % of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of < 10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social–ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of “planetary boundaries” lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially <b>sectoral</b> analyses of <b>limits</b> to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the “planetary playing field” for humanity if we want to be sure of avoiding major human-induced environmental change on a global scale...|$|R
40|$|Services {{industry}} {{has emerged as}} an important sector underpinning the economy, especially those in developed countries, and spanned to lower tier countries through inflows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and globalisation. Producer services, as a significant service component, experienced the growth in terms of activity and establishments in the metropolitan areas and then shaped (or reshaped) their most central district (area). Ho Chi Minh City, as the largest city of Vietnam, {{plays an important role}} as a gateway city in attracting FDI which is believed a hitch for the current fast economic growth after the country promulgated the open policy in 1986. Within this context, producer services have emerged in this city. It was found that their growth closely relates to the flows of FDI. That outcome suggests that there are important differences between Non- Vietnamese and Vietnamese firms in the development of this sector and in the spatial patterns. The aim of this research is to explore the role of producer services and identify how their growth, through the numbers and types, influences Ho Chi Minh City in the spatial aspects; particularly the research focuses on the location of producer service firms in the city's central area. The outcome of the research will provide insight on the link between the producer service {{and the development of a}} large city of an emerging economy. In a local planning perspective, the thesis, as one of the first specific studies on the producer services in Vietnam, has it own enthusiasm to contribute its understanding and findings to the current urban planning to cope with the rapidly changing economy in a global era. In search of the role of producer services in the national economy and their spatial influences, the research has used the Yellow Pages Data as the major approach for its analyses due to the current lack of data on service employment and <b>limited</b> <b>sectoral</b> information. Questionnaire and interviews survey have also been carried out to enrich and justify the information. Given an important factor that the emergence of producer services in Vietnam relied on FDI, the analyses of the research basically based on the nationality framework in order to uncover the significance of the two groups of firms: Non Vietnamese and Vietnamese. The research has also embedded the city planning policy as its implication in order to provide insightful information for the future location and growth of producer services.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{elements}} characterizing innovation and its effects in small and medium firms in a Southern Italian area, where the specialization is mainly concentrated in traditional sectors, {{the size of the}} firm affects consistently the chance to innovate and, at the same time, generally there is no Research and Development (R&D) department inside the firm. The paper aims to understand whether there are cases of small and medium firms able to exploit a competitive advantage using their innovative capability, beside the <b>sectoral</b> and size <b>limits.</b> One of the main expected result is to understand if in province of Salerno the size and the sector of the firm represent a limit in introducing some sort innovation (product, process or in the organization structure). In particular, we want to investigate if it is possible to innovate, in those firms where there is no R&D function. At the same time, if there is innovation, we want to understand what are the main factors of influence. In fact, apart those traditional elements (Griliches, 95) that have a positive and significant role innovation, we want to analyze if other elements, such as entrepreneur education, learning or the networks characterising the relationship between small and medium firms, {{play a key role in}} the introduction of innovation, and if the expected result is an improvement it the competitive position of firms. Innovation has became an important point in economic theory since is positive effect in assessing a competitive advantage to the firms adopting it is widely accepted. Researcher have focused on the determinants and on the effects of innovation, which is usually expected to give, at least, a temporary competitive advantage to the firm and an impact to sector dynamics (Nelson and Winter, 82; Dosi, 88; Freeman and Soete, 87). Usually innovation is strictly linked to the major dimension of the firms and to a competitive advantage of them, but: can be a firm be innovative even if it has not a relevant size and do not compete in a dynamic, innovative sector? In this cases, innovation may be linked to the way in which the firms interact between them, circulate ideas and information. Besides we considered as important some characteristics of the management or the entrepreneur, in fact an important element was the variable of the firm‐owner’s previous activity and his/her level of education, in order to investigate the training and professional background. In fact, another point of investigation is the effect of innovation, since R&D effort does not give a measure of the effects of innovation and there are different sources of innovation, especially in traditional sectors where very often technologies are embodied in new machinery and equipment. The data used was drawn from the OPIS databank, a survey on a sample of about 500 firms of the province of Salerno (Italy). An important section was devoted to collect information on the type (process, product and organizational) and the timing of innovations, the effectiveness and way in which the enterprise acquired information about the innovations. The econometric methodology consist of the estimation of an Heckman probit model or probit with sample selection. In fact, we estimate, the probability that innovation is successful, controlling for the selection bias deriving form the fact that the output of the innovations was know only for firms that have introduced the innovation...|$|R
