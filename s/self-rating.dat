40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of parental longevity and <b>self-rated</b> life expectancy on mortality, building upon the es-tablished model of <b>self-rated</b> health predicting mortality. A community sample of Australians aged 70 and over was sur-veyed in 1992 and 1995. The associations of interest were examined separately by sex using weighted multiple logistic regression. Parental ages at death were not associated with mortality for either men or women. In multivariate models, <b>self-rated</b> life expectancy had an independent effect on men's mortality and did not reduce the effect of <b>self-rated</b> health on mortality. Our findings from Australia are consistent with results from many countries; the effect of <b>self-rated</b> health on mortality is stronger for men than for women.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore whether the objectively {{assessed}} memory is correlated with the <b>self-rated</b> memory, and does the <b>self-rated</b> memory ability differ among ages. Methods: Data was obtained from the Evergreen project. A total of 558 people aged between 72 and 92 years were included in the current study. In order to examine the complexity of the relationships between <b>self-rated</b> memory and objective memory ability of the older people, cognitive functioning was assessed by metacognitive self-evaluations and Mini-D cognitive screening test. Main Results: Mini-D sum score and <b>self-rated</b> memory decline was significantly correlated (p = 34). No significant age difference for <b>self-rated</b> memory ability was found (OR=. 99, 95 % CI=. 61 - 1. 43).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <b>Self-rated</b> {{health is}} a widely used measure of health status, but its {{biologic}} foundations are poorly understood. We investigated the association of frequently used biomarkers with <b>self-rated</b> health, {{and the role of}} these biomarkers in the association of <b>self-rated</b> health with mortality. METHODS: The relation of <b>self-rated</b> health to blood levels of albumin, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, HDL cholesterol, and creatinine was examined in a population-based sample of 4, 065 men and women aged 71 years or older. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the association of <b>self-rated</b> health with mortality during 4. 9 years. Sociodemographic factors, diagnosed chronic conditions, and activities of daily living disability were controlled for in these analyses. RESULTS: All the biomarkers showed a graded relationship with <b>self-rated</b> health. After adjusting for other indicators, hemoglobin and white cell count were significantly associated with fair or poor <b>self-rated</b> health. When biomarkers and other indicators were adjusted for, <b>self-rated</b> health still {{was a significant predictor of}} mortality. CONCLUSION: <b>Self-rated</b> health has a biologic basis, and it can be a sensitive barometer of physiologic states. <b>Self-rated</b> health is likely to predict mortality because it covers the spectrum of health conditions better than the variables measured in the study...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aims of {{this study}} were to examine dif-ferences between older men and women: (a) in the ability of <b>self-rated</b> health to predict mortality, (b) in the effect of {{different}} follow-up periods on the <b>self-rated</b> health mortality relationship, and (c) in the relative importance of <b>self-rated</b> health and <b>self-rated</b> change in health in predicting mortality. Design and Methods: By using data from the Nottingham Longi-tudinal Study of Activity and Ageing, the author assessed relationships between <b>self-rated</b> health and <b>self-rated</b> change in health and 4 - and 12 -year mortality in separate unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models in men and women. Results: The {{differences between men and women}} in the hazard ratios for poor <b>self-rated</b> health were not significant, although there were differences in the explanatory factors. The relationship between <b>self-rated</b> health and short-term and long-term mortal-ity was explained by age and health among men. The relationship between <b>self-rated</b> health and short-term mortality was explained by age, physical and mental health, and physical activity among women. The relationship between <b>self-rated</b> health and long-term mortality was explained by age, physical health, and physical activity among women. The relationship between <b>self-rated</b> change in health and short-term mortality was explained by age among men and women. The relationship between <b>self-rated</b> change in health and long-term mortality was explained by age and physical health among men and women. Social engagement was an independent predictor of short- and long-term mortality among men and women in this study. Implications: The finding that low <b>self-rated</b> health was not an independent pre-dictor of mortality among men or women, contrary to many, but not all, previous studies, may be related to differences in study design and/or across cultures. Further research investigating relationships between <b>self-rated</b> health and mortality and potential explan-atory variables should analyze men and women separately and should consider the length of follow-up period.

40|$|Objectives: Procedural justice {{perceptions}} are {{shown to be}} associated with minor psychiatric disorders, long sickness absence spells and poor <b>self-rated</b> health, but previous studies have rarely considered how changes in procedural justice influence changes in health. Methods: Data from four consecutive biennial waves of the Swedish Longitudinal Survey of Health (SLOSH) study (N= 5, 854) were used to examine trajectories of <b>self-rated</b> health. Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic position, and marital status, we study the predictive power of change in procedural justice perceptions using individual growth curve models within a multilevel framework. Results: The results show that <b>self-rated</b> health trajectories slowly decline over time. The rate of change was influenced by age and sex, with older people and women showing a slower rate of change in <b>self-rated</b> health. After adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic position, and marital status, procedural justice was significantly associated with <b>self-rated</b> health. Also, improvements in procedural justice were associated with improvements in <b>self-rated</b> health. Additionally, a reverse relationship with <b>self-rated</b> health and change in <b>self-rated</b> health predicting procedural justice was found. Conclusions: Our findings support the idea that procedural justice at work is a crucial aspect of the psychosocial work environment and that changes towards more procedural justice could influence <b>self-rated</b> health positively.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Self-rated</b> health, as {{distinct}} from objective measures of health, is a clinically informative metric among older adults. The purpose of our {{study was to examine}} the cognitive and psychosocial factors associated with <b>self-rated</b> health. Methods: 624 participants over the age of 60 were assessed at baseline, and of these, 510 were contacted for a follow-up two years later. Measures of executive function and <b>self-rated</b> health were assessed at baseline, and <b>self-rated</b> health was assessed at follow-up. We employed multiple linear regression analyses to investigate the relationship between executive functioning and <b>self-rated</b> health, while controlling for demographic, psychosocial and biological variables. Results: Controlling for other relevant variables, executive functioning independently and solely predicted <b>self-rated</b> health, both at a cross-sectional level, and also over time. Loneliness was also found to cross-sectionally predict <b>self-rated</b> health, although this relationship was not present at a longitudinal level. Conclusion: Older adults 2 ̆ 7 <b>self-rated</b> health may be related to their executive functioning and to their loneliness. <b>Self-rated</b> health appeared to improve over time, and the extent of this improvement was also related to executive functioning at baseline. <b>Self-rated</b> health may be a judgement made of one 2 ̆ 7 s functioning, especially executive functioning, which changes with age and therefore may be particularly salient in the reflections of older adult...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. <b>Self-rated</b> {{health is}} a {{powerful}} predictor of health-related outcomes such as morbidity and mortality. Aim {{of the current study}} was to examine the role of comorbidity, well-being, functional health and physical limitations as possible predictors of <b>self-rated</b> health in diabetes and chronic heart failure. Methods. Three large samples with persons suffering from diabetes (n= 974), chronic heart failure (n= 955) or both diseases combined (n= 934) were analyzed longitudinally over the course of 4 months. To test the mediating effect of comorbidity, well-being, functional health and physical limitations in the association of former and future <b>self-rated</b> health multiple mediator models were applied. Results. Across all groups emotional well-being was a consistent and powerful determinant of <b>self-rated</b> health. The effects of functional health and physical limitations on <b>self-rated</b> health were also significant but varied between diagnostic groups. The number of comorbid diseases did not predict <b>self-rated</b> health. Conclusions. Emotional well-being and the measures of physical health appraisal were strong predictors of <b>self-rated</b> health.

40|$|Objective: <b>Self-rated</b> {{health is}} a {{powerful}} and independent predictor of long-term health, but its biological basis is unknown. Because factors associated with poor <b>self-rated</b> health (eg, pain, daily discomforts, and low energy and fitness) resemble symptoms of a generalized cytokine-induced sickness response, we {{examined the relationship between}} circulating cytokines and <b>self-rated</b> health. Methods: In 265 consecutive primary health care patients (174 women and 91 men), we examined <b>self-rated</b> and physician-rated health, circulating levels of interleukin (IL) - 1, IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 ra), IL- 6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - as determined from plasma samples using high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunoassay. Results: <b>Self-rated</b> health correlated with levels of IL- 1 (r 0. 27; p. 001), IL- 1 ra (r 0. 19; p. 05) and TNF- (r 0. 46; p. 001) in women but not in men. Thus, poorer subjective health was associated with higher levels of inflammatory cytokines. Even when controlling for age, education, physical health, and diagnoses in multiple regression analyses, <b>self-rated</b> health was an independent and more robust predictor of cytokine levels than physician-rated health. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that an individual’s health perception may be coupled to circulating cytokines.

40|$|Objectives: Despite the {{well-established}} {{association between}} <b>self-rated</b> health and mortality, research {{findings have been}} inconsistent regarding how men and women differ on this link. Using a national sample in the United States, this study compared American male and female older adults for the predictive role of baseline <b>self-rated</b> health on the short-term risk of mortality. Methods: This longitudinal study followed 1500 older adults (573 men (38. 2 %) and 927 women (61. 8 %)) aged 66 [*]years or older for 3 [*]years from 2001 to 2004. The main predictor of interest was <b>self-rated</b> health, which was measured using a single item in 2001. The outcome was the risk of all-cause mortality during the 3 -year follow-up period. Demographic factors (race and age), socio-economic factors (education and marital status), and health behaviors (smoking and drinking) were covariates. Gender was the focal moderator. We ran logistic regression models in the pooled sample and also stratified by gender, with <b>self-rated</b> health treated as either nominal variables, poor compared to other levels (i. e. fair, good, or excellent) or excellent compared to other levels (i. e. good, fair, or poor), or an ordinal variable. Results: In the pooled sample, baseline <b>self-rated</b> health predicted mortality risk, regardless of how the variable was treated. We found a significant interaction between gender and poor <b>self-rated</b> health, indicating a stronger effect of poor <b>self-rated</b> health on mortality risk for men compared to women.
