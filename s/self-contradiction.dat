5|$|Cibber's comedy Love's Last Shift (1696) is {{an early}} herald of a massive shift in {{audience}} taste, away from the intellectualism and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender-role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. According to Paul Parnell, Love's Last Shift illustrates Cibber's opportunism at {{a moment in time}} before the change was assured: fearless of <b>self-contradiction,</b> he puts something for everybody into his first play, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness.|$|E

To Charvakas, the text states, the Vedas suffered from several faults – errors in transmission across generations, untruth, <b>self-contradiction</b> and tautology. The Charvakas {{pointed out the}} disagreements, debates and mutual rejection by karmakanda Vedic priests and jñānakanda Vedic priests, as proof that {{either one of them}} is wrong or both are wrong, as both cannot be right.|$|E
25|$|Karl Marx and the Close of His System (1896) {{examined}} Marx's {{theory of}} labour value, claiming the basic error in Marx's system to {{have resulted from}} a <b>self-contradiction</b> of Marx's law of value, namely how the rate of profit and the prices of production of the third volume of Marx's Capital contradict Marx's theory of value in the first volume. He also attacks Marx for downplaying the influence {{of supply and demand}} in determining permanent price, and for deliberate ambiguity with such concepts.|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} study to {{systematically}} assess lawyers' questioning of children in Scotland, we examined 56 trial transcripts of 5 - to 17 -year-old children testifying as alleged victims of sexual abuse, focusing on differences between prosecutors and defense lawyers {{with respect to the}} types of questions asked and effects on witnesses' responses. Prosecutors used more invitations, directives, and option-posing prompts than defense lawyers, who used more suggestive prompts than prosecutors. Children were more unresponsive and less informative when answering defense lawyers than prosecutors. All children contradicted themselves at least once, with defense lawyers eliciting more <b>self-contradictions</b> than prosecutors. Suggestive questions were most likely to elicit <b>self-contradictions,</b> with suggestive confrontational and introductory questions eliciting significantly more <b>self-contradictions</b> than suggestive suppositions. Children also acquiesced more in response to tagged suggestions than untagged suggestions. Overall, lawyers altered their behavior little in response to variations in children's ages. This research was supported by an Economic and Social Research Council studentship to Samantha J. Andrews...|$|R
500|$|Love's Last Shift {{can be seen}} as {{an early}} sign of Cibber's {{sensitivity}} to shifts of public opinion, which was to be useful to him in his later career as manager at Drury Lane (see Colley Cibber). In the 1690s, the economic and political power balance of the nation tilted from the aristocracy towards the middle class after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and middle-class values of religion, morality, and gender roles became more dominant, not least in attitudes to the stage. Love's Last Shift {{is one of the first}} illustrations of a massive shift in audience taste, away from the analytic bent and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. The play illustrates Cibber's opportunism at a moment in time before the change was assured: fearless of <b>self-contradiction,</b> he puts something into his first play to please every section of the audience, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness. The way Vanbrugh, in his turn, allows the reformed rake to relapse quite cheerfully, and has the only preaching in the play come from the comically corrupt parson of [...] "Fatgoose Living", has made some early 20th-century critics refer to The Relapse as the last of the true Restoration comedies. However, Vanbrugh's play is also affected by the taste of the 1690s, and compared to a play like the courtier William Wycherley's The Country Wife of 20 years earlier, with its celebration of predatory aristocratic masculinity, The Relapse contains quite a few moments of morality and uplift. In fact it has a kind of parallel structure to Love's Last Shift: in the climactic scene of Cibber's play, Amanda's virtue reforms her husband, and in the corresponding scene of The Relapse, it reforms her admirer Worthy. Such moments have not done the play any favours with modern critics.|$|E

In other words, neither Einstein nor Langevin saw the story of the twins as constituting a challenge to the self-consistency of relativistic physics.|$|E

2500|$|The pontiff was {{comparing}} apparently contradictory {{passages from}} the Qur'an, one being that [...] "There is no compulsion in religion", the other being that it is acceptable to [...] "spread the faith through violence". The pontiff argued the latter teaching to be unreasonable and advocated that religious conversion should take place {{through the use of}} reason. His larger point here was that, generally speaking, in Christianity, God is understood to act in accordance with reason, while in Islam, God's absolute transcendence means that [...] "God is not bound even by his own word", and can act in ways contrary to reason, including <b>self-contradiction.</b> At the end of his lecture, the Pope said, [...] "It is to the great logos, to this breadth of reason, that we invite our partners in the dialogue of cultures." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several texts concern {{themselves}} with the subsequent lives of the apostles, usually with highly supernatural events. Almost half of these, anciently called The Circuits of the Apostles and now known {{by the name of}} their purported author, [...] "Leucius Charinus" [...] (supposedly a companion of John the apostle), contained the Acts of Peter, John, Andrew, Thomas, and Paul. These were judged by the Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople in the ninth century to be full of folly, <b>self-contradiction,</b> falsehood, and impiety. The Acts of Thomas and the Acts of Peter and the Twelve are often considered Gnostic texts. While most of the texts are believed to have been written in the 2nd century, at least two, the Acts of Barnabas and the Acts of Peter and Paul are believed to have been written as late as the 5th century.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{importance}} of the Induction, Jonathan Bate and Eric Rasmussen argue [...] "the Sly framework establishes a self-referential theatricality in which the status of the shrew-play as a play is enforced." [...] Graham Holderness argues [...] "the play in its received entirety does not propose any simple or unitary view of sexual politics: it contains a crudely reactionary dogma of masculine supremacy, but it also works on that ideology to force its expression into <b>self-contradiction.</b> The means by which this self-interrogation is accomplished is that complex theatrical device of the Sly-framework [...] without the metadramatic potentialities of the Sly-framework, any production of Shrew is thrown much more passively {{at the mercy of the}} director's artistic and political ideology." [...] Coppélia Kahn suggests [...] "the transformation of Christopher Sly from drunken lout to noble lord, a transformation only temporary and skin-deep, suggests that Kate's switch from independence may also be deceptive and prepares us for the irony of the dénouement." [...] The Induction serves to undercut charges of misogyny – the play within the play is a farce, it is not supposed to be taken seriously by the audience, as it is not taken seriously by Sly. As such, questions of the seriousness of what happens within it are rendered irrelevant.|$|E

But to appoint not only a woman who had for fifteen years worked in the chorus alongside several who were now principals, but the wife of one of the main principals, seemed to me to be a psychological error of the first magnitude. [...] I felt that ... she would, rightly or wrongly, be accused of that very same favouritism. [...] My views made no impression on Miss Carte, but time was to prove that I was right. [...] Discontent grew, changes were constantly taking place, and criticism became rampant.
