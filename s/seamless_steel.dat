The 1989 LS 400 became the first production automobile to receive extensive laser welding, allowing for <b>seamless</b> <b>steel</b> welds. A large sheet metal press was developed to reduce or eliminate panel gaps by stamping large sections whole instead of singly. Separately installed parts, such as exterior lights, were also spring-loaded for a tighter fit. On the LS 400, engineers reduced door panel gaps in half versus Toyota-brand vehicles, from , with measurements made within on the LS 430, measurement margins were increased tenfold, to [...] When production switched to the LS 460, the number of laser welds was doubled.|$|E

2500|$|The Corvette Grand Sports were raced {{with several}} {{different}} engines, {{but the most}} serious factory engine actually used was a 377 cubic inch displacement, all-aluminum, small block with four Weber side-draft carburetors and a cross-ram intake, rated [...] at 6400rpm. Body panels were made of thinner fiberglass to reduce weight and the inner body structure 'birdcage' was aluminum rather than steel. The ladder-type frame utilized large <b>seamless</b> <b>steel</b> tubular side members connected front and rear with crossmembers of about the same diameter tubes. Another crossmember was just aft of the transmission and a fourth one at the rear kick-up anchored the integral roll cage. The frame was slightly stiffer than the 1963 Corvette production frame and was 94 pounds lighter. A number of other lightweight components were utilized to reduce overall weight to about 800 pounds less than the production coupe. Initially the Grand Sport project was known simply as [...] "The Lightweight".|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the good}} {{mechanical}} properties of forged parts, the forging process plays a decisive role in the manufacturing of <b>seamless</b> stainless <b>steel</b> pipes for {{oil country tubular goods}} (OCTG) lines. Tough competition between manufacturers gives them plenty of incentive to make their processes in raw material and energy usage more and more efficient. In this context the expansion process is one of the critical production steps in the manufacturing of <b>seamless</b> stainless <b>steel</b> pipes. This work presents a sensitivity analysis of a finite element method (FEM) for the simulation of the expansion of the alloy UNS N 08028. The input parameters ram speed, tool angle, initial ID and final ID of the billet as well as temperature were used to describe responses like tool wear and material loss. With the aim to minimize the tool wear and to reduce the material waste, a study of influence of the input parameters on the mentioned responses were performed. This development is supported by experimental work in order to validate the simulation model. The sector demand for new materials with specific properties and the cost-intensive experimental trials justifies the use of such simulation tools and opens great opportunities for the industry...|$|R

40|$|A newly {{developed}} prototype {{system for the}} ultrasonic inspection <b>seamless</b> ferritic <b>steel</b> tubes using electromagnetic-ultrasonic transduction is described.

A typical radiation pattern for the angle-beam mode is illustrated. The sensitivity of the system satisfies the German SEP 1915 and SEP 1918 standards. Detection of the corresponding calibration defects is achieved at a circumferential speed of 2 m/s with a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 dB.

40|$|In {{the large}} plastic {{deformation}} of a tubular cantilever beam loaded by a force at its tip, the strain hardening {{of the material}} tends to increase the load-carrying capacity, while local buckling and cross-sectional ovalization (flattening) occurring in the neighbourhood of the root tends to reduce the moment-carrying capacity and results in structural softening. Experiments were carried out for <b>seamless</b> mild <b>steel</b> tubular cantilevers of radius thickness ratio ranging from 9 to 20 to explore the development of local buckling and flattening and to examine its influence on the global load-carrying capacity of the beam.
