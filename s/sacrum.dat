5|$|Stravinsky {{had already}} used twelve-tone {{technique}} {{earlier in the}} 1950s, both in Canticum <b>Sacrum</b> (1955) and in Agon (1957). But neither of these is exclusively dodecaphonic, whereas Threni is.|$|E
5|$|Blood is {{supplied}} to the cervix by the descending {{branch of the}} uterine artery and drains into the uterine vein. The pelvic splanchnic nerves, emerging as S2S3, transmit the sensation of pain from the cervix to the brain. These nerves travel along the uterosacral ligaments, which pass from the uterus to the anterior <b>sacrum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on which}} bones are present, sex can be {{determined}} by looking for distinctive sexual dimorphisms. When available, the pelvis is extremely useful in the determination of sex and when properly examined can achieve sex determination with a great level of accuracy. The examination of the pubic arch {{and the location of}} the <b>sacrum</b> can help determine sex.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportions}} of the legs, pelvis and <b>sacrum</b> of the Rodrigues and red rail were generally similar. The Rodrigues rail differed from the red rail by having a broader and shorter skull, longer and lower nostrils, a proportionately longer humerus, a shorter, stouter femur, {{as well as a}} considerably different plumage, based on early descriptions.|$|E
5|$|All {{the figures}} are adorned with carved {{ornaments}} and surrounded by borders with reliefs of animals and birds. The lotus design is a common theme. On the ceiling are images of the Vidyadhara couples as well as couples in courtship and erotic Mithuna scenes. Through a cleft in {{the back wall of}} the cave is a square sanctuary with more carved images. In the mandapa is a seated Nandi facing the garbha ghriya (<b>sacrum</b> sanctum) containing a Shiva linga.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} {{is reasonably}} complete {{and includes a}} partial skull. Sauropod skull bones are rarely found, and the Amargasaurus skull {{is only the second}} skull known from a member of the Dicraeosauridae. Major parts of the skeleton were found in their original anatomical position: the vertebral column of the neck and back, which consisted of 22 articulated vertebrae, was found connected to both the skull and the <b>sacrum.</b> Of the skull, only the temporal region and the braincase are preserved. The <b>sacrum,</b> despite being partly eroded prior to burial, is fairly complete. Most of the tail is missing, with three anterior, three middle, and one posterior vertebrae being preserved, along with fragments of several others. The shoulder girdle is known from the scapula (shoulder blade) and coracoid (which sits on {{the lower end of the}} scapula), while the pelvis is merely known from the ilium (the uppermost of the three pelvic bones). The limbs are equally fragmentary, with the manus (hand) and most of the pes (foot) missing. The skeleton is currently stored in the collection of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|The {{trunk of}} Dinocephalosaurus {{has at least}} 26 {{vertebrae}}. In Dinocephalosaurus, {{there appear to be}} no lumbar vertebrae, or vertebrae of the trunk lacking ribs. The ribs of the <b>sacrum</b> and tail also {{do not appear to be}} fused to their corresponding vertebrae. Each of the gastralia in Dinocephalosaurus is composed of three elements instead of four as in Tanystropheus; they differ in that Dinocephalosaurus only has one element on the midline, while Tanystropheus has two elements that combine to form a midline bar.|$|E
5|$|Though {{a myriad}} of bones was {{available}} by 1969, many important ones were missing or hard to interpret. There were few postorbital skull elements, no femurs, no <b>sacrum,</b> no furcula or sternum, missing vertebrae, and (Ostrom thought) only a tiny fragment of a coracoid. Ostrom's skeletal reconstruction of Deinonychus included a very unusual pelvic bone– a pubis that was trapezoidal and flat, unlike that of other theropods, but which was the same length as the ischium and which was found right next to it.|$|E
5|$|Among the Eolambia {{specimens}} {{found to}} date, the best-preserved <b>sacrum</b> includes seven vertebrae. Given that this individual is immature, and hadrosaurs increase their sacral vertebra count with age, adults {{may have had}} more sacrals. The caudal (tail) vertebrae are amphicoelous, having both {{the front and back}} ends being concave. They have pedestal-like prezygapophyses and tab-like postzygapophyses, the latter of which are separated by a depression. The prezygapophyses lengthen to become stalks and the postzygapophyses shrink in the middle and rear caudals. Furthermore, the neural spines transition from rectangular to strongly curved (concave in front and convex behind), the centra become more elongated, and the transverse processes disappear as well.|$|E
5|$|BMNH R.3078 {{was found}} at Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, in strata of the Upper Oxford Clay and {{consists}} {{of a series of}} vertebrae from the rear half of the skeleton. Other remains, including a front leg with fossilized cartilage in its joint, a hind leg, and a partial <b>sacrum</b> have been referred to and accepted as C. stewarti. A whiplash tail from the same locality was thought by Charig as possibly belonging to Cetiosauriscus, but the assignment is not fully accepted by paleontologists. With that much material, Cetiosauriscus {{is one of the most}} complete sauropods from the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|By 1824, the {{material}} available to Buckland consisted of specimen OUM J13505, {{a piece of}} a right lower jaw with a single erupted tooth; OUM J13577, a posterior dorsal vertebra; OUM J13579, an anterior caudal vertebra; OUM J13576, a <b>sacrum</b> of five sacral vertebrae; OUM J13585, a cervical rib; OUM J13580, a rib; OUM J29881, an ilium of the pelvis, OUM J13563, a piece of the pubic bone; OUM J13565, a part of the ischium; OUM J13561, a thighbone and OUM J13572, the lower part of a second metatarsal. As he himself was aware, these did not all belong to the same individual; only the <b>sacrum</b> was articulated. Because they represented several individuals, the described fossils formed a syntype series. By modern standards, from these a single specimen has to be selected to serve as the type specimen on which the name is based. In 1990, Ralph Molnar chose the famous dentary (front part of the lower jaw), OUM J13505, as such a lectotype. Because he was unaccustomed to the deep dinosaurian pelvis, much taller than with typical reptiles, Buckland misidentified several bones, interpreting the pubic bone as a fibula and mistaking the ischium for a clavicle. Buckland identified the organism as being a giant animal belonging to the Sauria – the Lizards, at the time seen as including the crocodiles – and he placed it in the new genus Megalosaurus, repeating an estimate by Cuvier that the largest pieces he described, indicated an animal twelve metres long in life.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} 198284 Suresh Srivastava, a GSI {{geologist}} at the Palaeontology Division of the GSI's Western Region, collected {{large numbers of}} bone fossil fragments from Rahioli, and also precisely mapped the area. These fossils {{were taken to the}} Palaeontology Division at Jaipur for identification. U. B. Mathur and Suresh Srivastava, under the supervision of S. C. Pant, meticulously cleaned many of the skeletal parts (braincase, dorsal and caudal vertebrae, <b>sacrum,</b> thigh bone, upper arm, shin bones, and others), leading to the publication of multiple research papers. There was a lull in further activity until a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with Punjab University in 199495.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Ostrom {{published}} another monograph on {{the shoulder}} of Deinonychus in which he realized that the pubis that he had described was actually a coracoid– a shoulder element. In that same year, another specimen of Deinonychus, MCZ 4371, was discovered and excavated in Montana by Steven Orzack during a Harvard University expedition headed by Farish Jenkins. This discovery added several new elements: well preserved femurs, pubes, a <b>sacrum,</b> and better ilia, as well as elements of the pes and metatarsus. Ostrom described this specimen and revised his skeletal restoration of Deinonychus. This time it showed the very long pubis, and Ostrom began to suspect that they may have even been a little retroverted like those of birds.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} description, Hennig did not designate a holotype specimen. However, in a detailed monography on the osteology, systematic position and palaeobiology of Kentrosaurus in 1925, Hennig picked {{the most complete}} partial skeleton, today inventorised as MB.R.4800.1 through MB.R.4800.37, as a lectotype (see syntype). This material includes a nearly complete series of tail vertebrae, several vertebrae of the back, a <b>sacrum</b> with five sacral vertebrae and both ilia, both femora and an ulna, and {{is included in the}} mounted skeleton at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. The type locality is Kindope, Tanzania, near the Tendaguru hill.|$|E
5|$|The hominid Australopithecus afarensis {{represents}} an evolutionary transition between modern bipedal humans and their quadrupedal ape ancestors. A number of traits of the A. afarensis skeleton strongly reflect bipedalism, {{to the extent}} that some researchers have suggested that bipedality evolved long before A. afarensis. In overall anatomy, the pelvis is far more human-like than ape-like. The iliac blades are short and wide, the <b>sacrum</b> is wide and positioned directly behind the hip joint, and there is clear evidence of a strong attachment for the knee extensors, implying an upright posture.|$|E
5|$|The lumbar (or lower back) {{region is}} made up of five {{vertebrae}} (L1–L5), sometimes including the <b>sacrum.</b> In between these vertebrae are fibrocartilaginous discs, which act as cushions, preventing the vertebrae from rubbing together {{while at the same time}} protecting the spinal cord. Nerves come from and go to the spinal cord through specific openings between the vertebrae, providing the skin with sensations and messages to muscles. Stability of the spine is provided by the ligaments and muscles of the back and abdomen. Small joints called facet joints limit and direct the motion of the spine.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} K. guimarotae are stored at the Institute of Geological Sciences of the Free University of Berlin (hereafter IPFUB). Alongside the type {{specimen}} IPFUB Gui Croc 7308 - {{which consists of}} a partial skull with jaws, a vertebra from the <b>sacrum,</b> and two osteoderms - over 400 additional specimens are known, most of them consisting of single isolated bones. Among these, the more complete specimens are IPFUB Gui Gui Croc 7352 (tail vertebrae, femur, osteoderms); 7441 (osteoderms and ulna); 7545 (dorsal vertebrae, ischia, osteoderms); 7564 (femur, humerus, osteoderms); 7634 (dorsal vertebrae, rib, osteoderms); and 8037 (cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and osteoderms). More specimens are known, but they remain unprepared. Some specimens show the marks of scavenging.|$|E
5|$|All ankylosaurs that possess these {{characteristics}} - a narrow predentary; a nearly horizontal quadrate {{that is not}} fused and is oriented 30 degrees from the skull roof; the presence of mandibular condyles that are three times wider than long; premaxillary and dentary teeth that are near a symphysis with {{the front of the}} lower jaw (the predentary); a <b>sacrum</b> arched on top; an acromion process above the midpoint of the scapula to coracoid attachment; a straight ischium with a straight dorsal margin; relatively long, slender limbs; sacral shield armour; and the presence of erect pelvic osteoderms with flat bases - form a clade of basal nodosaurids, the Struthiosaurinae. That set of cranial and postcranial features are only present on genera considered to be in the clade. The features above distinguish Struthiosaurinae from other clades and genera found by other analysis'.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{this section}} Heilmann embarks on a {{thorough}} description of the Berlin Archaeopteryx specimen, which includes detailed comparisons to specific aspects of modern birds. Following a comparison of its skull to that of Aetosaurus, Euparkeria, and a modern pigeon, Heilmann states that he disagrees with the scientific consensus {{of the time that}} the skull of Archaeopteryx is that of a true bird. He writes that the reptilian features of the skull are much more pronounced, citing features of the teeth, fenestrae, and jaw structure as being undeniably un-birdlike. Heilmann found that much of Archaeopteryxs anatomy, in fact, was decidedly reptilian and generally opposed to that of modern birds. This included the pelvis, which lacks a pectineal process and has a very different os <b>sacrum</b> from modern birds, as well as the carpus, which Heilmann wrote exhibited the same phenomena found in the wrists of modern reptiles. Its tail was also noted by Heilmann as being extremely reptilian and resembling nothing known of modern birds.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, further {{research}} on the fossils was continued by two American scientists sponsored by the American Institute of Indian Studies, New Delhi and the National Geographic Society, U.S.A. The Americans, Paul Sereno and Jeff Wilson, started {{the reconstruction of the}} collection of dinosaur bones gathered in 1983 and 1984. The team of scientists, after a detailed study of the maps prepared earlier by Srivastava, were able to reconstruct the partial skull, left and right hip bones, and a <b>sacrum.</b> They interpreted the part of a skull and a horn as resembling those of dinosaurs found in Madagascar. Fossils of Rajasaurus were also found near Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. In all, the collected fossils include a partial skull, limb bones, hip bones, and vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the {{evidence}} {{provided by the}} embryo suggests that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous, making it the first viviparous archosauromorph asides from possibly metriorhynchids. This {{is consistent with the}} separation of its sacral ribs from its <b>sacrum,</b> which indicates a mobile pelvis that could have functioned in giving birth. While the otherwise absence of viviparous archosaurs has been historically attributed to common attributes inherited from the archosaurian stem-lineage, the discovery that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous suggests that this phenomenon is due to lineage-specific lifestyle restrictions. Although the sex-determination systems among living archosauromorphs are diverse, with crocodilians and turtles using temperature-dependent sex determination, phylogenetic modelling suggests that Dinocephalosaurus retained the basal condition of genotypic sex determination from early diapsids, and that this system facilitated its transition to an obligately marine lifestyle alongside viviparity.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} (catalogue number QG24) {{has been}} found weathering out of a hill slope and was partially eroded by surface exponation and plant roots. It includes the pelvis and <b>sacrum,</b> most of the left hind limb and foot, a right thigh bone, and twelve anterior tail vertebrae. These remains pertain to a single individual as they were all found articulated (still connected together). Additionally, several disarticulated bones were found, including the right forearm and some metacarpalia and phalanges from both {{the right and left}} forefeet, probably also pertaining to this individual. Later, the site was revisited by the scientists Geoffrey Bond and Michael Cooper, who were able to collect additional remains including a scapula (specimen QG152, a shoulder blade) and a fragment of a neck vertebra. These remains show that more than one individual was present, and it is possible that they do not pertain to Vulcanodon at all. Today, the Vulcanodon remains are stored in the Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo.|$|E
5|$|There {{is about}} 125-150mL of CSF {{at any one}} time. This CSF circulates within the {{ventricular}} system of the brain. The ventricles {{are a series of}} cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two lateral ventricles. From here, the CSF passes through the interventricular foramina to the third ventricle, then the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the subarachnoid space through four openings – the central canal of the spinal cord, the median aperture, and the two lateral apertures. CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the <b>sacrum.</b> There is a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the perilymph in 93% of people.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops {{were long}} {{thought to have}} {{possibly}} used their horns and frills in combat with predators such as Tyrannosaurus, the idea being discussed first by C. H. Sternberg in 1917 and 70 years later by Robert Bakker. There is evidence that Tyrannosaurus did have aggressive head-on encounters with Triceratops, based on partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal; the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. Which animal was the aggressor is not known. Since the Triceratops wounds healed, it is most likely that the Triceratops survived the encounter and managed to overcome the Tyrannosaurus. Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that if Tyrannosaurus attacked a bull Triceratops, the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the Tyrannosaurus using its sharp horns. Tyrannosaurus is also known to have fed on Triceratops. Evidence for this includes a heavily tooth-scored Triceratops ilium and <b>sacrum.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} other {{skeletal}} features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are {{not considered to be}} synapomorphies. For example, as diapsids, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of temporal fenestrae (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the snout and lower jaw. Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated scapula, or shoulder blade; a <b>sacrum</b> composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in Herrerasaurus); and a perforate acetabulum, or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in Saturnalia, for example). Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.|$|E
5|$|All the {{vertebrae}} {{were highly}} pneumatised by invading air sacs, {{except for the}} atlas bone and the hindmost tail vertebrae, and were thereby connected to the respiratory system. The back vertebrae were as pneumatised as those of sauropod dinosaurs, and had an extensive system of depressions. These adaptations may be correlated with gigantism, as they reduce weight. The six vertebrae of the <b>sacrum</b> were also tall and pneumatised, and all but the first one were fused together at the top, their neural spines forming a neural plate. The ilium, the top hip bone, was also partially pneumatised close to the sacral vertebrae. Part of the pelvis was hypertrophied (enlarged) compared to other ornithomimosaurs, to support {{the weight of the}} animal with strong muscle attachments. The front hip bones tilted upwards in life. The tail of Deinocheirus ended in at least two fused vertebrae, which were described as similar to the pygostyle of oviraptorosaurian and therizinosauroid theropods. Ornithomimosaurs are known to have had pennaceous feathers, so this feature suggests that they might have had a fan of feathers at the tail end.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus {{had nine}} {{vertebrae}} in the neck, 14 in the back, and {{five in the}} <b>sacrum</b> supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus. Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), {{but these are not}} common findings, and they may have ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.|$|E
5|$|In reptiles, {{features}} of the scales are important in distinguishing among species and groups of species. In the Noronha skink, the supranasal scales (located above the nose) are in contact, as are the prefrontal scales (behind the nose) in most individuals. The two frontoparietal scales (above and slightly behind the eyes) are not fused. Unlike in T.maculata, the parietal scales (behind the frontoparietals) are in contact with each other. There are four supraocular scales (above the eyes) in almost all specimens and five supraciliary scales (immediately above the eyes, below the supraoculars). The dorsal scales (on the upperparts) have three keels, two fewer than in T.maculata. There are 34 to 40 (mode 38) midbody scales (counted around the body midway between the fore- and hindlimbs), 58 to 69 (mode 63–64) dorsal, and 66 to 78 (mode 70) ventral scales (on the underparts). Mabuya species and T.maculata generally have fewer midbody scales (up to 34). There are 21 to 29subdigital lamellae under the fourth toe, more than in T.maculata, which has 18. The Noronha skink has 26presacral vertebrae (located before the <b>sacrum),</b> similar to most Trachylepis, but unlike American Mabuya, which have at least 28.|$|E
5|$|M. browni, M. harriesi, and M. schwarzi {{were all}} {{found in the}} Upper Elliot Formation of Cape Province, South Africa. All three are based on fragmentary material, and were {{regarded}} as indeterminate {{in the most recent}} review. M. browni is based on two cervical, two back, and three caudal vertebrae and miscellaneous hind limb elements. M. harriesi is known from a well-preserved forelimb and parts of a hindlimb. M. schwarzi is known from an incomplete hind limb and <b>sacrum.</b> M. hislopi and M. rawesi were named from fossils found in India. M. hislopi is based on vertebrae from the Upper Triassic Maleri Formation of Andhra Pradesh, whereas M. rawesi is based on a tooth from the Upper Cretaceous Takli Formation of Maharashtra. M. hislopi was tentatively retained as an indeterminate sauropodomorph in the latest review, but M. rawesi may be a theropod or nondinosaur. M. huenei is a combination derived by Cooper for Lufengosaurus huenei, as he considered Lufengosaurus and Massospondylus to be synonyms. This synonymy is no longer accepted.|$|E
5|$|The dodo {{had about}} {{nineteen}} presynsacral vertebrae (those {{of the neck}} and thorax, including three fused into a notarium), sixteen synsacral vertebrae (those of the lumbar region and <b>sacrum),</b> six free tail (caudal) vertebrae, and a pygostyle. The neck had well-developed areas for muscle and ligament attachment, probably to support the heavy skull and beak. On each side, it had six ribs, four of which articulated with the sternum through sternal ribs. The sternum was large, but small {{in relation to the}} body compared to those of much smaller pigeons that are able to fly. The sternum was highly pneumatic, broad, and relatively thick in cross-section. The bones of the pectoral girdle, shoulder blades, and wing bones were reduced in size compared to those of flighted pigeon, and were more gracile compared to those of the Rodrigues solitaire, but none of the individual skeletal components had disappeared. The carpometacarpus of the dodo was more robust than that of the solitaire, however. The pelvis was wider than that of the solitaire and other relatives, yet was comparable to the proportions in some smaller, flighted pigeons. Most of the leg bones were more robust than those of extant pigeons and the solitaire, but the length proportions were little different.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of A. atacis {{is a group}} of three connected dorsal vertebrae. Cervical vertebrae are uncommon from Bellevue {{and most of them are}} poorly preserved. The vertebrae are opisthocoelous, with centra that lengthen toward the rear. Neural spines have been preserved on the vertebrae, and they face toward the rear. Two dorsal vertebrae were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened distally and narrows downwards. The vertebrae also have an internal structure that is spongy, with very large cells. The caudal vertebrae are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the caudal vertebrae are very narrow and very tall and point toward the rear. The middle caudal vertebrae are more compressed on the sides that the others. Also, the centrum of middle caudal vertebrae is longer proportionally. Two sacral vertebrae were known from Bellevue. They are poorly preserved, and are thought to belong to a juvenile. A complete <b>sacrum</b> was also found in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of the feet and legs varies greatly among frog species, depending in part on whether they live primarily on the ground, in water, in trees or in burrows. Frogs {{must be able to}} move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators, and numerous adaptations help them to do so. Most frogs are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestors that were, with much of the musculoskeletal morphology modified for this purpose. The tibia, fibula, and tarsals have been fused into a single, strong bone, as have the radius and ulna in the fore limbs (which must absorb the impact on landing). The metatarsals have become elongated to add to the leg length and allow frogs to push against the ground for a longer period on take-off. The illium has elongated and formed a mobile joint with the <b>sacrum</b> which, in specialist jumpers such as ranids and hylids, functions as an additional limb joint to further power the leaps. The tail vertebrae have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside the pelvis. This enables the force to be transferred from the legs to the body during a leap.|$|E
5|$|The Stonesfield Slate {{material}} {{contains no}} neck vertebrae; {{but a single}} broken anterior cervical vertebra is known from the New Park Quarry, specimen BMNH R9674. The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised, with large pleurocoels, pneumatic excavations, on its sides. The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly opisthocoelous, with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets. They are also deeply keeled, with the ridge on the underside representing about 50% of the total centrum height. The front dorsals perhaps have a pleurocoel above the diapophysis, the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatised. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets. They have secondary joint processes, forming a hyposphene–hypantrum complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section. The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown, but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the New Park Quarry material, specimen BMNH R9677, suggests {{the presence of a}} crest on the hip area. The spines of the five vertebrae of the <b>sacrum</b> form a supraneural plate, fused at the top. The undersides of the sacral vertebrae are rounded but the second sacral is keeled; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge. The sacral vertebrae seem not to be pneumatised but have excavations at their sides. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets on both the front and rear side. They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside. The neural spines of the tail basis are transversely thin and tall, representing {{more than half of the}} total vertebral height.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sacrum</b> and Coccyx: In the US, if both {{bones are}} to be {{examined}} separate cephalad and caudad AP axial projections are obtained for the <b>sacrum</b> and coccyx respectively {{as well as a}} single Lateral of both bones.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>sacrum</b> imperium (Holy Empire) {{was first}} used under Friedrich I, {{documented}} first in 1157, but the words <b>Sacrum</b> Romanum Imperium, Holy Roman Empire, were only combined in July 1180 and would never consistently appear on official documents from 1254 onwards.|$|E
25|$|A nearly {{complete}} <b>sacrum</b> consisting of six vertebrae was {{recovered from the}} quarry, originally only lacking some ribs. The original description of Huabeisaurus suggested that only five sacral vertebrae were present {{based on the number}} of sacral ribs and intercostal foramina. The <b>sacrum</b> is currently heavily restored with plaster, but pre-restoration photographs show the <b>sacrum</b> in two oblique dorsal views and right lateral view. These photographs reveal that the last dorsal vertebra was taphonomically shifted posteriorly and to the right, crushing the right first sacral rib. Pre-restoration photographs and the number of broken sacral neural spines currently visible indicate that the <b>sacrum</b> was composed of at least six vertebrae. The first vertebra crushed into the <b>sacrum</b> could represent a seventh sacral vertebra; because the ribs of this dorsal vertebra are not observable firsthand or in photographs, but it cannot be verified whether or not these ribs contacted the ilium. The vertebra was interpreted as the last dorsal vertebra because: its neural spine does not appear to be fused to the neural spine posterior to it, and the usual sacral vertebral count for all but the most basal somphospondylans is six (with seven vertebrae in Neuquensaurus as the only derived exception).|$|E
