40|$|This work {{presents}} a sensibility {{analysis for the}} journal bearings of combustion engines mass balancing systems. Applying it, it's possible to improve the journal bearings and avoid possible failures. This analysis consists on studying {{the effects of the}} variation of the journal bearings main parameters (radial clearance, journal bearing diameter and journal bearing length) on the journal bearings operating conditions (minimum film thickness, maximum pressure and power loss). The analysis also includes the comparison and selection of the different metallic materials {{that can be used in}} these journal bearings, as well as the selection <b>of</b> the <b>lubrication</b> system <b>groove</b> suitable for the journal bearings used in this kind of application. This sensibility analysis shows that: increasing the radial clearance, the minimum film thickness increases, the maximum pressure remains approximately the same and the power loss decreases; increasing the journal bearing length, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases; increasing the journal bearing diameter, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases. At last, it's found that the white metals (Babbitts) are considered the most advantageous and indicated materials for these journal bearings, and that the <b>lubrication</b> system <b>grooves</b> should be circumferential.

The accurate recognition <b>of</b> <b>lubrication</b> errors, such as coating not being applied properly or damaged during material handling, {{is very important to}} the quality of the final product in fastener manufacture. Lubrication errors lead to increased forging loads and premature tool failure, as well as to increased defect sorting and the re-processing of the coated rod. The lubrication coating provides a barrier between the work material and the die during the drawing operation; moreover it needs be sufficiently robust to remain on the wire during the transfer to the cold forging operation. In the cold forging operation the wire undergoes multi-stage deformation without the application <b>of</b> any additional <b>lubrication.</b> Four types <b>of</b> <b>lubrication</b> errors, typical to production of fasteners, were introduced to a set of sample rods, which were subsequently drawn under laboratory conditions.

The reasons of occurrence the fatigue crumbling on external bearing races at different stages development of working surface damage have been investigated. The basic constructions of support of shaft for the aviation gas turbine engine and methods <b>of</b> their <b>lubrication</b> have been considered. Shortcomings of existing methods <b>of</b> <b>lubrication</b> <b>of</b> bearing supports have been marked.

In the current engines, the nature <b>of</b> <b>lubrication</b> usually remains hydrodynamic at mid-stroke whilst a mixed regime <b>of</b> <b>lubrication</b> may be experienced at and near reversals. The direct contact between the tips {{of some of the}} asperities of opposing surfaces leads to mixed (partial) regime <b>of</b> <b>lubrication.</b> A model proposed by Greenwood and Tripp can be used to predict asperity level contribution to the total piston friction. At the same time Reynolds equation can be employed to predict the portion of load carried by the lubricant trapped between the asperities. Friction between the asperity tips is usually proportional to the load that they support; stated in terms of a proportionality factor; i. e. coefficient of friction. The surfaces are usually furnished with hard wear resistant coatings and in parts by solid lubricants. Both the piston rings and cylinder liner surfaces are usually coated. These coatings change the friction characteristics of the counterfaces because of their surface topography as well as material mechanical properties. AFM is used to obtain surface topographical parameters in contact tapping mode. The corresponding surface topographical parameters are obtained from representative regional areas of the contacting solid surfaces, using a Talysurf. The combination of topography and coating characteristics are used to develop the necessary parameters for a boundary friction model. A numerical model of the top compression ring to cylinder liner is developed based on mixed-hydrodynamic regime <b>of</b> <b>lubrication.</b> The results for friction and the effect of coating on the power loss and wear of the conjunction are discussed in the paper...|$|R
