30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} {{an investigation of the}} fiber content variations in concrete being discharged from a ready-mix truck at the construction site. Concrete samples were extracted from the truck drums at the beginning, middle and end <b>of</b> <b>discharge.</b> Subsequently, fibers in each sample were separated from the concrete, and weighed. Presumably, synthetic macro fibers will float towards the top, i.e. towards the drum opening, of the inclined, revolving truck-drum, while, on the other hand, steel fibers will tend to gravitate towards the lower parts of the mixer drum. Accordingly, the discharge batch, containing synthetic macro fibers, will contain a higher amount of synthetic fibers per unit volume at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> than the average unit volume fiber content of the mix, and the content will gradually decrease further down the batch. The <b>discharge</b> batch <b>of</b> steel fiber concrete will contain fewer fibers per unit volume at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> than the average unit volume fiber content of the mix, and the content should gradually increase further down the batch. The correctness of the foregoing is partly confirmed. A certain percentage of the truck loads did not comply with the proposed requirements, mainly steel fiber reinforced batches, indicating the necessity of a code or guideline amendment. A change in the Norwegian shotcrete directive was made in 2011, based upon experimental research work (2010), which, in combination with the subsequent University of Life Sciences report (2012), constitutes the foundation of this article.|$|R
