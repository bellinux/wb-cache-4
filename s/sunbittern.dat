5000|$|When {{seen as a}} gruiform, the kagu is {{generally}} considered related to the extinct adzebills from New Zealand and the <b>sunbittern</b> from Central and South America. Recent studies do indicate that the <b>sunbittern</b> is the closest living relative of the kagu. For example, Fain & Houde found these to be certainly sister taxa. They and the mesites did not group with traditional Gruiformes in their study, but instead with their proposed clade Metaves, which also includes the hoatzin, pigeons, Caprimulgiformes, flamingos, tropicbirds, Apodiformes, sandgrouse and grebes. The internal structure of this group was not well resolvable by their data, although later studies confirmed a close relationship between the kagu and <b>sunbittern.</b> [...] The kagu and <b>sunbittern,</b> and possibly the adzebills, seem to form a distinct Gondwanan lineage of birds, possibly one order, possibly more, though the relationships between them and groups previously considered related, such as the mesites and the [...] "core Gruiformes," [...] are not yet resolved. It is notable, however, that the <b>sunbittern</b> and the mesites possess powder down too, whereas the [...] "core Gruiformes" [...] do not.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sunbitterns</b> {{are one of}} 12 {{species of}} birds in five {{families}} that {{have been described as}} fishing using baits or lures to attract prey to within striking distance. This type of behaviour falls within the commonly definition of tool use. In <b>sunbitterns</b> this behaviour has only been observed in captive birds so far.|$|R
50|$|Its nest is {{a flimsy}} {{platform}} of twigs built {{high in a}} tree. It has been recorded harassing <b>sunbitterns</b> nesting in the same tree.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sunbitterns</b> start nesting in {{the early}} wet season and before it starts they make flight {{displays}} 10-15 m high in the forest canopy. They build open nests in trees, and lay two eggs with blotched markings. The young are precocial, but remain in the nest for several weeks after hatching.|$|R

5000|$|Family Rhynochetidae (kagu) - {{prospective}} [...] "Metaves" [...] - {{new order}} Eurypygiformes together with <b>sunbittern</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>sunbittern</b> (Eurypyga helias) is a bittern-like bird of {{tropical}} {{regions of the}} Americas, and the sole {{member of the family}} Eurypygidae (sometimes spelled Eurypigidae) and genus Eurypyga. It is found in Central and South America, and has three subspecies. The <b>sunbittern</b> shows both morphological and molecular similarities with the kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus) of New Caledonia, indicating an gondwanic origin, both species being placed in the clade Eurypygiformes.|$|E
50|$|The kagu and <b>sunbittern</b> are one another's closest relatives. It {{had been}} {{proposed}} (Cracraft 2001) {{that they and}} the recently extinct adzebills (family Aptornithidae) from New Zealand constitute a distinct Gondwanan lineage. However, <b>sunbittern</b> and kagu {{are believed to have}} diverged from one another long after the break-up of Gondwanaland and the adzebills are in fact members of the Grues (Houde et al. 1997, Houde 2009). The seriemas and bustards represent distinct lineages within neoavian waterbirds.|$|E
50|$|The R. J. Reynolds Forest Aviary recreates the hot, humid {{conditions}} of a tropical forest. It displays {{more than three}} thousand tropical plants and allows visitors to walk among 35 species of free-flying tropical bird including, <b>sunbitterns,</b> victoria crown pigeons and Chilean flamingos as well as red-footed and yellow-footed tortoises. Since 2007, the aviary has also been home to four species of poison dart frogs. The Aviary was listed among the top 10 American habitat exhibits in the US by USA Today.|$|R
50|$|The {{bones of}} the tail have not been {{preserved}} in any known specimen, but comparison with related species suggest it was short with a small, plowshare-shaped pygostyle bone, to which the tail feathers anchored. A mass of muscles, called the rectorial bulb, probably was present to control the fanning of the trail feathers. The tail feathers were long, with symmetrical vanes. There were at least 10 tail feathers (rectrices), more than in other primitive fan-tailed birds. The overall shape of the tail was rounded and wedge-shaped when viewed from above; due to the symmetrical feathers, {{the sides of the}} tail were probably not held fully fanned into the wind but swept back, forming a partially fanned wedge, as in some modern birds like accipiters, tyrant flycatchers and <b>sunbitterns.</b>|$|R
50|$|Eurypygimorphae is a clade {{of birds}} that {{contains}} the orders Phaethontiformes (tropicbirds) and Eurypygiformes (kagu and <b>sunbittern)</b> recovered by genome analysis the relationship was first identified in 2013 based on their nuclear genes. Historically these birds were placed at {{different parts of the}} tree, with tropicbirds in Pelecaniformes and the kagu and <b>sunbittern</b> in Gruiformes, though in the last decade various genetic analysis had found in the almost obsolete clade Metaves of uncertain placement within that group. Their sister taxon is possibly Aequornithes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sunbittern</b> {{is usually}} {{placed in the}} Gruiformes, but this was always {{considered}} preliminary. Altogether, the bird is most similar to another bird that was provisionally placed in the Gruiformes, the kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus). Molecular studies seem {{to confirm that the}} kagu and <b>sunbittern</b> are each other's closest living relatives and have a similar wing display. They are probably not Gruiformes (though the proposed Metaves are just as weakly supported). Altogether, the two species seem to form a minor Gondwanan lineage which could also include the extinct adzebills and/or the mesites, and is of unclear relation to the Gruiformes proper. Notably, the kagu and mesites also have powder down.|$|E
50|$|Based on a whole-genome {{analysis}} of the bird orders, the kagu and <b>sunbittern</b> (Eurypygiformes) and the three species of tropicbirds (Phaethontiformes) together styled as the Eurypygimorphae are the closest sister group of the Aequornithes in the clade Ardeae.|$|E
50|$|Indoor {{rainforest}} {{that housed}} golden lion tamarin, cotton top tamarin, spider monkey, howler monkey, Cuban amazon, andean tinomou, vine snake,green anaconda, angelfish, red-bellied piranha, toco toucan, <b>sunbittern,</b> emerald tree boa, two-toed sloth, shovel nosed catfish, redtail catfish, and bats.|$|E
50|$|A {{subtropical}} greenhouse, {{consisting of}} a Tropical Rainforest part and a desert part. In addition to enclosures for cottontop tamarin, toco toucan and Aldabra giant tortoises, it also has many free-ranging birds, including Cape thick-knee, lilac-breasted roller, African jacana, <b>sunbittern</b> and brown-hooded kingfisher.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{found in}} the area include: the golden-green woodpecker, the <b>sunbittern,</b> the king vulture, the {{undulated}} tinamou, the green ibis, the harpy eagle, the white-necked jacobin, the white-throated toucan, the red-and-green macaw, the red-throated caracara, the muscovy duck, the agami heron, etc.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sunbittern</b> was {{formerly}} treated as two species (E. helias and E. major), {{but now they}} are treated as a single species with considerable variation between the subspecies. The three subspecies are recognised on the basis of plumage characters and size. The three subspecies are allopatric.|$|E
5000|$|The Eurypygiformes' affinities are not {{too well}} resolved. They are two {{families}} from a Gondwanan lineage of birds. Suggested by some morphological characteristics they were initially classed {{as members of the}} family Ardeidae and later the Gruiformes. According to Jarvis, et al.'s [...] "Whole-genome analyses resolve early branches in the tree of life of modern birds", the group is distantly related to the Phaethontiformes.When seen as a gruiform, the kagu is generally considered related to the extinct adzebills from New Zealand and the <b>sunbittern</b> from Central and South America. Recent studies do indicate that the <b>sunbittern</b> is the closest living relative of the kagu. For example, Fain & Houde found these to be certainly sister taxa and Furo et al. indicated a close phylogenetic relationship them by cytotaxonomy, they suggest that their common ancestor was separated by the Gondwana vicariance in South America and New Caledonia, respectively. They and the mesites did not group with traditional Gruiformes in their study, but instead with their proposed clade Metaves, which also includes the hoatzin, pigeons, Caprimulgiformes, flamingos, tropicbirds, Apodiformes, sandgrouse and grebes. The internal structure of this group was not well resolvable by their data, and contains numerous groupings which not otherwise corroborated (such as Caprimulgidae and flamingos). The usefulness and monophyly of [...] "Metaves" [...] is therefore unclear. Notwithstanding, the kagu and <b>sunbittern</b> - and possibly the adzebills - seem to form a distinct Gondwanan lineage of birds, possibly one order, possibly more, even though the relationships between them, the mesites, and the [...] "core Gruiformes" [...] are not yet resolved. It is notable, however, that the <b>sunbittern</b> and the mesites possess powder down too, whereas the [...] "core Gruiformes" [...] do not.|$|E
5000|$|Eurypygiformes is {{an order}} {{formed by the}} kagus, {{comprising}} two species in the family Rhynochetidae endemic to New Caledonia, and the <b>sunbittern</b> (Eurypyga helias) from the tropical regions of the Americas. [...] Its closest relatives {{appear to be the}} tropicbirds of the tropical Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans.|$|E
50|$|The chestnut-mandibled toucan is most {{commonly}} seen {{when it is}} raining or foggy on the river. Parakeets can sometimes be seen after the Dos Montanas canyon. Other common birds of the area are the orependula (oriel), king fisher, tiger and blue heron, hawks, osprey, king vulture, <b>sunbittern</b> and snowy egret.|$|E
50|$|The aviary {{contains}} over 60 {{species in}} a walk-through building. One section is a cage-less room where birds fly free. Species {{in the exhibit}} include the Caribbean flamingo, scarlet ibis, rhinoceros hornbill, Bali mynah, king vulture, rockhopper penguin, Gentoo penguin, the whooping crane and <b>sunbittern,</b> as well as various pigeons and herons.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sunbittern</b> consumes a {{wide range}} of animal prey. Insects form an {{important}} part of the diet, with cockroaches, dragonfly larvae, files, katydids, water beetles and moths being taken. Other invertebrate includes crabs, spiders, shrimps and earthworms. They will also take vertebrate prey including fish, tadpoles, toads and frogs, eels and lizards.|$|E
5000|$|Jarvis, et al.'s 2014 paper [...] "Whole-genome {{analyses}} resolve early {{branches in}} {{the tree of life}} of modern birds" [...] aligns the Phaethontiformes most closely with the <b>sunbittern</b> and the kagu of the Eurypygiformes, with these two clades forming the sister group of the [...] "core water birds", the Aequornithes, and the Metaves hypothesis abandoned.|$|E
50|$|Caribbean flamingo, scarlet ibis, golden lion tamarin, cotton top tamarin, spider monkey, howler monkey, Cuban amazon, {{hyacinth}} macaw, scarlet macaw, golden collared macaw, andean tinomou, vine snake, blue poison dart frog, green anaconda, angelfish, red-bellied piranha, toco toucan, <b>sunbittern,</b> emerald tree boa, tree boa, boa constrictor, dwarf caiman, jaguar, ocelot, two-toed sloth, military macaw, andean condor, caracara, thick-billed parrot, hawkheaded parrot, sun conure.|$|E
50|$|The Free Range Aviary is home {{tropical}} forest dwelling birds such as pink pigeon, mountain peacock-pheasant, ringed teal, silver-eared mesia, scarlet-chested parrot, pheasant pigeon, Gouldian finch, <b>sunbittern,</b> common emerald dove, Victoria crowned pigeon, speckled mousebird, and mountain bamboo partridge. Within the aviary are some enclosed animal exhibits that {{are home to}} animals such as scarlet macaws and golden-headed lion tamarins.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sunbittern</b> has a {{long and}} pointed bill that is black above, and a short hallux as in {{shorebirds}} and rails. In the South American subspecies found in lowlands east of the Andes, the upperparts are mainly brown, and the legs and lower mandible are orange-yellow. The two other subspecies are greyer above, and their legs and bill are sometimes redder.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, mesites {{have been}} {{allied with the}} doves and the dippers. While the latter is {{certainly}} incorrect, there is some indication that they might indeed be closer (though not very close) to the Columbiformes. The purported gruiforms kagu and <b>sunbittern</b> (and possibly the extinct adzebills too) might also be not-too-distant relatives. These latter taxa, remarkably, were all only tentatively placed in the Gruiformes, and are apparently all of Gondwanan origin; like the mesites, the kagu and <b>sunbittern</b> are among the rather few birds possessing powder down. Still, the data hinting at a possible relationship between the [...] "odd gruiforms" [...] (and possibly pigeons) {{is by no means}} robust enough to draw a firm conclusion. (Fain & Houde 2004) Arguably, they might be considered an order of their own (Mesitornithiformes) as has on occasion been done in the past, but unlike with the hoatzin, little phylogenetic research has yet been conducted on mesites.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{analysis}} of DNA sequence data - notably β-fibrinogen intron 7 - Fain and Houde considered {{the families of}} the Caprimulgiformes to be members of the proposed clade Metaves, which also includes the hoatzin, tropicbirds, sandgrouse, pigeons, kagu, <b>sunbittern,</b> mesites, flamingos, grebes and swifts and hummingbirds. This clade was also found by the expanded study of Ericson et al. (2006), but support was extremely weak.|$|E
50|$|About 520 {{bird species}} have been {{reported}} in the park including: the blue-headed macaw, Spix's guan, the bat falcon, the red-bellied macaw, the <b>sunbittern,</b> the spangled cotinga, the king vulture, the white-necked jacobin, Chapman's swift, the ocellated poorwill, the pygmy antwren, the white-throated toucan, the jabiru, the golden-tailed sapphire, the Amazon kingfisher, the harpy eagle, the red-necked woodpecker, the scarlet macaw, the Amazonian royal flycatcher, etc.|$|E
