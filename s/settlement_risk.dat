Urban risks in Section D of Sweet Home Farm informal settlement in the City of Cape Town were examined through the lenses of community risk assessment (CRA) and household survey methodologies conducted sixteen months apart. The results described a risk profile for the study site, which {{was similar to that}} of many of Cape Town's informal settlements. However, there was more concern over chronic "everyday" threats, such as the disposal of solid waste and crime, rather than fire and flood, which are prioritised by the City.

40|$|When Medicare liens are {{involved}} in personal injury settlements, Medicare has been likened to an “ 800 -pound gorilla” at the negotiations table. Any significant Medicare lien can dominate settlement negotiations because the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) statute grants Medicare a firstpriority right to prompt reimbursement for all pre-settlement conditional payments and wields the threat of double-damages for failing to fully consider Medicare’s interests. If the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) continues the trend of extending the MSP statute’s reach, Medicareeligible recipients of personal injury <b>settlements</b> <b>risk</b> losing much more of their settlement proceeds, not only to satisfy existing Medicare liens, but also to pay for future medical expenses {{that would otherwise be}} covered by Medicare.

50|$|One form of <b>settlement</b> <b>risk</b> {{is foreign}} {{exchange}} <b>settlement</b> <b>risk</b> or cross-currency <b>settlement</b> <b>risk,</b> sometimes called Herstatt risk after the German bank {{that made a}} famous example of the risk. On 26 June 1974, the bank's license was withdrawn by German regulators {{at the end of}} the banking day (4:30pm local time) because of a lack of income and capital to cover liabilities that were due. But some banks had undertaken foreign exchange transactions with Herstatt and had already paid Deutsche Mark to the bank during the day, believing they would receive US dollars later the same day in the US from Herstatt's US nostro. But after 3:30 pm in Germany and 10:30 am in New York, Herstatt stopped all dollar payments to counterparties, leaving the counterparties unable to collect their payment. The closing of Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1990 did not cause similar problems because the Bank of England had set up a special scheme which ensured that payments were completed. Barings in 1995 resulted in minor losses for counterparties in the foreign exchange market because of a specific complexity in the ECU clearing system.|$|E

This chapter describes {{the emergence of}} national and international central securities depositories (CSDs) and the systems of tiered account-based security ownership they support. It examines clearing and <b>settlement</b> <b>risks,</b> including principal risk now largely removed by DVP, and liquidity risk reduced but far from fully removed by multilateral netting. Liquidity demand and the complexity of some underlying transactions results in a surprisingly high volume of postponed settlements (trade fails). Systems of clearing and settlement were resilient during the crisis of 2008, but the remarkable complexity of these networks suggests two policy concerns that need further examination. Problems in clearing and settlement could still magnify or transmit systemic financial risk in a future crisis, if firms do not again obtain public sector support; and the sheer complexity of clearing and settlement arrangements may both create operational risks and heighten barriers to entry, hence reducing competition and raising costs to investors. © 2016, IGI Global.

5000|$|Central {{counterparty}} clearing, {{also referred}} to as central counterparty (CCP), is a financial institution that provides clearing and settlement services for trades in foreign exchange, securities, options and derivative contracts. A clearing house stands between two clearing firms (also known as member firms or participants). Its purpose is to reduce the risk a member firm failing to honor its trade settlement obligations. A CCP reduces the <b>settlement</b> <b>risks</b> by netting offsetting transactions between multiple counterparties, by requiring collateral deposits (also called [...] "margin deposits"), by providing independent valuation of trades and collateral, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the member firms, and in many cases, by providing a guarantee fund {{that can be used to}} cover losses that exceed a defaulting member's collateral on deposit. The advantages of a central counterparty clearing arrangement are greater transparency of the risks, reduced processing costs, and greater certainty in cases of default by a member.Once a trade has been executed by two counterparties, it is submitted to a clearing house, which then steps between the two original traders' clearing firms and assumes the legal counterparty risk for the trade. For example, a trade between member firm A and firm B becomes two trades: A-CCP and CCP-B. This process is called novation.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 3rd century, barbarian raids devastated Normandy. Traces {{of fire and}} hastily buried treasures bear {{evidence}} {{to the degree of}} insecurity in Northern Gaul. Coastal <b>settlements</b> <b>risked</b> raids by Saxon pirates. The situation was so severe that an entire legion of Sueves was garrisoned at Constantia (in the pagus Constantinus), the administrative center of the Unelli tribe. Batavi were garrisoned at Civitas Baiocasensis (Bayeux [...] ). As a result of Diocletian’s reforms, Normandy was detached from Brittany, while remaining within Gallia Lugdunensis. Christianity began to enter the area during this period: Saint Mellonius was supposedly ordained Bishop of Rouen in the mid-3rd century. In 406, Germanic and Alan tribes began invading from the West, while the Saxons subjugated the Norman coast. Eventually in 457, Aegidius established the Domain of Soissons in the area (with its seat the town of the same name Soissons, formerly the seat of the Suessiones), independent of and cut off from the Empire but with citizens nevertheless still considering themselves Roman. His son Syagrius succeeded him in 464 and remained until the kingdom was conquered in 486. Rural villages were abandoned and the remaining [...] "Romans" [...] confined themselves to within urban fortifications.
