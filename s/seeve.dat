25|$|Rivers in the area, {{beside the}} {{numerous}} small heathland streams, include the Wümme, which rises {{on the western}} slopes of the Wilseder Berg, in the south the Lachte with its tributary the Lutter, and the Aller, the Vissel, the Böhme, the Grindau, the Meiße and the Örtze. They all belong to the Weser river system. Those flowing into the Elbe are the Aue, the Ilmenau, the Luhe and the <b>Seeve.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{ridges of}} end moraine on the Luheheide have clearly defined slopes that fall away sharply to the Elbe Valley. The heath is deeply incised {{by all the}} rivers that drain northwards to the Elbe; rivers such as the <b>Seeve,</b> Aue, Luhe (Ilmenau). The ridges between them are wooded and sparsely populated. Settlements are crowded {{together}} in the valleys. There is hardly any heathland left in this area, it has been largely reforested by pines.|$|E

40|$|The {{economically}} successful {{operation of}} partly mechanized small scale mines in Ghana could {{fill the gap}} between large scale, industrial and foreign controlled mining operations and the artisanal (or "galamsey") small scale operations which use only manual labour and simple tools and are mainly confined to alluvial gold deposits and on limited scale to hard rock occurrences. The need to initiate and operate partly mechanized small scale mines stems from the existence of many small orebodies spread all over Ghana which are in their extent and amount of available ore reserves {{too small to be}} of interest to medium or large scale mining companies. In this presentation one of these small auriferous orebodies is described and the operation of a small mine is outlined. The employed mining methods during start up and throughout production phases are described. Special attention is given to safety aspects of such operations. A mechanised plant for crushing and grinding the ore in preparation for gravity separation (sluicing) was set up by using locally obtainable or manufactured crushing, <b>seeving</b> and milling equipment. The extraction results over 6 month operation are presented and discussed. The total investment for the small mine and the production costs are presented giving an overview on the economics for such operation. Factors to be observed to safeguard a small mine from causing adverse environmental effects are discussed. Finally, an outlook in respect of multiplication of such operations in Ghana is presented...|$|R
