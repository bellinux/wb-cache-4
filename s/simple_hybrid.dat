This strategy avoids the overhead of recursive calls that do little or no work, and may also allow the use of specialized non-recursive algorithms that, for those base cases, are more efficient than explicit recursion. A general procedure for a <b>simple</b> <b>hybrid</b> recursive algorithm is short-circuiting the base case, also known as arm's-length recursion.

For example, in a tree, rather than recursing to a child node and then checking if it is null, checking null before recursing; this avoids half the function calls in some algorithms on binary trees. Since a D algorithm eventually reduces each problem or sub-problem instance to a large number of base instances, these often dominate the overall cost of the algorithm, especially when the splitting/joining overhead is low. Note that these considerations do not depend on whether recursion is implemented by the compiler or by an explicit stack.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Taking as {{inspiration}} {{the hybrid}} logic HL(↓), we {{introduce a new}} family of logics that we call memory logics. In this article we present in detail two interesting members of this family defining their formal syntax and semantics. We then introduce a proper notion of bisimulation and investigate their expressive power (in comparison with modal and hybrid logics). We will prove {{that in terms of}} expressive power, the memory logics we discuss in this paper are more expressive than orthodox modal logic, but less expressive than HL(↓). We also establish the undecidability of their satisfiability problems. 1 Memory Logics: Hybrid Logics with a Twist Hybrid languages have been extensively investigated in the past years. HL, the <b>simplest</b> <b>hybrid</b> language, is usually presented as the basic modal language K extended with special symbols (called nominals) to name individual states in a model. These new symbols are simply a new sort of atomic symbols {i, j, k, [...] . } disjoint from the set of standard propositional variables. While they behave syntactically exactly as propositional variables do, their semantic interpretation differ: nominals denote elements in the model, instead of sets of elements. This simple addition already results in increased expressive power. For example the formula i ∧ 〈r〉i is true in a state w, only if w is a reflexive point named by the nominal i. As the basic modal language is invariant under unraveling, there is no equivalent modal formula [1]. But as we said above, HL is just the <b>simplest</b> <b>hybrid</b> language. Once nominals {{have been added to the}} language, other natural extensions arise. Having names for states at our disposal we can introduce, for each nominal i, an operator @i that allows us to jump to the point named by i obtaining the languag...|$|R

50|$|Hybrid {{automatic}} repeat request (hybrid ARQ or HARQ) is {{a combination}} of high-rate forward error-correcting coding and ARQ error-control. In standard ARQ, redundant bits are added to data to be transmitted using an error-detecting (ED) code such as a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). Receivers detecting a corrupted message will request a new message from the sender. In Hybrid ARQ, the original data is encoded with a forward error correction (FEC) code, and the parity bits are either immediately sent along with the message or only transmitted upon request when a receiver detects an erroneous message. The ED code may be omitted when a code is used that can perform both forward error correction (FEC) in addition to error detection, such as a Reed-Solomon code. The FEC code is chosen to correct an expected subset of all errors that may occur, while the ARQ method is used as a fall-back to correct errors that are uncorrectable using only the redundancy sent in the initial transmission. As a result, hybrid ARQ performs better than ordinary ARQ in poor signal conditions, but in its simplest form this comes at the expense of significantly lower throughput in good signal conditions. There is typically a signal quality cross-over point below which <b>simple</b> <b>hybrid</b> ARQ is better, and above which basic ARQ is better.|$|E
