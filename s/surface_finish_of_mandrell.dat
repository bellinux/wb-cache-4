Besides, most improvements in the processes or understanding of the physical process involved in fabrication of laser crystal rod are closely guarded as proprietary information, and specific details can be hardly found in technical journals and other literatures. The main purposes of the study are to investigate the potential of rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) process to core drill Neodymium Doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser crystal material, and to study the effect of lapping and polishing parameters on the <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> <b>of</b> the machined end faces of Nd:YAG laser rods. The effect of RUM machining parameters (spindle speed and feedrate) on surface integrity (surface roughness and opaqueness) and defects (ring marks, edge chipping size and chipping thickness) are studied. The feasible parameters to obtain the best surface roughness, opaqueness, straightness and diameter for Nd:YAG laser rod is 3000 rpm spindle speed and 5. 4 mm/min, which is at low spindle speed and high feed rate. Nd:YAG crystal reaches the saturation point at fine <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> <b>of</b> 0. 124 micron at rotational speed of 60 rpm at 11 minutes of lapping time. Whilst for polishing process, Nd:YAG laser crystal reaches the saturation point with mirror-like and flawless <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> <b>of</b> 5 nm at 23 minutes of polishing time. It is concluded that the RUM process exhibits a great potential method in producing laser crystal rods with better controlled machining condition.

In this study, surface roughness of FDM tools are drastically reduced by a post processing technique called chemical treatment process. <b>Surface</b> <b>finish</b> was improved by filling the gap between layers by diffusion of parent material. Thus FDM made tools can be used as direct as well as indirect tools after the chemical treatment.
