5|$|Representing {{the first}} major change since the VB original, the VK model of 1984 {{introduced}} a six-window glasshouse, {{as opposed to the}} previous four-window design, to make the Commodore appear larger. The revised design helped stimulate sales, which totalled 135,000 in two years. This did not put an end to Holden's monetary woes. Sales of the initially popular Camira slumped due to unforeseen quality issues, while the Holden WB series commercial vehicle range and the Statesman WB luxury models were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their age; their 1971 origins compared unfavourably with Ford's more modern Falcon and Fairlane models.|$|E
25|$|More modern {{approaches}} to playing the didgeridoo are <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> up in performances and lessons around the World.

Stab./JG 53, I./JG 53, I./KG 54, III./KG 51 and III./55 had all been withdrawn to Germany. I./KG 54 had been particularly successful, claiming thousands of vehicles, 240 aircraft and hundreds of tanks and artillery destroyed {{at a cost of}} 23 aircraft.|$|E

Designed in the 1960s the {{aircraft}} is <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> its old age and talks about replacing these aircraft has begun. One plan is to replace the Saab 105 system with the future Boeing T-X program, a joint trainer program developed by Boeing and Saab. Other option are the Brazil Embraer Super Tucano and the Swiss PC-21.|$|E
25|$|Other analgesics work {{peripherally}} (i.e., not on {{the brain}} or spinal cord). Research is <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that morphine and related drugs may indeed have peripheral effects as well, such as morphine gel working on burns. Recent investigations discovered opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons. A significant fraction (up to 60%) of opioid analgesia can be mediated by such peripheral opioid receptors, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, traumatic or surgical pain. Inflammatory pain is also blunted by endogenous opioid peptides activating peripheral opioid receptors.|$|E
25|$|Road steam {{disappeared}} through {{restrictions and}} charges that drove up their operating costs. Through 1921, steam tractors had demonstrated clear economic advantages over horse power for heavy hauling and short journeys. However, petrol lorries were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> better efficiency {{and could be}} purchased cheaply as war surplus; on a busy route a 3-ton petrol lorry could save about £100 per month compared to its steam equivalent, in spite of restrictive speed limits, and relatively high fuel prices and maintenance costs.|$|E

25|$|The Peugeot 104 {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} European small cars of the 1970s but it was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> its age against more modern rivals by the turn of the 1980s. When Peugeot launched the stylish all-new 205 in 1983, the 104 was withdrawn from most European markets, including Britain. But it continued in France as a budget choice until production finally ceased in May 1988 after 16 years in which time 1,624,992 Peugeot 104s had been built. 345,849 of these were the short wheelbase Coupé versions.|$|E
25|$|Forecasts for the medium- and {{long-term}} remain highly positive. Peru's real GDP growth in 2007 was (8.3%) and largest in Latin America in 2008 was an outstanding 9.8%, {{the highest in}} the world. Inflation remained low, at about 3%, while the budget surplus is expected to remain at about 1% of GDP. Private investment should keep growing at a rate of 15% a year. Exports and imports are expected to keep rising. The unemployment and underemployment indexes (5.2% and 34%, respectively, in Lima) should keep coming down as the economy grows, other cities in Peru like Cajamarca, Ica, Cuzco and Trujillo are <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> less unemployment nowadays. The country is likely to attract future domestic and foreign investment in tourism, agriculture, mining, petroleum and natural gas, power industries and financial institutions.|$|E
25|$|The 19th century {{ideas of}} natural {{selection}} by Darwin and Mendelian genetics were put together with population genetics, early in the twentieth century. The modern synthesis also addressed {{the relationship between the}} broad-scale changes of macroevolution seen by palaeontologists and the small-scale microevolution of local populations of living organisms. The synthesis was defined differently by its founders, with Ernst Mayr in 1959, G. Ledyard Stebbins in 1966 and Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1974 offering differing numbers of basic postulates in their definitions, though they all included natural selection, working on heritable variation supplied by mutation. Other major figures in the synthesis included E. B. Ford, Bernhard Rensch, Ivan Schmalhausen, and George Gaylord Simpson. An early event in the modern synthesis was R. A. Fisher's 1918 paper on mathematical population genetics, but William Bateson, and separately Udny Yule, were already <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> how Mendelian genetics could work in evolution in 1902.|$|E

25|$|By the {{midpoint}} of the 2009 season, things had improved both on and off field for Melbourne. They had secured a record number of members, re-merged with the MCC, knocked-off more debt and were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> some fight on field. Players such as Liam Jurrah had begun to emerge as top young talents and were catching the eye of the footballing public. However, {{on the eve of the}} Round 14 clash against West Coast, influential president Jim Stynes announced that he had cancer, this evoked a very emotional response from the footballing public and the club lifted from three embarrassing defeats the weeks before to convincingly beat West Coast in front of a passionate MCG crowd. At the end of the season, Melbourne finished 16th on the ladder and for a second year in a row won no more than four games which granted them a Priority Pick in the National Draft. Melbourne therefore had picks 1 and 2 in the draft to build on their young talent. At the end of the season fan favourites Russell Robertson, Matthew Whelan and Paul Wheatley announced that they would no longer be playing for Melbourne in 2010 and beyond. During September 2009, midfielder Brock McLean asked to be a traded and a deal involving Carlton's pick 11 in the National Draft was agreed to.|$|E

Despite this, the album is the highest charting Ramones album of all time, reaching number 44 on the US Billboard 200 chart, and number 14 on the UK Albums Chart.

500|$|Austin Boosinger at Adventure Gamers {{said that}} the {{gameplay}} changes compared to the main series were mostly superficial, resulting {{in a game that}} is similar to but worse than the main series. Neal Ronaghan at Nintendo World Report did on the other hand feel that there had been enough changes for the game to feel fresh, and said that it was possibly the best entry in the Ace Attorney series. Hilary Goldstein at IGN {{said that the}} new gameplay elements were strong additions that add variety to the game, but felt that the series was running out of steam. Steven Hopper at GameZone said that the game was very similar to previous Ace Attorney games, on good and bad, and that the Ace Attorney series was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> its age. Laura Parker at GameSpot said that the game was a [...] "successful twist" [...] on the gameplay of the previous games in the series, and that it [...] "lacked none of the magic" [...] of them.|$|E
500|$|Campbell {{began the}} 2010–11 season in goalscoring form in pre-season, scoring four {{goals in a}} {{friendly}} against Hull, and goals against Leicester City and Brighton & Hove Albion. Having forced his way into manager Steve Bruce's plans, he started the opening match of the new Premier League season, playing the full 90 minutes against Birmingham at the Stadium of Light in a 2–2 draw. He also played the full 90 minutes in Sunderland's next league outing against West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns. However, he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in Sunderland's 1–0 win against Manchester City on 29 August 2010, which sidelined him for an expected six months. Steve Bruce said [...] "It's a tragedy. But Fraizer will be back. He's a larger-than-life character. He was just <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> what he was about.

500|$|Coppel was the best-placed rider of the octet, {{as he was}} in fifteenth place overall {{overnight}} around four-and-a-half minutes down on race leader Bradley Wiggins (...) as such, the breakaway's advantage was {{not allowed}} to gather momentum and the gap remained between two and two-and-a-half minutes {{for the majority of the}} stage. [...] allowed [...] to carry out most of the work in the peloton, with Wiggins keeping an eye on their rider Cadel Evans, who had made a late-race attack the previous day and gained time back to Wiggins. Coppel, Westra and Rolland, the break initiators, then went clear again on the second-category Côte de la Vernaz, but the peloton were still closing in on them, after chasing down a group that had got clear on the climb. Vincenzo Nibali (...) remained off the front, and tried to close down the leaders. Rolland and Coppel dropped Westra on the descent from the following Col du Corbier climb, where he was eventually joined by Nibali, but the solo move that he had put in was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> as he could not stay with Westra, and was eventually caught by the -led peloton with around [...] remaining.|$|E
500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E
