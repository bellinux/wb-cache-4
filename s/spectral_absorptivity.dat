50|$|The {{characteristics}} of thermal radiation depend on various {{properties of the}} surface it is emanating from, including its temperature, its <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptivity</b> and spectral emissive power, as expressed by Kirchhoff's law. The radiation is not monochromatic, i.e., it does not consist of just a single frequency, but comprises a continuous dispersion of photon energies, its characteristic spectrum. If the radiating body and its surface are in thermodynamic equilibrium and the surface has perfect absorptivity at all wavelengths, it is characterized as a black body. A black body is also a perfect emitter. The radiation of such perfect emitters is called black-body radiation. The ratio of any body's emission relative {{to that of a}} black body is the body's emissivity, so that a black body has an emissivity of unity.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the {{radiative}} properties of personal protective clothings worn during firefighting operations by firemen. Several intervention jackets are tested coming from different Fire and Rescue Services in France. The present study focuses on the <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptivity</b> of these equipments over visible–IR domains. The <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptivity</b> in the IR range is mainly responsible for the conversion of radiative transfer coming from the flame into heat flux through the protective jacket. This work shows that the mean absorptivities of different equipments are high, close to 90 %, which penalizes the thermal protection. This study demonstrates that the colored textile has a weak effect on the radiative properties {{and then on the}} thermal protection. On the contrary, the dyeing mode can decrease the absorptivity, hence improving the thermal protection of jackets, a dyed jacket being more efficient in the present test than a jacket made of fibers dyed before weaving. Finally, this paper presents mean absorptivities based on Planck's averages for reference temperatures between 800 K and 1400 K, allowing to compare different personal protective clothings...|$|E
40|$|A {{ray tracing}} {{analytical}} tool {{has been developed}} for the simulation of spectral radiation exchange in complex systems. Algorithms are used to account for heat source spectral energy, surface directional radiation properties, and surface <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptivity</b> properties. This tool {{has been used to}} calculate the effective solar absorptivity of the geostationary operational environmental satellites (GOES) scan mirror in the calibration position. The development and design of Sounder and Imager instruments on board GOES is reviewed and the problem of calculating the effective solar absorptivity associated with the GOES hexagonal cell configuration is presented. The analytical methodology based on the Monte Carlo ray tracing technique is described and results are presented and verified by experimental measurements for selected solar incidence angles...|$|E
40|$|Volume {{absorption}} is {{a crucial}} factor to the appearance of transparent objects such as colored glass and liquids. Due to {{the involvement of the}} <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptivities</b> of materials and path lengths of lights, volume absorption can generate interesting color variations. In this paper, we model volume absorption for homogeneous transparent materials using Bouguer-Lambertian law, and render its phenomena using a spectrum-based ray tracer. Our rendered images successfully display the subtle variations of colors due to volume absorption. We also compare our approach to an RGB-based one which assigns color tristimulus values for three monochromatic wavelengths, and show that the latter approach has significant errors and is thus inadequate for rendering volume absorption. This work expands the capability of rendering natural phenomena and can be used to improve the realism of computer generated imagery...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{experimental}} {{data concerning the}} normal <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptivities</b> of the transition metals, nickel, iron, platinum, and chromium, at both room and liquid-helium temperatures in the wavelength range from 2. 5 to 50 microns. The absorptivities were derived from reflectivity measurements made relative to a room-temperature vapor-deposited gold reference mirror. The absorptivity of the gold reference mirror was measured calorimetrically, by use of infrared laser sources. Investigation of various methods of sample-surface preparation resulted {{in the choice of}} a vacuum-annealing process as the final stage. The experimental results are discussed {{on the basis of the}} anomalous-skin-effect theory modified for multiple conduction bands. As predicted, the results approach a single-band model toward the longer wavelengths. Agreement between theory and experiment is considerably improved by taking into account the modification of the relaxation time due to the photon-electron-phonon interaction proposed by Holstein (1954) and Gurzhi (1958); but, particularly at helium temperatures, the calculated curve is consistently below the experimental results...|$|R

An optical path length of 158 cms. Was used at room temperature and one of 12 eras, at that and higher temperature Optical densities ranged from 4 to 1580 atms. cms. Spectral measurements are compared with published experimental data. Band emissivities for the 4. 3, 2. 7, 2. 0 and 1. 6 micron bands of carbon dioxide and U. 7 and 2. 35 micron bands of CO obtained from spectral measurements, are presented. Correlations of band emissivities with optical density, total pressure, and temperature, using extended spectral models and an empirical band model, are given. Theoretical estimates of band overlap corrections were made for the major bands of carbon dioxide- and carbon monoxide in the 4 to 5 micron region.

40|$|A {{spectral}} selectivity surface for both solar heating and radiative cooling was proposed. It {{has a high}} <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptivity</b> (emissivity) in the solar radiation band and atmospheric window band (i. e., 0. 2 ~ 3 [*]μm and 8 ~ 13 [*]μm), {{as well as a}} low absorptivity (emissivity) in other bands aside from the solar radiation and atmospheric window wavelengths (i. e., 3 ~ 8 [*]μm or above 13 [*]μm). A type of composite surface sample was trial-manufactured combining titanium-based solar selective absorbing coating with polyethylene terephthalate (TPET). Sample tests showed that the TPET composite surface has clear {{spectral selectivity}} in the spectra of solar heating and radiation cooling wavelengths. The equilibrium temperatures of the TPET surface under different sky conditions or different inclination angles of surface were tested at both day and night. Numerical analysis and comparisons among the TPET composite surface and three other typical surfaces were also performed. These comparisons indicated that the TPET composite surface had a relative heat efficiency of 76. 8 % of that of the conventional solar heating surface and a relative temperature difference of 75. 0 % of that of the conventional radiative cooling surface, with little difference in cooling power...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{utilization of}} infrared radiation {{is dependent on}} the spectral characteristics of the material being processed and on how well the spectral output of the infrared source matches those of the material being heated. Very little bas been published on the spectral emission of industrial infrared sources, and almost nothing has been reported on the <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptivity</b> of textiles. This information is needed to allow optimal utilization of infrared radiation. A study conducted to characterize the infrared spectral absorption characteristics of textiles as a function of important parameters such as fabric type, color, fiber type, moisture content, etc., will be discussed. An FT-IR spectrometer with an integrating sphere was used to measure the infrared absorptivity of fabrics over the wavelength spectrum of 0. 7 to 25 microns (the range of operation of commercial infrared emitters). Since the operating ranges for several system components (detectors, beam splitters and sources) are much narrower than the broad spectrum desired, the spectrum was divided into four regions, and different components were selected for operation in each of the regions. The information generated in this investigation is useful in matching IR emitters with applications in the textile industry, allowing optimization of IR heating processes with respect to energy utilization and productivity...|$|E
40|$|Coral surface {{temperature}} was investigated with multiple temperature sensors mounted on hemispherical and branching corals under (a) artificial lighting and controlled flow; (b) natural sunlight and controlled flow; and (c) {{in situ conditions}} in a shallow lagoon, under naturally fluctuating irradiance, water flow, and temperature. Under high irradiance and low flow conditions, hemispherical corals were 0. 6 uC warmer than the surrounding water. Hemispherical corals reached higher temperatures than branching corals, by a measure of 0. 2 uC to 0. 4 uC. Microsensor temperature measurements showed {{the presence of a}} thermal boundary layer (TBL). The TBL thickness was flow dependent, and under low flow conditions, a TBL up to 3 mm thick limited heat transfer to the ambient water. Combined microsensor measurements of temperature and oxygen showed that the TBL was approximately four times thicker than the diffusive boundary layer, as predicted from heat and mass transfer theory. A simple conceptual model describes coral {{surface temperature}} as a function of heat fluxes between coral tissue, skeleton, and surroundings. The slope of the predicted linear relationship between coral temperature and solar irradiance is fixed by the efficiencies of light absorption and the heat losses to the skeleton and the water. Although <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptivity</b> may {{play a significant role in}} coral warming, shape-related differences in thermal properties can cause hemispherical corals to reach higher temperatures than branching corals. Shape-relate...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{analytical}} calculation {{based on}} a transfer matrix method for incoherent optics, allowing the prediction of photovoltaic module efficiencies in different encapsulation conditions is presented. This approach {{is used for the}} experimental validation of the main features of the optical model for multilayer glazing systems considered, through the relation between the external quantum efficiency of the module and its optical modeling. The theoretical procedure avoids the need to manufacture and characterize by solar simulator or external quantum efficiency measurements all the variety of photovoltaic module configurations, which is of interest at research and manufacturing levels, especially for building-integrated photovoltaics. The absorptivity of encapsulated solar cells is not directly accessible from direct air-bare cell or airencapsulated cell optical measurements, and therefore analytical or numerical methods are generally needed. The calculations presented in this work provide closed analytical expressions for the layer-bylayer absorption of the different components of a photovoltaic module. From a small set of experimental measurements of a particular encapsulation configuration, and the theoretical expressions for <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptivities,</b> the short-circuit current of a module can be predicted for any other encapsulation scheme. It will be proved that the method accurately matches short-circuit current density of the modules as obtained from experimental measurements. Results will be presented for crystalline silicon and CIGS thin film cell technologies with several glass and encapsulation material combinations. European Commission´s FP...|$|R
40|$|Low-resolution <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptivities</b> {{have been}} {{experimentally}} determined for water vapour, {{carbon dioxide and}} carbon monoxide in the near infra-red. The gases were contained in a "test" cell located within an electric furnace and surrounded by a pressure vessel containing inert nitrogen {{at the same pressure}} as the "test" gas. Thermal radiation from a Nernst filament enters and leaves the "test" cell and pressure vessel through infra-red transmitting windows, and the attenuated radiation is detected and analysed with respect to wavelength. The absorption bands studied were the 1. 9 mum and 2. 7 bands of water vapour, the 2. 0 mum, 2. 7 mum and 4. 3 mum bands of carbon dioxide and the 2. 35 mum band of carbon monoxide. Gas pressures were varied from 1 to 8 bar, temperatures from ambient (293 K) to 900 K and the mole fractions of the absorbing gas, in a mixture with nitrogen, ranged from 0. 1 to 1. 0. The radiation path length, as indicated by the length of the "test" cell, was 15. 0 cm at ambient and 9 - 3 cm at all temperatures. Hence, absorber gas concentrations were 0. 4 to 112 bar. cm. STP. Total absorptivity were calculated for all the absorption bands studied, and correlation equations developed to relate the band absorptivity with the gas partial pressure, total pressure, temperature and radiation path length. The accuracy and applicability of each of the correlations was determined as a result of comparisons with experimental data. The effects of mixtures of carbon dioxide and water vapour on spectral and band absorption have been commented on...|$|R
50|$|Real objects never {{behave as}} full-ideal black bodies, and instead the emitted {{radiation}} {{at a given}} frequency is {{a fraction of what}} the ideal emission would be. The emissivity of a material specifies how well a real body radiates energy as compared with a black body. This emissivity depends on factors such as temperature, emission angle, and wavelength. However, it is typical in engineering to assume that a surface's <b>spectral</b> emissivity and <b>absorptivity</b> do not depend on wavelength, so that the emissivity is a constant. This is known as the gray body assumption.|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{is one of}} the {{two main}} heat {{transfer}} processes in transporting energy from flames to a surface. The other process is convection and was not considered in this report. The <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptivity</b> of 72 products was measured in the wavelength region 0. 3 - 20 mm. This wavelength region contains virtually all radiation energy from a fire. Based on the measurements, and on the theory for radiative heat transfer, the effective absorptivity for fire induced heat radiation for the different products were calculated. These typically lies in the range 0. 75 - 0. 95. It was also found that the effective absorptivity varies significantly with the temperature of the heat source. The {{reason for this is that}} the spectrum of the emitted radiation from a heat source, such as a fire, changes with temperature. This has limited effect on the heating of a surface. The dependence of the effective absorptivity on heat source temperature is important when the absorptivity is used as input for calculations of ignition temperature and thermal inertia. Using existing models for predicting ignition temperature and thermal inertia, and correcting these models with the new information on effective absorptivity, it could be shown that the effects were significant but not very large. It was considered that the uncertainties in the model are so high that corrections for the effective absorptivity might be of minor importance compared to the other uncertainties and assumptions. An interesting observation was that the absorptivity of radiation from fires for products exposed to irradiation in the cone calorimeter decreased with increased exposure time, that is, the absorptivity decreased when the products darkened due to heat. This is surprising since, for example, wood that is darkened when exposed to heat obviously has a higher absorptivity in the visual part of the spectrum than fresh non-darkened wood. This is an important observation since it opposes the general view that heat transfer increases with increased thermal exposure due to darkening Finally, it was concluded that none of the studied materials showed a particularly low absorptivity in the infrared region and therefore none of the products stands out as particularly good reflector of radiation from fires. Several ideas were presented for how such spectrally tailored surfaces, with low absorptivity for radiation from fires, can be produced...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work {{performed}} was to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel bi-layer selective emitter. Selective emitters are incandescent radiant bodies with emissivities that are substantially larger in a selected part of the radiation spectrum, thereby significantly shifting their radiated spectral distribution {{from that of a}} blackbody radiating at the same temperature. The major research objectives involved answering the following questions: (1) What maximum VIS/NIR radiant power and emissivity ratios can be attained at 2650 K? (2) What is the observed emitter body life and how does its performance vary with time? (3) What are the design tradeoffs for a dual heating approach in which both an internally mounted heating coil and electrical resistance self-heating are used? (4) What are the quantitative improvements to be had from utilizing a bi-layer emitter body with a low emissivity inner layer and a partially transmissive outer layer? Two approaches to obtaining selective emissivity were investigated. The first was to utilize large optical scattering within an emitter material with a spectral optical absorption that is much greater within the visible spectrum than that within the NIR. With this approach, an optically thick emitter can radiate almost as if optically thin because essentially, scattering limits the distance below the surface from which significant amounts of internally generated radiation can emerge. The performance of thin emitters was also investigated (for optically thin emitters, spectral emissivity is proportional to <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptivity).</b> These emitters were fabricated from thin mono-layer emitter rods as well as from bi-layer rods with a thin emitter layer mounted on a substrate core. With an initially estimated energy efficiency of almost three times that of standard incandescent bulbs, a number of energy, economic and environmental benefits such as less energy use and cost, reduced CO{sub 2 } emissions, and no mercury contamination was initially projected. The work performed provided answers to a number of important questions. The first is that, with the investigated approaches, the maximum sustained emitter efficiencies are about 1. 5 times that of a standard incandescent bulb. This was seen to be the case for both thick and thin emitters, and for both mono-layer and bi-layer designs. While observed VIS/NIR ratios represent improvements over standard incandescent bulbs, it does not appear sufficient to overcome higher cost (i. e. up to five times that of the standard bulb) and ensure commercial success. Another result is that high temperatures (i. e. 2650 K) are routinely attainable without platinum electrodes. This is significant for reducing material costs. A novel dual heating arrangement and insulated electrodes were used to attain these temperatures. Another observed characteristic of the emitter was significant grain growth soon after attaining operating temperatures. This is an undesirable characteristic that results in substantially less optical scattering and spectral selectivity, and which significantly limits emitter efficiencies to the values reported. Further work is required to address this problem...|$|E

The close collocation of the radiative and microphysical measurements, above, beneath, and inside the cirrus, is accomplished by using a research aircraft (Learjet 35 A) {{in tandem with the}} towed sensor platform AIRTOSS (AIRcraft TOwed Sensor Shuttle).

The radiative transfer simulations were applied to quantify the impact of cloud particle properties such as crystal shape, effective radius r eff, and optical thickness τ on cirrus spectral optical layer properties. Furthermore, the radiative effects of low-level, liquid water (warm) clouds as frequently observed beneath the cirrus are evaluated. They may cause changes in the radiative forcing of the cirrus by a factor of 2. When low-level clouds below the cirrus are not taken into account, the radiative cooling effect (caused by reflection of solar radiation) due to the cirrus in the solar (shortwave) spectral range is significantly overestimated...|$|R
40|$|We derive {{expressions}} for the <b>spectral</b> emissivity and <b>absorptivity</b> of acoustic radiation by low Mach number (M ≪ 1) turbulent fluids. The emissivity and absorptivity {{depend on}} {{the manner in which}} the turbulence is excited. We consider three types of turbulence. The first is free turbulence, that is, turbulence which is not subject to external forces. The second and third examples are special cases of forced turbulence, turbulence maintained by stirring with spoons and turbulent pseudoconvection. Acoustic quadrupoles are the lowest order acoustic multipoles present in free turbulence, and they control both its emissivity and absorptivity. Acoustic dipoles are created in forced turbulence, and they enhance the acoustic emissivity by M^(- 2) compared to that of free turbulence. The acoustic absorptivity of forced turbulence is quite subtle. The absorptivity of turbulence which is maintained by stirring is dominated by acoustic dipoles and exceeds that of free turbulence by M^(- 2). The dipole absorptivity of turbulent pseudoconvection is reduced by M^ 2 below that of turbulence maintained by stirring. Thus, the absorptivity of turbulent pseudoconvection is no larger than that of free turbulence. We apply our results to estimate the equilibrium energies of the acoustic modes in a box filled with fluid some of which is turbulent. For both free turbulence and turbulence maintained by stirring, the most highly excited acoustic modes attain energies E Mv^ 2, where M and v are the typical mass and velocity of an energy bearing eddy. The quality factors, or Q's, of the modes are larger by M^(- 2) in the former case than in the latter. For turbulent pseudoconvection, the most energetic acoustic modes have equilibrium energies E Mc^ 2, where c is the sound speed. Their Q's are comparable to those of modes in equilibrium with free turbulence. We evaluate the scattering of acoustic radiation by turbulent fluids. For all types of turbulence, the scattering opacity is smaller by M^ 3 than the absorptive opacity for frequencies near the peak of the acoustic spectrum. Radiation scattered by free turbulence and turbulent pseudoconvection suffers frequency shifts Δω ω. The frequency shifts are much smaller, Δω Mω, for radiation scattered by turbulence maintained by stirring. We investigate the rate at which nonlinear interactions transfer energy among the acoustic modes. If all of the fluid in the box is turbulent, this rate is slower, by M^ 3 for free turbulence, by M^ 5 for turbulence maintained by stirring, and by M for turbulent pseudoconvection, than the rate at which the individual acoustic modes exchange energy with the turbulence. If only a small portion of the fluid is turbulent, the nonlinear mode interactions can be significant, especially for modes in equilibrium with turbulent pseudoconvection. Our results have potential applications to the acoustic radiation in regions of extended turbulence which often arise in nature. In particular, they should prove useful in understanding the excitation of solar oscillations...|$|R
