Instead, the test results of this study indicated that the specific gravity of round timber and the ratio of juvenile wood are important properties to affect round timber strength. In case of small round timber like R 100, R 120, and R 140, the ratio of juvenile wood is almost 100  %. Their flexural performance was much lower than R 160 and R 180 round timber, because R 160 and R 180 has mature wood in circumferences. In other viewpoint, this means that the inner part of R 160 and R 180 round timber has relatively low-strength property. Besides, when considering stress distribution in bending, the center part of beam less contributes to the flexural performance of round timber.|$|E

The tension capacity of a tested structural timber was predicted {{as a product of}} ARF, clear wood tension strength parallel to the grain, and the area of the cross section.

The average ratio of the predicted capacity to the actual value was 1.11 with a coefficient of variation of 0.26. The average ratio obtained by using a KAR-based parameter, the clear wood area ratio (CWAR), was 2.15 with a coefficient of variation of 0.23. To study the reliability of ARF and CWAR as single parameters, the correlations of ARF and CWAR with the tension strength were determined for 57 planks. The coefficients of determination for ARF were slightly better than those for CWAR, although both of them seemed to be quite poor predictors of tension capacity when used alone.

40|$|AbstractThe bats used in Major League Baseball (MLB) are {{required}} to be turned from {{a single piece of}} wood. Northern white ash had been the wood of choice until the introduction of hard maple in the late 1990 s. Since the introduction of maple to the game, there was a perceived increase in the rate of bats to exhibit multiple piece failures (MPF) —both ash and maple. These failures introduced a new aspect to the game that can be a significant factor during play, i. e. pieces of bats going into the field of play, thereby distracting fielders while reacting to the batted ball. Observations of bat breakage in the field and lab testing of bats in controlled conditions have shown the bat durability is a function of wood quality and bat profile. Wood quality is described by the density and the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> of the wood used in the bat. The density and the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> determine the effective strength of the wood. The bat profile is described by the variation in the diameter of the bat along its length. The wood densities and bat profiles which are preferred by players, are typically in direct contradiction with what makes for a durable bat. In this paper, the finite element method is used to develop calibrated models of the breaking of wood bats in controlled lab conditions. The modeling approach is then used to explore how bat profile influences bat durability and what potential changes can be made in bat profile to satisfy player desires while increasing bat durability...|$|E
40|$|Timber as a {{construction}} material {{has been used}} for millennia, but the research field covering the prediction of the strength of structural timber is still in development. Currently, the common conception is that the determination of strength properties has to be determined for every wood species individually. By combining these strength properties to features that can be measured at the timber (either visually or by machine measurements), strength graded timber can be supplied to the market. Potentially, there are more than 1000 commercially available wood species, the timber of which can be used in structures. The largest amount of these wood species are tropical hardwoods. These wood species are often used when high strength and high durability are required. Nowadays, (tropical) timber is increasingly coming from sustainably managed forests. By application of this method of forest management, the (tropical) forests are preserved and have an economic value for the local population. A result of this approach is that more and more unknown wood species in small quantities are coming on the market, the strength properties of which have to be determined. The present methods for the determination of strength properties of a wood species require extensive testing. An extra problem is that the timber that is tested has to be representative for the timber coming on the market. All future variations in the quality of the timber coming on the market have to be covered. To {{be able to use the}} timber in structures, grading rules have to be formulated that are related to the strength properties, determined by tests. For visual grading, features like knots and <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> are used. For machine grading, for example, the density and modulus of elasticity are used. For softwoods it has been proven that machine grading is more accurate and gives higher yields in the higher strength classes in comparison with visual grading. For tropical hardwoods, a major problem for visual grading is that the most important feature for the mechanical properties, the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain,</b> is very difficult to measure in practice. For this reason, only one visual grade is defined for tropical hardwoods and optimisation is not possible. A solution for abovementioned problems can be species independent strength grading, where only the influence of the measured features is taken into account, irrespective of the species. To investigate whether this would be possible, the research question dealt with in this thesis was: what are the influencing parameters for the development of species independent strength models, and can they be quantified to ensure safe, economic and sustainable use of softwoods and (tropical) hardwoods in structures ? To answer this question, a database consisting of a large number of test results from bending tests on European softwoods, temperate hardwoods and tropical hardwoods was investigated. This database was built-up in the last ten years in cooperation with the Dutch industry. Based on a literature survey, it was concluded that both the strength and stiffness of clear wood depend on the density of the timber, irrespective of the wood species. The natural variation in test values for both properties strength and stiffness are correlated. As a result, the stiffness is a good predictor of the strength for clear wood. Based on structural mechanics, mathematical models were formulated describing the reduction of strength and stiffness caused by the presence of knots and grain angle deviation. Because the density defines the maximum possible basic strength of the timber species, independent strength grading by visual grading is not possible. For some softwood species and temperate hardwoods, the grow ring width can be a measure for the density. For the majority of hardwood timber, there is no significant correlation. The examination of the visual measurement of the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> has revealed that it is very difficult to accurately estimate the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> for tropical hardwoods before a destructive bending test. As a consequence, the variation in strength properties between test samples from the same wood species can be very large. To determine the strength of timber brought on the market under the same trade name with sufficient safety, a reduction factor has to be applied to the test results. Because it is not known how large the variation can be in the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> for tropical timber brought on the market under the various trade names, it is not possible to determine this reduction factor. By means of machine strength grading it is possible to detect the variation in <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain.</b> The reduction of the stiffness (the modulus of elasticity) can be described with the same equation (the well-known Hankinson equation) as the reduction of the bending strength, only with other constant values. Because of this, the modulus of elasticity and the density are parameters that, together, can be used for machine strength grading for timber showing grain angle deviation. The reduction equation describing the strength due to the presence of knots has the same form as the reduction equation describing the stiffness due to the presence of knots, only with other constant values. Because of this, the modulus of elasticity and the density together are also the parameters suited for species independent machine strength grading of timber containing knots. Because the influence of knots and <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> on the modulus of elasticity cannot be distinguished from each other in the modulus of elasticity measurement, timber has to be divided into two groups for species independent machine strength grading: timber for which failure is induced by knots and timber for which failure is induced by <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to perform a visual assessment, to check for the group containing grain angle deviation that only knots of limited sizes are present in the timber. Furthermore, the visual check has to ensure removal of pieces with features that cannot be detected by machine readings, such as compression failures. A feature like a compression failure causes an unpredictable strength reduction and is therefore not allowed in structural timber. In practice, the modulus of elasticity can be determined in a simple manner by means of vibration measurements. On the basis of mathematical relationships between on the one hand the features knots and <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> and on the other hand the density and the modulus of elasticity, it is possible to formulate prediction models of the strength based on the measured density and modulus of elasticity of a piece. The values for the bending strength, the modulus of elasticity and the density for the standardized strength classes are related to timber with a moisture content of 12 %. Correction factors have been derived to be able to adjust the test result of timber tested with a different moisture content to this reference moisture content, For structural sizes, no adjustments with regard to the reference sizes are necessary. The shape of the scatter around the prediction lines is theoretically derived on the basis of the distribution of the prediction values. The shape of the scatter turns out to be different for the prediction model for timber containing knots and for the prediction model for timber containing grain angle deviation. A method to derive the shape of the scatter on the basis of available data has been formulated and verified. To actually grade timber, "settings" have to be determined. These are limit values for the prediction values that determine which strength class the timber can be assigned to. The strength values of timber can only be verified on the basis of the properties of a sample that is tested destructively. For small numbers of pieces in a sample, the characteristic values of a strength grade can vary significantly between tested samples. To overcome this problem, a method was developed which takes into account the distribution of the prediction values and the scatter of the prediction model. The characteristic strength value of a strength grade for the required probability can be determined by it, irrespective of the number of pieces in a sample. With the developed prediction models it is possible to perform species independent strength grading. Especially for tropical hardwoods, the assigned strength classes can be determined in a reliable way and the yield in the higher strength classes can be increased. The research results contribute to an economic, safe and sustainable application of timber in structural applications. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

A field experiment was conducted in 2009 to determine the influence of increasing N fertilizer rates and increasing Palmer amaranth densities on weed biomass and grain sorghum biomass and yield. Three rates were 0, 67, and 134 kg N ha- 1 and natural populations of Palmer amaranth were thinned to densities of 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 plants m- 1 of row. Palmer amaranth biomass increased as weed density and N rates increased. Weed-free grain sorghum yields were similar across all three N rates, and parameter estimates of yield across Palmer amaranth densities were not different between N rates. Based on the parameter estimates from the rectangular hyperbola model, initial slope (I) as density approached zero was 16 %. Maximum expected yield loss (A) at high Palmer amaranth densities was 68 %. Palmer amaranth showed a high response to N and the higher N rate increased the ability of the weed to reduce grain sorghum yield. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the influence of six N rates on growth of six selected plant species, including grain sorghum, soybean, yellow foxtail, velvetleaf, Palmer amaranth and shattercane. Covariance analysis was performed with N rate as a covariate. Biomass of all species increased as N rate increased in both runs of the study. Soybean responded the least to N rate of all species in regards to biomass, height and leaf area production. In the first run, the biomass of three grass species (grain sorghum, yellow foxtail, shattercane) had similar estimates <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> and intercept <b>of</b> biomass across N rates.

More certainty on the underlying mechanisms of how PostDM and PostN changes over time have contributed to NUE gains or losses in modern-era hybrids can only be realized by directly comparing hybrids of different eras in the context of production-system-relevant management systems. A two-year and two-location field study was conducted in Indiana with two N rates (55 and 220 kg N ha− 1), three plant densities (54, 000, 79, 000, and 104, 000 plants ha− 1) and eight commercial hybrids that were released by a single seed company from 1967 to 2005. The main treatment effects of N rate, density, and hybrid dominated the PostDM and PostN responses, and there were no significant two-way or three-way interactions. Total dry matter at maturity gains averaged 80 kg ha− 1 year− 1 of hybrid release when averaged over locations, plant densities and N rates. Total N contents at maturity increased 0. 68 kg ha− 1 year− 1, primarily due to annual increases in grain N content (0. 8 kg ha− 1 year− 1). Post-silking N uptake rate increased 0. 44 kg ha− 1 year− 1 for these era hybrids in more favorable production site-years. <b>Slopes</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> N concentration increases per unit PostN gain were similar for all hybrids. Gains in average PFP over time were considerably higher at the low N rate (0. 9 kg ha− 1 year− 1) than at the high N rate (0. 3 kg kg− 1 year− 1). Hybrid gains in NIE were evident from 1967 to 1994, but not thereafter. The low N rate and higher plant densities also increased relative NIE and NCE values, but without hybrid interactions. There was no consistent trend of NIE or NCE gains in these hybrids primarily because grain and whole-plant N concentrations didn't decline over the decades at either N rate, and because NIE and NCE were often plant-density dependent...|$|R
30|$|The power {{index of}} {{fragment}} size distribution, αf, is simply {{reflected in the}} resulting grain size distribution for αf = 4.3. However, if αf is smaller than 3.5 (e.g., the case with αf = 2.3), the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> size distribution at a ≲ 10 − 5 cm continuously “steepens” and approaches to the slope consistent with MRN [n(a) ∝ a− 3.5] (Fig. 4). According to the analytical studies of shattering by Hellyer (1970), the power index of grain size distribution after shattering has a steady state value of ≃ − 3.5 if the size distribution of shattered fragments {{is assumed to be}} a power law with an index smaller than 4 (i.e., αf < 4) (see also Tanaka et al., 1996), although we should note that the relative velocity between grains is a complicated function of grain sizes in our case. For αf > 4, since the mass occupied by the smallest fragments is dominating, the size distribution after shattering is just dominated by the smallest fragments, keeping a power law index of −αf at small sizes.|$|E
40|$|An {{impact stress}} wave was induced {{in the end}} of 2 by 8 lumber {{containing}} knots. Rather than a normal, perpen-dicular-to-the-axis profile In transiting by a knot, the stress wave tended to lead In zones of clear wood {{in the direction of the}} <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> or slope of the an-nual rings and to lag behind the knot. Of three methods evaluated to time the stress wave, the "average " timing method was more consistent than other methods In flagging the 6 -inch length containing a knot from adja-cent clear wood S-Inch lengths. Stress wave modulus of elasticity (ESW) calculated from the data tended to be lowest with the average timing method. All ESW's were higher than ESS (static bending modulus of elasticity); however, the two types of modui tended to approach each other as knots were removed by ripping away suc-cessive 3 / 4 -inch strips down to a specimen width of I- 314 -inches. The results of this study should provide guidance In establishing stress wave methods for machine grading of lumber...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two main}} {{non-destructive}} methods of grading timber: visual and machine grading. The properties of timber as a natural material depend on the wood species, growth conditions, time of wood-cutting, storing, and the way of treating. In construction the structural and non-structural use of timber is distinguished and grading timber by visual or mechanical properties is used. Machine grading is non-destructive method, based on relationship between characteristic properties and strength of individual element. Visual grading is the oldest non-destructive method, which is still very common in practice {{and is based on}} visual inspection [...] In European Union there is no unique standard for visual grading, only an European standard EN 518 with the grading requirements for national standards was adopted. It contains demands which national standards must follow as well as the limits for timber properties. The following properties should be controlled: knots, <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain,</b> density, fissures, geometrical characteristics, biological and other characteristics. As main part of this work, the comparison between limits of timber properties and determination methods in Nordic, British and German standards were studied...|$|E

Hysteresis between heating and cooling data was observed for all of the Gd(, 2) O(, 3) and MgTi(, 2) O(, 5) specimens, and for the Al(, 2) O(, 3) specimens having the largest grain size. The observed hysteresis is attributed to the opening of microcracks during cooling and to crack closure during heating;A theoretical model was developed to describe T(,MB), the temperature at which microcracking begins, as a function <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> size. The Cleveland-Bradt equation for critical grain size was also extended so that it could be compared to the model developed in this study. For each of the three materials studied, the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> T(,MB) versus <b>grain</b> size agreed relatively well with that predicted by the model, to within a multiplicative constant of about 1. 7162.

40|$|AaS'TaACT: A {{barchan dune}} was {{constructed}} of quartz sand, to {{which had been}} added either magnetite grains or maghemite-coated quartz grains, blown down a macadam roadway, and the fabric allowed to develop. The anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility, indicative of magnetic fabric, was measured for 75 samples, representing 13 sites within the dune. The results how that the dominant fabric is controlled by simple gravitational settling but that long axis alignment is developed obliquely to the wind direction on the windward side of the dune and normal to {{the crest of the}} dune on the lee <b>slope.</b> Long axes <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> are imbricated in the wind direction. These data show that grain motion is controlled by wind on windward-sloping dune faces, whereas lee-slope alignments are produced by avalanche flow. No difference in fabric is observed between magnetite samples and maghemite-coated samples...|$|R
