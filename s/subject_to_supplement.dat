40|$|Lutein is a {{principal}} constituent of the human macular pigment. This study is composed of two projects. The first studies the conformational geometries of lutein and its potential adaptability in biological systems. The second is {{a study of the}} response of human <b>subjects</b> <b>to</b> lutein <b>supplements.</b> ^ Using semi-empirical parametric method 3 (PM 3) and density functional theory with the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G* basis set, the relative energies of s- cis conformers of lutein were determined. All 512 s-cis conformers were calculated with PM 3. A smaller, representative group was also studied using density functional theory. PM 3 results were correlated systematically to B 3 LYP values and this enables the results to be calibrated. The relative energies of the conformers range from 1 - 30 kcal/mole, and many are dynamically accessible at normal temperatures. ^ Four commercial formulations containing lutein were studied. The serum and macular pigment (MP) responses of human <b>subjects</b> <b>to</b> these lutein <b>supplements</b> with doses of 9 or 20 mg/day were measured, relative to a placebo, over a six month period. In each instance, lutein levels in serum increased and correlated with MP increases.

40|$|An {{authorisation}} system determines who is authorised {{to do what}} i. e. it assigns privileges to users and provides a decision on whether someone is allowed to perform a requested action on a resource. A traditional authorisation decision system, which is simply called {{authorisation system}} or system {{in the rest of}} the thesis, provides the decision based on a policy which is usually written by the system administrator. Such a traditional authorisation system is not sufficient to protect privacy of personal data, since users (the data subjects) are usually given a take it or leave it choice to accept the controlling organisation’s policy. Privacy is the ability of the owners or subjects of personal data to control the flow of data about themselves, according to their own preferences. This thesis describes the design of an authorisation system that will provide privacy for personal data by including sticky authorisation policies from the issuers and data <b>subjects,</b> <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> the authorisation policy of the controlling organisation. As personal data moves from controlling system to controlling system, the sticky policies travel with the data. A number of data protection laws and regulations have been formulated to protect the privacy of individuals. The rights and prohibitions provided by the law need to be enforced by the authorisation system. Hence, the designed authorisation system also includes the authorisation rules from the legislation. This thesis describes the conversion of rules from the EU Data Protection Directive into machine executable rules. Due to the nature of the legislative rules, not all of them could be converted into deterministic machine executable rules, as in several cases human intervention or human judgement is required. This is catered for by allowing the machine rules to be configurable. Since the system includes independent policies from various authorities (law, issuer, data subject and controller) conflicts may arise among the decisions provided by them. Consequently, this thesis describes a dynamic, automated conflict resolution mechanism. Different conflict resolution algorithms are chosen based on the request contexts. As the EU Data Protection Directive allows processing of personal data based on contracts, we designed and implemented a component, Contract Validation Service (ConVS) that can validate an XML based digital contract to allow processing of personal data based on a contract. The authorisation system has been implemented as a web service and the performance of the system is measured, by first deploying it in a single computer and then in a cloud server. Finally the validity of the design and implementation are tested against a number of use cases based on scenarios involving accessing medical data in a health service provider’s system and accessing personal data such as CVs and degree certificates in an employment service provider’s system. The machine computed authorisation decisions are compared to the theoretical decisions to ensure that the system returns the correct decisions...|$|R

The lipid peroxidation assay was used to assess the damage induced by oxidative stress at cell membrane level. The molecules involved in apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress, such as caspase- 3 and inducible nitric oxide synthase were also assayed by immunolocalization and western blot.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has important antioxidant effects. This study evaluated the anti-steatotic effects of n- 3 LCPUFA plus EVOO in the liver of male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> a control diet (CD) (10 % fat, 20 % protein, 70 % carbohydrate) or high fat diet (HFD) (60 % fat, 20 % protein, 20 % carbohydrate), without and with supplementation with n- 3 LCPUFA (100 mg per kg per day) plus EVOO (100 mg per kg per day) for 12 weeks. HFD induced (i) liver steatosis (increased total fat, triacylglycerols, and free fatty acid total contents), (ii) higher fasting serum glucose and insulin levels and HOMA index, total cholesterol, triacylglycerols and TNF-α and IL- 6, (iii) liver and plasma oxidative stress enhancement, (iv) depletion of the n- 3 LCPUFA hepatic content, and (v) increment in lipogenic enzyme activity and reduction in lipolytic enzyme activity. These changes were either reduced (p < 0. 05) or normalized to control the values in animals <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> HFD <b>supplemented</b> with n- 3 LCPUFA plus EVOO.

40|$|Articular chondrocytes {{experience}} low oxygen (O(2)) levels {{compared with}} many other tissues, and values fall further in disease states. Chondrocyte intracellular pH (pH(i)) is a powerful modulator of matrix synthesis and is principally regulated by Na(+) -H(+) exchange (NHE). In equine chondrocytes, NHE is inhibited when cells are incubated for 3 h at low O(2), leading to intracellular acidosis. O(2) -dependent changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels appear to underlie this effect. The present study examines whether hypoxia can influence chondrocyte NHE activity and pH(i) over shorter timescales using the pH-sensitive fluoroprobe BCECF in cells isolated not only from equine cartilage but also from bovine tissue. O(2) levels in initially oxygenated solutions gassed with N(2) fell to approximately 1 % within 2 h. A progressive fall in pH(i) and acid extrusion capacity was observed, with statistically significant effects (P < 0. 05) apparent within 3 h. For equine and bovine cell populations <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> step change in O(2) by resuspension in hypoxic (1 %) solutions, a decline in acid extrusion and pH(i) was observed within 10 min and continued throughout the recording period. This effect represented inhibition of the NHE-mediated fraction of acid extrusion.

We demonstrate that Drosophila melanogaster takes up and metabolizes isothiocyanates from radish sprouts through the detection of the metabolite sulforaphane-cysteine in fly homogenates.
