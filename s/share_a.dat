40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Department of Management of Technology for the MBA in Management of TechnologyThis research provides empirical evidence on the readiness of the banking industry of Srilanka towards <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM networks. Drawing from a contingency theory, the research posits that the credibility of <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network depends on the IT, marketing departments planning and operational department's operational procedures of respective banks. Study also reveals that the credibility of <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network and its formulation process, in turn. determine {{the effectiveness of the}} implementation of the <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network in achieving the desired performance. The causal relationships amongst these variables were then analyzed by structural equation model using LISREL 8. 80 program. ///The primary data for this study were collected through structured interviews with the mangers or higher positions of all 31 operating Srilankan banks. Study confirms the belief of the importance of an innovative culture in implementing strategic marketing planning and IT requirements of the <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network. The study also identifies that all IT, marketing and operational departments play equally important roles in planning and implementing the <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM networks between two banks. Top management support will also be a significant factor in moving to <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM networks as they are the decision makers. These findings not only support the view that it is inappropriate to separate <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM planning from its implementation aspects, but also corroborate the importance of the fit between shared ATM network and the factors supports the <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network operation. Finally, study reveals that, though resources and other factors are available within the Srilankan banks to <b>share</b> their <b>A</b> TM networks, lack of visionary leadership within the industry or within the country has delayed the emergence of <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network...|$|R
