5|$|The <b>Sinhalese</b> {{alphabet}} (Sinhalese: සිංහල අක්ෂර මාලාව) (Siṁhala Akṣara Mālāva) is an alphabet {{used by the}} <b>Sinhalese</b> {{people in}} Sri Lanka and elsewhere to write the <b>Sinhalese</b> language and also the liturgical languages Pali and Sanskrit. The <b>Sinhalese</b> alphabet, {{which is one of}} the Brahmic scripts, a descendant of the ancient Indian Brahmi script closely related to the South Indian Grantha script and Kadamba alphabet.|$|E
5|$|According to a <b>Sinhalese</b> {{primary source}} Culavamsa, a warlord or {{minister}} named Aryacakravarti invaded the <b>Sinhalese</b> capital of Yapahuwa {{on behalf of}} the Pandyan king Maaravarman Kulasekaran between the years 1277–1283 and took the politically significant Buddha’s tooth relic.|$|E
5|$|By the 9th century CE, {{literature}} {{written in}} <b>Sinhalese</b> script had emerged and the script {{began to be}} used in other contexts. For instance, the Buddhist literature of the Theravada-Buddhists of Sri Lanka, written in Pali, used the <b>Sinhalese</b> alphabet.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Sri Lanka became {{independent}} in 1948, about {{sixty percent of}} government jobs were held by Tamils, who formed barely fifteen percent of the population. The elected <b>Sinhalese</b> leaders of the country saw this {{as the result of}} a British stratagem to control the majority <b>Sinhalese,</b> and deemed it a situation that needed correction by implementation of the Policy of standardization.|$|E
5|$|The caste {{structure}} of the majority <b>Sinhalese</b> has also accommodated Hindu immigrants from South India since the 13th century CE. This {{led to the emergence}} of three new <b>Sinhalese</b> caste groups: the Salagama, the Durava and the Karava. The Hindu migration and assimilation continued until the 18th century CE.|$|E
5|$|With the {{annexation}} of the Kingdom of Kandy in 1815 the British brought the whole island of Ceylon {{under their control}} and in 1829 appointed the Colebrooke–Cameron Commission to assess {{the administration of the}} island. Among the recommendations of the commission were the end of the separate administration along ethnic/cultural lines for Low Country <b>Sinhalese,</b> Kandyan <b>Sinhalese</b> and Tamils and the introduction of communal representation whereby Ceylonese members of the Legislative Council were appointed along ethnic lines. The Donoughmore Commission of 1931 introduced universal suffrage and replaced communal representation with territorial representation, thereby introducing majority (<b>Sinhalese)</b> rule. Following the 1936 state council election an all-Sinhalese Board of Ministers was established, stoking fears amongst the island's minorities about <b>Sinhalese</b> domination. Ceylon's Tamils, led by G. G. Ponnambalam, responded by demanding balanced representation (half of seats in legislature for <b>Sinhalese</b> with the remaining half for the combined minorities). When the British appointed Soulbury Commission to look into constitutional reform in 1944, Ceylon's Tamils formed the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) to represent Tamil interests.|$|E
5|$|According to anthropologists Richard Gombrich and Gananath Obeyesekere, {{the cult}} of Kali reached Sri Lanka via South India. Although Kali shrines may {{have been part of}} Tamil Hindu temples prior to 12th century CE, the <b>Sinhalese</b> Buddhist {{population}} came to revere Kali as a village demon at least by the 12th century CE. The first known Hindu temple with a shrine to Kali to become popular with the <b>Sinhalese</b> Buddhists is Munneswaram. A myth that has Kali landing at the town of Chilaw, and residing in Munneswaram, has made the temple a popular place of visit for cursing and sorcery purposes. In the early 1970s, the majority of the <b>Sinhalese</b> visitors were there for sorcery purposes, but by the 1990s more than half have been visiting the temple for general veneration purposes, demonstrating the transformation of the deity from a malevolent demigod to a mother goddess. The veneration of Kali has completely overtaken the previously popular veneration of Pattini. Since the 1960s a number of <b>Sinhalese</b> Buddhist shrines dedicated to Kali have sprung up all over the island, especially in urban areas. These are managed by <b>Sinhalese</b> priests who are trance specialists and act as intermediaries between the deity and the devotee while being possessed by the deity. The popular veneration of previously Hindu deities such as Kali and Kataragama deviyo (the latter identified with the Hindu Skanda) have fundamentally altered the rational nature of Theravada Buddhism towards the Bhakti (“Personal veneration of deity”) aspect of Hinduism. Following protests by Buddhist monks and animal rights activist, the government banned the age old custom of animal sacrifices at the Kali temple in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In May 1958, riots {{broke out}} in Sri Lanka between the <b>Sinhalese</b> and Tamil communities. Although the Sathyalingams {{received}} a tip-off {{that they had been}} targeted and managed to escape the violence, 80 <b>Sinhalese</b> rioters attacked and burned their home. Having lost their abode and all their possessions, they resettled in Colombo. In 1969 Neila returned to Kalakshetra to be trained as an instructor and to take up a postgraduate diploma course. She graduated in 1972 with a distinction and was appointed a dance teacher with Kalakshetra.|$|E
5|$|It was remade {{into four}} other Indian languagesDrushyam (2014) in Telugu, Drishya (2014) in Kannada, Papanasam (2015) in Tamil, Drishyam (2015) in Hindi, and Dharmayudhaya (2017) in <b>Sinhalese.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since the 1950s {{the cult}} of Kataragama has taken a nationalistic tone amongst the <b>Sinhalese</b> people. People visit the shrine year long, and during the annual festival {{it looks like a}} carnival. People get into trance and indulge in ecstatic rituals {{formerly}} associated with Hindus such as fire walking, Kavadi and even body piercing or hook swinging. These ecstatic rituals have carried through the island and are widely practiced. Prominent <b>Sinhalese</b> politicians such as Dudley Senanayake and Ranasinghe Premadasa have associated with the temple upkeep by building, renovation and cleaning projects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sinhalese</b> {{script was}} added to the Unicode Standard in September 1999 with the release of version 3.0.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sinhalese</b> chronicles, such as Culavamsa, Rajavaliya and {{a number}} of Sandesya chronicles, such as Kokila Sandesaya and Selalihini Sandesaya, have {{valuable}} information on the early and middle period of the kingdom, its activities and its eventual occupation by the rival Kotte Kingdom in 1450–1467. Culavamsa mentions in detail the arrival and the conquest of the <b>Sinhalese</b> capital Yapahuwa by a minister named Aryacakravarti during the period 1277 to 1283. It also mentions that the minister carried away the Budha’s relic from the capital to Pandyan Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{reformed}} legislative council, {{introduced in}} 1921 by the British, {{was based on}} principles of communal representation, which led the Tamils {{to realize that they}} were the minority ethnic group and that they should be represented by a member of their own community. It was under this communal representation that Tamil national awareness changed to national consciousness—a less passive state. They formed a Tamil political party called the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC). In the years leading to Sri Lankan independence, political tension began to develop between the majority <b>Sinhalese</b> and minority Tamil communities as the ACTC, citing the possibility of the majority <b>Sinhalese</b> adopting a dominant posture, pushed for “fifty-fifty” representation in parliament. This policy would allot half the seats in parliament to the <b>Sinhalese</b> majority and half to the minority communities: Ceylon Tamils, Indian Tamils, Muslims and others.|$|E
5|$|These {{characters}} {{come from}} three of Sri Lanka's ethnic groups: the <b>Sinhalese,</b> the Tamils and the Portuguese Burghers.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{alphabet}} {{is used by}} approximately 16,000,000 people to write the <b>Sinhalese</b> language in very diverse contexts, such as newspapers, TV commercials, government announcements, graffiti, and schoolbooks.|$|E
5|$|For Linux, the IBus, and SCIM input methods {{allow the}} use <b>Sinhalese</b> script in {{applications}} with {{support for a}} number of key maps and techniques such as traditional, phonetic and assisted techniques. In addition, newer versions of Android mobile operating system also support both rendering and input of the Sinhala script.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>Sinhalese</b> {{letters are}} curlicues; {{straight}} lines are almost completely {{absent from the}} alphabet. This is because Sinhala used to be written on dried palm leaves, which would split along the veins on writing straight lines. This was undesirable, and therefore, the round shapes were preferred.|$|E
5|$|Most phonemes of the <b>Sinhalese</b> {{language}} {{can be represented}} by a śuddha letter or by a miśra letter, but normally {{only one of them}} is considered correct. This one-to-many mapping of phonemes onto graphemes is a frequent source of misspellings.|$|E
5|$|Since 1948, {{successive}} {{governments have}} adopted policies {{that had the}} net effect of assisting the <b>Sinhalese</b> community in such areas as education and public employment. These policies made it difficult for middle class Tamil youth to enter university or secure employment.|$|E
5|$|Sinhala {{does not}} come built in with Windows XP, unlike Tamil and Hindi. However, all {{versions}} of Windows Vista and Windows 10 come with Sinhala support by default, and do not require external fonts to be installed to read <b>Sinhalese</b> script. Nirmala UI is the default Sinhala font in windows 10.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sinhalese</b> {{script is}} a Brahmi derivate, and was {{imported}} from Northern India, around the 3rd century BCE, but was influenced {{at various stages}} by South Indian scripts, manifestly influenced by the early Grantha script.|$|E
5|$|The Tenkasi Ten {{inscription}} of Arikesari Parakrama Pandya of Tinnevelly who saw {{the backs}} of kings at Singai, Anurai,' and else where, may refer to kings of Singai. Singai or Cinkainakar being the capital of Arayacakravartis and Anurai the name for any <b>Sinhalese</b> capital; it is dated between 1449/50 and 1453/4.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} one is known as Maha Devale or Maha Kovil and is dedicated to Skanda-Murugan known amongst the <b>Sinhalese</b> as Kataragama deviyo. It {{does not have a}} statute of the deity; instead it holds a Yantra, a spiritual drawing of the deity's power. Of all the shrines in the complex, it is the largest and the first that all pilgrims come to visit. Although it does not have a representation of the deity, kept in an adjoining room is a statue of Shiva also known amongst <b>Sinhalese</b> as Karanduva. Within it there is a clay arm chair known as Kalana Mandima that supposedly belonged to Kalyanagiri Swamy. It is covered by a leopard’s skin and on it has all the ceremonial instruments. To the left of the main shrine lies a smaller shrine dedicated to Hindu god Ganesha who is known as Ganapatidevio amongst <b>Sinhalese.</b> Tamils refer to him as the Manica Pillaiyar as well. It too is a small rectangular building without any decoration. To the left of Ganesha shrine stands the Vishnu Devale the shrine dedicated to Vishnu within which there is also a Buddha image. Behind this is a large Bo tree that tradition holds as sprung from the sapling of the original Bo tree in Anuradhapura, hence is very much held in high esteem by the visiting Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|Although Sri Lankan Tamils are {{culturally}} and linguistically distinct, genetic {{studies indicate that}} they {{are closely related to}} other ethnic groups in the island while being related to the Indian Tamils from South India as well. There are various studies that indicate varying degrees of connections between Sri Lankan Tamils, <b>Sinhalese</b> and Indian ethnic groups.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries the British {{recruited}} {{large numbers}} of South Indians, primarily Indian Tamils, to work in tea, coffee, rubber and coconut plantations in Ceylon. Ceylon's majority <b>Sinhalese</b> viewed Indian Tamils with deep suspicion, fearing that they would dominate the island's central highlands and ally themselves with the indigenous Ceylon Tamils, increasing the latter's political strength. Following independence from Britain in February 1948, Ceylon's <b>Sinhalese</b> dominated government introduced the Ceylon Citizenship Bill which {{had the effect of}} denying citizenship and making stateless the country's Indian Tamils, who by now accounted for 11% of the population. The bill provided for citizenship by descent or registration but both required documentary proof, something that was difficult for most Indian Tamils, many of whom were illiterate. The ACTC opposed the bill which was passed by Parliament at its second reading on 20 August 1948. Shortly afterwards Ponnambalam decided to join the United National Party (UNP) led government which caused a split in the ACTC. Eventually the ACTC dissidents, led by Chelvanayakam, E. M. V. Naganathan and C. Vanniasingam formed the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK, Federal Party) on 18 December 1949.|$|E
5|$|Most {{accepted}} Lord Shiva as {{the primary}} deity and the lingam, the universal symbol of Shiva, was consecrated in shrines dedicated to him. The other Hindu gods of the pantheon such as Murugan, Pillaiyar, Kali were also worshipped. At the village level, village deities were popular along with the worship of Kannaki whose veneration was common amongst the <b>Sinhalese</b> in the south as well. Belief in charm and evil spirits existed, {{just as in the}} rest of South Asia.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sinhalese</b> Nampota dated in {{its present}} form to the 14th or 15th century CE {{suggests}} that the whole of the Tamil Kingdom, including parts of the modern Trincomalee District, was recognised as a Tamil region by the name Demala-pattanama (Tamil city). In this work, a number of villages that are now situated in the Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Trincomalee districts are mentioned as places in Demala-pattanama.|$|E
5|$|Western {{observers}} such as James Emerson Tennent (1858) and Charles Gabriel Seligman (1911) have {{termed the}} social group Coast Veddahs, Coast Verdas or East Coast Veddas. Anthropologists have considered {{them to be}} at least partly descended from the Veddas of the interior of the island who had migrated at some unknown period in the past to the east coast, intermarrying with the local Tamils. Interior Veddas clans themselves have a number of divisions, each claiming either <b>Sinhalese,</b> Tamil, mixed, or pure Vedda lineages. Vedda identity also depends on whether these clans are hunter-gatherers or settled agriculturalists. Settled Veddas have tended {{over a period of time}} to assume <b>Sinhalese</b> or Tamil identity based on the area of residence. If considered a subdivision of Veddas, then they are by far the largest sub-group amongst the Vedda people. Residents of Eastern Province consider those who maintain a primitive life style, or are partly dependent on hunting and gathering, as Vedar without any connotations of ethnic origins.|$|E
5|$|Although Sri Lankan Tamils are {{culturally}} and linguistically distinct, genetic {{studies indicate that}} they {{are closely related to}} <b>Sinhalese</b> ethnic group in the island. The Sri Lankan Tamils are mostly Hindus with a significant Christian population. Sri Lankan Tamil literature on topics including religion and the sciences flourished during the medieval period in the court of the Jaffna Kingdom. Since the beginning of the Sri Lankan Civil War in the 1980s, it is distinguished by an emphasis on themes relating to the conflict. Sri Lankan Tamil dialects are noted for their archaism and retention of words not in everyday use in the Tamil Nadu state in India.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the battle, Elara was the king of Anuradhapura. He was a Chola prince from South India, who had {{defeated}} the <b>Sinhalese</b> ruler Asela in an invasion. Although an invader, Elara is described as a just ruler who had even patronized Buddhism. Most of the country came under this Tamil king's rule, while his rival Kavan Tissa, a Sinhala king from Ruhunu in the south of the country, organized a resistance against him. Kavan Tissa's son, Dutthagamani, ascended to the throne {{after the death of his}} father.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the March 1960 {{parliamentary}} election {{which resulted in}} a hung parliament. The new Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake tried to get ITAK's support for his minority government but refused to give into ITAK's demands to end state-sponsored colonisation of Tamil-majority areas by <b>Sinhalese,</b> regional autonomy and the rights of Indian Tamils. As a result, ITAK started negotiations with the opposition SLFP who agreed to introduce the provisions of the B-C pact as bills in parliament. During the negotiations on forming an alternate stable government Chelvanayakam informed the Governor-General that ITAK would support a SLFP government for a full term and as result the Governor-General dissolved parliament.|$|E
5|$|ITAK {{had four}} main aims: {{creation}} of a federal union in Ceylon with two states - a Tamil state in the Northern and Eastern provinces and a <b>Sinhalese</b> state in the remaining seven provinces; cessation of state-sponsored colonisation in the two Tamil provinces; unity amongst the Tamil speaking peoples of Ceylon - Ceylon Tamils, Indian Tamils and Muslims; and equal status for Sinhala and Tamil languages. Chelvanayakam lost his seat in the 1952 parliamentary election but regained it in the 1956 parliamentary election. As Ceylon's two main parties, the UNP and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), introduced policies which further discriminated against the country's minorities, such as the Sinhala Only Act which made Sinhala the sole official language of Ceylon, ITAK's Tamil nationalism became more popular than the ACTC's conservatism. In the 1956 parliamentary election the ITAK overtook the ACTC as the most popular party amongst Ceylon Tamils. On 5 June 1956 a group of Tamil activists and parliamentarians, led by Chelvanayakam, staged a satyagraha (a form of non-violent resistance) against the Sinhala Only Act on Galle Face Green opposite the Parliament. The satyagrahis were attacked by a <b>Sinhalese</b> mob as the police looked on, and ITAK MPs E. M. V. Naganathan and V. N. Navaratnam were thrown in Beira Lake.|$|E
5|$|Lynn Alton de Silva (16 June 1919 – 22 May 1982) was a Sri Lankan theologian and Methodist minister. He was {{the founder}} and editor {{of one of the}} first {{theological}} journals on Buddhist-Christian encounter called Dialogue (1961–1981), chief translator for the revision of the Old Testament of the <b>Sinhalese</b> Bible published as New Sinhala Bible (1973–1982), and director of the Ecumenical Institute for Study and Dialogue (EISD) in Sri Lanka (1962–1982). Lynn de Silva is widely {{regarded as one of the}} foremost Christian practitioners of Buddhist-Christian dialogue in Sri Lanka, and also as one of the pioneers in this dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Negombo Tamils, or Puttalam Tamils, {{are native}} Sri Lankan Tamils {{who live in}} the western Gampaha and Puttalam districts. The term does not apply to Tamil {{immigrants}} in these areas. They are distinguished from other Tamils by their dialects, one of which is known as the Negombo Tamil dialect, and by aspects of their culture such as customary laws. Most Negombo Tamils have assimilated into the <b>Sinhalese</b> ethnic group through a process known as Sinhalisation. Sinhalisation has been facilitated by caste myths and legends (see Passing (sociology)).|$|E
5|$|One of the Sinhala legends tells {{that when}} Skanda-Kumara moved to Sri Lanka, {{he asked for}} refuge from Tamils. The Tamils refused, {{and he came to}} live with the <b>Sinhalese</b> in Kataragama. As a penance for their refusal, the deity forced Tamils to indulge in body {{piercing}} and fire walking in his annual festival. This legend tries to explain the location of the shrine as well as the traditional patterns of worship by Tamils. Another Sinhala legends attests that Kataragama deviyo was the deity worshiped by Dutugamunu in the 1st century BCE, before his war with Ellalan, and that Dutugamunu had the shrine erected to Skanda-Kumara at Kataragama after his victory. This legend has no corroboration in the Mahavamsa, the historic annals about Dutugamunu. Another Sinhala legend makes Kataragama deviyo a deification of a Tamil spy sent by Elara to live amongst the <b>Sinhalese</b> or a Tamil juggler who made the locals deify him after his death. Yet another legend says that Kataragama deviyo is a deification of the legendary king Mahasena, who is born as a bodhisattva or Buddha in waiting. Anthropologists Richard Gombrich and Gananath Obeyesekere were able to identify new strands of these legends and the originators of these legends since the 1970s, with the burgeoning popularity of the shrine and its deity amongst the Sinhala Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|Tamil dialects are {{differentiated}} by the phonological {{changes and}} sound shifts in their evolution from classical or old Tamil (3rd century BCE–7th century CE). The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects form {{a group that}} is distinct from the dialects of the modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala states of India. They are classified into three subgroups: the Jaffna Tamil, the Batticaloa Tamil, and the Negombo Tamil dialects. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as the <b>Sinhalese,</b> Moors and Veddhas. Tamil loan words in Sinhala also follow the characteristics of Sri Lankan Tamil dialects.|$|E
