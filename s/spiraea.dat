5|$|In the 19th century, as {{the young}} {{discipline}} of organic chemistry began to grow in Europe, scientists attempted to isolate and purify the active components of many medicines, including willow bark. After unsuccessful attempts by Italian chemists Brugnatelli and Fontana in 1826, Joseph Buchner obtained relatively pure salicin crystals in 1828; the following year, Henri Leroux developed another procedure for extracting modest yields of salicin. In 1834, Swiss pharmacist Johann Pagenstecher discovered {{what he thought was}} a new pain-reducing substance, isolated from the common remedy of meadowsweet (<b>Spiraea</b> ulmaria). By 1838, Italian chemist Raffaele Piria found a method of obtaining a more potent acid form of willow extract, which he named salicylic acid. The German chemist who had been working to identify the <b>Spiraea</b> extract, Karl Jacob Löwig, soon realized that it was in fact the same salicylic acid that Piria had found.|$|E

Botryosphaeria australis, B. lutea, B. obtusa, B. parva, B. rhodina and a Diplodia sp. are confirmed from grapevines in South Africa, while Diplodia porosum, Fusicoccum viticlavatum and F. vitifusiforme are described as new. Although isolates of B. dothidea and B. stevensii are confirmed from grapevines in Portugal, neither of these species occurred in South Africa, nor were any isolates of B. ribis confirmed from grapevines. All grapevine isolates from Portugal, formerly presumed to be B. ribis, are identified as B. parva based on their EF 1 - equence data. From artificial inoculations on grapevine shoots, we conclude that B. australis, B. parva, B. ribis and B. stevensii are more virulent than the other species studied.

40|$|Podosphaera is a genus of the {{powdery mildew}} fungi {{belonging}} to the tribe Cystotheceae of the Erysiphaceae. Among the host plants of Podosphaera, 86 % of hosts of the section Podosphaera and 57 % hosts of the subsection Sphaerotheca belong to the Rosaceae. In order to reconstruct the phylogeny of Podosphaera and to determine evolutionary relationships between Podosphaera and its host plants, we used 152 ITS sequences and 69 28 S rDNA sequences of Podosphaera for phylogenetic analyses. As a result, Podosphaera was divided into two large clades: clade 1, consisting of the section Podosphaera on Prunus (P. tridactyla s. l.) and subsection Magnicellulatae; and clade 2, composed of the remaining member of section Podosphaera and subsection Sphaerotheca. Because section Podosphaera takes a basal position in both clades, section Podosphaera may be ancestral in the genus Podosphaera, and the subsections Sphaerotheca and Magnicellulatae may have evolved from section Podosphaera independently. Podosphaera isolates from the respective subfamilies of Rosaceae each formed different groups in the trees, suggesting a close evolutionary relationship between Podosphaera spp. and their rosaceous hosts.

Rosaceae contains nearly a hundred genera with high economic values. Yet, taxa relationship among Rosaceae has not been investigated enough and is still vague. Su et al. (2014) performed maximum likelihood analysis within Rosids using 62 conserved chloroplast genes, which suggested but with low bootstrap that P. persica and P. rupicola formed a clade while P. pyrifolia and P. utilis formed another clade. However, another ML analysis was performed using 78 protein-coding genes (Wang et al. 2013) described that P. persica and P. utilis formed a clade while P. pyrifolia and P. rupicola formed another clade. As these two studies were incongruent, we included those four genera, along with R. odorata, F. virginiana and E. japonica in our phylogenetic analysis to clarify the internal relationships within Rosaceae. Our phylogeny was similar to that of Wang et al. (2013), but with higher bootstrap values. This is also consistent with traditional studies that put Eriobotrya (loquat) and Pyrus (pear) into the subfamily Maloideae.

6000|$|As {{conspicuous}} {{deviations of}} structure occur rarely, {{the improvement of}} each breed is generally {{the result of the}} selection of slight individual differences. Hence the closest attention, the sharpest powers of observation, and indomitable perseverance, are indispensable.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2004. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In {{an attempt}} to combat some of the {{pathogens}} {{that are associated with}} trunk diseases and disorders of grapevines, research in this thesis focused on the taxonomy and pathological aspects of Coniellai/Pilidiella, Botryosphaeria and Phomopsis spp. Previously, conidial pigmentation was used to separate Pilidiella from Coniella. Recently, however, the two genera have been regarded as synonymous, with the older name, Coniella, having priority. The most important species in the Coniellai/Pilidiella complex of grapevines is C. diplodiella (Speg.) Petr. & Syd., the causal organism of white rot of grapevines. Previous studies found it difficult to distinguish between C. diplodiella and C. fragariae (Oudem.) B. Sutton, which is known to occur in soil and caused leaf diseases of Fragaria and Eucalyptus. Both these species have previously been reported from South Africa. None of the reports on C. diplodiella could be scientifically substantiated; therefore it is still a quarantine organism. However, this status has been questioned. Based on sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS 1, ITS 2), 5. 8 S gene, large subunit (LSU) and elongation factor 1 - α gene (EF l- α) from the type species of Pilidiella and Coniella, Coniella was separated from Pilidiella, with the majority of taxa residing in Pilidiella. Pilidiella is characterised by species with hyaline to pale brown conidia (avg. length: width > 1. 5), with Coniella having dark brown conidia (avg. length: width ≤ 1. 5). Pilidiella diplodiella, previously C. diplodiella, causal organism of white rot of grapevines, was shown to be an older name for C. petrakii. This fungus is present in South Africa and is therefore no longer of quarantine importance. Based on analyses of the histone (H 3) gene sequences of isolates in the P. diplodiella species complex, P. diplodiella was separated from a newly described species, P. diplodiopsis. A new species, P. eucalyptorum, is proposed for isolates formerly treated as C. fragariae, associated with leaf spots of Eucalyptus spp. This species clustered basal to Pilidiella, and may represent yet a third genus within this complex. Pilidiella destruens was newly described as anamorph of Schizoparme destruens, which is associated with twig dieback of Eucalyptus spp. in Hawaii. The genus Botryosphaeria Ces. & De Not. are known to be cosmopolitan, with broad host ranges and geographical distributions. Several saprotrophic species have been reported from grapevines, while others are severe pathogens of this host. These species include B. dothidea (Moug. : Fr.) Ces. & De Not., B. parva Pennycook & Samuels, B. obtusa (Schwein.) Shoemaker, B. stevensii Shoemaker, B. lutea A. J. L. Phillips and B. ribis Grossenb. & Duggar. Species reported from South Africa as grapevine pathogens are B. obtusa, B. dothidea, B. ribis and B. vitis (Schulzer) Sacco. In the present study, morphological, DNA sequence data (ITS 1, 5. 8 S, ITS 2 and EFI-α) and pathological data were used to distinguish 11 Botryosphaeria spp. associated with grapevines from South Africa {{and other parts of the}} world. Botryosphaeria australis, B. lutea, B. obtusa, B. parva, B. rhodina and a Diplodia sp. were confirmed from grapevines in South Africa, while Diplodia porosum, Fusicoccum viticlavatum and F. vitifusiforme were described as new species. Although isolates of B. dothidea and B. stevensii were confirmed from grapevines in Portugal, neither of these species, nor B. ribis, were isolated in this study. All grapevine isolates from Portugal, formerly presumed to be B. rib is, are identified as B. parva based on EF 1 -α sequence data. Artificial inoculations on grapevine shoots showed that B. australis, B. parva, B. ribis and B. stevensii are more virulent than the other species studied. The Diplodia sp. collected from grapevine canes was identified as morphologically similar, but phylogenetically distinct from D. sarmentorum, while D. sarmentorum was confirmed as anamorph of Otthia <b>spiraeae,</b> the type species of the genus Otthia (Botryosphaeriaceae). A culture identified as O. <b>spiraeae</b> clustered within Botryosphaeria, and is thus regarded as a probable synonym. These findings confirm earlier suggestions that the generic concept of Botryosphaeria should be expanded to include genera with septate ascospores and Diplodia anamorphs. The genus Phomopsis (Sacc.) Bubak contains many species that are plant pathogenic or saprotrophic. Ten species are known from grapevines. However, only two have been confirmed as being pathogenic, namely P. viticola (Sacc.) Sacc., causal organism of Phomopsis cane and leaf spot and P. vitimegaspora Kuo & Leu (teleomorph Diaporthe kyushuensis Kajitani & Kanem.), causal organism of swelling arm disease of grapevines. P. amygdali (Delacr.) 1. 1. Tuset & M. T. Portilla, a known pathogen from Prunus sp., was shown to be a possible pathogen of grapevines in a previous study. D. perjuncta Niessl. causes bleaching of dormant canes only and is therefore of little importance as a grapevine pathogen. Recently a number of Phomopsis isolates were obtained from grapevines in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Isolations were made from Phomopsis-like symptoms, pruning wounds and asymptomatic nursery plants. These isolates showed great variation in morphology and cultural characteristics. Earlier taxonomic treatments of Phomopsis, based species identification on host specificity, cultural characteristics and morphology. Recent studies have indicated that these characteristics can no longer be used to distinguish species of Phomopsis due to wide host ranges and morphological plasticity of some species. The use of anamorph/teleomorph relationships in species identification is also untenable, since Diaporthe teleomorphs have only been described for approximately 20 % of the known Phomopsis species. In this study morphological data, DNA sequences (ITS-I, 5. 8 S, ITS- 2) and pathogenicity data were combined to distinguish Phomopsis spp. from grapevines. Fifteen species of Phomopsis were delineated by phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequence data. Diaporthe helianthi, a sunflower pathogen, was reported from grapevines for the first time, with a further six, unknown species also distinguished. Three different clades contained isolates previously identified as D. perjuncta. Based on type studies, it appeared that the name D. viticola was available for collections from Portugal and Germany, a new species, D. australafricana, was proposed for South African and Australian isolates, formerly treated as D. perjuncta or D. viticola. An epitype specimen and culture were designated for D. perjuncta. This species was distinguished from D. viticola and D. australafricana based on morphology and DNA phylogeny. Artificial inoculations of green grapevine shoots indicated that, of the species tested, P. amygdali, a known pathogen of peaches in the USA, and P. viticola were the most virulent. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: In 'n poging om sommige patogene geassosieer met stamsiektes en syndrome, te beveg, het die navorsing in die tesis gefokus op die taksonomie en patologiese aspekte van ConiellaiPilidiella, Botryosphaeria en Phomopsis spp Voorheen is konidium pigmentasie gebruik om Pilidiella (hialien tot ligbruin konidia) van Coniella (donkerbruin konidia) te skei. Onlangs is hierdie twee genera egter as sinoniem beskou met die ouer naam, Coniella, wat voorkeur gekry het. Die belangrikste spesies in die ConiellaiPilidiella kompleks van wingerd is C. diplodiella (Speg.) Petr. & Syd., die veroorsakende organisme van witvrot van wingerd. Vorige studies het dit moeilik gevind om te onderskei tussen C. diplodiella en C. fragariae (Oudem.) B. Sutton, wat bekend is dat dit in grond voorkom en ook blaarsiektes van Fragaria en Eucalyptus veroorsaak. Beide hierdie spesies is tevore in Suid-Afrika aangemeld. Geen van die aanmeldings van C. diplodiella is egter wetenskaplik bewys nie en daarom is dit steeds 'n kwarantyn organisme. Hierdie kwarantyn status is egter bevraagteken. Op grond van DNS volgordes van die interne getranskribeerde spasieerder area ("ITS 1 ", "ITS 2 "), die 5. 8 S rRNS geen, die groot ribosomale subeenheid ("LSU") en die verlengingsfaktor 1 -α geen ("EF-lα") van die tipe spesies van Pilidiella en Coniella, is Coniella van Pilidiella geskei, met die meerderheid van die taxa wat binne Pilidiella resorteer. Pilidiella word gekarakteriseer deur spesies met hialien tot ligbruin konidia (gem. lengte: breedte > 1. 5), in teenstelling met die donkerbruin konidia van Coniella (gem. lengte: breedte ≤ 1. 5). Daar is verder bewys dat Pilidiella diplodiella, voorheen C. diplodiella, veroorsakende organisme van witvrot van wingerd, die ouer naam van C. petrakii is. Hierdie swam is teenwoordig in Suid-Afrika en P. diplodiella is dus nie meer van kwarantyn belang nie. Op grond van analises van die histoon (H 3) volgordes van spesies in die P. diplodiella spesies kompleks, is P. diplodiella geskei van 'n nuut beskryfde spesie, P. diplodiopsis. 'n Nuwe spesie, P. eucalyptorum, is ook voorgestel vir isolate voorheen beskou as C. fragariae, geassosieer met blaarvlek van Eucalyptus spp. Hierdie spesie het basaal van Pilidiella gegroepeer en mag moontlik nog 'n derde genus binne hierdie kompleks verteenwoordig. Pilidiella destruens is nuut as anamorf van Schizoparme destruens beskryf, wat geassosieer word met loot terugsterwing van Eucalyptus spp. in Hawaii. Die genus Botryosphaeria Ces. & De Not. is bekend as kosmopolitaans met 'n wye gasheerreeks en geografiese verspreiding. Verskeie saprofitiese spesies is aangemeld vanaf wingerd, terwyl ander ernstige patogene van hierdie gasheer is. Laasgenoemde spesies sluit in B. dothidea (Moug. : Fr.) Ces. & De Not., B. parva Pennycook & Samuels, B. obtusa (Schwein.) Shoemaker, B. stevensii Shoemaker, B. lutea A. 1. L. Phillips en B. ribis Grossenb. & Duggar. Spesies aangemeld in Suid-Afrika as wingerdpatogene, is B. obtusa, B. dothidea, B. ribis en B. vitis (Schulzer) Sacco In hierdie studie is morfologiese, DNS volgorde data ("ITSl", "ITS 2 ", 5. 8 S en "EF-Iα") en plantpatologiese data gebruik om II Botryosphaeria spesies, geassosieer met wingerde in Suid-Afrika en verskeie ander werelddele, te onderskei. Botryosphaeria australis, B. lutea, B. obtusa, B. parva, B. rhodina en 'n Diplodia sp. is bevestig van wingerde in Suid-Afrika, terwyl Diplodia porosum, Fusicoccum viticlavatum en F. vitifusiforme as nuwe spesies beskryf is. AIhoewel isolate van B. dothidea en B. stevensii bevestig is van wingerde in Portugal, is geen van hierdie spesies en ook nie B. ribis geïsoleer nie. AIle isolate vanaf wingerd in Portugal, voorheen beskou as B. rib is, is as B. parva op grond van hul "EF-lα" volgordes geïdentifiseer. Uit kunsmatige isolasies gemaak op wingerdlote is die gevolgtrekking gemaak dat B. australis, B. parva, B. ribis en B. stevensii meer virulent is as die ander spesies wat bestudeer is. Die Diplodia sp. versamel vanaf wingerdlote is geïdentifiseer as morfologies eenders, maar filogeneties verskillend van D. sarmentorum, terwyl D. sarmentorum bevestig is as die anamorf van Otthia <b>spiraeae,</b> die tipe spesie van die genus Otthia (Botryosphaeriaceae). 'n Kultuur wat as 0. <b>spiraeae</b> geïdentifiseer is, het binne Botryosphaeria gegroepeer, en word dus as 'n moontlike sinoniem beskou. Hierdie bevindinge bevestig vroeëre voorstelle dat die generiese konsep van Botryosphaeria uitgebrei behoort te word om genera met gesepteerde askospore en Diplodia anamorwe in te sluit. Die genus Phomopsis (Sacc.) Bubak bevat verskeie spesies wat as of plantpatogenies, of saprofities, beskryf is. Tien spesies is bekend op wingerd. Slegs twee is as patogenies bevestig, naamlik P. viticola (Sacc.) Sacc., veroorsakende organisme van loot-en-blaarvlek ("streepvlek") en P. vitimegaspora Kuo & Leu (teleomorf Diaporthe kyushuensis Kajitani & Kanem.), veroorsakende organisme van geswelde arm van wingerd. In 'n vroeëre studie is bevind dat P. amygdali (Delacr.) 1. 1. Tuset & M. T. Portilla, 'n bekende patogeen van Prunus sp., moontlik ook 'n patogeen van wingerd mag wees. D. perjuncta Niessl. veroorsaak egter net verbleiking van dormante lote en is dus van min belang as 'n wingerd patogeen. Gedurende die afgelope twee jaar is verskeie Phomopsis isolate van wingerde in die Wes-Kaap provinsie van Suid-Afrika verkry. Isolasies is gemaak van Phomopsis-agtige simptome, snoeiwonde en asimptomatiese kwekeryplante. Die isolate verkry uit hierdie materiaal het groot variasie ten opsigte van morfologie en kultuureienskappe getoon. Vroeëre taksonomiese verhandelings van Phomopsis het spesies-identifikasie op gasheerspesifisiteit, kultuureienskappe en morfologie gebasseer. Onlangse studies het egter getoon dat, weens wye gasheerreekse en morfologiese plastisiteit van somnuge spesies, hierdie eienskappe me meer gebruik kan word om Phomopsis spesies te identifiseer nie. Die gebruik van anamorflteleomorf verwantskappe in die identifikasie van Phomopsis spesies ook onbruikbaar omdat Diaporthe teleomorwe vir slegs ongeveer 20 % van die bekende Phomopsis spesies beskryf is. Die huidige studie het dus morfologiese data, DNS volgordes ("ITS 1 ", 5. 8 S, "ITS 2 ") en patogenisiteitsdata gekombineer ten einde Phomopsis spp. vanaf wingerd te identifiseer. Vyftien Phomopsis spesies is deur die filogenetiese analise van die interne getranskribeerde spasieerder area ("ITS") volgordes geskei. Diaporthe helianthi, 'n bekende patogeen van sonneblomme, is vir die eerste maal op wingerd aangeteken, terwyl 'n verdere ses, tans onbekende spesies van Phomopsis ook geidentifiseer is. Drie verskillende groepe het isolate bevat wat voorheen as D. perjuncta geidentifiseer is. Gebasseer op studies van tipes, het dit voorgekom dat die naam D. viticola beskikbaar is vir isolate uit Portugal en Duitsland. 'n Nuwe spesie, D. australafricana, is voorgestel vir Suid-Afrikaanse en Australiese isolate wat voorheen behandel is as D. perjuncta of D. viticola. 'n Epitipe monster en kultuur is vir D. perjuncta benoem. Hierdie spesie is van D. viticola en D. australafricana onderskei op grond van morfologie en DNS filogenie. Kunsmatige inokulasies van groen wingerdlote het getoon dat P. amygdali, bekende perske patogeen, en P. viticola die mees virulent was...|$|R
60|$|The gardens {{were very}} different, now. The trees had burst forth again into leaf, the <b>spiraea</b> bushes seemed {{weighted}} down with snow, {{and with a}} note {{like that of the}} quivering bass string of a 'cello the bees hummed among the fruit blossoms. And there beside me in her filmy dress was Maude, a part of it all--the meaning of all that set my being clamouring. She was like some ripened, delicious flower ready to be picked.... One of those pernicious, make-believe volumes had fallen on the bench between us, for I could not read any more; I could not think; I touched her hand, and when she drew it gently away I glanced at her. Reason made a valiant but hopeless effort to assert itself. Was I sure that I wanted her--for life? No use! I wanted her now, no matter what price that future might demand. An awkward silence fell between us--awkward to me, at least--and I, her guide and mentor, became banal, apologetic, confused. I made some idiotic remark about being together in the Garden of Eden.|$|E
60|$|After leaving Tallum, {{the valley}} contracts, passing over great ancient moraines, and again {{expanding}} wider than before into broad grassy flats. The vegetation rapidly diminishes in stature and abundance, {{and though the}} ascent to Tungu is trifling, the change in species is very great. The <b>Spiraea,</b> maple, Pieris, cherry, and larch disappear, leaving only willow, juniper, stunted birch, silver fir, white rose, Aralia, berberry, currant, and more rhododendrons than all these put together;* [Cyananthus, a little blue flower allied to Campanula, {{and one of the}} most beautiful alpines I know, covered the turfy ground, with Orchis, Pedicularis, Gentian, Potentilla, Geranium, purple and yellow Meconopsis, and the Artemisia of Dorjiling, which ascends to 12,000 feet, and descends to the plains, having a range of 11,500 feet in elevation. Of ferns, Hymenophyllum, Cistopteris, and Cryptogramma crispa ascend thus high.] while mushrooms and other English fungi* [One of great size, growing in large clumps, is the English Agaricus comans, Fr., and I found it here at 12,500 feet, as also the beautiful genus Crucibulum, which is familiar to us in England, growing on rotten sticks, and resembling a diminutive bird's nest with eggs in it.] grew amongst the grass.|$|E
60|$|On {{the flat}} were {{flowering}} a beautiful magnolia with globular sweet-scented flowers like snow-balls, several balsams, with species of Convallaria, Cotoneaster, Gentian, <b>Spiraea,</b> Euphorbia, Pedicularis, and honeysuckle. On the hill-side were creeping brambles, lovely yellow, purple, pink, and white primroses, white-flowered Thalictrum and Anemone, berberry, Podophyllum, white rose, fritillary, Lloydia, etc. On the flanks of Tukcham, {{in the bed}} of a torrent, I gathered many very alpine plants, at the comparatively low elevation of 10,000 feet, as dwarf willows, Pinguicula, (a genus not previously found in the Himalaya), Oxyria, Adrosace, Tofieldia, Arenaria, saxifrages, and two dwarf heath-like Andromedas.* [Besides these, a month later, the following flowered in profusion: scarlet Buddleia? gigantic lily, yellow jasmine, Aster, Potentilla, several kinds of orchids, willow-herb (Epilobium), purple Roscoea, Neillia, Morina, many grasses and Umbelliferae. These formed a rank and dense herbaceous, mostly annual vegetation, six feet high, bound together with Cuscuta, climbing Leguminosae, and Ceropegia. The great summer heat and moisture here favour the ascent of various tropical genera, of which I found in August several Orchideae (Calanthe, Microstylis, and Coelogyne), also Begonia, Bryonia, Cynanchum, Aristolochia, Eurya, Procris, Acanthaceae, and Cyrtandraseae.] The rocks were all of gneiss, with granite veins, tourmaline, and occasionally pieces of pure plumbago.|$|E
6000|$|Above 11,000 feet {{the valley}} expands remarkably, the {{mountains}} recede, become less wooded, and more grassy, while the stream is suddenly less rapid, meandering {{in a broader}} bed, and bordered by marshes, covered with Carex, Blysmus, dwarf Tamarisk, and many kinds of yellow and red Pedicularis, both tall and beautiful. There are far fewer rhododendrons here than in the damper Zemu valley at equal elevations, and more Siberian, or dry country types of vegetation, as Astragali of several kinds, Habenaria, Epipactis, dandelion, and a caraway, whose stems (called in Tibet [...] "Gzira") are much sought for as a condiment.* [Umbelliferae abound here; with sage, Ranunculus, Anemone, Aconites, Halenia, Gentians, Panax, Euphrasia, speedwell, Prunella vulgaris, thistles, bistort, Parnassia, purple orchis, Prenanthes, and Lactuca. The woody plants of this region are willows, birch, Cotoneaster, maple, three species of Viburnum, three of <b>Spiraea,</b> Vaccinium, Aralia, Deutzia, Philadelphus, rhododendrons, two junipers, silver fir, larch, three honeysuckles, Neillia, and a Pieris, whose white blossoms are so full of honey as to be sweet and palatable.] The Singtam Soubah and Lachen Phipun received me at the bridge (Samdong), at Tallum, and led me across the river (into Cheen they affirmed) to a pretty green sward, near some gigantic gneiss boulders, where I camped, close by the river, and 11,480 feet above the sea.|$|E
60|$|Farley Chamberlayne, which {{joins the}} wood {{on the other}} side, rising much higher, has a {{monument}} viewed from all the country round, erected {{by one of the}} St. John family to a horse which leapt down with him into a chalk-pit of considerable depth, and so alighted that neither horse nor man was hurt, and the horse won the cup at the races the year after, under the name of Beware Chalk-Pit. Parnholt wood, that clothes one side of the mount, is beloved by botanists for possessing tracts of lily of the valley, Convallaria majalis, and likewise Paris quadrifolia, a great rarity. The mount itself is bare chalk down, {154} but has a wonderful view over the whole undulating country--to the southward the beginning of forest land, and to the south-east, where the beechwoods of South Lynch begin to creep up the rapid slope of chalk, there is delightful hunting ground; for bee orchis (Ophrys apifera) swarm; careful search may discover the brown velvet blue-eyed fly, Ophrys muscifera, the quaint MAN and DWARF orchis can be found; butterfly or honey-suckle orchis, Habenaria, as we are constrained to term it, is frequent; and where the beech-trees begin there are those curious parasites which are the only plants they tolerate, the Listera Nidus-avis, birds'-nest orchis, the Monotropa Hypopitys, or yellow birds'-nest, the beautiful lily-like Epipactis Grandiflora; while helleborine and the curious and capricious tooth-wort, <b>Spiraea</b> Filipendula or drop-wort, Gentiana Amarella, and other distinctive chalk-down plants are found.|$|E
60|$|Five or {{six miles}} above Mywa, the valley {{contracts}} much, and the Tambur (whose bed is elevated about 3000 feet) becomes a turbulent river, shooting along its course with immense velocity, torn into foam as it lashes the spurs of rock that flank it, {{and the enormous}} boulders with which its bed is strewn.* [In some places torrents of stone were carried down by landslips, obstructing the rivers; when in the beds of streams, they were often cemented by felspathic clay into a hard breccia of angular quartz, gneiss, and felspar nodules.] From this elevation to 9000 feet, its sinuous track extends about thirty miles, which gives the mean fall of 200 feet to the mile, quadruple {{of what it is}} for the lower part of its course. So long as its bed is below 5000 feet, a tropical vegetation prevails in the gorge, and along the terraces, consisting of tall bamboo, Bauhinia, Acacia, Melastoma, etc.; but the steep mountain sides above are either bare and grassy, or cliffs with scattered shrubs and trees, and their summits are of splintered slaty gneiss, bristling with pines: those faces exposed to the south and east are invariably the driest and most grassy; while the opposite are well wooded. Rhododendron arboreum becomes plentiful at 5000 to 6000 feet, forming a large tree on dry clayey slopes; it is accompanied by Indigofera, Andromeda, <b>Spiraea,</b> shrubby Compositae, and very many plants absent at similar elevations on the wet outer Dorjiling ranges.|$|E
6000|$|On the 11th June, my active people {{completed}} a most ingenious bridge of branches of trees, bound by withes of willow; by which I {{crossed to the}} north bank, where I camped on an immense flat terrace at the junction of the rivers, and about fifty feet above their bed. The first step or ascent from the river is about five feet high, and formed of water-worn boulders, pebbles, and sand, scarcely stratified: the second, fully 1000 yards broad, is ten feet high, and swampy. The uppermost is fifteen feet above the second, and is covered with gigantic boulders, and vast rotting trunks of fallen pines, buried in an impenetrable jungle of dwarf small-leaved holly and rhododendrons. The surface was composed of a rich vegetable mould, which, where clear of forest, supported a rank herbage, six to eight feet high.* [This consisted of grasses, sedges, Bupleurum, rhubarb, Ranunculus, Convallaria, Smilacina, nettles, thistles, Arum, balsams, and the superb yellow Meconopsis Nepalensis, whose racemes of golden poppy-like flowers were as broad as the palm of the hand; it grows three and even six feet high, and resembles a small hollyhock; whilst a stately Heracleum, ten feet high, towered over all. Forests of silver fir, with junipers and larch, girdled these flats and on their edges grew rhododendrons, scarlet <b>Spiraea,</b> several honeysuckles, white Clematis, and Viburnum. Ferns are much scarcer in the pine-woods than elsewhere in the forest regions of the Himalaya. In this valley (alt. 10,850 feet), I found only two kinds; Hymenophyllum, Lomaria, Cystopteris, Davallia, two Polypodia, and several Aspidia and Asplenia. Selaginella ascends to Zemu Samdong (9000 feet). The Pteris aquilina (brake) does not ascend above 10,000 feet.] ...|$|E
60|$|The path lay north-west up the valley, {{which became}} thickly wooded with silver-fir and juniper; we {{gradually}} ascended, crossing many streams from lateral gulleys, and huge masses of boulders. Evergreen rhododendrons soon replaced the firs, growing in inconceivable profusion, {{especially on the}} slopes facing the south: east, and with no other shrubs or tree-vegetation, but scattered bushes of rose, <b>Spiraea,</b> dwarf juniper, stunted birch, willow, honey-suckle, berberry, and a mountain-ash (Pyrus). What surprised me more than the prevalence of rhododendron bushes, {{was the number of}} species of this genus, easily recognised by the shape of their capsules, the form and woolly covering of the leaves; none were in flower, but I reaped a rich harvest of seed. At 12,000 feet the valley was wild, open, and broad, with sloping mountains clothed for 1000 feet with dark-green rhododendron bushes; the river ran rapidly, and was broken into falls here and there. Huge angular and detached masses of rock were scattered about, and to the right and left snowy peaks towered over the surrounding mountains, while amongst the latter narrow gulleys led up to blue patches of glacial ice, with trickling streams and shoots of stones. Dwarf rhododendrons with strongly-scented leaves (R. anthopogon and setosum), and abundance of a little Andromeda, exactly like ling, with woody stems and tufted branches, gave a heathery appearance to the hill-sides. The prevalence of lichens, common to this country and to Scotland (especially L. geographicus), which coloured the rocks, added an additional feature to the resemblance to Scotch Highland scenery. Along the narrow path I found the two commonest of all British weeds, a grass (Poa annua), and the shepherd's purse! They had evidently been imported by man and yaks, and as they do not occur in India, I could not but regard these little wanderers from the north with the deepest interest.|$|E

You see, Aunt Janet, how the beautiful garden [...] inspires a danger-hardened old tramp like me to high-grade sentiments [...] of poetic fancy!

6000|$|... “Don’t talk to {{me about}} town gardens,” said Elinor Rapsley; “which means, of course, that I {{want you to listen to}} me for an hour or so while I talk about nothing else. ‘What a nice-sized garden you’ve got,’ people said to us when we first moved here. What I suppose they meant to say was what a nice-sized site for a garden we’d got. As a matter of fact, the size is all against it; it’s too large to be ignored {{altogether}} and treated as a yard, and it’s too small to keep giraffes in. You see, if we could keep giraffes or reindeer or some other species of browsing animal there we could explain the general absence of vegetation by a reference to the fauna of the garden: ‘You can’t have wapiti and Darwin tulips, you know, so we didn’t put down any bulbs last year.’ As it is, we haven’t got the wapiti, and the Darwin tulips haven’t survived the fact that most of the cats of the neighbourhood hold a parliament in the centre of the tulip bed; that rather forlorn looking strip that we intended to be a border of alternating geranium and <b>spiræa</b> has been utilised by the cat-parliament as a division lobby. Snap divisions seem to have been rather frequent of late, far more frequent than the geranium blooms are likely to be. I shouldn’t object so much to ordinary cats, but I do complain of having a congress of vegetarian cats in my garden; they must be vegetarians, my dear, because, whatever ravages they may commit among the sweet pea seedlings, they never seem to touch the sparrows; there are always just as many adult sparrows in the garden on Saturday as there were on Monday, not to mention newly-fledged additions. There seems to have been an irreconcilable difference of opinion between sparrows and Providence since the beginning of time as to whether a crocus looks best standing upright with its roots in the earth or in a recumbent posture with its stem neatly severed; the sparrows always have the last word in the matter, at least in our garden they do. I fancy that Providence must have originally intended to bring in an amending Act, or whatever it’s called, providing either for a less destructive sparrow or a more indestructible crocus. The one consoling point about our garden is that it’s not visible from the drawing-room or the smoking-room, so unless people are dinning or lunching with us they can’t spy out the nakedness of the land. That is why I am so furious with Gwenda Pottingdon, who has practically forced herself on me for lunch on Wednesday next; she heard me offer the Paulcote girl lunch if she was up shopping on that day, and, of course, she asked if she might come too. She is only coming to gloat over my bedraggled and flowerless borders and to sing the praises of her own detestably over-cultivated garden. I’m sick of being told that it’s the envy of the neighbourhood; it’s like everything else that belongs to her—her car, her dinner-parties, even her headaches, they are all superlative; no one else ever had anything like them. When her eldest child was confirmed it was such a sensational event, according to her account of it, that one almost expected questions to be asked about it in the House of Commons, and now she’s coming on purpose to stare at my few miserable pansies and the gaps in my sweet-pea border, and to give me a glowing, full-length description of the rare and sumptuous blooms in her rose-garden.” ...|$|E
