40|$|An {{increasing}} number of applications {{require the use of}} high temperature superconductors (HTS) such as (RE=Rare Earth) Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x (REBCO) coated conductors [1]. HTS conductors show particularly great potential for high field magnets applications [1] due to their high upper critical fields [2], But several groups have shown that REBCO coated conductors are prone to delamination failure [3] [4] [5]. Under relatively low transverse stress the HTS film separates from the substrate and the conductor degrades [6]. This is problematic due to high transverse stresses that occur in fully epoxy impregnated solenoids wound with this conductor. Application of thin walled heat shrink tubing introduces a weak plane around the conductor, preventing delamination degradation [7]. However, manual application of the shrink tubing is impractical, requiring three operators limited to insulating 100 m lengths or less of REBCO conductor. The high risk of damage to the conductor, also associated with this process, shows the need for a mechanized process. Strict guidelines for the capabilities of the mechanized process were set: a single operator must have the capability to insulate continuous 200 m lengths of REBCO conductor with a minimum insulation rate of 50 m per work day. This thesis presents the ideation, prototyping, and construction of such a mechanized insulation process. Results of prototyping yielded an insulation rate of 100 m per work day with two operators, and the capacity to insulate 130 m of REBCO conductor [8]. Local critical current test indicated that no damage is caused to the tape from the insulation process [9]. A final mechanized <b>Shrink</b> <b>Tube</b> Insulation Apparatus (STIA) was developed, increasing the conductor length capacity to 450 m and reducing the number of operators to one. Due to unforeseen motor and tape tension issues, modifications to STIA were required, which increased the number of operators to two. Through a collaborative effort between the Applied Superconductivity Center (ASC) and the Kyushu University in Japan, a continuous 200 m length of Fujikora-produced REBCO conductor was provided, to be insulated by STIA. An insulation rate of 100 m per work day was achieved with two operators. In the latter of the paper, current work to rectify the issues causing the need for two operators is presented...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To quantitatively {{validate}} diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) applications, {{a hardware}} phantom containing crossing fibers at a sub-voxel level is presented. It {{is suitable for}} validation of a large spectrum of DW-MRI applications from acquisition to fiber tracking, which is an important recurrent issue in the field. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phantom properties were optimized to resemble properties of human white matter in terms of anisotropy, fractional anisotropy, and T(2). Sub-voxel crossings were constructed at angles of 30, 50, and 65 degrees, by wrapping polyester fibers, with a diameter close to axon diameter, into heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubes.</b> We show our phantoms are suitable for the acquisition of DW-MRI data using a clinical protocol. RESULTS: The phantoms {{can be used to}} successfully estimate both the diffusion tensor and non-Gaussian diffusion models, and perform streamline fiber tracking. DOT (Diffusion Orientation Transform) and q-ball reconstruction of the diffusion profiles acquired at b = 3000 s/mm(2) and 132 diffusion directions reveal multimodal diffusion profiles in voxels containing crossing yarn strands. CONCLUSION: The highly purpose adaptable phantoms provide a DW-MRI validation platform: applications include optimisation of acquisition schemes, validation of non-Gaussian diffusion models, comparison and validation of fiber tracking algorithms, and quality control in multi-center DWI studies...|$|R

In plasma physics, Chui and Moffatt [Proc Roy Soc A 451, 609,(1995) ] (CM), considered non-orthogonal coordinates to investigate knotted magnetic flux tube Riemann metric. Here it is shown that, in the unstretching knotted tubes, dynamo action cannot be supported. Turbulence there, is generated by suddenly braking of torus rotation. Here, use of CM metric, shows that stretching of magnetic knots, by ideal plasmas, may support dynamo action. Investigation on the stretching in plasma dynamos, showed that in diffusive media [Phys Plasma 15, 122106,(2008) ], unstretching unknotted tubes do not support fast dynamo action.

40|$|Advances in {{information}} and network technology enable {{the development of}} "Smart Plants", which are more agile, cost-effective and operating continuously close to the market. In response to the continuously varying feedstock supply and product market demand, the process operation strategy, including setpoints and economic stage costs, needs to be frequently updated to improve the process economy. This new paradigm requires: (1) a flexible and equilibrium-independent control design method, which does not need exact information on the setpoints; (2) an optimization-based online control approach that achieves optimal operational economy during the transitions; and (3) a scalable distributed control framework for large-scale interacted networked systems. In this thesis, a systematic, flexible and scalable control design method based on contraction (a concept related to incremental stability) theory is developed. The main results include: (1) A constructive method is proposed {{to search for a}} pair of control contraction metric (CCM) and differential state feedback law for standalone systems. One advantage of the contraction-based method is that it allows for decoupling the control design from the prior knowledge of setpoints or references, which leads to an equilibrium-independent system analysis and control design approach. Another advantage is that the control synthesis can be formulated as a convex state-dependent LMI problem, which can be solved in a computational tractable way, e. g., using the sum-of-squares programming. (2) The above-proposed method is extended to distributed plantwide control by using the concept of differential dissipativity. Plantwide incremental exponential stability with respect to time-varying setpoints/references together with a bounded incremental L_ 2 gain condition for disturbance attenuation are achieved. The alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed to solve the large-scale synthesis problem in a distributed manner. (3) A distributed economic model predictive control (DEMPC) scheme is developed by using the sum-separable CCM, which can be obtained from previous plantwide control design method. An exponentially <b>shrinking</b> <b>tube</b> constraint, which is a contraction inequality derived from the CCM, is added to the DEMPC formulation. The closed-loop stability under the proposed DEMPC is independent of the setpoints/references and economic stage cost functions.

50|$|The unshrunk tubing is fitted on {{the wire}} before making the connection, then slid down to cover the joint after it is made. If the fit is tight, {{silicone}} lubricant can be applied without compromising the heat-shrink material. The tubing is then shrunk to wrap tightly around the joint by heating in an oven or with a hot air gun or other source of hot gas flow. Convenient but less consistent methods for <b>shrinking</b> the <b>tube</b> include a soldering iron held close to but not touching the tube, or the heat from a lighter. Uncontrolled heat can cause uneven shrinkage, physical damage and insulation failure, and these methods are not recommended by heatshrink suppliers. If overheated, heat-shrink tubing can melt, scorch or catch fire like any other plastic. Heating causes the tubing to contract to between half and one sixth of its original diameter, depending on the material used, providing a snug fit over irregularly shaped joints. There is also longitudinal shrinking, usually unwanted {{and to a lesser}} extent than narrowing, of typically around 6%. The tubing provides good electrical insulation, protection from dust, solvents and other foreign materials, and mechanical strain relief, and is mechanically held in place (unless incorrectly oversized or not properly shrunk) by its tight fit.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging or MRI {{is a powerful}} medical imaging technique. This non-invasive technique utilizes a strong static magnetic field and radio frequent electromagnetic waves to align the magnetic dipole moments of water molecules in the body. Images are created based on the local density of water molecules and their mutual interactions. MRI provides great contrast between soft tissues and is generally regarded to be a safe imaging method since no ionizing radiation is used. An important modality of MRI is diffusion weighted MRI (DWMRI), which provides unique biologically and clinically relevant information of water in tissues that is not available from other imaging modalities. The overall effect observed in a diffusion weighted MRI image voxel reflects, on a statistical basis, the displacement distribution of water molecules which are present in that voxel. During their random diffusion driven displacement, molecules probe tissue structure at a microscopic scale. As diffusion is a three-dimensional process, the molecular mobility is not necessarily equal in all directions, which enables the detection of tissue anisotropy. An interesting application is the diffusion anisotropy in brain white matter (WM) originating from its specific organization in bundles of more or less myelinated axonal fibres running in parallel. Assuming that {{the direction of the}} fastest diffusion indicates the overall orientation of the fibres, DW-MRI provides a way to map the spatial orientation of the white matter tracks in the brain. Fibre tractography algorithms are used to reconstruct and visualize the neural fibre tracts in the WM. DW-MRI is also useful in the diagnosis of stroke and to investigate white matter pathologies such as Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) and brain tumours. Despite the fact that the first clinical applications of DW-MRI were presented in 1986, problems with validation, quantification and interpretation of the DW-MRI data still persist. A hardware diffusion phantom serving as a gold standard for the quantitative validation of DW-MRI is crucial for clinical purposes but still not available. In addition, phantoms with a well-known anisotropic structure would be useful to develop and test fibre tractography algorithms. Moreover, the origin of the DW-MRI signal inWM is not completely understood and the contributions of the different compartments (diffusion in the intra-, extracellular space and exchange between the intra-, extracellular compartment) are elusive. A well-known physical or simulated phantom would be useful to gain more insight in this matter. In this Ph. D. dissertation, both hardware and software diffusion phantoms are presented for the validation and interpretation of DWMRI data. Hardware diffusion phantoms can be classified into isotropic and anisotropic phantoms. Isotropic phantoms contain liquids such as water. They are widely used to test diffusion sequences and to evaluate related imaging artefacts. Anisotropic phantoms are essential in order to evaluate quantitatively measured parameters expressing the anisotropy such as the diffusion tensor and the fractional anisotropy (FA). They are also useful in analysing the variability of different MR-scanners in terms of anisotropy and fibre orientation. Both biological diffusion phantoms (plants and excised spinal cord) and synthetic diffusion phantoms are used for the validation of DW-MRI. We focus here on the development of anisotropic fibre phantoms because on the one hand, they have a well-known and reproducible structure {{and on the other hand}} they can be used to imitate complex geometries such as curved fibres and fibre crossings. A fibre phantom bundle consists of parallel fibres placed in water and surrounded by a <b>shrinking</b> <b>tube</b> to pack the fibres densely. In order to investigate how the different fibre material properties, size of the fibres and packing density influence the outcome of the DW-MRI experiment, fibre bundles are created with varying fibre density and made of different fibre materials (carbon fibre, nylon fibre, Dyneema R and fibreglass). The fibre density and fibre diameter are the two major factors determining the diffusion properties such as the FA, while the SNR is mainly determined by the surface relaxation and the magnetic susceptibility of the fibre. The most appropriate fibres to manufacture diffusion phantoms turn out to be densely packed fibre bundles made from a hydrophobic material with a magnetic susceptibility close to water. Of the tested fibre materials, Dyneema R fibres show to have the best fibre characteristics for making diffusion phantoms and are used further in this work. The diffusion in the Dyneema R fibre bundles is measured using DW-MRI and bulk NMR diffusion measurements. The measured diffusion properties are compared to simulations. The diffusion coefficient and kurtosis in the interstitial space between fibres is modelled using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of random walkers. The timedependent apparent diffusion coefficient and kurtosis are simulated in geometries of parallel fibres with varying packing geometries and packing densities. The MC simulations confirm the accuracy and validity of the existing analytical models for ordered packing geometries. The simulations in the random packed fibre geometries show a higher FA and a longer diffusion transition time between the short and longtime diffusion limit in comparison with ordered packing geometries. Based on the correspondence between simulations and experimental measurements, the fibre phantoms are shown to be useful for the quantitative validation of DW-MRI on clinical MRI-scanners. Next, the MC simulations are elaborated in a geometry with intra and extracellular compartments imitating the WM. The simulations are extended to simulate the DW-MRI signal and exchange is enabled between the different compartments. The bi-exponential model and the cumulant expansion form are evaluated as models for the DWMRI signal in WM. The validity of these models is investigated by evaluation of the models as a function of the considered b-interval and considering the effect of exchange. The simulated DW-MRI signal shows to be rather pseudo-biexponential because there is a strong dependence on the diffusion time and considered b-interval. Moreover, when assuming that a biexponential function models the diffusion in two compartments, i. e. the intra- and extracellular space, this model is not straightforward interpretable in case of exchange between those compartments. The cumulant expansion form is proposed as an alternative. The diffusion coefficient and kurtosis can be accurately fitted when including higher order terms in the cumulant expansion form. The kurtosis appears to be a useful parameter to measure the exchange between the intra- and extracellular compartments. It could be potentially useful to correlate the kurtosis with the observed changes in cell permeability to cell pathological changes such as during stroke and in malignant tumours. Finally, some potential applications of Dyneema R fibre phantoms for the validation of DW-MRI are demonstrated as well in this work. As they have a well-known structure and anisotropy, they show to be suitable for sequence design, optimisation and the evaluation of imaging artefacts. Thanks to the flexibility and the variety of the <b>shrinking</b> <b>tubes,</b> an anthropomorphic head phantom containing the major WM in vivo fibre tracts can be created. In addition, a crossing fibre phantom is manufactured to test and evaluate fibre tractography algorithms...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates two {{problems}} that are discrete analogues of two harmonic analytic problems which lie {{in the heart of}} research in the field. More specifically, we consider discrete analogues of the maximal Kakeya operator conjecture and of the recently solved endpoint multilinear Kakeya problem, by effectively <b>shrinking</b> the <b>tubes</b> involved in these problems to lines, thus giving rise to the problems of counting joints and multijoints with multiplicities. In fact, we effectively show that, in R 3, what we expect to hold due to the maximal Kakeya operator conjecture, as well as what we know in the continuous case due to the endpoint multilinear Kakeya theorem by Guth, still hold in the discrete case. In particular, let L be a collection of L lines in R 3 and J the set of joints formed by L, that is, the set of points each of which lies in at least three non-coplanar lines of L. It is known that |J| = O(L 3 / 2) (first proved by Guth and Katz). For each joint x ∈ J, let the multiplicity N(x) of x be the number of triples of non-coplanar lines through x. We prove here that X x 2 J N(x) 1 = 2 = O(L 3 = 2); while we also extend this result to real algebraic curves in R 3 of uniformly bounded degree, as well as to curves in R 3 parametrized by real univariate polynomials of uniformly bounded degree. The multijoints problem is a variant of the joints problem, involving three finite collections of lines in R 3; a multijoint formed by them is a point that lies in (at least) three non-coplanar lines, one from each collection.

After pre-defined stroke in the process of energy absorption the simultaneous process of folding of the outer tube starts, so both tubes deform in parallel mode {{during the rest of the}} stroke.

This paper deals with prediction of relative solvent accessibility, given only the amino-acid sequence. In this paper, we use an improved support vector regression (SVR) and new kernels for real valued prediction of solvent accessibility. In this regard, two main issues are addressed. First we address the problem of c selection, which we found to be somewhat problematic in our earlier work (c is a parameter with significant influence on noise insensitivity and generalization of SVRs). In particular, rather than employ the standard trial and error based approach, we used an improved <b>tube</b> <b>shrinking</b> method to find c. Secondly, a novel kernel combining solvation model, electrostatic charge model and evolutionary information in the form of position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is given.

More precisely, we study geometrical {{properties of the}} solution to the so-called Rudin-Osher-Fatemi total variation denoising method. The first contribution of this paper is a precise mathematical definition of the "extended support" (associated to the noise-free image) of TV denoising. It is intuitively the region which is unstable and will suffer from the staircasing effect. We highlight in several practical cases, such as the indicator of convex sets, that this region can be determined explicitly. Our second and main contribution is a proof that the TV denoising method indeed restores an image which is exactly constant outside a small tube surrounding the extended support. The radius of this <b>tube</b> <b>shrinks</b> toward zero as the noise level vanishes, and are able to determine, in some cases, an upper bound on the convergence rate. For indicators of so-called "calibrable" sets (such as disks or properly eroded squares), this extended support matches the edges, so that discontinuities produced by TV denoising cluster tightly around the edges. In contrast, for indicators of more general shapes or for complicated images, this extended support can be larger. Beside these main results, our paper also proves several intermediate results about fine properties of TV regularization, in particular for indicators of calibrable and convex sets, which are of independent interest...|$|R

For the tube-only configuration (TOC), a micropipette is used to pull a LNT into the interior of a surface-immobilized vesicle, where the length of the tube L is determined by the distance of the micropipette to the vesicle wall. For the two-vesicle configuration (TVC), a small vesicle is inflated {{at the tip of the}} micropipette tip and the length of the tube L is in this case determined by the distance between the two interconnected vesicles. An electrochemical method monitoring diffusion of electroactive molecules through the nanotube has been used to determine the radius of the nanotube R as a function of nanotube length L for the two configurations. The data show that the LNT connected in the TVC constricts to a smaller radius in comparison to the tube-only mode and that <b>tube</b> radius <b>shrinks</b> at shorter <b>tube</b> lengths. To explain these electrochemical data, we developed a theoretical model taking into account the free energy of the membrane regions of the vesicles, the LNT and the high curvature junctions.
