To validate its potential use for national surveillance, we evaluated the robustness of <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> compared with that of PFGE based on a collection of 217 S. aureus strains representative of the Belgian S. aureus epidemiology during the last 13 years. <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> and PFGE both showed high discriminatory power (discriminatory indexes of 0. 98 and 0. 96, respectively) and achieved high concordance (95. 9 %) in type classification.

40|$|BackgroundStaphylococcus aureus is a {{versatile}} bacterium, {{which can lead}} to various infectious diseases. Various molecular typing methods are applied to the evolution and epidemiology surveys of S. aureus, mostly for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) is still an important pathogen, but their molecular typing is evaluated infrequently. MethodsPulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), <b>spa</b> <b>typing,</b> and detection of five virulent genes for 95 MRSA and 56 MSSA isolates (July–December 2008 and July 2008 –December 2009, respectively) during an overlapping period were performed. ResultsMore diversity was found in MSSA isolates (23 pulsotypes and 25 spa types, excluding 4 new-type and 1 nontypable isolates for <b>spa</b> <b>typing)</b> than in MRSA isolates (19 pulsotypes and 16 spa types, excluding 1 new-type and 1 nontypable isolates for <b>spa</b> <b>typing).</b> By <b>spa</b> <b>typing,</b> t 002 (n =  30), t 037 (n =  23), t 437 (n =  21), t 234 (n =  3), t 1081 (n =  3), and t 1094 (n =  3) were the six major MRSA clones. For MSSA isolates, t 189 (n =  13), t 437 (n =  4), t 084 (n =  3), t 213 (n =  3), t 701 (n =  3), and t 7200 (n =  3) were the six major types. Combining PFGE and <b>spa</b> <b>typing,</b> there were five combinations (pulsotype + spa type) that contained both MRSA and MSSA isolates (pulsotype 9 -t 437, pulsotype 15 -t 037, pulsotype 19 -t 002, pulsotype 21 -t 002, and pulsotype 28 -t 1081).

40|$|Abstract Background For typing of Staphylococcus aureus, DNA {{sequencing}} of the repeat {{region of the}} protein A (spa) gene is a well established discriminatory method for outbreak investigations. Recently, {{it was hypothesized that}} this region also reflects long-term epidemiology. However, no automated and objective algorithm existed to cluster different repeat regions. In this study, the Based Upon Repeat Pattern (BURP) implementation that is a heuristic variant of the newly described EDSI algorithm was investigated to infer the clonal relatedness of different <b>spa</b> <b>types.</b> For calibration of BURP parameters, 400 representative S. aureus strains with different <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> were characterized by MLST and clustered using eBURST as "gold standard" for their phylogeny. Typing concordance analysis between eBURST and BURP clustering (spa-CC) were performed using all possible BURP parameters to determine their optimal combination. BURP was subsequently evaluated with a strain collection reflecting the breadth of diversity of S. aureus (JCM 2002; 40 : 4544). Results In total, the 400 strains exhibited 122 different MLST types. eBURST grouped them into 23 clonal complexes (CC; 354 isolates) and 33 singletons (46 isolates). BURP clustering of <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> using all possible parameter combinations and subsequent comparison with eBURST CCs resulted in concordances ranging from 8. 2 to 96. 2 %. However, 96. 2 % concordance was reached only if <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> shorter than 8 repeats were excluded, which resulted in 37 % excluded <b>spa</b> <b>types.</b> Therefore, the optimal combination of the BURP parameters was "exclude <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> shorter than 5 repeats" and "cluster <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> into spa-CC if cost distances are less than 4 " exhibiting 95. 3 % concordance to eBURST. This algorithm identified 24 spa-CCs, 40 singletons, and excluded only 7. 8 % <b>spa</b> <b>types.</b> Analyzing the natural population with these parameters, the comparison of whole-genome micro-array groupings (at the level of 0. 31 Pearson correlation index) and spa-CCs gave a concordance of 87. 1 %; BURP spa-CCs vs. manually grouped <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> resulted in 95. 7 % concordance.

40|$|Sequence-based {{methods for}} typing Staphylococcus aureus, such as multilocus {{sequence}} typing (MLST) and <b>spa</b> <b>typing,</b> have increased interlaboratory reproducibility, portability, and speed in obtaining results, but {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}} (PFGE), remains the method of choice in many laboratories due to the extensive experience with this methodology and the large body of data accumulated using the technique. Comparisons between typing methods have been overwhelmingly based on a qualitative assessment of the overall agreement of results and the relative discriminatory indexes. In this study, we quantitatively assess the congruence of the major typing methods for S. aureus, using a diverse collection of 198 S. aureus strains previously characterized by PFGE, <b>spa</b> <b>typing,</b> MLST, and, {{in the case of}} methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), SCCmec typing in order to establish the quantitative congruence between the typing methods. The results of most typing methods agree in that MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) differ in terms of diversity of genetic backgrounds, with MSSA being more diverse. Our results show that <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> has a very good predictive power over the clonal relationships defined by eBURST, while PFGE is less accurate for that purpose but nevertheless provides better typeability and discriminatory power. The combination of PFGE and <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> provided even better results.

40|$|A {{putative}} staphylococcal protein A (spa) gene {{was discovered}} in the genome of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and used for developing a species-specific <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> protocol.

40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} {{occurrence of}} livestock-associated (LA) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{associated with the}} clonal complex (CC) 398 within the past years shows the importance of standardized and comparable typing methods {{for the purposes of}} molecular surveillance and outbreak detection. Multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) has recently been described as an alternative and highly discriminative tool for S. aureus. However, until now the applicability of MLVA for the typing of LA-MRSA isolates from different geographic origin has not been investigated in detail. We therefore compared MLVA and S. aureus protein A (<b>spa)</b> <b>typing</b> for characterizing porcine MRSA from distinct Dutch and German farms. Methodology/Principal Findings: Overall, 134 MRSA isolates originating from 21 different pig-farms in the Netherlands and 36 farms in Germany comprising 21 different spa types were subjected to MLVA-typing. Amplification and subsequent automated fragment sizing of the tandem repeat loci on a capillary sequencer differentiated these 134 isolates into 20 distinct MLVA types. Whereas overall MLVA and <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> showed the same discriminatory power to type LA-MRSA (p = 0. 102), MLVA was more discriminatory than <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> for isolates associated with the prevalent spa types t 011 and t 034 (Simpson’s Index of Diversity 0. 564 vs. 0. 429, respectively; p, 0. 001).

Dust samples from four farms were also analysed for the presence of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). On 5 / 9 farms MRSA was isolated and on 2 / 4 farms MSSA was isolated. On two farms, including the empty farm, no MRSA or MSSA could be detected. All MRSA isolates (n = 43) belonged to <b>spa</b> <b>type</b> t 899.

40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{is a major}} {{nosocomial}} pathogen in India, and up to 70 % methicillin resistance {{has been}} reported from hospitals {{in various parts of}} India. Hospitals use phenotyping for the most part, and molecular genotyping is not done. Here we report on the genotyping of 82 single-patient isolates from two hospitals in Bangalore, South India, for the first time. Most of the strains possessed type III or IIIA staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) cassettes, and we did not detect strains with type I, IA, or II cassettes.

40|$|Molecular {{techniques}} such as <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> and multilocus sequence typing use DNA sequence data for differentiating Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Although <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> is capable of detecting both genetic micro- and macrovariation, it has less discriminatory power than the more labor-intensive pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and costly genomic DNA microarray analyses. This limitation hinders strain interrogation for newly emerging clones and outbreak investigations in hospital or community settings where robust clones are endemic. To overcome this constraint, we developed a typing system using DNA sequence analysis of the serine-aspartate (SD) repeat-encoding region within the gene encoding the keratin- and fibrinogen-binding clumping factor B (clfB typing) and tested whether {{it is capable of}} discriminating within clonal groups. We analyzed 116 S. aureus strains, and the repeat region was present in all isolates, varying in sequence and in length from 420 to 804 bp. In a sample of 36 well-characterized genetically diverse isolates, clfB typing subdivided identical spa and PFGE clusters which had been discriminated by whole-genome DNA microarray mapping. The combination of <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> and clfB typing resulted in a discriminatory power (99. 5 %) substantially higher than that of <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> alone and closely approached that of the whole-genome microarray (100. 0 %). clfB typing also successfully resolved genetic differences among isolates differentiated by PFGE that had been collected over short periods of time from single hospitals and that belonged to the most prevalent S. aureus clone in the United States. clfB typing demonstrated in vivo, in vitro, and interpatient transmission stability yet revealed that this locus may be recombinogenic in a primarily clonal population structure. Taken together, these data show that the SD repeat-encoding region of clfB is a highly stable marker of microvariation, that in conjunction with <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> it may serve as a DNA sequence-based alternative to PFGE for investigating genetically similar strains, and that it is useful for analyzing collections of isolates in both long-term population-based and local epidemiologic studies...|$|E

The colonisation pressure per 1000 patient-days was 40. 9 for t 0181, 22. 2 for t 037 and 26. 3 for the less common <b>spa</b> <b>types.</b> The incidence densities of nosocomial MRSA transmission per 1000 colonisation-days were significantly higher for t 1081 (28. 5 vs 4. 0, P< 0. 01) and t 037 (21. 5 vs 4. 0, P= 0. 03) compared with the less common <b>spa</b> <b>types.</b> Proactive screening of MRSA in patients from elderly care homes and targeted isolation of these patients, especially those carrying <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> with high transmissibility, are important for the control of MRSA in hospitals. © 2011 The Healthcare Infection Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{aimed to}} examine the {{dynamics}} of Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in healthy adults. METHOD: Selected S. aureus strains isolated from weekly nasal swabs obtained from 122 healthy young adults over a 13 week period were <b>spa</b> <b>typed.</b> RESULTS: The median duration of intermittent carriage was 4 weeks (IQR 2 - 6) and the median interval between episodes of carriage of different <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> was 3. 5 weeks (IQR 2. 25 - 4). 6 / 19 (32 %) Persistent carriers were colonised {{with more than one}} <b>spa</b> <b>type</b> during the study, and in two persistent carriers a brief period of mixed colonisation with two <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> was observed. Even when the carriage strain changed, it was very rare for persistent carriers to have a period during which they were culture-negative (only 6 / 188 (3 %) swabs submitted by persistent carriers failed to culture S. aureus). CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that at least every eight weeks a healthy young adult is exposed to S. aureus sufficient to cause a new episode of carriage among intermittent carriers. Persistent carriers are almost always colonised with S. aureus and {{over the course of a}} year there will be at least one replacement of the dominant strain...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the distribution and}} frequencies of strain types by protein A-encoding gene (<b>spa)</b> <b>typing</b> among a total of 200 meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) single-patient isolates collected between 2000 and 2005 at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. Nine frequent spa types accounted for 49. 5 % of MRSA isolates, whereas spa type t 041 (15 % of all isolates) belonged to a local epidemic strain that is also a common strain type in southern Germany. Successful control of the outbreak strain was documented by epidemiological data and confirmed by <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> results. The spa type t 044 (3. 5 %), corresponding to a widely disseminated European community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA), was first observed in 2002. The well-known CA-MRSA USA 300 clone was detected in four patients (2 %). Sporadic strains occurring less than four times (32 different spa types) accounted for 23 % of isolates. No predominant spa type was seen, indicating a great genetic diversity. Only 34. 5 % of patient isolates were acquired nosocomially. The presence {{of one or more}} of ten common virulence genes was shown in 79 % of strains. It was demonstrated that the sequence-based <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> method allows analysis of local MRSA epidemiology in relation to other regions and countries over time...|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} {{the value of}} <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> in combination with BURP (based upon repeat pattern) grouping analysis as a frontline tool in the epidemiological typing of Staphylococcus aureus, based on a random collection of 1, 459 clinical isolates sent to the German Reference Centre for Staphylococci within a 6 -month period. The application {{was found to be}} helpful for the classification of isolates into the particular clonal lineages currently prevalent in Germany. Due to its major advantages because of the ease of interpretation and the exchangeability of the results, the use of <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> greatly simplifies communication between laboratories on both the national and the international levels. Thus, it is an excellent tool for national and international surveillance of S. aureus as well as for analysis of the short-term local epidemiology. However, to overcome the limitations of the BURP grouping method in terms of typing accuracy and discriminatory power, the results of the default BURP grouping method must be interpreted with caution. Additional markers, like staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec, lineage-specific genes, or alternative DNA polymorphisms, are indispensable. They should be selected by dependence on the clonal lineage indicated by <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> and subsequent BURP analysis {{as well as on the}} basis of the particular question to be addressed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe spa gene {{occurs in}} all strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), can {{function}} as a genetic marker and might be used distinguish strains at the species level. Hence, due to these advantages, we used <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> and the Based Upon Repeat Pattern (BURP) to assign the clonal and phylogenetic relationships of S. aureus strains. The sensitivity of S. aureus strains to methicillin was determined using agar disk diffusion. The extracted DNA from 56 isolates of S. aureus was subjected to PCR to detect the spa gene with specific primers. The <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> method was performed {{for each of the}} isolates, and then, BURP was used to cluster spa types (spa-CCs). Finally, using relevant software, the phylogenic tree was drawn. The results of this study showed that 25 out of 56 (44. 6 %) isolates were resistant to methicillin. The typing of S. aureus isolates revealed 24 different spa types among 56 isolates, and BURP analysis clustered the 24 spa types into 5 spa clonal complexes (CCs) and 12 singletons. The process of <b>spa</b> <b>typing,</b> in combination with BURP analysis, provides an efficient method for investigating phylogenetic and clonal relationships among clinical isolates and can be useful for monitoring bacterial spread between hospitals and communities as well as between and within hospitals...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) strains isolated from human infections in Mongolia. Infection {{samples were collected}} at two time periods (2007 – 08 and 2011) by the National Center for Communicable Diseases (NCCD) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. S. aureus isolates were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for mecA, PVL, and sasX genes and tested for agr functionality. All isolates were also <b>spa</b> <b>typed.</b> A subset of isolates selected by frequency of <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and multilocus sequence typing. Among 251 S. aureus isolates, genotyping demonstrated methicillin resistance in 8. 8 % of isolates (22 / 251). Approximately 28 % of the tested S. aureus isolates were observed to be multidrug resistant (MDR). Sequence <b>type</b> (ST) 154 (<b>spa</b> t 667) was observed to be a strain with high virulence potential, as all isolates for this <b>spa</b> <b>type</b> were positive for PVL, had a functional agr system and 78 % were MDR. S. aureus isolates of ST 239 (spa t 037) were observed to cause infections and roughly 60 % had functional agr system with a greater proportion being MDR. Additionally, new multilocus sequence <b>types</b> and new <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> were identified, warranting continued surveillance for S. aureus in this region...|$|R

40|$|The genetic {{determinants}} and phenotypic traits {{which make}} a Staphylococcus aureus strain a successful colonizer are largely unknown. The genetic diversity and population structure of 133 S. aureus isolates from healthy, generally risk-free adult carriers were investigated using four different typing methods: multilocus sequence typing (MLST), amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis (AFLP), double-locus sequence typing (DLST), and <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> were compared. Carriage isolates displayed great genetic diversity which {{could only be}} revealed fully by DLST. Results of AFLP and MLST were highly concordant in the delineation of genotypic clusters of closely related isolates, roughly equivalent to clonal complexes. <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> and DLST provided considerably less phylogenetic information. The resolution of <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> {{was similar to that}} of AFLP and inferior to that of DLST. AFLP proved to be the most universal method, combining a phylogeny-building capacity similar to that of MLST with a much higher resolution. However, it had a lower reproducibility than sequencing-based MLST, DLST, and <b>spa</b> <b>typing.</b> We found two cases of methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonization, both of which were most likely associated with employment at a health service. Of 21 genotypic clusters detected, 2 were most prevalent: cluster 45 and cluster 30 each colonized 24 % of the carrier population. The number of bacteria found in nasal samples varied significantly among the clusters, but the most prevalent clusters were not particularly numerous in the nasal samples. We did not find much evidence that genotypic clusters were associated with different carrier characteristics, such as age, sex, medical conditions, or antibiotic use. This may provide empirical support for the idea that genetic clusters in bacteria are maintained in the absence of adaptation to different niches. Alternatively, carrier characteristics other than those evaluated here or factors other than human hosts may exert selective pressure maintaining genotypic clusters...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{has long}} been {{recognized}} as {{a leading cause of}} nosocomial infection. However, several recent publications have demonstrated this pathogen as the cause of community-acquired severe wound infections and necrotizing pneumonia in otherwise healthy individuals. These highly virulent endemic clones have been reported in several locations in the United States and Canada. The rapid spread of the organism, the ability of certain clones to cause serious infection, and the antibiotic resistance of the endemic clones, illustrates the importance of infection control measures. In this study we examined three S. aureus typing techniques; pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and Staphylococcal protein A (spa) sequencing for subspeciation of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA). It is hypothesized that PFGE will result in a higher level of discrimination among the strains, while MLST and <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> will result in highly portable data that lacks the discriminatory power of PFGE. Thirty CA-MRSA isolates that were obtained from Florida and Washington State were characterized by molecular typing methods. Whole genome restriction analysis was performed by PFGE using the SmaI enzyme. Sequence-based typing analyses, MLST and <b>spa</b> <b>typing,</b> were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequencing. PFGE data was analyzed using the BioNumericsÂ® software package and sequence-based data was analyzed using DNAstarÂ®. MLST Alleles were assigned using the online MLST database (www. mlst. net) and spa types were assigned using the Ridom SpaServer (www. ridom. de/spaserver). Molecular characterization of the 30 isolates resulted in 21 pulsotypes, four MLST sequence types (STs), and six spa types. Combining data from both MLST and <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> resulted in only seven strain categories, many of which grouped isolates that are not epidemiologically linked. These data demonstrate that techniques such as MLST and <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> are not well suited for tracking isolates with limited evolutionary diversity such as the CA-MRSA epidemic clones...|$|E
40|$|Background The role {{of general}} {{practitioners}} (GPs) as reservoir and potential source for Staphylococcus aureus (SA) transmission is unknown. Our primary {{objective was to}} evaluate the prevalence of SA and community-acquired methicillin resistant SA (CA-MRSA) carrier status (including <b>spa</b> <b>typing)</b> among GPs and their patients in Belgium. The secondary objective was to deter-mine the association between SA/CA-MRSA carriage in patients and their characteristics, SA carriage in GPs, GP and practice characteristics. Methods The Belgian GPs, who swabbed their patients in the APRES study (which assessed the prevalence of SA nasal carriage in nine European countries; November 2010 –June 2011), were asked to swab themselves as well (May-June 2011). GPs and their patients had to complete a questionnaire on factors related to SA carriage and transmission. SA isolation including CA-MRSA and <b>spa</b> <b>typing</b> {{was performed on the}} swabs.

40|$|The {{physiological}} {{properties of}} 47 Staphylococcus aureus strains were investigated. The test strains were grown on bacteriological media and {{identified by the}} ID 32 STAF system for biochemical identification of bacteria. Sensitivity to antimicrobial agents was performed by the disc diffusion method. The nuc gene and the virulence factors coa, hla, hlb, hld, hlg, hlg- 2, tst, eta, etb, lukF-PV and lukS-PV and mecA gene were detected by the polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the <b>spa</b> <b>type</b> of the studied isolates was also set. According to the obtained results, all strains had the nuc, coa, hla and hld gene. Ten strains (21. 3 %) had also the tst gene, while 37 strains (78. 7 %) had the hlg gene and 35 strains (74. 5 %) had the hlb and hlg- 2 genes. All of the investigated S. aureus isolates were penicillin resistant (100 %), with 29 strains which were also resistant to oxacillin (61. 7 %). Methicillin (oxacillin) resistance was detected by the mecA gene detection, {{which is also the}} first MRSA result from the secretion samples of cows’ mammary glands in Croatia. The researched MRSA strains proved to belong to different <b>spa</b> <b>types,</b> and the most common were <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> t 005, t 011 and t 521, and a new <b>spa</b> <b>type</b> t 9498 was detected...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is a {{commensal}} {{that can}} also cause invasive infection. Reports suggest that nasal cocolonization occurs rarely, but the resources required to sequence multiple colonies have precluded its large-scale investigation. A staged protocol was developed to maximize detection of mixed-spa-type colonization while minimizing laboratory resources using 3, 197 S. aureus-positive samples from a longitudinal study of healthy individuals in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. Initial typing of pooled material from each sample identified a single unambiguous strain in 89. 6 % of samples. Twelve single-colony isolates were typed from samples producing ambiguous initial results. All samples could be resolved into one or more <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> using the protocol. Cocolonization point prevalence was 3. 4 to 5. 8 % over 24 months of follow-up in 360 recruitment-positives. However, 18 % were cocolonized at least once, most only transiently. Cocolonizing <b>spa</b> <b>types</b> were completely unrelated in 56 % of samples. Of 272 recruitment-positives returning ≥ 12 swabs, 166 (61 %) carried S. aureus continuously but only 106 (39 %) carried the same single <b>spa</b> <b>type</b> without any cocolonization; 31 (11 %) switched <b>spa</b> <b>type</b> and 29 (11 %) had transient cocarriage. S. aureus colonization is dynamic even in long-term carriers. New unrelated cocolonizing strains could increase invasive disease risk, and ongoing within-host evolution could increase invasive potential, possibilities that future studies should explore...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} during an 8 -month period, from August 2006 to April 2007, to describe the epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus-associated infections. In addition, the molecular characteristics, antimicrobial susceptibilities and antibiotic resistance determinants were identified in S. aureus isolates from hospitals and the community in Vladivostok, Russia. Among the 63 S. aureus isolates eligible for this study, methicillin resistance was observed in 48 % (n = 30). Hospital-acquired strains accounted for 93 % (28 / 30) of all methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. The major MRSA clone (sequence type (ST) 239, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type III, Panton [...] Valentine leukocidin (PVL) -negative, with two related staphylococcal protein A gene (<b>spa)</b> <b>types</b> (types 3 and 351)) represented 90 % {{of all of the}} MRSA isolates. This clone was multidrug-resistant, and 41 % of isolates showed resistance to rifampicin. Community-acquired MRSA isolates (n = 2) were categorized as ST 30, SCCmecIV, <b>spa</b> <b>type</b> 19, and PVL [...] positive, and as ST 8, SCCmecIV, of a novel <b>spa</b> <b>type</b> 826, and PVL-negative. Eight different STs were detected among methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates, of which 55 % were PVL [...] positive. One MSSA clone, which was categorized as ST 121, <b>spa</b> <b>type</b> 273, and PVL [...] positive, caused fatal community-acquired pneumonia infections.
