5|$|The {{development}} of equestrian technology proceeded {{at a similar}} pace as the {{development of}} horse breeding and utilisation. The changes in warfare during the Early Middle Ages to heavy cavalry both precipitated and relied on {{the arrival of the}} stirrup, solid-treed <b>saddle,</b> <b>and</b> horseshoe from other cultures.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a <b>saddle,</b> <b>and</b> occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, horses are usually put under <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> {{trained to be}} ridden {{between the ages of}} two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses {{specifically}} bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60calendar months (five years) old.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ending}} cutscene, Keil and the dragon enter the tower. While {{traveling}} {{down a long}} corridor, the dragon surrounds Keil in a force field, lifting him from the <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> suspending him in the hallway. Keil watches as the dragon continues on {{to the core of}} the tower, then a blinding light is seen and the tower explodes. Keil wakes up some time later in a desert area abutting the ocean. Looking down, he sees the foot prints of the blue dragon around him, indicating that after the explosion, the dragon carried him to safety and flew away.|$|E
5|$|The Mérens {{has long}} {{been used as a}} {{delivery}} and courier horse, as well as being used by local farmers. It has also been used by the winemakers of Languedoc, gardeners and dock workers, as well as continuing to be used by French armies, who appreciated its endurance. The breed was used in the mines, both under <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> in harness. It was used by smugglers moving goods through the mountains between France and Spain, mainly carrying wood and minerals, and was known for its endurance and sense of direction.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} building in Lookout Point {{is the local}} fire station, which also serves both Caversham and Green Island. This 1956 structure is located immediately {{to the north of}} the <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> is a prominent landmark upon entering or leaving Dunedin. Not far from the fire station to the north-east is Dunedin's tallest tree, a eucalyptus measuring an estimated 100 metres. The Dunedin Southern Motorway officially begins at the Lookout Point saddle, between Calton Hill and Maryhill, and sweeps down over broken hill country past Green Island to Mosgiel and the Taieri Plains.|$|E

5000|$|One hadith, {{considered}} valid by Muhammad al-Bukhari, says: Narrated Abu Huraira:The Prophet said, [...] "The reciting of the Zabur (i.e. Psalms) {{was made}} easy for David.

5|$|A young peasant named Diermot is {{employed}} as a beater for the king's hunting party. One night the king receives a note from a messenger, requesting his services to help quell a rebellion in the remote village of Turnvale. As the king's party departs, Diermot’s pony follows them, unwittingly carrying him to the battle. When the party arrives at Turnvale they are not confronted by a peasant revolt. Instead they find a band of man-eating Skorl, led by an enchantress named Selena, the titular temptress. The king's men are defeated and the king is killed. In the process, Diermot is thrown from his <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> is knocked unconscious. The Skorl take Diermot prisoner and imprison him in the local dungeon.|$|E
5|$|About 10 a.m., one of Desha's neighbors {{encountered}} the riderless gray mare, still rigged with <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> bridle. Catching the horse, he rode {{it up the}} road, shortly finding Desha's riderless bay (which he recognized), with a saddle but no bridle. He noticed blood on the neck and withers of Desha's horse. Further along, the neighbor encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control, but mounted the gray mare and returned home. Later that day, friends at Desha's tannery noticed that he was unusually quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong. He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{innovations}} that revolutionised {{the effectiveness of}} mounted warriors in battle were the <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> the stirrup. Riders quickly learned to pad their horse's backs {{to protect themselves from}} the horse's spine and withers, and fought on horseback for centuries with little more than a blanket or pad on the horse's back and a rudimentary bridle. To help distribute the rider's weight and protect the horse's back, some cultures created stuffed padding that resembles the panels of today's English saddle. Both the Scythians and Assyrians used pads with added felt attached with a surcingle or girth around the horse's barrel for increased security and comfort. Xenophon mentioned the use of a padded cloth on cavalry mounts as early as the 4th century BC.|$|E
