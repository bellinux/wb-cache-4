5000|$|As {{a member}} of the second chamber in 1849 Ziegler voted in support of [...] "taxation rejection". Context for the vote {{involved}} a liberal majority in the Second Chamber refusing to vote for a <b>supplementary</b> income <b>tax</b> which the king wished to levy in order to fund increased military spending {{in the wake of the}} 1848 revolutions, the democratising impact of which he was keen to restrict. Despite being rejected by the vote in the assembly, the <b>supplementary</b> <b>tax</b> was levied anyway, and the subservience of the new parliament was thereby asserted. Further demonstration of government supremacy came when Franz Ziegler was charged with High treason and Sedition. Even though a majority in the assembly had voted down the <b>supplementary</b> <b>tax,</b> Ziegler was the only assembly member to face indictment, apparently because he had been the one who had proposed the motion rejecting the tax. He was convicted, deprived of his public offices, and sentenced to a prison term which he served in Magdeburg. The terms of his sentence also included exclusion from his home region, the voting district of Brandenburg for a further year following his release, and accordingly he now moved to Berlin where through hard work he was able to restore his fortunes. He also became a writer, publishing poems as well as books on social and political themes. It was only in 1855 that he was able to return to his family in Brandenburg.|$|R

40|$|With the 2008 {{reform of}} {{business}} taxation (Unternehmensteuerreform 2008) a preferential treatment of retained earnings for non-incorporated companies was introduced: Earnings may be retained at a preferential tax rate (29. 8 %) {{and will be}} subjected to <b>supplementary</b> <b>tax</b> (26. 4 %) when they will be withdrawn in the future. By now, studies on this topic {{have been based on}} case studies. Our article is based on microdata of the German Income Tax Statistics 2002 and provides a general empirical analysis of the new regulation's fiscal effects. Unlike studies before, we do not only consider marginal tax rates but also take into account that retained earnings may reduce progressive income tax for other earnings. Moreover we consider that taxpayers may retain earnings without having to pay <b>supplementary</b> <b>taxes</b> on these earnings if they are withdrawn within two years. On the individual level, beneficiaries of the preferential treatment are mainly taxpayers with high income. For instance, those with an annual income of at least 750, 000 Euro reduce their tax burden by approximately 10 % (unmarried, withdrawal before retention of 100, 000 Euro). By contrast, taxpayers with an annual income of less than 22, 087 Euro do not benefit from the reform at all. On the macroeconomic level, the fiscal effects of the reform are considerable: Depending on the scenario, we estimate a shortfall in receipts of 3. 4 bn, 5. 0 bn Euro and 7. 5 bn Euro (theoretical upper limit) ...|$|R

40|$|We have {{proposed}} a metamaterial lens that enables sub-wavelength focusing, which is shorter than an operating wavelength. Our lens is a two dimensional array of a unit cell consisting of a metallic dual-plate printed on a dielectric substrate. The unique dual-plate structure provides negativeness both in permittivity and permeability, with no help from conventional additional structures, which are normally printed on the opposite of metallic patterns. Therefore, we can focus a source (or an image) in a tiny distance shorter than the free space wavelength (λ) at the frequencies of interest. Furthermore, since the proposed geometry does not need <b>separate</b> <b>supplementary</b> structures to acquire negative permittivity or permeability, our lens is much simpler than conventional metamaterial lenses, which is a strong point in practical applications. We have validated sub-wavelength focusing ability in a 6 GHz frequency band through an experiment of near field scanning, which provided the width of about 0. 19 λ at a half maximum of a peak value of an measured image. The width of the focused image through the lens is more than 4 times shorter than that without the lens, which confirms the validity of our design approach...|$|R
5000|$|The French {{appear to}} have kept most intact the medieval {{tradition}} of the consul—a representative {{of the nation of}} merchants. When the state assumed control of the consuls in the later sixteenth century they diminished the privileges of the nation of merchants. The primary function became financial. However, the state then lost control again over the consuls and the position became a personal one that could be succeeded by an heir. The French consuls did not have fixed incomes like the Venetians, which caused them to [...] "farm" [...] the position out to someone able to pay a higher price for it. This meant that the nation of merchants was potentially represented by someone who was unqualified. The consul had no legal right to collect <b>supplementary</b> <b>taxes.</b> However a voluntary agreement could be reached, but if one member of the French nation refused to pay or lodged a complaint against the consul it would sabotage the agreement. The French had success in the Ottoman Empire notably through their political and diplomatic initiatives rather than their commercial ones. The consuls were responsible for promoting French trade in the Levant through persuasion (gifts, donations, favours etc..) The French consuls were not allowed to participate in trade and commerce themselves, but they were to report political and economic information back to the French government. However, the consulate was frequently headed by corrupt consuls and many of them did engage in commerce.|$|R

Here {{we report on the}} discovery of a hidden (H) topologically protected electronic state in a layered dichalcogenide 1 T-TaS 2 crystal reached {{as a result of a}} quench caused by a single 35 fs laser pulse. The properties of the H state are markedly different from any other state of the system: it exhibits a large drop of electrical resistance, strongly modified single particle and collective mode spectra and a marked change of optical reflectivity. Particularly important and unusual, the H state is stable for an arbitrarily long time until a laser pulse, electrical current or thermal erase procedure is applied, causing it to revert to the thermodynamic ground state. Major observed events can be reproduced by a kinetic model describing the conversion of photo excited electrons and holes into an electronically ordered crystal, thus converting a Mott insulator to a conducting H state. Its long-time stability follows from the topological protection of the number of periods in the electronic crystal.

40|$|We {{illustrate}} {{a proposal to}} reform the personal income tax and the family allowance in Italy which aims at attaining a fair tax treatment of the family, laying emphasis on the redistributive processes in favour of large and poor households. Our proposal {{is based on a}} simplification of the tax rate schedule (with a reduction of income brackets) and a new design of the tax credits for dependents which implies the fiscal exemption of a sort of basic income, which is decreasing as the income of the household increases. The new scheme of <b>supplementary</b> <b>tax</b> credits for dependents, related to family income thresholds, would match the need to keep into account the economic conditions of the household with the need to avoid the abandonment of the definition of ability to pay on individual basis. The proposal also aims at attaining a closer integration between the personal income taxation and the family allowance, with a sizable revaluation of the amount of family allowances and its extension to self-employee. The distributional analysis, using the tax-benefit model DIRIMOD, shows a slight revenue loss and a significant increase, with respect to the 1995 system, in both the progressivity and the redistributive impact of the income tax. The distributional effects are even stronger if we keep into consideration the reformed system of family allowances.

A general theme in the surveys covering the first half of 2011 are the rising cost pressures, rising raw material and energy costs and, especially in retail and tourism the impact of inflation and consumer uncertainty on sales trends.

The Scottish Chambers’ Business Survey (Q 1 2011) noted that once again for manufacturing firms raw material/suppliers prices (86 %) and transport costs (65 %) were the most widely reported cost pressures and for firms these pressures are now more evident than in previous quarters. More than three quarters of manufacturing, 93 % of wholesale and 76 % of retail respondents reported pressures to raise prices due to rising raw material/suppliers’ prices.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to {{research}} the regulatory framework of the Greek tax audit procedure and its application by the tax authorities under a constitutional aspect, in order to propose a constitutional “model” of the tax audit. For this purpose, the constitutional and institutional framework of the tax procedure {{as well as the}} tax audit procedure was examined. Then, the constitutional rules and principles that should apply for the formation of the regulatory framework and during the execution of the tax audit were examined. The thesis shows that the current tax audit procedure introduces several constitutional issues. More specifically, the regulatory framework of the tax audit does not agree with the principles of good legislation. Furthermore, the tax administration knows almost no strategic planning nor is it stuffed with capable civil servants, which are constantly educated and valuated. In addition, the ambiguous regulatory framework of preventive, temporary and <b>supplementary</b> <b>tax</b> audit may cause contradictions and phenomena of arbitrariness against the tax payers. The same applies for some of the methods for the simplification of the tax audit procedure, {{such as the use of}} computed values and the automated closure of the tax cases. Questions are also raised in connection with the constitutionality of measures, such as the prolonging of the time of the statute of limitation of the right of the State to issue tax assessments acts. Moreover, the classification of the majority of the tax sanctions as administrative sanctions, though some of the have the characteristics of penal sanctions, has as a result that the taxpayers are not entitled to fundamental defend rights. Furthermore, the right of tax secrecy is violated by the numerous exemptions of the said secrecy. Anti-constitutional limitations are also introduced as far as the right of hearing and the access right are concerned. Finally, the one-dimensional superiority recognised in favour of the public revenue interest indirectly causes many of the constitutional problems of the tax audit procedure. ...|$|R

First, a municipalitys membership in a Public Intermunicipal Cooperation Body (Établissement Public de Coopération Intercommunale: EPCI) tends to increase the rates of the four local direct taxes relative to a municipality that does not belong to such a group. Second, the rates are structurally higher in EPCIs that have adopted a single business <b>tax</b> and a <b>supplementary</b> local <b>tax</b> on households (fiscalité mixte). Third local taxation rates tend to rise structurally with municipality size, then decline in the largest cities.

A literature review was conducted to provide background for the study and guide development of a survey instrument. The survey was disseminated to hospital payment systems experts in 15 jurisdictions. Fifty-one surveys were disseminated, with 34 returned. The surveys returned covered 14 of the 15 jurisdictions invited to participate. The majority (71 %) of countries update the patient classification system and/or payment tariffs {{on an annual basis}} to try to account for new technologies. Use of short-term <b>separate</b> or <b>supplementary</b> payments for new technologies occurs in 79 % of countries to ensure adequate funding and facilitate adoption. A minority (43 %) of countries use evidence of therapeutic benefit and/or costs to determine or update payment tariffs, although it is somewhat more common in establishing short-term payments. The main barrier to using evidence is uncertain or unavailable clinical evidence. Almost three-fourths of respondents believed diagnosis-related group systems incentivize or deter technology adoption, depending on the particular circumstances. Improvements are needed, such as enhanced strategies for evidence generation and linking evidence of value to payments, national and international collaboration and training to improve existing practice, and flexible timelines for short-term payments.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Eurobarometer (EB) survey series is a unique programme of cross-national and cross-temporal comparative social science research. Since the early seventies representative national samples in all European Union (EU) (formerly the European Community (EC)) member states have been simultaneously interviewed {{in the spring and}} autumn of each year. Starting with EB 34. 1 (autumn 1990), <b>separate</b> <b>supplementary</b> surveys on special issues have been conducted under almost every EB number. The EB is designed to provide regular monitoring of public social and political attitudes in the EU through specific trend questions. More information about the series may be found on the Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Data Archive for the Social Sciences (GESIS) Eurobarometer Survey Series web pages. GESIS was formed in 2007 when three independent institutes merged (Social Science Information Centre (IZ) in Bonn, Central Archive for Empirical Social Research in Cologne (ZA), and Centre for Survey Research and Methodology (ZUMA) in Mannheim). Users should note that earlier EBs are available from GESIS. Background Work on European survey series began in early 1970, when the Commission of the European Community sponsored simultaneous surveys of the EC. These surveys were designed to measure public awareness of, and attitudes toward, the Common Market and other EC institutions, in complementary fashion. They also probed the goals given top priority for each respondent's nation. These concerns have remained a central part of the EC's research efforts - which were carried forward in the summer of 1971 with another six-nation survey that gave special attention to agricultural problems. The nine EC member countries were then surveyed again on the same topic areas in September 1973. After 1973, the surveys took on a somewhat broader scope in content as well as in geographical coverage, with measures of subjective satisfaction and the perceived quality of life becoming standard features of the EC public opinion surveys. Over time, the member states of the EC/EU have increased in number, and the coverage of the EB surveys has widened accordingly. In 1974, nine countries were surveyed: France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg. Greece has been included since the autumn 1980 survey (EB 14) onwards, Portugal and Spain since autumn 1985 (EB 24), the former German Democratic Republic since autumn 1990 (EB 34), Finland since the spring of 1993 (EB 39), and Sweden and Austria since the autumn of 1994 (EB 42). Norway has been included in some surveys since 1991, from EB 36 onwards. In 2004, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia joined the EU, and in 2007, Bulgaria and Romania (some of these countries participated in the Candidate Countries Eurobarometer survey series (see under GN 33343) before full accession). Candidate countries of Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Iceland have also been included in selected surveys. Some surveys are also conducted in Turkey, and in the Turkish Cypriot Community (Northern Cyprus). The Eurobarometer public opinion surveys are conducted on behalf of and co-ordinated by the European Commission, DG Press and Communication - Opinion Polls Sector (European Commission Public Opinion Analysis).

Since then, the so-called “Riester pension” has grown in popularity. Apart from subsidized pension plans, unsubsidized private pension insurances as an instrument for old-age have been enormously important for a long time. With data for the years 2005 to 2009 from the German SAVE study, we analyze whether the decision for a “Riester pension” is independent of the decision for unsubsidized private pension insurance using methods for simultaneous equations. Our estimation results indicate that decisions on “Riester” and private pensions are not independent and the proposed random-parameters bivariate probit model results in efficiency gains compared to single probit estimations. Regarding governmental subsidies, we find positive incentive effects of child subsidies whereas low income earners are not induced to increase their old-age provisions. Further, there is strong evidence for a “crowding-in” among alternative assets {{as well as a}} significant effect of demand inducement. Finally, considering the saving motives, individuals do not take a “Riester pension” because of securing pension payments only but to pick up granted subsidies. ...|$|R
40|$|In this research, several {{improvements}} to the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) were analysed. The EU ETS is a market for emission allowances and the European Union's main instrument for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (of which CO 2 is the main component). However, the CO 2 allowance price in this market has been highly volatile and generally too low to stimulate significant long-term reductions in CO 2 emissions. National and system-wide price floors and ceilings were investigated, prompted by the UK’s implementation of a CO 2 price floor through a <b>supplementary</b> CO 2 <b>tax.</b> The effects of the "backloading" of CO 2 allowances and the proposed Market Stability Reserve were also investigated. While the latter measures may increase dynamic efficiency, this research showed that a well-designed price corridor is even more efficient, while still achieving the long-term abatement targets and stabilising prices. Furthermore, different methods for adjusting the CO 2 emissions cap in response to changes in renewable energy policies were investigated. Finally, the impact of investors' risk aversion on {{the functioning of the}} CO 2 market was evaluated. The analyses were conducted with the use of EMLab-Generation, an agent-based model that simulates two interconnected electricity markets with a joint CO 2 emissions trading system. In this model, the companies have limited knowledge about the future, which makes it possible to investigate the impact of public policy instruments on long-term investment dynamics.
