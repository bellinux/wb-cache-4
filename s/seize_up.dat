2500|$|Faithfull began {{living in}} New York {{after the release}} of the {{follow-up}} to Broken English, Dangerous Acquaintances, in 1981. Despite her comeback, she was still battling with addiction in the mid-1980s, at one point breaking her jaw tripping on a flight of stairs while under the influence. In another incident her heart stopped. A disastrous appearance on Saturday Night Live was blamed on too many rehearsals, but it was suspected that drugs had caused her vocal cords to <b>seize</b> <b>up.</b> Rich Kid Blues (1984) was another collection of her early work combined with new recordings, a double record showcasing both the pop and rock 'n' roll facets of her output to date. In 1985, Faithfull performed [...] "Ballad of the Soldier's Wife" [...] on Hal Willner's tribute album [...] Faithfull's restrained readings lent themselves to the material, and this collaboration informed several subsequent works.|$|E

5000|$|Skalor (Gulf in Japan) is disgusting even by Seacon standards, always leaking oil, {{lubricants}} {{and various}} other fluids is so disgusting that even the other Seacons try to avoid him. Constantly seeping lubricant and other fluids, Skalor doesnt seem that bothered about getting it fixed - even when it causes him to <b>seize</b> <b>up</b> in battle. His motto - [...] "I stink, therefore I am" [...] - is an obvious reference to René Descartess famous philosophical statement. He transforms into a Coelacanth.|$|E
50|$|Koenig blasts off at dawn to {{lead the}} day's search. His control systems {{suddenly}} <b>seize</b> <b>up</b> and the Eagle crash-lands just beyond the base perimeter. Technical's analysis shows that an unknown element in the atmosphere, in combination with airborne particles of moondust, is causing all exposed metals to corrode—except for those coated with a graphite compound. Koenig orders the base re-sealed and re-pressurised with its own atmosphere immediately, then an Eagle stripped down and graphite applied to every metal surface. As an afterthought, he has the Ariel satellite dumped outside.|$|E

5000|$|Up-tempo {{downstroke}} picking {{requires a}} strong wrist {{to keep all}} the muscle movements as tension-free as possible. For long or extended passages, endurance becomes the focus, as fast downpicking can quickly cause a burn in the wrist, sometimes extending up into the arm and causing the muscles to <b>seize</b> <b>up.</b> If the guitarist has a difficult time keeping the strokes smooth, {{the quality of the}} music can suffer, often sounding sloppy and/or strained. While downpicking in general is sometimes considered a good beginner's technique for learning at slow tempos, it requires a great deal of skill to perfect and utilize downpicking in much faster applications where alternate picking is quite often used as a [...] "short-cut".|$|E

Stark, having detected interfering frequencies in his armor's systems throughout the battle, deduces that Stane isn't experienced enough to pilot the armor without some help via an external computer.

50|$|Bellamy {{then comes}} after Shaeffer in Drunkard's Walk and {{attempts}} to force Shaeffer into landing by repeatedly slamming the car with sonic booms.

Bellamy rushes back aboard to try to deal with this, but the gyros overload and <b>seize</b> <b>up</b> while he is still on the boarding ladder, causing the yacht to spin end-for-end and bounce off into the distance.
