40|$|This project {{presents}} a methodological approach, suggestions and information in uprating the existing 275 kV transmission overhead line. The work also calculate and analyses the effect <b>of</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>swing</b> angle on L 3 tower top geometrics {{and keep the}} probability of flashover at low state. In this project, the insulator length and clearances <b>of</b> <b>swing</b> <b>conductor</b> to tower body, top cross-arm, bottom cross-arm and conductor to conductor are considered. The purpose of this work {{is to determine the}} clearances necessary to insulator withstand for 400 kV line. In addition, {{it is also important to}} make sure that conductors have to maintain the clearances under TOV (temporary over-voltage), switching and lightning overvoltages. The work in this project have used Excel and Smart Draw to analyze the results and plot the clearance distances <b>of</b> <b>swing</b> <b>conductor,</b> also the phase to phase rms voltage and redrawing the existing overhead tower. Therefore, voltages rating for the L 3 tower can be determined through the available clearances. Firstly, the voltage rating is determined with standard 400 kV specification of insulator length. Then, the insulator is being shorted to do the analysis to the voltage rating and lastly, the overall cross-arm is changed to fully insulate such as composite cross-arm. As the result, by using standard insulator length, the tower only carried 351 kV rather than composite cross-arm that carry 450 kV. The standard L 3 tower will be increase the power transfer capacity to 400 kV in term of voltage by changing the steel cross-arm to composite cross-arm...|$|R

25|$|Just as the {{resistance}} <b>of</b> a <b>conductor</b> depends upon temperature, {{the resistance}} <b>of</b> a <b>conductor</b> depends upon strain. By placing a conductor under tension (a form of stress {{that leads to}} strain {{in the form of}} stretching <b>of</b> the <b>conductor),</b> the length <b>of</b> the section <b>of</b> <b>conductor</b> under tension increases and its cross-sectional area decreases. Both these effects contribute to increasing the resistance of the strained section <b>of</b> <b>conductor.</b> Under compression (strain in the opposite direction), the resistance of the strained section <b>of</b> <b>conductor</b> decreases. See the discussion on strain gauges for details about devices constructed {{to take advantage of this}} effect.|$|R
