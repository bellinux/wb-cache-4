25|$|As a teenager, Eliyahu {{teamed up}} with Shabtai Yudelevitz to conduct Jewish outreach. In 1950–1951, Mordechai was among the leaders of Brit HaKanaim (Hebrew: בְּרִית הַקַנַאִים, lit. Covenant of the Zealots), a radical {{religious}} Jewish underground organization which operated against the widespread trend of secularization in the country. They torched cars of people who drove on Shabbat, and butcher shops where non-kosher meat was sold. They once plotted to toss a <b>smoke</b> <b>bomb</b> into the Knesset during a debate on drafting Orthodox women into the IDF. A {{member of the group}} was in the audience during the debate with the <b>smoke</b> <b>bomb</b> in his pocket, but lacked the opportunity to activate it.|$|E

Four students (three boys and one girl aged between 12 and 16 years) and the school janitor all suffered gunshot wounds, which were aimed towards the chest, stomach, arm, knee, and hand. A pregnant female teacher also suffered facial injuries when she {{was hit by a}} thrown <b>smoke</b> <b>bomb.</b> In addition, 16 police officers had to be treated for respiratory problems due to smoke inhalation, while 15 students suffered from shock.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, a <b>smoke</b> <b>bomb</b> {{was planted}} in the Manhattan office of music {{impresario}} Sol Hurok, who organized Soviet performers' U.S. tours. Iris Kones, a Jewish secretary from Long Island, died of smoke inhalation, and Hurok and 12 others were injured and hospitalized. Jerome Zeller of the JDL was indicted for the bombing and Kahane later admitted his part in the attack. JDL activities were condemned by Moscow refuseniks who felt that the group's actions were making it less likely that the Soviet Union would relax restrictions on Jewish emigration.|$|E

25|$|On 20 November 2006, at {{approximately}} 9:20 a.m. local time, Bosse {{drove to the}} Geschwister Scholl-Schule and strode into the schoolyard with his weapons, wearing a long black trench coat and a black gas mask. On the way, he started firing randomly and wounded the school janitor, who was seriously injured by {{a shot in the}} stomach. A female teacher who was following the janitor was also injured when Bosse threw a <b>smoke</b> <b>bomb,</b> which hit her in the face. Around ten minutes after the shooting started, police were informed of the incident.|$|E
25|$|In Jeff Rovin's 1995 non-canon novelization, {{set before}} the first game, Scorpion plays a minor role and his backstory {{deviates}} from the games, as he {{is something of a}} combination of a father and son instead of an individual ninja specter. The father, a former Lin Kuei member turned tolltaker named Yong Park, was killed by Sub-Zero in front of Park's family and his body dumped into a canal. Yong's spirit merges with his young son Tsui's body in order for the latter to seek revenge under the form of Scorpion, during which his costume and armor magically appear on his body. When Scorpion challenges Sub-Zero to battle in hopes of avenging his father's murder, they do nothing more than exchange words before Sub-Zero sets off a <b>smoke</b> <b>bomb</b> and escapes. Scorpion never uses his spear aside from a scene in which he shoots it at a tree as a test shortly after his transformation.|$|E
500|$|On January 20, 2012, in {{what the}} Associated Press {{described}} as their [...] "breakthrough performance", eight {{members of the group}} performed a song on the Lobnoye Mesto in Red Square, entitled [...] "Putin Zassal". The title was variously translated by English language media as [...] "Putin has Pissed Himself", [...] "Putin Chickened Out", [...] "Putin Got Scared" [...] and [...] "Putin is Wetting Himself". The song called for a popular revolt against the Russian government and an occupation of Red Square. According to a Pussy Riot member identified as [...] "Shayba", the song was inspired by the events of December 24, 2011, during which approximately 100,000 people attended anti-Putin rallies in central Moscow. She told the Financial Times: [...] "We saw how troops were moving around Moscow, there were helicopters in the sky, the military was put on alert. The regime just wet its pants on that day. And the symbol of the regime is Putin." [...] During the performance a member ignited a <b>smoke</b> <b>bomb,</b> which led to Pussy Riot members being arrested and briefly detained on administrative charges, a Russian legal term similar to a summary offence or misdemeanor. A judge found two members of the group, Galkina and Schebleva, [...] "guilty under article 20.2 of the Administrative Code (violation of the rules for conducting rallies and pickets) and imposed a fine of 500 rubles on each." ...|$|E

500|$|Ibuki reappears as a playable {{character}} in Street Fighter V {{as one of}} the DLC characters released after the game's launch. She was supposed to arrive in May 2016 but was delayed to July. In her prologue story, Ibuki finally finishes her ninja assignment and is informed by her friend Sakura about the party invitation sent from her rival Karin Kanzuki. Arriving at the Kanzuki Estate, Ibuki fights and defeat Birdie and Karin. After the fight, Karin lets her stay at the party with handsome boys and gives her the contract which has been approved by the Shinobi village to work with her. Ibuki also appears in the end of R. Mika's prologue story, rejecting her offer in muscle training which angers R. Mika who beats her in a fight. Ibuki and R. Mika continue to argue through the course of the game's main story, [...] "A Shadow Falls", which begins when they and Karin travel to the New York City to find out who is behind the activation of the seven Black Moons, eventually finding out it is a Shadaloo plot. During the first infiltration of the Shadaloo base, Ibuki fights Balrog but fails to beat him. She then uses her <b>smoke</b> <b>bomb</b> to distract the enemies and the two successfully escape with it until they reunited with Karin. They witness Zangief beat Abel, Ibuki watching in disgust while R. Mika idolizes him. In the final assault against Shadaloo, Ibuki and R. Mika fight off Shadaloo soldiers. Ibuki is last seen watching Shadaloo's destruction with the other fighters.|$|E

2500|$|Following a <b>smoke</b> <b>bomb</b> {{incident}} on Montreal Metro subway, student activists from the Université du Québec à Montréal threatened {{to prevent the}} race from going ahead as part of ongoing demonstrations across Quebec.

Around 2 AM Friday morning President Boyd requested arrest of the students on the Pentacrest by highway patrolmen, but the next day he regretted the mass arrests and said he had received faulty information.

2500|$|Her {{appearance}} on the political scene was almost immediately marked by controversy. [...] In 1965, Princess Beatrix became engaged to the German aristocrat Claus von Amsberg, a diplomat working for the German Foreign Office. Their marriage caused a massive protest during the wedding day in Amsterdam on 10 March 1966. Prince Claus {{had served in the}} Hitler Youth and the Wehrmacht and was, therefore, associated by a part of the Dutch population with German Nazism. Protests included such memorable slogans as [...] "Claus 'raus!" [...] (Claus out!) and [...] "Mijn fiets terug" [...] ("Return my bicycle" [...] – a reference to occupying German soldiers confiscating Dutch bicycles during WWII). A <b>smoke</b> <b>bomb</b> was thrown at the Golden Coach by a group of Provos causing a violent street battle with the police. As time went on, Prince Claus {{became one of the most}} popular members of the Dutch monarchy and his 2002 death was widely mourned.|$|E
2500|$|A brief peak in republicanism {{was caused}} by the {{announced}} engagement of Crown Princess Beatrix to the German nobleman Klaus von Amsberg on 10 June 1965. Although he had been member of the Hitler Youth and briefly served in the Wehrmacht, an official investigation concluded he had not committed any war crimes. The States-General granted him Dutch citizenship as Claus van Amsberg and approved of the affiance. Nevertheless, the general public still resented the German occupation and oppression during the war, and {{a significant portion of the}} population opposed the marriage. On the occasion of the marriage, 109 years after Eillert Meeter had published his anti-monarchist book in English, it was translated to Dutch as Holland, kranten, kerkers en koningen. Jewish organisations were offended that Amsterdam, where many Jews had been deported by the Nazis during the war, had been chosen as the wedding location, and the couple proposed Baarn instead, but the government insisted on the capital. The wedding day on 10 March 1966 saw violent protests, most notably by the anarchist-artist group Provo. They included such memorable slogans as [...] "Claus, 'raus!" [...] (Claus, get out!). The wedding carriage's ride to and from the church in Amsterdam, where the Provo movement had been stirring up trouble for quite some time, was disrupted by riots with smoke bombs and fireworks; one <b>smoke</b> <b>bomb</b> was thrown at the wedding carriage by a group of Provos. According to several newspapers, there were about a thousand rioters. Many of them chanted [...] "Revolution!" [...] and [...] "Claus, 'raus!". Crowd control barriers and flagpoles were overthrown, bikes and mopeds thrown on the streets, and in the Kalverstraat a car was pushed over. For a time, it was thought that Beatrix would be the last monarch of the Netherlands. However, over time, Claus became accepted by the public.|$|E

2500|$|Lt. Leroy C. Jones and {{his partner}} arrived at the scene at about 8:40 PM, driving south on E. 124th Street. They parked and Jones ran around the corner onto Auburndale Avenue. Heavy gunfire rang out, and Jones fell dead {{in the middle of}} the block at 8:45 PM, lying on the {{sidewalk}} on the north side of the street. Patrolmen Angelo Santa Maria and Steve Sopko approached the scene from Auburndale Avenue about the time Jones died, but the number of abandoned police vehicles force them to park two blocks away. [...] Santa Maria ran behind the houses on the south side of Auburndale Avenue and spotted Jones lying on the sidewalk. Shouting to police hiding behind various types of cover on the north side of the street, he learned that it was Lt. Jones. Santa Maria asked for a volunteer among the many African American bystanders to drive a car along Auburndale, providing him with cover so he could retrieve Jones. [...] Twenty-two year old clerk James E. Chapman agreed to help. According to a federal government report, Chapman's car could not get close enough to Jones due the large number of abandoned police and civilian vehicles on Auburndale. Both men got out of the car and tried to retrieve Jones. Santa Maria found cover next to a police sergeant who had a submachine gun. Throwing a <b>smoke</b> <b>bomb</b> to provide cover, Santa Maria ran to get Jones while the sergeant opened fire with his submachine gun. Santa Maria was shot in the back at 9:00 PM. Patrolman Steve Marencky later retrieved him and put him in an abandoned police car for safety. Chapman was shot in the head about the same time that Santa Maria was shot, and died instantly.|$|E
