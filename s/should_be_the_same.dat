Greek troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, {{in the northern part of}} the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region.

25|$|The burden {{voltage can be}} {{significant}} in very low-voltage circuit areas.

25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center drill bits, it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist drill bit) is a spotting drill bit (or a spot drill bit, as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting drill bit <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as, or greater than, the conventional drill bit so that the drill bit will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|E
25|$|As the air {{pressure}} decreases at altitudes {{above sea level}} (and increases below sea level) the uncorrected reading of the barometer will depend on its location. The reading is then adjusted to an equivalent sea-level pressure for purposes of reporting. For example, if a barometer located at sea level and under fair weather conditions is moved to an altitude of 1,000 feet (305m), about 1 inch of mercury (~35 hPa) must be added on to the reading. The barometer readings at the two locations <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> if there are negligible changes in time, horizontal distance, and temperature. If this were not done, {{there would be a}} false indication of an approaching storm at the higher elevation.|$|E

25|$|In Western Han Dynasty, {{elaborate}} and lavish burials were common practice. One reason was {{the notion of}} imperishability of the soul: {{it was believed that}} another world existed for the dead, and they needed food and accommodation just like the living. Therefore, the consecration for the dead <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as what was provided for the living, and all the necessities in life should be brought into the grave for use in the afterlife. The other was the emphasis on filial piety during that time. In Han Dynasty, filial piety had become an important approach to become an official, and {{elaborate and}} lavish burials are a significant way to show filial piety to one's deceased parents. These were among the main reasons why there were so many precious artifacts in Xin Zhui's tomb.|$|E
25|$|Having unique {{features}} of tunable resonances and unprecedented near-field enhancement, plasmon is an enabling technique for light management. Recently, performances of thin-film solar cells have been pronouncedly improved by introducing metallic nanostructures. The improvements are mainly {{attributed to the}} plasmonic-optical effects for manipulating light propagation, absorption, and scattering. The plasmonic-optical effects could: (1) boost optical absorption of active materials; (2) spatially redistribute light absorption at the active layer due to the localized near-field enhancement around metallic nanostructures. Except for the plasmonic-optical effects, the effects of plasmonically modified recombination, transport and collection of photocarriers (electrons and holes), hereafter named plasmonic-electrical effects, have been proposed by Sha, etal. For boosting device performance, they conceived a general design rule, tailored to arbitrary electron to hole mobility ratio, to decide the transport paths of photocarriers. The design rule suggests that electron to hole transport length ratio should be balanced with electron to hole mobility ratio. In other words, the transport time of electrons and holes (from initial generation sites to corresponding electrodes) <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> The general design rule can be realized by spatially redistributing light absorption at the active layer of devices (with the plasmonic-electrical effect). They also demonstrated the breaking of space charge limit in plasmonic-electrical organic solar cell.|$|E
25|$|The smoke {{detector}} has two ionization chambers, one {{open to the}} air, and a reference chamber which does not allow the entry of particles. The radioactive source emits alpha particles into both chambers, which ionizes some air molecules. There is a potential difference (voltage) between pairs of electrodes in the chambers; the electrical charge on the ions allows an electric current to flow. The currents in both chambers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as they are equally affected by air pressure, temperature, and the ageing of the source. If any smoke particles enter the open chamber, some of the ions will attach to the particles and not be available to carry the current in that chamber. An electronic circuit detects that a current difference has developed between the open and sealed chambers, and sounds the alarm. The circuitry also monitors the battery used to supply or back up power, and sounds an intermittent warning when it nears exhaustion. A user-operated test button simulates an imbalance between the ionization chambers, and sounds the alarm {{if and only if}} power supply, electronics, and alarm device are functional. The current draw of an ionization {{smoke detector}} is low enough for a small battery used as sole or backup power supply to be able to provide power for months or years without the need for external wiring.|$|E
