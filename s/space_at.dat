5|$|After the Sounds vacated Greer, Mayor Dean {{expressed}} interest in converting the facility to a community sporting complex or a new city park, but, {{nearing the end of}} his term, ultimately deferred the decision to the next mayor (Megan Barry, elected 2015). In the meantime, Metropolitan Director of Parks Tommy Lynch recommended that the stadium be demolished due to the potential costs for any renovation, including the removal of asbestos.

5|$|Although Emily Huskisson {{had wanted}} to keep the service {{small-scale}} and free from pageantry, William Huskisson had been an instrumental figure in the development of Liverpool and there was a huge amount of sympathy and respect for him. Almost all the city's inhabitants who were in a position to attend the funeral lined the route; it was estimated that 69,000 people, roughly half the city's population, attended. Reports spoke of all available <b>space</b> <b>at</b> every window being packed with onlookers, other than the house in Duke Street in which Huskisson had stayed for the 10 days before the journey, and of people climbing trees and crowding onto roofs for a better view, despite rain and hail.|$|E
5|$|Astronomically, {{the most}} {{important}} property of compact objects is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation. Accretion, the falling of dust or gaseous matter onto stellar or supermassive black holes, {{is thought to be}} responsible for some spectacularly luminous astronomical objects, notably diverse kinds of active galactic nuclei on galactic scales and stellar-size objects such as microquasars. In particular, accretion can lead to relativistic jets, focused beams of highly energetic particles that are being flung into <b>space</b> <b>at</b> almost light speed.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of <b>space</b> <b>at</b> the University of Chicago, Spedding {{proposed}} to organize part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa State College, where he had colleagues who were willing to help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The intention was that staff at Ames would eventually move to Chicago when space became available, but this never happened. The success of the Ames Project ensured that it became a separate laboratory within the Manhattan Project.|$|E

5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent <b>space</b> <b>at</b> a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E
40|$|Article purchased; Published online: 20 Nov 2017 Field {{studies were}} {{conducted}} during the 2014 and 2015 wet seasons at Zaria in the northern Guinea savanna and at Iburu in the southern Guinea savanna of Nigeria to determine the productivity of maize– soybean intercropping system. There were four treatment combinations in the experiment: sole maize; sole soybean; maize <b>spaced</b> <b>at</b> 50 cm and intercropped with soybean; and maize <b>spaced</b> <b>at</b> 65 cm and intercropped with soybean. The experiment was {{laid out in a}} randomized complete block design with three replications. The results showed that sole cropped maize and soybean generally outperformed the intercropped component crops. Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) was greater than 1 for all the intercrop treatments, indicating that it is advantageous to grow maize and soybean in association than in pure stands. Except for 2014 in Zaria, LER for intercropped maize <b>spaced</b> <b>at</b> 50 cm was higher than that for maize <b>spaced</b> <b>at</b> 65 cm. Gross Monetary Value (GMV) was generally higher for intercrops than sole crops except in Iburu in 2015 where GMV for intercropped maize <b>spaced</b> <b>at</b> 65 cm was similar to those of sole maize and soybean. Monetary Advantage Index (MAI) was positive for all intercrop treatments in both locations and years, which shows definite yield and economic advantages compared to the sole cropping systems. This suggests that farmers can intercrop soybean and maize with maize <b>spaced</b> <b>at</b> 50 cm and 65 cm. Peer Revie...|$|R

5|$|For much of {{its early}} life, the school {{consisted}} only of Nathan Smith and a small class of students, operating in borrowed <b>space</b> <b>at</b> Dartmouth College. Students of Smith were educated as apprentices, and received a Bachelor of Medicine degree upon graduation. Like Dartmouth College as a whole, the medical school had continual funding shortages. As time passed, however, the popularity of both the medical instruction and the basic sciences taught at the school drew undergraduates and training physicians alike. Soliciting funds {{from the state of}} New Hampshire, Smith was able to obtain medical equipment and, by 1811, a dedicated physical plant for the school.|$|E
5|$|Generally, yellow {{stingrays}} pay little heed to divers and can {{be approached}} closely. If stepped on or otherwise provoked, however, this ray will defend itself with its tail spine, coated in potent venom. The resulting wound is extremely painful, but seldom life-threatening. Small and docile, the yellow stingray adapts readily to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it requires {{a large amount of}} <b>space</b> (<b>at</b> least 180gal or 684L) and a fine, deep substrate with minimal ornamentation.|$|E

Lillehammer {{was awarded the}} 1994 Olympics in 1988, but a year later the plans to use Balbergbanen were abandoned. The venue was regarded as unsuitable; for instance NOK30 million {{would have to be}} spent on building a new access road. In addition, a new water and sewer system, new stands, participant facilities and a normal hill would have to be built. The available <b>space</b> <b>at</b> Balbergbakken was limited, and the organizers saw it as advantageous to have the ski stadium close to the ski jumping hills.|$|E
