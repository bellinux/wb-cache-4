50|$|In the 17th century, the {{bottlenose}} skate was prized by the French for food. Because of {{its large}} size and slow reproductive rate, the bottlenose skate is extremely vulnerable to exploitation by fisheries. Anecdotal data {{suggests that there}} has been a substantial decline in the abundance and geographical range of this species in the north Atlantic and Mediterranean. In the north Atlantic, populations of bottlenose skates have declined severely or disappeared from the Bay of Biscay and the Irish Sea; there are no longer targeted fisheries in these regions due to localized population collapses in the 1960s. There are also no recent records of this species in the waters off the United Kingdom, where it historically occurred. The bottlenose ray still persists along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, though the population data is uncertain due to confusion with the shagreen ray (Leucoraja fullonica) and the <b>sandy</b> <b>ray</b> (L. circularis).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results on nine {{of the most important}} elasmobranch fish species of the nine years (2001 - 2009) of the Porcupine bank Spanish surveys. The main species in biomass terms in Porcupine bank bottom trawl survey, in decreasing biomass abundance order, are: blackmouth catshark, birdbeak dogfish, velvet belly, Knifetooth dogfish, lesser spotted dogfish, bluntnose sixgill shark, <b>sandy</b> <b>ray,</b> cuckoo ray and common skate. Many of these species occupy mainly the deep areas covered in the survey, especially birdbeak dogfish, knifetooth dogfish and velvet belly. Less confined to deeper grounds are blackmouth catshark and <b>sandy</b> <b>ray,</b> while lesser spotted dogfish and cuckoo ray inhabit mainly the shallower grounds close to the Irish shelf or the central mound in the bank. Length distributions of these species along the survey series are also presented and discussed. The few available data on siki sharks from the Porcupine bank survey are also summarized.

40|$|This working {{document}} {{presents the results}} on nine {{of the most important}} elasmobranch species of the Porcupine bank Spanish surveys during the last decade (2001 - 2011).

40|$|This working {{document}} {{presents the results}} on the most significant elasmobranch species of the Porcupine Bank Spanish surveys in 2014 and updates the documents presented in previous years with {{the information in the}} whole historical series from 2001. The main species in biomass terms in this survey were Galeus melastomus (blackmouth catshark), Deania calcea (birdbeak dogfish), Scymnodon ringens (Knifetooth dogfish), Dipturus nidarosiensis (Norwegian skate), Scyliorhinus canicula (lesser spotted dogfish), Etmopterus spinax (velvet belly lantern shark), Hexanchus griseus (bluntnose sixgill shark), Dalatias licha (Kitefin shark), Leucoraja circularis (<b>sandy</b> <b>ray),</b> Dipturus cf. flossada, Leucoraja naevus (cuckoo ray) and Dipturus cf. intermedia (common skate). Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed for these species. All the species analysed increased its biomass in 2014, except S. canicula and D. cf. flossada that decreased. D. calcea individuals smaller than 65 cm were captured again in 2014 after not having been captured the previous year, although catches were very low.

40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown that the cardiac outflow tract of sharks and chimaeras does not consist of a single {{myocardial}} component, the conus arteriosus, as classically accepted, but two, namely, the myocardial conus arteriosus and the non-myocardial bulbus arteriosus. However, the anatomical composition of the outflow tract of the batoid hearts remains unknown. The present study was designed to fill this gap. The material examined consisted of hearts of two species of rays, namely, the Mediterranean starry ray (Raja asterias) and <b>sandy</b> <b>ray</b> (Leucoraja circularis). They were studied using scanning electron microscopy, and histochemical and inmunohistochemical techniques. In both species, the outflow tract consists of two components, proximal and distal with regard to the ventricle. The proximal component is the conus arteriosus; it is characterized by the presence of compact myocardium in its wall and several transverse rows of pocket-shaped valves at its luminal side. Each valve consists of a leaflet and its supporting sinus. Histologically, the leaflet has two fibrosas, inner and outer, and a middle coat, the spongiosa. The distal component lacks myocardium. Its wall consists of smooth muscle cells, elastic fibers and collagen. Thus, it shows an arterial-like structure. However, it differs from the aorta because it is covered by the epicardium and crossed by coronary arteries. These findings indicate that the distal component is morphologically equivalent to the bulbus arteriosus of sharks and chimaeras. In contrast to foregoing descriptions, the valves of the first transverse row are distally anchored to the bulbus arteriosus and not to the ventral aorta. Our findings give added support to the notion that presence of a bulbus arteriosus at the arterial pole of the heart is common to all chondrichtyans, and not an apomorphy of actinopterygians as classically thought.
