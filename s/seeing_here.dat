500|$|In 2012, Jostein Johnsen of 1UP.com {{credited}} {{the game}} with redefining the turn-based battle system, attempting to turn it [...] "into an interactive animated film." [...] According to Johnsen, what [...] "we are really <b>seeing</b> <b>here</b> is a proto-attempt at a live and interactive animated sequence. A sequence where the player decides what happened, and what attacks were used to slay the cardboard cutouts on the left." [...] He credited the game for [...] "saving the JRPG" [...] and [...] "truly renewing it for more advanced technology." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed to moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Unusual Suspects" [...] an A-, and {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "is a love letter to {{the very idea of}} paranoia". Furthermore, VanDerWerff argued that [...] "as the episode moved its way to its climax, when Mr. X improbably lets the Gunmen live after seeing as much as they did [...] it struck me that what we’re <b>seeing</b> <b>here</b> may not entirely be meant to be taken seriously, just as 'Memoirs Of A Cigarette Smoking Man' [...] is more about who the CSM wished he might have been than the person he actually was. This isn’t a true story; it’s a manifesto." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 6/10, and, while calling the entry [...] "an interesting diversion from the normal format of the series", he noted that [...] "there are still some issues with the plausibility of the story, and ultimately, the questions surrounding Mulder overshadow the character development of the Gunmen themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Bartley and ÓBriain {{had been}} promised [...] "exclusive access" [...] to Chávez by the government's Minister of Communications. They arrived in Venezuela in September 2001. While filming the pilot they met the president, after which they reconsidered their approach. Bartley explained, [...] "We had... this notion of {{investigating}} Chávez—was he a demagogue? Was the media persona just that? What makes him tick? My sense had changed as we got closer; what we're <b>seeing</b> <b>here</b> {{is a guy who}} is motivated, driven, not the demagogue with another side, drinking, carousing. I began to see him as more transparent—what {{you see is what you}} get." [...] Bartley and ÓBriain began by attempting to build a relationship with Chávez that would allow them the access they required. At first, the president's staff treated the filmmakers with suspicion and made filming difficult. After numerous delays, Bartley and ÓBriain finally got through to Chávez. They calculated that they needed to [...] "press the right buttons" [...] to gain his support, so they presented [...] him with an old edition of the memoirs of the general Daniel Florence O'Leary, irish who had fought alongside Simón Bolívar. Inside, they had written a quote from the Irish socialist playwright Seán O'Casey. Slowly, Bartley and ÓBriain gained their subjects' trust, [...] "dissolving any self-consciousness as a result of their cameras".|$|E

6000|$|... "How {{perfectly}} I {{remember my}} resolving {{to look for}} you upstairs, and setting off to find {{my way to the}} East room, without having an idea whereabouts it was! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came along, and my looking in and <b>seeing</b> you <b>here</b> sitting at this table at work; and then your cousin's astonishment, when he opened the door, at <b>seeing</b> me <b>here!</b> To be sure, your uncle's returning that very evening! There never was anything quite like it." ...|$|R

60|$|Then I {{began to}} charge the weapon, and while so doing glanced involuntarily across the deck, <b>seeing</b> <b>here</b> and there a tiny thread of dull red. On the instant my heart turned cold, for until then I had had no thought that any of our lads were hurt.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Gerard, [...] "I shall to-morrow to the north, where I am wanted. But before I go I propose, as {{suggested}} yesterday, that we five together with Langley, whom I counted on <b>seeing</b> <b>here</b> to-night, now form ourselves into a committee for arming the people. Three {{of us are}} permanent in London; Wilkins and myself will aid you in the provinces. Nothing can be decided on this head till we see Langley, who will make a communication from Birmingham that cannot be trusted to writing. The seven o'clock train must have long since arrived. He is now a good hour behind his time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But what I {{want to know}} is this: Is it to Senor Perkins that {{we ought}} to be thankful for <b>seeing</b> you <b>here</b> at all?" [...] asked Mrs. Markham impatiently.|$|R

6000|$|... "Fancy <b>seeing</b> you <b>here,</b> George!" [...] said Billie. [...] "We're always meeting, aren't we? How did {{you come}} to {{separate}} yourself from the pigs and chickens? I thought you were never going to leave them." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{what is the}} {{so strong}} {{evidence}} of the actual identity of these places? What is it that makes me so {{sure that this is}} the Mount of Olives, and that water-channel there the brook Cedron, and the hamlet on the other side the veritable Bethany? Why is one to be so sure of these, and yet feel such an infinity of doubt as to that village of Emmaus, that valley of Ajalon, that supposed Arimathea, and the rest of them? Nay, I cannot well say, at any rate not in these light novel pages. Dr. Stanley, with considerable distinctness does say. But go and see: with the ordinary Protestant Christian <b>seeing</b> <b>here</b> will be believing, as seeing over in that church of the holy places most indisputably will be disbelieving.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if the land-breeze holds, my lord;--one breeze oft blows another home.--Stand up, and gaze! From cape to cape, {{this whole}} main we see, is young and froward. And far southward, past this Kanneeda and Vivenza, are haughty, {{overbearing}} streams, which at their mouths dam back the ocean, and long refuse to mix their freshness {{with the foreign}} brine:--so bold, so strong, so bent on hurling off aggression is this brave main, Kolumbo;--last sought, last found, Mardi's estate, so long kept back;--pray Oro, it be not squandered foolishly. Here lie plantations, held in fee by stout hearts and arms; and boundless fields, that may be had for <b>seeing.</b> <b>Here,</b> your foes are forests, struck down with bloodless maces.--Ho! Mardi's Poor, and Mardi's Strong! ye, who starve or beg; seventh-sons who slave for earth's first-born--here is your home; predestinated yours; Come over, Empire-founders! fathers of the wedded tribes to come!--abject now, illustrious evermore:--Ho: Sinew, Brawn, and Thigh!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Dorothea tried now to {{turn her}} {{thoughts}} towards immediate duties, and one of these was of a kind which others were determined to remind her of. Lydgate's ear had caught eagerly her mention of the living, {{and as soon as}} he could, he reopened the subject, <b>seeing</b> <b>here</b> a possibility of making amends for the casting-vote he had once given with an ill-satisfied conscience. [...] "Instead of telling you anything about Mr. Tyke," [...] he said, [...] "I should like to speak of another man--Mr. Farebrother, the Vicar of St. Botolph's. His living is a poor one, and gives him a stinted provision for himself and his family. His mother, aunt, and sister all live with him, and depend upon him. I believe he has never married because of them. I never heard such good preaching as his--such plain, easy eloquence. He would have done to preach at St. Paul's Cross after old Latimer. His talk is just as good about all subjects: original, simple, clear. I think him a remarkable fellow: he ought to have done more than he has done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!... Nicolaes is {{my friend}} ... I counted on <b>seeing</b> him <b>here</b> ... he would help me I know ... but your father, Gilda, would drag me to the gallows with his own hand if he knew that I am here." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I {{promise not}} to tell mother," [...] he said, presently; [...] "and <b>seeing</b> you're <b>here</b> safe and well, I guess I won't go packing a gun down there, {{wherever}} that is. But I won't promise to keep anything from Dick that perhaps he ought to know." ...|$|R
60|$|I went to Marlborough House {{to look at}} the English {{pictures}}, which I {{care more}} about <b>seeing,</b> <b>here</b> in England, than those of foreign artists, because the latter will be found more numerously and better on the Continent. I saw many pictures that pleased me; nothing that impressed me very strongly. Pictorial talent seems to be abundant enough, up to a certain point; pictorial genius, I should judge, is among the rarest of gifts. To be sure, I very likely might not recognize it where it existed; and yet it ought to have the power of making itself known even to the uninstructed mind, as literary genius does. If it exist only for connoisseurs, it is a very suspicious matter. I looked at all Turner's pictures, and at many of his drawings; and must again confess myself wholly unable to understand more than a very few of them. Even those few are tantalizing. At a certain distance you discern {{what appears to be a}} grand and beautiful picture, which you shall admire and enjoy infinitely if you can get within the range of distinct vision. You come nearer, and find only blotches of color and dabs of the brush, meaning nothing when you look closely, and meaning a mystery at the point where the painter intended to station you. Some landscapes there were, indeed, full of imaginative beauty, and of the better truth etherealized out of the prosaic truth of Nature; only it was still impossible actually to see it. There was a mist over it; or it was like a tract of beautiful dreamland, seen dimly through sleep, and glimmering out of sight, if looked upon with wide-open eyes. These were the more satisfactory specimens. There were many others which I could not comprehend in the remotest degree; not even so far as to conjecture whether they purported to represent earth, sea, or sky. In fact, I should not have known them to be pictures at all, but might have supposed that the artist had been trying his brush on the canvas, mixing up all sorts of hues, but principally white paint, and now and then producing an agreeable harmony of color without particularly intending it. Now that I have done my best to understand them without an interpreter, I mean to buy Ruskin's pamphlet at my next visit, and look at them through his eyes. But I do not think that I can be driven out of the idea that a picture ought to have something in common with what the spectator sees in nature.|$|E
50|$|Roughly one {{kilometre}} {{outside the}} village towards Wendelsheim is found the Neumühle (“New Mill”), a former Hunolstein homestead.

50|$|In November 2015, he {{suggested}} on BBC Radio 5 Live that his party leader Jeremy Corbyn should resign over {{the question of}} whether to conduct air strikes on ISIL in Syria: 'What we’re <b>seeing</b> <b>here</b> is an attempted coup by Jeremy Corbyn and the people around him in the bunker trying to take over the party. It’s unacceptable. What we're <b>seeing</b> <b>here</b> is an attempted coup by a group to try and over-ride and over-run others. It is unacceptable. How does Jeremy Corbyn and his tiny band of Trots in the bunker think they've got the unique view on it all? If anyone should resign after this incident, it should be Jeremy Corbyn'.|$|E
6000|$|... "As to {{the action}} of which you spoke so {{strongly}} when I {{had the pleasure of}} <b>seeing</b> you <b>here,</b> I am very glad that you abandoned it, for your own sake and for mine, and the sake of all us generally to whom the peace of the Church is dear.|$|R
6000|$|BALSQUITH (going to the table). Quite right. I forgot them. (To Mitchener.)

6000|$|... "It {{is a great}} honour, prince. We {{had heard}} a rumour that an attempt {{had been made to}} seize you; and that you had disappeared, no one knew whither, and men thought that you were {{directing}} your course towards Germany; but little did we dream of <b>seeing</b> you <b>here,</b> in the west." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{this animal}} reserve you can find, apart from lions and elephants. Among other animals {{there is a}} variety of buffaloes, antelopes, baboons and smaller mammals in the reserve.

50|$|Other {{tourist attractions}} {{around the place}} is the Maa Markama Temple, Laxminarayana Temple at Therubali and the Shiva temple at Paikapada, Rayagada.

50|$|Unilever's {{decision}} {{could represent}} {{a defining moment}} for the palm oil industry. What we're <b>seeing</b> <b>here</b> is the world's largest buyer of palm oil using its financial muscle to sanction suppliers who are destroying rainforests and clearing peat lands. This has set a new standard for others to follow.|$|E

50|$|In 1876 the Conservative {{government}} of José María Medina in Honduras was crumbling, {{especially with the}} scandal of loans {{for the construction of}} Rail transport in Honduras and the disappearance of political and representatives of Honduras abroad.

Guatemalan President, <b>seeing</b> <b>here</b> the opportunity to establish a liberal and related to their interests in Honduras Central Union regime, led to the arrival of Marco Aurelio Soto as president, along with his cousin, Ramón Rosa.|$|E
5000|$|Juns (...) {{is a long}} {{drawn out}} village about 2 km up the valley from Lanersbach. It {{comprises}} several small hotels and private homes. There is a show mill worth <b>seeing</b> <b>here</b> that used to grind the barley corn grown here right up until just a few decades ago. Two toboggan runs descend from the Höhlenstein Hut and the alpine pasture of Grieralm, both roughly 5 km long, ending in Juns. The runs are lit {{and can be used}} in the evening.|$|E
5000|$|If I felt {{somewhat}} {{surprised at}} <b>seeing</b> <b>here,</b> as elsewhere throughout the temple, the renowned Moeris III, adorned {{with all the}} insignia of royalty, giving place to this Amenenthe Hatshepsut, for whose name we may search the royal lists in vain, still more astonished was I to find upon reading the inscriptions that wherever they referred to this bearded king in the usual dress of the Pharaohs, nouns and verbs were in the feminine, as though a queen were in question.
