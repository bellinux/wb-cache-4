60|$|To move three {{thousand}} {{pounds on the}} shoulders a hundred yards was no slight task, {{and to do it}} in half a gale, <b>slushing</b> through the snow in heavy rubber boots, was exhausting. In addition, there was the taking down of the tent and the packing of small camp equipage. Then came the loading.

By two o'clock it had all been accomplished, and Kit, despite his two breakfasts, was weak with the faintness of hunger. His knees were shaking under him.

He glanced about him and sighed. Why could not men be honest and true? It seemed too bad that he must go away and leave all this; but the events of the night were strong upon him, and he knew that in order to be true to himself he must escape.|$|E

50|$|<b>Slush,</b> {{also called}} <b>slush</b> ice, is a slurry mixture of small ice {{crystals}} (e.g., snow) and liquid water. In the natural environment, <b>slush</b> forms when ice or snow melts. This often mixes with dirt and other materials, {{resulting in a}} gray or muddy brown color. Often, solid ice or snow will block the drainage of fluid water from slushy areas, so <b>slush</b> often goes through multiple freeze/thaw cycles before completely disappearing. In areas where road salt is used to clear roadways, <b>slush</b> forms at lower temperatures than it would ordinarily, and only in salted areas; this can produce {{a number of different}} consistencies over the same geographical area.|$|R
40|$|Lake Pääjärvi in {{southern}} Finland freezes over every winter {{and the ice}} cover is static. The structure of the ice in the lake has been mapped in 1993 – 1999. The ice thickness ranged from 31 to 70 cm, and the ice sheet consisted of two layers: columnar or macro grained congelation ice and fine grained snow-ice. The snow-ice portion was 10 – 43 %. The average thicknesses were: 46 cm for total ice, 12 cm for snow-ice and 9 cm for snow. The maximum annual ice thickness showed rather weakly in-creasing level with decreasing mean winter air temperature. The grain size of snow-ice was typically 1 – 5 mm with maximum 8 – 9 mm. The congelation ice showed large macrocrystals, some columnar, with di-mensions from 2 cm to more than 10 cm, columns were 2 – 4 cm in diameter and more than 10 cm in height. Prior to the snow-ice formation the snow layer was compacted in <b>slushing</b> to the fraction of about 2 / 3. The ice meltwater had the following properties: the conductivity (at 25 oC) was 7 – 18 µS/cm, pH was 6. 1 – 7. 3, and the contents of soluble and suspended matter were 8 – 18 mg/l and 1. 0 – 2. 5 mg/l, respectively.

40|$|In {{the current}} study, {{modification}} of NSSC pulp broke fibers {{was done by}} forming starch polymeric multilayers, using Layer-by-Layer (LbL) layering method. After fiber <b>slushing</b> and preparation of pulp suspension with 0. 5 % consistency and conductivity formation of about 437 µS/cm, adding water solution of 1 mM NaCl, the experiments of fibers treatment were conducted to build the polymeric layers (up to 5 consecutive layers). Afterward, water retention value (WRV) of fibers was calculated in samples to evaluate the influence of this method on fibers hydrophilicity. The fibers were then used to prepare standard handsheets (60 ± 3 g/m 2) and the physical and strength properties of sheets were evaluated {{as a function of}} the number of layers deposited on the fibers. The results showed that the WRV index of the fibers was improved by the LbL treatment of NSSC broke pulp fibers, due to the increase in starch electrostatic absorption. Successive variation in paper apparent density increase and paper thickness decrease confirmed the construction of starch multilayers on the surface of broke fibers. Formation of such multilayers on broke fibers has led to considerable improvement in tensile index (from 13. 21 N. m/g to 30. 65 N. m/g) and burst index (from 1. 23 kPa. m 2 /g to 2. 36 kPa. m 2 /g).

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the South African Transport Conference 17 - 20 July 2000 "Action in transport for the new millennium", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: The use of foamed bitumen for the modification and improvement of roadbuilding materials is increasing globally. This is mainly due to the increased commercial availability of static and mobile plants with the capacity to produce foamed bitumen following the lapse in patents on the foam nozzle system. As new rehabilitation procedures for maintenance and upgrading of the South African road network such as “In place cold recycling with foamed bitumen” emerge, so a level suitable level of understanding of these processes and reliability in the products requires development. The primary objective of the research was to further the understanding of foamed bitumen treatment. This {{was carried out by}} characterising the foamed materials with the same tests as the equivalent emulsion treated materials, which is a better-understood product. In addition to the standard tests, triaxial testing was also carried out on the foamed mix only, as part of a research investigation. Acelerated Pavement Testing (APT) was performed as part of the rutting potential investigation during early strength conditions. It also provided insight into ravelling of foamed bitumen and emulsion treated layers under traffic. The influence of <b>slushing</b> with water or diluted emulsion were investigated and reported. The comparisons between foamed bitumen and bitumen emulsion treated mixes have highlighted the differences between these mixes. Foamed bitumen has provided higher tensile strengths than the equivalent emulsion mix, but higher field compaction results and consequently better rut resistance was achieved for the emulsion treated materials, probably due to a more favourable moisture regime during compaction. The influence of the cement content was not investigated. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.
