However, Peru's market <b>shares</b> <b>in</b> <b>imports</b> from countries with which it has trade agreements are low, reflecting a poor level of exploitation of treaties.

The identification of commercial opportunities is the first step that needs to be taken so that Peru can take advantage of its comparative advantages and the current trade agreements by designing commercial strategies that allows our entrepreneurs and producers to be more competitive abroad. </p...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{revocation}} of tariff exemptions on exports of developing countries, using data from the cases of Competitive Needs Limits (CNL) built into the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). CNLs are arguably imposed on super competitive GSP beneficiaries and aim to limit their exporting capacity. We exploit the variation in the timing of the implementation of the CNLs across countries to identify the impact. We find that being excluded from the GSP due to a CNL induces a large and significant drop <b>in</b> <b>imports</b> from excluded countries, both in value and <b>in</b> their <b>share</b> <b>in</b> <b>imports</b> from all sources. Contrary to the policy objectives of CNLs, the excluded countries {{do not appear to be}} super competitive. In addition, we find some evidence of exporters increasing their exports of related products to the US after the CNL exclusion applies. Finally, our findings suggest that much of the benefits of CNLs accrue to non-GSP countries, rather than other GSP beneficiaries.

In the empirical part of the paper, I show that Swedish tariff protection increased substantially in the period even though tariff income as a proportion of total imports decreased slightly. This seeming contradiction is explained by the restructuring of Swedish imports {{that took place in the}} period under review; the <b>share</b> <b>in</b> <b>imports</b> of highly protected consumer goods declined while the share of capital goods with lower protection rates and duty free raw materials and input goods increased.

40|$|This paper studies how a rise <b>in</b> China's <b>share</b> of U. S. imports could lower {{pass-through}} {{of exchange}} rates to U. S. import prices. We develop a theoretical model with variable markups {{showing that the}} presence of exports from a country with a fixed exchange rate could alter the competitive environment in the U. S. market. In particular, this encourages exporters from other countries to lower markups in response to a U. S. depreciation, thereby moderating the pass-through to import prices. Free entry is found to further moderate the pass-through, in that a U. S. depreciation encourages entry of exporters whose costs are shielded by the fixed exchange rate, which further intensifies the competitive pressure on other exporters. The model predicts that certain conditions are necessary to facilitate this 'China explanation' for falling pass-through, including a 'North America bias' in U. S. preferences. The model also produces a log-linear structural equation for pass-through regressions indicating how to include the China share. Panel regressions over 1993 – 1999 support the prediction that a high China <b>share</b> <b>in</b> <b>imports</b> lowers pass-through to U. S. import prices. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} the growing {{significance}} of the Arab import market for the global community this study focuses on how the market shares of leading exporters in the Arab world have evolved {{over the past two}} decades. In first part of the analysis I looked at the trends of these market shares over time and in comparison to other developing regions. I investigated the market shares of the United States, China, Japan and the aggregate market share of four largest European economies (France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom). Since GCC constitutes the largest and most important sub-regional import market inside the Arab world, the study focuses on GCC with more detail. The trend analysis revealed that during 1988 - 2007 the United States, Japan and European countries have lost market <b>share</b> <b>in</b> Arab markets. China’s market share, which was very small {{at the beginning of this}} period, enjoyed a substantial growth over these two decades. The market shares of European countries and the United States were relatively stable before 2000 and most of this market loss was realized during 2000 - 2007. For Japan on the other hand the market loss was most substantial during the first half of 1990 s followed by another noticeable loss during 2005 - 2007. China’s market share grew at a slow pace up until 2000, followed by faster growth during 2001 - 2007. In the second part of this analysis I used statistical regression models to investigate the impact of important geopolitical events on relative market shares of the same exporters that were studied in the first section. In {{light of the}} complex diplomatic and security relations between the United States and Arab countries it might be the case that Arab imports from the US are sensitive to the ups and downs of the US-Arab relations. To investigate this theory I focused on four important geopolitical events: Gulf War I (1991), Second Palestinian Intifada (2000 - 2001), The September 11 terror attack (2001) and the US invasion of Iraq (2003 - 2004). In my statistical model the dependent variables are the market shares of the leading exporters to each Arab country or bloc of countries. The statistical results suggest that the Gulf War I and the US invasion of Iraq have both been associated with changes <b>in</b> US market <b>share</b> <b>in</b> Arab <b>imports.</b> We observe a positive association between Gulf War I and the US market <b>share</b> <b>in</b> GCC countries and the aggregate imports of Arab countries in 1991 and 1992. On the other hand we observe a negative association between the invasion of Iraq and the US market <b>share</b> <b>in</b> aggregate <b>imports</b> of the Arab world. Among GCC countries this negative association is only significant for the US market <b>share</b> <b>in</b> Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the analysis shows a strong and positive growth <b>in</b> market <b>shares</b> of Asia and Europe during 2003 and 2004 which are associated with the US invasion of Iraq. The results for the second intifada/September 11 event are mixed. This period is associated with an increase <b>in</b> US market <b>share</b> <b>in</b> Bahrain and a negative market <b>share</b> <b>in</b> Saudi Arabia and the UAE. No significant association is detected in other GCC countries or <b>in</b> the aggregate <b>imports</b> of GCC as a group. Nevertheless we observe a negative association between this pair of events and the US market <b>share</b> <b>in</b> the aggregate <b>imports</b> of Arab countries. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent of}} pass-through of exchange rate and tariff changes into import prices using sectoral panel data (at the 2 -digit SITC level) for the post-reform period in India (1990 - 2001). After having controlled for unobserved effects that might {{have an impact on}} the import prices by using sector dummies, we find that on average exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) is a dominant effect compared to tariff rate pass-through (TRPT) in explaining changes <b>in</b> India’s <b>import</b> prices. The sectoral panel results suggest that the pass-through of exchange rates and tariff rates varies across products. ERPT into import prices is significant in 12 industries, whereas TRPT is significant only in 6 industries, with full pass-through. However, ERPT is incomplete only in 4 industries, but TRPT is incomplete in 36 industries, which means that firms exporting to India more frequently adopt strategies to maintain their market share against tariffs than against exchange rate changes. The sectoral differences in pass-through seem to be related to the sector’s <b>share</b> <b>in</b> total <b>imports</b> and the sector’s effective protection rate. Hence India’s relatively high levels of protection {{have an impact on the}} behaviour of foreign exporters. ...|$|R

This study finds that the economics of jatropha-based biodiesel depend on several factors, such as diesel price, yield of jatropha seeds per hectare, and availability of markets for production byproducts, such as glycerol and jatropha cake. Under the scenarios considered, jatropha biodiesel is unlikely to be economically competitive in Nepal unless seed yields per hectare are implausibly large and high returns can be obtained from byproduct markets that do not yet exist. In the absence of byproduct markets, even earnings from a carbon credit do not help jatropha biodiesel to compete with diesel unless the credit value exceeds US$ 50 /tCO 2 (which is well above current values) and jatropha seed yield is at or above the midrange of the scenarios considered.
