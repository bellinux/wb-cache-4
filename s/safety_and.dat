40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{hypotheses}} derived from social and experiential learning theories, we meta-analytically investigated how <b>safety</b> training <b>and</b> workplace hazards impact the development of <b>safety</b> knowledge <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> performance. The results were consistent with an expected interaction between the level of engagement of <b>safety</b> training <b>and</b> hazardous event/exposure severity in the promotion of <b>safety</b> knowledge <b>and</b> performance. For <b>safety</b> knowledge <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> performance, highly engaging training was considerably more effective than less engaging training when hazardous event/exposure severity was high, whereas highly and less engaging training had comparable levels of effectiveness when hazardous event/exposure severity was low. Implications of these findings for theory testing and incorporating information on objective risk into workplace <b>safety</b> research <b>and</b> practice are discussed...|$|R

To get in-depth knowledge of its role, this study measured managers' and employees' perceptions of the communication's role on six <b>safety</b> management <b>and</b> performance criteria for road safety practices by conducting a survey using a questionnaire among 165 employees and 135 managers. Path analysis using AMOS- 19 software shows that some of the safety management road safety practices have high correlation with the safety performance, namely, from the six antecedents, only the <b>safety</b> training <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> promotion, closely correlate with the <b>safety</b> motivation, <b>and</b> only <b>safety</b> commitment, <b>safety</b> communication <b>and</b> feedback have close relations with the <b>safety</b> knowledge <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> behavior compliance, <b>and</b> only <b>safety</b> feedback has effective relations with the safety participation. Safety feedback is identified as the most important safety management issue to road <b>safety</b> practices <b>and</b> it would predict the level of safety knowledge, safety motivation, <b>safety</b> compliance <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> participation. The results of this study would help the concerned agencies/orgaizations in improving their ability to assess the road <b>safety</b> indicators <b>and</b> to the future development of the safety performance management for road safety practices in these agencies...|$|R

Traditionally, {{research into}} occupational health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> has focused on <b>safety</b> culture <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> climate to explain risk-taking <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> behaviours. Managers in high-hazard industries have therefore concentrated on creating positive <b>safety</b> cultures <b>and</b> climates. Recently, I proposed that a "psychological contract for health and safety" may offer an alternative explanation for individual risk-taking <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> behaviours at work. The psychological contract is used to explain general areas of the employment relationship and has been investigated by examining the fulfilment of promises or obligations from both employees' and employers' perspectives. I saw an employee's psychological contract for health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> as perceptions <b>and</b> expectations about the employers' health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> obligations <b>and</b> promises, {{and the extent to}} which these were perceived to have been fulfilled...|$|R

Conversely, the relationship between <b>safety</b> promotion policies <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> compliance was not established in this study.

Additionally, CFSC moderates the relationships between <b>safety</b> rules <b>and</b> procedures <b>and</b> nurses <b>safety</b> participation. This study offers empirical evidence in the support of CFSC as a moderator. This contributes to the utility of SET and CLT.

40|$|Abstract: Pneumoconiosis is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} hazardous chronic health diseases in the Hong Kong construction industry. Most frontline workers lack proper education and their health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> awareness is relatively low. Therefore, management of an organization plays a momentous role to implement the control of hazards within organizations and to incorporate health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> into their operations. Personal protective equipment is designed, only after all health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> measures, to remove and to control health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> hazards. In the case of respiratory hazards, the hazard at source is impossible to entirely eliminate. Thus, wearing the personal respiratory protective equipment against the health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> illnesses becomes critical. This paper examines awareness and attitude in using the personal respiratory protec-tive equipment in the Hong Kong construction industry. Questionnaire survey and structured interviews are conducted. From the survey results, it is found that awareness and understanding of the health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> hazards, is insufficient. Moreover, workers are not familiar with the risks of the equipment fitting, <b>and</b> health <b>and</b> <b>safety.</b> Health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> aware-ness can influence health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> attitude <b>and</b> behaviour. The low awareness of health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> would make worker more vulnerable to illness. Recommendations to improve health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> awareness <b>and</b> understanding of health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> diseases are also given in this study...|$|R
