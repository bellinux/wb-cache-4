5000|$|Walls and Bridges has {{a variety}} of musical stylings and many of the lyrics make it clear that Lennon both enjoyed his new-found freedom and also missed Ono. [...] "Going Down on Love", [...] "What You Got" [...] and [...] "Bless You" [...] address his {{feelings}} toward Ono, the last one the most explicitly, while the first track that Lennon wrote when he and Pang went to New York, [...] "Surprise <b>Surprise</b> (<b>Sweet</b> Bird of Paradox)", was about Pang. [...] "Steel and Glass" [...] included a sinister riff reminiscent of [...] "How Do You Sleep?", Lennon's audio argument with Paul McCartney from the Imagine album, although the digs this time were thought to be directed at former Beatles manager Allen Klein. [...] "Scared" [...] is a haunting track exploring Lennon's fear of ageing, loneliness and the emptiness of success. The album also includes some of Lennon's most uplifting songs, namely its two singles [...] "Whatever Gets You thru the Night" [...] (which features Elton John on piano and harmony vocals) and [...] "#9 Dream" [...] (the instrumentation evokes a dream, as well as reflective Beatles songs such as [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] and [...] "Sun King"). Lennon took the title for [...] "Whatever Gets You thru the Night" [...] from a phrase uttered by TV evangelist Reverend Ike, while part of his inspiration when writing [...] "#9 Dream" [...] was George Harrison's song [...] "Try Some, Buy Some", particularly the melody played by the string section on that track. Another of the album's more upbeat songs is [...] "Beef Jerky", an R&B-inspired instrumental. [...] "Old Dirt Road" [...] uses the road as a metaphor for a point of stability in an unstable world and a life subject to variability.|$|E
5000|$|... "Surprise <b>Surprise</b> (<b>Sweet</b> Bird of Paradox)" [...] {{originally}} {{was a short}} piece, which featured Lennon on electric guitar, that later became the song's middle 8. On another demo for the song, the song had been reworked, to a similar form to the final version, featuring Lennon on acoustic guitar. When Lennon went into Record Plant to record the song, however, parts of the demos were dropped. The song features vocal overdubs from Lennon and Elton John. Lennon's piano demo for [...] "Steel and Glass" [...] has completely different lyrics to the finished version, while a rehearsal from Menlove Ave. has the song with a slower tempo and Lennon on acoustic guitar, with incomplete lyrics. During one of his frequent visits from England to visit his father during this period, eleven-year-old son Julian Lennon attended the recording sessions and they did a casual cover of the Lee Dorsey oldie [...] "Ya Ya". Lennon surprised Julian by including it as the album closer with the credit: [...] "Starring Julian Lennon on drums and Dad on piano and vocals". Pang recalled the younger Lennon's response, telling his father [...] "If I'd known, I would have played better!" [...] Lennon also {{sends a message to}} publisher Morris Levy, who was expecting Lennon's next release to be the Oldies album, in the introduction to the song ("Ya Ya" [...] was part of Levy's song catalogue, which Lennon was obligated to begin recording songs from due to a settlement of an earlier lawsuit). Cut from the album at the last minute was a track called [...] "Move Over Ms. L" [...] which was placed between [...] "Surprise Surprise" [...] and [...] "What You Got" [...] before Lennon changed the track list. It would eventually appear as the B-side to the single [...] "Stand by Me". The song would also be given to Keith Moon for his only solo album, Two Sides of the Moon. Also recorded during the session was a demo for Ringo Starr: [...] "Goodnight Vienna".|$|E

5000|$|A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court {{was one of}} the {{highlight}} films of 1949.The critics were generally complimentary with Bosley Crowther of The New York Times saying on April 8, 1949: [...] "The solid, reliable humors of Mark Twain’s “A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court,” which have already done yeoman service in two films and a Broadway musical show, have been given another going over—with eminently satisfactory results—in Paramount’s new film of the same title, which came to the Music Hall yesterday. And for this we can thank Bing Crosby, primarily and above all, because it is Bing {{in the role of the}} Yankee who gives this film its particular charm...But it is still Bing’s delightful personality, his mild <b>surprises</b> and <b>sweet</b> serenities, and his casual way of handling dialogue that makes this burlesque a success. No one in current operation could qualify, we are sure, to play the Connecticut Yankee the way the old Groaner does. Variety was not quite so enthusiastic. [...] "Picture wears the easy casualness that’s a Crosby trademark, goes about its entertaining at a leisurely pace, and generally comes off satisfactorily.

About Anansi Masters: The Anansi Masters project is developed by Vista Far Reaching Visuals (Mr. Jean Hellwig) and partners. It is designed as a public digital platform at [URL] and opened in 2007. At the website one can find information about the story character of Nanzi (or Anansi or Kweku Ananse), with English and Dutch subtitled video recordings of storytelling in several countries in different languages, educational modules about storytelling for use at schools and academies, and digital issues of the Anansi Masters Journal published since the beginning of the project. All storytelling videos are also published on Youtube. The stories of the Anansi tradition originate in Africa and were exported to other parts of the world through slave trade and migration. In Anansi Masters, the similarities and differences between the stories and storytellers, who tell in their own language, can be found. Anansi Masters initiates different activities all over the world where stories from this oral tradition can be found. The founder has the ambition to film as many stories from this tradition as possible in as many countries as possible. Anansi Masters collaborates with writers, theatre makers, filmmakers, researchers, schools and of course with many many storytellers.

60|$|For now it {{came into}} my mind that I could not very well settle there {{for the rest of}} my life; I could not, in fact, tie myself to any place without sacrificing certain other {{advantages}} I possessed; and the main thing was that by taking root I should deprive myself of the chance of looking on still other beautiful scenes and experiencing other <b>sweet</b> <b>surprises.</b> I was wishing that I had come a little earlier on the scene to have had time to borrow the key of the church and get a sight of the interior, when all at once I heard a shrill voice and a boy appeared running across the wide green space of the churchyard. A second boy followed, then another, then still others, and I saw that they were going into the church by the side door. They were choir-boys going to practice. The church was open then, and late as it was I could have half an hour inside before it was dark! The stream was spanned by an old stone bridge above the ford, and going over it I at once made my way to the great building, but even before entering it I discovered that it possessed an organ of extraordinary power and that someone was performing on it with a vengeance. Inside the noise was tremendous--a bigger noise from an organ, it seemed to me, than I had ever heard before, even at the Albert Hall and the Crystal Palace, but even more astonishing than the uproar was the sight that met my eyes. The boys, nine or ten sturdy little rustics with round sunburnt West Country faces, were playing the roughest game ever witnessed in a church. Some were engaged in a sort of flying fight, madly pursuing one another up and down the aisles and over the pews, and whenever one overtook another he would seize hold of him and they would struggle together until one was thrown and received a vigorous pommelling. Those who were not fighting were dancing to the music. It was great fun to them, and they were shouting and laughing their loudest only not a sound of it all could be heard on account of the thunderous roar of the organ which filled and seemed to make the whole building tremble. The boys took no notice of me, and seeing that there was a singularly fine west window, I went to it and stood there some time with my back to the game which was going on at the other end of the building, admiring the beautiful colours and trying to make out the subjects depicted. In the centre part, lit by the after-glow in the sky to a wonderful brilliance, was the figure of a saint, a lovely young woman in a blue robe with an abundance of loose golden-red hair and an aureole about her head. Her pale face wore a sweet and placid expression, and her eyes of a pure forget-me-not blue were looking straight into mine. As I stood there the music, or noise, ceased and a very profound silence followed--not a giggle, not a whisper from the outrageous young barbarians, and not a sound of the organist or of anyone speaking to them. Presently I became conscious of some person standing almost but not quite abreast of me, and turning sharply I found a clergyman at my side. He was the vicar, the person who had been letting himself go on the organ; a slight man with a handsome, pale, ascetic face, clean-shaven, very dark-eyed, looking more like an Italian monk or priest than an English clergyman. But although rigidly ecclesiastic in his appearance and dress, there was something curiously engaging in him, along with a subtle look which it was not easy to fathom. There was a light in his dark eyes which reminded me of a flame seen through a smoked glass or a thin black veil, and a slight restless movement about the corners of his mouth as if a smile was just on the point of breaking out. But it never quite came; he kept his gravity even when he said things which would have gone very well with a smile.|$|R
