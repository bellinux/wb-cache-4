500|$|Jackson's {{music has}} {{encompassed}} {{a broad range}} of genres. Her records from the 1980s have been described as being influenced by Prince, as her producers are ex-members of The Time. Sal Cinquemani wrote that in addition to defining Top 40 radio, she [...] "gave Prince's Minneapolis sound a distinctly feminine—and, with songs like 'What Have You Done for Me Lately?,' 'Nasty,' 'Control,' and 'Let's Wait Awhile,' a distinctly feminist—spin." [...] On Control, Richard J. Ripani documented that she, Jam and Lewis had [...] "crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility." [...] Author Rickey Vincent stated that she has often been credited for redefining the standard of popular music with the industrial-strength beats of the album. She is considered a trendsetter in pop balladry, with Richard Rischar stating [...] "the black pop ballad of the mid-1980s had been dominated by the vocal and production style that was smooth and polished, led by singers Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, and James Ingram." [...] Jackson continued her musical development by blending pop and urban music with elements of hip-hop in the nineties. This included a softer representation, articulated by lush, soulful ballads and up-tempo dance beats. She is described by music critic Greg Kot as [...] "an artist who has reshaped the sound and image of rhythm and blues" [...] within the first decade of her career. Critic Karla Peterson remarked that [...] "she is a sharp dancer, an appealing performer, and as 'That's the Way Love Goes' proves—an ace pop-song writer." [...] <b>Selected</b> <b>material</b> from the following decade has been viewed less favorably, as Sal Cinquemani comments [...] "except for maybe R.E.M., no other former superstar act has been as prolific with such diminishing commercial and creative returns." ...|$|E
