40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{relationships among}} chemical composition, <b>storage</b> <b>temperature,</b> {{and texture of}} cheese were not fully understood. In this study, the effects of composition and temperature on textural properties of eight common varieties of sliced cheese were examined. The textural properties of sliced cheeses, including firmness, cohesiveness, adhesiveness, springiness, chewiness, and resilience, were measured by texture profile analysis after storage at 4 and 25 °C for 4 [*]h. Multivariate logistic regression models were established to describe the quantitative relationships of textural properties (dependent variables) to chemical composition and <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> (independent variables) of sliced cheeses. Results showed that protein, fat, moisture, and sodium chloride contents as well as <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> significantly affected the texture of sliced cheeses (P< 0. 05).

At days 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14, samples were tested for pH, Total Viable Count (TVC), presumptive pseudomonas, E. coli, enterobacteriaceae and lactic acid bacteria. E. coli values decreased independent from <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> over time. Temperature exerted {{a significant effect on}} TVC. At 2 °C <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> an average increase of 1. 5 log cfu/g and at 3. 8 °C an increase of 2 log cfu/g was observed, depending on type of meat cut and experimental series, the differences could exceed 1 log unit by far.
