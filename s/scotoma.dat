25|$|Van Norren et al. (1998) {{could not}} find a single example in the medical {{literature}} of a <1nbsp&mW classnbsp&III laser causing eyesight damage. Mainster et al. (2003) provide one case, an 11-year-old child who temporarily damaged her eyesight by holding an approximately 5mW red laser pointer close to the eye and staring into the beam for 10 seconds, she experienced <b>scotoma</b> (a blind spot) but fully recovered after three months. Luttrull & Hallisey (1999) describe a similar case, a 34-year-old male who stared into the beam of a classIIIa 5mW red laser for 30 to 60 seconds, causing temporary central <b>scotoma</b> and visual field loss. His eyesight fully recovered within two days, {{at the time of his}} eye exam. An intravenous fundus fluorescein angiogram, a technique used by ophthalmologists to visualise the retina of the eye in fine detail, identified subtle discoloration of the fovea.|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of acute optic neuropathy include painless loss of vision which may affect either one or both eyes, reduced visual acuity, reduced color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, central <b>scotoma,</b> swollen optic disc, macular edema, or retrobulbar pain. When these symptoms occur with concurrent mucocutaneous ulcerations, they raise suspicion of acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's Disease. Progressive optic atrophy may result in decreased visual acuity or color vision. Intracranial hypertension with papilledema may be present.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia {{can occur}} during the aura {{phase of a}} {{migraine}} attack, a phase that often precedes the onset of a headache and is commonly characterized by visual disturbances. Micropsia, along with hemianopsia, quadrantopsia, <b>scotoma,</b> phosphene, teicopsia, metamorphopsia, macropsia, teleopsia, diplopia, dischromatopsia, and hallucination disturbances, {{is a type of}} aura that occurs immediately before or during the onset of a migraine headache. The symptom usually occurs less than thirty minutes before the migraine headache begins and lasts for five to twenty minutes. Only 10-20% of children with migraine headaches experience auras. Visual auras such as micropsia are most common in children with migraines.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we {{examined}} the perception of one- and two-dimensional patterns across central retinal <b>scotomas,</b> caused by age-related macular degeneration. In contrast with previous studies of disrupted visual input that used the blind spot and artificial <b>scotomas,</b> the current study used large central <b>scotomas</b> caused by physical retinal damage. Such damage is associated with atrophy and long-term cortical reorganization, and it was therefore unclear whether perceptual completion in the damaged system will be similar to that reported for artificial <b>scotomas</b> and the blind spot. In addition, the <b>scotomas</b> under study were much larger and more central than artificial <b>scotomas</b> for which perceptual completion has been reported. For 1 -D line and grating patterns, we found perceptual completion across large central <b>scotomas</b> (up to radius of 7 °), which is significantly beyond the range of perceptual completion in artificial <b>scotomas.</b> Gratings completion was better {{than that of a}} single line, and increased with bars density. The use of central <b>scotomas</b> allowed us to test the completion of 2 -D patterns that are difficult to study in peripheral vision. We found completion of two-dimensional dot arrays over large regions that improved with pattern density and regularity. The results show that in the physically damaged system the range of perceptual completion is increased compared with artificial <b>scotomas,</b> they strongly support the view of an active filling-in process rather than simply ignoring the damaged location, and they show that perceptual completion of physical <b>scotomas</b> is likely to involve cortical processing at multiple levels. We finally discuss implications of the results to the possible use of image enhancement techniques to facilitate the perception of low-vision individuals...|$|R

500|$|Chronic {{poisoning}} usually presents {{with symptoms}} affecting multiple systems, but {{is associated with}} three main types of symptoms: gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and neurological. Central nervous system and neuromuscular symptoms usually result from intense exposure, while gastrointestinal symptoms usually result from exposure over longer periods. Signs of chronic exposure include loss of short-term memory or concentration, depression, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and numbness and tingling in the extremities. Fatigue, problems with sleep, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anemia are also found in chronic lead poisoning. A [...] "lead hue" [...] of the skin with pallor and/or lividity is another feature. A blue line along the gum with bluish black edging to the teeth, known as a Burton line, is another indication of chronic lead poisoning. Children with chronic poisoning may refuse to play or may have hyperkinetic or aggressive behavior disorders.

40|$|Purpose. Three-dimensional (3 D) computer-automated {{threshold}} Amsler grid {{testing was}} used to identify and characterize <b>scotomas</b> typical of glaucoma. Methods. The 3 D test exhibits a grid {{on a computer screen}} at a preselected grayscale and angular resolution, and allows patients to trace those areas on the grid that are missing in their visual field using a touch screen. Eleven eyes in patients with an established diagnosis of glaucoma were examined according to the above protocol. A total of 23 eyes from normal subjects were used as controls. The 5 -minute test required that patients repeatedly outline <b>scotomas</b> on a touch screen with varied displays of contrast while maintaining their gaze on a central fixation marker. A 3 D depiction of the visual field defects was then obtained that was further characterized by the location, shape, extent, depth, and slope of the <b>scotomas.</b> Results. In this pilot study, the 3 D depiction of visual field loss demonstrated paracentral, superior and inferior altitudinal, and nasal step defects consistent with glaucomatous damage. The 3 D depiction showed a shape, extent, depth, and slope that are consistent with the severity of damage. Conclusions. The 3 D test identified and characterized <b>scotomas</b> typical of glaucoma. The test provides several advantages over conventional perimetry including additional information through 3 D depiction of <b>scotomas</b> with the addition of contrast sensitivity and a higher angular/spatial resolution. Improved patient compliance and reliability through shorter testing time and potential interactive accessibility and distribution over the Internet further characterize the test...|$|R

50|$|Symptoms {{typically}} appear gradually over 5 to 20 {{minutes and}} generally last fewer than 60 minutes, {{leading to the}} headache in classic migraine with aura, or resolving without consequence in acephalgic migraine. Many migraine sufferers change from scintillating <b>scotoma</b> as a prodrome to migraine to scintillating <b>scotoma</b> without migraine. The <b>scotoma</b> typically spontaneously resolves within the stated time frame, leaving few or no subsequent symptoms, though some report fatigue, nausea, and dizziness as sequelae.|$|E
50|$|Symptom-producing, or pathological, scotomata {{may be due}} to a {{wide range}} of disease processes, {{affecting}} any part of the visual system, including the retina (in particular its most sensitive portion, the macula), the optic nerve and even the visual cortex. A pathological <b>scotoma</b> may involve any part of the visual field and may be of any shape or size. A <b>scotoma</b> may include and enlarge the normal blind spot. Even a small <b>scotoma</b> that happens to affect central or macular vision will produce a severe visual disability, whereas a large <b>scotoma</b> in the more peripheral part of a visual field may go unnoticed by the bearer because of the normal reduced optical resolution in the peripheral visual field.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{used the}} {{recently}} devised three-dimensional computer-based threshold Amsler grid test to acquire and identify typical patterns of visual field defects (<b>scotomas)</b> caused by age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: Patients with AMD traced {{on a computer}} touch screen the borders of those areas on an Amsler grid that were missing from their field of vision. <b>Scotomas</b> were repeatedly outlined and recorded at different grid contrast levels. The resulting three-dimensional “hole ” in the central 25 ° of the visual field was further characterized by its slope, location, shape, and depth. The results were compared with fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms. Results: Twenty-five patients and 41 eyes were examined. The three-dimensional depictions consistently demonstrated central <b>scotomas</b> with “scallop”-shaped borders and steplike patterns, with either steep slopes {{or a combination of}} steep and shallow slopes. The steep slopes corresponded to nonexudative AMD, while the shallow slopes indicated exudative AMD. Conclusion: The three-dimensional computer-automated threshold Amsler grid tes...|$|R
50|$|Most {{cases of}} polyopia are {{accompanied}} by another neurological condition. Polyopia is often accompanied by visual field defects (such {{as the presence of}} a <b>scotoma)</b> or transient visual hallucinations. Polyopic images often form in the direction and position of such visual field defects. Current research shows that when stimuli are close to the patient’s <b>scotoma,</b> the latency of polyopic images is much shorter than if the stimuli was far from the <b>scotoma,</b> and there is a higher probability that polyopic images will result.|$|E
50|$|Many {{variations}} occur, but scintillating <b>scotoma</b> usually {{begins as}} a spot of flickering light near or {{in the center of}} the visual field, which prevents vision within the <b>scotoma</b> area. The affected area flickers but is not dark. It then gradually expands outward from the initial spot. Vision remains normal beyond the borders of the expanding scotoma(s), with objects melting into the <b>scotoma</b> area background similarly to the physiological blind spot, which means that objects may be seen better by not looking directly at them in the early stages when the spot is in or near the center. The <b>scotoma</b> area may expand to completely occupy one half of the visual area, or it may also be bilateral. It may occur as an isolated symptom without headache in acephalgic migraine.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} the preferential hyperacuity perimeter (PHP) and the Amsler grid to detect central <b>scotomas</b> in Stargardt's disease and age macular degeneration. MethodsProspective, comparative, cross-section study in which 16 patients affected with AMD and Stargardt's disease were evaluated. All patients had an optometric evaluation including refraction, best corrected visual acuity, evaluation with PHP Foresee and with the Amsler grid. The sensitivity of the macular evaluation tests (The Amsler grid and PHP) for each maculopathy was calculated. ResultsTo detect <b>scotomas</b> in both macular pathologies, the PHP sensitivity is 60 – 70 %, while the Amsler grid sensitivity is 85 – 100 %. As screening methods for maculopathies, the PHP sensitivity is 83 %, while the Amsler grid sensitivity is 93 %. ConclusionsThe Amsler grid and the PHP are both useful to detect <b>scotomas</b> in Stargardt's disease and AMD. As a disease screening method, the Amsler grid is useful in both conditions; however, the PHP is only useful in AMD, not in Stargardt's...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe reading {{strategies}} in individuals with central <b>scotomas</b> {{and more than}} one preferred retinal locus (PRL) were investigated using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope {{in order to understand the}} visual requirements that lead to the need to use more than one PRL during reading. It was found that: (1) PRL function can be deduced from variation in PRL usage for different size and length of isolated words; (2) each subject used two or more PRL to accomplish the functions of global viewing and discrimination, suggesting that these are two of the minimum requirements for reading; (3) reading strategies can change depending on the position of words in visual space; (4) line-changing strategies can revert to horizontal and vertical component movements.

40|$|Seminal work in {{the early}} nineties {{revealed}} that the visual receptive field of neurons in cat primary visual cortex can change in location and size when artificial <b>scotomas</b> are applied.

To examine this further, we estimated the pRF in twelve healthy participants while masking the central portion of the visual field. We found that the pRF changes in location and size for two differently sized artificial <b>scotomas,</b> and that these pRF dynamics are most likely due to a combination of the neuronal receptive field position and size scatter as well as modulatory feedback signals from extrastriate visual areas...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere {{is a large}} {{projection}} of neurons from Layer VI of V 1 that makes excitatory connections on LGN relay cells. It has been proposed that this circuit is involved in signal processing and thalamic sensitivity regulation. Alternatively, Crick {{has suggested that the}} circuit could be a reverberatory loop—a site for very short term (iconic) visual memory. This hypothesis is shown to be plausible if the reverberation is keyed to the onset of neurally initiated visual disruptions such as blinks and saccades. Neural mechanisms suppress perception during these events but little is known about temporal filling-in processes analogous to the mechanisms that fill-in spatial <b>scotomas.</b> Crick's reverberatory loop could provide a process for filling-in temporal <b>scotomas</b> with information acquired just before the disruption, thus maintaining the continuity of visual experience. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.
