40|$|Pena-Shokeir {{syndrome}} type I (fetal akinesia deformation sequence, FADS) is {{a mostly}} autosomal recessive lethal disorder characterised by combination of abnormal limb position, restrictive fetal movement with reduced or absent response to acoustic stimulation, growth restriction, polyhydramnios, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Limb defects like camptodactyly, rocker bottom feet and clubfoot are other prominents of the syndrome. Obstetric ultrasonographic examination of a 24 -year-old pregnant woman, consanguineous with her husband, revealed a single male fetus with contractures {{of the upper}} and the lower limbs and polyhydramnios due {{to the absence of}} swallowing, persistent flexion of the bilateral wrist, elbow joints and the knee joints consistent with Pena <b>Shokeir</b> <b>syndrome</b> phenotype. The parents were informed about the diagnosis and its poor prognosis. Fetus had no viability, therefore the termination of the pregnancy was offered to the parents and they accepted. We report the prenatal and postnatal sonographic, pathologic and genetic diagnostic features of a Pena-Shokeir syndrome case...|$|E
40|$|Description and Definition "n"n Synonym: Edward {{syndrome}} Characterized by malformations {{of multiple}} organ systems, trisomy 18 has an incidence of 3 in 10000 live births. Abnormalities detectable by ultrasound Common findings Agenesis of the corpus callosum Choroid plexus cysts Posterior fossa abnormalities Micrognathia Low-set ears Microphthalmous Hypertelorism Short radial ray Clenched hand with overlapping index finger Clubbed foot Rocker-bottom foot Renal anomalies hydronephrosis Omphalocele Diaphragmatic hernia Cryptorchidism Heart defects Single umbilical artery Intrauterine growth restriction Polyhydramnios Nuchal lucency Occasional findings Meningomyelocele Ventriculomegaly Cleft lip and plate Major differential diagnoses Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (clenched hands and intrauterine growth restriction) Pena <b>Shokeir</b> <b>syndrome</b> (pseudo-trisomy 18) Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (clenched hands and intrauterine grown restriction) Triploidy (intrauterine growth restriction) Trisomy 9 Other multiple malformation syndromes associated with intrauterine growth retardation, limb anomalies and/ or heart defects. Ultrasound diagnosis Prenatal; ultrasound diagnosis {{has been established}} in the first trimester, based on the finding of a nuchal lucency. Detectable features on the early second trimester include abnormal forearms, clenched hands, clubbed feet, omphalocele and a major heart defect. The features of trisomy 18 are detectable in 80 % of affected fetuses in the second trimester. Sonography is often used to evaluate fetuses for the prsence of trisomy 18 when choroid plexus cysts are present, or when the triple screen results in a low level of maternal serum alpha- fetoprotein, estriol and human chorionic&nbsp; gonadotropin combination. Although trisomy 18 occurs in 1 in 100 fetuses with choroid plexus cysts, if it is an isolated finding, the risk for trisomy 18 falls below 1 in 400. Documenting an open hand is very helpful as most fetuses with trisomy 18 are unable to unclench their hands. Heredity This is an autosomal trisomic syndrome. Natural history and outcome Fetuses with trisomy 18 often die in utero. Ninety percent of live- borns with this abnormality die {{in the first year of}} life. The 10 % who survive are profoundly mentally retarded and handicapped. Reference: Beryl R Benacerrafe, M. D; Ultrasound of fetal syndromes:&nbsp; (322 - 324) &nbsp; &nbsp...|$|E
