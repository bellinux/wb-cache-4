5|$|By {{this time}} the synagogue had around 1,200 member families, and over 600 {{children}} in its religious school. Wax initiated <b>some</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the congregation's religious practices. One {{was to have a}} real ram's horn shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah starting in 1954, rather than the trumpet that had been used for a number of years. Under his leadership a number of members also started having bar mitzvah ceremonies for their children, though this did not become common until the 1970s. By the 1970s he had also added Hebrew classes to the religious school.|$|E
5|$|Parashurameshvara Temple {{was built}} by the Shailodbhavas, who had Shiva as their family deity. The Shailodbhavas also {{respected}} the Shakta deities and depicted Shakta images {{on the walls of}} the temple. The temple was repaired in 1903, with <b>some</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the roof of the inner sanctum, whilst retaining most of the original structure. Being located in the eastern coast, Parashurameshvara, like other Orissan temples, was not much affected by Muslim invasions of the 12–13th centuries. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a ticketed monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} reviewed {{such areas}} as property, succession, maintenance, pensions, social welfare and tax and recommended <b>some</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the law to provide rights for qualifying cohabitees. These rights would be applied by the court on application as distinct from the 'automatic' rights of legal marriage. The commission took care not to propose anything which would equate co-habitation with marriage due to concerns that such a proposal might violate the constitutional protection of the family.|$|E

The convective acceleration (b) is an acceleration caused by <b>some</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> velocity over position, for example the speeding up or slowing down of a fluid entering a constriction or an opening, respectively. Both these terms make up the inertia terms of the 1-dimensional Saint-Venant equation.|$|R
5|$|In 1890, Wallace gave {{evidence}} {{before a}} Royal Commission investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted {{to support his}} testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. The Lancet averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend <b>some</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime, attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by The Lancet, which stated that it contained {{many of the same}} errors as his evidence given to the commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a {{reported}} US$80million, {{at the time}} the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued the group as a trio. Through <b>some</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, announcing the split on its website.|$|E
5|$|Nutria were {{introduced}} into coastal marshes from South America in the mid-1900s, and their population has since exploded into the millions. They cause serious damage to coastal marshes and may dig burrows in levees. Hence, Louisiana {{has had a}} bounty to try to reduce nutria numbers. Large American alligators, however, feed heavily on nutria, so American alligators may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them spreading east into the Everglades. Since hunting and trapping preferentially take the large American alligators that {{are the most important}} in eating nutria, <b>some</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> harvesting may be needed to capitalize on their ability to control nutria.|$|E

25|$|All the old barrack {{buildings}} were demolished in 1936 {{to allow the}} construction of the present red brick buildings.
