50|$|On December 9, 2008, the IRS gave 403(b) plan {{sponsors}} {{a one-year}} reprieve for adopting a written plan document. A 403(b) plan, {{also known as}} a tax-sheltered annuity plan, is a retirement plan for employees of specific tax-exempt organizations such as health care organizations and colleges and universities. While the relief provisions from the IRS give 403(b) a full year to adopt a written plan document, the plans still must operate in compliance with 403(b) plan requirements. If somebody has taken 403(b) plan and his age is less than 59 then he cannot initiate a withdrawal from annuity. If he wants to initiate then he has to show a triggering event such as financial hardship, disability, or <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>service.</b> The IRS also charges a mandatory 10% as federal taxes on an early withdrawal before it is additionally taxed as ordinary income.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{employers}} may disallow one, several, {{or all of}} {{the previous}} hardship causes. To maintain the tax advantage for income deferred into a 401(k), the law stipulates the restriction that unless an exception applies, money must be kept in the plan or an equivalent tax deferred plan until the employee reaches 59½ years of age. Money that is withdrawn prior to the age of 59½ typically incurs a 10% penalty tax unless a further exception applies. This penalty is on top of the [...] "ordinary income" [...] tax that has to be paid on such a withdrawal. The exceptions to the 10% penalty include: the employee's death, the employee's total and permanent disability, <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>service</b> in or after the year the employee reached age 55, substantially equal periodic payments under section 72(t), a qualified domestic relations order, and for deductible medical expenses (exceeding the 7.5% floor).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{recent study}} showed that among U. S. {{military}} personnel, mental disorders were the leading medical correlate of <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> military <b>service.</b> The reasons for this association have not been determined. The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize the risk and reasons for service separation for soldiers hospitalized with mental disorders compared with those hospitalized for other illnesses. METHOD: Population-based electronic health care data were linked with data on separations and disability. The authors constructed a cohort of 13, 971 U. S. Army soldiers first hospitalized in 1998 and followed them for up to 2 years following this first hospitalization. RESULTS: The rate of service separation 6 months after first hospitalization was 45 % among personnel whose primary hospital discharge diagnosis was a mental disorder, 27 % among those with a secondary mental disorder discharge diagnosis, and 11 % among those hospitalized for all other medical conditions. <b>Separation</b> <b>from</b> military <b>service</b> due to medical disability, misconduct and other legal problems, unauthorized work absences, behavior related to personality disorders, and alcohol rehabilitation failure was significantly more common following hospitalization for a mental disorder than for other medical conditions. Mental disorders were also significantly associated with medical separations in which there was evidence that the condition existed prior to service. CONCLUSIONS: In the military, the occupational impact of mental disorders compared with other medical conditions appears to be mediated not only by greater disease chronicity and severity but also by a variety of behavioral problems including misconduct, legal problems, unauthorized absences, and alcohol/drug-related problems. The study also points to the difficulties inherent in screening for mental disorders prior to entry into military service...|$|R
50|$|Service {{policies}} represent {{terms of}} use for a service. So, for a service to be reusable, its behavioral requirements must be expressed consistently using standardized policy expressions based on industry standard vocabularies. This type of standardization further promotes <b>separation</b> of policies <b>from</b> <b>service</b> contracts into individual policy documents, which facilitates centralized governance. In some cases, two policies, though syntactically different, might mean the same thing—therefore, design standards must dictate acceptable policy structure.|$|R
50|$|Clark {{discussed}} the oath and the affidavit separately. In three sentences, Clark held that since past actions and beliefs may impugn present fitness for duty, the affidavit was justified. The {{question for the}} oath (which reached back five years into the past) was its constitutionality, and here Clark relied heavily on United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 (1947), to answer that the oath was valid. Since the charter change had occurred seven years before, and the oath reached back only five years, the oath was also not a bill of attainder or ex post facto law. Clark distinguished United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303 (1946), which was not a general law establishing qualifications for office but which specifically named certain individuals and required their <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> government <b>service.</b>|$|R

40|$|Increases in the {{frequency}} of operations tempo have focused attention on the relationship between deployment and <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> military <b>service.</b> This retrospective study explored the association between deployment and turnover over a 10 -year period in Royal Australian Navy (RAN) personnel. Participants were 2355 males who served in the RAN during the period of the 1991 Gulf War (August 1990 -September 1991); approximately half had been deployed to that conflict. Data were collected 10 years later as part of the Australian Gulf War Veterans' Health Study. During that 10 -year period, 61 % of participants left the RAN. The likelihood of separation decreased as number of deployments increased even when controlling for age, rank, and length of service. Personnel deployed to the 1991 Gulf conflict did not have a significantly higher risk of separation. The results provide evidence that deployment is not necessarily a risk factor for separation.

Method: The prevalence of affective, anxiety, somatic, and substance use disorders was assessed in 2, 215 male Australian Navy personnel with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: The onset of a psychiatric disorder during military service was related to a 19 % greater risk of separation overall. The majority of those leaving military service did so {{in the first year}} after symptom onset.
