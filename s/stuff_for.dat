Construction of the Seneca Trading Post, a general store, began in 1833, which was a hub of activity {{at the southern end}} of the road in Quaker Bridge, supplying <b>stuff</b> <b>for</b> tourists of the area until 1964. The building was intentionally burned in 1965. NY280 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to a short roadway connecting NY17, then an at-grade highway, to the now-submerged hamlets of Cold Spring and Quaker Bridge along the western bank of the Allegheny River. The designation ended in Quaker Bridge, a community situated on the eastern riverbank near the modern junction of NY280 and Allegany State Park Route3 in the town of Elko. NY280 remained relatively unchanged up through the early 1960s.|$|E

[...] In a simultaneous review of all four MacFarlane programs, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C- stating, [...] "Turning Miley Cyrus into a Small Wonder parody was fitfully amusing, {{but the rest of the}} Hannah Montana material was ridiculously non-specific, filled with the kinds of jokes everyone made about Cyrus a few years ago." [...] VanDerWerff praised the action sequence at the end {{of the episode}}, however, calling it [...] "high quality <b>stuff</b> <b>for</b> the show."

We created details down to the railings and all the human-scale <b>stuff.</b> ... <b>For</b> the shots in which we were destroying them, we had to have the internals as well – the hallways, the storage areas." [...] Many of the shots of Washington, D.C. were digitally created due to numerous flight restrictions in the city which necessitated that locations be recreated by computer.
