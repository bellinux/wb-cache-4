5000|$|VELUX 5 Oceans Race - {{formerly}} known as the BOC Challenge and later the Around Alone, this race started in 1982 with 17 entries. It is a <b>single-handed</b> <b>race</b> around the world, originally with 4 legs but now with 3.|$|E
5000|$|Burns recalls [...] "2 W-21s sailed in the <b>single-handed</b> <b>race</b> from San Francisco to Kauai and {{the most}} notorious W-21 was Little Rascal sailed by Amy Boyer to victory in the women's {{division}} of the Mini-Transat race from Penzance England to Tenerife (Canary Islands) and thence to Antigua, West Indies." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{concept for}} the race began in 1975, by Mr. W. David Kingery. He {{was a member of}} the Beverly Yacht Club, (Marion, MA), on the Board of Governors of the Blue Water Sailing Club, and {{interested}} in doing a <b>single-handed</b> <b>race</b> from England to Newport, Rhode Island. The original concept was an organized race to Bermuda for cruising yachts and family sailors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Single-handed</b> <b>racing</b> {{continued}} to develop {{with the creation}} in 1977 of the Mini-Transat, a <b>single-handed</b> transatlantic <b>race</b> for boats smaller than 6.5 m. The first edition started from Penzance, UK; today it runs from Douarnenez, France, to Guadeloupe.|$|R
50|$|Single-handed sailing {{has become}} a major {{competitive}} sport, {{and there are a number}} of prominent <b>single-handed</b> offshore <b>races.</b> The Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race (OSTAR) and the Route du Rhum are trans-Atlantic <b>single-handed</b> <b>races.</b> The single handed transpac (SHTP) starts off Tiburon in the San Francisco Bay, and ends in Hanalei Bay, Kauai. Round-the-world yacht racing began with the single-handed Sunday Times Golden Globe Race. Two modern round-the-world races descended from this event are the VELUX 5 Oceans Race (Around Alone), which is run in several stages with stops in between, and the Vendée Globe, a non-stop race around the world and perhaps the ultimate event in single-handed sailing. Many <b>single-handed</b> <b>races</b> make use of Open 50 and Open 60 boats.|$|R
50|$|Philippe Jeantot (born 8 May 1952 in Antananarivo, Madagascar) is a French former {{deep sea}} diver, who {{achieved}} {{recognition as a}} sailor for long-distance, <b>single-handed</b> <b>racing</b> and record-setting. He founded the Vendée Globe, a single-handed, round-the-world, non-stop yacht race.|$|R
50|$|Groupama 3 was reconfigured for Franck Cammas {{to enter}} the 9th edition of the single handed Route de Rhum 2010 which started 31 October 2010. Groupama 3 {{was the first to}} finish in 9 days, 3 hours, 14 minutes and 47 seconds. The Route de Rhum takes place once every four years, is a <b>single-handed</b> <b>race</b> across the Atlantic {{starting}} in Saint-Malo, France and finishing in Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe in the Caribbean.|$|E
50|$|Alex Pella (born 2 November 1972) is a Spanish skipper and sailor. In 2014 {{he became}} the first and only Spanish to win a transoceanic <b>single-handed</b> <b>race,</b> the Route du Rhum. Alex Pella made history once again, on the 26th of January 2017, when he broke, {{with the rest of the}} team, the {{absolute}} round-the-world speed sailing record, known as the Jules Verne Trophy., aboard the sophisticated maxi-multihull IDEC 3. They circumnavigated the planet in 40 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes and 30 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|Ostar - first held in 1960, {{organised}} by the Royal Western Yacht Club, the Ostar {{runs from}} Plymouth to Newport (in 1960 {{the finish line}} was in New York). It is a <b>single-handed</b> <b>race,</b> against the prevailing wind and current in the North Atlantic. The race is held every 4 years but has become an amateur race in the early 21st century. Originally, the Ostar was the main race for offshore sailors, but has meanwhile lost its status to the Route du Rhum. The race covers about 3,000 miles.|$|E
50|$|Michel Desjoyeaux (born 16 July 1965, in Concarneau) is a French sailor, {{known for}} {{competing}} successfully in several long-distance <b>single-handed</b> <b>races.</b> He won the Vendée Globe race in 2000-01 and 2008-09, {{making him the}} only person to win that race more than once.|$|R

50|$|The RS700 is a <b>single-handed</b> <b>racing</b> dinghy {{built by}} RS Racing and {{designed}} in 2000 by Nick Peters and Alex Southon {{as part of}} the RS series and built in 2001. It is raced in many sailing clubs around Britain, with a PY number of 850 and a D-PN of 73.3.|$|R
5000|$|Organised single-handed yacht racing was {{pioneered by}} Britons [...] "Blondie" [...] Hasler and Francis Chichester, who {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a <b>single-handed</b> <b>race</b> across the Atlantic Ocean. This was a revolutionary concept at the time, as the idea was thought to be extremely impractical, particularly in the adverse conditions of their proposed route—a westward crossing of the north Atlantic Ocean. Nevertheless, their original half-crown bet on first place developed into the first single-handed transatlantic yacht race, the OSTAR, which was held in 1960. The race was a success, and was won in 40 days by Chichester, then aged 58, in Gipsy Moth III; Hasler finished second, in 48 days, sailing the junk-rigged Jester. Hasler's wind-vane self-steering gear revolutionised short-handed sailing, and his other major innovation—using a junk rig for safer and more manageable shorthanded sailing—influenced many subsequent sailors. [...] Chichester placed second in the second running of the race four years later. The winner on that occasion, Eric Tabarly, sailed in the first ever boat specifically designed for single-handed ocean racing, the 44 ft ketch Pen Duick II.|$|E
50|$|South African yacht clubs organise the South Atlantic Race (the former Cape to Rio race), the Governor's Cup from Cape Town to St. Helena Island, and a {{race between}} Durban and Mauritius. <b>Single-handed</b> ocean yacht <b>racing</b> {{began with the}} race across the Atlantic Ocean by William Albert Andrews and Josiah W. Lawlor in 1891; however, the first regular <b>single-handed</b> ocean <b>race</b> was the Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race, first held in 1960. The first round-the-world yacht race was the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race of 1968-1969, which was also a single-handed race; this {{inspired}} the present-day VELUX 5 Oceans Race (formerly the BOC Challenge / Around Alone) and the Vendée Globe. <b>Single-handed</b> <b>racing</b> has seen a great boom in popularity in recent years.|$|R

50|$|Today, {{there are}} several major races held {{regularly}} along the clipper route. The Volvo Ocean Race is a crewed race with stops which sails the clipper route every four years. Two <b>single-handed</b> <b>races,</b> inspired by Chichester and the Golden Globe race, are the Around Alone, which circumnavigates with stops, and the Vendée Globe, which is non-stop.|$|R

50|$|The Laser 4.7 {{has been}} {{increasing}} in popularity around the world since the late 1990s. In some areas it is less popular than the Byte dinghy, a very similar class also designed as a youth <b>single-handed</b> <b>racing</b> trainer, but the interchangeability of the rigs of the Laser series has always made them popular. It is popular among youth sailors graduating from the Optimist sailing dinghy, and many 4.7 sailors graduate to the Laser Radial as they progress their sailing abilities.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Single-handed</b> Trans-Atlantic <b>Race</b> was {{conceived}} by Herbert [...] "Blondie" [...] Hasler in 1956. The {{whole idea of}} a <b>single-handed</b> ocean yacht <b>race</b> was a revolutionary concept at the time, as the idea {{was thought to be}} extremely impractical; but this was especially true given the adverse conditions of their proposed route — a westward crossing of the north Atlantic Ocean, against the prevailing winds.|$|R

50|$|Stringent rules {{apply to}} <b>single-handed</b> <b>races</b> and speed records. As with any sailing race, the voyage must be {{completed}} under sail, {{and the boat}} must be operated and powered by wind and muscle-power alone (no electric or hydraulic winches). Some races are carried out in stages, where repairs and resupply may be carried out at the intermediate ports of call; in non-stop races and record attempts, no outside assistance is permitted, whether {{in the form of}} a tow, repairs, or supplies. However, anchoring to make repairs under one's own resources is generally permitted.|$|R

50|$|Given {{the failure}} of most {{starters}} and the tragic outcome of Crowhurst's voyage, considerable controversy was raised over the race and its organisation. No follow-up race was held for some time. However, in 1982 the BOC Challenge race was organised; this <b>single-handed</b> round-the-world <b>race</b> with stops {{was inspired by the}} Golden Globe and has been held every four years since. In 1989, Philippe Jeantot founded the Vendée Globe <b>race,</b> a non-stop, <b>single-handed,</b> round-the-world <b>race.</b> Essentially the successor to the Golden Globe, this race is also held every four years and has attracted public following for the sport.|$|R
2500|$|The BOC Challenge {{race was}} {{established}} in 1982, with main sponsorship from BOC Gases. [...] The race {{was inspired by the}} Golden Globe Race, which was the first <b>single-handed</b> round-the-world yacht <b>race.</b> [...] Although the Golden Globe was a non-stop race, the BOC Challenge concept was for a <b>single-handed</b> round-the-world <b>race,</b> to be run in stages (in contrast to the Vendée Globe, which is non-stop). [...] As the longest single-handed event in the world, it is regarded as one of sailing's ultimate challenges.|$|R
50|$|In its deep-fin configuration, the Sadler 25 was a {{successful}} cruiser-racer which quickly became popular in yacht clubs throughout the U.K, and had many successes in longer {{events such as the}} Round Britain and <b>Single-handed</b> Trans-Atlantic <b>races.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Observer <b>Single-handed</b> Trans-Atlantic <b>Race</b> of 1960 was a {{milestone}} in sailing, being the first <b>single-handed</b> ocean yacht <b>race.</b> 115 people {{expressed an interest in}} the race, and there were eight entries, of whom five actually took part. Only four were at the starting line on June 11, however, as Jean Lacombe arrived late and started three days after the others. All of the boats were monohulls; this was to be the only edition of the race without multihulls. It was also the only edition of the race sailed from Plymouth to New York City.|$|R
50|$|After {{five major}} battles and {{seventeen}} minor engagements only two men survived without being hospitalized or killed.

50|$|Hasler sought {{sponsorship}} for a race, but by 1959, no-one {{had been}} prepared to back the race. Finally, though, The Observer newspaper provided sponsorship, and in 1960, under {{the management of the}} Royal Western Yacht Club of England, the Observer <b>Single-handed</b> Trans-Atlantic <b>Race,</b> or OSTAR, was on.|$|R
5000|$|The FX-One is an import {{from the}} France-based Hobie Cat Europe company.
