5000|$|<b>Surgical</b> <b>diathermy</b> {{is usually}} {{better known as}} [...] "electrosurgery". (It is also {{referred}} to occasionally as [...] "electrocautery", but see disambiguation below.) Electrosurgery and <b>surgical</b> <b>diathermy</b> involve the use of high-frequency A.C. electric current in surgery as either a cutting modality, or else to cauterize small blood vessels to stop bleeding. This technique induces localized tissue burning and damage, the zone of which {{is controlled by the}} frequency and power of the device.|$|E

For the {{academic}} year 1950-1951 he was a visiting professor at the Wilmer Eye Institute, where he performed experiments on rabbits to {{study the effects of}} steroids on corneal scarring and also taught optics and refraction to the residents. In September 1952 he reported on a newly defined syndrome (cystoid macular edema aka Irvine-Gass syndrome) following cataract surgery, based upon a clinical study of 2000 patients. In the late 1950s he studied <b>surgical</b> <b>diathermy</b> for retinal detachments and its effects on the vitreous and other ocular tissues.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a medical {{alternative}} to <b>surgical</b> ovarian <b>diathermy</b> (OD) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) more mechanistic information is required about OD. We therefore studied the cellular, molecular and vascular effects of diathermy on the ovary using an established ovine model of PCOS. Pregnant sheep were treated twice weekly with testosterone propionate (100 mg) from day 30 – 100 gestation. Their female offspring (n = 12) were studied during their second breeding season when the PCOS-like phenotype, with anovulation, is fully manifest. In one group (n = 4) one ovary underwent diathermy and it was collected and compared to the contralateral ovary after 24 hours. In another group a treatment PCOS cohort underwent diathermy (n = 4) and the ovaries were collected and compared to the control PCOS cohort (n = 4) after 5 weeks. Ovarian vascular indices were measured using contrast-enhanced ultrasound and colour Doppler before, immediately after, 24 hours and five weeks after diathermy. Antral follicles were assessed by immunohistochemistry and ovarian stromal gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR 24 hours and 5 weeks after diathermy. Diathermy increased follicular atresia (P, 0. 05) and reduced antral follicle numbers after 5 weeks (P, 0. 05). There {{was an increase in}} stromal CCL 2 expression 24 hours after diathermy (P, 0. 01) but no alteration in inflammatory indices at 5 weeks. Immediately after diathermy there was increased microbubble transit time in the ovarian microvasculature (P = 0. 05) but this was not seen at 24 hours. However 24 hours after diathermy there was a reduction in the stromal Doppler blood flow signa...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} this {{retrospective}} case review were {{to analyze the}} long-term results of surgery for petrous temporal bone cholesteatomas and to propose a new classification system for these lesions. Patients with a surgically confirmed petrous temporal bone cholesteatoma were treated at Addenbrooke's Hospital, a tertiary referral center. Postoperative facial function, hearing, residual/recurrent cholesteatoma, and other complications were assessed in relation to preoperative signs, intraoperative findings, and surgical approach. Between 1983 and 2004, 43 patients were treated. There were no perioperative deaths. There was no long-term recurrence in 95. 4 % of the patients, possibly because of meticulous <b>surgical</b> technique, bipolar <b>diathermy,</b> {{and use of the}} laser to denature the cholesteatoma matrix that was adherent to the dura. At presentation, 95 % of the patients had no socially useful hearing in the affected ear. Facial nerve function, however, was usually preserved. Both direct anastomosis and nerve grafting can improve facial nerve function from House-Brackmann grade VI to grade III if the palsy is not longstanding. Four patients had cerebrospinal fluid leakage; other complications were rare. The proposed classification facilitates surgical planning and predicts the postoperative outcome with regards to hearing...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Diathermy is an {{integral}} part of many modern <b>surgical</b> procedures. While <b>diathermy</b> is generally accepted as ‘safe’, electrosurgery-induced injuries are among the more common causes for malpractice litigation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the awareness among surgeons of the principles, risks, precautions and appropriate use of diathermy. Methods: All surgeons employed from Senior House Officer (SHO) to Consultant grade in two teaching hospitals were surveyed. Sixty-three surgeons were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire, which recorded level of training and addressed competence in principles, hazards, and precautions to be taken with diathermy. Results: Eight Consultants, 5 Specialist Registrars, 19 Registrars and 13 SHO's responded (71 % response). All but three subspecialties were represented. Eighty-two percent (37 / 45) had no formal diathermy training. Despite 89 % (40 / 45) of surgeons regarding diathermy as a safe instrument, 56 % felt they had inadequate understanding of the principles and failed to demonstrate an appropriate awareness of the potential risks. Fifty seven percent exhibited a dangerous lack of awareness in managing equipment not yielding the desired effect and 22 % were unaware of any patient groups requiring special caution. Only 42 % wanted formal training. Conclusion: Our results show a dearth of awareness among surgeons regarding diathermy. Given our findings, we urge a shift in attitude towards diathermy, with surgeons adopting a more cautious and safe approach to diathermy use. We recommend that formal training be introduced as a hospital based initiative...|$|R

40|$|During {{surgery for}} chronic calculous {{cholecystitis}} in 52 patients after the morphological confirmation of hepatic steatosis we have carried out surgical correction of structural and functional {{changes in the}} liver with point electrode of <b>surgical</b> <b>diathermy</b> machine in a checkerboard pattern on the front surface of {{the right and left}} lobes of the liver in each zone with reduced electrical potential. Postoperatively, the patients received a range of rehabilitation. Long-term results show that the use of medical and surgical correction of structural and functional abnormalities of the liver at the time of cholecystectomy provides improvement in the liver, which shows a decrease of 76. 9 % of its morphological changes and functional state. The result has been the development of ways to improve the results of surgical treatment of patients with chronic calculous cholecystitis, which reduced the incidence of postoperative complications and improve quality of life in 92. 3 % of patients...|$|E
40|$|AIM: Milligan-Morgan {{operation}} {{is still considered}} the treatment of choice for IV-degree haemorrhoids: it is frequently associated with significant postoperative pain and prolonged hospital stay. Many instruments were conceived to reduce these complications, such as the LigaSure™ (LS) system, a combination of radiofrequency and pressure that seems mainly effective where a large tissue demolition is required. This randomized study is METHODS: Fifty-two patients with IV-degree hemorrhoids {{were randomly assigned to}} two different <b>surgical</b> treatments (conventional <b>diathermy</b> vs. LigaSure™ hemorrhoidectomy). They were evaluated {{on the basis of the}} following main outcomes: mean operative time, postoperative pain, day of discharge early and late complications. The time of recovery of work was also assessed. All patients had a minimum follow-up of twelve months (range 12 - 24). All data were statistically evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were treated by conventional diathermy, 25 by LigaSure™. The mean operative time was significantly shorter in LS, such as postoperative pain, mainly lower on the third and fourth postoperative day: moreover pain disappeared earlier in LS than CD. The time off-work was shorter in LS, while there was no difference in hospital stay and overall complications rate. CONCLUSION: This randomized prospective controlled trial confirms, according to other large trials in literature, the benefits of the LigaSure™ hemorrhoidectomy over conventional diathermy when a large tissue demolition is required, supporting the use of this device as treatment of choice in IV degree hemorrhoids, even if the procedure is more expensive than conventional operation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Currently clomiphene citrate is the first-linetreatment {{to induce}} {{ovulation}} {{in women with}} polycystic ovariansyndrome (PCOS). Surgical therapy with laparoscopicovarian drilling (LOD) may avoid or {{reduce the need for}} gonadotropins. Objective: To determine the effectiveness and safety of LODcompared with ovulation induction in subfertile women withclomiphene-resistant PCOS. Search Strategy: A systematic search was performed on Pub-Med (1966 to August 2007), the Ovid database (1966 to August 2007), and EMBASE (1974 - 2007). The search terms included:infertility, menstrual disorder, hirsutism, PCOS, <b>surgical</b> intervention,electrocautery, electrocoagulation, <b>diathermy,</b> drilling,and laparoscopic ovarian drilling, ovulation, pregnancy rate,post operation adhesions and ovarian blood flow. Selection Criteria: Randomized controlled trials of womenwith clomiphene-resistant PCOS who were treated with LODto induce ovulation were included. Data Collection and Analysis: 3141 patients from 35 trialspreformed in different geographic settings were included. Alltrials were assessed for quality criteria. We included those trialswhich followed hormonal changes, ovulation, and pregnancyrates after LOD. The primary outcomes measured werehormonal changes, ovulation, and pregnancy rates as well asovarian artery blood flow, and the secondary outcome was rateof pelvic organ adhesion. Main Results: The overall ovulation rate after LOD was 79. 2 % (74. 9 %- 83. 5 % 95 % CI). Of all women who ovulatedonly 66. 6 % (60. 8 %- 72. 4 % 95 % CI) conceived. The mean periadnexaladhesion rate was 22. 7 % (21. 4 %- 24 % 95 % CI). Conclusion: Compared with medical therapy, LOD has manyadvantages including: to be done once, no need for intensivemonitoring, no chance of multiple pregnancy or ovarianhyperstimulation syndrome. LOD effectively decreases ovarianandrogens and improves folliculogenesis and increases chanceof ovulation and pregnancy rate. Finally, in vitro fertilisationshould be considered as the last resort...|$|R
40|$|A {{big problem}} {{in the health care}} sector today are the infections caused by {{airborne}} bacteria-carrying particles during surgeries. About 2 to 5 % of all patient undergoing surgery are affected by infections caused by the surgery. The aim of this paper is therefore to gather and then analyze data of particle concentrations and colony forming units (CFUs) during a surgery in a mixed airflow ventilated operating theater. The focus of the analysis was especially on the effect on the <b>surgical</b> smoke from <b>diathermy</b> and the emittance through surgical clothes. The necessary particle data was acquired with three particle counters and one CFUsampler during a rectum extirpation. Particles of sizes between 0. 02 and 10 μm were investigated and five CFU samplings were performed during the surgery that took almost 4 hours. An air cleaner was also put on every second hour in order to see any improvements. The report shows a higher CFU value before the surgery, during the patient preparation (13 CFU/m 3) than during the surgery itself (5 CFU/m 3), and a maximum particle amount of 102 120 per cm 3 was detected at a moment during surgery when electrosurgical equipment were in use. The smoke produced by electrosurgical equipment is hence one relevant factor for the particle impact on the environment. The study concludes that the routines before the surgery needs to be optimized in order to minimize the infection risks from airborne bacteria. For example a "quiet minute" could be introduced before the body opening to let the ventilation dilute the room from hazardous particles from the preparations. Furthermore, a tendency shows that the clothing systems source strengths from previous research might be exaggerated, but further investigations are needed to confirm this. Keywords...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cochlear {{implants}} are surgically inserted {{electrical devices}} that enable severely or profoundly deaf individuals to interpret sounds from their environment and communicate more effectively. As {{a result of}} their electrical nature, they are susceptible to electromagnetic interference and can be damaged by excessive electrical energy. <b>Surgical</b> <b>diathermy</b> is one source of such potentially damaging energy. The British Cochlear Implant Group guidelines advise that monopolar diathermy should not be used {{in the head and neck}} region in patients with cochlear implants and that bipolar diathermy should not be used within 2 cm of the implant ([URL] METHODS: A questionnaire was provided to 36 surgeons working in different specialties in the head and neck region, inquiring as to their knowledge of the safety considerations when using diathermy in cochlear implant patients. Thirty-five surgeons provided responses. RESULTS: Overall, 77 % of the respondents were unaware of the existence of published guidelines. Even when given an option to seek advice, 11 % erroneously felt it was safe to use monopolar diathermy above the clavicles with a cochlear implant in situ and 49 % felt that there was no restriction on the use of bipolar diathermy. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant deficit in the knowledge of safe operating practice in the rapidly expanding population of patients with cochlear implants which threatens patient safety. Through this publication we aim to increase awareness of these guidelines among members of the surgical community and this paper is intended to act as a point of reference to link through to the published safety guidelines...|$|E
