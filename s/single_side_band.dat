40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a design scheme of wide band frequency synthesizer based on PLL, which will use instead of that being used at VLBI observation station of Shanghai Astronomical Observatory. The synthesizer allows a frequency range of between 500 MHz to 1 GHz. And {{it is the}} {{key part of the}} BBC (Base Band Converter), which can produce high quality local oscillator signal used in SSB (<b>Single</b> <b>Sided</b> <b>Band)</b> mixer. As frequency synthesizer can generate a substantial amount of frequency signals which have the same precision and stability with the reference frequency source, therefore it is widely used in RF transceiver circuit. A PLL Synthesizer chip ADF 4360 - 7 is used in this system too. This integrated chip has many advantages, such as small size, low power consumption, control convenience, superior performance, and so on. These have been verified in the process of circuit testing. In the first two chapter of the thesis, the principle and configuration of VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometer) are introduced. Then, in chapter 3, the PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) and frequency synthesizer are studied. Chapter 4, the most import part, introduces the development process of PLL circuit and interface circuit. The entire development process is divided into hardware and software parts. The last part of this paper draws a conclusion of the entire design. 本文介绍了一种以后可用于替代上海天文台VLBI观测站中的宽频带锁相环频率合成器方案，并介绍了具体的开发过程。 500 ~ 1000 MHz合成器是VLBI观测站中基带转换器（BBC）的重要组成部分，它提供单边带混频器（SSB）所需的高稳定度本振信号。 由于频率合成器可以产生大量与基准参考频率源具有同样高精度和稳定度的频率信号，故而广泛应用于射频电路中收发信机的本振源。本设计中就采用了ADI公司推出的一款锁相环频率合成器芯片ADF 4360 - 7 。这种集成的频率合成器芯片具有体积小、功耗低、控制方便、性能优越等优点，这些都在电路测试过程中得到了验证。 本文前两章介绍了VLBI技术的基本工作原理及其重要组成部分。第三章介绍了锁相环技术和频率合成技术。第四章详细介绍了锁相环频率合成器电路和单片机接口电路的开发过程，整个开发过程分为硬件部分和软件部分。最后对整个开发过程做出了总结...|$|R

50|$|DSB-SC is {{basically}} an amplitude modulation wave without the carrier, therefore reducing power waste, {{giving it a}} 100% efficiency. This is an increase compared to normal AM transmission (DSB), which has a maximum efficiency of 33.333%, since 2/3 of the power is in the carrier which carries no intelligence, and each sideband carries the same information. <b>Single</b> <b>Side</b> <b>Band</b> (SSB) Suppressed Carrier is 100% efficient.|$|E

25|$|The line {{shape of}} the phonon <b>side</b> <b>band</b> {{is that of a}} Poisson {{distribution}} as it expresses a discrete number of events, electronic transitions with phonons, during a period of time.

5000|$|Single {{sideband}} {{transmission is}} a form of amplitude modulation but in effect filters the result of modulation. An amplitude-modulated signal has frequency components both above and below the carrier frequency. If one set of these components is eliminated as well as the residual carrier, only the remaining set is transmitted. This saves power in the transmission, as roughly 2/3 of the energy sent by an AM signal is unnecessary to recover the information contained on it. It also saves [...] "bandwidth", allowing about one-half the carrier frequency spacing to be used. The drawback is that the receiver is more complicated, since it must re-recreate the carrier to recover the signal. Small errors in the detector process can greatly affect the pitch of the received signal, so <b>single</b> <b>side</b> <b>band</b> is not usual for music or general broadcast. <b>Single</b> <b>side</b> <b>band</b> is used for long-range voice communications by ships and aircraft, Citizen's Band, and amateur radio operators. LSB (lower sideband) is generally used below 9 MHz and USB (upper sideband) above 9 MHz.|$|E

This is being complemented by handheld radios in some barangays which the municipality used for transmitting messages to these areas. Cabanglasan’s populace is also kept abreast of recent information which is of regional and/or national significance through two Television channels which signal covered the municipality. These are the ABS-CBN (Channel 2) and GMA (Channel 12). AM and FM Band radio Stations from Malaybalay, Valencia, Cagayan and Davao also reached the municipality.

5000|$|In {{the early}} stages of the run up to the final legislation, most of the pro-C.B. lobby wanted the {{government}} to legislate around the U.S. standard C.B. system, primarily due to the large user base that already existed. The UK government made it clear from the outset that legislation for use of this equipment would be unlikely. Interference problems associated with badly calibrated amplitude modulated (AM) or <b>Single</b> <b>Side</b> <b>Band</b> (SSB) equipment were cited as the main factor, and it was made clear that if any system was legalised it would be frequency modulated (FM). The C.B. lobby argued that interference from AM was unlikely to occur from the use of original unmodifed AM radio equipment, a view initially rejected but later accepted by the Ministry of Defence. [...] Many active and potential users continued in their insistence on a 27 MHz system, although for a locally available Citizen's Band system, the 27 MHz concept was not universally endorsed.|$|E
