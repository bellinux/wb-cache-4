Cement-job designers used density-reduction additives, reactive flushes, and cement-set accelerators to overcome the tendency of the formation to take the slurry away from the casing. The drilling contractor also reduced the rate of pen-etration and drilling-fluid pumping rates to help avoid creating a wellbore of great volume that had to be filled with cement.

In the paper, casing axial force and wellhead movement are calculated and compared in regard to moments that free sections of <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> appear.

The moment that <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> free section comes into being has great influence on wellhead movement, so it is discussed in detail. According to comprehensive investigation on deep well and ultra-deep well accidents, wellhead growth {{is based on the}} fact that before production the cement sheath of <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> has already failed, and during production wellhead grows up due to wellbore temperature increases. The most possible reason of <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> cement sheath failure is bad cement job quality. Bad cement sheath cannot support casing axial loads and separates from casing.

The study has two major aims: (i) {{discussion of the}} current state of the art of modelling FSI in gas turbine engines and (ii) development of a “tuned” one-way FSI model of a vibrating turbine blade to investigate the correlation between the pressure at the turbine <b>casing</b> <b>surface</b> and the vibrating blade motion.

40|$|Practical {{aspects of}} the well {{construction}} show {{that the use of}} conventional cementing materials do not always provide the necessary level of quality of well casing when the requirements to resources conservation are enhanced. This is true for such complex geological conditions as the alternation of beds with different formation pressures, low fracturing pressure gradients, drilling with ERD tc. The main problems in well casing under these conditions are the losses of cement slurries, low cement top, low-quality formation isolation, and as the result of this – the emergence of cross-flows. The high quality of well casing will be provided only by means of safe contact between cement stone and limiting <b>surfaces</b> (<b>casing</b> and rock), therefore to use expansion materials for cementing is a well-recognized method. Thus, it is obvious that their application does not give positive results for intervals with a thick filter cake or intervals with cavities, i. e. where space for expansion is greater than the magnitude of the expansion. At the same time it is very challenging to create high-quality cement in formations with abnormally low formation pressure or low fracture gradient. The solution of this problem is the use of lightweight cements, which scarcely expand while hardening. This {{is due to the fact}} that lightweight cement slurries are generally obtained by increasing the content of grouting fluid in the solution, resulting in increase of the distance between the crystal hydrates – hardening products, that leads to decrease of crystallization pressure of expansion agents on the space frame of the cement stone]. Moreover, such works as secondary reservoir developing (perforation), well completion and fracturing operations create high dynamic load on the cement stone, which leads to its destruction. The stone can be completely destroyed, that often causes premature flooding of wells and incurring additional costs. In this regard, it is necessary to improve the formulation of oil-well cement in order to enhance the properties of the stone in relation to high dynamic loads. Thus, the crucial task is to create lightweight expanded cements with improved processing properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{explains}} a steady-state method of measuring convective {{heat transfer coefficient}} on the casing of an axial flow turbine. The goal is to develop an accurate steady-state heat transfer method for the comparison of various <b>casing</b> <b>surface</b> and tip designs used for turbine performance improvements. The free-stream reference temperature, especially in the tip gap region of the casing varies monotonically from the rotor inlet to rotor exit due to work extraction in the stage. In a heat transfer problem of this nature, {{the definition of the}} free-stream temperature is not as straight forward as constant free-stream temperature type problems. The accurate determination of the convective heat transfer coefficient strongly depends on the magnitude of the local free-stream reference temperature varying in axial direction, from the rotor inlet to exit. The current study explains a strategy for the simultaneous determination of the steady-state heat transfer coefficient and free-stream reference temperature on the smooth casing of a single stage rotating turbine facility. The heat transfer approach is also applicable to patterned <b>casing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> A detailed uncertainty analysis follows {{a detailed description of the}} casing heat transfer measurements.

Most permeability values exceed intact cement permeability, consistent with the presence of cracks or other defects in the formation/cement/casing interface.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe {{increased}} awareness regarding wellhead fatigue {{has led to}} an ongoing joint industry project led by Det Norske Veritas (DNV). There is lack of a standardized procedure of performing a wellhead fatigue analysis. The joint industry project aims to develop a new recommended practice in how to perform a thorough wellhead fatigue analysis. A PhD written by Lorents Reinås studies the <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> cement boundary condition and its effects on the fatigue analytical models. It proves that the cement level between the conductor and the <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> is a sensitive input parameter in terms of fatigue calculations. This thesis will investigate how to detect this particular cement level in large sized casings, i. e. 20 ”, by utilizing existing technology. Common practice is to cement the <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> {{all the way up to}} the mudline. However, the actual cement level is never measured. Pressure testing, displacement calculations and cement returns is the common documentation of a successful cement job, however none of this can provide sufficient information to document the cement height. By locating this cement level, one could provide a more accurate fatigue calculation. The conservative assumptions used in fatigue calculation today provides conservative fatigue estimates. By not knowing, one have to perform preventive measures. The reason for wanting to detect this cement level is to enable a better utilization of the wellhead. The industry provides several methods of locating top of cement, but not many are compatible with logging in large sized casings. After investigating the most common cement evaluation methods available, some of the existing methods proves to support logging in 20 ” surface casings...|$|E

40|$|The {{top hole}} section in an {{offshore}} well is conventionally drilled riserless utilizing seawater with high viscosity sweeps for cuttings removal. In recent years, {{the possibility of}} eliminating the pilot hole and setting the <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> below shallow gas or shallow water flow zones has been investigated. This would allow for setting the <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> below potential problem zones, {{so that they do}} not cause problems deeper in the well. Furthermore this could provide sufficient formation strength at the casing shoe, which can open for reducing the number of subsequent casing strings. In order to safely penetrate a shallow gas zone without drilling a pilot hole with dynamic kill possibilities, weighted mud must be utilized when using a conventional top hole drilling system. Owing to {{the fact that this is}} done riserless, which results in huge mud losses to seabed, alternative methods should be considered to avoid the "pump and dump" strategy. Drilling the top hole section whilst circulating the drilling fluid back to the rig can be achieved by utilizing the riserless mud recovery (RMR) system or the low riser return system (LRRS). These new "dual-gradient" systems have a significant benefit in terms of avoiding "pump and dump" when drilling the top hole section. Well barrier designs have been proposed which incorporate techniques and solutions to handling shallow gas with regards to barrier requirements, including procedures for handling the problem of gas trapped between the intermediate casing and <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> (trapped annuli). The LRRS system is primarily intended for dual-gradient drilling with a BOP, but can be modified for use in top hole drilling. However, seeing that this system involves utilizing a riser, this system will not be approved for top hole drilling on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). Based on my studies of different techniques of tackling shallow gas in the top hole section, it is found that the RMR system is favorable for eliminating the pilot hole and setting the <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> below a shallow gas or shallow water flow zone in a safe and time-efficient manner. The riserless return system enables return of fluid and cuttings in a closed system. Since weighted mud is used the risk of shallow gas influx is reduced compared to conventional riserless drilling. Owing to the fact that the return is routed to the platform, shallow gas is a cause of concern. The existing regulations for drilling on the NCS do not allow for elimination of the pilot hole when shallow gas is expected. However, simulations have shown that the system can detect an influx prior to gas reaching the return line, and also handle the influx in a safe manner. This verifies the feasibility of the RMR system related to safety and well control. </p...|$|E
