5|$|In 1857, Deady {{was elected}} as a {{delegate}} to the Oregon Constitutional Convention. The convention {{was held in the}} territorial capital of Salem to prepare the territory for statehood. He became president of the body and was influential in shaping the new state constitution, which outlawed slavery but excluded African-Americans from settling in the new state. Deady successfully advocated for provisions in the document to set six-year terms for judges, four-year terms for state officers, and biennial sessions for the legislature. He also led the southern party, which opposed <b>state</b> <b>education</b> in all forms. During the debates Deady also advocated for discrimination towards Chinese immigrants and Blacks, as well as in favor for slavery in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, the Legislature placed all state-funded higher {{education}} {{into the new}} State University of New York (SUNY). Cornell's four statutory colleges (agriculture, human ecology, labor relations and veterinary medicine) have been affiliated with SUNY since its inception, but {{did not have any}} such state affiliation prior to that time. Statutory college employees legally are employees of Cornell, not employees of SUNY. The <b>State</b> <b>Education</b> Law gives the SUNY Board of Trustees the authority to approve Cornell's appointment of the deans/unit heads of the statutory colleges, and control of the level of state funding for the statutory colleges.|$|E
5|$|In January 1985, Collins renewed her {{push for}} {{additional}} education funding and changes by appointing herself {{secretary of the}} <b>state</b> <b>Education</b> and Humanities Cabinet. Following the announcement, Collins and several key legislators {{held a series of}} meetings in every county, advocating for her proposed changes and seeking information about what types of changes the state's citizens desired. At the meetings, Collins was careful to separate the issues of her proposed education plan and potential tax increases. She believed that opposition to increased taxes had prevented her previous package from being enacted.|$|E

The school gradually improved its academic scope and standing, and was registered with the <b>State</b> <b>Education</b> Department and accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1944. In 1951, the Board of Regents authorized the college to grant Associate of Arts and Associate of Applied Science degrees. The following year, the Army Map Service selected the college as the only one in the country for professional training in cartography.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 2011, several renovations took place, {{affecting}} primarily the high school. All front-facing windows of the high school were replaced with energy-efficient windows, and a permanent-storage building was constructed on the northeast side to store auditorium and maintenance supplies. In addition, many of the computers in the school were replaced with thin client computers. In 2013, the school's cardiovascular and weight lifting center was improved with more machines and equipment, increased space, new flat screen televisions, and other additions. In 2013 and 2014, the school's fields on the property were remediated due to the use of contaminated fill. The football field was completed with artificial turf, as well as the track and artificial turf baseball field; an artificial turf hockey field was to be completed by Labor Day. The lower soccer field will be reconstructed after the fall 2014 soccer season. Work on the softball field was finished in fall 2013. A security plan is to be submitted to the New York <b>State</b> <b>Education</b> Department; it includes plans to upgrade the main entrance doors and construct vestibules and greeter stations.|$|E
5|$|Bladin became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24November 1948; this {{position}} {{gave him a}} seat on the Air Board, which consisted of the RAAF's most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. He succeeded Joe Hewitt, and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated. RAAF Staff College was opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, providing an advanced defence course aimed at squadron leaders and wing commanders; various international facilities were also utilised to further officers' education. In October, Bladin became involved in the push for a Junior Equipment and Administrative Training Scheme to offer apprenticeships to clerical and supply staff, which was established two years later. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the King's Birthday Honours announced in June 1950. In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in <b>state</b> <b>education,</b> he sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their degree qualifications with formal teaching credentials. Over the following year, in response to increased demands for aircrew to meet Australia's commitments to the Malayan Emergency and the Korean War, pilot training was broken out from a single all-encompassing course at No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS) in Point Cook, Victoria, into separate courses at the newly formed No.1 Initial Flying Training School at Archerfield, Queensland, No.1 Basic Flying Training School at Uranquinty, New South Wales, and No.1 Applied Flying Training School (re-formed from No.1 FTS) at Point Cook.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 1, {{hurricane}} warnings were issued for the northwest Bahamas while hurricane watches were issued for the lower east coast of Florida and tropical storm watches were issued for the Florida Keys. There was the potential for catastrophic damage along Florida's heavily populated east coast, with warnings that damages from Frances could exceed the insured losses of Hurricane Andrew. These damage estimates were in anticipation that Frances would strike Florida as a strong Category Four hurricane. Preparations for the storm were stepped up in Florida on September 1. Governor Jeb Bush {{declared a state of}} emergency, Kennedy Space Center closed down, and evacuations of 500,000people were initially ordered. Eventually 41 counties received evacuation orders, covering 2.8million residents, the largest evacuation in Florida's history. The <b>state</b> <b>education</b> system also responded to the pending crisis. Many universities across Florida canceled classes. Both the University of Central Florida and the University of North Florida told all students to leave their dorms. Evacuation at the University of South Florida was performed on a dorm-by-dorm basis. Florida Atlantic University was closed for a week and a half. Most schools were shut down from southern Miami-Dade County to just south of Melbourne two days before the hurricane. The annual Florida State University-University of Miami college football game was rescheduled for the following week.|$|E
5|$|The first {{institute}} {{for higher education}} in the village was the School of Practical Agriculture and Horticulture, which Walter Law helped establish on his Briarcliff Farms in 1900. The school taught students ages 16 to 35 in crop and livestock care. In 1902, the school moved to a larger location near Poughkeepsie and closed a year later {{due to a lack of}} funding. In addition, Briarcliff Manor has been the location for several colleges. Briarcliff Junior College was founded in 1903 at the Briarcliff Lodge, and moved near Briarcliff Congregational Church, on land Walter Law donated, in 1905. Among its trustees were Howard Deering Johnson, Norman Cousins, Carl Carmer, Thomas K. Finletter, William Zorach, Eduard C. Lindeman, and Lyman Bryson. Ordway Tead was chairman of the board of trustees, and his wife Clara was the college's first president. The school gradually improved its academic scope and standing, and was registered with the <b>State</b> <b>Education</b> Department and accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1944. In 1951, the Board of Regents authorized the college to grant Associate of Arts and Associate of Applied Science degrees. The following year, the Army Map Service selected the college as the only one in the country for professional training in cartography. In 1956, the junior college started issuing bachelor's degrees, and became known as Briarcliff College. In 1977 Pace University bought Briarcliff College and the Spanish Renaissance-style Briarcliff Grade School building, incorporating them into its Pleasantville campus. The Briarcliff Grade School building, which housed the village public school from 1909 to 1980, became known as the Pace University Village Center. During Pace's occupation, the building housed the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society and the Village Youth Center. Pace University operated the school building until its demolition in 1996, and the Briarcliff College campus until 2015. At the Briarcliff Lodge property, the Edgewood Park School operated from 1936 to 1954, and King's College subsequently operated there from 1955 to 1994, also using the lodge building and other dormitories and academic buildings.|$|E
