The candidate conformal coatings evaluated in this study included silicone elastomers, epoxies, and Parylenes with bi-layer or tri-layer designs.

Pary-lene F displayed excellent properties for environmental protection. Silicone elastomers displayed less resistance to the harsh environ-ment as compared to the Parylene family (N, C, D types), but it could provide advantages for low residual stress applications. The change in adhesion strength between Parylene C and silicone elas-tomers after exposure to thermal shock cycling or 85 C/ 85 %RH aging for different time periods were conducted from die shear test in terms of the interfacial failure. SIR values of all the candidate materials after 1000 h exposure to 85 C/ 85 %RH, with 100 V dc for resistance measurement, range from 1 108 – 1 109. Leakage current values after 1000 h exposure to 85 C/ 85 %RH, 175 V bias, are in the range of 10 9 to 10 11 Amp.

Performance {{studies were carried out}} by total immersion in deionized water at 60 °C for 10 days followed by microscopic investigations and potentiostatic studies on coated SIR patterns at 12 V potential bias and by measuring the resulting leakage current. Foe both plain laminates and SIR patterns, detailed investigation of the corrosion morphology was carried out. The amount of water intake by the coating was calculated by the weight-gain method. The amount of no-clean flux residue resulting at various temperatures was quantified using ion chromatography by extracting the residue, and sur-face morphology of the residues was investigated using optical microscopy. The flux residue in general consists of both resin and activator components such as carboxylic acids. Coated samples with flux residues after exposure showed blisters all over the surface and reduction in adhesion strength.

Conformal coatings are widely used on circuit board assemblies as an attempt to improve reliability and to ensure high insulation impedances, which are for example demanded by low current consumption battery operated RF circuitry. However, components, such as small ceramic capacitors, have occasionally been found to fail in some applications, particularly when covered with a thick silicone conformal coating. This is thought to be due to the diffusion of water through the coating to the capacitor surface where it then combines with solder flux residue, or other organic or ionic contamination left on the components, thereby dramatically increasing the effective component leakage current. The primary objective of this experimental research is therefore to establish a clear understanding of the effects of moisture exposure on the <b>surface</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> (SIR) of conformally coated printed circuit board (PCB) assemblies.

This paper first studied the ECM of the soldered joints under distilled water after removing the fluxes. In addition, conditions under high temperature and high humidity were also set up to investigate the changes of the initial <b>surface</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> (SIR) with the residues of no clean fluxes. It is found under distilled water that dendrites of the solder joints take on different morphologies with the different migration elements. For the joints of Sn- 37 Pb and Sn- 36 Pb- 2 Ag solders, the main migration element is Pb. While that of Sn- 3. 5 Ag and Sn- 4 Ag- 0. 5 Cu solders, it is Cu that usually migrates and forms dendrites due to the poor wettability of the solder paste leads to part exposure of Cu substrate at the wetting brim. For Sn- 3 Ag- 0. 5 Cu solder joints, Sn leads the migration. While for Sn-Zn-Bi solder joints, it is always Zn to migrate which means Zn is more mobile than Cu. The investigation on SIR shows the fluxes have great effect on the migration behavior. The failure time of the joints with the same solder alloy compositions have different failure time due to the different fluxes.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the global {{electronics}} manufacture environment has brought about the onset {{of a variety of}} new, untested materials and processing chemicals. The interactions between substrates and processing chemicals that can occur during manufacture, storage and use must be assessed in order to determine long-term reliability. <b>Surface</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> (SIR) testing is a standard industry technique used to assess the interactions between processing chemicals (e. g., soldering fluxes) and substrates. SIR test method conditions vary in terms of the temperature and the humidity used to accelerate the normal failure modes. Typically, a 45 to 50 volt bias is applied to an interdigitated comb pattern, and periodic SIR measurements are made using a 100 volt test. Pass/fail criteria based solely on SIR electrical values, (e. g., 100 MΩ) however are inadequate. Often the electrical measurement fails to reveal the presence of surface dendrites due to contaminants related to processing chemicals. This failure occurs because the dendrite burns out between electrical readings when the circuit continues to be biased at 50 volts. A new “linear test circuit ” has been developed to overcome this deficiency. The circuit uses an operational amplifier to detect the formation of a surface dendrite between electrodes on the comb pattern. When the dendrite shorts the circuit, voltage to the comb pattern is removed. Thus, the presence of the dendrite is captured electrically, and the dendrite is preserved for further analysis. This paper will present the circuit used and data showing its ’ effectiveness at detecting both surface dendrites and subsurface conductive anodic filament formation...|$|E

The key strategy is to find process parameters that make the process insensitive to noise factors. Traditional optimization approaches focus on maximizing the response variable while the Robust approach focuses on consistent results regardless of variation in noise factors. The Robust method was utilized {{in the development of}} a lead free process for manufacturing an Automotive SMT product. Major factors that can create variation in a lead free process were identified, including lead free solder paste brand, paste print speed, oven reflow temperatures and times, and reflow environment. Several noise factors were studied including volume of solder paste, location of components on the board, and lead frame plating materials, namely tin and palladium/nickel/gold. A series of measurements were made on the lead free product that assessed the strength and reliability of lead free solder joints, measurements such as visual scoring, cross-section, <b>surface</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance,</b> and pull strength. Using the Robust experimental design, these measurements were optimized to create high quality and reliable lead free SMT solder joints that were the most insensitive to the noise. In essence, quality was increased by using variable measurements rather than by counting attributes (good/bad). Overall, a gain of 2. 1 dB was realized. In Robust terms, this equates to reducing variation in the lead free process by ~ 22 %. This study also revealed which of the processing factors were most significant in controlling the lead free process.

40|$|Electrochemical {{migration}} (ECM) is {{the growth}} of conductive metal filaments on {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) through an electrolyte solution under a DC voltage bias. ECM can cause a reduction in <b>surface</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> (SIR) between adjacent conductors and lead to intermittent or catastrophic circuit failures. To evaluate the current leakage and electrochemical migration behavior on printed circuit boards, IPC B- 24 comb structures were exposed to 65 °C and 88 % relative humidity conditions under direct-current (DC) bias for over 1000 hours {{to determine the effects of}} some key factors to ECM. The key factors include: solder alloy (eutectic tin-lead and lead-free), board finish (organic solderability preservative versus lead-free hot air solder leveling), spacing (25 mil versus 12. 5 mil), and voltage (40 V versus 5 V bias), solder mask (using and not using), flux solids content. In-situ measurements of SIR, energy-dispersive spectroscopy after testing and optical inspection before and after test were used. The relationships between the electrical behavior and electrochemical behavior of solder alloys were established. The long term electrochemical behaviors of tin-lead and lead-free solders were obtained. The morphology and distribution of migrated species, including Sn, Pb, Cu and Ag were investigated. Compared with solder alloy, board finishes played a secondary role in affecting SIR due to their complexation with or dissolution into the solder. The competing effect between electric field and spacing was also investigated. Solder mask was found to stabilize SIR and reduce the chances for ECM to occur due to its "walling effect". Compared to low solids flux, medium solids flux increased the characteristic lives of PCBs due to their encapsulation effects. The prolonged SIR decline of Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu soldered boards was simulated by three-dimensional progressive and instantaneous nucleation models, whose predictions were compared with experimental data.
