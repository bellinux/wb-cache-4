2500|$|The Anisminic {{principle}} {{applies only}} to public bodies exercising executive functions, over which the courts can exercise their supervisory role and {{have the power to}} decide questions of law. However, superior courts do not have any <b>supervisory</b> <b>function</b> in relation to inferior courts of law, because Parliament is deemed to have intended that such courts are to be final arbiters of questions of law. Whether the decision of a court of law is final and not subject to judicial review depends on a construction of the statute defining the jurisdiction and powers of the court. In Re Racal Communications Ltd. (1980), Lord Diplock noted that if a statute provides that the court's decision should be final and conclusive, the [...] "subtle distinctions formerly drawn between errors of law which go to jurisdiction and errors of law which do not" [...] survive. Hence, any non-jurisdictional errors of law made by a court can be only corrected by appeal if the statute provides for it.|$|E
2500|$|Total ouster clauses, {{also known}} as {{finality}} clauses, seek to completely exclude the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts. In the United Kingdom, before the seminal decision of Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission (1968), the law drew a distinction between situations where the public body was acting within the powers conferred on it by law but committed an error of law (a [...] "non-jurisdictional error of law"), and situations where the commission of the error of law meant that the public body did not in fact have power to act (a [...] "jurisdictional error of law"). In the former situation, a total ouster clause precluded the courts from exercising their <b>supervisory</b> <b>function</b> and issuing any prerogative orders to quash the erroneous action. The courts could only step in if the error of law affected {{the jurisdiction of the}} public body to act, for example, if the public body erroneously interpreted the scope of the powers conferred upon it, and thus made a decision which it had no power to make.|$|E

50|$|FSLRC {{proposes a}} unified {{consumer}} protection law which would contain three components: an enumerated set {{of rights and}} protections for consumers, an enumerated set of powers, and principles that guide what power should be used under what circumstances. The details of consumer protection would, of course, lie in the subordinated legislation that financial regulators would draft. As an example, whether or not loads and other conflicted remuneration structures should be banned {{is a question that}} would be addressed by the regulator. The proposed law will clearly pose this question to the regulator. The regulators would then utilise the powers provided to pursue the goals specified in the law, through subordinated legislation which would evolve over the years reflecting financial innovation, technological change, and the changing nature of the Indian economy. Alongside this rule-making mandate, there would be a <b>supervisory</b> <b>function</b> to ensure compliance with these rules.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The world {{all over}} {{is of the}} opinion that quality and {{functional}} education are pre-requisite for the attainment of a country’s development economically and technologically. Monumental studies and achieve- ments in various spheres of life by developed and developing Nations of the world are often attributed to products of high standards of education.

For such educational system to stand tall in attaining these goals, re-invigorated or repositioned administrative and <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions</b> in all our educational systems in general and vocational technical education in particular must be put in place. e-activity with all of its components have the potentials of bringing these experiences to bare in vocational technical education.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether principals, department chairpersons, and teachers felt the <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions</b> generally associated with the department chairperson’s role, should be considered more important than what they were considered to be at the time of the investigation. [...] The study was a cross-sectional description of the perceptions held by a random sample of secondary school teachers and the entire population of secondary school department chairpersons and their principals. Two hundred and twenty-two teachers, two hundred and twenty-two department chairpersons, and sixty-five principals were sent a questionnaire. The instrument, developed for this study, measured each reference group’s perception of the amount of importance presently placed on the 15 <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions,</b> and their perception as to the amount of importance which each group felt should be placed on the 15 functions. The statistical procedure used to test the hypotheses was the t-test. [...] The major finding of this study was that principals, department chairpersons and teachers all felt that more importance should be placed on each of the <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions</b> examined. Functions which each of the three reference groups felt should be considered important functions of the department chairperson’s role included: improving student evaluation procedures, evaluating and changing the department's instructional program, developing the department’s goals and objectives, orienting new teachers, coordinating the work of department teachers, assessing the need for teacher inservice, and keeping department members informed. [...] The <b>supervisory</b> <b>functions</b> of coordinating the use of resource people, reporting department activities, orienting substitutes, conducting demonstration teaching, and coordinating the department's program with other school departments, were considered, by all three reference groups, to be somewhat important functions of the department chairperson's role. Informally observing teachers was a function which all three reference groups felt should be considered more important, but principals, department chairpersons and teachers were reluctant to suggest that this function should even be considered a somewhat important function of the department chairperson’s role. [...] The major finding suggests the need for school boards and school administrators to examine the functions presently performed by department chairpersons, and to then define or redefine the minimum parameters of the department chairperson position. School boards and school administrators should also structure the department chairperson position in such a way that department chairpersons are given the authority and time needed to perform these functions. The development of an on-going evaluation procedure for the department chairperson position would better ensure effective use of this position...|$|R
