5000|$|Only one non-developing {{depression}} formed {{during the}} month of August, an unusually eastward forming system. The depression was first identified just offshore eastern Africa on September 8, near where Tropical Storm Christine formed later in the month. Tracking rapidly towards the west, the depression dissipated on September 11 over open waters. In addition to the two notable tropical depressions and two named storms in September, a <b>slow-moving</b> <b>depression</b> formed south-southeast of Bermuda on September 8. Tracking generally northward, the depression dissipated early on September 10 without affecting land. Upon the declaration of Hurricane Fran on October 10, a new depression formed southwest of the strengthening hurricane. This system rapidly tracked northeast and dissipated two days later. Later that month, a <b>slow-moving</b> <b>depression</b> formed near the Azores. This system tracked southeast and dissipated on October 30 without affecting land. The final system of the year formed near the northern coast of Panama on November 17. The depression was noted as a [...] "...strong depression..." [...] by the National Hurricane Center and may have briefly attained tropical storm intensity before making landfall in northern Costa Rica on November 18; the system dissipated later that day over land.|$|E
50|$|The {{third of}} four major {{depressions}} {{for the month}} arrived in western Victoria on the 17th and produced very heavy falls upon already-saturated catchments on flat land where water was not draining away quickly. As the <b>slow-moving</b> <b>depression</b> linked with warm air from the Tasman Sea, thunderstorms began to develop over the Wimmera region on the 18th. Rich Avon recorded 50mm (2 inches) from one of these whilst in the Great Divide {{there were reports that}} some areas had received as much as 100mm (4 inches) in as little as six hours.|$|E
40|$|On 3 August 1829, {{north-east}} Scotland recorded one of {{the most}} severe catastrophic floods in modern UK history. Sir Thomas Dick Lauder's An account of the great floods of August 1829 in the province of Moray and adjoining districts (1830) provides a detailed eyewitness account {{that can be used to}} reconstruct the flood. This paper reconstructs the hydrometeorology of the flood, assesses its geomorphological and societal impacts and provides a context for assessing present-day flood risk management. The flood was generated by a <b>slow-moving</b> <b>depression</b> in the Moray Firth, which produced an unstable northerly airflow over the NE Grampian Mountains and a minimum 24 hour rainfall of 95 mm. The River Findhorn, {{one of the}} most severely affected drainage basins, was subject to detailed analysis by Lauder, including the reporting of numerous flood levels on bridges and within bedrock gorges. Reconstruction of flood flows at five of these sites using Manning's equation and moving successively downstream yields peak flows of 711 m 3 /s (drainage area 322. 2 km 2), 1042 m 3 /s (515. 4 km 2), 1262 m 3 /s (568. 1 km 2) and 1484 m 3 /s (599. 6 km 2) on the main stem of the Findhorn, with 451 m 3 /s (171. 9 km 2) on a major tributary. Each peak flow based on a Manning's n of 0. 04 – 0. 08 represents the optimal value within limits which vary between − 25 % to + 33 % and all lie just within the upper boundary when plotted in relation to the envelope curve for catastrophic floods within the UK. Lauder also provides a detailed account of the geomorphic impacts of the flood in the Findhorn valley. Bedrock reaches and ‘mixed’ alluvial/bedrock-controlled reaches proved to be robust and registered minimal change, but alluvial reaches reported widespread bank erosion and slope failures with extensive sheets of sand and gravel deposited downstream on valuable agricultural land. Meander cut-offs occurred and many new channels were excavated, especially in the coastal lowlands where the present-day channel broadly follows that excavated in 1829, attesting to the longevity of the flood's impacts. The immediate societal impact included eight fatalities, destitution for at least 289 families, large-scale destruction of roads and bridges, losses for estate owners approaching £ 2. 83 million (2005 prices) and a major shock to a relatively prosperous rural economy. Human response and mitigation took the form of fatalistic acceptance, bearing the loss and dependence on local charitable relief. The reconstruction of the 1829 ‘Muckle Spate’ has a significance far beyond its immediate setting in terms of hydrology (confirming the shape of the envelope curve for Britain's most extreme floods), geomorphology (reporting significant and long-lasting imprints on the riverscape, and confirming the primacy of water-based erosion early in the nineteenth century) and societal impact (contrasting individual bearing of loss mitigated by charitable relief with the present-day reliance on flood protection largely provided by the state). The reconstruction also demonstrates the value of reliable historical sources in placing recent catastrophic floods within their longer-term context...|$|E
50|$|With these moist conditions, it {{was natural}} that heavy rain in August would cause major {{flooding}} on the State's rivers, {{and a series of}} very <b>slow-moving</b> <b>depressions</b> naturally caused August to be very wet. As early as 11 August major flooding on the Richardson River at Donald was anticipated.|$|R
50|$|Gales {{from between}} north-north-east and {{east-north-east}} {{are the most}} important gales of the east coast of Spain. They are known locally as llevantades (in Catalan) and are an intense form of the llevant or levanter, i.e., north-easterly winds of long fetch, as opposed to diurnal coastal breezes. These gales are most frequent and dangerous in spring and autumn (February to May and October to December), and are generally associated with <b>slow-moving</b> <b>depressions</b> crossing the Mediterranean between France and Algeria.|$|R
50|$|The worst river {{flooding}} in Radford's recorded history occurred on August 14, 1940 with a <b>slow-moving</b> tropical <b>depression.</b> The 1940 hurricane season produced eight storms, four {{of which were}} hurricanes. Around August 5 of that year, a tropical storm was detected along the northern Leeward Islands in the West Indies. The storm brought wind gusts of 44 mph to San Juan, Puerto Rico as it moved northwestward. By August 6 it began a turn to the north while producing rough seas in the southeastern Bahamas. Four days later on August 10 the S.S. Maine off the southeast coast measured hurricane-force winds and the storm began movement again toward the northwest. The storm made landfall as a category 1 hurricane on August 11 at approximately 4 PM near Beaufort, South Carolina (along the SC/GA border). Winds reached 73 mph in nearby Savannah, Georgia.|$|R

Winds reached 73 mph in nearby Savannah, Georgia.As the Georgia-South Carolina hurricane of 1940 moved inland, record rainfall amounts were observed from South Carolina north through the Smoky Mountains and into southwest and central Virginia. The storm meandered along the Cumberland Plateau region as rain began falling in Virginia on August 13. The mountainous terrain coupled with extremely slow movement from the now tropical depression produced copious amounts of rain. Copper Hill in Floyd County, Virginia received the highest rainfall in the state: 17.03”.|$|R
50|$|A <b>slow-moving</b> system, the <b>depression</b> {{steadily}} {{organized as}} it approached the Lesser Antilles. Observations from aircraft reconnaissance {{indicated that the}} system attained gale-force winds by 12:00 UTC on September 7, resulting in its upgrade to a tropical storm. It was also assigned the name Beulah, making it the second named storm of the 1967 season. Shortly after being named, Beulah clipped the southern coast of Martinique and entered the eastern Caribbean Sea. Feeding off the warm waters of the Caribbean, the cyclone quickly strengthened and reached hurricane intensity by 18:00 UTC on September 8. Rapid deepening ensued thereafter with the storm's central pressure falling to 940 mbar (hPa; 27.75 inHg) the following day as it passed 100 mi (160 km) south of Puerto Rico. At this time winds were estimated {{to be at least}} 140 mph (225 km/h), ranking Beulah as a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. Upon reaching this strength, weather radar imagery from San Juan, Puerto Rico showed that Beulah featured a 15 mi (24 km) wide eye surrounded by an intense eyewall about 8 mi (13 km) thick.|$|R
40|$|Climate change {{affects the}} {{fundamental}} bases of good human health, which are clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food, and secure shelter. Climate change {{is known to}} impact health through three climate dimensions: extreme heat, natural disasters, and infections and diseases. The temporal and spatial climatic changes that will affect the biology and ecology of vectors and intermediate hosts are likely to increase the risks of disease transmission. The greatest effect of climate change on disease transmission {{is likely to be}} observed at the extremes of the range of temperatures at which transmission typically occurs. Caribbean countries are marked by unique geographical and geological features. When combined with their physical, infrastructural development, these features make them relatively more prone to negative impacts from changes in climatic conditions. The increased variability of climate associated with <b>slow-moving</b> tropical <b>depressions</b> has implications for water quality through flooding as well as hurricanes. Caribbean countries often have problems with water and sanitation. These problems are exacerbated whenever there is excess rainfall, or no rainfall. The current report aims to prepare the Caribbean to respond better to the anticipated impact of climate change on the health sector, while fostering a subregional Caribbean approach to reducing carbon emissions by 2050. It provides a major advance on the analytical and contextual issues surrounding the impact of climate change on health in the Caribbean by focusing on the vector-borne and waterborne diseases that are anticipated to be impacted directly by climate change. The ultimate goal is to quantify both the direct and indirect costs associated with each disease, and to present adaptation strategies that can address these health concerns effectively to benefit the populations of the Caribbean [...] I.
