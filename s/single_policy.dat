The composition of the coalition was heterogeneous, combining parties of communist ideology, the Party of Italian Communists and Communist Refoundation Party, within the same government as parties of Catholic inspiration, Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy and UDEUR Populars. The latter was led by Clemente Mastella, former chairman of Christian Democracy.

25|$|Any {{risk that}} can be {{quantified}} can potentially be insured. Specific kinds of risk that may give rise to claims are known as perils. An insurance policy will set out in detail which perils are covered by the policy and which are not. Below are non-exhaustive lists of the {{many different types of}} insurance that exist. A <b>single</b> <b>policy</b> that may cover risks in {{one or more of the}} categories set out below. For example, vehicle insurance would typically cover both the property risk (theft or damage to the vehicle) and the liability risk (legal claims arising from an accident). A home insurance policy in the United States typically includes coverage for damage to the home and the owner's belongings, certain legal claims against the owner, and even a small amount of coverage for medical expenses of guests who are injured on the owner's property.|$|E

Under this decision making regime, some or all policy impacts can be assigned thresholds which are used to eliminate {{at least some of}} the policy alternatives. In their example, one criterion [...] "is to minimize SO2 emissions" [...] and so a threshold might be a reduction SO2 emissions [...] "of at least 8.0 million tons per year". As such, any policy alternative that does not meet this threshold can be removed from consideration. If only a <b>single</b> <b>policy</b> alternative satisfies all the impact thresholds then it is the one that is considered a [...] "go" [...] for each impact. Otherwise it might be that all but a few policy alternatives are eliminated and those that remain need to be more closely examined in terms of their trade-offs so that a decision can be made.|$|E

40|$|EMU has {{a unique}} {{macroeconomic}} framework that combines a <b>single</b> monetary <b>policy</b> with coordinated national economic and fiscal policies. Since the coordination process has some serious weaknesses despite having been modified several times in recent years, {{the idea of a}} <b>single</b> economic/fiscal <b>policy</b> is being discussed as a potential alternative solution for the euro area. On the one hand, there are reasonable economic arguments in favor of a <b>single</b> fiscal <b>policy,</b> such as the need to formulate an aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area as a whole, the need to ensure sustainable macroeconomic stabilization within EMU, and the need for a kind of insurance against asymmetric shocks. On the other hand, establishing the context for a <b>single</b> fiscal <b>policy</b> would require significant changes to the present political, institutional, and macroeconomic design of the EU. Such a context could include full political union with a federal structure, and federal institutions, including an economic government or central fiscal authority for the euro area, with a much larger and restructured general budget at the EU level, and possible abandonment of the rule that the budget must be in balance every year. Currently, neither the political will nor the social support exists in the EU for transferring further national authority to a supranational, European level. Therefore, while it may be desirable, a <b>single</b> fiscal <b>policy</b> in the euro area can only be considered for the long run; it is not an option for the short or medium term.

However, with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, effective by 2014, all insurers {{will be fully}} prohibited from discriminating against or charging higher rates for any individuals based on pre-existing medical conditions. For individuals who pass individual medical plan underwriting where it is used, the average premiums they pay are lower than the average paid for employer-sponsored coverage (this comparison {{is based on the}} entire premium for employer-sponsored coverage, including both the employee and employer contributions). [...] Factors that may be contributing to this include: differences in age; less generous coverage in the individual market (higher beneficiary cost sharing); and a tendency for individual consumers to only buy benefits that they expect to need and use while group coverage may provide some benefits that most beneficiaries do not use. [...] Individual policyholders {{are also more likely to}} report being in excellent health than are people covered by employer-sponsored health insurance, which may be a contributing factor. Premiums in the individual market rose less rapidly over the period 2002 through 2005 than did out-of-pocket premiums in the employer-sponsored market (17.8% versus 34.4%). The increase was larger for family <b>policies</b> than for <b>single</b> <b>policies</b> (25.3% for family policies; the increase for <b>single</b> <b>policies</b> was not statistically significant).

In this case it is comparable in performance to the more complex dual index heuristic, which has been shown in the literature to perform within a few percent of the optimal solution. Moreover, we demonstrate when dual sourcing can achieve significant savings compared to single sourcing, and establish that for our model single sourcing with the expedited supplier is never optimal. 1...|$|R
