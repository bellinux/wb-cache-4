Its primary goal is to find new exoplanets transiting bright stars, 4 < m_V < 8, by monitoring the full sky. MASCARA consists of one northern station on La Palma, Canary Islands (fully operational since February 2015), one southern station at La Silla Observatory, Chile (operational from early 2017), and a data centre at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands. Both MASCARA stations are equipped with five interline CCD cameras using wide field lenses (24 mm focal length) with fixed pointings, which together provide coverage down to airmass 3 of the local sky. The interline CCD cameras allow for back-to-back exposures, taken at fixed <b>sidereal</b> <b>times</b> with exposure times of 6. 4 sidereal seconds. The exposures are short enough that the motion of stars across the CCD does not exceed one pixel during an integration. Astrometry and photometry are performed on-site, after which the resulting light curves are transferred to Leiden for further analysis. The final MASCARA archive will contain light curves for ∼ 70, 000 stars down to m_V= 8. 4, with a precision of 1. 5 % per 5 minutes at m_V= 8.

2500|$|The first radio antenna [...] used to {{identify}} an astronomical radio source was one built by Karl Guthe Jansky, an engineer with Bell Telephone Laboratories, in [...] 1932. Jansky was assigned the job of identifying sources of static that might interfere with radio telephone service. Jansky's antenna was an array of dipoles and reflectors designed to receive short wave radio signals at a frequency of 20.5 MHz (wavelength about 14.6 meters). It was mounted on a turntable that allowed it to rotate in any direction, earning it the name [...] "Jansky's merry-go-round". [...] It had a diameter of approximately [...] and stood [...] tall. By rotating the antenna, {{the direction of the}} received interfering radio source (static) could be pinpointed. A small shed {{to the side of the}} antenna housed an analog pen-and-paper recording system. After recording signals from all directions for several months, Jansky eventually categorized them into three types of static: nearby thunderstorms, distant thunderstorms, and a faint steady hiss of unknown origin. Jansky finally determined that the [...] "faint hiss" [...] repeated on a cycle of 23 hours and 56 minutes. This period is the length of an astronomical <b>sidereal</b> day, the <b>time</b> it takes any [...] "fixed" [...] object located on the celestial sphere to come back to the same location in the sky.

Certain CPT observables can depend on the meson momentum and exhibit <b>sidereal</b> variations in <b>time.</b> Any leading-order CPT violation would be controlled by four parameters that can be separately constrained in appropriate experiments. Recent experiments bound certain combinations of these parameters at the level of about 10 − 20 GeV. Experiments using neutral-meson oscillations can place constraints of remarkable precision on possible violations of CPT invariance. For kaons, recent results [1, 2, 3] bound the CPT figure of merit rK ≡ |mK −m K |/mK to less than a part in 10 18. Other experiments [4, 5, 6] are expected to improve this bound in the near future. Experiments with neutral-B mesons [7, 8] have also placed high-precision constraints on possible CPT violation, and the B and charm factories should produce additional bounds on the heavy neutral-meson systems. A purely phenomenological treatment of possible CPT violation in the kaon system has been known for some time [9]. In this approach, a complex phenomenological parameter δK allowing for indirect CPT violation is introduced in the standard relationships between the physical meson states and the strong-interaction eigenstates. No information about δK itself can be obtained within this framework. However, over the past ten years a plausible theoretical framework allowing the possibility of CPT violation has been developed. It involves the notion of spontaneous breaking of CPT and Lorentz symmetry in a fundamental theory [10], perhaps arising at the Planck scale from effects in a quantum theory of gravity or string theory...|$|R

For the first time, this was made using tomography maps of the coronal structure thus is far superior to previous studies based on autocorrelations of the coronal brightness.

Solar rotational tomography is applied to Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) C 2 /Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) observations covering the period 1996 - 2010, resulting in a set of electron density maps at a height of 4 R sun from which rotation rates can be calculated. Large variation of rotation rates is measured. Rates are dominated by the Carrington rotation rate (14. 18 deg d- 1 <b>sidereal),</b> but at <b>times</b> over the solar cycle, rates are measured between - 3 and 3 deg d- 1 relative to the Carrington rotation rate. Rotation rates can vary considerably between latitudes, even between neighboring latitudes. They can remain relatively stable or change smoothly over long periods of times, or can change rather abruptly. There are periods for certain latitudes (for example, the equator at solar maximum) when the movement is dominated by rapid structural reconfiguration, not a coherent rotation. These results raise new questions regarding the link between the Sun and the corona, and provide fresh challenges to interpretations of the coronal structural evolution and the development of large-scale coronal models. In particular, can interchange reconnection provide an explanation of the considerable latitudinal differences in rotation rates, and what mechanism can explain abrupt changes in rotation rates?publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
