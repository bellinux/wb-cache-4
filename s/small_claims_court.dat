50|$|<b>Small</b> <b>claim</b> <b>courts</b> in Brazil were {{established}} by Law No. 9,099/1995 and Article One of such law states that they shall be organized by both Federal Judiciary and State Judiciary. Therefore, there are Federal <b>Small</b> <b>Claim</b> <b>Courts</b> (single noun Juizado Especial Federal), {{as well as}} <b>Small</b> <b>Claim</b> <b>Courts</b> {{that are part of}} a state's judiciary structure. The <b>Small</b> <b>Claim</b> <b>Courts</b> that belong to a State's Judiciary are subdivided into two types of courts: the Special Civil Court (Juizado Especial Cívil, shortened as JEC) and the Special Criminal Court (Juizado Especial Criminal, shortened as Jecrim). Under Article Three of Law No. 9,099/1995, Civil Claims involving an amount up to 40 (forty) monthly minimal wages or R$24,880.00 (October 2012), which correspond to roughly US$12,440.00, may be filed before a Special Civil Court, as well as <b>small</b> <b>claims</b> involving landlords and some claims set by Article 275, II, of the Code of Civil Procedure. Special Criminal Courts, on the other hand, may process <b>claims</b> involving <b>small</b> criminal offenses, which, under Article 60 of Law No. 9,099/1995 are those either set by the Contraventions Law (Decree No. 3,688/1941) or those where the penalty does not surpass 02 (two years). As per Article 54, there are no court fees for the <b>Small</b> <b>Claim</b> <b>Courts.</b> However, if an appeal is filed, court fees shall be applied.|$|R

This paper focuses on these alternative forms of justice, regarding domestic violence. Using ethnographic studies of Women's Police Stations and at <b>Small</b> <b>Claim</b> <b>Courts,</b> we argue that conciliation can be very different in these two institutions of the judicial system. The contrasts between moral values and the symbols used in different forms by these two institutions offer elements that can further be our understanding of the context in which Maria da Penha Law was created on August 17 th of 2006.

Kapitan Yap Ah Loy bought a sprawling piece of real estate to set up a brick industry for the rebuilding of Kuala Lumpur; this place is the eponymous Brickfields. Destroyed atap buildings were replaced with brick and tiled ones, and many of the new brick buildings are characterised by the [...] "five foot ways" [...] as well as Chinese carpentry work. This resulted in a distinct eclectic shop house architecture typical to this region. [...] Kapitan Yap Ah Loy expanded road access in the city significantly, linking up tin mines with the city; these roads include the main arterial routes of the present Ampang Road, Pudu Road and Petaling Street. As Chinese Kapitan, he was vested with wide powers on a par with Malay community leaders. [...] Law reforms were implemented and new legal measures introduced to the assembly.

40|$|There are {{significant}} difficulties in providing consumers with redress because dispute resolution costs are high {{relative to the}} sums being sought. Consumers also manifest a reluctance to enter legal processes for other reasons. This prompted the creation of user-friendly <b>small</b> <b>claims</b> <b>courts</b> and encouraged the discussion and sometimes the use of non-judicial, alternative dispute resolution forums for addressing consumer redress. This paper explores the theoretical and practical distinction between {{these two types of}} dispute resolution forums. The practical differences are examined on the basis of observation of both types of forums and discussions with practitioners of alternative dispute resolution. The paper concludes that while there {{are significant}} theoretical differences between the two forums, few of these are inherent. In fact, there is evidence that <b>small</b> <b>claims</b> <b>courts</b> have begun to adopt a number of alternative dispute resolution techniques and could adopt more. Nonetheless, some alternative dispute resolution techniques which are not susceptible to adoption by courts are, based on evidence generated through field research for this paper, clearly more efficient for resolving particular types of disputes than analagous techniques used in courts. It is probable as well, though the evidence collected in field observation is not conclusive, that some types of disputes are better resolved by <b>small</b> <b>claims</b> <b>courts.</b> A more effective consumer redress system might be achieved if the forum and techniques were more appropriately fitted to the particular fuss. The paper offers guidance on how this might be achieved, and the benefits and costs to governments, business and consumers associated with obtaining more effective consumer redress...|$|R
