25|$|Polyelectrolytes are {{polymers}} whose repeating units bear an electrolyte group. Polycations and polyanions are polyelectrolytes. These groups dissociate in aqueous solutions (water), {{making the}} polymers charged. Polyelectrolyte properties are thus similar to both electrolytes (salts) and polymers (high molecular weight compounds) and are sometimes called polysalts. Like salts, their solutions are electrically conductive. Like polymers, their solutions are often viscous. Charged molecular chains, commonly present in <b>soft</b> <b>matter</b> systems, play a fundamental {{role in determining}} structure, stability and the interactions of various molecular assemblies. Theoretical approaches to describing their statistical properties differ profoundly from those of their electrically neutral counterparts, while technological and industrial fields exploit their unique properties. Many biological molecules are polyelectrolytes. For instance, polypeptides, glycosaminoglycans, and DNA are polyelectrolytes. Both natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes are used in a variety of industries.|$|E
40|$|As all-atom {{molecular}} dynamics method {{is limited by}} its enormous computational cost, various coarse-grained strategies {{have been developed to}} extend the length scale of <b>soft</b> <b>matters</b> in the modeling of mechanical behaviors. However, the classical thermostat algorithm in highly coarse-grained {{molecular dynamics}} method would underestimate the thermodynamic behaviors of <b>soft</b> <b>matters</b> (e. g. microfilaments in cells), which can weaken the ability of materials to overcome local energy traps in granular modeling. Based on all-atom molecular dynamics modeling of microfilament fragments (G-actin clusters), a new stochastic thermostat algorithm is developed to retain the representation of thermodynamic properties of microfilaments at extra coarse-grained level. The accuracy of this stochastic thermostat algorithm is validated by all-atom MD simulation. This new stochastic thermostat algorithm provides an efficient way to investigate the thermomechanical properties of large-scale <b>soft</b> <b>matters...</b>|$|R

25|$|Placement of {{the sample}} stage {{into one of the}} {{interferometer}}'s arms (instead of outside of the interferometer as typically implemented in conventional FTIR) is a key element of nano-FTIR. It boosts the weak near-field signal due to interference with the strong reference field, helps to eliminate completely the background caused by parasitic scattering off everything that falls into large diffraction-limited beam focus, and most importantly, allows for recording of both amplitude s and phase φ spectra of the tip-scattered radiation. With the detection of phase, nano-FTIR provides complete information about near fields, which is essential for quantitative studies and many other applications. For example, for <b>soft</b> <b>matter</b> samples (organics, polymers, biomaterials, etc.), φ directly relates to the absorption in the sample material. This permits a direct comparison of nano-FTIR spectra with conventional absorption spectra {{of the sample}} material, thus allowing for simple spectroscopic identification according to standard FTIR databases.|$|E

2500|$|The {{availability}} of both amplitude and {{phase of the}} scattered field measured in nano-FTIR allows for the recovery of both real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, i.e. finding the index of refraction and the extinction coefficient of the sample.
