5|$|Mach-Zehnder interferometers {{are being}} used in {{integrated}} optical circuits, in which light interferes between two branches of a waveguide that are externally modulated to vary their relative phase. A slight tilt {{of one of the}} beam <b>splitters</b> will result in a path difference and a change in the interference pattern. Mach-Zehnder interferometers are the basis {{of a wide variety of}} devices, from RF modulators to sensors to optical switches.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match of}} the PPV show saw reDRagon (Kyle O'Reilly and Bobby Fish) {{defending}} the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero), Time <b>Splitters</b> (Alex Shelley and Kushida), and the Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson). Romero performed the Forever Clothesline (multiple corner clotheslines) and double clotheslines on his opponents. A series of dives {{out of the}} ring culminated in Kushida diving from the turnbuckles onto his opponents on the floor. Although Time <b>Splitters</b> followed with a neckbreaker-moonsault combination on Nick, the three-count for a pinfall was stopped at two. The Young Bucks started a Superkick Party (multiple superkicks) and continued with a Meltzer Driver (assisted Tombstone piledriver) on Koslov, but the pin was again broken up. ReDRagon took over with a backbreaker and diving knee drop on Shelley, a double arm DDT and wheelbarrow suplex on Matt, and a super falcon arrow by Fish on Nick. The first Chasing the Dragon kick/brainbuster combination attempt was countered by an inside cradle by Koslov for a two count, but the second Chasing the Dragon attempt succeeded; O'Reilly pinned Koslov to retain the title at 13 minutes and 1 second.|$|E
5000|$|The {{splitting}} {{performance is}} very efficient {{in comparison with}} the predrilled hole-making. As the spacing between hole is near to front and side, the number of holes required are quite many. With manual type <b>splitter</b> , the wedge type <b>splitter</b> requires 20~25cm space, while piston type <b>splitter</b> requires 40~50cm.Larger size wedge <b>splitter</b> requires large spacing as much as 50~70cm. Large size piston <b>splitter</b> requires 60~100cm spacing [...] Large size wedge <b>splitter</b> or piston <b>splitter</b> is mounted on a vehicle like excavator.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there are}} many gear positions, {{shifting}} through gears usually follows a regular pattern. For example, a series of upshifts might use [...] "move to <b>splitter</b> direct; move to <b>splitter</b> overdrive; move shift lever to No. 2 and move <b>splitter</b> to underdrive; move <b>splitter</b> to direct; move <b>splitter</b> to overdrive; move shift lever to No. 3 and move <b>splitter</b> to underdrive"; and so on. In older trucks using floor-mounted levers, a bigger problem is common gear shifts require the drivers to move their hands between shift levers in a single shift, and without synchromesh, shifts must be carefully timed or the transmission will not engage. For this reason, some <b>splitter</b> transmissions have an additional [...] "under under" [...] range, so when the <b>splitter</b> is already in [...] "under" [...] it can be quickly downshifted again, without the delay of a double shift.|$|R
40|$|A {{microstrip}} power <b>splitter</b> with band-pass responses {{is presented}} in this paper. The design is based on square open loop resonator topology. This filtered power <b>splitter</b> does not require quarter wavelength transformers and {{will result in a}} smaller size than a conventional Wilkinson power divider with integrated band-pass filter. It is a two-way equal power <b>splitter</b> with fifth order band-pass filter characteristics. The power <b>splitter</b> is designed to have Chebyshev band-pass response function. A theoretical analytical circuit model will be presented. From the theoretical model, a microstrip filtered power <b>splitter</b> will be designed and simulated. The proposed filtered power <b>splitter</b> is small in size and reduces circuit complexity. The power <b>splitter</b> is simulated and measured, and the results are presented...|$|R
5|$|Later in the month, Bullet Club {{took part}} in NJPW's North American tour, {{produced}} in collaboration with ROH. The Young Bucks, who entered the tour as both the IWGP Junior Heavyweight and ROH World Tag Team Champions, lost the latter title to reDRagon (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly) on May 17, ending their two-month reign in their first defense. Meanwhile, their seven-month reign as the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions ended on June 21 at Dominion 6.21, where they were defeated by the Time <b>Splitters</b> in their sixth defense. Later that same event, Bad Luck Fale defeated Shinsuke Nakamura to become the new IWGP Intercontinental Champion. On June 29, Yujiro Takahashi brought another title over to the Bullet Club, when he defeated Tomohiro Ishii with help from his stablemates for the NEVER Openweight Championship. With the win, Bullet Club had won every title in NJPW, now simultaneously holding all four of its heavyweight titles.|$|E
5|$|Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak {{were hired}} to {{supervise}} the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam <b>splitters,</b> camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron {{said he had to}} pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson (who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift power loader exoskeletons, which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model could not stand on its own, requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model, a stunt man standing behind it would move the arms and legs.|$|E
25|$|Splitter: A {{splitter}} or {{riving knife}} is a vertical projection located behind the saw blade. This {{can be a}} pin or a fin. It is slightly narrower in width than the blade and located directly {{in line with the}} blade. The splitter prevents the material being cut from being rotated thereby helping to prevent kickback. <b>Splitters</b> may incorporate pawls, a mechanism with teeth designed to bite into wood and preventing kickback. <b>Splitters</b> can take many forms, including being part of the blade guard that comes standard with the saw. Another type of splitter is simply a vertical pin or fin attached to an insert. <b>Splitters</b> are available commercially or can be made from wood, metal or plastic.|$|E

25|$|Shelley {{returned}} to the ring on June 21 at Dominion 6.21, where he and Kushida defeated The Young Bucks to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship {{for the second time}} as a team. On August 10, Time <b>Splitters</b> made their first successful defense of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against the ROH tag team reDRagon. Time <b>Splitters</b> made their second successful title defense on September 23 against Suzuki-gun (El Desperado and Taichi). On October 13 at King of Pro-Wrestling, Time <b>Splitters</b> made their third successful title defense in a three-way match against Forever Hooligans and The Young Bucks. On November 8 at Power Struggle, Time <b>Splitters</b> lost the title to 2014 Super Jr. Tag Tournament winners reDRagon. Time <b>Splitters</b> received a rematch for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship on January 4, 2015, at Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome, in a four-way match also involving Forever Hooligans and The Young Bucks, but were again defeated by reDRagon. On February 11 at The New Beginning in Osaka, Time <b>Splitters</b> received another title shot in a three-way match, but were this time defeated by The Young Bucks, who became the new champions. On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2015, Shelley unsuccessfully challenged Kenny Omega for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. Later that month, Shelley suffered ligament damage and an avulsion fracture in his left foot, which forced him {{to pull out of the}} 2015 Best of the Super Juniors. Shelley {{returned to}} New Japan ring in September and on September 27 at Destruction in Kobe, he and Kushida unsuccessfully challenged reDRagon for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. Following the 2015 Super Jr. Tag Tournament in November, Shelley left Japan.|$|E
25|$|The Zonda R Evolución is {{an updated}} version of the Zonda R. It {{features}} many changes over the previous Zonda R. Also the car takes many pieces and inspirations from the Zonda 760RS. It is finished in pearl white with exposed carbon-fibre on the nose. The 6.0L V12 engine is uprated to 800PS. The body work is still the same, but has improved aerodynamics. It features a bigger air splitter above the two standard air <b>splitters</b> on the front bumper and a pair of small <b>splitters</b> {{on the sides of the}} rear bumper. A bigger rear central fin— even bigger than the 760 series Zondas— and a small spoiler added below the standard Zonda R spoiler improves aerodynamics and increases down-force.|$|E

25|$|Through ROH's {{relationship}} with NJPW, reDRagon made an appearance for the Japanese promotion on August 10, unsuccessfully challenging Time <b>Splitters</b> (Alex Shelley and Kushida) for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. reDRagon returned to NJPW on October 25 {{to take part}} in the 2014 Super Jr. Tag Tournament. On November 3, reDRagon defeated The Young Bucks in the finals to win the tournament. Five days later at Power Struggle, reDRagon defeated Time <b>Splitters</b> in a rematch to become the new IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions. They made their first successful title defense on January 4, 2015, at Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome, in a four-way match against Forever Hooligans, Time <b>Splitters</b> and The Young Bucks. On February 11 at The New Beginning in Osaka, reDRagon lost the title to The Young Bucks in a three-way match, also involving Time <b>Splitters.</b> reDRagon returned to NJPW on May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2015, where they unsuccessfully challenged for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship in a three-way match with Roppongi Vice (Beretta and Rocky Romero) and The Young Bucks. Later that month, O'Reilly entered the 2015 Best of the Super Juniors. Finishing with a record of six wins and one loss, he won his block and advanced to the finals of the tournament. On June 7, O'Reilly was defeated in the finals of the tournament by Kushida. Following the tournament, reDRagon received a rematch for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship in a three-way match, also involving Roppongi Vice, but were again defeated by The Young Bucks on July 5 at Dominion 7.5 in Osaka-jo Hall. On August 16, reDRagon defeated The Young Bucks to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship for the second time. They lost the title back to The Young Bucks in a four-way match that also included Roppongi Vice and Matt Sydal and Ricochet on January 4, 2016, at Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome. On October 10 at King of Pro-Wrestling, O'Reilly received his first singles title shot in NJPW, when he unsuccessfully challenged Katsuyori Shibata for the NEVER Openweight Championship.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} primary shape parameters, such as side wall angle, offset {{distance}} and <b>splitter</b> distance, {{on the internal}} flow in classical wall-attachment devices has been examined experimentally at a Reynolds number of 16 ×(10) ^ 3. The results show how the reattachment distance, pressure distribution and velocity profile in the device {{are affected by the}} shape parameters. In particular, the influence of <b>splitter</b> distance was examined in detail. The reattachment distance decreases continuously from a value in the case of without a <b>splitter</b> to a minimum as the <b>splitter</b> distance decreases from the fully far downstream distance. In contrast, the maximum value of the reattachment distance becomes partially and slightly larger than that without a <b>splitter.</b> Thus, the effective range of <b>splitter</b> distance where the reattachment distance varies from the maximum equivalent almost to the value without a <b>splitter</b> to the mimimum is determined as the range where the ordinary wall-reattachment flow pattern is directly affected by a <b>splitter.</b> It is shown that the effective range of reattachment and <b>splitter</b> distances nondimensionalized by the correctly defined upper-limit values becomes similar for all devices reported here...|$|R

On June 9, after defeating Taka Michinoku in his semifinal match, Shelley was defeated in the finals of the tournament by Prince Devitt. On June 22 at Dominion 6.22, Time <b>Splitters</b> failed in their attempt to regain the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship from the Forever Hooligans. On September 29 at Destruction, Shelley and Kushida defeated Suzuki-gun (Taichi and Taka Michinoku) to earn another shot at the Forever Hooligans and the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. However, on October 7, New Japan announced that Shelley had suffered a back injury, which would force Time <b>Splitters</b> to back out of the title match. Shelley later revealed that he had received a severe sciatica taking a sitout powerbomb from Taichi, which marked his fourth injury in the promotion since his September 2012 return. Shelley wrestled his return match on January 4, 2014, at Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome, where he and Kushida unsuccessfully challenged The Young Bucks for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship in a four-way match, which also included the Forever Hooligans and Suzuki-gun. Time <b>Splitters</b> were victorious in a non-title rematch the following day, after which they asserted themselves as The Young Bucks' next challengers.
