5|$|Iron {{and steel}} are used widely in the {{construction}} of roads, railways, other infrastructure, appliances, and buildings. Most large modern structures, such as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a <b>steel</b> <b>skeleton.</b> Even those with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing. In addition, it sees widespread use in major appliances and cars. Despite growth in usage of aluminium, it is still the main material for car bodies. Steel is used in a variety of other construction materials, such as bolts, nails, and screws and other household products and cooking utensils.|$|E

25|$|The Flatiron Building, {{designed}} by Daniel Hudson Burnham and standing 285ft (87m) high, {{was one of}} the tallest buildings in New York City upon its completion in 1902, made possible by its <b>steel</b> <b>skeleton.</b> It {{was one of the}} first buildings designed with a steel framework, and to achieve this height with other construction methods of that time would have been very difficult. (The Tower Building, {{designed by}} Bradford Gilbert and built in 1889, is considered by some to be New York City's first skyscraper, and may have been the first building in New York City to use a skeletal steel frame, while the Home Insurance Building in Chicago, which was built in 1884, is considered the world's first skyscraper due to its <b>steel</b> <b>skeleton).</b> Subsequent buildings such as the Singer Building and the Metropolitan Life Tower were higher still.|$|E
25|$|Demolition was preceded with {{erection}} of {{a massive}} timber canopy over the sidewalks and a wire mesh over the street to protect people from falling debris. Inside, elevator shafts were converted into garbage chutes for the torn partitions and exterior masonry scrap. By May 2, the top belvedere was dismantled completely {{and most of the}} cupola masonry was removed, exposing its <b>steel</b> <b>skeleton.</b> By the end of May, most of the Stevens Building was torn down; the Gillender Building's masonry walls were removed down to the seventh floor and <b>steel</b> <b>skeleton</b> was down to eleventh floor. By June 12, all that remained of Gillender Building was a single level of its steel frame visible above protective scaffoulding. In the following four days, the ground was completely cleared; work on its underground foundations commenced a month later. The granite slabs from the Gillender Building were recycled into tombstones of the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.|$|E

The lobby is ornamented with veined marble and a terrazzo floor, the workroom has a maple parquet floor, and the postmaster's offices have oak floors.|$|E

50|$|During World War II, Aachen City Hall {{was heavily}} damaged by bombing raids, {{especially}} those occurring on 14 July 1943 and 11 April 1944. On 14 July 1943 {{the roof of}} the building and both towers burned, and afterwards the structure retained a distinctive shape due to the heat that twisted the <b>steel</b> <b>skeletons</b> inside the tower caps. The Coronation Hall was again heavily damaged and the north facing wall was moved in places up to 30 centimeters vertically. The imminent threat of collapse was staved off through the use of emergency beams that held the structure in place. Because of rain penetrating the interior of the building, its frescoes were severely affected, and five of the eight were carefully removed by Franz Stiewi and stored at the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum.|$|R

The bottle opener feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with Uzi submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nowadays {{buildings}} {{based on}} lightweight <b>steel</b> <b>skeletons</b> are widespread in civil and industrial engineering. The trapezoidal sheet or roof sandwich panels fastened to thin-walled cold-formed purlins {{can be used}} as the building envelopes. In this paper the questions of numerical analysis of thin-walled Z-purlins in the coverings made of sandwich panels are studied. Numerical analyses are performed in the program MSC. NASTRAN. A full scale model of the roof with purlins and sandwich panels is considered. Numerical analyses are based on the laboratory experiments. Results of described analyses are compared with the results of tests. These researches are done to investigate a behavior of the roof system consisted of Z-purlins and sandwich panels and to develop a correct finite element model for the design of cold-formed purlins supported by sandwich panels...|$|R
40|$|Angle {{members are}} widely used in {{light-weight}} <b>steel</b> <b>skeletons</b> and they are commonly subject to high axial force with eccentricity. Different design codes recommend varied load resistances and second-order analysis widely used in design of steel frames of doubly symmetrical sections is seldom reported. This paper fills the gap by proposing a practical second-order analysis and design method for trusses composed of angles sections. Realistic modeling of semi-rigid connections associated with one- and two-bolt end connections with flexible gusset plate and member imperfections such as initial curvatures and residual stresses is made. Load eccentricity is also simulated. The proposed method can be readily applied to reliable, robust, efficient and effective design of angle trusses and frames without the uncertain assumption of effective length.

50|$|After the fire, {{the brick}} and {{stone of the}} outer walls still stood near-complete and were {{determined}} to be structurally sound.

25|$|Building the Flatiron {{was made}} {{feasible}} by a change to New York City's building codes in 1892, which eliminated {{the requirement that}} masonry be used for fireproofing considerations. This {{opened the way for}} steel-skeleton construction. Since it employed a <b>steel</b> <b>skeleton</b> – with the steel coming from the American Bridge Company in Pennsylvania – it could be built to 22 stories (285feet) relatively easily, which would have been difficult using other construction methods of that time. It was a technique familiar to the Fuller Company, a contracting firm with considerable expertise in building such tall structures. At the vertex, the triangular tower is only 6.5 feet (2m) wide; viewed from above, this pointed end of the structure describes an acute angle of about 25 degrees.|$|E
25|$|With the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, along the intracity frontier, Potsdamer Platz now found itself physically divided in two. What had once been a busy intersection had become totally desolate. With the clearance of most of the remaining bomb-damaged buildings on both sides (on the eastern side, this was done chiefly to give border guards a clear view of would-be escapees and an uninterrupted line of fire), little was left in an area of dozens of hectares. Further demolitions occurred up until 1976 when the Haus Vaterland finally disappeared. After that, only two buildings in the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz still stood– one complete, the other in a half-ruined fragmented form: the Weinhaus Huth's <b>steel</b> <b>skeleton</b> had enabled the building to withstand the pounding of World War II virtually undamaged, and it stood out starkly amid a great levelled wasteland, although now occupied only by groups of squatters. A short distance away stood portions of the former Hotel Esplanade, including the Kaisersaal, used at various times as a much scaled-down hotel, cinema, nightclub and occasional film-set (scenes from Cabaret were shot there). Apart from these, no other buildings remained. Below ground, the U-Bahn section through Potsdamer Platz had closed entirely; although the S-Bahn line itself remained open, it suffered from a quirk of geography in that it briefly passed through East German territory en route from one part of West Berlin to another. Consequently, Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station became the most infamous of several Geisterbahnhofe (ghost stations), through which trains ran without stopping, its previously bustling platforms now decrepit, sealed off from the outside world, and patrolled by armed guards.|$|E
