5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers are not {{the same}} as Servodrive subwoofers whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven <b>servomotor.</b> The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its Servo Drive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Horizontal-axis wind {{turbines}} (HAWT) have the main rotor shaft and electrical generator {{at the top}} of a tower, and must be pointed into the wind. Small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane, while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a <b>servomotor.</b> Most have a gearbox, which turns the slow rotation of the blades into a quicker rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator.|$|E
25|$|A <b>servomotor</b> is a motor, {{very often}} {{sold as a}} {{complete}} module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control valves, such as motor-operated control valves. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.|$|E

50|$|Brushless DC motors {{are widely}} used as <b>servomotors</b> for machine tool servo drives. <b>Servomotors</b> are used for {{mechanical}} displacement, positioning or precision motion control. In the past DC stepper motors were used as servomotors; however, since they are operated with open loop control, they typically exhibit torque pulsations. Brushless DC motors are more suitable as <b>servomotors</b> since their precise motion is based upon a closed loop control system that provides tightly controlled and stable operation.|$|R

2500|$|Much of the 124's {{engineering}} {{and many of}} its features were advanced automotive technology at its introduction, incorporating innovations that have been adopted throughout the industry. It had one of the lowest coefficient of drag (Cd) of any vehicle of the time (0.28 for the 200/200D model for the European market with 185/65 R15 tires) due to its aerodynamic body, that included plastic molding for the undercarriage to streamline airflow beneath the car, reducing fuel consumption and wind noise. It had a single windscreen wiper that had an eccentric mechanism at its base that extended the wiper's reach to the top corners of the windscreen (more than if it had traveled in a simple arc). The saloon/sedan, coupés and convertibles had optional rear headrests that would fold down remotely to improve rearward visibility when required. This feature was not available for the T-model because of its specific layout (no space to store the retractable headrests), but the estate serially came with a [...] "neighbour-friendly" [...] rear door that was pulled in the shut-position silently and automatically by a sensor-controlled <b>servomotor.</b> This allowed the use of a tighter fitting rear gate, minimizing the cabin noise in the T-model - sometimes an area of concern for station wagons.|$|E

40|$|Biomimetic robots can {{potentially}} perform better than conventional robots in underwater vehicle designing. This paper describes {{the design of}} the propulsion system and depth control of a robotic fish. In this study, inspired by knife fish, we have designed and implemented an undulating fin to produce propulsive force. This undulating fin is a segmental anal fin that produces sinusoidal wave to propel the robot. The relationship between the individual fin segment and phase angles with the overall fin trajectory has also been discussed. This propulsive force can be adjusted and directed for fish robot manoeuvre by a mechanical system with two <b>servomotors.</b> These <b>servomotors</b> regulate the direction and depth of swimming.

50|$|In vitro muscle testing {{typically}} {{requires a}} <b>servomotor,</b> which can both control and detect changes in force and length. One {{end of the}} sample tissue is anchored in place, while the other {{is attached to the}} motor, and the entire muscle is bathed in Ringer's solution with oxygen bubbling through {{in order to keep the}} tissue alive and metabolically active. Muscles are stimulated to contract by applying electric current to either the nerve which innervates the muscle or the entire muscle, and the <b>servomotor</b> detects changes in force and/or length due to muscle contraction. Stimulation level is often set to the level which ensures maximal motor unit recruitment. The <b>servomotor</b> can be programmed to maintain a given force while allowing the muscle to change length, vice versa, or the muscle may be subject to more complex testing, such as in work loops. When pennate muscles are used, sonomicrometry is often used to accurately determine fiber length during the test.|$|E
50|$|The IAC {{actuator}} is an electrically controlled device, {{which gets}} its {{input from the}} vehicle's ECU. The actuator is fitted such that it either bypasses the throttle or operates the throttle butterfly valve directly. The actuator consists of a linear servo actuator <b>servomotor</b> that controls a plunger which varies air flow through the throttle body. The position of the <b>servomotor</b> and hence the amount of air bypass is controlled digitally by the engine ECU. This allows the engine's idle speed to be maintained constant.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the dynamics of}} mechanical feedback-type hydraulic <b>servomotors</b> under inertia loads is developed and experimental verification is presented. The analysis, which is developed in terms of two physical parameters, yields direct expressions for the following dynamic responses: (1) the transient response to a step input and the maximum cylinder pressure during the transient and (2) the variation of amplitude attenuation and phase shift with the frequency of a sinusoidally varying input. The validity of the analysis is demonstrated by means of recorded transient and frequency responses obtained on two <b>servomotors.</b> The calculated responses are in close agreement with the measured responses. The relations presented are readily applicable to the design {{as well as to the}} {{analysis of}} hydraulic <b>servomotors...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a synchronous control scheme for a high-speed machine tool using linear <b>servomotors.</b> The gantry machine tool is mainly composed of three linear servomotors: {{one for the}} X-axis {{and the other two}} as a parallel pair for the Y-axis. The advantage of such a structure with two parallel linear <b>servomotors</b> for a single axis is to enable the machine to operate at high speed and acceleration and to increase the stiffness and precision. However, the major concern is the precisely synchronous movement of the pair of linear <b>servomotors,</b> and to overcome this problem, a master/slave control technique is applied. Repetitive control for periodic errors compensation is also considered here. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control systems. ...|$|R
