5|$|Odell Waller (1917 – July 2, 1942) was an African American <b>sharecropper</b> from Gretna, Virginia {{executed}} for the fatal shooting {{of his white}} landlord, Oscar Wheldon Davis, on July 15, 1940. Waller unsuccessfully maintained at his trial that the killing had been in self-defense, but was convicted of a jury of white citizens who had paid the poll tax, a measure that effectively barred blacks and poor whites from jury service.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor lobbied {{behind the}} scenes for the 1934 Costigan-Wagner Bill to make lynching a federal crime, {{including}} arranging a meeting between Franklin and NAACP president Walter Francis White. Fearing he would lose the votes of Southern congressional delegations for his legislative agenda, however, Franklin refused to publicly support the bill, which proved unable to pass the Senate. In 1942, Eleanor worked with activist Pauli Murray to persuade Franklin to appeal on behalf of <b>sharecropper</b> Odell Waller, convicted of killing a white farmer during a fight; though Franklin {{sent a letter to}} Virginia Governor Colgate Darden urging him to commute the sentence to life imprisonment, Waller was executed as scheduled.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{was born}} on January 25, 1897, in Pendleton, Texas, a small town near Waco, to <b>sharecropper</b> George Johnson (also {{identified}} as Willie Johnson Sr.) and his wife, Mary Fields, who died in 1901. His family, which according to the blues historian Steven Calt included at least one younger brother named Carl, moved to the agriculturally rich community of Marlin, where Johnson {{spent most of his}} childhood. There, the Johnson family attended church—most likely the Marlin Missionary Baptist Church—every Sunday, a practice which had a lasting impact on Johnson and fueled his desire to be ordained as a Baptist minister. When Johnson was five years old, his father gave him his first instrument—a cigar box guitar.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, there were 5.5 million white tenants, <b>sharecroppers,</b> and mixed cropping/laborers in the United States; and 3 million blacks. In Tennessee, whites made up two thirds {{or more of}} the <b>sharecroppers.</b> In Mississippi, by 1900, 36% of all white farmers were tenants or <b>sharecroppers,</b> while 85% of black farmers were.|$|R

50|$|While {{living in}} Winchester, Hill became active in {{organizing}} African-American laborers, <b>sharecroppers</b> and tenant farmers. They worked for white landowners at a disadvantage, {{dependent on their}} dispersing funds and settling accounts after they sold cotton crops. The landowners seldom provided itemized accounts, often required <b>sharecroppers</b> to buy seeds and supplies from plantation stores, and sold the cotton {{according to their own}} schedules. <b>Sharecroppers</b> often struggled financially for months after delivering cotton to the landowners and before receiving any payments.|$|R
5|$|Till {{arrived in}} Money, Mississippi, on August 21, 1955. On August 24, he and cousin Curtis Jones skipped church where his great-uncle Mose Wright was preaching and joined some local boys {{as they went}} to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market to buy candy. The {{teenagers}} were children of sharecroppers and had been picking cotton all day. The market mostly served the local <b>sharecropper</b> population and was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old wife Carolyn. Carolyn {{was alone in the}} store that day; her sister-in-law was {{in the rear of the}} store watching children. Jones left Till with the other boys while Jones played checkers across the street.|$|E
5|$|With the WDL, Murray became {{active in}} the case of Odell Waller, a black Virginia <b>sharecropper</b> sentenced to death for killing his white landlord, Oscar Davis, during an argument. The WDL argued that Davis had cheated Waller in a {{settlement}} and as their argument grew more heated, Waller had shot Davis in legitimate fear of his life. Murray toured the country raising funds for Waller's appeal. She wrote to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt on Waller's behalf. Roosevelt in turn wrote to Virginia Governor James Hubert Price, asking him to guarantee that the trial was fair; she later persuaded the president to privately request Price to commute the death sentence. Through this correspondence, Murray and Eleanor Roosevelt began a friendship that would last until the latter's death two decades later. Despite the efforts of the WDL and the Roosevelts, however, the governor did not commute Waller's sentence. Waller was executed on July 2, 1942.|$|E
25|$|For example, a {{landowner}} {{may have}} a <b>sharecropper</b> farming an irrigated hayfield. The <b>sharecropper</b> uses his own equipment, and covers all the costs of fuel and fertilizer. The landowner pays the irrigation district assessments and does the irrigating himself. The <b>sharecropper</b> cuts and bales the hay, and delivers one-third of the baled hay to the landlord's feedlot. The <b>sharecropper</b> might also leave the landlord's share of the baled hay in the field, where the landlord would fetch it when he wanted hay.|$|E
50|$|J. Jacobs has {{compiled}} historical notes Schaliehoeve in 1973, but {{the document was}} never published. Much of the information in this page was taken from there. The document mentions the <b>sharecroppers</b> from 1569 till 1867, {{as well as the}} names of two <b>sharecroppers</b> before 1569.|$|R
50|$|The ASU {{organized}} numerous demands. First, in {{the face}} of farm and mill owners' attempts to cut wages and suspend food advancements, the ASU called for the continuation of advances to <b>sharecroppers.</b> Secondly, the ASU demanded that <b>sharecroppers</b> have full autonomy and control over surplus crops to sell at market. In response to <b>sharecroppers</b> being required to purchase food from the land owners, the ASU demanded that croppers be given individual plots to grow their own food. Additionally, the ASU demanded that <b>sharecroppers</b> be paid in cash instead of food advances that many times plunged the croppers further in debt. For their children, the ASU demanded education. Before it was dissolved into the Farmers Union of Alabama, in 1936, the ASU had represented nearly 10,000 workers.|$|R
50|$|Banks in the Ozarks {{frequently}} arranged rentals to tenant farmers, {{who in turn}} hired their <b>sharecroppers</b> for labor. The tenant-sharecropper system began {{before the}} Great Depression, but by 1938, there was increasing mechanization on farms. This shift allowed a single farmer to work more land, putting the <b>sharecroppers</b> out of work. Left-wing elements from the local Socialist movement, and from St. Louis, moved in to organize the <b>sharecroppers</b> into the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union. They had a highly visible, violent confrontation with state authorities in 1939.|$|R
25|$|A {{new system}} of credit, the crop lien, became closely {{associated}} with sharecropping. Under this system, a planter or merchant extended {{a line of credit}} to the <b>sharecropper</b> while taking the year's crop as collateral. The <b>sharecropper</b> could then draw food and supplies all year long. When the crop was harvested, the planter or merchants who held the lien sold the harvest for the <b>sharecropper</b> and settled the debt.|$|E
25|$|The 20th-century one-drop rule made it {{relatively}} {{difficult for}} anyone of known Black ancestry {{to be accepted}} as White. The child of an African-American <b>sharecropper</b> and a White person was considered Black by the local communities. In terms of the economics of sharecropping, such a person also would likely become a <b>sharecropper</b> as well, thus adding to the landholder or employer's labor force. In short, this theory suggests that in a 20th-century economy that benefited from sharecropping, it was useful {{to have as many}} Blacks as possible.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{arrangement}} protected sharecroppers from {{the negative effects}} of a bad crop, many sharecroppers (both black and white) remained quite poor. Arrangements typically left a third of the crop to the <b>sharecropper.</b>|$|E

50|$|As part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal {{agricultural}} program, the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) was passed. This law {{was supposed}} to bring relief to farmers by increasing cotton prices. Although planting acreages were cut, the government issued checks to the farmers as compensation. The <b>sharecroppers</b> were not happy about this legislation however. They viewed it as an evil since the planters would keep the entire checks for themselves by explaining to their tenants that they were switching from employing <b>sharecroppers</b> to day laborers. As a result, the planters would evict the <b>sharecroppers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{largest group}} of blacks worked in the cotton farms of the Deep South as <b>sharecroppers</b> or tenant farmers; a few owned their farms. Large numbers of whites also were tenant farmers and <b>sharecroppers.</b> Tenant farming {{characterized}} the cotton and tobacco production in the post-Civil War South. As the agricultural economy plummeted in the early 1930s, all farmers {{in all parts of}} the nation were badly hurt. Worst hurt were the tenant farmers (who had relatively more control) and <b>sharecroppers</b> (who had less control), as well as daily laborers (mostly black, with least control).|$|R

25|$|The <b>sharecropper</b> {{purchased}} seed, tools, and fertilizer, {{as well as}} {{food and}} clothing, on credit from a local merchant, or sometimes from a plantation store. At harvest time, the cropper would harvest the whole crop and sell it to the merchant who had extended credit. Purchases and the landowner's share were deducted and the cropper kept the difference —- or added to his debt.|$|E
