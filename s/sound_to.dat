5|$|Clicks {{are quick}} {{broadband}} burst pulses, used for sonar, although some lower-frequency broadband vocalizations may serve a non-echolocative purpose such as communication; for example, the pulsed calls of belugas. Pulses in a click train are emitted at intervals of ~35–50 milliseconds, {{and in general}} these inter-click intervals are slightly greater than the round-trip time of <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> the target.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was generally positive, praising the band's musicianship. Critics compared the band's <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> Porcupine Tree. Portnoy was ultimately dissatisfied {{with the experience of}} making the album. He performed on the second OSI album, Free, but was replaced by Gavin Harrison for Blood, the band's third album.|$|E
5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell {{the idea of}} the telephone.

5|$|A pilot {{episode was}} {{commissioned}} on 1 March 1977 and the recording was completed on 28 June 1977. Brett and Adams recounted {{different parts of}} the pilot episode's genesis, including convincing the BBC that such a programme could not be recorded with a studio audience, and insisting that the programme be recorded in stereo <b>sound.</b> <b>To</b> win the latter argument, Hitchhiker's was briefly classified internally as a drama instead of a comedy, as in 1977 BBC Radio Drama programmes were allowed to be recorded in stereo, and BBC Radio Comedy programmes were not.|$|E

5|$|Chinese Nü Yr is an {{extended}} play (EP) by producer Seamus Malliagh, known by his stage name Iglooghost, released on the Brainfeeder label on 30 October 2015. Containing elements of footwork, bass, grime and 2-step garage, the EP's sound {{is represented by}} a worm who goes through several nonsensical lands. To make Chinese Nü Yr, Malliagh first designed the cover art and then developed songs with structures and <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> fit the artwork. Upon release, the EP garnered generally favorable reviews from critics, a common praise being its unique style.|$|E
5|$|Crash noted how Knight Lore masking {{technique}} addressed issues of flicker and attribute clash, and Sinclair User appreciated how Sabreman disappeared from view when passing behind blocks. In criticism, reviewers considered Knight Lore <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> be its weakest component, though Your Spectrum and Clash also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later {{rooms of the}} castle require pixel-perfect precision, compounded by the anxiety of the running timer, and the game's animations would slow down proportional {{to the degree of}} onscreen action.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{essentially}} African American {{nature of}} ragtime, {{it is most}} commonly considered the first style of American popular music to be truly black music; ragtime brought syncopation and a more authentic black <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> popular music. Popular ragtime songs were notated and sold as sheet music, but the general style was played more informally across the nation; these amateur performers played a more free-flowing form of ragtime that eventually became a major formative influence on jazz.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} bankruptcy, Rail Management {{established}} a new company, Ofotbanen Drift AS, {{to take over}} the estate in bankruptcy. They also stated that the cause of the bankruptcy was that Autolink had not let them make a private placement of NOK 10 million. The new company received an operation and safety licence from the inspectorate in January 2009, and plans to start operation again in February. On 9 April 2010, the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate withdrew Ofotbanen's operating certificate because it was not economically <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> operate. The company filed for bankruptcy in May, after the Norwegian Tax Administration could not claim NOK700,000 in due taxes.|$|E
