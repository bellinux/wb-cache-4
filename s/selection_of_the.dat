5|$|The I-5 and the I-6 were {{virtually}} identical in performance, although the I-6 took 15 seconds {{to complete a}} full circle versus the 9.5 seconds of the I-5. Both aircraft were armed with two 7.62mm (0.3in) PV-1 machine guns, but the production model of the I-5 {{was expected to be}} armed with four, although this proved to impose too great a penalty to the I-5's performance. The exact reasons for the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> I-5 over the I-6, which was debated for a full year, are not known, but likely relate to both of these factors.
