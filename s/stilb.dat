50|$|Peter <b>Stilbs</b> (born 1 June 1945) is an emeritus {{professor}} in physical chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stilbs</b> {{earned a}} master's degree in {{chemical}} engineering from the Lund Institute of Technology at Lund University in 1969, and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1974. He {{served as a}} research assistant in physical chemistry at Uppsala University from 1976 to 1982, and as an assistant professor from 1982 to 1986. In 1986 he became a professor in physical chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. His main fields of research are the techniques and applications of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).|$|R
50|$|<b>Stilbs</b> {{has also}} {{been active in the}} debate on global warming. He has criticised the view that there is a {{scientific}} consensus on the attribution of recent climate change, and described the climate projections conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as inadequate and misleading. In September 2006 he was chairman of an international seminar at the Royal Institute of Technology labelled Global Warming - Scientific Controversies in Climate Variability, where both critics and supporters of the theory of man-made global warming were invited.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Stilb</b> [...] at A Dictionary of Units of Measurement, Russ Rowlett and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Accessed June 2008.|$|E
50|$|In 1894 he {{proposed}} the lumen {{and other new}} measurement units for use in photometry, based on the metre and the Violle candle. He coined {{the names of the}} phot and the <b>stilb</b> around 1920.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>stilb</b> (sb) is the CGS unit of {{luminance}} for {{objects that}} are not self-luminous. It is equal to one candela per square centimeter or 104 nits (candelas per square meter). The name was coined by the French physicist André Blondel around 1920. It comes from the Greek word stilbein meaning [...] "to glitter".|$|E
50|$|It was {{in common}} use in Europe up to World War I. In North America self-explanatory {{terms such as}} candle per square inch and candle per square meter were more common. The unit has since largely been {{replaced}} by the SI unit: candela per square meter. The current national standard for SI in the United States discourages the use of the <b>stilb.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Luminance is a {{photometric}} {{measure of}} the luminous intensity per unit area of light travelling in a given direction. It describes the amount of light that passes through, is emitted or reflected from a particular area, and falls within a given solid angle. The SI unit for luminance is candela per square metre (cd/m2). A non-SI term for the same unit is the [...] "nit". The CGS unit of luminance is the <b>stilb,</b> which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10 kcd/m2.|$|E
50|$|Measurement {{of light}} or {{photometry}} is generally {{concerned with the}} amount of useful light falling on a surface and the amount of light emerging from a lamp or other source, along with the colors that can be rendered by this light. The human eye responds differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum, therefore photometric measurements must take the luminosity function into account when measuring the amount of useful light. The basic SI unit of measurement is the candela (cd), which describes the luminous intensity, all other photometric units are derived from the candela. Luminance for instance {{is a measure of the}} density of luminous intensity in a given direction. It describes the amount of light that passes through or is emitted from a particular area, and falls within a given solid angle. The SI unit for luminance is candela per square metre (cd/m2). The CGS unit of luminance is the <b>stilb,</b> which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10 kcd/m2. The amount of useful light emitted from a source or the luminous flux is measured in lumen (lm).|$|E
