40|$|My {{first contact}} with {{patients}} suffering from congestiveheart failure occurred in 1952, just {{a half century}} ago. As a medical student at New York University I was assigned to a heart failure clinic, {{one of the first}} devoted entirely to patients with this condition, and a haemodynamic laboratory under the leadership of Professor Ludwig W. Eichna, a pio-neer clinical investigator of heart failure. The patients with heart failure whom I encountered usually had hypertension or rheumatic valvular disease (Tab. 1). The suggested under-lying mechanism – “exhaustion of the overloaded ventricle ” – had not changed since it had been proposed by Osler more than a half century earlier.

40|$|The {{attitude}} towards prophylaxis and therapy of {{several generations of}} clinicians has {{been influenced by the}} idea that toxemia of pregnancy results from an abnormal retention of salt and water, which is responsible for edema and an abnormal increase in weight. Neither the overall increase in weight, often underestimated in normal pregnancies, nor the speed of the gain in weight can scientifically be considered as premonitory signs of this disease. Edema by itself, without any sign of other pathology has no poor prognostic significance. It may even appear to be a normal physiological adaptation of the maternal organism to the state of pregnancy. The pathologic physiology of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system during normal pregnancy and abnormal pregnancy is discussed. It seems that the state of pregnancy brings about an increased need for salt and that the pathology of toxemia is accompanied by the exhaustion of the capacity of the kidney and the adrenal cortex to secrete renin. A critical review of the literature does not confirm that either diuretics or the <b>salt</b> <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> is effective in prevention or treatment of toxemia of pregnancy.

Immunostimulants especially when administered through the diet have been potentially playing an important role in aquaculture. Banana fruit peels are generally considered as waste, but recently antifungal, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties are explored in the peel. The banana is nourishing, doesn’t contain fat, and can be eaten at every hour of the day because of its digestive properties. The banana contains magnesium, selenium, iron, a lot of vitamins and is recommended for <b>salt</b> <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> because of its low content in sodium chloride. Generally, the peel is being thrown once the pulp is eaten. These peels are eaten by animals or sometimes degraded by nature. Our aim is to extract few vital substances. The protein content of the peel was estimated qualitatively and quantitatively. The extract was injected into Clarias batrachus and its immune cells were counted. The result shows the wasted peel has both lower and higher molecular weights and has an immunological response as it showed an increase in the immune cells and there were very less cellular distortions when histopathological observations was done...|$|E

DESIGN [...] Four way, randomised, crossover trial of four consecutive two week dietary regimens: normal <b>diet,</b> caffeine <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> alone, caffeine <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> with decaffeinated instant coffee, caffeine <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> with caffeinated instant coffee (instant coffee phases conducted double blind). SETTING [...] Hospital hypertension clinic, Scotland. PATIENTS [...] 52 patients (23 men; aged 26 - 67 years) with untreated borderline or mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90 - 105 mm Hg) who normally drank {{a minimum of three}} cups of coffee daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Mean ambulatory blood pressure over 24 hours; mean morning, daytime, and night time ambulatory blood pressure; sitting clinic blood pressure at 1700; plasma caffeine concentration at 1700 {{on the last day of}} each regimen. RESULTS [...] Mean 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure was not different between regimens. There was no difference in blood pressure variability between regimens. During the caffeine <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> alone morning ambulatory diastolic blood pressure was higher (2. 8 mm Hg) than during the caffeine <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> with caffeinated coffee. Mean sitting clinic systolic blood pressure was higher at 1700 (4. 7 mm Hg) with a caffeine <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> than with the caffeine <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> with caffeinated coffee (p less than 0. 05). Dietary compliance as assessed by plasma caffeine concentration was excellent. There was no significant correlation between plasma caffeine concentration and blood pressure.

Nineteen had been {{diagnosed}} in adult life (ACD) and nine in childhood (CCD). Patients were assessed on jejunal, morphological, and symptomatic parameters. Eighteen patients with ACD relapsed within seven weeks. Nine patients with CCD relapsed at variable times but five took longer than seven weeks, the longest period being 10 months. Seven patients had no symptoms despite morphological deterioration during challenge and one patient, with ACD, did not relapse and was HLA B 8 negative.

Thirty children with no food restriction (mean age = 16. 8 months) were also assessed. The usual daily food intake method was used to make the dietary assessment. The food intake was compared between the groups and in relation to the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). The z-scores for weight/age, height/age and weight/height were used to evaluate the nutritional status. Results: The cows milk <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> group presented lower energy (p = 0. 005), protein (p < 0. 001), lipid (p <  0. 001), calcium (p < 0. 001) and phosphorous (p < 0. 001) intake when compared to the control group. The number of children who had energy, calcium and phosphorous intake below the DRIs was higher in the cows milk <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> group than in the control group.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Recent {{research}} suggests that oats do not harm intestinal villi in adults with coeliac disease. As the immunological effects of oats have not been examined in detail, {{it was decided to}} compare the immunological responses of a gluten <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> including oats with those of a conventional gluten <b>free</b> <b>diet.</b>  DESIGN—A randomised controlled intervention study over 6 - 12 months.  SUBJECTS—Forty adults with newly diagnosed coeliac disease and 52  with coeliac disease in remission were examined.  INTERVENTION—The effects of a gluten <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> including oats and a conventional gluten <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> were compared.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Serum levels of gliadin and reticulin antibodies as well as numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in intestinal mucosa were examined before and after the intervention.  RESULTS—The rate of disappearance of gliadin and reticulin antibodies did not differ between the diet groups in patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease. Oats also had no effect on gliadin or reticulin antibody levels in the patients with remission. The number of IELs decreased similarly regardless of the diet of newly diagnosed patients, and no {{increase in the number of}} IELs was found in the patients in remission with or without oats.  CONCLUSIONS—These results strengthen the view that adult patients with coeliac disease can consume moderate amounts of oats without adverse immunological effects.    Keywords: coeliac disease; diet; oats; anti-gliadin antibodies; anti-reticulin antibodies; intraepithelial lymphocyte...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 10539 Coeliac {{disease is}} a chronic {{autoimmune}} disorder of the small intestine characterised by infiltration of intraepithelial lymphocytes, crypt hyperplasia and villous atrophy. It develops in genetically susceptible individuals following exposure to gluten. The only treatment is dietary and all sources of gluten must be permanently removed from the diet. On the basis of studies {{carried out in the}} 1930 s and 1940 s, wheat, barley, rye and oats were deemed to be harmful for coeliac patients and the exclusion of these four grains was the basis of the gluten <b>free</b> <b>diet.</b> However, the true toxicity of oats has more recently been questioned and although {{a number of studies have}} indicated oats to be safe for coeliac patients there have also been reports of adverse effects as a result of oats addition to the gluten <b>free</b> <b>diet.</b> The gluten <b>free</b> <b>diet</b> is difficult to maintain and often high in fat and low in fibre, vitamins and other nutrients. The addition of oats to this diet would have both lifestyle and nutritional benefits.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dietary {{habits are}} often {{considered}} {{to be responsible for}} fatty liver, a common histological finding in human liver biopsies. The aim of the present work was to test the hypothesis that fasting followed by refeeding high carbohydrate-fat <b>free</b> <b>diets</b> in rats disrupts hepatic lipid homeostasis, leading to liver lipid accumulation and morphological alterations. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fasted for 48 h, then refed ad libitum with a high carbohydrate-fat <b>free</b> <b>diet.</b> RESULTS: Six hours after refeeding, a slight microvacuolar steatosis, mainly located in zone I was observed, whereas later on in the process, macrovacuolar steatosis extended to all three zones of the hepatic lobules.
