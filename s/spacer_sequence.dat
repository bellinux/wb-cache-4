The recent discovery of CRISPR (clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) loci within bacterial and archaeal cellular genomes may provide an alternative approach to detect new viruses. It {{has been shown that}} the <b>spacer</b> <b>sequences</b> between the direct repeat units of the CRISPR loci are often derived from viruses and likely function as guide sequences to protect the cell from viral infection. The <b>spacer</b> <b>sequences</b> within the CRISPR loci may therefore serve as a record of the viruses that have replicated within the cell. We have cataloged the CRISPR <b>spacer</b> <b>sequences</b> from cellular metagenomic data from high-temperature (> 80 °C), acidic (pH < 4) hot spring environments located in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). We designed a microarray platform utilizing these CRISPR <b>spacer</b> <b>sequences</b> as potential probes to detect viruses present in YNP hot spring environments. We show that this microarray approach can detect viral sequences directly from virus-enriched environmental samples, detecting new viruses which have not been previously characterized.

Our results demonstrate that CRISPR spacer sequence-based microarrays will be useful tools for detecting and monitoring viruses from diverse environmental samples...|$|R

50|$|Ribosome display {{begins with}} a native library of DNA {{sequences}} coding for polypeptides. Each sequence is transcribed, and then translated in vitro into polypeptide. However, the DNA library coding for a particular library of binding proteins is genetically fused to a <b>spacer</b> <b>sequence</b> lacking a stop codon before its end. The lack of a stop codon prevents release factors from binding and triggering the disassembly of the translational complex. So, this <b>spacer</b> <b>sequence</b> stays attached to the peptidyl tRNA and occupies the ribosomal tunnel, and thus allows the protein of interest to protrude out of the ribosome and fold. What results is a complex of mRNA, ribosome, and protein which can bind to surface-bound ligand.

50|$|RSSs {{are made}} up of conserved heptamer {{sequences}} (7 base pairs), <b>spacer</b> <b>sequences,</b> and conserved nonamer sequences (9 base pairs) that are adjacent to the V, D and J sequences in the heavy-chain region of DNA and the V and J sequences in the light-chain DNA region. <b>Spacer</b> <b>sequences</b> are located between heptamer and nonamer sequences and exhibit base pair variety but are always either 12 base pairs or 23 base pairs long. Unlike <b>spacer</b> <b>sequences,</b> heptamer sequences are usually CACAGTG, and the first three nucleotides are highly conserved. Nonamers are usually ACAAAAACC, and the A/T basepairs are also highly conserved. The RAG1/RAG2 enzyme complex follows the 12-23 rule when joining V,D, and J segments, pairing 12-bp spacer RSSs to 23-bp spacer RSSs. This prevents two different genes coding for the same region from recombining (ex. V-V recombination). RSSs are located between V,D, and J segments of the germ-line DNA of maturing B and T lymphocytes and are permanently spliced out of the final Ig mRNA product after V(D)J recombination is complete.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{clustered}} regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat - CRISPR-associated genes (CRISPR-Cas) {{system is}} used by bacteria and archaea against invading conjugative plasmids or bacteriophages. Central to this immunity system are genomic CRISPR loci that contain fragments of invading DNA. These are maintained as spacers in the CRISPR loci between direct repeats and the spacer composition in any bacterium reflects its evolutionary history. We analysed the CRISPR locus sequences of 335 Yersinia pseudotuberculosis complex strains. Altogether 1902 different <b>spacer</b> <b>sequences</b> were identified and these were used to generate a database for the <b>spacer</b> <b>sequences.</b> Only ∼ 10 % of the <b>spacer</b> <b>sequences</b> found matching sequences.

[*]pseudotuberculosis strains indicating that these strains had encountered pYptb 32953 earlier. In conjugation experiments, pYptb 32953 -specific spacers generally prevented conjugation with spacer-positive and spacer-free strains. However, some strains with one to four spacers were invaded by pYptb 32953 and some spacer-free strains were fully resistant. Also some spacer-positive strains were intermediate resistant to conjugation. This suggests that one or more other defence systems are determining conjugation efficiency independent of the CRISPR-Cas system...|$|R

50|$|These {{types of}} NLSs {{can be further}} {{classified}} as either monopartite or bipartite.

The first NLS to be discovered was the sequence PKKKRKV in the SV40 Large T-antigen (a monopartite NLS). The NLS of nucleoplasmin, KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK, is the prototype of the ubiquitous bipartite signal: two clusters of basic amino acids, separated by a spacer of about 10 amino acids. Both signals are recognized by importin α. Importin α contains a bipartite NLS itself, which is specifically recognized by importin β. The latter can be considered the actual import mediator.|$|E

In addition, the Cas proteins Cas 1 (a dsDNA endonuclease) and Cas 2 (a dsDNA and/or ssRNA endonuclease) function to integrate new <b>spacer</b> <b>sequences</b> into the crRNA array, an adaptation phase that allows bacteria to subsequently target foreign genetic elements containing these sequences [3, 4]...|$|R

50|$|Ubiquitin {{is one of}} {{the most}} conserved {{proteins}} known in eukaryotic organisms. Ubiquitin is required for ATP-dependent, non-lysosomal intracellular protein degradation of abnormal proteins and normal proteins with a rapid turnover. Ubiquitin is covalently bound to proteins to be degraded, and presumably labels these proteins for degradation. Ubiquitin also binds to histone H2A in actively transcribed regions but does not cause histone H2A degradation, suggesting that ubiquitin is also involved in regulation of gene expression. This gene consists of three direct repeats of the ubiquitin coding sequence with no <b>spacer</b> <b>sequence.</b> Consequently, the protein is expressed as a polyubiquitin precursor with a final amino acid after the last repeat. Aberrant form of this protein (UBB+1) has been noticed in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, other tauopathies (e.g. Pick's disease) and polyglutamine disease (e.g. Huntington's disease).|$|E
50|$|Being {{intermediate}} between sea {{and fresh}} water, the Baltic Sea, {{and especially the}} Gulf of Bothnia, has a low biodiversity and supports {{only a small number}} of plant and animal species that have been able to adapt to this level of salinity.

Studies to find their evolutionary relationship using chloroplast (RuBisCO gene) or mitochondrial DNA (intergenic <b>spacer)</b> <b>sequence</b> markers have been inconclusive. Genetic analysis using microsatellite markers (short DNA sequences) suggests that a divergence between the two species occurred between 125 and 2475 years ago with a posterior distribution peak at around 400 years ago. This means the species would have diverged more recently than the transition of the Baltic Sea from a marine environment to its present brackish state. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that F. radicans is found nowhere else other than the Baltic.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBovine liver 5 ′-nucleotidase is a GPI-anchored protein whose Ser 523 {{attaches}} to GPI as the ω-site.

We have analysed community genomic data from acidophilic microbial biofilms and discovered that evolution of the CRISPR regions in two distinct Leptospirillum group II bacteria occurs fast enough to promote individuality in otherwise nearly clonal populations. Comparative genomics strongly indicates very recent lateral transfer of the CRISPR locus between these populations, followed by significant loss of <b>spacer</b> <b>sequences</b> and locus expansion by unidirectional heterogeneous addition of new <b>spacer</b> <b>sequences.</b> Diversification of the CRISPR region is inferred to be a population-level response to the rapidly changing selective pressure of phage predation.

However, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for the PVY sequence of the transgene and none specific for the LNYV <b>spacer</b> <b>sequence</b> were detected. Following infection with Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), which suppresses dsRNA-induced RNA silencing, transcript levels of PVY-NIa as well as <b>spacer</b> <b>sequence</b> increased manifold with the same time course.
