40|$|This study {{examines}} factors that explain {{the creation of}} university <b>spin-offs.</b> The study focuses on mechanisms that technology transfer offices (TTOs) and universities employ to foster <b>spin-offs.</b> These mechanisms include technology transfer activities that support <b>spin-offs,</b> normative frameworks, support infrastructures (i. e., business incubators and science parks), and TTO staff's specialist technical skills. The analysis also differentiates {{between public and private}} universities. <b>Spin-offs</b> belong to {{one or more of the}} following groups: <b>spin-offs</b> with support from the university's TTO, <b>spin-offs</b> operating under a license agreement, and <b>spin-offs</b> in which the TTO or university holds equity. Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) of 2011 data from 63 Spanish universities (46 public and 17 private) identifies recipes of antecedent conditions that effectively foster <b>spin-offs.</b> Results show that no unique combination of antecedent conditions yields more university <b>spin-offs</b> than any other does. This finding indicates that several strategies can successfully lead to academic entrepreneurship. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Innovative start-ups, {{including}} <b>spin-offs</b> from {{universities and}} companies, {{play a vital}} role in the development and growth of emerging, high-technology industries. Research attention has traditionally focused on the links between demographic, educational, psychological and financial influences on start-up activity and growth. The extent to which the characteristics of technology inherited from the parent, important for <b>spin-offs,</b> helps explain post start-up performance has been neglected. We analyse the scope and newness of the endowed technology as a predictor of post-spin-off growth for corporate and university <b>spin-offs.</b> Using a novel, hand-collected dataset, 48 corporate and 73 university <b>spin-offs</b> were identified, comprising the whole population of such <b>spin-offs</b> in Flanders over the period 1991 - 2002. We find that corporate <b>spin-offs</b> seem to benefit from a narrow scope of technology and a high level of newness of technology, while university <b>spin-offs</b> benefit from a broad scope of technology and a lower level of newness of technology. We conclude that the same choice of technology endowments may have a different impact on the spin-offs’ growth, since <b>spin-offs</b> start with different knowledge inheritance. technology endowment, corporate <b>spin-offs,</b> university <b>spin-offs...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of firm demography, <b>spin-offs</b> have {{recently}} attracted attention as a very successful form of new firm formation. Policy makers see <b>spin-offs</b> as particularly fertile innovators in an economy. Theoretically, following lines of thought from the resource-based theory, <b>spin-offs</b> are also expected to perform better than other start-ups that lack the resource base <b>spin-offs</b> inherited from their mother companies. This paper shows, based on an empirical study of American entrepreneurs (ERC-dataset) that <b>spin-offs</b> are indeed {{a step ahead of}} firms that do not receive support from a third party company. In the early stages of their existence, <b>spin-offs</b> are leading other new firms in the development of their products, <b>spin-offs</b> show an increased tendency to hire personnel, and <b>spin-offs</b> receive their first income sooner than other firms. At start-up, spin-outs hardly differ from individual start-ups, which have not received any back-up during the gestation process. After one year they seem to perform slightly better. ...|$|R
5|$|On May 16, 2017, Channing Dungey {{announced}} at the ABC Upfronts that the network ordered another Grey's Anatomy <b>spin-off,</b> this one focusing on firefighters in Seattle. The series is set to premiere mid-season in 2018. Stacy McKee, long-term Grey's writer and executive producer, {{will serve as the}} spin-off's showrunner. The new show will most likely be introduced during an episode of Grey's Anatomy next season. In July 2017, it was announced that Jaina Lee Ortiz was the first actress cast in the <b>spin-off</b> series. In September 2017 it was announced that Jason George, who has played Dr. Ben Warren since season 6, would be leaving Grey's Anatomy to move to the <b>spin-off.</b> He's expected to be a series regular on Grey's Anatomy until the <b>spin-off</b> begins production. In October 2017 it was announced that five new series regulars for the spin off had been cast being Grey Damon, Jay Hayden, Okieriete Onaodowan, Danielle Savre and Barrett Doss. It was also announced that the <b>spin-off</b> had a 10 episode order for the first season. Later in October 2017, it was announced that Miguel Sandoval was cast as the Captain of the firehouse.|$|E

40|$|A {{persistent}} question surrounding corporate <b>spin-offs</b> is: ‘What {{accounts for}} the performance of corporate <b>spin-offs?</b> In {{order to be able to}} provide an answer to this question, we have reviewed the literature on corporate <b>spin-offs.</b> We found that after two decades of studying corporate <b>spin-offs,</b> the literature remains fragmented with little efforts at accumulation, the empirical work infrequently build upon one another. Therefore, we have designed a model of antecedents and characteristics of corporate <b>spin-offs</b> by identifying the key dimensions that contribute to the performance of a CSO. ...|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{entrepreneurship}} {{and corporate}} <b>spin-offs</b> have gained importance {{over the last}} decades. Corporate <b>spin-offs</b> play an increasingly {{important role in the}} development and growth of emerging, high-technology industries, thereby contributing to economic growth. While previous studies on corporate <b>spin-offs</b> have taken the established firm as a point of departure, a central issue concerns the locus of entrepreneurs. We adopt a bottom-up approach by considering those <b>spin-offs</b> that are created by employees, based upon an opportunity spotted while working for the parent company. Based upon the knowledge-based theory of the firm and the literature on opportunity identification, we develop a typology of corporate <b>spin-offs.</b> We identified three types of corporate spin-offs: Assisted spin-outs, Restructuring-driven spin-outs and Entrepreneurial <b>Spin-offs.</b> These types of corporate <b>spin-offs</b> differ from each other in terms of nature and formality of knowledge transfer; detection and implementation of opportunity identification; and performance. Based upon an in-depth analysis of 41 corporate <b>spin-offs</b> in Flanders, we found that Entrepreneurial <b>Spin-offs</b> outperform both Assisted and Restructuring-driven spin-outs on all four performance indicators. Our findings imply that parent companies often miss possibilities to capture value from opportunities that were originally developed in the parent company. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{large number}} of <b>spin-off</b> video games have also been made for the Final Fantasy series.

Dissidia Final Fantasy, on the other hand, is a fighting game using characters from the main series exclusively. Overall, more than 30 games have been released as spin-offs of the main Final Fantasy series, many within their own sub-series.|$|E

5|$|A <b>spin-off</b> titled Summer Days, was {{released}} on June 23, 2006, retelling the original game during summer vacation and {{from the perspective of}} Setsuna Kiyoura. Unlike its predecessor, however, Summer Days was almost universally panned for its heavily bugged state, loads of patches, and recall. Another <b>spin-off</b> titled Cross Days {{was released}} on March 19, 2010. Set in the same continuity as School Days, Cross Days follows the life of another protagonist, Yuuki Ashikaga, a high school freshman who also finds himself caught between the affection of two girls, Roka Kitsuregawa and Kotonoha Katsura, during his second term at Sakakino Academy. The game also features yaoi scenarios, during which Yuuki cross-dresses as a maid. 0verflow released Shiny Days on February 2, 2012 which establishes a solid link between the Days series and Radish Vacation series. A third <b>spin-off,</b> Island Days, was developed for the Nintendo 3DS and was released in Japan on July 3, 2014. The game, developed by Klon, focuses on Makoto and the girls becoming trapped on a remote island and includes tower defense elements.|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} origin from universities, {{academic}} <b>spin‐offs</b> operate {{at the forefront}} of the technological development. Therefore, <b>spin‐offs</b> exhibit a skill‐biased labour demand, i. e. <b>spin‐offs</b> have a high demand for employees with cutting edge knowledge and technical skills. In order to accommodate this demand, <b>spin‐offs</b> may have to pay a relative wage premium compared to other high‐tech start‐ups. However, neither a comprehensive theoretical assessment nor the empirical literature on wages in start‐ups unambiguously predicts the existence and the direction of wage differentials between <b>spin‐offs</b> and non‐spin‐offs. This paper addresses this research gap and examines empirically whether or not <b>spin‐offs</b> pay their employees a wage premium. Using a unique linked employer‐employee data set of German high‐tech start‐ups, we estimate Mincer‐type wage regressions applying the Hausman‐Taylor panel estimator. Our results show that <b>spin‐offs</b> do not pay a wage premium in general. However, a notable exception from this general result is that <b>spin‐offs</b> that commercialise new scientific results or methods provide higher wages to employees with linkages to the university sector – either as university graduates or as student workers. ...|$|R

The paper has two main objectives: to analyse the governance models adopted by academic <b>spin-offs</b> and to ascertain whether the very nature of entrepreneurial opportunity, and the associated uncertainties that a new venture faces, influence the choice of the governance model adopted.
