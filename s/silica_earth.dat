Silica dust provoked pronounced pulmonary fibrosis as inferred from increased collagen content together with pathomorphological alteration (silicotic nodules). The lung burden of silica dust affected the lysosomal subfraction as manifested {{by an increase in}} its protein content with concomitant stimulation (release and presumably induction) of beta-glucuronidase and cathepsin D and a transient (up to three months) stimulation of lipid peroxidation. Stimulation of activity of lysosomal enzymes and lipid peroxidation mediated by silica dust may reflect destructive metabolic processes resulting in the development of pulmonary fibrosis as the sign of a pathological repair mechanism.

In this study, a single protocol was used to test different silica samples (i. e., 2 non-crystalline samples: one vitreous <b>silica,</b> one diatomaceous <b>earth,</b> 4 crystalline samples: one pure a-quartz ground in a wet atmosphere, one of the same quartz heated until it becomes oc-cristobalite and 2 cristobalites obtained by heating diatomaceous earth). Wistar rats received a single intra-tracheal injection of alveolar dust and were followed over a period of 3 months. The results were exploited using macroscopic examination (wet lung weight), histological examination and biochemical dosing (hydroxyproline, lipid, and silica content).

40|$|Crude {{fish oil}} is an {{important}} ingredient in fish feed for fish farming; {{it can be used}} as functional food or neutraceutical (cod liver oil, EPA/DHA concentrates) or incorporated in healthy foods after refining. Major components of fish oil have positive nutritional properties. Polyunsaturated fatty acids can go up to 40 % with variable proportions of EPA (C 20 : 5) and DHA (C 22 - 6) [ω- 3 fatty acids]. Content of fat soluble vitamins is usually high. Unfortunately, fish oil is also sensitive to degradation products (polymeric and oxidized fat, increased polar content, off-flavor problems…). The beneficial nutritional properties of fish oil are in great contrast with the presence of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins and -furans (PCDDs/PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mainly originating from the environment. Usual steps for fish oil refining are neutralization, bleaching, winterization (optional) and deodorization. Processing difficulties consist in finding the best operating conditions for an effective removal of unwanted contaminants and a maximal preservation of the nutritional qualities (processing duality). In this work, different adsorbents (filter aid, <b>silica</b> powder, bleaching <b>earth</b> and active carbon) were tested for the best removal of PCDDs/PCDFs and PCBs; it was shown that filter aid, <b>silica</b> and bleaching <b>earth</b> have no significant effect on decontamination while removal of majority non ortho PCBs and PCDDs/PCDFs was possible with active carbon. Mono-ortho PCBs were significantly less absorbed by active carbon. Deodorization was further investigated. Processing temperature had a very pronounced effect on the reduction of PCDDs/PCDFs and PCBs. Already at 210 °C, all of them were removed efficiently to a level below the limit set by European Legislation. But temperature increase was limited by the risk of degradation of EPA/DHA (ω- 3). Combination of active carbon treatment and deodorization was shown to be the best compromise to remove majority of the contaminants and to preserve the nutritional quality of fish oil. At low active carbon dosage and deodorization temperature below 200 °C, the total contamination level of PCDDs/PCDFs and PCBs can be reduced below level imposed by European Legislation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{effectiveness}} of physically acting substances (oils and silicas) and plant preparations for the control of the poultry red mite Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer 1778). Reproduction and survival of fed D. gallinae females were evaluated in vitro for a total of 168 h using the ‘‘area under the survival curve’’ (AUC) to compare survival of the mites between treatments. Four oils (two plant oils, one petroleum spray oil and diesel), one soap, three silicas (one synthetic amorphous <b>silica,</b> one diatomaceous <b>earth</b> (DE) and one DE with 2 % pyrethrum extract) and seven plant preparations (derived from Chrysanthemum cineariaefolium, Allium sativum, Tanacetum vulgare, Yucca schidigera, Quillaja saponaria, Dryopteris filix-mas, and Thuja occidentalis) were tested at various concentrations. All the oils, diesel and soap signifi-cantly reduced D. gallinae survival. All silicas tested inhibited reproduction.

40|$|Acid–base titrations {{were carried}} out at three {{different}} ionic strengths (0. 01, 0. 1 and 0. 7 M NaCl) {{on a range of}} marine and continental biosiliceous materials. The large variability in electrical charging behavior of the various materials is consistent with the existence of two pools of ionizable groups, one on the outer surface of and the other within the silica particles. The relative amounts of internal and external silanols were estimated by fitting a two-site complexation model to excess proton versus pH curves obtained at the different ionic strengths. For fresh diatom frustules and phytoliths, as well as recently deposited biosiliceous sediments, the abundance of internal silanols was of the same order of magnitude as, or exceeded, that of silanols on the external surface. Older biosiliceous materials exhibited lower proportions of internal groups, while a decrease in the relative amount of internal silanols was also observed for diatom frustules artificially aged in seawater. The existence of internal ionizable functional groups explains measured charge densities of biogenic silicas that largely exceed the theoretical site density of silica surfaces. Variations in the relative abundance of internal versus surface silanols further explain the non-uniform dependence of electrical charging on ionic strength, the lack of correlation between total charge density and dissolution kinetics, and the variable 950 cm 1 peak intensity in the infrared spectra of biogenic silicas. Dissolution rates correlate positively with the external charge, rather than the total charge build-up, as expected if dissolution only involves the removal of silicate units from the external surfaces of the particles. The progressive reduction with time of the internal to external silanol concentration ratio represents one of the mechanisms altering the material properties that affect the recycling and preservation of biogenic <b>silica</b> in <b>earth</b> surface environment...|$|R

Biogenic CaCO 3 from various marine forms was tested for the potential to function as precursor for CaO-based CO 2 sorbents. The porosity and elemental content were put in context with the reactivity reached and stability encountered during repeated carbonation-calcination cycles. CaCO 3 templated on biopolymers exhibited various morphologies, but did not show an increased performance. Synthetic polymers were able to structure mesoporous CaO that gave rise to a sorbent with increased CO 2 uptake capacity.

The lifespan of the spicule can be estimated to 11, 000 +/- 3000 years using the long-term trend of the inferred temperatures fitted to the seawater temperature age relationships since the Last Glacial Maximum. Specimens of Monorhaphis therefore represents one the oldest living animals on Earth. The remarkable temperature spikes of the ambient seawater occurring 9500 - 3100 years B.

30|$|For {{the sample}} {{characterization}} {{according to its}} degree of esterification and amount of pigments, we used the AOAC official method 970.64 with the modifications introduced by Fletcher (2006). The difference with the original method is that the saponification step is omitted and larger volumes of elution solvents are used; also, the final dilution is greater than in the original method. With this method {{we were able to}} separate the fractions, those which had their xanthophylls quantified and those which had their degree of esterification measured. Thus, the pigments were classified as di-esters (E), monohydroxy pigments (MHP), free pigments or dihydroxy pigments (DHP), and residual pigments or polyols (RP). The content of xanthophylls was expressed as equivalents of trans-luteins. To extract the pigments, we dissolved 50  mg of oleoresin and 5  mL of the culture broth sample in 30  mL of HEAT using a 100  mL volumetric flask, adding 2  mL of methanol. After stirring, we left this mix in the dark for 1  h before conducting any analysis. Subsequently, the pigments were separated by open column chromatography. The column was 12.5  mm i.d. X 30  cm, with Teflon stopcock; the column was 2  mm i.d. and 10  cm long. The stationary phase comprised a mixture of <b>silica</b> gel–diatomaceous <b>earth</b> (1 / 1, w/w) activated by drying. The activation was carried out by heating in an oven for 24  h at 90  °C. The mixture was then cooled and stored in a desiccator before use. The column was packed with 7  cm of stationary phase and 2  cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate. After the column was packed and connected to a Buchner flask, an aspirator was connected to one of the ends of the flask to initiate the separation; the amount of sample of the extraction solution was 5  mL. We used four eluents: for carotenes and esters, hexane/acetone (96 / 4, v/v); for MHP, hexane/acetone (90 / 10, v/v); for DHP, hexane/acetone (80 / 20, v/v); for RP, hexane/methanol/acetone (80 / 10 / 10, v/v/v). The eluents were added in the same order until the corresponding fraction was recovered, which was then immediately transferred to the next solvent. Once the desired fraction was obtained, it was diluted with a known volume (25, 50 or 100  mL) of water, and its absorbance was read at 474  nm using the elution solvent as the blank. After determining the amount of pigments in each band or fraction, we calculated their percentage share of the total. In order to obtain ester-free lutein, we saponified a known amount of oleoresin, followed by open column chromatography in which the third band (corresponding to the DHP) was recovered. Lutein was identified by its spectral properties and its chromatographic behavior. No other tests were carried out because we were working with marigold oleoresin, in which lutein represents about 80 % of the pigment content.|$|R
40|$|Biology {{implements}} {{fundamental principles}} {{that allow for}} attractive mechanical properties, as observed in biomineralized structures. For example, diatom algae contain nanoporous hierarchical silicified shells that provide mechanical defense from predators and virus penetration. These shells generally have a morphology resembling honeycombs within honeycombs, meshes, or corrugated folds, and are surprisingly tough when compared to bulk silica, {{which is one of}} the most brittle materials known. However, the reason for the enhanced mechanical properties has remained elusive. Here, it is proposed that one reason for the superior mechanical properties lies in the geometric arrangement, size, and shape of the structures. By carrying out a series of molecular dynamics simulations with the first principles based reactive force field ReaxFF, it is shown that when concurrent mechanisms occur, such as shearing and crack arrest, toughness is optimally enhanced. This occurs, for example, when structures encompass two nanoscale levels of hierarchy: an array of thin walled foil silica structures, and a hierarchical arrangement of foil elements into a porous silica mesh structure. For wavy silica, unfolding mechanisms are achieved for increasing amplitude, and allow for greater ductility. Furthermore, these deformation mechanisms are governed by the size and shape of the structure. The ability to transform multiple mechanical properties, such as toughness, strength, and ductility, is extremely important when looking into future applications of nanoscale materials. Altering the mechanical properties of one of the most brittle and abundant minerals on <b>earth,</b> <b>silica,</b> allows a new window of opportunity for humanity to create applications and reinvent materials once thought to be impossible. The transferability of the concept allowing for massive transformation of mechanical responses, such as brittle to ductile or weak to tough, through geometric alterations at the nanoscale, is a profound discovery that may unleash a new paradigm in the way materials are designed. by Andre Phillipe Garcia.

The suitability of the supports and techniques for the immobilization of lipase was evaluated by estimating the enzyme activity, protein loading, immobilization efficiency and reusability of the immobilizates. Most of the immobilizates exhibited either a low enzyme activity or difficulties during the hydrolytic reaction. Only those prepared by ionic adsorption on Amberlite IRC- 50 and by combined adsorption and precipitation on Al 2 O 3 showed better activity, 2000 and 430 U/g support, respectively, and demonstrated satisfactory behavior when used repeatedly. The hydrolysis was studied as a function of several parameters: surfactant concentration, enzyme concentration, pH and temperature. The immobilized preparation with Amberlite IRC- 50 was stable and active in the whole range of pH (4 to 9) and temperature (20 to 50 °C), demonstrating a 99 % degree of hydrolysis. In repeated usage, it was stable and active having a half-life of 16 batches, which corresponds to an operation time of 384 h.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate phase transitions and chemical reactions of selected materials under high pressure and high temperature using First-Principles electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This thesis is composed of three projects: (i) the design of new strategies for the synthesis of energetic materials based on fully extended CO 2 (X-CO 2) or CO (X-CO) solids at pressures amenable to industrial production, (ii) the investigation of novel chemical reactions of <b>silica</b> under <b>Earth’s</b> mantle conditions, and (iii) the study of melting, nuclear quantum effects, and pressure-induced amorphization phenomena of ice Ih. Extended X-CO 2 with fully sp 3 hybridized C and O atoms is a highly energetic material that can be synthesized at 41 GPa and 1800 K. The product obtained at high pressure was shown to be recoverable at ambient pressure using metadynamics. To alleviate the stringent synthetic conditions, new strategies including the addition of catalysts (H 2 and O 2) to solid CO 2 and CO and photochemical activation were proposed and investigated by performing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations. The addition of H 2 or O 2 was shown to successfully lower the formation pressure and produced different forms of polymeric X-CO 2 /X-CO. The X-CO 2 /X-CO obtained from H 2 activated polymerization of solid CO 2 and CO can be quench-recovered with estimated energy densities of 12. 60 kJ/g and 11. 50 kJ/g for CO 2 +H 2 and CO+H 2, respectively. Photo-excitation {{was found to be}} the most efficient method that can lower the formation pressure for the polymerization of CO 2 solid to 15 GPa and 1200 K. The photochemical reaction produced a dense form of X-CO 2 consisting mainly of sp 3 C and O atoms with an estimated energy density of 8. 63 kJ/g. Chemical reactions between different silica with CO 2 and H 2 at high pressure and high temperature were investigated using AIMD. Crystalline and amorphous forms with the different stoichiometry SiO 2 -CO 2 were found from the reactions between CO 2 with SiO 2 zeolite and stishovite. In MD calculations using the reactive force field on a large SiO 2 /H 2 model system, H 2 was also found to react with quartz under moderate pressure and temperature. This chemical process produced a denser liquid water confined in the SiO 2 /Si-H layers. The structural evolution of pressure-induced amorphized (PIA) ice Ih was investigated by classical MD using the four-site TIP 4 P/ice water potential and AIMD calculations with non-local van der Waals-corrected exchange-correlation functional. The amorphization was revealed to be a multiple step process with an intermediate crystalline phase prior to amorphization. The existence of the intermediate crystalline structure is due to a shear instability. The results suggest that the PIA at low temperature is primarily governed by kinetics. An ab initio-based flexible and polarizable Thole-type TTM 2. 1 -F water model was examined for the simulation of water properties with and without nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) by classical molecular dynamics and path integral molecular dynamics. The NQEs were shown to weaken the hydrogen bonds bringing the theoretical structure to a better agreement with experiment. NQEs also contributed to a decrease of 20 K in the melting temperature of ice of the TTM 2. 1 -F water model...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: One {{focus in}} recent {{atmospheric}} pollution &# 13; research is on fine Particle Matter (PM), especially as result of increasing traffic &# 13; and anthropogenic activity in urban areas. Here, {{the impact on}} animal and human &# 13; health {{has been in the}} center of many studies. Despite the fact that PM depositions &# 13; can affect plants on the long term, there are only few studies about the impact &# 13; on plants conducted. Approach: Therefore we studied the impact &# 13; of PM on plants, using naturally occurring <b>silica</b> dusts (diatomaceous <b>earth)</b> and &# 13; hard Coal Fly Ash (CFA) from burning processes. Dusts were applied onto Brassica &# 13; chinensis L. using a simple duster (covering upper leaf surfaces) or electrostatically &# 13; (covering leaf upper and -underside). Results: Main components &# 13; of the tested CFA are SO 4 2 -, K, Ca and NH 4 +. The pH value of eluates was found &# 13; to be around 9. 5 in CFA and 5. 7 in silica. B. chinensis was insensitive towards &# 13; the high pH and showed no growth reduction when grown in silica or CFA substrate. &# 13; PM deposition on leaf surfaces results through shading in a reduced photosynthetic &# 13; activity. The reduction is relatively higher at higher light intensities. Photosynthesis &# 13; stays reduced after removal of silica PM from leaf surfaces. We assume that stomata &# 13; get cloaked by small particles and that silica absorbs lipids from the epicuticle &# 13; resulting in a general stress reaction. Smaller sized silica particles resulted &# 13; in a higher reduction of CO 2 -absorption. Next to particle size is the photosynthesis &# 13; negatively correlated with exposure time for silica PM. The chlorophyll fluorescence &# 13; data indicate that dust-covered leaves exhibited significantly lower quantum yield &# 13; of PS II and a reduced quantum efficiency of PS II and therefore supported the &# 13; gas exchange data. Conclusion: Reduced photosynthetic performance &# 13; would be expected to reduce growth and productivity of B. chinensis. In contrast &# 13; to silica hard coal fly ash showed only a reduction of photosynthesis through &# 13; shading but did not have any long time effects after washing them off...|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{addresses}} the synthesis and characterization of porous carbon substrates, and their electrochemical and fuel cell evaluation. The approach involves using porous carbon materials of different pore characteristics as electrocatalyst materials for use as cathode catalyst substrates in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). In this work, a porous carbon, known as carbonaceous Celatom or C-Celatom, was prepared by template synthesis using a widely abundant, inexpensive macroporous <b>silica</b> structure diatomaceous <b>earth</b> (Celatom FW- 80). Ordered mesoporous carbon CMK- 3 was also produced by template synthesis of mesoporous silica SBA- 15. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to confirm the synthesis of the desired carbon structures. Three different platinum deposition techniques were investigated for electrocatalyst synthesis, an incipient wetness technique, as ethylene glycol reduction technique, and an alkoxide reduction technique. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and SEM analysis of the catalysts formed using the incipient wetness and ethylene glycol techniques showed that the synthesized catalysts were not suitable for fuel cell use. Optimization of the alkoxide reduction technique resulted in a deposition technique {{that resulted in a}} well-dispersed catalyst with small, uniform particle sizes (2. 1 - 3. 1 nm). The synthesized electrocatalysts were evaluated electrochemically and found to have high electrochemically active surface areas (ESA) of 33. 38 m 2 g- 1 for Pt/Vulcan XC- 72, 22. 45 m 2 g- 1 for Pt/CMK- 3 and 20. 51 m 2 g- 1 for Pt/C-Celatom. The oxygen reduction (ORR) activity was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry(LSV). The Pt/C-Celatom exhibited the greatest activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction, and the greatest number of active sites for the ORR. Assessment of the material by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) also showed that an MEA with C-Celatom as the cathode catalyst has the lowest combines charge transfer and mass transport resistance. Single cell DMFC testing was carried out with each of the experimental substrates. The synthesized catalysts demonstrated high performance over a range of temperatures and feed molarity concentrations. The C-Celatom MEA exhibited the greatest power output of the synthesized catalysts for low molarity operation, with peak power densities of 25. 8 and 32. 6 mW cm- 2 with 0. 5 M and 1 M feed respectively.

40|$|The blue {{amphibole}} asbestos, crocidolite, {{which occurs}} as interbedded seams in banded ironstones of the Lower Griquatown {{stage of the}} Transvaal System in the Northern Cape Province, is the finely fibrous form of the soda-amphibole riebeckite. Despite the widespread occurrence of the Precambrian type of banded ironstones, crocidolite is a mineral of rare occurrence and is only developed to a relatively minor extent in South Africa, Western Australia and Central China. The composition, structure and properties of riebeckite {{in general and of}} crocidolite in particular are discussed and four new chemical analyses are given. Particular attention is paid to the mode of occurrence of fibrous riebeckite and it is suggested that the name "crocidolite" be reserved for the asbestiform riebeckite which occurs interbedded with banded ironstones. The general geology, lithology and mineralogy of Precambrian banded ironstones are described and their distribution in space and time is discussed. It is found that no banded ironstones are known to be younger than 1000 million years. This fact is related to special conditions of atmosphere, surface temperature and biological development which existed during the so-called Primitive Period of the Precambrian, a period which lasted from approximately 3000 million years to 1000 million years ago. The banded ironstones of the Transvaal System are described in some detail and seven new chemical analyses as well as trace element data are given. The genesis of banded ironstones is discussed at some length and particular attention is paid to the authigenesis of riebeckite. It is concluded that banded ironstones were deposited in seasonally fluctuating, typically "non-aggressive", fresh to brackish water lakes which were fed by sluggish, mature rivers. The solutions of iron and <b>silica,</b> alkaline <b>earths</b> and clay colloids carried by these rivers were derived from basic igneous rocks by chemical weathering in a tropical, monsoon-type climate. Recognisable detrital material is virtually absent from the banded ironstones of the Transvaal System, but it is thought that the stilpnomelane layers are aeolian deposits and that their composition gives some indication of the material which remained behind as "lateritic" soils in the source area. It is suggested that both crocidolite and riebeckite were formed by the low temperature dehydration, in situ, of an ordered precursor which could have been a clay mineral similar in structure to attapulgite, but containing ferrous and ferric ions in the octahedral layer. This clay mineral acquired sodium by cation exchange during dry periods when the depositional lakes were enriched in sodium. It is found that the actual formation of crocidolite is completely unrelated to dynamic stress. It formed only where layers of proto-riebeckite were in close contact or traversed by magnetite layers. It grew by the diffusion of proto-riebeckite through the magnetite layers, its transformation to riebeckite during its passage, and final addition to fibre growth points in contact with the magnetite layer. This process was initiated by slight temperature gradients in the magnetite layers and was propagated by a type of thermal autocatalysis. The temperature gradients in the magnetite layers resulted from their superior heat conductivity combined with differences in depth of burial of the strata. Economic deposits of crocidolite formed where a sufficient number of layers of protoriebeckite were in contact with magnetite layers which maintained or repeatedly attained the requisite temperature levels. The superimposed economic deposits of the Kuruman area, which appear to be related to folding, are due to an early period of folding, possibly even slumping during deposition, which took place prior to the formation of crocidolite and caused the thickening of the protoriebeckite layers in the crests and troughs of folds by plastic flow from the flanks. Three appendices, giving details of chemical and spectrographic analyses and of chemical experiments carried out, are attached...|$|R
40|$|During {{the three}} years of this project, Professor Dove's {{laboratory}} made tremendous progress in understanding controls on amorphous silica dissolution kinetics in aqueous solutions. Our findings have already received considerable attention. In hydrothermal and low temperature studies, the work focused on determining quantitative and mechanistic controls on the most abundant <b>silica</b> polymorphs in <b>Earth</b> environments [...] quartz and amorphous silica. Our studies achieved goals {{set forth in the}} original proposal to establish a new quantitative understanding of amorphous silica dissolution. This support has resulted in 10 journal, 12 abstracts and 2 thesis publications. The PI and students were also recognized with 6 awards during this period. The 1998 EMSP conference in Chicago was an important meeting for our project. The symposium, enabled P. I. Dove to establish valuable contacts with ''users'' having specific needs for the findings of our EMSP project related to the urgency of problems in the Tanks Focus Area (TFA). Since that time, our working relations developed as Dove interacted with TFA scientists and engineers on the problems of waste glass properties. These interactions refined our experimental objectives to better meet their needs. Dove presented the results of EMSP research findings to a TFA subgroup at a Product Acceptance Workshop held in Salt Lake City during December 1998. The travel costs to attend this unanticipated opportunity were paid from EMSP project funds. In January 2000, Dove also attended a similar meeting in Atlanta with PNNL, SRL and BNF scientists/engineers to discuss new issues and make another level of decisions on the Product Acceptance goals. Our EMSP-funded research interfaced very well with the ongoing studies of Dr. Pete McGrail and colleagues in the Applied Geochemistry Group at PNNL. The value of our work to ''users'' was further demonstrated when Dove's EMSP-funded Postdoc, Dr. Jonathan Icenhower was hired by the same PNNL group. With the Icenhower move from postdoc in the Dove lab to a senior scientist position at PNNL, we directly facilitated information transfer from the ''university to user'' environment. Icenhower brought experience in silica-water reactivity and the experimental expertise in high-quality methods of mineral-water reaction kinetics to the PNNL waste clean-up effort. In a further interaction, M. S. student Troy Lorier was hired at the Savannah River Laboratory for a staff position with the Bill Holtzcheiter glass group. His research meshed well with on-going efforts at SRL. In short, our EMSP project went well beyond the academic goals of producing high quality scientific knowledge to establish connections with on-site users to solve problems in TFA. This project also produced new talent for the waste immobilization effort. This EMSP project was highly successful and we thank our sponsors for the opportunity to advance scientific knowledge in this important area of research...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{materials}} are now well established as key {{contributors to the}} technological advances of the past century. Without the optical transparency of silica glass, the ability to generate and manipulate light in semiconductors, crystals and glass, or create planar optical waveguides in analogy with advances in microelectronics, the speed and complexity of modern telecommunications networks {{could not have been}} realized. The earth is now covered in optical fibre, hair thin threads of silica glass, carrying light pulses at speeds now approaching 40 Gigabits per second. It is estimated that hundreds of millions of kilometers of fibre has been laid under the sea and buried in the <b>earth.</b> <b>Silica</b> may be the ultimate optical material, however, for the most part its very inertness and stability, the properties that make it an ideal passive waveguide, limits its active applications. In general, the active characteristics of glass, its acousto-optic, magneto-optic and electro-optic properties, are weak. In addition, the ability to optically switch light, through non-linear effects, or to amplify light directly in a fibre, are for the most part difficult. Nature has been kind in providing an amplification scheme in which rare <b>earth</b> doped <b>silica</b> glass provides gain and amplification around the key telecommunications window at 1. 55 microns, the wavelength at which fibre loss is a minimum. The erbium doped fibre amplifier however is an {{exception rather than the rule}} and increasing data traffic is demanding optical amplifiers at other wavelengths emerging for use in telecommunications. To amplify light at wavelengths outside the current standard of 1. 55 microns, for example around 1. 3 microns, another widely used transmission window in telecom fibre, or at wavelengths near 1. 4 and 1. 6 microns, silica glass fibre is not practical. While optical amplification at 1. 55 microns enjoys efficiencies of almost 100 %, other dopants and amplification schemes in silica glass fibre are problematic. To actively manipulate light, to amplify and to develop all-optical networks, we must turn to new optical materials. The contributions to this section begin a series of articles that will provide an overall review of the role of optical materials in today's technology, and provide a glimpse into the future of where these advances will lead. We begin in this issue with four contributions to the field, which cover diverse applications, but with a common theme, the active manipulation, and application of light. The key technology enabling the rapid increase in capacity and speed in today's optical networks is wavelength division multiplexing. A series of discrete wavelengths, each carrying individual data streams are combined and transmitted through a single fibre. Each wavelength however requires amplification and here new optical fibre {{materials are}} being developed for this application. In his review paper, optical fibre materials, Sugimoto describes new glass technologies that are providing more efficient amplification at new wavelengths, as well as broadening and flattening the bandwidth of the 1. 55 micron amplifier. Glasses based on heavy metal oxides, phosphates are considered, and the spectroscopy of new dopants to provide the gain medium required are discussed. With the optical fibre amplifier replacing the bottleneck of electronic amplification and providing uninterrupted flow of light through a system, interest has been spurred in the area of all optical switching. The refractive index of a fibre varies nonlinearly with the intensity of incident light through a variety of electromagnetic phenomenon. Jha et al. reviews several important examples of nonlinear optical effects, the techniques used to characterize them, and the application of optical nonlinearity. In addition, the emerging fields of surface plasmon effects, microstructured fibre and photonic band gap structures and their applications are introduced. Turning to organic materials, two papers look at emerging applications of the next generation of polymer materials. Curry and Gillin discuss recent advances of light emitting diodes based on organic polymers. In analogy with rare earth doped glass, key results are being obtained through the application of organolanthanide molecules which provide visible and infrared emission with high efficiencies. Advances in the field are leading to a clearer understanding of the mechanisms which quench radiative emission and reduce efficiency. Clearly polymers, with their low cost and relatively simple manufacturing methods easily scaled to mass production, hold considerable promise. Yager and Barrett describe the exploitation of an unexpected property of polymers containing optical chromophores. Thin films of these materials respond mechanically to low power light, resulting in a transfer of an arbitrary optical pattern to the surface of the film, in a reversible process. They describe a number of proposed mechanisms for this effect, a topic that is under intense study. The ability to directly alter thin films in this way has attracted much interest for practical applications. Optical elements such as polarizers, couplers, filters have been produced. The reversible nature of the process has been exploited in the gratings used to tune laser emission wavelengths. As a direct patterning technique, features on a nanometer scale can be achieved. In these four publications we see emerging themes and connections between the technologies being developed. New optical materials are required for the next generation of optoelectronic devices while a better understanding of the chemistry and physics of these materials is critical to fully exploit the technology...|$|R
