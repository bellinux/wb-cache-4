Facilitative skills are increasingly becoming a core competency for leaders, consultants, and others who work with groups. It 2 ̆ 7 s not just for facilitators anymore...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{and discusses}} {{the design of}} a client-server system from a security point of view. The main topics are authentication and data security which can be divided into secure transfer and secure storage. Authentication is the act where the server and the user prove their knowledge of a shared secret to each other. The shared secret can be of three different types, <b>something</b> <b>you</b> know, <b>something</b> <b>you</b> have or <b>something</b> <b>you</b> are. When talking about a software system a combination of <b>something</b> <b>you</b> know and <b>something</b> <b>you</b> have, for example a password and a hardware token, is the best choice for a system where high security is important. To be able to authenticate without revealing the secret to the other party or any external party an algorithm that uses techniques from public key cryptography and have a similar design as a Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is used. Data security is dependent on mainly two properties, confidentiality and integrity, and if both of them can be guaranteed the data is considered secure. Confidentiality is provided by symmetric key encryption and integrity is provided by either a message digest or a MAC...|$|R
