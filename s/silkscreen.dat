5|$|Pop artist Andy Warhol {{painted a}} series of <b>silkscreen</b> portraits of Jagger in 1975, {{one of which was}} owned by Farah Diba, wife of the Shah of Iran. It hung on a wall inside the royal palace in Tehran. In 1967 Cecil Beaton photographed Jagger's naked buttocks, a photo that sold at Sotheby's auction house in 1986 for $4,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Warhol began {{producing}} {{his first}} canvases, which he based on comic strip subjects. In late 1961, {{he learned the}} process of silkscreening from Floriano Vecchi, who had run the Tiber Press since 1953. Though the process generally begins with a stencil drawing, it often evolves from a blown up photograph which is then transferred with glue onto silk. In either case, one needs to produce a glue-based version of a positive two-dimensional image (positive means that open spaces are left where the paint will appear). Usually, the ink is rolled across the medium so that it passes through the silk and not the glue. Campbell's Soup cans were among Warhol's first <b>silkscreen</b> productions; the first were U.S. dollar bills. The pieces were made from stencils; one for each color. Warhol did not begin to convert photographs to silkscreens until after the original series of Campbell's Soup cans had been produced.|$|E
5|$|Depp {{collaborated with}} costume {{designer}} Penny Rose on his character's appearance, handpicking a tricorne as Sparrow's signature leather hat; to make Sparrow's unique, {{the other characters}} did not wear leather hats. A rubber version {{was used for the}} scene in Dead Man's Chest when the hat floats on water. Depp liked to stick to one costume, wearing one lightweight silk tweed frock coat throughout the series, and he had to be coaxed out of wearing his boots for a version without a sole or heel in beach scenes. The official line is that none of the costumes from The Curse of the Black Pearl survived, which allowed the opportunity to create tougher linen shirts for stunts. However, one remains which has been displayed in an exhibition of screen costumes in Worcester, England. It was a nightmare for Rose to track down the same makers of Sparrow's sash in Turkey. Rose did not want to <b>silkscreen</b> it, as the homewoven piece had the correct worn feel. Sparrow wears an additional belt in the sequels, because Depp liked a new buckle which did not fit with the original piece.|$|E

25|$|By 1962, Rauschenberg's {{paintings}} {{were beginning to}} incorporate not only found objects but found images as well - photographs transferred to the canvas {{by means of the}} <b>silkscreen</b> process. Previously used only in commercial applications, <b>silkscreen</b> allowed Rauschenberg to address the multiple reproducibility of images, and the consequent flattening of experience that implies. In this respect, his work is contemporaneous with that of Andy Warhol, and both Rauschenberg and Johns are frequently cited as important forerunners of American Pop Art.|$|E

The piece (<b>silkscreen</b> ink and spray paint on canvas) shows Elvis Presley in a gunslinger pose. It was first exhibited in 1963 at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. Warhol made 22 versions of the Double Elvis, nine of which are held in museums.|$|E

50|$|In 1962, artist Andy Warhol {{took the}} {{familiar}} {{look of the}} Campbell's soup can and integrated it {{into a series of}} pop art <b>silkscreens,</b> a theme he would return to off and on through the 1960s and 1970s. The first batch in 1962 were a series of 32 canvases. At first, the cans were accurate representations of actual Campbell's cans, but as his series progressed, they became more surrealistic, with Warhol experimenting with negative-reversed color schemes and other varied techniques (many of these which would be used on other Warhol paintings of the period, such as his celebrity <b>silkscreens</b> of the 1960s). The <b>silkscreens</b> themselves have become iconic pieces of pop art, with one in particular, Small Torn Campbell Soup Can (Pepper Pot) (1962), commanding a price of $11.8 million at auction in 2006.|$|R

25|$|The first {{official}} {{activity of the}} organization was an inaugural batik and <b>silkscreen</b> workshop that ended with a group exhibition. Participating artists paid a small fee and provided their own materials. Thus began the Self Help tradition of instructing budding artists in graphic arts techniques. Shortly thereafter, funds provided by the California Arts Council allowed the hiring of artists Peter Tovar, Fernando Amozorrutia,Carlos Bueno,Victor Du Bois,Jeff Gates,Linda Orozco, Jesse Rays, Carla Wbeber,Silvia Chavez,Michael Amescua and Linda Vallejo as arts instructors. It {{should be noted that}} the first Day of the Dead Celebration in the USA began in 1974 at SHG.|$|E
25|$|In 1938–40, American painter John Steuart Curry painted Tragic Prelude (left), a {{mural of}} Brown {{holding a gun}} and a Bible, in the Kansas State Capitol in Topeka. In 1941, Jacob Lawrence {{illustrated}} Brown's life in The Legend of John Brown, a series of 22 gouache paintings. By 1977, these were in such fragile condition {{that they could not}} be displayed, and the Detroit Institute of Arts had to commission Lawrence to recreate the series as <b>silkscreen</b> prints. The result was a limited-edition portfolio of 22 hand-screened prints, published with a poem, John Brown by Robert Hayden, commissioned specifically for the project. Though Brown had been a popular topic for many painters, The Legend of John Brown was the first series to explore his legacy from an African American perspective. Paintings such as Hovenden's The Last Moments of John Brown immortalize an apocryphal story, in which a Black woman offers the condemned Brown her baby to kiss {{on his way to the}} gallows. It was probably a tale invented by journalist James Redpath.|$|E

25|$|From 1970 {{he worked}} {{from his home}} and studio in Captiva, Florida. His first project on Captiva Island was a 16.5-meter-long <b>silkscreen</b> print called Currents (1970), made with {{newspapers}} from {{the first two months}} of the year, followed by Cardboards (1970–71) and Early Egyptians (1973–74), the latter of which is a series of wall reliefs and sculptures constructed from used boxes. He also printed on textiles using his solvent-transfer technique to make the Hoarfrosts (1974–76) and Spreads (1975–82), and in the Jammers (1975–76), created a series of colorful silk wall and floor works. Urban Bourbons (1988–95) focused on different methods of transferring images onto a variety of reflective metals, such as steel and aluminum. In addition, throughout the 1990s, Rauschenberg continued to utilize new materials while still working with more rudimentary techniques, such as wet fresco, as in the Arcadian Retreat (1996) series, and the transfer of images by hand, as in the Anagrams (1995–2000). As part of his engagement with the latest technological innovations, he began making digital Iris prints and using biodegradable vegetable dyes in his transfer processes, underscoring his commitment to caring for the environment.|$|E
500|$|Born in Australia, Munro grew up {{mostly in}} Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, {{and moved to}} nearby Toronto to study at OCAD University, graduating in 2000. Influenced by such artists as General Idea and the queercore movement, he {{received}} critical attention for his work with men's underwear, a medium he used eventually to create collages of colourful performers he admired such as Klaus Nomi and Leigh Bowery. He created <b>silkscreen</b> posters to advertise Vazaleen—his monthly nightclub party that was unusual for being a queer event where punk and other rock music was prominently played, and for {{being one of the}} first to exist beyond the confines of the gay ghetto. The party was known for attracting a diverse crowd, and at its peak brought in such performers as Nina Hagen; international [...] "best-of" [...] nightclub lists took notice.|$|E

Vig oversaw the liner notes and thanks list for the album: [...] "It's been a burden because we're encompassing what we've done over the last 10 years in one short paragraph"; music journalist Peter Murphy composed a biography on the band's history for the booklet, while the album artwork was designed by Tom Hingston Studio—a foil blocked <b>silkscreen</b> image photographed by David Hughes. The booklet also compiled a number of promotional photographs of the group taken over the course of their career by Stéphane Sednaoui, Ellen von Unwerth, Rankin, Pat Pope, Warwick Saint, and Joseph Cultice.|$|E
