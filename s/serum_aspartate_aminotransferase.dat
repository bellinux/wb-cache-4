40|$|AbstractFipronil (FPN) is a broad-spectrum N-phenylpyrazole {{insecticide}} and {{has been}} used in agriculture and public health since the mid- 1990 s. The present study was designed to investigate the adverse effects of sub-chronic exposure to the FPN on the liver and kidney of male rats at three concentrations 0. 1, 1 and 10 mg/L in drinking water for 45 days. <b>Serum</b> <b>aspartate</b> <b>aminotransferases</b> (AST), alanine aminotransferases (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and levels of uric acid, creatinine and total protein were significantly increased in FPN-treated rats. Oxidative stress biomarkers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reduced (GSH) were significantly decreased, while lipid peroxidation (LPO) was significantly increased in treating rats in a concentration dependent manner. FPN caused histopathological alterations in liver and kidney of male rats. From our results, it can be concluded that FPN induced lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, liver, and kidney injury in rats. These pathophysiological changes in liver and kidney tissues could be due to the toxic effect of FPN that associated with a generation of free radicals...|$|R

Eighteen patients with colorectal, duodenal, and oesophageal tumours were studied. After 30 - 60 mg/kg of ALA given orally, biopsy specimens of tumour and adjacent normal mucosa were taken 1 - 72 hours later. These specimens were examined by quantitative fluorescence microscopy for assessment of sensitisation with protoporphyrin IX. Ten patients were given a second dose of ALA {{a few weeks later}} and their tumours were treated with red laser light (628 nm). With 30 mg/kg ALA, the highest fluorescence values were detected in the duodenum and oesophagus, and the lowest in the large bowel. Doubling the ALA dose in patients with colorectal tumours gave protoporphyrin IX fluorescence intensities similar to those in patients with upper gastrointestinal lesions and improved the tumour:normal mucosa protoporphyrin IX sensitisation ratio.
