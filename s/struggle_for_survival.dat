5|$|The biogeographical {{patterns}} Charles Darwin {{observed in}} places such as the Galápagos Islands during the second voyage of HMS Beagle caused him to doubt the fixity of species, and in 1837 Darwin started {{the first of a series}} of secret notebooks on transmutation. Darwin's observations led him to view transmutation as a process of divergence and branching, rather than the ladder-like progression envisioned by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and others. In 1838 he read the new 6th edition of An Essay on the Principle of Population, written in the late 18th century by Thomas Robert Malthus. Malthus' idea of population growth leading to a <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> <b>survival</b> combined with Darwin's knowledge on how breeders selected traits, led to the inception of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin did not publish his ideas on evolution for 20 years. However, he did share them with certain other naturalists and friends, starting with Joseph Dalton Hooker, with whom he discussed his unpublished 1844 essay on natural selection. During this period he used the time he could spare from his other scientific work to slowly refine his ideas and, aware of the intense controversy around transmutation, amass evidence to support them. In September 1854 he began full-time work on writing his book on natural selection.|$|E

25|$|The {{same was}} {{generally}} true of other electric folk outfits. The late 1970s and early 1980s were {{a time to}} either abandon the genre or fight a losing <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> <b>survival.</b> The reason is often said to be punk rock, which reached a peak in 1976-7. It changed the ethos of popular music, overturning certainties about musicianship and songwriting and had no greater target than the old fashioned folk musicians of the preceding generation. All popular music trends have a generational problem as their audiences grow and might not be replaced, but for folk rock the discontinuity was very acute. One result was a further hybridisation {{with the development of}} folk punk among younger acts in the later 1970s, some of which, like the Pogues and The Levellers, achieved some mainstream success. The early 1980s were the nadir of electric folk, when, in contrast to the mid-1970s only the Albion Band (with the associated Home Service) and the Oysterband remained as major exponents of the genre and this was perhaps their least productive period.|$|E
500|$|Charles Darwin {{considered}} that conscience evolved in humans to resolve conflicts between competing natural impulses-some about self-preservation but others about {{safety of a}} family or community; the claim of conscience to moral authority emerged from the [...] "greater duration of impression of social instincts" [...] in the <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> <b>survival.</b> In such a view, behavior destructive to a person's society (either to its structures or to the persons it comprises) is bad or [...] "evil". Thus, conscience {{can be viewed as}} an outcome of those biological drives that prompt humans to avoid provoking fear or contempt in others; being experienced as guilt and shame in differing ways from society to society and person to person. A requirement of conscience in this view is the capacity to see ourselves {{from the point of view}} of another person. Persons unable to do this (psychopaths, sociopaths, narcissists) therefore often act in ways which are [...] "evil".|$|E

500|$|This logical {{structure}} {{can be seen}} as a prototype for the organisation of On the Origin of Species, presenting the detail of various aspects of the problem, then setting out a theory explaining the phenomena, followed by a demonstration of the wider explanatory power of the theory. Unlike the Origin which was hurriedly put together as an abstract of his planned [...] "big book", Coral Reefs is fully supported by citations and material gathered together in the Appendix. Coral Reefs is arguably the first volume of Darwin's huge treatise on his philosophy of nature, like his succeeding works showing how slow gradual change can account for the history of life. In presenting types of reef as an evolutionary series it demonstrated a rigorous methodology for historical sciences, interpreting patterns visible in the present as the results of history. In one passage he presents a particularly Malthusian view of a <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> <b>survival</b> – [...] "In an old-standing reef, the corals, which are so different in kind on different parts of it, are probably all adapted to the stations they occupy, and hold their places, like other organic beings, by a struggle one with another, and with external nature; hence we may infer that their growth would generally be slow, except under peculiarly favourable circumstances." ...|$|E
500|$|Starship Troopers {{has been}} {{identified}} as being a part of a tradition in U.S. science fiction that assumes that violent conflict and the militarization of society is inevitable and necessary. Although the Mobile Infantry, the unit to which Rico is assigned, is seen as a lowly post by the characters in the story, the novel itself suggests that it {{is the heart of the}} army and the most honorable unit in it. In a commentary written in 1980, Heinlein agreed that Starship Troopers [...] "glorifies the military ... Specifically the P.B.I., the Poor Bloody Infantry, the mudfoot who places his frail body between his loved home and the war's desolation – but is rarely appreciated... he has the toughest job of all and should be honored." [...] The story is based on the social Darwinist idea of society as a <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> <b>survival</b> based on military strength. It suggests that some conflicts must be resolved by force: one of the lessons Rico is repeatedly taught is that violence can be an effective method of settling conflict. These suggestions derive in part from Heinlein's view that in the 1950s the U.S. government was being too conciliatory in its dealings with communist China and the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|Hwang {{was given}} a free hand with dialogue; he {{was not allowed to}} change lyrics. [...] Hwang was inexperienced at writing musicals, and the {{producers}} hired veteran Robert Longbottom to direct the production and collaborate on the new script, [...] "really a new musical which has a pre-existing score." [...] Only the character names, the San Francisco Chinatown setting and some of the relationships were retained, but the pair sought to be faithful to the spirit of both Lee's novel and the musical's original concept of old-world and older generation values struggling with new-world temptations and the desires of the younger generation. [...] This concept is reflected in the <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> <b>survival</b> of Wang's Chinese opera company, as it competes with the more modern, Americanized night club run by Ta. [...] The role of Mei-li (as spelled in the revision) was expanded. [...] The character of Madam Liang was changed [...] "from the wise-owl aunt" [...] to a [...] "savvy career woman" [...] in show business. [...] Chinatown is portrayed as a more gritty and difficult place for new immigrants, and the pursuit of material success is given a more cynical face, especially in Act II. [...] The song [...] "The Other Generation" [...] was deleted; [...] "My Best Love", which had been cut in tryouts in 1958, was restored in its place, and [...] "The Next Time It Happens" [...] was imported from Pipe Dream. [...] New orchestrations were by Don Sebesky and music director David Chase. [...] According to The New York Times, Hwang [...] "has reshaped the story to elucidate two of his own abiding thematic interests: the idea of the theater as a prism for society and the generational clashes of diversely assimilated immigrants." ...|$|E
