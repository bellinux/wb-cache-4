40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current {{study was to examine the}} {{mediating}} role of <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills in explaining the relationship between early aggression and later behavior problems. Additionally, the moderational role of <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills was also examined. The criteria proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) and Holmbeck (1997) were followed to test the mediational and the moderational models. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between early aggression and <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills, <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills and later behavior problems, and early aggression and later behavior problems. Results indicated that <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills do not mediate the relationship between early aggression and later behavior <b>problems.</b> However, <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills do moderate this relationship. Further, it was the number of categories generated as opposed to the number of solutions that was the better predictor. The clinical and theoretical implications of these finding...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrative}} {{model in}} which perfectionism and <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving were hypothesized to have additive and interactive effects in predicting psychological maladjustment (viz., depressive symptoms and suicide ideation) was proposed and tested {{in a sample of}} 371 college students.

Moreover, a significant Perfectionism × <b>Social</b> <b>Problem</b> Solving interaction was found in predicting each of the maladjustment measures after accounting for the influences of both perfectionism and <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving. These results are taken to provide preliminary support for an additive and interactive prediction model of psychological maladjustment involving perfectionism and <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving...|$|R

40|$|Poor autobiographical memory {{abilities}} in young, depressed adults {{have been found}} to be related to poorer <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving ability, supposedly the result of working memory deficits. These relationships were examined in 80 healthy older and younger adults. It was hypothesized that age-related cognitive declines and decreased autobiographical specificity would predict poorer <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving ability. Furthermore, increasing memory support by priming autobiographical memory before a <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving task was predicted to improve problem solving performance to a greater degree for the older group. Subsequent to three cognitive tests, participants' specific memories were tested using a cued recall task, followed by a <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving task. Each age group was tested by two different experimenters. The order of the cued recall task was varied to determine whether primed autobiographical memories improved problem solving performance. Autobiographical specificity predicted <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving ability for both age groups. In addition, experimenter effects predicted autobiographical memory specificity. Age related cognitive declines were present but did not predict autobiographical memory specificity or <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving ability.

40|$|The {{current study}} aimed {{to examine the}} {{contribution}} of neurocognition and social cognition to components of <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving. Sixty-seven inpatients with schizophrenia and 31 healthy controls were administrated batteries of neurocognitive tests, emotion perception tests, and the Chinese Assessment of Interpersonal Problem Solving Skills (CAIPSS). MANOVAs were conducted to investigate the domains in which patients with schizophrenia showed impairments. Correlations {{were used to determine}} which impaired domains were associated with <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving, and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare the relative contribution of neurocognitive and social cognitive functioning to components of <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving. Compared with healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse in sustained attention, working memory, negative emotion, intention identification and all components of the CAIPSS. Specifically, sustained attention, working memory and negative emotion identification were found to correlate with <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving and 1 -back accuracy significantly predicted the poor performance in <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving. Among the dysfunctions in schizophrenia, working memory contributed most to deficits in <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving in patients with schizophrenia.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} medical students' <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving and coping skills. Material and Methods: In this correlational descriptive study, data were gathered from 457 medical students. <b>Social</b> <b>Problem</b> Solving Inventory and <b>Social</b> <b>Problem</b> Coping Behaviours Inventory were used. Results: The most preferred activities when the students face a problem were talking with friends (87. 1 %), talking with special persons (85. 4 %), sleeping (82. 6 %), talking with family members (81. 6 %), and eating (79. 8 %). The ratio of the behaviors that can be deemed risky were exhibiting aggressive and violent behaviors (18. 9 %), drinking alcohol (18. 7 %), smoking (17. 6 %), playing games of chance (16. 9 %), and using substance (3. 8 %). There was a positive relationship between total scores of <b>Social</b> <b>Problem</b> Solving Inventory and <b>Social</b> <b>Problem</b> Coping Behaviours Inventory. It is found that immature <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving ability has increased the risk of unfavourable behaviours by 3. 1 fold. Conclusion: <b>Social</b> <b>problem</b> solving ability is significantly correlated with coping behaviours and may predict it. Medical students who are the doctors and the role models of the future need to develop their <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills in addition to clinical problem solving skills.

When describing the character's personality, Arakawa comments that after his father's departure from home and his mother's death, Edward tried to replace the role of the man for the Elric family. As a result, Van Hohenheim's reappearance caused a shocking and terrified reaction in the character. Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it.|$|E

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>problem</b> solving is {{generally}} thought to involve five sequential steps. These steps include encoding, interpretation, response search, response evaluation, and response selection. Acquiring <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills {{is a critical}} aspect of normal child development. These skills are necessary for effective interpersonal interactions with the peers and adults in a child 2 ̆ 7 s environment. Family interactions are thought to {{play a central role}} in the development of children 2 ̆ 7 s <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving abilities. In families where the parent-child relationship is extremely dysfunctional, as in cases of maltreatment, the <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving abilities of children would then be expected to show some impairment. The present study sought to examine how childhood histories of physical abuse, neglect, and exposure to wife assault were associated with different aspects of children 2 ̆ 7 s <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving abilities. Differential results according to sex were also considered.;Information about children 2 ̆ 7 s maltreatment histories was obtained from maternal and social worker reports. Boys and girls aged 8 - 13 completed a variety of <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving tasks. Results indicated that children with histories of childhood maltreatment showed some impairments in their <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving abilities. For example, a maltreatment history of physical abuse was associated with difficulties in interpretation and response selection. Similarly, a maltreatment history of exposure to wife abuse was associated with difficulties in response selection. Other results indicated that interactions between forms of maltreatment added to the prediction of response selection. For example, as exposure to wife abuse increased, the relationship between physical abuse and internalizing responses became weaker. Similarly, as exposure to verbal aggression increased, the relationship between wife abuse and externalizing responses became weaker. Children 2 ̆ 7 s sex was found to moderate some of the relationships between maltreatment and <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving abilities. Significant sex by maltreatment interactions were found for six of the eight measures of <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving used. Further, sex moderated the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving abilities only for children with maltreatment histories of physical abuse and neglect but not exposure to wife abuse. Finally, interactions between sex and physical abuse indicated that girls showed stronger associations with interpretation, response generation, and some aspects of response selection (internalizing and externalizing responses). Interactions between sex and neglect indicated that boys showed stronger associations with aspects of response selection (social competence, externalizing responses). Results suggest a strong sex differentiation in <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving abilities...|$|R
40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>problem</b> solving {{therapy is}} one helpful {{approach}} to treating people with personality disorders (PD). Consequently, {{it is worthwhile}} to develop {{a greater understanding of}} the role of <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving in PD. One hypothesis is that <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving mediates the relationship between personality dimensions and personality disorder. This premise was explored in a sample of male prisoners, a population known to have a high prevalence of PD. Sixty-eight men completed the International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE), NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) and the Social Problem-Solving Inventory – Revised: Short Version (SPSI-R:S). The data were explored for direct and indirect mediational effects of <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving variables in the personality dimension—PD relationship, using methods appropriate for small samples and multiple mediators. A number of relationships between personality dimensions, <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving, and personality disorder traits were identified, but only for paranoid, schizotypal, borderline, narcissistic, and avoidant PDs. These findings support the hypothesis that <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving mediates between personality dimensions and some PDs. Further research is necessary to verify these relationships, however, these findings begin to clarify the mechanisms by which personality dimensions relate to PDs. This knowledge has potential to {{contribute to the development of}} more effective interventions for people with particular personality dimensions and specific personality disorders...|$|R
40|$|The {{tension between}} {{technical}} experts and the populations {{they seek to}} serve is well established in the literature examining professional <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving. In this piece, I examine this tension as one between the distinct discursive worlds of technical expertise and community voice.

IMAP involves I 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;dentifying <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solvers, M 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;apping <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solvers 2 ̆ 7 claims, A 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;nalyzing professional orientations that arise from this mapping, and P 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;redicting, diagnosing, and remediating conflicts. IMAP can be used by analysts external to <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving settings or by <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solvers themselves. The use of IMAP by external experts poses questions of expert alignment with either of the discursive worlds. I examine two cases in public health practice settings: a mobile immunization service and the efforts of a foundation to improve health in an inner-city neighborhood. I develop four modal types that can be anticipated in <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving settings or, more specifically, in public health practice. Understanding of these “world views” can enhance mutual understanding between public health professionals and between public health professionals and the communities they seek to serve. IMAP might also address ongoing conflicts to clarify differences in unspoken normative commitments and the impact of these on <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving. I discuss implications of the research for public health practice and further research in the area. ...|$|R

During Megadeth's commercial peak, Mustaine elaborated on more personal themes such as addiction and intimate relationships. For the lyrics on Cryptic Writings, Mustaine said {{that he wanted to}} write songs that had more appeal to a wider audience. The title of United Abominations is a satiric play on the name of the United Nations; Mustaine criticized the organization's ineffectiveness on a number of songs on that album.

From 1899–1906 the movement became conclusively independent, shedding the patronizing thinking of the Fennoman estates, and it was represented by the Finnish Social Democratic Party, established in 1899. Workers' activism directed both toward opposing Russification and in developing a domestic policy that tackled <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> and responded to the demand for democracy.
