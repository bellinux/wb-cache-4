5|$|As {{indicated}} in the table below, each basin uses a separate system of terminology, which can make comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse will occur. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s), over , are called Super Typhoons by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{they appear to be}} sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|In addition, other {{characters}} have supporting roles {{in this game}} as well. Lakitu reprises {{his role as the}} referee, helping racers in various situations such as announcing laps, giving the signal to drive with its traffic lights hanging on a fishing pole, and taking characters back on track in case they fall off course. Other supporting characters appearing in this game include Shy Guys, Goombas, Nokis, Toadsworth, Piantas, Chain Chomps, Piranha Plants and more. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> this is the very first time that Toadette has appeared in the Mario franchise.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} algorithms reduce lattice bases. They can {{be compared}} in terms of runtime and approximation to an optimal solution, always relative to the dimension of the given lattice. If there are public implementations of these algorithms this <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> here.|$|R
25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that,</b> like in Highway Patrol before it, {{several of}} this {{generation}} Century appeared in the US television series Kojak, driven by Telly Savalas and other squadroom members.|$|E
25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Bianca Acquaye-Froese, Edgar's widow, {{has taken}} up the mantle of {{continuing}} {{the legacy of the}} group and works closely in a non-musical capacity with the remaining members.|$|E

25|$|The figures below {{come from}} Eurostat (2013) and are denoted in Euros, it notes the {{economic}} position of Scottish regions {{in terms of}} GDP and GDP per capita. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the Scottish figures exclude offshore oil revenue. There are 26 areas in the UK where the GDP per person is under €20,000.|$|E
25|$|According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, as of 2005, 650,000 Israelis {{had left}} the country for over one year and not returned. Of them, 530,000 are still alive today.

It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Israeli law grants citizenship only to the first generation of children born to Israeli emigrants.|$|E
25|$|Each cell {{division}} from a spermatogonium to a spermatid is incomplete; the cells remain connected {{to one another}} by bridges of cytoplasm to allow synchronous development. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> not all spermatogonia divide to produce spermatocytes; otherwise, the supply of spermatogonia would run out. Instead, spermatogonial stem cells divide mitotically to produce copies of themselves, ensuring a constant supply of spermatogonia to fuel spermatogenesis.|$|E
40|$|A {{thorough}} family history, {{the age at}} {{the time}} of onset and detailed information regarding the rate, mode of progression and distribution of weakness is needed for evaluation of patients with weakness and atrophy.

50|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> {{here that}} {{nanocomposite}} ceramic materials also offer interesting mechanical properties not achievable in other materials, such as superplastic flow and metal-like machinability. It is anticipated that further development {{will result in}} high strength, high transparency nanomaterials which are suitable for application as next generation armor.|$|R
25|$|In {{his final}} year to early March 2013 the Club lost all six matches in the Heineken Cup and {{recorded}} four league victories all {{season in the}} Pro12 against Cardiff, Zebre, Connacht and the Ospreys. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Edinburgh Rugby accumulated seven losing bonus points in this period highlighting the need for minor adjustments to change the sides fortunes on the pitch.|$|E
25|$|Claims that {{hydrogen}} peroxide therapy increase cellular levels of oxygen {{have not been}} supported. The quantities administered {{would be expected to}} provide very little additional oxygen compared to that available from normal respiration. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> it is difficult to raise the level of oxygen around cancer cells within a tumour, as the blood supply tends to be poor, a situation known as tumor hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|Their Christian and Muslim neighbors once {{looked upon}} the Abayudaya with disdain and hatred, but {{relations}} have improved significantly and some view {{members of the}} Abayudaya with respect and admiration.

However, as of 2013-present, Dodge no longer competes in NASCAR, however a possible return has been rumored.|$|R
30|$|The {{specificity}} {{of this study}} to off-label practice in the US between January 2000 and June 2009 <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted.</b> Off-label prescribing practices may vary from one jurisdiction to another: although vinorelbine is approved {{for use in the}} treatment of breast cancer in most European countries, this indication has not yet been approved in the US.|$|R
25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> UK {{legislation}} considers all lights, reflectors {{and reflective}} material to be lights, and all items resembling special warning beacons (of any color) must be covered {{and not just}} disconnected (as this is a separate offence) while on the public highway.

25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> it {{was usually}} only the frigates which took prizes; the ships of the line were far too {{ponderous}} {{to be able to}} chase and capture the smaller ships which generally carried treasure. Nelson always bemoaned that he had done badly out of prize money and even as a flag officer received little. This was not that he had a bad command of captains but rather that British mastery of the seas was so complete that few enemy ships dared to sail.|$|E
25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the {{feedback}} {{is not limited}} to a frequency divider. This element can be other elements such as a frequency multiplier, or a mixer. The multiplier will make the VCO output a sub-multiple (rather than a multiple) of the reference frequency. A mixer can translate the VCO frequency by a fixed offset. It may also be a combination of these. An example being a divider following a mixer; this allows the divider to operate at a much lower frequency than the VCO without a loss in loop gain.|$|E
50|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> in {{the above}} {{treatment}} that, contrary to Menger's analysis, no higher-paying lottery can generate a paradox which the time resolution - or, equivalently, Bernoulli's or Laplace's logarithmic resolutions - fail to resolve, since {{there is always a}} price at which the lottery should not be entered, even though for especially favourable lotteries this may be greater than one's worth.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the matches}} the new team had {{was against the}} other newly formed team of Roma's former partner, Jim Powers and Hercules's former rival, Jim Brunzell, in which Roma and Hercules were victorious when Roma pinned Brunzell after hitting their {{finisher}} on Brunzell for the win.
