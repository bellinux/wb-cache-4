This proposal includes an Article 11 on the “protection of press publications concerning digital uses”, {{according to which}} “Member States shall provide publishers of press publications with the rights provided for in Article 2 and Article 3 (2) of Directive 2001 / 29 /EC for the digital use of their press publications. ” Relying on the experiences and debates surrounding the German and Spanish laws in this area, this study presents a legal analysis of the proposal for an EU related right for press publishers (RRPP). After a brief overview over the general limits of the EU competence to introduce such a new related right, the study critically examines the purpose of an RRPP. On this basis, the next section distinguishes three versions of an RRPP with regard to its <b>subject-matter</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope,</b> and considers the practical and legal implications of these alternatives, in particular having regard to fundamental rights...|$|E

Primarily, considering the object ownership land, ie land and its special features, mainly its limited quantity. The thesis is composed of four parts further divided into chapters and subchapters. Part one deals with object of ownership land. The land has certain special characteristics: it has a multifunctional and indispensable character of the land, the limited extent and the irreplaceability, {{the fact that the}} land is not a result of human activities and finally, the special characteristic that the land is not consumed or destroyed by using. In this chapter is land also defined as a thing and as a plot of land. An important and signifiant institute of Land law is purpose-categorization of the land. I deal with that issue {{at the end of this}} part. Part two is focused on subjects-matter of ownership land. There is an interpretation of natural persons, legal entities, territorial self-governing units and state. Just as other things also the land may be owned by more than one owner.
