5|$|The Commission's final report, {{released}} in May 1940, reflected many of Macdonald's recommendations. Mackenzie King called a federal-provincial conference in January 1941 {{to discuss the}} report.

5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. Watering <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> regularly. However, plants {{should not be allowed to}} sit in water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E

5|$|The second {{safeguard}} clause was {{a commitment that}} nothing <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> which might prejudice {{the rights of the}} Jewish communities in other countries outside of Palestine. The original drafts of Rothschild, Balfour, and Milner did not include this safeguard, which was drafted together with the preceding safeguard in early October, in order to reflect opposition from influential members of the Anglo-Jewish community. Lord Rothschild took exception to the proviso on the basis that it presupposed the possibility of a danger to non-Zionists, which he denied.|$|E

5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely {{and replace it with a}} newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred.|$|E
5|$|All {{apprentices}} were to {{be educated}} in reading, writing and arithmetic {{for the first four}} years of their apprenticeship.

Educational classes should be held {{in a part of the}} mill or factory designed for the purpose. Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices {{were to be}} taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery.

However, he was not sure what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E

The polling conducted by Galaxy Research, {{on behalf of the}} Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education (FARE), also found that three in four Victorian voters (75 %) would like the party leaders to outline their plan to address alcohol-related harms prior to next month’s State election. However, in an apparent vote of no confidence, Victorians don’t seem to think either of the major parties are up to the task. Only 17 per cent of voters believe the Coalition would be best at reducing alcohol-related harms, 16 per cent the Labor Party, and ten per cent the Greens, with the {{majority of}} Victorians (57 %) uncommitted...|$|R

5|$|The {{idea for}} the game came from the producer, Masaru Oyamada, who wanted all Mana games to be playable on modern {{platforms}} for the series' 25th anniversary in 2016. Initially there was some argument at Square Enix about whether the remake <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in 2D or 3D; they chose 3D, as it {{was thought to be}} easier to control on smartphones and because it {{could be used as a}} base for potential future Mana remakes. The game has received positive reviews, with reviewers giving particular praise to the visuals and the music, and some calling it a better Final Fantasy Adventure remake than the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana had been.|$|E

Anatoly Artsebarsky argued that Mir should be kept because he believed that once it had been deorbited, the US would try to marginalise Russian involvement in the ISS. An online opinion poll showed 67% support worldwide for keeping it in orbit.|$|E

5|$|Beagle was {{not allowed}} to land at Tenerife through fears that those aboard would bring cholera, but the ship {{proceeded}} to Cape Verde, Fernando de Noronha and Rio de Janeiro. She then spent some time surveying the coast of South America south from Rio de Janeiro, around Tierra del Fuego, the coast of Chile and as far north as Peru. Fitz-Roy finally detached Beagle from South America in August 1835. The Admiralty had not precisely specified his itinerary across the Pacific since they could not be sure how far north {{he would be able to}} survey in the time available, and hence precisely where he would be leaving from. But they did specify that he should stop at Tahiti, a point of previously well-determined longitude. The Admiralty also required that, like the journey across the Atlantic, it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in small stages to frequently rate the chronometers. Fitz-Roy chose to go via the Galápagos Islands. Subsequently Beagle visited Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and Mauritius.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses. With the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April, {{the first}} {{prisoner}} {{escaped from the}} main camp; {{the same day that}} the injured second prisoner was taken in by Machuca and his men. Interrogation of the new prisoner, {{who turned out to be}} an Itza nobleman, revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish. Friar Cano met with his fellow Dominicans to discuss what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> having had information from both Machuca and his prisoner that the Itza were ready for war. The Dominicans were highly critical of the Spanish soldiers' readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them, and suspected that President Barrios was nowhere near the lake; furthermore the Spanish were beginning to succumb to sickness, and the Verapaz Indian recruits were deserting daily. Díaz agreed with the Dominicans; two muleteers had already died from sickness, and he recognised that the size of his expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with the Itza nation. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón. The new prisoner, AjK'ixaw was later taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans questioned him in detail. In Guatemala AjK'ixaw learnt Spanish and returned to Petén in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition, before turning on his captors. After the Spanish retreated to Guatemala, rumours ran rife among the Itza and Kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of the Maya population; large tracts of territory were abandoned in response, including many towns in an area stretching from Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to Mopán.|$|E

5|$|In May 1851 Metternich {{left for}} his Johannisberg estate, {{which he had}} last visited in 1845. That summer Metternich enjoyed the company of Prussian {{representative}} Otto von Bismarck. He also enjoyed a visit from Frederick William, though the King irritated Metternich by appearing to cultivate him as a tool against Schwarzenberg. In September Metternich returned to Vienna, entertained along the way by various German princes keen to entertain the focus of Prussian intrigue. Metternich was reinvigorated, dropped his nostalgia, and lived in the present {{for the first time}} in a decade. Franz Josef asked for his advice on numerous issues (though he was too headstrong to be much influenced by it), and both of the two emerging factions in Vienna courted Metternich; even Tsar Nicholas called on him during a state visit. Metternich was not keen on the new Foreign Minister, Karl Ferdinand von Buol but thought him sufficiently incompetent that he would be impressionable. Metternich's advice was of varying quality; nonetheless, some of it was usefully insightful, even in modern issues. Now deaf, Metternich wrote endlessly, particularly for an appreciative Franz Josef. He wanted Austrian neutrality in the Crimean War, though Buol did not. In the meantime Metternich's health was slowly failing, and he was a more peripheral figure after the death of his wife Melanie in January 1854. In a brief resurgence of energy in early 1856, he busied himself in arrangements for a marriage between his son Richard and his granddaughter Pauline (Richard's step-sister's daughter) and undertook more travel. The King of the Belgians came to visit, as did Bismarck, and on 16 August 1857 he entertained the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Buol, however, was growing more resentful of Metternich's advice, particularly about Italy. In April 1859 Franz Josef came to ask him about what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in Italy. According to Pauline, Metternich begged him not to send an ultimatum to Italy, and Franz Josef explained that such an ultimatum had already been sent.|$|E
