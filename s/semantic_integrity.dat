40|$|Abstract. Spatial join is {{the most}} {{expensive}} operation in geographic databases, but essentially important to compute spatial relationships intrinsic to geographic data. In account of spatial relationships real world entities may affect the behavior of other entities in the neighborhood. Spatial relationships are fundamental for knowledge discovery in geographic databases and are strongly related to the discovered patterns. Knowledge discovery is a user-dependent process, but the user is usually neither an expert in geographic databases nor in spatial relationships. This paper presents an approach {{to reduce the number of}} spatial relationships for knowledge discovery, using a geo-ontology and <b>semantic</b> spatial <b>integrity</b> constraints. We show how spatial constraints can help the user of knowledge discovery in both defining the semantically consistent spatial relationships and reducing the verification of unnecessary relationships. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Semantic</b> <b>integrity</b> {{constraints}} specify {{relations between}} entity classes. These relations must hold {{to ensure that}} the data conforms to the semantics intended by the data model. For spatial data many <b>semantic</b> <b>integrity</b> constraints are based on spatial properties like topological or metric relations. Reasoning on such spatial relations and the corresponding derivation of implicit knowledge allow for many interesting applications. The paper investigates reasoning algorithms which can be used to check the internal consistency of a set of spatial <b>semantic</b> <b>integrity</b> constraints. Since integrity constraints are defined at the class level, the logical properties of spatial relations can not directly be applied. Therefore a set of 17 abstract class relations has been defined, which combined with the instance relations enables the specification of integrity constraints. The investigated logical properties of the class relations enable to discover conflicts and redundancies in sets of spatial <b>semantic</b> <b>integrity</b> constraints...|$|E

At the heart of such systems are symbol structures (representations) designating'abstract solids'(subsets of Euclidean space) that model physical solids. Representations are the sources of data for procedures which compute useful properties of objects. The variety and uses of systems embodying representations of solids are growing rapidly, but so are the difficulties in assessing current designs, specifying the characteristics that future systems should exhibit, and designing systems to meet such specifications.

Moreover the degree of overlap between the neural substrates supporting episodic and semantic forms of prospection remains unclear. To this end, we sought to investigate the capacity for episodic and semantic future thinking in Alzheimer’s disease (n = 15) and disease-matched behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (n = 15), neurodegenerative disorders characterized by significant medial temporal lobe (MTL) and frontal pathology. Participants completed an assessment of past and future thinking across personal (episodic) and non-personal (semantic) domains, {{as part of a larger}} neuropsychological battery investigating episodic and semantic processing, and their performance was contrasted with 20 age- and education-matched healthy older Controls. Participants underwent whole-brain T 1 -weighted structural imaging and voxel-based morphometry analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between gray matter integrity and episodic and semantic future thinking. Relative to Controls, both patient groups displayed marked future thinking impairments, extending across episodic and semantic domains. Analyses of covariance revealed that while episodic future thinking deficits could be explained solely in terms of episodic memory proficiency, semantic prospection deficits reflected the interplay between episodic and semantic processing. Distinct neural correlates emerged for each form of future simulation with differential involvement of prefrontal, lateral temporal, and medial temporal regions.

Whereas episodic future thinking related to right hippocampal <b>integrity,</b> <b>semantic</b> future thinking was found to relate to left hippocampal integrity.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the nature of affect processing deficits in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through administration {{of a series of}} affect perception and interpretation tasks. Three tasks involved perceptual classification of emotional stimuli: (1) discrimination of face identity, (2) discrimination of genuine emotions from facial grimaces that did not conform to recognizable emotional expressions, and (3) discrimination of facial affect expressions. Tasks assessing (1) verbal identification of facial affect, (2) labeling of situational affect, and (3) matching facial affect photographs to emotions depicted in complex scenes, were used to investigate the integrity of more complex, semantic-associative processes in AD. Twenty adults with neurologic diagnoses of AD and 18 healthy control subjects participated in the study. The ability of AD patients to perform fundamental face processing tasks supported the hypothesis that basic perceptual classification functions may be spared in mild to moderate stages of AD. In contrast, AD patients were differentially impaired on associative affect tasks, suggesting breakdowns in processes relying upon the activation of higher-order, emotion-specific <b>semantic</b> representations. The <b>integrity</b> of a hierarchical model of face processing abilities was assessed by comparing the actual distribution of subjects' scores to three theoretical distributions. As predicted, the hierarchical model reflected the best 'goodness-of-fit' with both AD and control distributions. Evidence that AD patients were able to benefit from emotional cues on a task requiring subjects to match facial affect expressions to emotional scenes was interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that primary stores of affect knowledge are preserved in AD, but may be severely disorganized or inefficiently accessed. These findings were interpreted in terms of emotional semantics and their relationship to information processing models of facial affect recognition. Finally, no statistical relationship between affect processing variables and caregiver burden was found in the present study. The need for future studies to clarify the nature of semantic competency for affect processing in AD, and to provide a greater understanding of caregiver burden and its relationship to the emotional behavior of neurologically impaired adults, is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Co-verbal {{gestures}} {{can facilitate}} word production among persons with aphasia (PWA) (Rose, Douglas, & Matyas, 2002) {{and play a}} communicative role for PWA to convey ideas (Sekine & Rose, 2013). Kong, Law, Kwan, Lai, and Lam (2015) recently reported a systematic approach to independently analyze gesture forms and functions in spontaneous oral discourse produced. When this annotation framework {{was used to compare}} speech-accompanying gestures used by PWA and unimpaired speakers, Kong, Law, Wat, and Lai (2013) found a significantly higher gesture-to-word ratio among PWAs. Speakers who were more severe in aphasia or produced a lower percentage of complete sentences or simple sentences in their narratives tended to use more gestures. Moreover, verbal-semantic processing impairment, but not the degree of hemiplegia, was found to affect PWAs’ employment of gestures. The current study aims to (1) investigate whether the frequency of gestural employment varied across speakers with non-fluent aphasia, fluent aphasia, and their controls, (2) examine how the distribution of gesture forms and functions differed across the three speaker groups, and (3) determine how well factors of complexity of linguistic output, aphasia severity, <b>semantic</b> processing <b>integrity,</b> and hemiplegia would predict the frequency of gesture use among PWAs. Method The participants included 23 Cantonese-speaking individuals with fluent aphasia, 21 with non-fluent aphasia, and 23 age- and education-matched controls. Three sets of language samples and video files were collected through the narrative tasks of recounting a personally important event, sequential description, and story-telling, using the Cantonese AphasiaBank protocol (Kong, Law, & Lee, 2009). While the language samples were linguistically quantified to reflect word- and sentential-level performance as well as discourse-level characteristics, the videos were annotated on the form and function of each gesture. All PWAs were also administered tests that assessed their verbal and non-verbal semantic skills, oral naming abilities, aphasia syndromes and severities, and degree of hemiplegia. Results For Aim 1, results of Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed that the gesture-to-word ratio was significantly different across speaker groups, H(2) = 20. 13, p < 0. 001. Post-hoc analyses using Mann-Whitney tests revealed a significantly higher ratio in the non-fluent aphasic group (mean = 0. 27, SD = 0. 23), as compared to the fluent PWAs (mean = 0. 10, SD = 0. 12) and controls (mean = 0. 04, SD = 0. 05). Concerning Aim 2, deictic gestures were the most frequently used form of content-carrying co-verbal gestures by PWA and controls. Emblems, in contrast, were used the least. About half of the gestures employed did not serve a specific communication function in our speakers, but a higher proportion of the remaining half was used by controls to enhance the speech content. Both fluent and non-fluent PWAs, on the other hand, tended to use gestures to enhance the speech content and assist their lexical retrieval. As for Aim 3, results of a multiple regression suggested that PWAs’ discourse performance was significantly related to gesture to word ratio, F(1, 39) = 12. 955, p < 0. 01. Specifically, percentage of complete sentences and percentage of dysfluency significantly accounted for 24. 9 % and 14. 2 % of variance, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The Boston Naming Test (Kaplan et al 1983) is {{standardized}} {{on different}} populations {{and it is}} the most widely used naming test worldwide in both research and clinical settings. For this reason, this test was used to investigate naming performance in Maltese-speaking adults in a bilingual context. The first part of the research aimed to determine the demographic and word variables that affect naming performance in healthy Maltese people. It also aimed to propose an adaptation of the BNT to suit the linguistic and cultural characteristics of the Maltese population. The second part of the research, then, applied the findings obtained initially to establish whether the proposed test could be used clinically in assessing Maltese people with naming impairments. It sought to establish whether the proposed modified test was able to differentiate between people with impaired and unimpaired naming, and whether it could contribute to making a differential diagnosis. In order to obtain a measure of name agreement the BNT was administered to 24 individuals prior to the main study. Naming performance data was then collected from 60 healthy people. The BNT pictures were presented via a laptop and naming accuracy and reaction times were recorded. Analysis of the variables which affect naming performance was carried out. Finally, the BNT and additional tests of comprehension and repetition were administered on 18 people with aphasia to determine the suitability of the test for clinical use. Only 38 items of the BNT had at least 70 % name agreement. Therefore, a reduced test of 38 items was proposed and two alternative scoring methods were described: strict (accepting only dominant responses and their cognates) and lenient scoring (accepting all possible responses,including English equivalents). The research on healthy Maltese adults showed that education was the strongest predictor of naming accuracy. Age also remained significant in a stepwise regression analysis. The strongest predictor of naming latency was age, with evidence of a marked increase in reaction times after 66 years of age. Since older Maltese adults had fewer opportunities for education, cohort effects are likely. Some of the controls obtained very low scores which overlapped with the scores obtained by the people with aphasia. This indicated that scores alone cannot be used to differentiate between impaired and unimpaired people. On the other hand, some types of errors were only produced by people with impaired naming, and did not appear at all in error profiles of unimpaired individuals. Although particular types of errors were associated with particular levels of breakdown in spoken word production, a degree of overlap between errors and levels ofbreakdown became apparent. A reduced set of the BNT with lenient scoring was found to be the most suitable test for assessing Maltese people at risk of naming impairments. It is recommended that test standardization in the elderly should consider cohort effects and regular test updates should be carried out. In order to differentiate between people with impaired and unimpaired naming it is necessary to look at error profiles, apart from the number of errors, as the presence of atypical errors is the best indicator of naming impairments. Further, it was concluded that, although error profiles may prove to be valuable in differential diagnosis, they cannot be used on their own, as they do not provide sufficient information. A variety of additional tasks of <b>semantic</b> and phonological <b>integrity</b> must also be utilized to make conclusive decisions regarding differential diagnosis...|$|R
