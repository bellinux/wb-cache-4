Additionally, the complete inhibition of catalyst activity observed when employing tap water could be alleviated by the inclusion of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) into the aqueous media prior to reaction initiation.

40|$|We report {{measured}} solubilities of five aminium (i. e., monomethyl, dimethyl, trimethyl, diethyl, and triethyl) sulphate salts {{in water}} at 24 °C, and the densities of their <b>aqueous</b> <b>solutions.</b> Using these results, we have converted hygroscopic growth factors determined by Qiu and Zhang (Environ.

The results are compared with values predicted using the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM) of Clegg and co-workers (J. Geophys. Res. 2002, 107, D 14, Art. No. 4207). It is assumed in this model that ion and water activities in the solutions {{are the same as}} those for aqueous (NH) SO at the same molality. The experimental and modelled growth factors agree well in all cases, within the uncertainties of the data, which supports this assumption.

Nevertheless, when both compounds were present, the steady-state fluxes through the epidermis increased by factors of 5. 2 and 2. 6 for MP and CP, respectively. Within the variability of the measurements, this increase in MP flux {{is consistent with the}} 6. 4 -fold increase in the SC uptake, which occurs primarily into the nonlipid regions of the SC. In contrast, the 1. 6 -fold increase in CP uptake when MP is present is too small to explain the increase in CP flux.

40|$|Understanding of the {{long-term}} dissolution of waste forms in groundwater {{is required for the}} safe disposal of high level nuclear waste in a geologic repository, because waste-form radionuclides could be released by dissolution and transported in groundwater. The dissolution of the uranium dioxide (UO{sub 2 }) matrix in spent nuclear fuel is considered the rate-limiting step for release of radioactive fission products. The intrinsic UO{sub 2 } dissolution rate sets an upper limit on the aqueous radionuclide release rate. Unsaturated spent fuel tests have shown that pH`s of leachates have decreased to a range of 4 to 6, presumably due to air radiolysis that oxidizes nitrogen, producing nitric acid. Dissolution rates under such acidic conditions may be different than those previously reported for alkaline groundwater conditions. No dissolution rate measurements of UO{sub 2 } or spent fuel have been reported for acidic conditions possibly relevant to a geologic repository.
