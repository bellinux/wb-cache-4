However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was malleable, yet at times it was highly brittle. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later {{come to be known as}} the platinum group metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.|$|E

Most of the news conveyed by De Soto was of a mundane characterfor example, reports of activity on the Havana sugar marketbut <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> of more interest. In October 1860 for instance, De Soto reported the interception at Sierra Morena, Cuba of an illegal slave ship carrying 800 African slaves. The captain and crew of the slave ship were detained by local authorities, but about 400 of the slaves had already been dispersed ashore {{and could not be}} retrieved.|$|E

25|$|Shallow epi{{continental}} seas {{like the}} current North Sea have since long existed on the European continental shelf. The rifting {{that formed the}} northern part of the Atlantic Ocean during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, from about , caused tectonic uplift in the British Isles. Since then, a shallow sea has almost continuously existed between the uplands of the Fennoscandian Shield and the British Isles. This precursor of the current North Sea has grown and shrunk with the rise and fall of the eustatic sea level during geologic time. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> connected with other shallow seas, such as the sea above the Paris Basin to the south-west, the Paratethys Sea to the south-east, or the Tethys Ocean to the south.|$|E

25|$|In ancient Egyptian art, female {{pubic hair}} is {{indicated}} {{in the form of}} painted triangles.

The same was true in much of Indian art, and in other Eastern portrayals of the nude. In 16th century southern Europe, Michelangelo showed the male David with stylized pubic hair, but female bodies were depicted hairless below the head. Nevertheless, Michelangelo's male nudes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling display no pubic hair. In Renaissance northern Europe, pubic hair was more likely to be portrayed than in the south, more usually male, while occasionally on female figures.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, captains {{operating}} ships in icebound waters discovered that <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> easier {{to break through}} ice by running their vessels astern. Although not known at the time, this was because the forward-facing propellers generated a lubricating water flow that lowered the ice resistance by reducing friction between the ship's hull and ice. However, as the steering ability of a ship is greatly reduced when running astern, {{it could not be}} considered a main operating mode. These findings resulted in the adoption of bow propellers in older icebreakers operating in the Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, but in the more severe Arctic ice conditions they could not be used because the risk of the bow propellers being damaged by multi-year ice floes was too great. Furthermore, forward-facing propellers have a very low propulsion efficiency and they considerably increase the ship's open water resistance, making them unsuitable for merchant ships.|$|E

Overall, their service was not remarkable: {{there was at least}} one sudden fatal flat spin, while another Re.2000 had fatal engine damage (a piston was literally driven through the cylinder) and crash-landed, overturning, catching fire and almost killing its pilot (rescued by the ground crew). Although the Reggiane had a long range, it was disliked and even feared by ground crew and pilots, for its difficult maintenance and unpredictable engine reliability and handling. The last Re.2000 was sent back to the factory in September 1942.|$|E
25|$|Although icebreaking {{cargo ships}} {{had been built}} in the past, their hull forms were always compromises between open water {{performance}} and icebreaking capability. A good icebreaking bow, designed to break the ice by bending it under the ship's weight, has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to slamming in heavy weather while a hydrodynamically efficient bulbous bow greatly increases the ice resistance. However, already in the late 1800s captains operating ships in icebound waters discovered that <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> easier to break through ice by running their vessels astern.
