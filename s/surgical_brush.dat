40|$|A gloved-hand {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for evaluating the}} interaction of antimicrobial agents with the normal resident bacterial flora of human skin. One of the key features of the experimental model is a simplified technique for sampling the skin, which involves the addition of eluting fluid to the gloved hand. As with other skin sampling techniques, the number of bacteria recovered from the hands showed considerable variation from subject to subject. However, {{no significant differences were}} observed between the numbers of bacteria recovered from the right and left hands of individual subjects. The mean number of bacteria recovered from the hand before and after washing with nonmedicated soap was consistent and reproducible over a period of at least 5 consecutive days. The number of recoverable bacteria from the hand was greatly reduced by a single treatment with a surgical scrub preparation containing hexachlorophene. The extent of skin degerming achieved was little affected by the use of a <b>surgical</b> <b>brush,</b> and was maximal at approximately 30 min after contact with the hexachlorophene-containing formulation. It was determined that the level of transient bacteria on the hands could be controlled by a simple wash with nonmedicated soap, resulting in a stabilized base-line level from which treatment interactions with the resident microflora could be measured more precisely. The basic elements of the method presented fulfill the requirements of a satisfactory experimental model for the in vivo evaluation of skin-degerming agents on the hand. The selection of appropriate experimental designs allows treatment comparisons to be made {{with a high degree of}} statistical confidence...|$|E

40|$|This {{systematic}} review aimed to critically appraise and synthesize updated {{evidence on the}} impact of surgical scrub techniques on participants’ skin. We searched CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline and Cochrane Central. Our review was limited to peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs published in English from 1990 to 2014. A total of ten trials including eight RCTs and two Non-RCTs were reviewed. Comparison models were: traditional hand scrubbing with chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine against alcohol based hand rubbing (n= 6), <b>surgical</b> scrub with <b>brush</b> versus brushless (n= 3), detergent-based antiseptics alone versus antiseptics incorporating alcohol solutions (n= 1). Evidence showed that hand rubbing techniques are as effective as traditional scrubbing, and seem to be better tolerated. Hand rubbing appears to cause less skin damage than traditional scrub protocols; brushless techniques were better than scrubbing using a brush.

40|$|Resumo: Para remoção de endotoxinas aderi das à superfície radicular de dentes comprometidos {{periodontal}}mente terapias com objetivo de preservar o cemento radicular têm sido utilizadas. Esta pesquisa foi proposta para avaliar os resultados clínic'os obtidos após terapia periodontal cirúrgica para descontaminação da superfície radicular, removendo apenas depósitos de cálculo visíveis com aparelho ultra-sônico associado a escovação com tetraciclina a 40 % (grupo teste), e escovação com soro fisiológico (grupo controle). Foram selecionados 20 pacientes, com diagnóstico de periodontite do adulto, apresentando dentes unirradiculares com faces interproximais com profundidade de sondagem 2 Abstract: The goal ofthe {{present investigation}} was to compare, clinically, two surgi cal procedures for root detoxification. Twenty patients diagnosed with adult periodontitis and showing at least four interproximal sites with a probing depth 5 mm on anterior area were included. AlI patients received oral hygiene instruction and supragengival ultrasonic instrumentation. They {{were randomly assigned to}} one of treatments: surgical ultrasonic instrumentation and brushing with tetracycline gel (test group) and <b>surgical</b> instrumentation and <b>brushing</b> with saline solution (control group). The following clinical parameters plaque index, gingival index, position of the gingival margin, relative clinical attachment level and probing depth were evaluated at pre treatment, baseline, and 1, 2, 3 e 4 month after surgery. Clinical parameters recorded at pre treatment and baseline prepare were statistically significant difference of another evaluated time into each group. Both group during 1, 2, 3 and 4 month after periodontal therapy, showed retraction on position of the gingival margin, gain on relative attachment level, resulting on reduction of probing depth. The comparison of treatment using ultrasonic instrumentation and brushing with 40 % tetracycline and brushing with saline didn't show significant statistical difference on clinical parameters evaluate...|$|R
