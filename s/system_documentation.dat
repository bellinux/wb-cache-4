The dynamic and interactive features of live documents provide a consistent data source for multimedia presentations targeted to various audiences and multiple platforms.

We motivate the use of live documents with sample scenarios from the field of <b>systems</b> <b>documentation.</b> We further discuss how live documents can benefit from an interdisciplinary research approach across the fields of technical communications, <b>systems</b> <b>documentation,</b> and software engineering.
