5|$|The {{project is}} funded through an equity {{contribution}} of about USD 200m from Diwaco, a USD 300m grant and a USD 100m <b>stand-by</b> <b>facility</b> from the Jordanian government, {{as well as}} USD 475m in foreign loans to Diwaco. The project's total cost {{is expected to be}} $1.1 billion USD. The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation has lent USD 250m to Diwaco to support U.S. foreign investment on the basis that General Electric partially owns GAMA Energy. The state-owned French bank PROPARCO, which is the part of the French Development Agency (AFD) that supports private sector development, and the European Investment Bank (EIB) each lent about USD 100m to Diwaco. The loan package has been put together by the Arab Banking Corporation. Much of the government grant supporting the project comes from sovereign soft loans that the government of Jordan has borrowed from the EIB and AFD and passes on as a grant to the project. AFD provided USD 50m for the state grant and USD 48m for the <b>stand-by</b> <b>facility.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s {{the site was}} cleared for a new gas/oil-fuelled power station in 1974-78, but this was used only as a <b>stand-by</b> <b>facility</b> and this was also demolished, {{some time in the}} 1990s. The site is now used for {{step-down}} transformers.|$|E

50|$|In November 2007 Gurgenidze was {{appointed}} as the Prime Minister of Georgia and served a one-year term until October 2008. During his short tenure as the Prime Minister, Gurgenidze has initiated significant {{changes to the}} fiscal and monetary laws of Georgia which {{paved the way for}} Georgia to become a regional trade and financial hub. Gurgenidze has also instigated changes to the Georgian financial services sector and improved the law of Georgia on industrial zones. After the armed conflict between Russia and Georgia, in August 2008, Gurgenidze has played a vital role in stabilising the Georgian economy and financial services sector. He obtained (in September 2008) US$750 million <b>stand-by</b> loan <b>facility</b> from International Monetary Fund and brought into country US$4.5 billion donor aid. As a result of his efforts, the Georgian economy stabilised after the armed conflict with Russia which coincided with the world financial crisis.|$|R
50|$|During the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War, Yemen {{supported}} Iraq in its {{invasion of}} Kuwait, thereby alienating Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which both had provided critical {{financial assistance to}} Yemen. In addition to withdrawing this aid, Saudi Arabia expelled almost 1 million Yemeni workers. The resultant fall in expatriate remittances had a disastrous impact on Yemen's governmental budget. The civil war of 1994 further drained the economy, and in 1995 Yemen sought the aid of multilateral agencies. In 1996 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) granted Yemen a US$190 million <b>stand-by</b> credit <b>facility,</b> and the following year it approved two funding facilities that increased the country's credit by approximately US$500 million. The funding was contingent on Yemen's adoption of stringent economic reforms, a requirement that the country had limited success in fulfilling. As a result, the IMF suspended lending to Yemen from late 1999 until February 2001. The extension of the two funding facilities, particularly the poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF), through October 2001 was again contingent on Yemen's commitment to economic reform. Because of Yemen's failure to comply sufficiently with the terms imposed by the IMF, since 2002 the IMF has withheld US$300 million in concessional financing. Discussions over the renewal of the PRGF are ongoing. In 2000 Kuwait and Saudi Arabia resumed financial aid to Yemen.|$|R

5000|$|... • Conditionality: The Paris Club only negotiates debt restructurings with debtor {{countries}} that: 1) need debt relief. Debtor {{countries are}} expected to provide a precise description of their economic and financial situation, 2) have implemented and are committed to implementing reforms to restore their economic and financial situation, and 3) have a demonstrated track record of implementing reforms under an IMF program. This means in practice that the country must have a current program supported by an appropriate arrangement with the IMF (<b>Stand-By,</b> Extended Fund <b>Facility,</b> Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, Policy Support Instrument). The level of the debt treatment {{is based on the}} financing gap identified in the IMF program. In the case of a flow treatment, the consolidation period coincides with the period when the IMF arrangement shows a need for debt relief. When the flow treatment extends {{over a long period of}} time (generally more than one year), the Paris Club agreement is divided into phases. The amounts falling due during the first phase are treated as soon as the agreement enters into force. Subsequent phases are implemented following completion of conditions mentioned in the Agreed Minutes, including non-accumulation of arrears and approval of the reviews of the IMF program.|$|R
