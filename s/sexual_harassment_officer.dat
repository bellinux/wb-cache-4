5000|$|In the Roman {{army of the}} Republic, sex among fellow {{soldiers}} violated the decorum against intercourse with citizens and was subject to harsh penalties, including death, {{as a violation of}} military discipline.

Ancient sources are most concerned with the effects of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> by <b>officers,</b> but the young soldier who brought an accusation against his superior needed to show that he had not willingly taken the passive role or prostituted himself. Soldiers were free to have relations with their male slaves; the use of a fellow citizen-soldier's body was prohibited, not homosexual behaviors per se.

The research was located in the interpretive paradigm hence it adopted qualitative approach and used a case study design. Purposive sampling was used to select three college managers, ten lecturers and twenty five student participants. Seven of the students were interviewed individually using semi-structured interviews while 18 of them constituted 3 focus groups of six students each that completed the data collection by interview. The study found that there was <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> of students by some lecturers in the colleges. The study also established that students got the message that some lecturers did not value students and on occasion treated them in a degrading manner. The study also established that students used some strategies to cope including avoidance, appealing to authorities and counselling. The study recommended that in cases of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment,</b> specially trained <b>officers</b> in handling <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> cases for reporting such cases be put in place so that in view of the culture of fear of victimization and stigmatization, students may be forthcoming in reporting such sensitive and personal matters so that these are curtailed...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} thought that homosexuality incurred this punishment, but Polybius limits potential offenders to [...] "young {{men who have}} abused their persons", that is, who have willingly submitted to penetration. A Roman man could engage in same-sexual relations without loss to his status or perceived masculinity, {{as long as he}} took the dominant or penetrative role, but making sexual use of a fellow citizen's body was a violation of the principle of liberty. Acceptable male partners had to be of lower status, in the military typically slaves. A soldier who chose to be penetrated [...] "abused his person" [...] by violating the sexual hierarchy, especially since Romans equated sexual and military dominance. He undermined military discipline if he offered himself as sexually receptive in exchange for gifts or favors.

40|$|This thesis {{highlights}} the importance of workers’ perceptions of and attitudes to <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> Past researchers have found that a variety of individual factors (age, gender, gender role, and past experiences of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment),</b> and organisational factors (gender ratio, <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> policies and the role of employers), correlate with the incidence of sexually harassing behaviours. Two studies presented in this thesis extend this research and were designed to investigate how these factors relate to workers’ attitudes towards and perceptions of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> Study one investigated 176 workers from a large, white-collar organisation. Study two sampled 75 workers from a smaller, blue-collar organisation. By comparing two different workplaces the effect of the organisational climate was investigated. Individuals from Study two experienced more <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment,</b> were more tolerant of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> and perceived less behaviour as <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> compared with individuals from Study one. The organisational context was found to affect the way in which organisational and individual factors related to workers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes to and their experiences of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> However, the factors that influenced workers’ perceptions of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> were stable across both studies. Although workers’ attitudes to and their perceptions of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> were significantly correlated, they were influenced by different factors. Overall, workers’ perceptions of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> were influenced by their attitudes, the behavioural context, and the gender of the victim and perpetrator. In contrast, attitudes to <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> appeared to be more strongly influenced by individual factors, such as age, gender, gender role, past experiences of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment,</b> and perceptions of management’s tolerance of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> The broader implications of these findings are discussed and recommendations for future research are suggested...|$|R

The {{ubiquitous}} availability of digital technology devices has facilitated many instances of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> Such <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> occurs through unprovoked and offensive e-mails, messages posted on electronic bulletin boards, and other means available on the Internet. To date, courts remain silent on this issue. Should this type of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> be treated differently from physical <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment?</b> The surprising answer is yes. This Article suggests a new judicial framework for addressing <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> perpetrated through digital communications. This framework accounts for the real-world technology in place in the digital workplace and the legal framework that courts have constructed in connection with affirmative defense to <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> The fundamental difference between digital and physical <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> is the employer 2 ̆ 7 s ability to monitor and block offensive digital communications and thus prevent digital <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> This possibility of prevention is the underlying reason for treating the two forms of harassment differently and for modifying the existing affirmative defense. This Article proposes that when an employer fails to use available technology to prevent known digital <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> issues, the affirmative defense should be modified or unavailable. Adopting this approach would compel employers to use monitoring and blocking technology as a way to eliminate digital <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> in the workplace...|$|R

No {{study has been}} done so far in Zimbabwe on employeesâ€™ perceptions of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> The study aimed at determining the effectiveness of strategies implemented at Cresta Jameson Hotel to deal with <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> The other objective was to establish the impacts of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> among employees at Jameson Hotel. The research was a case study and used purposive and convenient sampling. The study population were the managers and non-managerial employees. The study obtained its findings from face to face interviews, company records, journals and text books. The targeted population was 35 employees. The researcher interviewed three managers and 26 non-managerial employees at Cresta Jameson Hotel. The response rate was 84 %. It was found that <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> was common at Cresta Jameson Hotel. Males were identified as the main perpetrators of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> Employees were afraid of reporting <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> cases as they were ridiculed due to limited confidentiality. The hotel lacked training and adequate policies on <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> The researcher suggested that hotels should formulate strong <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> policies. There is need to train and retrain employees continuously on <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> Hotels should encourage employees to report cases of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> and ensure them of confidentiality. Further research can be undertaken in other hotels in Zimbabwe...|$|R
