40|$|The paper studies a {{model of}} {{delegated}} search. The distribution of search revenues is unknown to the principal {{and has to be}} elicited from the agent in order to design the optimal search policy. At the same time, the search process is unobservable, requiring search to be self-enforcing. The two information asymmetries are mutually enforcing each other; if one is relaxed, delegated search is efficient. With both asymmetries prevailing simultaneously, search is almost surely inefficient (it is stopped too early). Second-best remuneration is shown to optimally utilize a menu of <b>simple</b> <b>bonus</b> contracts. In contrast to standard adverse selection problems, indirect nonlinear tariffs are strictly dominated. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{standard}} principal-agent model with moral hazard {{to allow for}} agents having reference- dependent preferences according to Köszegi and Rabin (2006, 2007). The main finding is that loss aversion leads to fairly simple contracts. In particular, when shifting the focus from standard risk aversion to loss aversion, the optimal contract is a <b>simple</b> <b>bonus</b> contract, i. e. when the agent's performance exceeds a certain threshold he receives a fixed bonus payment. Moreover, if the agent is sufficiently loss averse, it is shown that the first-order approach is not necessarily valid. If {{this is the case}} the principal may be unable to fine-tune incentives. Strategic ignorance of information by the principal, however, allows to overcome these problems and may even reduce the cost of implementation.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{contingent}} reinforcement {{on a variety}} of work behaviors have been well known in the organizational behavior management (OBM) literature for some time (e. g., Hopkins, 1987; Mawhinney, 1975). While most applications of monetary incentive-based programs have focused on the individual, this trend is gradually expanding to include group-based pay for performance programs as promising results of this type of system are reported (Honeywell-Johnson & Dickinson, 1999; Kovac, 1986). By using group-based contingencies, individual employees often become more aware of how their own performance affects the group and organization collectively. As a result, individuals are better able to determine the impact of their performance on an organizations ’ financial status. A concurrent awareness among individual employees and their performance, as well as the organization’s success has not always been accomplished with individual employee-based compensation systems. Open Book Management Defined Although many organizations are realizing the added benefits of contingent reinforcement and group-based compensation programs, compensation alone is not enough. <b>Simple</b> <b>bonus</b> compensation can not ensure the success of the organization or that worker performance has a direct relationship to net profits. Therefore, a growing number of organizations are implementing a hybrid form of group-based compensation, entitled “open-book management ” (Stack, 1992). The open book management system consists of four basic principles:! Sharing financial and operational information with all employees! Creating business literacy in all employees! Creating accountability for financial and operational outcomes with each employee! Giving employees a stake in the success of the organizatio...|$|E

The exact mechanism most studied so far grants each voter a regular vote for each decision, that cannot be stored, and a stock of bonus votes that can instead be spent freely over the different decisions.

50|$|The game {{starts with}} a simple court but it gets {{progressively}} more difficult with added obstacles, <b>simple</b> mazes and <b>bonus</b> items. There are 130 courts in total (64 on the C64, 30 on the BBC/Electron). A court is completed when either player scores three goals. If the computer wins in the single-player game, that is game over although the game can be restarted from the same court. Goals can score a range of points depending on how far out they are scored from.|$|R
40|$|Executive pay {{research}} has traditionally focused on salary, severance payments and longterm incentives. A systematic rigorous empirical examination of short-term annual bonuses is lacking. To address this omission, this research empirically examines {{the relationship between}} short-term bonuses and firm performance (TSR and EPS), in the UK. It also considers the association between form of bonus payment (i. e. cash/shares), and type of performance target (i. e. hard/soft and simple/complex) with bonus and performance. Furthermore, firm size and particular corporate governance factors are included (i. e. NED ratio on remuneration committee, CEO presence on nominations committee, CEO/Chair duality, tenure, and power) to examine their relationship with bonus value. From a sample of 299 firms listed in the FTSE- 350 (1, 542 executives including 300 CEOs), this study uses two competing theories (i. e. agency and power theory) to provide a fuller explanation of the subtleties of the pay-performance relation. The main findings support the agency view, since bonus is positively and significantly associated with financial performance. As with previous studies on executive bonus pay this association remains weak. By implication, power theory is not supported. However, other findings indicate: (1) although firm size may change, the proportion of bonus pay relative to salary does not vary. This suggests that large and small firms pay out proportionally similar bonuses; (2) cash bonuses are not positively related with {{the total value of}} bonus pay, suggesting that they are not any more open to abuse than other methods of compensation, as agency theory would predict; (3) cash bonuses encourage short-term achievement, as predicted by power theory; (4) consistent with agency theory, share-based bonuses are positively related to bonus pay and performance (weak association), suggesting that share-based bonuses (rather than cash bonuses) may be more effective at aligning pay with performance; (5) in line with agency theory, transparency (i. e. hard (external/published) and <b>simple</b> <b>bonus</b> conditions) is positively associated with performance, providing support for the alignment between principals' and agents' interests; (6) detailed bonus scheme characteristics are generally insensitive to performance and are becoming increasingly softer (i. e. more internal/unspecified targets) and complex (i. e. multiple targets). On the power view, these may create opportunities for executives to mask weak performance and extract greater rents; (7) governance factors are insignificant, suggesting that efforts to improve this area may be wasted, since they mainly leave pay-performance sensitivities unaffected. However, based on power theory, weak governance may foster the rise of powerful executives and widen the pay-performance gap. Therefore, it is suggested that close monitoring of executive pay must continue and shareholders should remain vigilant. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
