They enable the developer to specify which parts of the model should not be changed throughout the lifetime of the system. Thus, they prevent the violation of important design decisions during {{the evolution of a}} system model. The context-based component outline instruction language ConCOIL consists of four layers: the global business object layer combines those business objects identified during analysis into one single, global view.

It also provides facilities for storing additional information, specific to particular types of decision diagrams. Properties of XML enable us to define a standard that is flexible enough to be applicable to various existing types of decision diagrams {{as well as new}} types that could be defined in the future. The existence of such a standard permits efficient storage and exchange of data in decision diagram form between various software systems.

The hidden investment hypothesis was derived from a 13 -year longitudinal study of the career progress of a cohort of 85 college graduates who joined a single Japanese company in the same year, and states that the higher the quality of the vertical exchange relationship between a manager and supervisor, the greater the career progress of that manager. To test for {{the generalizability of}} the hidden investment hypothesis, 1, 075 line managers at four different hierarchical levels were sampled from five of the leading corporations in Japan.

40|$|Introduction: There is {{considerable}} {{debate about the}} strength {{and quality of the}} evidence base which underpins principles of good design of the lived environment and the causal pathways to good mental and physical health. In England, there has been no single source of summary evidence to guide good practice. The University of the West of England (UWE) was commissioned by Public Health England (PHE) to provide a UK focused evidence review which PHE adapted into a more ‘user-friendly' version to help public health professionals working with planners in local government to support planning decisions which can promote health Methods: UWE conducted an umbrella literature review to assess existing review level evidence. Unlike traditional systematic reviews, umbrella reviews involve a ‘rapid review' approach to evidence synthesis to produce an evidence overview in relatively short time. Key objectives were to: 1) assess the impact of the built and natural environment on health in five key domains. · appraise the quality and strength of the available evidence, using an agreed grading system; 2) use the findings of the review to develop a series of diagrams illustrating the linkages between planning principles, impact and health related outcomes, 3) use UK focused evidence and case studies, wherever possible. Results: Umbrella literature reviews bring together a wide range of evidence to explore what is known about a topic to guide decisions of policy makers. The results of the project are a series of practical diagrams that illustrate the linkages, and strength of evidence, between spatial planning and health based on the findings from the umbrella literature review of the impacts of the built environment on health for each 5 domains of: built environment topics: neighbourhood design, housing, healthy food, natural and sustainable environment, and transport. The full research study upon which the diagrams were based are also publicly available. Discussion: Although there is much guidance supporting action on the built and natural environment to improve health outcomes, the evidence base is still a matter of debate amongst the scientific and the practitioner communities. Using umbrella review methodology to examine the strength of the evidence of these health impacts, we developed a series of diagrams that illustrate the linkages and strength of evidence in five domains [...] These are intended to support public health and planning professionals when considering the health impacts of proposed local planning developments. We will present the findings of the review and <b>summary</b> <b>diagrams</b> for the five domains...|$|R

The flow of medium through inlet pipe to cylinder {{was assumed to be}} one-dimensional and described with mass, momentum and angular momentum conservation equations and energy conservation law. On the other hand, a zero-dimensional model described by mass-energy conservation equations was used to determine parameters of the medium in total cylinder volume. Simulations were carried out with the use of numerical programme in which McCormack’s explicit method was applied to solve differential equations describing the flow of charge in inlet system.

Four examples of diagrams from the scientific literature are used to indicate the problems and possible solutions: a table of images, a flow chart, a set of x,y data plots, and a block diagram. Manual summaries are first constructed. Two sources of information are used to guide summarization. The first is the internal structure of the diagram itself, its topology and geometry. The other is the text in captions, running text, and within diagrams. The diagram structure can be generated using the author's constraint-based diagram understanding system. Once the structure is obtained, procedures such as table element elision or subgraph deletion are used to produce a simpler summary form.

40|$|One of {{the aims}} of the 'Leveraging R&D for the Australian built environment' project is to develop a {{strategic}} roadmap {{for the future of the}} Australian built environment industry by assessing the likely future landscapes that R&D investment will both respond to and anticipate. In the process of developing the roadmap, the research is taking the Construction 2020 report as a starting point and extending the analyses conducted there to include wider macro-social 'sectors and factors' that may have a significant impact on this critical Australian industry. The sectors and factors are like a map of alternative building blocks in the wider macro-social landscape. Scenarios can be developed from combining these sectors and factors in many different ways to allow for the consideration of a very wide variety of plausible futures landscapes. The map then becomes a way of scanning for and measuring future developments.

40|$|This first paper {{discusses}} {{and explains}} the extant {{studies on the}} management of innovation for global fashion and textile businesses. The discussion is deliberately broad, encompassing research on innovations {{from a number of}} academic disciplines including marketing, engineering design, technological management, information management and organization science. The purpose is to establish an understanding of the contextual aspects that fundamentally pervade the volatile global innovation activities of today. At the start, we observe the global fashion and textile businesses and attempt to make generalizations about global fashion and textile innovation process using a process-chain perspective. To explore the essence for the sustenance of competitive innovation, we review the competing innovation management paradigms in the fields of organization behavioural science, information processing and systems thinking. On these premises, we conclude with the target of better innovation process performance and more effective and intelligent methods to attain such performance. This paper continues with a discussion of two major approaches to the improvement and development of processes: (i) socio-technical systems and (ii) soft systems.

40|$|In this note, we {{answer the}} {{questions}} "What does Chern-Simons theory assign to a point?" and "What kind of mathematical object does Chern-Simons theory assign to a point?". Our answer {{to the first question}} is representations of the based loop group. More precisely, we identify a certain class of projective unitary representations of the based loop group Ω G that we locally normal representations. We define the fusion product of such representations and we prove that, modulo certain conjectures, the Drinfel'd centre of that representation category of Ω G is equivalent to the category of positive energy representations of the free loop group LG. The above mentioned conjectures are known to hold when the gauge group is abelian or of type A_ 1. Our answer to the second question is bicommutant categories. The latter are higher categorical analogs of von Neumann algebras: they are tensor categories that are equivalent to their bicommutant inside Bim(R), the category of bimodules over a hyperfinite III_ 1 factor. We prove that, modulo certain conjectures, the category of locally normal representations of the based loop group is a bicommutant category. The relevant conjectures are known to hold when the gauge group is abelian or of type A_n. Our work builds on the formalism of coordinate free conformal nets, developed jointly with A. Bartels and C.

40|$|Dense retinotopy {{data sets}} were {{obtained}} by microelectrode visual receptive field mapping in dorsal and lateral visual cortex of anesthetized owl monkeys. The cortex was then physically flatmounted and stained for myelin or cytochrome oxidase. Retinotopic mapping data were digitized, interpolated to a uniform grid, analyzed using the visual field sign technique—which locally distinguishes mirror image from nonmirror image visual field representations—and correlated with the myelin or cytochrome oxidase patterns. The region between V 2 (nonmirror) and MT (nonmirror) contains three areas—DLp (mirror), DLi (nonmirror), and DLa/MTc (mirror). DM (mirror) was thin anteroposteriorly, and its reduced upper field bent somewhat anteriorly away from V 2. DI (nonmirror) directly adjoined V 2 (nonmirror) and contained only an upper field representation that also adjoined upper field DM (mirror). Retinotopy was used to define area VPP (nonmirror), which adjoins DM anteriorly, area FSTd (mirror), which adjoins MT ventrolaterally, and TP (mirror), which adjoins MT and DLa/MTc dorsoanteriorly. There was additional retinotopic and architectonic evidence for five more subdivisions of dorsal and lateral extrastriate cortex—TA (nonmirror), MSTd (mirror), MSTv (nonmirror), FSTv (nonmirror), and PP (mirror). Our data appear quite similar to data from marmosets, though our field sign-based areal subdivisions are slightly different. The region immediately anterior to the superiorly located central lower visual field V 2 varied substantially between individuals, but always contained upper fields immediately touching lower visual field V 2. This region appears to vary even more between species.

This review addresses {{the urgent need}} to quantitatively define proglacial systems {{not only in terms}} of spatial extent but also in terms of functional processes. It firstly provides a critical appraisal of prevailing conceptual models of proglacial systems, and uses this to justify compiling data on rates of landform change in terms of planform, horizontal motion, elevation changes and sediment budgets. These data permit us to produce novel <b>summary</b> conceptual <b>diagrams</b> that consider proglacial landscape evolution in terms of a balance of longitudinal and lateral water and sediment fluxes. Throughout, we give examples of newly emerging datasets and data processing methods because these have the potential to assist with the issues of: (i) a lack of knowledge of proglacial systems within high-mountain, arctic and polar regions, (ii) considerable inter- and intra-catchment variability in the geomorphology and functioning of proglacial systems, (iii) problems with the magnitude of short-term geomorphological changes being at the threshold of detection, (iv) separating short-term variability from longer-term trends, and (v) of the representativeness of plot-scale field measurements for regionalisation and for upscaling. We consider that understanding of future climate change effects on proglacial systems requires holistic process-based modelling to explicitly consider feedbacks and linkages, especially between hillslope and valley-floor components. Such modelling must be informed by a new generation of repeated distributed topographic surveys to detect and quantify short-term geomorphological changes...|$|R
