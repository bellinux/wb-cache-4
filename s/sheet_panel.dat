This paper reports a new surface strain measurement system based on use of a laser digitizer attached to a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM). A Forming Limit Diagram is automatically generated. The thickness strain is calculated, and displayed as a color shaded part surface image. There is a very good agreement with a dial gauge measurement of thickness...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} disclosed here is {{a method}} for forming and curing an intricate structure of criss-crossing composite stringers and frames that are bonded to a skin panel. A structure constructed {{in accordance with the}} invention would be well-suited for use as a portion of an aircraft fuselage, a boat hull, or the like. The method is preferably practiced by applying uncured composite stringers to an uncured composite <b>sheet</b> <b>panel.</b> This is followed by placing cured frames crosswise over the stringers. The frames have openings at the locations where they intersect with the stringers which enables the frames to come into direct contact with the skin along most of their length. During the forming and curing process, the stringers are covered with a plurality of cauls, and the entire assembly of skin panel, stringers, frames and cauls is subjected to a vacuum bagging and curing process. The cauls serve to maintain both part shape and to control the flow of resin within the stringers as they are cured. Further, they probably eliminate the need for intermediate protective materials between the vacuum bag and the stringers...|$|E

40|$|A {{rotorcraft}} roof {{sandwich panel}} has been redesigned to optimize sound power transmission loss (TL) and minimize structure-borne sound for frequencies between 1 and 4 kHz where gear meshing {{noise from the}} transmission has {{the most impact on}} speech intelligibility. The roof section, framed by a grid of ribs, was originally constructed of a single honeycomb core/composite face <b>sheet</b> <b>panel.</b> The original panel has coincidence frequencies near 700 Hz, leading to poor TL across the frequency range of 1 to 4 kHz. To quiet the panel, the cross section was split into two thinner sandwich subpanels separated by an air gap. The air gap was sized to target the fundamental mass-spring-mass resonance of the double panel system to less than 500 Hz. The panels were designed to withstand structural loading from normal rotorcraft operation, as well as 'man-on-the-roof' static loads experienced during maintenance operations. Thin layers of VHB 9469 viscoelastomer from 3 M were also included in the face sheet ply layups, increasing panel damping loss factors from about 0. 01 to 0. 05. Measurements in the NASA SALT facility show the optimized panel provides 6 - 11 dB of acoustic transmission loss improvement, and 6 - 15 dB of structure-borne sound reduction at critical rotorcraft transmission tonal frequencies. Analytic panel TL theory simulates the measured performance quite well. Detailed finite element/boundary element modeling of the baseline panel simulates TL slightly more accurately, and also simulates structure-borne sound well...|$|E
40|$|Dewfall occurs over {{a season}} of nine months in coastal arid {{district}} of Kutch. Quantity too is appreciable. A research program has been started to develop efficient passive condensers to harvest dew {{and use it as}} a supplementary source of drinking water which is scarce in the area. A passive condenser is a device that cools itself at night by radiative exchange with clear sky. Under favorable conditions condenser may become colder than the dew point of surrounding humid air and attract condensation. Condensers need to be inexpensive, compact and high yielding. We report in this paper, comparative dew yield of condensers made from six different materials including, aluminum sheet, galvanized iron sheet and polyethylene mixed with titanium oxide and barium sulfate, polyethylene, fiber reinforced plastic plain and corrugated. A test condenser is a panel 1 X 1 m in size and 25 mm thick. Top surface is made of the material being tested for condensation.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade a growing {{economic}} literature {{has been devoted to}} the relationship between firm organisation and performance. Empirical analyses mainly focus on the relationship between human resources management and firm performance, neglecting the role played by organisational designs. The aim {{of this paper is to}} integrate the analysis of this relationship and verify the extent to which it is relevant for Italian firms. The data set, for a sample of manufacturing firms located in Lombardy, is composed of a cross-section survey information on workplace organisation and a balance <b>sheet</b> <b>panel.</b> We confirm the major results of studies carried out in other countries, namely: practices appear in clusters, have positive effects on productivity and are favoured by high skills. Moreover we find that a flat hierarchical structure is a condition "sine qua non" for some practices to be implemented and become productive; however, practices like the degree of autonomy of the team, consultation, information sharing, selective hiring and cognitive training are productive only if the horizontal structure is accompanied by good industrial relations. The latter appears to be one of the complementary conditions for radical reorganisation leading to a flat structure and a consequent empowerment of human resources. The road of internal firm flexibility appears to be a strong source of productivity, able to fully exploit the potential of new, more complex and versatile equipments based on investments in advanced manufacturing and in the so-called "general purpose technologies". Policy implications in terms of diffusion of workplaces re-engineering are derived and discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} industry, especially aviation, pays {{special attention}} to vehicle weight because lower weight means lower fuel consumption and in turn lower environmental pollution. Not only light metals like aluminium and magnesium alloys or titanium and its alloys are {{of interest in the}} transport industry but also new production technologies are taken into consideration as factors decreasing structure weight. Sheet metal forming offers light and strong components, therefore monolithic e. g. casting components are often replaced by drawn parts made of sheet metals. Forming large panels of thin sheets, especially hard-to-deform sheets with a high susceptibility to spring back, is a huge challenge. Forming both aluminium and titanium alloy sheets as well as nickel based steel sheets, which are the main structural materials in aviation, is difficult. Titanium, particularly titanium alloys, in comparison to steel and aluminium has a much more beneficial specific strength (strength-to-weight ratio) therefore it is used where high mechanical strength and low weight of the construction are especially essential. However, there are many technological problems, such as: poor drawability, high spring back and low tribological properties that have to be overcome in cold sheet-titanium forming. In the paper, numerical analysis of forming a part of a large <b>sheet</b> <b>panel</b> will be presented. The numerical simulation will be performed using the PamStamp program specially dedicated to sheet-metal forming. The program is based on the finite element method (FEM). The stress and strain distributions in the analysed part will be presented. The effect of the blank-holder force and frictional coefficient on the forming process will be studied. The quality of the obtained drawn part will be assessed based on the correctness of its shape and dimensions with reference ones, {{as well as on the}} thinning of the drawn part material...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is {{on the effects of}} specific employer characteristics on wages and wage rigidity and how these characteristics enter the wage-setting process. The dissertation includes an introductory chapter and five separate essays. The introduction provides motivation, background on the main keywords and an overview of the thesis. Chapters two and three study how internal references affect wages and wage rigidity from a theoretical perspective. The fourth chapter estimates the effect of firm size on wages in the Finnish labor market. Chapter five develops on the preceding and analyses how profit sharing schemes affect the firm size premium. Chapter six studies how internal references can induce profit sharing and wage rigidity from an empirical perspective. Chapter two analyses how fairness considerations of workers affect the union wagesetting process and ultimately on wages, employment and wage rigidity. Fairness is modeled as internal reference where workers compare wages to firm productivity respectively profitability. If the internal reference is high relative to the outside option, wage pressure results through a productivity/profitability premium as well as real wage rigidity. The third chapter reviews the core research on internal references and wage rigidity. With one exception it suggests that internal references unambiguously increase wage rigidity. In contrast, this chapter provides analytical proofs, calibration results and impulse response functions which show that the effect is ambiguous. The effect of the internal reference relative to the external reference determines whether wage rigidity increases or decreases. Chapter four explores the relationship between wages and firm size in the Finnish labor market. Using a large register data set the effect of firm size is found to be negligible after controlling for a large set of worker and firm characteristics and across different identification strategies. Chapter five analyzes the interaction of the firm size wage premium and profit sharing schemes. A simple theoretical analysis shows that the firm-size wage premium decreases in the presence of profit sharing. Using a rich linked employer-employee data set the empirical analysis shows that besides profit sharing, assortative matching and monopsony behavior decrease the firm size premium. The sixth chapter analyses the connection between profit sharing and wage rigidity where profits per worker are measured directly through the balance <b>sheet</b> <b>panel.</b> Profit endogeneity is accounted for by instrumentation as well as the self-selection of firms in different categories of profitability. Profits are shared if positive or increasing while there is no downward adjustment of wages if profits are negative or decreasing. This finding suggests that profits per worker function as internal reference...|$|E

Stretch {{forming process}} is {{commonly}} used in the aircraft industry for the manufacturing of large <b>sheet</b> <b>panels.</b> The success {{of this process is}} highly dependent on the tool motions during forming.

For this purpose, realistic finite element model (FEM) of the process is established. Material characterization and friction tests of mostly used aluminum alloys are conducted for input to the model. In order to improve the model and validate the numerical results, experimental work is performed in which the deformation of the sheet is measured optically...|$|R
