5|$|In 2010, {{writer and}} {{researcher}} Bea Uusma at Karolinska institutet, Sweden, rejected {{the theory that}} larvae of Trichinella spiralis killed the expedition members. After examining the men's clothes, <b>she</b> <b>concluded</b> that at least Strindberg was killed by polar bears.|$|E
5|$|From Pezuelas {{the family}} moved to Mirasol, also in Lares, where Gonzalo Lebrón {{administered}} an hacienda owned by Emilio Vilellas. There she received a better education, attending a local public school. When Lebrón completed the sixth grade she attended the Segunda Unidad Rural, a middle school located in Bartolo, an adjacent barrio. <b>She</b> <b>concluded</b> her formal public school education in the eighth grade.|$|E
5|$|Curie's {{systematic}} studies {{included two}} uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite). Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was {{four times as}} active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. <b>She</b> <b>concluded</b> that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium. She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. Pierre was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it {{that he decided to}} drop his work on crystals and to join her.|$|E

5|$|During Franklin's administration, Eleanor {{became an}} {{important}} connection to the African-American population {{in the era of}} segregation. Despite the President's desire to placate Southern sentiment, Eleanor was vocal in her support of the civil rights movement. After her experience with Arthurdale and her inspections of New Deal programs in Southern states, <b>she</b> <b>concluded</b> that New Deal programs were discriminating against African-Americans, who received a disproportionately small share of relief moneys. Eleanor became one of the only voices in the Roosevelt White House insisting that benefits be equally extended to Americans of all races.|$|E
5|$|Levin was {{commissioned}} by the BBC to visit musical festivals around the world, broadcasting a series of talks about them. Together with Stassinopoulos, he visited festivals in Britain, Ireland, continental Europe and Australia. He later wrote a book, Conducted Tour (1982) on the same subject. By {{the time it was}} published he and Stassinopoulos were no longer together. At the age of 30, she remained deeply in love with him but longed to have children; Levin never wanted to marry or be a father. <b>She</b> <b>concluded</b> that she must break away, and moved to New York in 1980.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 1892, Bennington was {{transferred}} to the South Atlantic Squadron and cruised South American waters until 19 July. Setting out from Bahia, Brazil, the gunboat visited Spanish and Italian ports during the 400thanniversary celebration of Columbus' voyage to the western hemisphere. <b>She</b> <b>concluded</b> the European portion of those festivities on 18 February 1893 when she departed Cadiz, with a replica of Columbus’s caravel Pinta in tow for Cuba. After stops in the Canary Islands, the Netherlands West Indies, and Havana, the gunboat arrived back in the United States at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 26 March.|$|E

5|$|Journal The Library Quarterly {{published}} an article by Eliza T. Dresang which classed Not in Front of the Children as an effective treatise on the harmful to minors doctrine. Dresang wrote that Heins had successfully shown that this doctrine, which served as the core basis for legislation including the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), was demonstrably impossible to prove. <b>She</b> <b>concluded</b> that Heins concisely argued censorship of works from the reach of children can have negative impacts on their level of innovation, healthy mental growth, and adaptive abilities. Writing in English Journal, Tonya Perry discussed the work and emphasized that if the motivation behind children's education was to produce independent critical thinkers, {{it was necessary to}} extend the limits of censorship.|$|E
5|$|She {{observed}} {{the effects of}} the transposition of Ac and Ds by the changing patterns of coloration in maize kernels over generations of controlled crosses, and described {{the relationship between the two}} loci through intricate microscopic analysis. <b>She</b> <b>concluded</b> that Ac controls the transposition of the Ds from chromosome9, and that the movement of Ds is accompanied by the breakage of the chromosome. When Ds moves, the aleurone-color gene is released from the suppressing effect of the Ds and transformed into the active form, which initiates the pigment synthesis in cells. The transposition of Ds in different cells is random, it may move in some but not others, which causes color mosaicism. The size of the colored spot on the seed is determined by stage of the seed development during dissociation. McClintock also found that the transposition of Ds is determined by the number of Ac copies in the cell.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. <b>She</b> <b>concluded</b> that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
50|$|While visiting Eastern European {{countries}} like Romania and Bulgaria Drakulić sees {{the degradation of}} national infrastructure, such as sewage systems. This decline, <b>she</b> <b>concludes,</b> {{is due in part}} to a post-communist mentality.|$|R

5|$|When Antoine was alive, many {{observers}} {{thought that the}} healings he obtained resulted to suggestion only, and Dr. Schuind, who wrote two articles in The Meuse (La Meuse) on the subject at the time, criticized the lack of control and vague diagnostics surrounding these healings. Sociologist Anne-Cécile Bégot considered the Antoinist healing of the first decades a form of protest against (1) the efficiency of medicine, (2) the traditional representation of disease—the real healing can be attained only through {{a new approach to}} the disease, which is never considered a particular misfortune and thus is not reduced to its biological dimension—and (3) the management of disease—sick are always responsible for their own illness. However, <b>she</b> <b>concluded</b> that this protest has evolved throughout time as (1) the disease is now represented on an endogenous etiological model, which indicates a process of individualization of the religion, and (2) the personal real-life experience is more presented as the cause of the disease than the relation to the global society.|$|E
5|$|Cottage gardens, {{which emerged}} in Elizabethan times, {{appear to have}} {{originated}} as a local source for herbs and fruits. One theory is that they arose out of the Black Death of the 1340s, when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages with personal gardens. According to the late 19th-century legend of origin, these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages, {{to provide them with}} food and herbs, with flowers planted in for decoration. Helen Leach analysed the historical origins of the romanticised cottage garden, subjecting the garden style to rigorous historical analysis, along with the ornamental potager and the herb garden. <b>She</b> <b>concluded</b> that their origins were less in workingmen's gardens in the 19th century and more in the leisured classes' discovery of simple hardy plants, in part through the writings of John Claudius Loudon. Loudon helped to design the estate at Great Tew, Oxfordshire, where farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a small garden—about an acre—where they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens.|$|E

25|$|Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf {{had ordered}} an {{investigation}} into whether the covert creation of TIGRIS was legal and whether the agency is needed for Swiss law enforcement. <b>She</b> <b>concluded</b> that TIGRIS is not needed when she had announced the investigation.|$|E
25|$|Then {{apart from}} those {{domestic}} legal hurdles, {{there are numerous}} international regulations and treaties to be negotiated {{in the case of}} a Mars Sample Return, especially those relating to environmental protection and health. <b>She</b> <b>concluded</b> that the public of necessity has a significant role to play in the development of the policies governing Mars Sample Return.|$|E
25|$|Massare {{also tried}} to compare the speeds of plesiosaurs {{with those of the}} two other main sea reptile groups, the Ichthyosauria and the Mosasauridae. <b>She</b> <b>concluded</b> that plesiosaurs were about twenty percent slower than {{advanced}} ichthyosaurs, which employed a very effective tunniform movement, oscillating just the tail, but five percent faster than mosasaurids, which were assumed to swim with an inefficient anguilliform, eel-like, movement of the body.|$|E
50|$|Bim's {{breakdown}} {{at the end}} of {{the book}} results in remarkable clarity of thought. In this insight, <b>she</b> <b>concludes</b> that the bond of family is greater than any other, that she felt their pains, and that she couldn’t live without them.|$|R
50|$|In Woman's Evolution, Reed {{asks what}} {{anthropology}} {{can tell us}} about social evolution. <b>She</b> <b>concludes</b> that social organization was created out of the mother-child relationship - initially as a matrilineal clan system, long before patriarchal families became the norm (page xiii).|$|R
50|$|In {{a review}} for AllMusic, Heather Phares felt the album {{followed}} {{the same pattern of}} his other Christmas albums with his usual funk music and social commentary lyrics; <b>she</b> <b>concludes</b> that the album is festive fun, but not up the standard of his best work.|$|R
25|$|When {{asked about}} the 1992 film A League of Their Own, a fictionalized account of {{activities}} in the AAGPBL created by Penny Marshall, Lee said the film was about 70% accurate. In real life, the managers never entered the women's dressing rooms, she mused. It {{was a time when}} women took over men's positions as they went off to war, not only in the field of manufacturing, but on the field of dreams, <b>she</b> <b>concluded.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Félix {{traveled}} to Argentina, where she filmed La pasión desnuda of the Argentine filmmaker Luis César Amadori. In {{the same year}} Félix returned to Mexico. <b>She</b> <b>concluded</b> her working relationship with Cesáreo González with the film Camelia, filmed in her native country. Her stay in Mexico was mainly based on her marriage to the actor and singer Jorge Negrete (her former film rival), and with whom she filmed El rapto, directed by Emilio Fernández, Negrete's last film.|$|E
25|$|Lead {{prosecutor}} Marcia Clark {{published a}} book about the case titled Without a Doubt (1998). Her book recounts the trial proceedings, from jury selection to final summation. <b>She</b> <b>concluded</b> that nothing could have saved her case, given the defense's strategy of highlighting racial issues related to Simpson and the LAPD, and the predominance of blacks on the jury. In Clark's opinion, the prosecution's factual evidence, particularly the DNA, should have easily convicted Simpson. That it did not, she says, attests to a judicial system compromised by issues of race and celebrity.|$|E
5000|$|Michelle {{claims that}} Ruth {{did not learn}} from the two-week stay at the Handyman Rehabilitation Centre - except being a further danger to herself from doing electrical. <b>She</b> <b>concludes</b> by saying {{that she would never}} look at a shed in the same way again.|$|R
50|$|Hannah Arendt's seminal work, The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), {{describes}} and {{analyzes the}} two major totalitarian movements of the twentieth century, Nazism and Communism. <b>She</b> <b>concludes</b> that both Nazism and Communism were totalitarian movements that sought to eliminate all restraints upon {{the power of the}} State.|$|R
40|$|Apart from {{discussing}} {{the curriculum and}} the social relevance of the subject ‘German language and culture’, Delhey focuses on its raison d’être, also as ‘Auslandsgermanistik’. <b>She</b> <b>concludes</b> her article by referring to a pilot project for a master course ‘Niederlande/ -Deutschlandstudien’ at the Radboud University Nijmegen...|$|R
