Five air traffic control notification designs were evaluated {{in their ability to}} capture attention during an ongoing <b>supervisory</b> <b>task,</b> as well as their impact on the primary task. A range of performance measures, eye-tracking and subjective reports showed that colour, even animated, was less effective than movement, and notifications sometimes went unnoticed. Designs that drew attention to the notified aircraft by a pulsating box, concentric circles or the opacity of the background resulted in faster perception and no missed notifications. However, the latter two designs were intrusive and impaired primary task performance, while the simpler animated box captured attention without an overhead cognitive cost. These results highlight the need for a holistic approach to evaluation, achieving a balance between the benefits for one aspect of performance against the potential costs for another. Practitioner summary: We performed a holistic examination of air traffic control notification designs regarding their ability to capture attention during an ongoing <b>supervisory</b> <b>task.</b> The combination of performance, eye-tracking and subjective measurements demonstrated that the best design achieved a balance between attentional power and the overhead cognitive cost to primary task performance...|$|E

40|$|The Discrete Event Systems (DES) {{theory of}} {{supervisory}} and {{state feedback control}} offers many advantages for implementing supervisory systems. Algorithmic concepts have been introduced {{to assure that the}} supervising algorithms are correct and meet the specifications. It is often assumed that the supervisory specifications are invariant or, at least, until a given <b>supervisory</b> <b>task</b> is completed. However, there are many practical applications where the supervising specifications update at real time. For example, in a Reconfigurable Discrete Event System (RDES) architecture, a bank of supervisors is defined to accommodate each identified operational condition or different supervisory specifications. This adaptive supervisory control system changes the supervisory configuration to accept coordinating commands or to adjust for changes in the controlled process. This paper addresses reconfiguration at the supervisory level of hybrid systems along with a RDES underlying architecture. It reviews the state-based supervisory control theory and extends it to the paradigm of RDES and in view of process control applications. The paper addresses theoretical issues with a limited number of practical examples. This control approach is particularly suitable for hierarchical reconfigurable hybrid implementations...|$|E

This new Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will divide the European Central Bank (ECB) tasks into a monetary function and a supervisory function. Hereby the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of all Member States of the euro zone form the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The debate involving the ECB independence and its new integrated <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks</b> alongside monetary policy raises a number of questions. This particularly relates to central bank independence, since the possibility of trade-offs between monetary policy and <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks</b> could lead to conflicts of objectives. Hence, reputational risks are significant challenges and threats, which need to be overcome. Moreover, when executing the two tasks during crisis situations within the euro zone, the ECB must have a high incentive to improve its accountability practise towards the European public to strengthen its credibility. Therefore, the existing accountability framework of the ECB must be critically reviewed. Thus the ECB could take certain extra measures to maintain its high standard of accountability...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this short essay is to clarify the purpose of and issues {{surrounding}} the variant of educational supervision known as self-supervision. Educational supervision usually {{takes the form of}} individual supervision, team supervision, or group supervision. The self-supervision investigated here is a special form of individual supervision. Individual supervision is usually carried out by two people―a single supervisor and a single supervisee. With self-supervision, however, the instructor has a dual role, playing the parts of both supervisor and supervisee. Self-supervision, in short, is characterized {{by the fact that the}} instructor takes the initiative,organizes his or her supervision by himself or herself,and conducts an internal dialogue regarding own work performance. The issue thus becomes ａ matter of refashioning <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks</b> so that they encourage, assist, and enable ａ single instructor to play this dual role, to develop an ability to self-reflect in order to carry out this internal dialogue regarding own work performance, and to encourage him or her to make better classes.

Grounded in the basic theories that make self-supervision possible, l then identify the objectives of selfしsupervisionand explore examples of <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks</b> developed with the goal of achieving internal dialogue...|$|R
40|$|Practical {{approach}} to modelling and controlling stick-slip oscillations in oilwell drillstrings Eva María Navarro-López and Rodolfo Suárez Abstract — Stick-slip friction-induced oscillations appearing in oilwell drillstrings {{are a source}} of failures which reduce penetration rates and increase drilling operation costs. For this reason, a major problem to solve is modelling the drillstring torsional behaviour and proposing control solutions to help reduce stick-slip phenomenon. This paper is focused on both problems. On the one hand, it presents dynamic drillstring models in order to reproduce stick-slip vibrations under different operating conditions. The model used for the torque on the bit is the main difference with respect to other models proposed in the literature. On the other hand, some experience-based control estrategies are evaluated in order to reduce stick-slip oscillations. These estrategies will use the angular velocity at the drillstring upper part, the torque on the bit and the weight on the bit, proved to have a key importance in the reduction of drillstring torsional vibrations. The control approach followed is a decentralized one, i. e., the angular velocity at the top end of the drillstring and the bit velocity are controlled separately. The <b>supervisory</b> <b>task</b> is made by the driller. I...|$|E
40|$|We derive {{the optimal}} principal-supervisor-agent {{relationship}} in an incomplete contract setting. We show that while having a three-layer structure with full separation of tasks has no efficiency consequence under a complete contract, it becomes crucial under an incomplete contract {{and can even}} lead to a result of irrelevance of the contractual incompleteness. When {{it is not possible}} to achieve this outcome, managers non-compliance arises as equilibrium behaviour despite the presence of complying supervisors. However, although always more efficient relative to a bilateral structure, the three-layer structure is prone to collusion and renegotiation. We show that the response to such drawback is to involve financially the supervisor into the venture, with the extent of the participation depending on how costly it is to collude and renegotiate the contract terms. Last, we derive the welfare properties of the various contract forms showing that they depend on the relative scarcity of each form of financing (monitoring/non monitoring), on transaction costs of collusion and on the distribution of cash flows relative to the project size. This allows us to derive the conditions for the emergence of a bilateral structure in which the financing and <b>supervisory</b> <b>task</b> are centralised on to the same subject and to argue that riskier firms, with high risk of collusive behaviour, are more likely to be financed by a single monitoring lender and thus face a higher cost of credit. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: As {{advanced}} {{mobile technology}} becomes more widespread, the impacts on professional environments {{and on the}} personal lives of individual users continue to increase. Devices, such as smart cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and laptop computers can free their owners {{of the need to}} remain close to a wired information system infrastructure that is provided in a stationary office environment, and provide the opportunity to perform tasks {{in a wide variety of}} use contexts. With changes in use context, however, come changes in requirements, such as the need to limit weight and size of a device. In order to achieve success in the form of adoption, use, and positive impacts on user performance, a thorough understanding is needed about the functional and non-functional technology requirements of mobile professionals. In this paper, we summarize the results of a series of research studies that we conducted to explore the technology requirements of mobile professionals. The research studies included a content analysis of online user reviews, two empirical surveys, and a series of user interviews. Our research findings indicate that (1) user-perceived technology maturity is a critical factor to explain and predict the use of mobile technology by mobile professionals; (2) mobile technology needs to be available in a broad variety of use-situations; (3) users require basic communication and productivity-related functionality, in particular to support non-routine and <b>supervisory</b> <b>task</b> profiles; and (4) mobile technology can have considerable impacts on the job performance and on the personal lives of its users.

40|$|Supervision {{is often}} viewed {{as an adjunct to}} many other {{academic}} and administrative responsibilities. The underlying values that act as a bedrock to Western culture are manifested in the traditions and protocols of what is considered to be good doctoral research. We often overlook that some of these values have been handed down as philosophies over the centuries (Tarnas 1991; Mahoney 1991; Scruton 1997). The same values are informally accessible to supervisors who have been trained and who supervise within the Western culture. When the <b>supervisory</b> <b>task</b> includes offshore supervision, and especially in cultures that are dramatically different across several dimensions, then she needs to articulate her home culture’s embedded values and traditions in order to place them alongside those of the student. Abilities such as standing back and taking a detached view of the (in this case) Western culture, together with learning and embracing other cultures as they enter the supervisory scene are necessary before synergies can be (if they are to be) found. Preparing the student entails encouraging a degree of self-awareness so that personal characteristics can be mapped against those likely to be found within the research context. This is particularly so when the research entails substantial researcher/respondent interaction. The concept of relationship is very different across cultures and this can be problematic when a functional approach is taken to the supervision task. A key role for supervisors is to help decide whether an instrument (such as questionnaire) that is constructed in one culture can be meaningfully employed in another. Here the supervisor can draw on various techniques, such as de-centering, to establish how much meaning is lost when a question has been made culturally intelligible and acceptable...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis reports an {{empirical}} {{study of how}} ten remedial teachers or special remedial teachers, all women, encountered reality as supervisors or tutors in schools during the 1990 s. The study sought to define the conditions for supervision and tutoring in the remedial-teaching function. Data was collected in two steps. The preparatory step consisted of a scrutiny of Report DsU 1986 : 13 on the modified remedial-teacher function, and perusal of the referees’ comments thereon. The second step consisted ofinterviews with all ten participants three years after their training as supervisors/tutors at the Stockholm Institute of Education. Neither in the above Report nor in the referees’ comments was supervision defined or discussed. Despite this resistance, supervision is required by the macro level for the modified remedial-teacher function. Regarding the micro-level situation for supervising in school, two themes were distinguished: an organisational theme and a legitimacy theme. The informants saw school management, the organisation’s pre-understanding of supervision and the profession’s continual adaptation to areas of knowledge not possessed by teachers as important aspects. The legitimacy theme expresses how differentiation of the <b>supervisory</b> <b>task</b> and the design of teaching posts influence the implementation. The supervision/tutoring examined here is described through six experiential themes: the dialogical here-and-now-theme, the relational theme, the didactic ”technical” theme, the reflective and self-fostering theme, the change theme and the leadership theme. Remedial-educational supervision {{as described in the}} study appears as vertical but does not extend to the depth of therapeutic intervention. It is seen as an ethical act where consideration or recognition, rather than care, is a distinctive feature. Care may represent ”tacit” gender-loaded knowledge and needs to be discussed in educational contexts where supervision or tutoring is included in the special-remedial-teacher function...|$|E
40|$|Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMSs) have {{provided}} a means for efficient and reliable automation of batch manufacturing. The purpose of the proposed {{study was to explore}} human supervisory capabilities in controlling a FMS in order to plan the future job design of supervisory controllers of these systems. Two theoretical frameworks were incorporated into the proposed study in order to evaluate human control capabilities. One of these was reflected in task conditions characterized by hypothetically distinct dimensions of the mental workload construct. The second framework consisted of a two-stage sequential decision making model that had intrinsic to it the imposition on the human of a relatively well-defined locus of control. In addition, the usefulness of decision support aimed at enhancing human pattern-recognition capabilities was explored by making a graphical display of the FMS available under certain task conditions. ^ An experiment was performed employing a real-time interactive simulation model of a FMS. Through a set of menus, 12 subjects were able to obtain information from and execute control actions to the system. Subjects performed the <b>supervisory</b> <b>task</b> for seven one-hour sessions, and were instructed to optimize a set of criteria related to FMS performance. ^ Results indicated that the human appeared better at controlling the FMS under task conditions characterized by an externally induced workload (i. e., increased activity within the FMS) compared to conditions where the workload was more internally induced (i. e., brought about by requiring the human to optimize an additional criterion). Under conditions where breakdowns occurred in the human 2 ̆ 7 s interface to the FMS, performance improved when the human adopted a conservative response strategy characterized by lower levels in the locus of information acquisition and control. Additionally {{it was found that the}} particular graphics that was made available generally did not prove very effective as a decision-support device. Evidence demonstrated that when graphical information was made available in addition to the alphanumeric information that was present in the menus, the relative usefulness of each type of information depended on whether well-defined or more generalized criteria were being optimized. ...|$|E

40|$|With {{advanced}} autonomy, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations {{will likely}} be conducted by single operators controlling multiple UAVs. As operator attention is divided across multiple <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks,</b> {{there is a need}} to support the operator's awareness of the state of the tasks for safe and effective task management. This research explores enhancing audio cues of UAV interfaces for this futuristic control of multiple UAVs by a single operator. This thesis specifically assesses the value of continuous and discrete audio cues as indicators of course-deviations or late-arrivals to targets for UAV missions with single and multiple UAVs. In particular, this thesis addresses two questions: (1) when compared with discrete audio, does continuous audio better aid human supervision of UAV operations, and (2) is the effectiveness of the discrete or continuous audio support dependent on operator workload? An experiment was carried out on the Multiple Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle Experiment (MAUVE) test bed with 44 military participants. Specifically, two continuous audio alerts were mapped to two human <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks</b> within MAUVE. These continuous alerts were tested against single beep discrete alerts. The results show that the use of the continuous audio alerts enhances a single operator's performance in monitoring single and multiple, semi-autonomous vehicles. The results also emphasize the necessity to properly integrate the continuous audio with other auditory alarms and visual representations in a display, as it is possible for discrete audio alerts to be masked by continuous audio, leaving operators reliant on the visual aspects of the display. by Hudson D.

40|$|Implicit {{leadership}} {{theory is}} {{the set of}} beliefs individuals hold regarding the behaviors characteristic of an effective leader. The present investigation explored these beliefs by developing a model of implicit leadership theory and testing its predictive validity. ^ Subjects generated behaviors which they believed might characterize either an effective or ineffective supervisor. The 24 behaviors most frequently mentioned were used to develop a model of implicit leadership theory. These behaviors were presented to new subjects, who completed a sorting task which provided information about the perceived interrelationships among the supervisory behaviors. Multi-dimensional scaling of subjects 2 ̆ 7 sorting judgments revealed a three-dimensional model. The three dimensions of this model were a task/socioemotional dimension distinguishing <b>supervisory</b> <b>task</b> behaviors from socioemotional behaviors, a participation dimension distinguishing participative behaviors from other supportive behaviors, and a reward dimension separating behaviors dealing with employee motivation from those which did not. ^ The validity of this model was then assessed. Employees (n = 239) at five organizations rated their supervisors on the dimensions of implicit leadership theory and the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ; Stogdill, 1963). Subordinate satisfaction with supervision, job, and coworkers was also assessed. Managerial personnel provided ratings of supervisory effectiveness. Leader behavior was unrelated to leader effectiveness. High levels of subordinate satisfaction with supervision were associated with high ratings of socioemotional and reward behavior on respectively the task/socioemotional and reward dimensions of implicit leadership theory, and with high ratings on the consideration scale of the LBDQ. High levels of subordinate job satisfaction were related to high ratings of task and reward behavior on the task/socioemotional and reward dimensions of implicit leadership theory, and to high ratings on the initiating structure scale of the LBDQ. The reward dimension accounted for variance in satisfaction ratings not explained by the LBDQ. Relationships between the task/socioemotional and reward dimensions of implicit leadership theory and subordinate satisfaction provide some evidence for the validity of implicit leadership theory. ...|$|E
40|$|The American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) {{are pleased}} to {{announce}} the publication of two new versions of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation from our respective organizations. 1 – 3 These revisions were begun independently, dictated both by emerging, new information regarding the topic and the controversy regarding the legitimacy of data from previously published pivotal trials. Accordingly, the leadership of these international organizations {{recognized the importance of}} scientific collaboration and writing committee coordination {{for the benefit of the}} worldwide cardiology community. A joint statement was therefore posted in August 20134 – 6 to indicate that the respective CPGs were under revision and to provide some guidance regarding perioperative beta-blockade therapy in the interim. Since then, the members of both ESC and ACC/AHA guideline writing committees have reviewed the evidence thoroughly and systematically. The writing committees and the two <b>supervisory</b> <b>task</b> force groups decided to analyse separately the evidence about beta-blocker therapy used in the perioperative period and to develop specific treatment recommendations as a first step in the process of revision. After this independent work, the revised recommendations were shared between the two writing committees so that the rationales for any differences in recommendations could be articulated clearly. As a result of this process, we are confident that the evidence base has been objectively reviewed by two independent expert writing committees. The development of the two revised CPGs on perioperative cardiovascular care underscores the benefits of collaboration. Although the writing committees compiled and reviewed the evidence separately, they subsequently came together to validate their analyses, finding that they had both drawn on the same data and reached similar conclusions. Additionally, discussions are ongoing among the ACC, AHA, and ESC about sharing resources related to the systematic review of evidence. The potential advantages of more highly structured joint CPG initiatives are under active consideration. The CPGs on cardiovascular care in the perioperative period represent a fresh and objective review of old and new evidence in this important clinical arena. Features of the CPGs include the latest synthesis of the data on the use of beta-blockers in patients who have taken them chronically, considerations regarding selection of patients who are potential candidates to receive beta-blockers pre-operatively, and guidance regarding how to use this important and powerful class of drugs in the perioperative period. Clinicians will find the recommendations in these revised CPGs useful in their daily work and can be reassured that the recommendations have been vetted thoroughly by the most rigorous scientific process. Furthermore, the recommendations in both documents are fundamentally aligned, so that cardiovascular clinicians worldwide may deliver optimal, standardized care. ...|$|E

50|$|Deeply {{influenced}} by his father's approach to architecture, Jan Utzon {{soon began to}} collaborate with him taking on key <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks</b> in major projects such as the Kuwait National Assembly Building. In many cases, {{it is difficult to}} estimate to division of responsibility in projects undertaken by Utzon Associates where Jan worked both with his father and his brother Kim. These include the Paustian House in Copenhagen and the Skagen Odde Nature Centre in the north of Jutland. Jan also set up his own design office on Funen where he authored many interesting projects. One of his most successful is the Performing Arts Centre in Esbjerg (1997) with its theatre and concert hall combined with the earlier art museum. Its large communal foyer catering both to the concert hall and the museum is particularly appealing and was achieved on a modest budget.|$|R
