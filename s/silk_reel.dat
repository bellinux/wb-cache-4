A_j stands for average agricultural incomes per family and (w^p_j/w_i) for the wage differentials between regions (ken's). [w^p_j is calculated as follows: w^p_j=(Σ__in^i_jw_i-n^p_jw_p) /(Σ__in^i_j-n^p_j), where suffix p denotes "excluding any specific i. "] The term ψ is a shift variable in the above job application equation and supposed further to {{be a function of}} τ^i_j, the familiarity of the applicants in j ken with i ken, and also of θ^i_j, the order of hiring preference to the workers from j ken held by the spinners in i ken. In the proceeding analysis (Obi and Nishikawa, Mita Annals of Economics vol. 4. 1960) the ψ-effect was conveniently called as "distance effect," and identified with the accumulative numbers of in- and out-flows between i and j ken, N^i_j(t) =Σ^^ __ n^i_j(t) [o stands for any basic year]. The N^i_j may be interpreted as a crude index of past history on labor movement between i and j ken. The introduction of N^i_j instead of ψ presents us a sufficiently high and significant multiple correlation; however there still remain some gaps between our understandings and the actual course of events. It is the purpose of this second report to fill these gaps. It is supposed that ψ-ffect is composed of f_i and f_t, which are unspecified factors and represent inter-regional and inter-temporal effect, respectively. logn^i_j=f^i_j+f^i_t+a_ 1 (w^p_j/w_i) +a_ 2 A_j; i-e., a_ 3 ψ=f^i_j+f^i_t. The f^i_j-s and f^i_i-s are estimated from the inflows from j to i. As for i, Aichi (23), Hyogo (28) and Okayama (33) are selected. Our subsequent analysis is to correlate any variables X_q(_i) with f^i_j. The f^i_j-s are 1. positively correlated with M_i, total outflows from j ken, 2. positively correlated with M^i_j, outflows from j to i ken, 3. not significantly correlated with(M_j/P_j), the ratio of outflows to population. The variables M_j, M^i_j and (M_j/P_j) are considered to be alternative Indices of psychological tendencies to move out from the native area. The f^i_j-s are 4. positively correlated with R_j(t), <b>silk</b> <b>reeling</b> outflows from j ken at year t, 5. positively correlated with S_j(t), numbers of <b>silk</b> <b>reeling</b> workers employed in j ken at year t, 6. positively correlated with ΔR_j (5 - 10) and ΔS_j (5 - 10); these are decrements of R_j and S_j from S. 5 (1930) to S. 10 (1935). It is inferred according to Findings 4 ～ 6 that the decreases of job opportunity in <b>silk</b> <b>reeling</b> accerelate the outflows to spinning mills. In this context we are remined that the geographical distributions of these two industries are considerably different. The <b>silk</b> <b>reeling</b> are scattered widely ail over the country and spinning mills concentrated in 4 areas along the coast of Pacific Ocean. This characterizes the scopes of labor mobility of the workers in these industries; that is, the workers in <b>silk</b> <b>reeling</b> moved narrowly, while the workers in spinning mills moved far more long distance. Findings 4 ～ 6 are clearly observed only for inflows to Aichi (i= 23), but not for Hyogo (i= 28) and Okayama (i= 33). This is because both the two industries are highly mixed in Tokai and Tosan District, while in the other areas, the relative weight of <b>silk</b> <b>reeling</b> workers are too low to result in such high and significant correlations. Besides what mentioned above, we have reviewed some case-studies on labor market organization, undertaken by emploment offices nearly at the period in consideration...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. This {{paper is}} part of a larger project that focuses on the {{historical}} sericultural industry of Connecticut, based in the town of Mansfield during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In this paper, I focus on one specific role in the production of raw silk: <b>silk</b> <b>reeling.</b> In the heyday of its sericultural industry, Mansfield was situated in Windham County, Connecticut. The particular perspective that I bring to this study of <b>silk</b> <b>reeling</b> is one shaped by my experience as an anthropologist who has conducted research on another sericultural area: Shunde County near Guangzhou (Canton) in South China. In both Windham and Shunde counties, sericulture was practiced more intensively than elsewhere in the United States and China, respectively. This fact in itself seems to invite cross-cultural comparative analysis. In the discussion that follows, I use the South China case as a lens through which to examine the development of sericulture and the practice of <b>silk</b> <b>reeling</b> in Mansfield. Of particular interest to me is the issue of the cross-cultural transmission of a skill: Is it possible to learn the highly skilled role of <b>silk</b> <b>reeling</b> from a printed manual? In Mansfield, and in New England more generally, instructional manuals, some with illustrations, and all translations from the original languages, were the means to learn an industry and a skill. I return to this interesting issue later in the paper. Mansfield Sericulture. Mansfield, Connecticut, occupies an important position in the history of silk production in the United States. It figures prominently both in the practice of “sericulture” (or raw silk culture) in this country, as well as in the development of the technology of industrialized silk thread and textile production. Mansfield was an early site of experimentation in sericulture, which was established in the 1760 ’s. Local families cultivated mulberry trees for their leaves, which they fed to the silkworms that they raised at home in attics and sheds. Each family nurtured hundreds of silkworms at once across the several weeks of their lifecycle, from newly hatched eggs, through several moultings, to mature silkworms, which at last spun their cocoons, the goal of the family enterprise. Cocoons were unwound or “reeled” by hand, by women in the family, to produce filaments of raw silk, the basic component of silk thread. Filaments from several cocoons were wound off together at hearthside onto the common reel. Later, the <b>reeled</b> <b>silk</b> underwent further processing by twisting it into thread, which was wound onto a “wool wheel” and measured off into skeins of standard length as “sewing silk. ” This was the most common product of the Mansfield sericultural industry. Some of it was refined still further, twisted into a denser product called “silk twist. ...|$|R

40|$|Regional {{differences}} in banking integration determined how Japan s Great Recession after 1990 {{spread across the}} country. We explain these differences {{with the emergence of}} <b>silk</b> <b>reeling</b> as the main export industry after Japan s opening to trade in the 19 th century. The silk-exporting prefectures developed a system of export finance centered on local, cooperative banks that preserved their dominant local position long after the decline of the silk industry. Our findings suggest that different pathways to financial development can lead to long-term {{differences in}} de facto financial integration, even if there are no formal barriers to capital mobility between regions...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the cultivation of vines, {{from the middle of}} the century the cultivation of mulberry trees had spread enormously in the region, and was planted on the edge of the fields, so as not to supplant other crops. The mulberry trees were used to feed the silk worms, which were given by the owner to the tenant farmers. Mostly women and children worked on the breeding of silk worms. The explosion of silk worm translated as the construction of a textile mill in Baraggia (another being placed in Moncucco), where the first phase of production of <b>silk</b> (<b>reeling)</b> was performed.|$|R
50|$|Over the 19th century, a shift {{occurred}} to rural female labor with guild organized urban-based male labor less important. The global markets for Ottoman goods fell somewhat with certain sectors expanding. However, any changes were compensated {{by an increase}} in domestic consumption and demand. Mechanized production even at its peak remained an insignificant portion of total output. The lack of capital, as {{in other areas of the}} economy, deterred the mechanization of production. Nonetheless, a number of factories did emerge in Istanbul, Ottoman Europe and Anatolia. In the 1830s steam powered <b>silk</b> <b>reeling</b> factories emerged in Salonica, Edirne, West Anatolia and Lebanon.|$|R

40|$|How do {{financial}} {{development and}} financial integration interact? We focus on Japan’s Great Recession after 1990 {{to study this}} question. Regional differences in banking integration affected how the recession spread across the country: financing frictions for credit-dependent firms were more severe in less integrated prefectures, which saw larger decreases in lending by nationwide banks and lower GDP growth. We explain these cross-prefectural differences in banking integration by reference to prefectures’ different historical pathways to financial development. After Japan’s opening to trade in the 19 th century, <b>silk</b> <b>reeling</b> emerged as the main export industry. The <b>silk</b> <b>reeling</b> industry depended heavily on credit for working capital but comprised many small firms that could not borrow directly from larger banks. Instead, silk merchants in Yokohama, the main export hub for silk, provided silk reelers with trade loans. Many regional banks in Japan were founded as local clearing houses for such loans, and regional banks continued to account for above-average shares in lending in the formerly silk-exporting prefectures long after {{the decline of the}} silk industry. Using the cross-prefectural variation in the number of silk filatures in 1895 as an instrument, we confirm that the post- 1990 decline was worse in prefectures where credit constraints were tightened through low levels of banking integration. Our findings suggest that different pathways to financial development can lead to long-term differences in de facto financial integration, even if there are no formal barriers to capital mobility between regions, {{as is the case in}} modern Japan...|$|R
