5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly <b>stable</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> Koole, Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg investigated this by asking Dutch students to rate each {{letter of the}} alphabet, together with some filler questions for distraction, twice within a four-week period. They found that preferences for name letters did not significantly change {{between the first and}} second rating. Hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings remained stable when 164 subjects rated letters seven days in a row.|$|E
5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain <b>stable</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.|$|E

5|$|All {{members of}} a {{resident}} pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and <b>stable</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members. For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently {{in the days following}} a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time. When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{evidence}} that cognitive deficits remain <b>stable</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> is reliable and abundant, {{much of the research}} in this domain focuses on methods to improve attention and working memory. Efforts to improve learning ability in individuals with schizophrenia using a high- versus low-reward condition and an instruction-absent or instruction-present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance, highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase cognitive performance. Training individuals with schizophrenia to alter their thinking, attention, and language behaviors by verbalizing tasks, engaging in cognitive rehearsal, giving self-instructions, giving coping statements to the self to handle failure, and providing self-reinforcement for success, significantly improves performance on recall tasks. This type of training, known as self-instructional (SI) training, produced benefits such as lower number of nonsense verbalizations and improved recall while distracted.|$|E

40|$|Averaging {{theory is}} used to study the {{dynamics}} of dispersive equations taking the nonlinear Klein Gordon equation on the line as a model problem: For approximatively monochromatic initial data of amplitude E, we show that the corresponding solution consists of two non interacting wave packets, each one being described by a nonlinear Schrodinger equation. Such solutions are also proved to be <b>stable</b> <b>over</b> <b>times</b> of order 1 /epsilon(2). We think that this approach puts into a new light the problem of obtaining modulations equations for general dispersive equations. The proof of our results requires a new use of normal forms {{as a tool for}} constructing approximate solutions...|$|R

25|$|Pedophilia emerges {{before or}} during puberty, and is <b>stable</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> It is self-discovered, not chosen. For these reasons, pedophilia has been {{described}} as a disorder of sexual preference, phenomenologically similar to a heterosexual or homosexual sexual orientation. These observations, however, do not exclude pedophilia from the group of mental disorders because pedophilic acts cause harm, and mental health professionals can sometimes help pedophiles to refrain from harming children.|$|E
25|$|In psychology, trait theory (also called dispositional theory) is an {{approach}} {{to the study of}} human personality. Trait theorists are primarily interested in the measurement of traits, which can be defined as habitual patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. According to this perspective, traits are relatively <b>stable</b> <b>over</b> <b>time,</b> differ across individuals (e.g. some people are outgoing whereas others are not), and influence behavior. Traits are in contrast to states which are more transitory dispositions.|$|E

25|$|While {{this was}} taking place, the {{original}} ZETA II proposal {{had been growing}} ever-larger, eventually specifying currents as powerful as the Joint European Torus that was built years later. As it seemed this was beyond the state-of-the-art, the project was eventually cancelled in February 1959. A new proposal soon took its place, the Intermediate-Current Stability Experiment (ICSE). ICSE was designed {{to take advantage of}} further stabilising effects noticed in M-theory, which suggested that very fast pinches would cause the current to flow only in the outer layer of the plasma, which should be much more <b>stable.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>time,</b> this machine grew to be about the same size as ZETA; ICSE had a 6m major diameter and 1m minor diameter, powered by bank of capacitors storing 10MJ at 100kV.|$|E
25|$|One's first {{impressions}} {{are affected by}} {{whether he or she}} is alone or with any number of people. Joint experiences are more globally processed (see global precedence for more on processing), as in collectivist cultures. Global processing emphasizes {{first impressions}} more because the collective first impression tends to remain <b>stable</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> Solo experiences tend to facilitate local processing, causing the viewer to take a more critical look at the target. Thus, individuals {{are more likely to have}} negative first impressions than groups of two or more viewers of the same target. At the same time, individuals are more likely to experience an upward trend over the course of a series of impressions, e.g. individual viewers will like the final episode of a TV season more than the first even if it is really the same quality.|$|E
25|$|Irrevocability principle: The fusion {{approach}} assumes that, once developed, fusion {{will remain}} largely <b>stable</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> This stability persists even in varying situations. Identity fusion theory proposes {{that this is}} due to the strong emotions, beliefs, and intra-relationships experienced by the strongly fused individuals. That is, although the overall fusion of a group of persons may shift in response to powerful situational forces, the rank orderings of individuals within the group will remain stable. Researchers have tested the “once fused, always fused” hypothesis by comparing the temporal stability of fusion-with-country scores for highly fused individuals with those of moderately or weakly fused individuals. The stability coefficients for highly fused participants were significantly higher than the coefficients associated with weakly or moderately fused participants. Even when ostracized strongly fused individuals will go to serious lengths to reaffirm their steadfastness to the group.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a common scale with a <b>stable</b> structure <b>over</b> <b>time</b> to use in repeated measures studies, this study uses information from a large community-based cohort of women. Mental health was assessed at six time points during 21  years, using the Delusions-Symptoms-States Inventory/States of Anxiety and Depression (DSSI/sAD) for 2698 women with mean age of 25. 2  years at baseline. Mokken scale analysis {{is applied to the}} 14 items of DSSI/sAD at each time point, using a hierarchical clustering Algorithm and a Genetic Algorithm. Both algorithms resulted in one Mokken scale at each time point. After excluding items that did not meet the assumptions of Mokken scaling for polytomous data, a single common scale with 10 common items was extracted from scales, which was highly reliable at each time point. This measure with reasonable hierarchy of severity of items (symptoms) has a <b>stable</b> structure <b>over</b> <b>time</b> and can be used to track the changes of women’s mental health <b>over</b> <b>time</b> and analysed via repeated measures analysis.

40|$|The German Federal Government {{has decided}} to {{decrease}} the contribution rate of the statutory unemployment insurance from 4. 2 to 3. 3 per cent of gross wages. The unemployment insurance retards the income loss in times of increasing unemployment, which has a dampening effect on the business cycle. In order not to countervail this effect {{it is necessary to}} hold the contribution rate <b>stable</b> <b>over</b> <b>times</b> with high and low unemployment. Therefore, the budget surplus of the unemployment insurance agency in the current economic upswing is no sufficient argument for a contribution cut. A present reduction of the contribution rate induces the risk of a new contribution rise in the next economic slowdown. It would be better to build up sufficient reserves so that a contribution rise will be avoidable even in times with increasing unemployment. ...|$|R
25|$|The Tripartite {{model of}} {{subjective}} well-being (SWB) {{is a theory}} developed by Diener which describes how people experience {{the quality of their}} lives and includes both emotional reactions and cognitive judgments. Psychologists have defined happiness as a combination of life satisfaction and the relative frequency of positive and negative affect. SWB therefore encompasses moods and emotions as well as evaluations of one's satisfaction with general and specific areas of one's life. Concepts encompassed by SWB include positive and negative affect, happiness, and life satisfaction. Positive psychology is particularly concerned with the study of SWB. SWB tends to be <b>stable</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> and is strongly related to personality traits. There is evidence that health and SWB may mutually influence each other, as good health tends to be associated with greater happiness, and {{a number of studies have}} found that positive emotions and optimism can have a beneficial influence on health.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to assume that {{buildings}} are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively <b>stable</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> This implies {{that there is little}} interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see {{the overwhelming majority of the}} mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. “Building ecology “ is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.|$|E
