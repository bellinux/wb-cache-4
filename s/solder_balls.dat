25|$|It is {{important}} to use solder compatible with both the PCB and the parts used. An example is ball grid array (BGA) using tin-lead <b>solder</b> <b>balls</b> for connections losing their balls on bare copper traces or using lead-free solder paste.|$|E
25|$|Ramp {{is defined}} as the rate of change in {{temperature}} over time, expressed in degrees per second. The most commonly used process limit is 4°C/s, though many component and solder paste manufacturers specify the value as 2°C/s. Many components have a specification where the rise in temperature should not exceed a specified temperature per second, such as 2°C/s. Rapid evaporation of the flux contained in the solder paste can lead to defects, such as lead lift, tombstoning, and <b>solder</b> <b>balls.</b> Additionally, rapid heat can lead to steam generation within the component if the moisture content is high, resulting in the formation of microcracks.|$|E
2500|$|In the soak {{segment of}} the profile, the solder paste {{approaches}} a phase change. The amount of energy introduced to both the component and the PCB approaches equilibrium. [...] In this stage, most of the flux evaporates out of the solder paste. The duration of the soak varies for different pastes. The mass of the PCB is another factor that must be considered for the soak duration. An over-rapid heat transfer can cause solder splattering {{and the production of}} <b>solder</b> <b>balls,</b> bridging and other defects. If the heat transfer is too slow, the flux concentration may remain high and [...] result in cold solder joints, voids and incomplete reflow.|$|E

In this study, the {{back-propagation}} {{neural network}} technology (BPN) is utilized {{to identify the}} shape of the defective <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> of ball grid array (BGA) so as to promote the accuracy of the optical inspection and measurement.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a simple computational {{model for the}} analysis on the <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> shear testing conditions. Both two-dimensional (2 -D) and three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element models are used to investigate the effect of shear ram speed on the <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> shear strength of plastic ball grid array (PBGA) packages.

The computational model is validated by experimental data in terms of load-displacement curves. The results from both testing and modeling indicate that the shear ram speed has a substantial effect on the <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> shear strength.

40|$|Portable electronics, such as notebooks, {{cameras and}} cell phones, {{can be easily}} dropped by our miss handling. To mimic the real dropping, drop tests are usually used to study the dynamic {{response}} of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) {{as well as the}} reliability of the <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> joints in laboratory. The reliability of <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> joints is a critical issue since the whole device may be losing functions or failed by disconnection of one single <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> joint between a chip and a PCB. The main {{purpose of the present study}} is to investigate the dynamic response of PCBs and the failure mechanisms of <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> joints in BGA under board level drop tests with various impact orientations. Impact orientation is an important variable which determines not only the magnitude of the stress/strain but also the dominant stress/strain component in solder joints [1]. Previous studies mainly focused on the drop test with merely one impact orientation [2]. In the present study, the drop impact tests were conducted with four impact orientations. Owing to the lacking of experimental methods/tools for measuring stress/strain of <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> joints, Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to simulate the various drop impact test conditions and to predict the stress, elastic/plastic strain and strain rate fields in the <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> joints array. In the simulation, the drop tests were simulated by commercial FEM software ABAQUS TM -Explicit with an adoption of a novel Input acceleration (Input-G) method [2]. The lead-free solder's rate-dependent material property derived from a Mini-Split Hopkinson Bar technique, which was developed in our laboratory, is applied in the present modeling. After verified by experimental results, all the information on stresses, strains and strain rates are very valuable in investigating the failure mechanisms of solder joints under various impact conditions. For instance, the dominant stress/strain components found from the simulation results can be employed to study the failure mechanisms with different impact orientations; and the strain rate fields in solder joints are used to compare the drop test with our previous study of the single <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> shear impact [4]. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R

Pulsed Nd;YAG laser {{was applied}} to {{investigate}} the bond characteristics of Sn- 3. 5 wt%Ag (hereafter, Sn- 3. 5 Ag) <b>solder</b> <b>ball.</b> The ball diameter is 500 µm, and the UBM (Under Bump Metallurgy) on a FR 4 -PCB consisted of Cu/Ni/Au from bottom to top with thickness of 50 µm/ 25 µm/ 0. 05 µm, respectively.

Laser power was 250 W, and its beam diameter at the focal point was around 250 µm. Experimental results reveal that the <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> showed a good bonded state when the laser energy was in the range between 0. 8 and 1. 0 J. Laser energy lower than 0. 8 J caused non-wetting of the <b>solder</b> <b>ball,</b> and energy higher than 1. 2 J showed crack along the UBM. Microstructure of the laser soldered Sn- 3. 5 Ag was examined with the number of pulse, when the frequency, pulse width and laser energy were fixed at 5 Hz, 20 ms and 0. 8 J, respectively. The IMC (Intermetallic Compound) of Ag 3 Sn in the solder changed from acicular to rod type with increasing laser pulses. Ni 3 Sn 4 was produced between the solder and the UBM, and its thickness increased from 0. 65 to 1. 80 µm with increasing number of pulse from 2 to 4.

With the development of Surface-mount Technology (SMT), the reliability of <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> joints is a critical issue since the whole device may be losing functions or failed by disconnection of one single <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> joint between a chip and a PCB. To mimic the real dropping, drop tests are usually used to study the dynamic response of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) as well as the reliability of the <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> joints in laboratory. In the present thesis, the dynamic responses of the PCB and solder joints are studied by both experiments and Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations with various impact orientations. Although board level drop test {{is one of the}} most useful experiment methods to examine the reliability of solder joints for assembly quality, it is very time consuming. To accelerate the test time for solder joint reliability test, many technologies and tools such as the package level shear/pull tests machines were developed in design and process characterization area. Both the high speed ball shear and pull tests are simulated by ABAQUSTM in the present thesis. Noticed that the strain rates of solder joints in high speed <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> shear/pull tests are very high, the dynamic properties of the lead free solder alloys (SAC 105 & LF 35) are tested by the mini Split Hopkinson Tensile Bar (mSHTB) technique. The lead free solder alloys are found highly rate dependent. Some important aspects (e. g. IMC property, strain rate effect) which may influence the failure mode of the solder joint are discussed. By comparing between the board level reliability test technology and the package level reliability test technology, some differences are discussed with evidence on the strain rates, the stress/strain distribution etc. of the solder joints.
