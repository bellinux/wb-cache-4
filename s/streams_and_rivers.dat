5|$|In {{geographic}} information systems, flow networks (such as the networks showing how water flows {{in a system}} of <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers)</b> are dual to cellular networks describing drainage divides. This duality can be explained by modeling the flow network as a spanning tree on a grid graph of an appropriate scale, and modeling the drainage divide as the complementary spanning tree of ridgelines on the dual grid graph.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Arlene {{combined with a}} non-tropical system caused heavy rainfall across New York, with some locations reporting 6 to 7inches (150 to 175mm) of precipitation in a 2-hour period. The rainfall collected into <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers,</b> with some officials calling it a 1 in 500year flood. The flash flooding caused at least one mudslide, and damaged several roads. The flooding forced at least 20 to evacuate from their homes, and numerous houses were damaged. Strong winds also downed trees and power lines, causing scattered power outages. Damage totaled to $6.5million (2005USD).|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis prefers lowland {{habitats}} (in Switzerland {{it occurs}} up to 275 m a.s.l.) and calcium-rich waters. This small snail inhabits {{the central and}} lower parts of rivers (up to 13 m deep), including in brackish water in tidal rivers of estuaries. It sometimes lives in lakes on unvegetated bottoms. Rarely, it lives in springs (rheocrenes), in ground water, and in caves. For example, in the Åland Islands, Theodoxus fluviatilis was found living in lakes with a pH of 7.8–8.9. In <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers</b> in Ireland, the species lived in water with a pH of 7.0–8.4.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers</b> within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
5|$|Gold strikes {{from the}} mid-19th to early 20thcenturies {{played a major}} role in {{attracting}} settlers to the upper Colorado River basin. In 1859, a group of adventurers from Georgia discovered gold along the Blue River in Colorado and established the mining boomtown of Breckenridge. During 1875, even bigger strikes were made along the Uncompahgre and San Miguel rivers, also in Colorado, and these led to the creation of Ouray and Telluride, respectively. Because most gold deposits along the upper Colorado River and its tributaries occur in lode deposits, extensive mining systems and heavy machinery were required to extract them. Mining remains a substantial contributor to the economy of the upper basin and has led to acid mine drainage problems in some regional <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1967 U.S. recon {{photographs}} uncovered {{an unusual}} sight. POL barrels were spotted {{floating in the}} waters of the Kong River south of Ban Bak, Laos. Soon, PAVN was making use of the Banghiang River which flowed southwestward from the Demilitarized Zone {{all the way to the}} Mekong River, for the same purposes. The watertight drums were launched en masse from tributary streams into the main channel, floated downstream, and were recovered by systems of nets and booms. The Kaman River was added to the system in 1969. By 1970 the North Vietnamese were making intense use of <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers</b> to supplement their logistical route, especially in the rainy season, when the water levels rose and the roadways became impassable mires. During one two and one-half month period during 1969, over 10,000 POL barrels were spotted in the waterways of southeastern Laos.|$|E

5|$|In Florida, nesting {{habitats}} often {{consist of}} mangrove swamps, the shorelines of lakes and rivers, pinelands, seasonally flooded flatwoods, hardwood swamps, and open prairies and pastureland with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are slash pines (Pinus elliottii), longleaf pines (P. palustris), loblolly pines (P. taeda) and cypress trees, {{but for the}} southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used. In Wyoming, groves of mature cottonwoods or tall pines found along <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers</b> are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa) to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland. In Southeast Alaska, Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by hemlocks (Tsuga) at 20%. Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked with fish.|$|E
5|$|In early February 1986 {{ten inches}} (254mm) of rain {{fell on the}} Sacramento region in 11 days, melting the Sierra Nevada snowpack and causing a huge flood to pour down the American River. The 1986 floods {{were some of the}} most severe {{recorded}} in the 20th century; Placer County was quickly designated a Federal Disaster Area. Rampaging <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers</b> incurred some $7.5 million in damages within the county. The rating for Sacramento's levees, supposedly designed to prevent a 125-year flood, was dropped to a 78-year flood in studies conducted after the 1986 event, which suggested that such weather occurred more frequently than previously believed. The floods tore out levees along the Sacramento and Feather Rivers through the Sacramento Valley, and the city of Sacramento was spared by a close margin. Folsom Lake filled to dangerously high levels with runoff from the North, Middle and South Forks of the American River.|$|E
5|$|In most species, the nymphs are herbivores or detritivores, {{feeding on}} algae, diatoms or detritus, {{but in a}} few species, they are predators of chironomid and other small insect larvae and nymphs. Nymphs of Povilla burrow into {{submerged}} wood and {{can be a problem}} for boat owners in Asia. Some are able to shift from one feeding group to another as they grow, thus enabling them to utilise a variety of food resources. They process a great quantity of organic matter as nymphs and transfer a lot of phosphates and nitrates to terrestrial environments when they emerge from the water, thus helping to remove pollutants from aqueous systems. Along with caddisfly larvae and gastropod molluscs, the grazing of mayfly nymphs has {{a significant impact on the}} primary producers, the plants and algae, on the bed of <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers.</b>|$|E

30|$|Water quality {{monitoring}} {{has become a}} subject of concern in marine, <b>stream,</b> <b>and</b> <b>river</b> water due uncontrolled disposal of urban effluents, runoff, atmospheric deposition, municipal, and industrial effluent into these water bodies (Onojake et al. 2011).|$|R
50|$|Discherodontus colemani is {{a species}} of cyprinid fish. It is endemic to Thailand and {{restricted}} to the upper Chao Phraya River basin. It is an uncommon species that inhabits <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>river</b> tributaries, occasionally the mainstreams.|$|R
5|$|Snowfall can be {{beneficial}} to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator, conserving {{the heat of the}} Earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather. Some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring, providing water for crop growth, both directly and via runoff through <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers,</b> which supply irrigation canals. The following are examples of rivers that rely on meltwater from glaciers or seasonal snowpack as an important part of their flow on which irrigation depends: the Ganges, many of whose tributaries rise in the Himalayas and which provide much irrigation in northeast India, the Indus River, which rises in Tibet and provides irrigation water to Pakistan from rapidly retreating Tibetan glaciers, and the Colorado River, which receives much of its water from seasonal snowpack in the Rocky Mountains and provides irrigation water to some 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares).|$|E
5|$|The Morrison Formation is a {{sequence}} of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to radiometric dating, dates from between 156.3mya at its base, and 146.8mya at the top, placing it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. This formation is interpreted as originating in a locally semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin, where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan; it was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers</b> and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania.|$|E
5|$|The South Vietnamese M113s had {{no problem}} {{crossing}} the generally shallow <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers</b> typical of the Mekong Delta, but the heavy 10-ton M113s became bogged down in the deeper Cong Ba Ky Canal, forcing the crews and the infantry company on board to cut down brush and trees and fill the canal until it was shallow enough for the M113s to cross. The rescue operation was further delayed when Ba tried to obtain proper authorization to advance, because he was under orders not to take commands directly from the American advisers. Vann, who was flying above the armored formation, demanded that Ba advance immediately. Ba replied {{that he would not}} take instructions from Americans. When Vann threatened to have Ba shot, he reluctantly continued to advance, although very slowly, toward the entrenched Viet Cong.|$|E
50|$|The rock facies of the Nemegt Formation {{suggest the}} {{presence}} of <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> <b>river</b> channels, mudflats, <b>and</b> shallow lakes.

5|$|The bailey was an {{enclosed}} courtyard overlooked by the motte {{and surrounded by}} a wooden fence called a palisade and another ditch. The bailey was often kidney-shaped to fit against a circular motte, but could be made in other shapes according to the terrain. The bailey would contain a wide number of buildings, including a hall, kitchens, a chapel, barracks, stores, stables, forges or workshops, and was {{the centre of the}} castle's economic activity. The bailey was linked to the motte either by a flying bridge stretching between the two, or, more popularly in England, by steps cut into the motte. Typically the ditch of the motte and the bailey joined, forming a figure of eight around the castle. Wherever possible, nearby <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers</b> would be dammed or diverted, creating water-filled moats, artificial lakes and other forms of water defences.|$|E
5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, <b>streams,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers.</b> However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E
5|$|North Korea's lack {{of large}} airstrips and {{aircraft}} meant it conducted only minimal air resupply, mostly critical items being imported from China. Other than this, however, aircraft played almost {{no role in}} North Korean logistics. The North Koreans were also not able to effectively use sea transport to their advantage. Ports in Wonsan and Hungnam {{could be used for}} the transport of some troops and supplies, but they remained far too underdeveloped to support any large-scale logistical movements, and the port of Inchon in the south was difficult to navigate with large numbers of ships. The interior of Korea also lacked navigable waterways, as the shallow <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rivers</b> did not provide for the movement of large ships. These rivers would only be of local importance to battles. The North Koreans tried on several occasions to resupply their units by sea or conduct amphibious operations at the outbreak of the war but each time were decisively defeated. At engagements such as the Battle of Pusan and the Battle of Chumonchin Chan the UN naval blockade was effective in halting almost all North Korean naval activity.|$|E
