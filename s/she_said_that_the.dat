5|$|The Haunting was {{released}} on 18 September 1963. Audiences were frightened by it.

In Houston, Texas, a local cinema promoted the film as so chilling that it held a contest to see which of four patrons could sit all the way through a midnight screening; the prize was $100.

In the manga's first chapters, Allen's eyes have had different colors (such as red and light blue) due to a discussion between Hoshino and her editor; it was later decided to give him silver eyes. The series' title, D.Gray-man, is meant to have several meanings, (most referring to the state of Allen and the other main characters).|$|E
