500|$|Prior {{to writing}} the script, Arndt {{read in a}} {{newspaper}} about Arnold Schwarzenegger speaking {{to a group of}} high school students and saying [...] "If there's one thing in this world I hate, it's losers.

I wanted to... attack that idea that in life you're going up or you're going down... So to a degree a child beauty pageant is the epitome of the ultimate stupid meaningless competition people put themselves through." [...] Co-director Jonathan Dayton also commented on the importance of the pageant to the film: [...] "As far as the pageant goes, it was very important to us that the film not be about pageants. It's about being out of place, it's about not knowing where you're going to end up..." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1997 they {{released}} their debut full-length album Under the Western Freeway, and, {{with the help}} of Howe Gelb, signed a UK deal with Big Cat Records (by then a subsidiary of V2), who reissued the album the following year. The album included the single [...] "A.M. 180", which was featured during a sequence in the 2002 British film 28 Days Later. It was also used for the theme song for the BBC Four television series Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe, and in an advertisement for Colin Murray's BBC Radio 1 show. [...] "A.M. 180" [...] was also used in television commercials for the Dodge Journey automobile. One of the album's singles, [...] "Summer Here Kids", was rated as [...] "Single of the Week" [...] by popular British music magazine NME, and was also used as the theme music for another Charlie Brooker-fronted show, BBC Radio 4's <b>So</b> <b>Wrong</b> It's Right. The album led to an increase in the band's popularity in Europe, and a main stage performance at the Reading Festival in 1998. The album was only a success in the US when later reissued by V2. With the band busy touring in 1999, their next release was the compilation The Broken Down Comforter Collection.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Shearer criticized what he {{perceived}} as the show's declining quality: [...] "I rate {{the last three seasons}} as among the worst, so season four looks very good to me now." [...] Shearer has also been vocal about [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] (season nine, 1997) {{one of the most controversial}} episodes of The Simpsons.

[...] Due to scheduling and availability conflicts, Shearer decided not to participate in The Simpsons Ride, which opened in 2008, so none of his characters have vocal parts and many do not appear in the ride at all. In a 2010 interview on The Howard Stern Show, Shearer alluded that the reason he was not part of the ride was because he would not be getting paid for it.|$|E
500|$|... "Rosemary's Baby" [...] {{was named}} {{as one of}} the [...] "Top 11 TV Episodes of 2007" [...] by UGO, and ranked thirteenth on The Futon Critics list of [...] "the 50 Best Episodes of 2007"; both citing the Baldwin and Morgan therapy scene as the reason. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{declared}} it as [...] "one of 30 Rock's best episodes ever" [...] He praised Carrie Fisher's guest appearance, but felt that Baldwin's role-playing during Morgan's therapy session stole the show. Bob Sassone of TV Squad felt that even though the plot was [...] "insane", the episode still managed [...] "to have a heart at its core". Sassone called the therapy scene [...] "one of the funniest scenes ... on TV this season". Robert Canning of IGN felt that the episode has [...] "great storylines to great guest stars", making it [...] "one of the best the series has produced so far". Canning called the therapy scene [...] "the best moment of the episode". [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] " [...] Between Carrie Fisher's delightfully bonkers guest role and Jack Donaghy's hijacking of Tracy Jordan's therapy session, this 2007 episode was <b>so</b> <b>wrong.</b> And so good." [...] In 2016 Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker described the episode as [...] "the keys-to-all-mythologies of female comedy", which A. O. Scott of The New York Times said [...] "may actually be an understatement. The character of Rosemary Howard certainly embodies the glories and contradictions of second-wave feminism, and Liz's ambivalence about her is a barbed and brilliant illustration of the anxieties of female comic influence". Scott added that given Lemon's depiction as a Star Wars fan, [...] "the casting of Ms. Fisher ... adds about 12 dimensions of meta".|$|E
