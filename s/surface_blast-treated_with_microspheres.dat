Cerebral ischaemia was induced by administration of 900 microspheres (48 [*]μm) into the internal carotid artery. The rats with stroke-like symptoms were treated p. o. with 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 nebracetam twice daily. The levels of acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and their metabolites in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus of animals <b>with</b> <b>microsphere</b> embolism were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (h. p. l. c.) on the 3 rd and 7 th days after the operation. Although the microsphere embolism induced significant changes {{in most of the}} neurotransmitters and some of their metabolites in the brain regions, the delayed treatment with nebracetam partially restored only the hippocampal 5 -HT and the striatal dopamine metabolite contents on the 3 rd day.

40|$|Background: Autogenous fat {{injection}} {{is widely}} used for the correction of acquired and congenital soft tissue defects.

We hypothesised that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent mitogen and known stimulant for murine preadipocytes, would improve fat graft survival when concentrations were sustained <b>with</b> a gelatine <b>microsphere</b> delivery system. Methods: Abdominal fat was harvested from an otherwise healthy 43 -year-old woman during a breast reconstruction. Prior to subdermal injection into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, the fat grafts were divided into 1 -ml aliquots, mixed <b>with</b> <b>microspheres</b> bound to PDGF, free PDGF, or nothing depending on its experimental group, and weighed. The following experimental groups were thus created (minimum n = 8 per group) : (1) fat graft control, (2) fat graft with free PDGF, (3) fat graft <b>with</b> blank <b>microspheres,</b> and (4) fat graft <b>with</b> <b>microspheres</b> bound to PDGF. After 12 weeks, the fat xenografts were harvested for analysis of weight maintenance and histological and morphometric evaluation.

The luXe clearance curve obtained from sampling dorsal sagittal sinus blood following left ventricular injection showed either two or three components. Blood flow calculated from the first component can be correlated with the average gray matter blood flow through the caudate nucleus, the cortical gray, and the thalamus calculated from the microsphere data. The second component of the llJXe curve correlated well with the white matter blood flow measured <b>with</b> <b>microspheres.</b> In seven out of 15 experiments, there was a third component in the luXe clearance curve. The blood flow obtained from the third component showed a close correlation with extracranial muscle blood flow determined <b>with</b> <b>microspheres.</b> The mean cerebral blood flow measured with the '"Xe clearance method was {{in close agreement with}} that obtained by the micro-sphere technique. After the injection of luXe into extracranial muscles, the slope of the clearance curve obtained from the dorsal sagittal sinus correlated well with that of the third component following left ventricular injection.

40|$|AbstractOuter {{hair cell}} (OHC) electromotility, a {{response}} consisting of reversible changes in cell length and diameter induced by electrical stimulation, confers remarkable sensitivity and frequency {{resolution to the}} mammalian inner ear. Looking for {{a better understanding of}} this mechanism, we labeled isolated guinea pig OHCs <b>with</b> <b>microspheres</b> and, using high-speed video recording, investigated their movements at the apical, mid, and basal regions of osmotically and electrically stimulated cells. After hypoosmotic challenge, OHCs shortened and their diameter increased, <b>with</b> <b>microspheres</b> moving always toward the central plane; iso-osmolarity returned OHCs to their original shape and microspheres to their original positions. Under electrical stimulation, microspheres exhibited robust movements, with their displacement vectors changing in direction from random to parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cells with peak reorientation speeds of up to 6 rad/s and returning to random after 5  min without stimulation. Alterations in plasma-membrane cholesterol levels as well as cytoskeleton integrity affected microsphere responses. We concluded that microspheres attach to different molecular microdomains, and these microdomains are able to shift and rotate in the plane of the OHC lateral wall with a dynamics tightly regulated by membrane lipid composition and the cortical cytoskeleton...|$|R

We focused on the time taken to regain adhesive potential in unrestrained Hymenopterans (Polyrhachis dives and Myrmica scabrinodis) and Coccinellids (Harmonia axyridis and Adalia bipunctata) fouled <b>with</b> <b>microspheres.</b> We found that the reattainment of adhesion is influenced by particle type and size in Hymenopterans, with an interaction between the surface energy of the contaminating particle and substrate.

Hypertrophic hearts, in contrast to control hearts, developed ischemic areas during oxygen-saturated Langendorff perfusion.

Srinivas et al. [11] also reported on the value of 90 Y dosimetry for HCC lesional assessment, finding a mean dose of 215  Gy for responders as measured on CT, based on a cohort of 98 lesions treated <b>with</b> glass <b>microspheres.</b> Most recently, Fowler et al. [10] reported an average dose of 29.8  Gy and D 70 of 42.3  Gy as useful predictors of response as measured by volumetric MRI analysis, based on a study of 9 mCRC patients (all treated <b>with</b> resin <b>microspheres)</b> <b>with</b> response measured at various intervals corresponding to ‘standard of care’.|$|R
3000|$|Previous work in {{the area}} of 90 Y imaging by PET has {{established}} this technique as being potentially useful for the precise assessment of the spatial distribution of microspheres and to determine the quantitative input activity map for subsequent dosimetric calculations [15, 17]. The advantage of using TOF vs. non-TOF reconstruction has also been recently studied in a comprehensive manner [19]. However, all these studies were conducted in the context of therapeutic radioembolization <b>with</b> <b>microspheres</b> [15, 19] or PRRT [17]. This type of treatment results in a radioactive concentration of several MBq mL− 1 or even tens of MBq mL− 1 [...]...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the $I_c(B) $ [...] $T_c(B) $ phase boundary of superconducting niobium films with large area quasihexagonal hole arrays is reported. The hole arrays were patterned <b>with</b> <b>microsphere</b> photolithography. We investigate the perforated niobium films by means of electrical directed current transport measurements close to the transition temperature $T_c$ in perpendicularly applied magnetic fields. We find pronounced modulations of the critcal current with applied magnetic field, which we interpret {{as a consequence of}} commensurable states between the Abrikosov vortex lattice and the quasihexagonal pinning array. Furthermore, we observe Little-Parks oscillations in the critical temperature vs magnetic field...|$|R
40|$|We cooled ultrathin tapered fibers to {{cryogenic}} {{temperatures and}} controllably coupled them <b>with</b> high-Q <b>microsphere</b> resonators at a wavelength {{close to the}} optical transition of diamond nitrogen vacancy centers. The 310 -nm-diameter tapered fibers were stably nanopositioned close to the <b>microspheres</b> <b>with</b> a positioning stability of approximately 10 nm over a temperature range of 7 - 28 K. A cavity-induced phase shift was observed in this temperature range, demonstrating a discrete transition from undercoupling to overcoupling...|$|R
