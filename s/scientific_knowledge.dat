Lindelof said that with her <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge,</b> her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she {{was created by the}} Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers. In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that Prometheus is pro-science and explores whether <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> and faith in God can co-exist.|$|E

40|$|Educational {{data science}} is an {{emerging}} transdisciplinary field formed from an amalgamation of data science and elements of biological, psychological and neuroscientific knowledge about learning, or learning science. This article conceptualises educational data {{science as a}} biopolitical strategy focused on the evaluation {{and management of the}} corporeal, emotional and embrained lives of children. Such strategies are enacted through the development of new kinds of digitally-mediated ‘biopedagogies’ of body optimisation, ‘psychopedagogies’ of emotional maximisation, and ‘neuropedagogies’ of brain empowerment. The data practices, <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledges,</b> digital devices and pedagogies that constitute educational data science produce new systems of knowledge about the child that are consequential to their formation as ‘biodigital’ subjects, whose assumed qualities and capacities are defined through expert practices of biosensing, emotion analytics, and neurocomputation, combined with associated <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledges.</b> The article develops the concept of transcoding to account for the processes involved {{in the formation of the}} biodigital child...|$|R
5|$|The {{overarching}} methodological {{principle of}} positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly {{the same manner}} as natural science.

5|$|The {{traditional}} focuses {{of sociology}} include social stratification, social class, social mobility, religion, secularization, law, sexuality and deviance. As all spheres {{of human activity}} {{are affected by the}} interplay between social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects, such as health, medical, economy, military and penal institutions, the Internet, education, social capital and the role of social activity in the development of <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge.</b>|$|E

From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge,</b> he handled this task efficiently.

5|$|Complementing his {{interest}} in the foundations of general relativity and, more generally, of physics, Ehlers researched the history of physics. Up until his death, he collaborated in a project on the history of quantum theory at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. In particular, he explored Pascual Jordan's seminal contributions to the development of quantum field theory between 1925 and 1928. Throughout his career, Ehlers had an interest in the philosophical foundations and implications of physics and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such as the basic status of <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> in physics.|$|E
5|$|E.V. Ramasamy also {{blamed the}} capitalists for their control of machineries, {{creating}} difficulties for the workers. According to his philosophy, rationalism, {{which has to}} lead the way for peaceful life to all, had resulted in causing poverty and worries to the people because of dominating forces. He stated that there is no use of simply acquiring titles or amassing wealth if one has no self-respect or <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge.</b> An example he gave was the West sending messages to the planets, while the Tamil society in India were sending rice and cereals to their dead forefathers through the Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|He {{served on}} the boards of the Electricity Trust and the Housing Trust, among others. Here, unused to not being in {{absolute}} control, and having little specific <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge,</b> he occasionally stumbled in his decisions. This also created difficulties with the other board members, who were reluctant to disagree with their former boss, regardless of their expertise. But his thrift, a theme throughout his Premiership, did not abate; he was constantly forcing the trusts to use cost-saving methods and old vehicles for their work. This extended to his family property; he vigorously opposed his son's desire to install a new irrigation system in the orchard.|$|E

5|$|The Crystal Palace Dinosaurs, {{also known}} as Dinosaur Court, {{are a series of}} sculptures of dinosaurs and other extinct animals in Crystal Palace Park, in the London borough of Bromley. Commissioned in 1852 to {{accompany}} the Crystal Palace after its move from the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park and unveiled in 1854, they were the first dinosaur sculptures in the world, pre-dating the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species by six years. While to varying degrees inaccurate by modern standards, the models were designed and sculpted by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins under the scientific direction of Sir Richard Owen, representing the latest <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> at the time. The models were classed as Grade II listed buildings from 1973, extensively restored in 2002, and upgraded to Grade I listed in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The impenetrable Venusian {{cloud cover}} gave science fiction writers free rein to {{speculate}} on conditions at its surface; {{all the more so}} when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans. The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different, and brought this particular genre to an end. As <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Venus advanced, so science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.|$|E
5|$|The play also {{features}} an ambiguous and multifaceted portrayal of <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge,</b> celebrating it for its humanistic achievements and discoveries, but also warning {{that it can}} do immense harm when {{in the hands of}} the unethical or overambitious. Given these themes, the play is likely Verne's most purely science-fictional work. Structurally, the play evokes the three-part design of Jacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which the hero must choose between love and art. In Journey Through the Impossible, however, the choice is between positive ideals—love, goodness, happiness—and the unbounded scientific ambitions of the sinister Doctor Ox.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{subjectivity}} and objectivity {{can be divided}} into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge.</b> In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.|$|E

5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language, the absence of <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E
