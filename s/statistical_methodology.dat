500|$|While some {{descriptions}} of taxonomic history attempt to date taxonomy to ancient civilizations, a truly scientific attempt to classify organisms {{did not occur}} until the 18th century. Earlier works were primarily descriptive and focused on plants that were useful in agriculture or medicine. There {{are a number of}} stages in this scientific thinking. Early taxonomy was based on arbitrary criteria, the so-called [...] "artificial systems", including Linnaeus's system of sexual classification. Later came systems based on a more complete consideration of the characteristics of taxa, referred to as [...] "natural systems", such as those of de Jussieu (1789), de Candolle (1813) and Bentham and Hooker (1862–1863). These were pre-evolutionary in thinking. The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859) led to new ways of thinking about classification based on evolutionary relationships. This was the concept of phyletic systems, from 1883 onwards. This approach was typified by those of Eichler (1883) and Engler (1886–1892). The advent of molecular genetics and <b>statistical</b> <b>methodology</b> allowed the creation of the modern era of [...] "phylogenetic systems" [...] based on cladistics, rather than morphology alone.|$|E

In 1995, Bronfenbrenner and Juravich co-wrote a second work, 'Union Tactics Matter: The Impact of Union Tactics on Certification Elections, First Contracts, and Membership Rates.' Based on Bronfenbrenner's doctoral dissertation, the two papers were widely distributed throughout the labor movement and {{had a significant impact}} in promoting union organizing as a key issue in the 1995 AFL-CIO presidential race.

Harr pointed out that some members of the Schieder commission and officials of the Statistisches Bundesamt involved {{in the study of the}} expulsions were involved in the Nazi plan to colonize Eastern Europe.

Haar questions the validity of population balances in general. He maintains that 27,000 German Jews who were Nazi victims are included in the West German figures. He rejects the statement by the German government that the figure of 500–600,000 deaths omitted those people who died of disease and hunger, and has stated that this is a [...] "mistaken interpretation" [...] of the data. He maintains that deaths due to disease, hunger and other conditions are already included in the lower numbers. According to Haar the numbers were set too high for decades, for postwar political reasons.|$|E
