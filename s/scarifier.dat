5000|$|J. Hall's (1970) {{report on}} the state of site {{preparation}} in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant hardwood stands for natural regeneration of yellow birch. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young's teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine-spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. <b>scarifier,</b> after strengthening, had been [...] "quite successful" [...] for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone <b>scarifier</b> and barrel ring <b>scarifier,</b> and development had begun on a new flail <b>scarifier</b> for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary furrower from Finland.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{preparation}} of suitable sites for planting and growing of tree seedlings following logging is recognized by British Columbia Forest Service {{as a major}} silvicultural problem in the Central and Northern Interior regions of the province. Over the past few decades, scarification trials have been made with various types of drag and blade <b>scarifiers.</b> Substantial areas, particularly on the dry lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta latifolia) sites have also received mechanical scarification on an operational scale. The wet white spruce [...] alpine fir (Picea glauca ssp. glauca [...] Abies lasiocarpa) sites, which often have a deep layer of undecomposed organic material on the forest floor, have traditionally been winter logged. The resulting accumulation of undisturbed duff, and logging slash, has normally been either windrow or broadcast burned. Some recent escape fires, e. g. the Eden Fire in the Kamloops Forest District in September 1973, caused considerable personal property damage, and have heightened interest in mechanical scarification {{as an alternative to}} prescribed burning. The author had occasion during the summer of 1974 to be employed by British Columbia Forest Service on a research project in the Prince George area entitled, Silvicultural Mechanical Site Preparation (S. M. S. P.). The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure and evaluate the performance of selected mechanical <b>scarifiers,</b> in producing an economically, and silviculturally acceptable level of planting site preparation. This report examines the findings of the S. M. S. P. project, and where appropriate, compares them with earlier Canadian forest scarification studies. Recommendations for the use of specific mechanical site preparation equipment are viewed both singly, and in combination with other forest management practices...|$|R
50|$|Burrell's {{made their}} first road roller in 1891 which was {{supplied}} {{to a local}} contractor in close by Roundham, Norfolk. Product increased gradually until {{the turn of the}} century when there was regular demand for new machines. Burrell road rollers were a very conventional design and changed little in their total run of production. Five different sizes of rollers were available, 6 ton, 8 ton, 10 ton (class A), 12 ton (class B), 14 ton (class C) all available with additional extras, for example <b>scarifiers</b> which broke up the road surface prior to re-laying. In total the company built 384 road rollers in a variety of sizes and configurations with a number of engines converted to rollers at a later date. The final roller was despatched in 1929 to Mutford & Lothingland Rural District Council in Suffolk.|$|R
50|$|Original {{products}} {{included the}} manufacture of stump-jump implements, strippers, windmills, pumps, horse-rakes, wheat separators, ploughs, harrows, <b>scarifiers,</b> and other agricultural and general implements. The firm later produced tramcars and railway rolling stock, assembled Ford Model Ts, and manufactured a range of stationary engines. It manufactured over 600 O class trams, which were not only used in Sydney, but also Brisbane, Melbourne, Ballarat and Bendigo. It manufactured {{many different types of}} rolling stock such as brake vans, coal wagons, Bradfield suburban carriages, 12 wheel carriages for the New South Wales Government Railways and sleeper carriages for the Trans-Australian Railway in 1915. There was a large fire in 1908 that totally destroyed the carriage shop and some completed railway carriages ready for delivery, as well as many uncompleted carriages and trams. This resulted in 150 men losing their jobs. Stationary engines were made in several sizes for general use, initially copies of the Scottish Melvin. The Commonwealth Government purchased both horizontal and vertical engines for use on the Trans-Australian Railway for pumping water into overhead tanks for the steam locomotives.|$|R

50|$|Box blades are a {{variation}} of the rear blade which has developed into its own implement, with uses that parallel that of a rear blade, but are distinct. They consist of a heavy metal 3 sided box, with the front, top and bottom open. The front has retractable <b>scarifiers</b> which can be used to break up hard ground. The rear has a forward and reverse cutting edge mounted at the bottom, with the reverse cutting edge often gated or floating on more expensive models. Box blades are usually very heavy due to the forces placed on them - even a lightweight one will weigh 500 pounds. The implement works going forward by scraping soil, carrying it forward as it rolls inside the box, and allowing some to work out as the blade passes over low spots. It works going back much like a dozer blade, pushing dirt, which can spill out the bottom or sides. Unlike a dozer blade, box blades are not adjustable relative to the tractor more than a few degrees in any direction, and generally only when the operator dismounts the tractor.|$|R

It is at once the centre of wealth and the sink of misery; the seat of intellect and empire: and yet a wilderness wherein they, who live like wild beasts upon their fellow-creatures, find prey and cover. Other wild beasts have long since been extirpated: even in the wilds of Scotland, and of barbarous, or worse than barbarous Ireland, the wolf is no longer to be found; a degree of civilisation this to which no other country has attained. Man, and man alone, is permitted to run wild. You plough your fields and harrow them; you have your <b>scarifiers</b> to make the ground clean; and if after all this weeds should spring up, the careful cultivator roots them out by hand. But ignorance and misery and vice are allowed to grow, and blossom, and seed, not on the waste alone, but in the very garden and pleasure-ground of society and civilisation.

50|$|According to J. Hall (1970), in Ontario at least, {{the most}} widely used site {{preparation}} technique was post-harvest mechanical scarification by equipment front-mounted on a bulldozer (blade, rake, V-plow, or teeth), or dragged behind a tractor (Imsett or S.F.I. <b>scarifier,</b> or rolling chopper). Drag type units designed and constructed by Ontario's Department of Lands and Forests used anchor chain or tractor pads separately or in combination, or were finned steel drums or barrels of various sizes and used in sets alone or combined with tractor pad or anchor chain units.|$|E

5000|$|Lawson {{decided to}} {{commence}} farming from a modern perspective {{and as such}} placed great emphasis on the inventions of the new industrial age, with particular reference to steam cultivation. In February 1862, No 95 of John Fowler's Patent Steam Ploughing Tackle arrived at Aspatria railway station. The affectionately named ‘Cyclops,’ {{the first of its}} kind in Cumberland, comprised a [...] portable steam engine, with the capacity to drive a grubber, plough, cultivator, and <b>scarifier.</b> Once unloaded, the 10-ton curiosity astonished onlookers when it travelled along the road without the aid of horses. On that monumental day a rustic voice called out from the crowd, [...] "She'll nivver git up Thompson's Brow." [...] However, it did and upon the successful ascent of what is now called ‘Station Hill’, a second voice cried, [...] "well she's gitten up, but she'll nivver ploow!" [...] The engine continued to promenade the streets of Aspatria, accompanied by a large concourse of people, finally arriving at Brayton Hall, the scene of the inaugural trials. After a series of mishaps, misfortunes, breakages and repairs, ploughing commenced, which provoked a bystander to remark, [...] "Well she's gitten up Thompson's Brow, and she's ploow'd 'er fust furro', but she'll nivver pay." [...] This criticism proved correct; for Lawson only achieved a profit in two of the ten working years. However Lawson attributed the majority of the losses to inexperience, and with the knowledge of hindsight the consensus opinion was that steam cultivation could work at a profit. In ten years, the loss upon the steam plough alone stood at £850. This was not surprising, since the cost for breakages and repairs exceeded £1,500. This figure would have reduced had the calculation considered the value of the permanent improvements to the land. They should have also offset the loss by costing the value of the unearthed stones, which Lawson used for erecting buildings and constructing roads.|$|E

Department of Energy Tanks Focus Area to investigate existing and emerging retrieval processes suitable for the retrieval of high-level radioactive waste inside underground storage tanks. This program, represented by industry, national laboratories, and academia, seeks to provide a technical and cost basis to support site-remediation decisions. Part of this program has involved the development of a high-pressure waterjet dislodging system and pneumatic conveyance integrated as a <b>scarifier.</b> Industry has used high-pressure waterjet technology for many years to mine, cut, clean, and scarify materials with a broad range of properties. The <b>scarifier</b> was developed as an alternate means of retrieving waste inside Hanford single-shell tanks, particularly hard, stubborn waste.

Scarification, clipping and dry heat were used to break dormancy in smooth loofah seed at the Department of Horticulture, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand. A completely randomized design with 20 treatments was used involving: untreated seed (control), clipping, scarifying by <b>scarifier</b> at 40, 70 and 100  revolutions per minute (rpm) for 1  min, and dry heat at 60  °C, 70  °C and 80  °C for 1 – 5  h. After breaking dormancy, seed germination was tested in four replicates, with 50 seeds per replicate. The thickness of the seed coat was measured under a digital microscope. The results showed that clipped seeds gave the highest germination (100 %) and decreased mean germination time (3. 58  d). Scarified seed using a <b>scarifier</b> at 70 and 100  rpm for 1  min resulted in germination rates of 67. 0 – 75. 5 %, which was higher than for seeds scarified at 40  rpm. The dry heat-treated seeds at 60  °C for 3 – 5  h and at 70  °C for 2 – 5  h had germination of 71. 0 – 80. 5 %.
