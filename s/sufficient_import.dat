Three main conclusions can be drawn from the analysis. First, the results identified a long-run relationship between real gross domestic product and variables of real exports. Second, as the results from the basic model suggest, to ease the pressure from the balance-of-payments constraints on output growth, shifts in elasticities of export and import flows are required. Third, owing to the reported modernization needs of the Slovenian economy, persistence of import patterns, and empirically documented strong dependence of exports on <b>sufficient</b> <b>imports,</b> manipulation of export demand seems to be more justified. balance of payments, economic growth, exports,...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} endeavours {{to understand}} and describe the dissatisfaction of psychologists with the complaints process administered by the Psychologists Board under the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 (HPCAA). This issue was raised in previous research¹ that sought opinions of psychologists within the Family Court regarding changes to the Care of Children legislation. The issue was of <b>sufficient</b> <b>import</b> to be self-reported by psychologists {{even when it was}} not part of the original interview questions. The purpose of this research is therefore to develop on discussions and consultations that followed that research, to consult those working with the psychologists’ complaints system and other bodies operating within the HPCAA. The research focuses particularly on whether the issues raised relate to the process or to the legislation. Consideration is given to whether the introduction of an early resolution process into the Act is feasible and preferred. The research also asks whether there are other amendments that the various bodies would like incorporated should the Act be amended in the future. In order to determine this, it is necessary to firstly understand how the HPCAA was developed and how it appears in the regulatory environment. Secondly, it is necessary to consider the legislative environment to determine whether the legislation needs improvement. This is done by contrasting the legislation with that of another professional body, in this case the Law Society, in terms of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006. Health complaints can also be lodged with the Health and Disability Commissioner, so that process and legislation² are considered as well. Thirdly, how the HPCAA is administered with regards to the complaints process by the Psychologists Board is considered, along with two other Boards operating under the same Act for comparative purposes. Within the research the bicultural considerations of the process are also considered, with particular focus on the restorative process. Finally, where possible the research considers other dispute resolution methods(ADR). This ADR may require specific amendments to the HPCAA. ¹ Debra Ridgway "Principles and Practice of Psychological Reporting in the Family Court" (LAWS 389 Research Essay, Victoria University of Wellington, 2013). ² Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994...|$|E
40|$|This report {{covers the}} {{activities}} of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) for the calendar year 1999. This was a year of notable achievements and significant frustrations. Both the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) programs were delayed. The Space Shuttle prudently postponed launches after the occurrence of a wiring short during ascent of the STS- 93 mission. The ISS construction schedule slipped {{as a result of the}} Space Shuttle delays and problems the Russians experienced in readying the Service Module and its launch vehicle. Each of these setbacks was dealt with in a constructive way. The STS- 93 short circuit led to detailed wiring inspections and repairs on all four orbiters as well as analysis of other key subsystems for similar types of hidden damage. The ISS launch delays afforded time for further testing, training, development, and contingency planning. The safety consciousness of the NASA and contractor workforces, from hands-on labor to top management, continues high. Nevertheless, workforce issues remain among the most serious safety concerns of the Panel. Cutbacks and reorganizations over the past several years have resulted in problems related to workforce size, critical skills, and the extent of on-the-job experience. These problems have the potential to impact safety as the Space Shuttle launch rate increases to meet the demands of the ISS and its other customers. As with last year's report, these work- force-related issues were considered of <b>sufficient</b> <b>import</b> to place them first in the material that follows. Some of the same issues of concern for the Space Shuttle and ISS arose in a review of the launch vehicle for the Terra mission that the Panel was asked by NASA to undertake. Other areas the Panel was requested to assess included the readiness of the Inertial Upper Stage for the deployment of the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the possible safety impact of electromagnetic effects on the Space Shuttle. The findings and recommendations in this report do not highlight any major, immediate issues that might compromise the safe pursuit of the various NASA programs. They do, however, cover concerns that the Panel believes should be addressed in the interest of maintaining NASA's excellent safety record. The Panel is pleased to note that remedial efforts for some of the findings raised are underway. Given appropriate funding and cooperative efforts among the Administration, the Congress and the various contractors, the Panel is convinced that safety problems can be avoided or solved resulting in lower risk for NASA's human space and aeronautics programs. Section II of this report contains specific findings and recommendations generated by Panel activities during the calendar year 1999. Section III presents more detailed information in support of these findings and recommendations. A current roster of Panel members, consultants, and staff is included as Appendix A. Appendix B contains NASA's response to the findings and recommendations from the 1998 annual report.

Also, the black female school counselors showed a significantly greater need to initiate inclusion behavior than the white female school counselors. Since {{the vast majority of the}} scores were less than one standard deviation from the mean (national sample) they were considered trivial. However, there were some significant group differences. While such differences existed and possibly limited counselor effectiveness, they could be ameliorated by staff development procedures. The only significant differences in interpersonal behavior patterns were consistent with usual sex role stereotypes. The demographic backgrounds of the school counselors were more similar than dissimilar, except that the white males had higher degrees and higher state certification than the black male school counselors and the black female school counselors. While the four groups compared were more similar than dissimilar, those differences that were found are of <b>sufficient</b> <b>import</b> to warrant further investigation particularly as they relate to counselor effectiveness.

Appearance of green fluorescence in leaf tissue inoculated with PSTVd-fragment-containing constructs indicated shuttling of the RNA into the nucleus by fragments as short as 80 nucleotides in length. Plant-to-plant variation in the timing of intron removal and subsequent GFP fluorescence was observed; however, earliest and most abundant GFP expression was obtained with constructs containing the conserved hairpin I paand embedded upper central conserved region.

40|$|Hydrophobic {{membrane}} proteins are cotranslationally {{targeted to}} the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, mediated by hydrophobic signal sequence. Mitochondrial membrane proteins escape this mechanism despite their hydrophobic character. We examined sorting of membrane proteins into the mitochondria, by using mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter isoform (ABC-me). In {{the absence of}} 135 -residue N-terminal hydrophilic segment (N 135), the membrane domain was integrated into the ER membrane in COS 7 cells. Other sequences that were <b>sufficient</b> to <b>import</b> soluble protein into mitochondria could not import the membrane domain. N 135 imports other membrane proteins into mitochondria. N 135 prevents cotranslational targeting of the membrane domain to ER and in turn achieves posttranslational import into mitochondria. In a cell-free system, N 135 suppresses targeting to the ER membranes, although it does not affect recognition of hydrophobic segments by signal recognition particle.

Import of these complexes was fast and efficient and could be inhibited by a competitor, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) coupled to BSA. For import of short ssDNA, VirD 2 was <b>sufficient,</b> whereas <b>import</b> of long ssDNA additionally required VirE 2. A VirD 2 mutant lacking its C-terminal NLS was unable to mediate import of the T-DNA complexes into nuclei.

RecA, another ssDNA binding protein, could substitute for VirE 2 in the nuclear import of T-DNA but not in earlier events of T-DNA transfer to plant cells. We propose that VirD 2 directs the T-DNA complex to the nuclear pore, whereas both proteins mediate its passage through the pore.

40|$|Based on the {{findings}} of this study, the following actions are proposed for consideration by the Government of Kenya: 1. Raise public investment in maize seed breeding and agronomic research {{to make it possible for}} improvements in smallholder crop productivity. Based on research evaluating the returns to alternative investments in agriculture, public expenditures in maize seed breeding and agronomy may constitute the single most important investment to promote broad-based productivity growth and poverty reduction in Kenya. 2. Explore options for improving public and private extension programs to enable farmers to adopt improved farm technologies generated from point 1. 3. Examine options for bringing more land in Kenya under potential cultivation by smallholder farmers. Unless the land constraints in currently densely populated rural areas of Kenya are relieved, it is unlikely that a large portion of farmers in Kenya that own less than one hectare will be able to rise out of the semi-subsistence conditions that keep them trapped in poverty. 4. Support training programs to enable smallholders to develop more effective marketing strategies and to negotiate more effectively with traders, in order to raise the prices that they receive for their maize. 5. Raise public investment in road, rail, and port infrastructure to reduce marketing costs as well as the cost of modern inputs such as fertilizer to the farm gate. Rehabilitating the Kenyan railway system would be a key priority. If this were done prior to 2009, maize imports could have arrived in greater volumes much faster in early 2009 and pushed food prices down faster. 6. When early warning estimates predict a need for large import quantities, remove the import tariff soon enough to allow traders to import over a sufficiently long period to avoid transport capacity constraints and domestic stockouts. 7. Review the rationale for denying import licenses when applied for by traders. 8. Consider the costs and benefits from the standpoint of governments of transitioning from discretionary trade and marketing policy to adherence to more systematic rules-based policies. Nurturing credible commitment in regard to trade policy is likely to promote market predictability and therefore, lead to greater supplies and price stability in food markets during times of domestic production shortfalls. 9. Consider whether current proposals for international stockholding would be effective in the presence of domestic transport capacity constraints. International physical or financial reserves would not be able to relieve localized food production shortfalls unless local transport capacity is adequate to absorb <b>sufficient</b> <b>imports</b> within a concentrated period or unless import licenses are provided or the state carries out or contracts for the importation from the international stock source.

40|$|Import of Hansenula polymorpha {{alcohol oxidase}} (AO) into peroxisomes is {{dependent}} on the PTS 1 receptor, HpPex 5 p. The PTS 1 of AO (-LARF) is sufficient to direct reporter proteins to peroxisomes. To study AO sorting in more detail, strains producing mutant AO proteins were constructed. AO containing a mutation in the FAD binding fold was mislocalized to the cytosol. This indicates that the PTS 1 of AO is not <b>sufficient</b> for <b>import</b> of AO. AO protein in which the PTS 1 was destroyed (-LARA) was normally sorted to peroxisomes. Moreover, C-terminal deletions of up to 16 amino acids did not significantly affect AO import, indicating that the PTS 1 was not necessary for targeting. Consistent with these observations we found that AO import occurred independent from the C-terminal TPR-domain of HpPex 5 p, known to bind PTS 1 peptides. Synthesis of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1 – 272) of HpPex 5 p in pex 5 cells restored AO import, whereas other PTS 1 proteins were mislocalized to the cytosol. These data indicate that AO is imported via a novel HpPex 5 p-dependent protein translocation pathway, which does not require the PTS 1 of AO and the C-terminal TPR domains of HpPex 5 p, but involves FAD binding and the N-terminus of HpPex 5 p. ...|$|R

We analysed this role by using two yeast mutants of mtHsp 70 that differentially influenced its interaction with Tim 44. One mutant mtHsp 70 (Ssc 1 - 2 p) efficiently bound preproteins, but did not show a detectable complex formation with Tim 44; the mitochondria imported loosely folded preproteins with wild-type kinetics, yet were impaired in unfolding of preproteins. The other mutant Hsp 70 (Ssc 1 - 3 p') bound both Tim 44 and preproteins, but the mitochondria did not import folded polypeptides and were impaired in import of unfolded preproteins; Ssc 1 - 3 p' was defective in its ATPase domain and did not undergo a nucleotide-dependent conformational change, resulting in permanent binding to Tim 44. The following conclusions are suggested. (i) The import of loosely folded polypeptides (translocase function of mtHsp 70) {{does not depend on}} formation of a detectable Hsp 70 -Tim 44 complex. Two explanations are possible: a trapping mechanism by soluble mtHsp 70, or a weak/very transient interaction of Ssc 1 - 2 p with Tim 44 that leads to a weak force generation <b>sufficient</b> for <b>import</b> of loosely folded, but not folded, polypeptides. (ii) Import of folded preproteins (unfoldase function of mtHsp 70) involves a reversible nucleotide-dependent interaction of mtHsp 70 with Tim 44, including a conformational change in mtHsp 70. This is consistent with a model that the dynamic interaction of mtHsp 70 with Tim 44 generates a pulling force on preproteins which supports unfolding during translocation...|$|R
40|$|Acetyl-coenzyme A {{carboxylase}} (ACCase) {{occurs in}} at least two forms in rapeseed (Brassica napus) : a homomeric (HO) and presumably cytosolic isozyme and a heteromeric, plastidial isozyme. We investigated whether the HO-ACCase of Arabidopsis can be targeted to plastids of B. napus seeds. A chloroplast transit peptide and the napin promoter were fused to the Arabidopsis ACC 1 gene and transformed into B. napus, with the following results. (a) The small subunit transit peptide was <b>sufficient</b> to provide <b>import</b> of this very large protein into developing seed plastids. (b) HO-ACCase in isolated plastids was found to be biotinylated at a level comparable to extraplastidial HO-ACCase. (c) In vitro assays of HO-ACCase in isolated plastids from developing seeds indicate that it occurs as an enzymatically active form in the plastidial compartment. (d) ACCase activity in mature B. napus seeds is normally very low; however, plants expressing the SSU/ACC 1 gene had 10 - to 20 -fold higher ACCase activity in mature seeds, suggesting that plastid localization prevents the turnover of HO-ACCase. (e) ACCase over-expression altered seed fatty acid composition, with the largest effect being an increase approximately 5 % by the expression of HO-ACCase in plastids...|$|R
40|$|Algeria {{has seen}} a surge in its {{international}} reserves {{over the past few}} years. However, most of this growth is originated by the important increase in oil prices Algeria’s economy is widely dependent vis-à-vis hydrocarbon’s prices due to a low development and diversification of its economic activities. This economy is thus very exposed to external shocks and should prevent against bankruptcy and ensure <b>sufficient</b> equity to <b>import</b> goods and services during these adverse periods. In our study, we first describe certain conventional measures of reserves adequacy and apply them to Algeria. We then analyse Algeria’s historical data {{in order to determine the}} periods in which sudden-stops have occurred. Afterwards, we determine Algeria’s foreign reserves levels using an optimizing model based on Jeanne and Ranciere (2006) approach. As an extension of this model, we represent the effect of the dependence of the national economy vis-à-vis hydrocarbons as a major factor affecting the probability of a sudden-stop. As a result, our evaluation allows us to conclude that Algeria’s foreign reserves are largely sufficient since 2002 and could allow cope with the most severe capital account disturbances...|$|R
40|$|The N-terminal transit {{peptides}} of nuclear-encoded plastid proteins {{are necessary}} and <b>sufficient</b> for their <b>import</b> into plastids, but the information encoded by these transit peptides remains elusive, {{as they have}} a high sequence diversity and lack consensus sequences or common sequence motifs. Here, we investigated the sequence information contained in transit peptides. Hierarchical clustering on transit peptides of 208 plastid proteins showed that the transit peptide sequences are grouped to multiple sequence subgroups. We selected representative proteins from seven of these multiple subgroups and confirmed that their transit peptide sequences are highly dissimilar. Protein import experiments revealed that each protein contained transit peptide–specific sequence motifs critical for protein import into chloroplasts. Bioinformatics analysis identified sequence motifs that were conserved {{among members of the}} identified subgroups. The sequence motifs identified by the two independent approaches were nearly identical or significantly overlapped. Furthermore, the accuracy of predicting a chloroplast protein was greatly increased by grouping the transit peptides into multiple sequence subgroups. Based on these data, we propose that the transit peptides are composed of multiple sequence subgroups that contain distinctive sequence motifs for chloroplast targeting...|$|R
25|$|After 2002, ADMARC {{was under}} {{pressure}} to reduce its financial losses by reducing its trading operations. The World Bank disliked ADMARC being under political control and proposed that it should only keep its core agricultural marketing operations and only provide marketing services in those outlying {{areas of the country}} with limited private sector competition. It was also to give up excess warehouse space in and near towns to a new company, the Malawi Agricultural Warehousing and Trading Company (MAWTCO), which would then lease warehouse space to the private sector. These reforms were implemented from 2006 on, with World Bank support. The private sector lacked the capacity to provide competitive marketing services. It was unable to store enough of grain to meet food needs in the lean season, unwilling to buy maize from smallholders in remote rural areas and without the capacity to <b>import</b> <b>sufficient</b> maize during national shortfalls to maintain prices. As Malawian maize markets did not act competitively, direct state intervention was needed. ADMARC therefore remained as a residual buyer and seller, operating designated floor and ceiling prices. ADMARC’s role allowed some long-distance maize trading between surplus and deficit areas, and created some competition in areas which lacked competing buyers.|$|R
