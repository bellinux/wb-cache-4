500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1664, a bright comet was {{to be seen in}} the sky and the people of London were fearful, {{wondering}} what evil event it portended. London at that time consisted of a city of about 448 acres surrounded by a city wall, which had originally been built to keep out raiding bands. There were gates at Ludgate, Newgate, Aldersgate, Cripplegate, Moorgate and Bishopsgate and to the south lay the River Thames and London Bridge. In the poorer parts of the city, hygiene was impossible to maintain in the overcrowded tenements and garrets. There was no sanitation, and open drains flowed along the centre of winding streets. The cobbles were slippery with animal dung, rubbish and the <b>slops</b> thrown out of the houses, muddy and buzzing with flies in summer and awash with sewage in winter.

The field experiment was conducted on Mahasarakam soil series, using the K 88 - 92 variety of sugar cane. The results showed that distillery <b>slop</b> significantly increased some nutrients in soil, particularly potassium, magnesium, sulfur and chloride. The results also showed that application of distillery <b>slop</b> did not affect most of the physical properties of soil. Only the saturated hydraulic conductivity was significantly decreased under non-application of fertilizer. Under the application of distillery <b>slop,</b> chemical fertilizer had no {{significant effect on the}} yield and the juice quality of sugar cane for both crop years. However, under non-application of distillery <b>slop</b> in the first crop year, application of 21 - 0 - 0 and 20 - 20 - 0 fertilizer had a significant effect on cane yield. With the application of chemical fertilizer, distillery <b>slop</b> had an influence on the yield of sugar cane in both crop years while different doses of <b>slop</b> did not make any significant difference on cane yield. The average yields of the first crop year were 126. 7, 195. 6, 203. 0 and 187. 2 ton/hectare and those of the second crop year were 85. 0, 150. 0, 150. 8 and 142. 4 ton/hectare after the application of 0, 187. 5, 375 and 562. 5 m 3 /hectare, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Co-pyrolysis of <b>slop</b> {{oil with}} {{ferrocene}} {{was carried out}} to convert waste of petroleum into carbon nanoparticles (CNPs). Since <b>slop</b> oil {{is a mixture of}} hydrocarbons (HCs) with broad molecular weight distribution, it could be simply fractionated into some certain fractions by batch distillation. Distillate containing hydrocarbons with small molecules was mainly focused as an alternative carbon source for synthesis of CNPs. A two-stage furnace was employed for evaporating a mixture of distillated <b>slop</b> oil and ferrocene at 200 °C in the 1 st stage of the furnace and then formation of CNPs at 900 °C could be observed in the 2 nd stage. Laboratory-grade ferrocene was mixed with <b>slop</b> oil with a designated weight-ratio of 1 : 2. Microscopic analyses based on SEM and TEM micrographs reveals that CNPs obtained from distillated <b>slop</b> oil mostly consist of bundles of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with nominal diameters of 20 - 50 nm. Raman spectroscopic analyses of the synthesized CNPs exhibit the notably high value of IG/ID, suggesting that the synthesized CNPs preferably consist of graphitic nanostructure. Moreover, TGA analysis shows that 39. 8 and 32. 9 wt % of Fe contents exist in the CNP samples synthesized from original <b>slop</b> oil and distillated <b>slop</b> oil, respectively...|$|R

He saw too much of the artist in his own work such as Bruce Conner-like paintings and Johnson's photographic impersonation of tennis champion Jimmy Connors. He perceives the nostalgia as somewhat autobiographical and possibly fictionalized. He perceived part of the work as graffiti and felt the work was unchallenging. Artner described Cosmic <b>Slops,</b> which featured 11 paintings of black soap and wax, plus one simulacrum of a Constructivist canvas made of an animal pelt with glittery ribbons, as descendants of century of history of monochromatic abstractions that discards by titling his work as representations of the heavens. Artner feels these sculptural waxes are inferior to encaustic paintings in terms of artistic quality despite their three-dimensionality. In 2008 he continued to view Johnson less seriously as an artist but felt his work had attitude. [...] However, some experts spoke highly of Johnson's work in the same newspaper during its run.

40|$|Abstract	 Offshore {{oil and gas}} {{drilling}} operations generates <b>slop</b> water, {{which are}} formed when wastewater originating from multiple sources becomes contaminated with drilling fluid components {{and have to be}} disposed or treated prior to discharge in compliance with local discharge regulations. The logistics and treatment of <b>slop</b> water have been suggested to represent {{a significant part of the}} life-cycle environmental footprint of offshore drilling operations but poorly understood due to lack of information regarding volumes, sources and technology descriptions to properly model <b>slop</b> waste treatment technologies with life-cycle assessment. In this thesis, the environmental impacts of offshore injection disposal and a range of <b>slop</b> water treatment technology options applied offshore and onshore for the treatment of different types and volumes of <b>slop</b> water were evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA). The offshore treatment technological set-ups were filtration, dissolved air flotation (DAF) and centrifuge based treatment technologies, while the onshore treatment system involves a combination of chemical and physical treatment processes. The sources, characteristics and volume estimates of <b>slop</b> water treated by the identified treatment technologies were described based on four wells scenarios drilled within the Norwegian continental shelf which includes a normal, deep-water, and high pressure high temperature (HPHT) well, all of which were partly drilled with an oil based mud (OBM) and an arctic well drilled using only water based mud (WBM). The results of the study showed that offshore treatment of <b>slop</b> is a better alternative to offshore injection and onshore treatment with the DAF system emerging as the best alternative overall. When <b>slop</b> cannot be handled at source on the rig, onshore treatment will be a better alternative to offshore injection. The disposal or recycling of oil present in <b>slop</b> water has a significant effect on the environmental performance of the treatment systems. A comparison of the normal well with the three other well scenarios highlighted that the HPHT and deep-water have relatively higher impacts due to the high volumes of <b>slop</b> water generated by both wells. The significant impact contributions of logistics when <b>slop</b> water is sent onshore was highlighted by the deep-water and arctic well scenarios which both has the longest distance from field to shore. The arctic well scenario offshore treatment impacts were the lowest due to the use of WBM only for drilling, thereby highlighting the significant effect of OBM use on <b>slop</b> water treatment impacts. The benefits of using natural gas and onshore electricity (where applicable) instead of diesel as a source of energy when handling <b>slop</b> offshore was also demonstrated by sensitivity analysis. The findings of this study offers new and useful information that allows for the better assessment of offshore <b>slop</b> water management options which also serves as a useful input in the decision objectives used by stakeholders for the overall environmental evaluation of offshore drilling activities...|$|R

40|$|Slag {{formation}} plays {{a decisive}} {{role in all}} steelmaking processes. In top-blowing Basic Oxygen Steelmaking (BOS), i. e. in the LD process, an emulsion consisting of liquid slag, dispersed metal droplets and solid particles will, together with process gases, form an expanding foam. Extensive research has defined the parameters that govern the foaming characteristics of BOS slag emulsions. It is a well known fact that certain process conditions will lead to an excessive foam growth, forcing the foam out through the vessel opening (mouth). This process event {{is commonly known as}} <b>slopping.</b> <b>Slopping</b> results in loss of valuable metal, equipment damage, lost production time and pollution. A literature survey covering the <b>slopping</b> phenomena has been carried out, as well as a deeper investigation into the causes behind <b>slopping</b> on the BOS vessels, type LD/LBE, at SSAB EMEA Metallurgy Luleå, equipped with an automatic system for <b>slopping</b> registration using image analysis. Good slag formation and foam-growth control in order to avoid <b>slopping</b> is primarily accomplished by taking preventive "static" measures. Improved <b>slopping</b> control has been achieved by developing a new oxygen lance control scheme, featuring adjustment of the distance between the lance tip and the metal bath according to scrap quality and ore additions. If "static" measures cannot be effectuated, in-blow control measures are needed. For such "dynamic" measures to be effective, it is necessary to have a system for <b>slopping</b> prediction. In the early- 1980 s a system for foam level and <b>slopping</b> control, based on BOS vessel vibration, was temporarily installed and tested on one of the vessels in Luleå. Based on the experiences from these tests it was decided to re-investigate the vessel vibration measurement technique. Trials on industrial scale BOS vessels of type LD/LBE have been carried out. FFT spectrum analysis has been applied in order to find the frequency band with best correlation to an estimated foam height. The results show that there is a correlation between vessel vibration and foam height which can be used for dynamic foam level and <b>slopping</b> control. The vessel vibration results have been tested against perhaps the most common implemented technique for dynamic foam height estimation and <b>slopping</b> control, the audiometric system. Parallel vibration and audio measurements have been carried out on a 130 -tonne as well as on 300 -tonne BOS vessels. The results show that during stable process conditions there is good agreement between the two methods with regard to foam height estimation and that combining the two methods will provide a powerful <b>slopping</b> prediction and control system.
