40|$|International audienceMulti-modal {{characterization}} of polycrystalline materials by combined use of three-dimensional (3 D) X-ray diffraction and imaging techniques {{may be considered}} as the 3 D equivalent of surface studies in the electron microscope combining diffraction and other imaging modalities. Since acquisition times at synchrotron sources are nowadays compatible with four-dimensional (time lapse) studies, suitable mechanical testing devices are needed which enable switching between these different imaging modalities {{over the course of}} a mechanical test.

40|$|Destructive {{earthquakes}} nucleate {{at depth}} (10 - 15 km), therefore monitoring active faults at the Earth’s surface, or interpreting seismic waves, yields only limited information on earthquake mechanics. Tectonic pseudotachylytes (solidified friction-induced melts) decorate some exhumed ancient faults and remain, up to now, the only fault rocks {{recognized as the}} unambiguous <b>signature</b> of seismic <b>slip.</b> It follows that pseudotachylyte-bearing fault networks might retain {{a wealth of information}} on seismic faulting and earthquake mechanics. In this contribution, we will show {{that in the case of}} large exposures of pseudotachylyte-bearing faults, as the glacier-polished outcrops in the Adamello massif (Southern Alps, Italy), we might constrain several earthquake source parameters by linking field studies with microstructural observations, high-velocity rock friction experiments, modeling of the shear heating and melt flow, and dynamic rupture models. In particular, it is possible to estimate the rupture directivity and the fault dynamic shear resistance. We conclude that the structural analysis of exhumed pseudotachylyte-bearing faults is a powerful tool to the reconstruction of the earthquake source mechanics, complementary to seismological investigations,...|$|R
50|$|Withdrawals {{normally}} {{required the}} account holder {{to visit the}} branch where the account was held, where a credit slip or withdrawal slip would be prepared and signed. If the account holder was not known to the teller, the <b>signature</b> on the <b>slip</b> and the authorities would be checked against the signature card at the branch, before money was paid out. In the 1980s, banks adopted the black light signature system for passbooks, which enabled withdrawals to be made from passbooks at a branch {{other than the one}} where an account was opened, unless prior arrangements were made to transfer the signature card to the other branch. Under this system, the passbook's owner would sign {{in the back of the}} passbook in an invisible ink and the signing authorities would also be noted. At the paying branch, the signature on the withdrawal slip would be checked against the signature in the book, which required a special ultraviolet reader to read. Nowadays, customer verification is more likely to be by PIN and commonly from an automated teller machine.|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} for identifying past slip events in strike-slip fault systems without geological markers is presented. A 2 -D distinct element modeling code {{is used to}} simulate the stress distribution around a strike-slip fault zone after a major slip event. Mature and immature fault zones are investigated. Slip on the fault is responsible for stress rotations near the active fault strand. Series of experiments reveal that the stress deflections are qualitatively the same whatever the fault strike, fault friction, and far-field differential stresses. For a left-lateral fault, stresses are rotated clockwise in the two compressive quadrants near the fault tips and counterclockwise in the two extensive quadrants. The stress field <b>signature</b> of a <b>slip</b> event thus highlights {{the extent of the}} active fault strand. Conversely, the reconstruction of paleostress fields through inversion of minor striated faults that commonly follow slip on the master fault and the analysis of their deflections allow recognition of the fault strands that slipped in a close or remote past. Application to the left-lateral Pontarlier Fault Zone in the Jura fold-and-thrust belt (France), Late Cenozoic in age, shows that the fault activity has migrated northward, in agreement with the in-sequence development of the mountain belt. 8 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|Rodents use active whisker {{movements}} {{to explore their}} environment. The ‘slip hypothesis’ of whisker-related tactile perception entails that short-lived kinematic events (abrupt whisker movements, called ‘slips’, due to bioelastic whisker properties that occur during active touch of textures) carry the decisive texture information. Supporting this hypothesis, previous {{studies have shown that}} slip amplitude and frequency occur in a texture dependent way. Further, experiments employing passive pulsatile whisker deflections revealed that perceptual performance based on pulse kinematics (i. e. <b>signatures</b> that resemble <b>slips)</b> is far superior to the one based on time-integrated variables like frequency and intensity. So far, pulsatile stimuli were employed in a noise free environment. However, the realistic scenario involves background noise (e. g. evoked by rubbing across the texture). Therefore, if slips are used for tactile perception, the tactile neuronal system would need to differentiate slip-evoked spikes from those evoked by noise. To test the animals under these more realistic conditions, we presented passive whisker-deflections to head-fixed trained rats, consisting of 'slip-like' events (waveforms mimicking slips occurring with touch of real textures) embedded into background noise. Varying the i) shapes (ramp or pulse), ii) kinematics (amplitude, velocity, etc.), and iii) the probabilities of occurrence of slip-like events, we observed that rats could readily detect slip-like events of different shapes against noisy background. Psychophysical curves revealed that the difference of slip event and noise amplitude determined perception, while increased probability of occurrence (frequency) had barely any effect. These results strongly support the notion that encoding of kinematics dominantly determines whisker-related tactile perception while the computation of frequency or intensity plays a minor role...|$|R
40|$|Earthquakes that rupture the Earth’s surface are {{typically}} {{the most damaging}} and highlight the need for us to better constrain the style of deformation and frictional behaviour of fault zones in the shallow crust. This thesis presents two studies of natural, seismogenic, shallow crustal fault zones: 1) the Gubbio fault zone, which has been exhumed from 2. 5 - 3 km depth and deforms a mixture of limestone and phyllosilicate-rich marly limestone; and 2) the Masada fault zone, which deforms near-surface, poorly lithified lake sediments. Field studies were complemented by low- and high-velocity rotary shear experiments to constrain the frictional behaviours of the naturally observed fault gouges under representative conditions. In addition, microstructural analyses of both naturally- and experimentally-produced fault rocks were performed in order to constrain the deformation mechanisms operating during fault slip. Our {{results show that the}} dominant deformation mechanisms operating within a fault zone, which are highly variable depending on environmental conditions such as depth, fault rock composition, fluid presence and composition, and strain-rate, will control: 1) fault zone architecture and therefore the distribution of seismicity; and 2) slip zone processes, which can subsequently affect the frictional behaviour of a fault, and also determine whether or not <b>signatures</b> of seismic <b>slip</b> are produced during rupture propagation. These are useful tools for geologists when trying to decipher the seismic history of natural faults. Frictional behaviour, in terms of the likelihood of rupture propagation through the shallow crust, is also found to vary significantly {{as a function of the}} aforementioned environmental conditions. A fuller knowledge of spatial, and possible temporal, variations in fault zone properties is therefore essential if more accurate earthquake forecasting models and assessments of their associated hazards are to be produced. ...|$|R
40|$|Unequivocal {{geological}} <b>signatures</b> of seismic <b>slip</b> are rare, exceptionally so in carbonate-hosted faults where carbonate minerals dissociate {{at temperatures}} {{lower than those}} required for producing a friction melt. This thermal dissociation leads to significant fault weakening by increased fluid pressure and/or nanoparticle lubrication, preventing further heating of the fault surface. Pseudotachylyte is therefore unlikely to form in carbonate-hosted faults, and other evidence for seismic slip must be identified. We studied the lower Cambrian Naukluft Thrust which crops out in central Namibia. It contains a cataclastic dolomite fault rock, referred to as “gritty dolomite”, which we interpret as a signature of coseismic carbonate dissociation and subsequent fluid–rock interactions. The fault was active at ambient temperatures below 200 °C. “Gritty dolomite” contains: rounded, low aspect ratio dolomite clasts with a uniform Fe-rich dolomite coating, euhedral to subhedral magnetite, quartz, and K-feldspar in a fine-grained, massive to laminated carbonate matrix of particulate dolomite and crystalline calcite cement. The fault rock texture, combined with evidence of injectites of gritty dolomite into the wallrock, indicates the cataclasite deformed as a fluidized granular flow. At seismic slip velocities, frictional heating caused dissociation of dolomite to CO 2 and Ca-, Fe- and Mg-oxides. This release of CO 2 decreased the pH of the pore fluid in the fault, causing dissolution and rounding of dolomite clasts within an inertial grain flow, and precipitation of carbonate coatings and euhedral silicates and oxides during subsequent cooling and CO 2 escape. Examples of similar rocks having some, {{if not all of}} these characteristics have been described from other carbonate-hosted faults. The geological setting of the Naukluft Thrust is unique in spatial extent and quality of exposure, allowing us to eliminate alternative hypotheses for sources of CO 2 to drive fluidization...|$|R

Unlike his brother Chris, Kyle shows a lack of a conscience. He rarely feels bad or guilty about anything he does. When he admits to smoking for $5 his dad expresses that he is disappointed in Kyle, Kyle merely shrugs and goes back to eating dinner. As an April Fool's joke he pushes a postman down the stairs, and laughs as he tells his brothers about it. He frequently hangs around with his younger brother T.J., whom he often convinces to do stupid things. He shows signs of selfishness, for example, the time when he and T.J. stole a game from a Christmas charity for kids and decided they want it for themselves, after a touching appeal on TV for presents, T.J. is convinced to give it back while Kyle simply states [...] "wow...they almost had me". Also, when he gets his first girlfriend, he decides to take her out instead of going out with T.J. like he promised. Despite his misbehavior, he appears to be more mischievous rather than malicious. He does have a softer side, as seen by his willingness to quit smoking to help his dad quit, and also his baking of brownies for a girl he is smitten with. His favorite phrase is [...] "Kyle Rules" [...] as he spray paints it everywhere including on an elephant as a Halloween prank. He gets into lots of trouble in school resulting in detention nearly every day yet forging his dads <b>signature</b> on the <b>slip</b> to avoid being found out. He is reckless and proud.|$|R
