There are nineteenth century louvred paired cusped bell-lights and a corbelled embattled parapet. The tower contains a fine peal of bells, with {{the oldest of}} the original set of six being cast in 1749 by Rudhall bell foundry. Two were added in 1886, when the bell chamber was renovated. Two more were added to mark the new millennium in 2000, when <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were recast or tuned. The work was completed by Spring 2001.

25|$|Many {{thousands}} of madrigals {{were written in}} Italy in the 1550s; the entire repertoire {{has yet to be}} studied exhaustively. Some famous names of the period, besides Rore, are Palestrina, who wrote some secular music early in his career; the young Orlande de Lassus, who wrote many well-known examples, including the highly experimental and chromatic Prophetiae Sibyllarum, and who, on moving to Munich in 1556, began the history of madrigal composition outside of Italy; and Philippe de Monte, the most prolific of all madrigal composers, whose first publication dates from 1554. In style, the madrigals of the 1550s varied from the conservative and elegant style of Palestrina and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> working in Rome, to the highly chromatic and expressive work by Lassus, Rore, and others working in the cities of northern Italy.|$|E
25|$|Tension {{between members}} of the band continued, however. Along with musical differences, drug use became a problem, and Santana was deeply worried that it was {{affecting}} the band's performance. Coke Escovedo encouraged Santana to take more control of the band's musical direction, much {{to the dismay of}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> who thought that the band and its sound was a collective effort. Also, financial irregularities were exposed while under the management of Stan Marcum, whom Bill Graham criticized as being incompetent. Growing resentments between Santana and Michael Carabello over lifestyle issues resulted in his departure on bad terms. James Mingo Lewis was hired at the last minute as a replacement at a concert in New York City. David Brown later left due to substance abuse problems. A South American tour was cut short in Lima, Peru, due to unruly fans and to student protests against U.S. governmental policies. The madness of the tour convinced Santana that changes needed {{to be made in the}} band and in his life.|$|E
25|$|On 22 June 1810 Ortenzia was off {{the coast}} of Calabria. When , Commander John Toup Nicholas, arrived, Blaquiere {{informed}} Toup that a French convoy of 51 vessels were anchored off Cirella, a small town some 30 miles south of the Gulf of Policastro. The next day Pilot and Ortenzia came up under sweeps, the wind being calm, and observed that the convoy was under the escort of five settees and eight gunboats. Ortensia, assisted by boats from Pilot chased the convoy, firing on it. The British succeeded in causing five of the largest merchant vessels to run ashore north of the town and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> to seek refuge under a battery. However, the arrival of more escorts and the tiredness of the British sailors, who had been at the sweeps for nine hours, led Toup to call off the attack. In the evening Pilots boats tried to destroy the vessels on the beach, but heavy small arms fire drove them off. Pilot and Ortenzia then destroyed the vessels with gunfire. British casualties included three men killed.|$|E

Laura Leonard of Christianity Today, supports Clay's view and goes further to say [...] "it was frustrating to see this one painful narrative represent Christian faith on OITNB, a show that masters other aspects of the melting pot so well", speaking about Doggett's background story and conflict with Chapman. Two critics for The A.V. Club also gave negative reviews of Doggett; Todd VanDerWerff says that [...] "Pennsatucky never really comes together as a character {{in the same way as}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> on the show" [...] and Myles McNutt opted to criticize the storyline of the final episode of the first season specifically, saying that it [...] " [...] her like a cartoon villain instead of a real character".

[...] Nevertheless, all three members of Nirvana—singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic, and drummer Dave Grohl—later expressed dissatisfaction {{with the sound of}} the album, citing its production as too polished. [...] Early in 1992, Cobain told Rolling Stone that he was sure that the band's next album would showcase [...] "both of the extremes" [...] of its sound, saying [...] "it'll be more raw with some songs and more candy pop on <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> [...] It won't be as one-dimensional [...] ". [...] Cobain wanted to start work on the album in the summer of 1992, but the band was unable as Cobain and his bandmates lived in different cities, and as the singer and his wife, Courtney Love, were expecting the birth of their daughter, Frances Bean. [...] DGC had hoped to have a new album by the band ready for a late-1992 holiday season release; since work on it proceeded slowly, the label released the compilation album Incesticide in December 1992.|$|E
