5|$|During {{this time}} Ellet {{published}} several books. In 1839 she wrote The Characters of <b>Schiller,</b> a critical {{essay on the}} writer Friedrich <b>Schiller</b> including her translation {{of many of his}} poems. She wrote Scenes in the Life of Joanna of Sicily, a history of the lifestyles of female nobility, and Rambles about the Country, a lively description of the scenery she had observed in her travels through the United States, in 1840. She continued writing poems, translations and essays on European literature which she contributed to the American Monthly, the North American Review, the Southern Literary Messenger, the Southern Quarterly Review and other periodicals. Ellet wrote abundantly {{in a wide variety of}} genres.|$|E
25|$|Until 1957, {{the first}} 500 <b>Schilling</b> {{banknote}} was issued and the 5 and 10 <b>Schilling</b> notes {{were replaced by}} coins. However, although 20 <b>Schilling</b> coins were issued from 1980, the 20 <b>Schilling</b> note continued to be produced, with 5,000 <b>Schilling</b> notes added in 1988.|$|R
50|$|In 1945, the Allies {{introduced}} notes (dated 1944) in denominations of 50 groschen, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100 and 1,000 <b>Schilling.</b> The National Bank {{also introduced}} notes in 1945, in denominations of 10, 20, 100 and 1,000 <b>Schilling</b> and the allied currency with small {{values up to}} 5 <b>Schilling</b> remained valid until 1947. With the banknote reform of 1947, new notes were issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 1,000 <b>Schilling.</b> Until 1957, the first 500 <b>Schilling</b> banknote was issued and the 5 and 10 <b>Schilling</b> notes were replaced by coins.

25|$|The <b>Schilling</b> was {{established}} by the <b>Schilling</b> Act (Schillingrechnungsgesetz) of December 20, 1924 {{at a rate of}} 1 <b>Schilling</b> to 10,000 Austro-Hungarian Kronen and issued on March 1, 1925. The <b>Schilling</b> was abolished {{in the wake of the}} Anschluss (1938), when it was exchanged at a rate of 2 German Reichsmark to 3 <b>Schilling.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Schiller</b> then showed demos of Infinity Blade III to {{demonstrate}} the A7's processing power and the device's camera using untouched photographs. The release of iOS 7 on September 18, 2013 was also announced during the keynote.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Gillibrand {{became a}} partner in the Manhattan office of Boies, <b>Schiller</b> & Flexner, where a client was the Philip Morris parent company Altria Group. In 2002 she {{informed}} Boies of interest in running for office and was allowed to transfer to the firm's Albany office. She left Boies in 2005 to begin her 2006 campaign for Congress.|$|E
5|$|One of Adler's {{most famous}} roles {{from this period}} was as the villain Franz Moore in Herman Fiedler's {{adaptation}} of Schiller's The Robbers, which introduced <b>Schiller</b> into Yiddish theater. On at least one occasion in 1886, he played both Franz Moore and the play's hero, Franz's brother Karl Moore: in the play they never meet.|$|E

2500|$|With {{a second}} [...] "Schilling" [...] law on November 21, 1947, new {{banknotes}} were introduced. The earlier notes could be exchanged for new notes at {{par for the}} first 150 <b>Schilling</b> and {{at a rate of}} 1 new <b>Schilling</b> for 3 old <b>Schilling</b> thereafter. Coins were not affected by this reform. The currency stabilised in the 1950s, with the <b>Schilling</b> being tied to the U.S. dollar at a rate of $1 = 26 <b>Schilling.</b> Following the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, the <b>Schilling</b> was initially tied to a basket of currencies and then, in July 1976, the <b>Schilling</b> was coupled to the German mark.|$|R
50|$|<b>Schilling</b> Lake {{is named}} for August <b>Schilling,</b> the “King of Spice”, who founded A. <b>Schilling</b> & Company in San Francisco in 1881. <b>Schilling</b> {{purchased}} the land from Julian Thorne, who purchased it from Edward Preston (attorney), who purchased it from the pioneer and lumberman, Dennis Martin.|$|R
5|$|She {{also had}} roles in {{independent}} films, playing Dawn <b>Schiller</b> {{in the true}} crime film Wonderland (2003), and as Sandra Dee in the Bobby Darin biographical drama Beyond the Sea (2004). She also portrayed Lois Lane in Superman Returns (2006), and has had roles in Straw Dogs (2011) and Still Alice (2014).|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{incorporated}} Phoenix's brightest star, Ankaa (Alpha Phoenicis), {{and stars}} from the adjacent constellation Sculptor to depict Bakui, a net for catching birds. Phoenix and the neighbouring constellation of Grus together were seen by Julius <b>Schiller</b> as portraying Aaron the High Priest. These two constellations, along with nearby Pavo and Tucana, {{are called the}} Southern Birds.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{universities}} in London {{are outside the}} University of London system, including Brunel University, Imperial College London, Kingston University, London Metropolitan University, University of East London, University of West London, University of Westminster, London South Bank University, Middlesex University, and University of the Arts London (the largest university of art, design, fashion, communication and the performing arts in Europe). In addition there are three international universities in London– Regent's University London, Richmond, The American International University in London and <b>Schiller</b> International University.|$|E
25|$|In December 1923 the Austrian Parliament {{authorised}} {{the government}} to issue silver 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000-kronen coins which were to be designated half-Schilling, <b>Schilling,</b> and double <b>Schilling.</b> The <b>Schilling</b> became the official currency of Austria currency on 20 December 1924, {{at a rate of}} 10,000 Kronen to 1 <b>Schilling.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Schilling</b> (German: Österreichischer <b>Schilling)</b> was the {{currency}} of Austria from 1925 to 1938 and from 1945 to 1999, and the circulating currency until 2002. The euro was introduced at a fixed parity of [...] €1 = 13.7603 <b>Schilling</b> to replace it. The <b>Schilling</b> was divided into 100 Groschen.|$|R

5|$|After the Russian Revolution, {{universities}} were opened to women, allowing Rand {{to be in}} the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University. At the age of 16, she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy, majoring in history. At the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato, who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively. She also studied the philosophical works of Friedrich Nietzsche. Able to read French, German and Russian, Rand also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, and Friedrich <b>Schiller,</b> who became her perennial favorites.|$|E
5|$|Experimental mercury vapor {{turbines}} {{were installed}} {{to increase the}} efficiency of fossil-fuel electrical power plants. The South Meadow power plant in Hartford, CT employed mercury as its working fluid, in a binary configuration with a secondary water circuit, {{for a number of years}} starting in the late 1920s in a drive to improve plant efficiency. Several other plants were built, including the <b>Schiller</b> Station in Portsmouth, NH, which went online in 1950. The idea did not catch on industry-wide due to the weight and toxicity of mercury, as well as the advent of supercritical steam plants in later years.|$|E
5|$|German {{literature}} can {{be traced}} back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich <b>Schiller,</b> Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level. The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their Deutsches Wörterbuch, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.|$|E
50|$|On 19 August 2003, Beust {{dismissed}} his vice-mayor, Ronald <b>Schill,</b> {{causing a}} scandal. Beust had earlier dismissed Walter Wellinghausen, senator {{of the interior}} and <b>Schill's</b> most important official, without consulting <b>Schill</b> beforehand. This was due to public allegations of misconduct on Wellinghausen's part. In a private conversation, <b>Schill</b> then demanded that Beust take back the dismissal, allegedly using personal threats. Beust then decided to dismiss <b>Schill</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|<b>Schilling</b> Lake {{was named}} for John <b>Schilling,</b> a pioneer settler.|$|R
25|$|Newspapers were {{evenly divided}} in {{endorsing}} <b>Schilling</b> over Hare, with the Chicago Tribune and the Sauk Valley News among those supporting <b>Schilling.</b> In October 2010 <b>Schilling</b> {{was endorsed by}} the Chicago Tribune.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the next}} decades, Adler would play in (or, in some cases, merely produce) {{numerous}} plays by Gordin, but also classics by Shakespeare, <b>Schiller,</b> Lessing; Eugène Scribe's La Juive; dramatizations of George du Maurier's Trilby and Alexandre Dumas, fils' Camille; and {{the works of}} modern playwrights such as Gorky, Ibsen, Shaw, Strindberg, Gerhart Hauptmann, Victor Hugo, Victorien Sardou, and Leonid Andreyev. Frequently {{the works of the}} great contemporary playwrights—even Shaw, who was writing in English—would be staged in New York in Yiddish years, even decades, before they were ever staged there in English.|$|E
5|$|Both models {{include an}} Apple A8 system-on-chip, and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s. The primary {{difference}} between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is that the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil <b>Schiller</b> touted that the A8 chip would provide, {{in comparison to the}} 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. Early hands-on reports suggested that the A8's GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s.|$|E
5|$|Abovian's poetry {{was filled}} with satire best {{expressed}} in The wine jug, in which he criticized Russian bureaucracy. Leisure entertainment was adapted by Abovian from notes he took in public gatherings. The work {{is a collection of}} fables in verse that chastise vice, injustice and moral degeneration. He wrote scientific and artistic non-fiction works such as the Discovery of America and Book of Stories. Abovian translated to the Armenian language the works of Homer, Goethe, Friedrich <b>Schiller,</b> Nikolay Karamzin, I. A. Krylov and others. He continued promoting secular and comprehensive (mental, moral, working, physical) training, school accessibility, free education for the indigent and equal education of boys and girls. Pedagogical compositions of Abovian include the book for reading Introduction to education (1838), a textbook of Russian grammar and an Armenian-language novel History of Tigran, or a moral manual for the Armenian children (printed in 1941). He was the first Armenian to study scientific ethnography: the way of life and customs of the peasants of the native settlements around Kanaker, inhabitants of Yerevan, and gathered and studied Armenian and Kurdish folklore.|$|E
5|$|<b>Schilling</b> {{signed with}} the Seattle Seahawks on March 20, 2014. <b>Schilling</b> was placed on season-ending Injured Reserve on November 8, 2014 with a knee injury. <b>Schilling</b> opted to retire on April 2, 2015.|$|R
25|$|Between 1947 and 1952, {{coins in}} {{denominations}} of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 Groschen; and 1, 2, and 5 <b>Schilling</b> were introduced. The 2 and 50 Groschen; 1, 2, and 5 <b>Schilling</b> were struck in aluminium, {{as was the}} second type of 10 groschen coin. The 1 and 5 groschen and the first type of 10 groschen were in zinc, with the 20 groschen struck in aluminium-bronze. The 1 groschen was only struck in 1947, while the 20 groschen and 2 <b>Schilling</b> coins were suspended from production in 1954 and 1952, respectively. In 1957, silver 10 <b>Schilling</b> coins were introduced, followed in 1959 by aluminium-bronze 50 groschen and 1 <b>Schilling,</b> and in 1960 by silver 5 <b>Schilling</b> coins. Thus, the 5 <b>Schilling</b> coins went from an aluminium composition to a silver one, a highly unusual event made possible by the substantial improvement of the Austrian economy in the 1950s. Cupro-nickel replaced silver in the 5 and 10 <b>Schilling</b> coins in 1969 and 1974, respectively. An aluminium-bronze 20 <b>Schilling</b> coin was introduced in 1980.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Schilling</b> was reintroduced after World War II on November 30, 1945 by the Allied Military, who issued {{paper money}} (dated 1944) in {{denominations}} of 50 Groschen up to 100 <b>Schilling.</b> The exchange rate to the Reichsmark was 1:1, limited to 150 <b>Schilling</b> per person. The Nationalbank also began issuing <b>Schilling</b> notes in 1945 {{and the first}} coins were issued in 1946.|$|R
5|$|Based on {{a decree}} by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German {{subjects}} who {{collaborated with the}} French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set {{on his head and}} he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance Friedrich <b>Schiller,</b> Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.|$|E
5|$|Heliade {{was aware}} of the often {{negative}} response to his work: in a poem dedicated to the memory of Friedrich <b>Schiller,</b> he expanded on the contrast between creation and social setting (in reference to mankind, it stressed Te iartă să faci răul, iar binele nici mort—"They forgive the evil committed against them, but never the good"). A noted author of satire, he used it as a vehicle to criticize social customs of his day, as well as to publicize personal conflicts and resentments. As a maverick, he attacked political figures on both sides: conservatives who mimicked liberalism were the subject of his Areopagiul bestielor ("The Areopagus of the Beasts"), while many other of his post-1848 prose and poetry pieces mocked people on the left wing of liberalism, most notably C. A. Rosetti and his supporters. During and after his exile, his conflicts with Cezar Bolliac and Ion Ghica also made the latter two the target of irony, most likely based on Heliade's belief that they intended to downplay his contributions to the Wallachian Revolution of 1848.|$|E
5|$|Her parents, Franciszek Ksawery Plater and Anna von der Mohl (Anna z Mohlów), {{divorced}} {{when she was}} nine years old, in 1815. She was brought up by distant relatives, Michał Plater-Zyberk and Izabela Helena Syberg zu Wischling, in their family's manor Līksna near Daugavpils (Dźwina), then Inflanty (now Latvia). Well-educated, Plater was brought up to appreciate the efforts of Tadeusz Kościuszko and the Prince Józef Poniatowski. She was fascinated by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich <b>Schiller,</b> who she could read in the original German language. She was raised {{in an environment that}} valued the history of Poland, and her literary heroes included Princess Wanda and Adam Mickiewicz's Grażyna. She also admired Bouboulina, a woman who became one of the icons of the Greek uprising against the Ottomans, a Polish fighter Anna Dorota Chrzanowska, as well as Joan of Arc. These pursuits were accompanied by an early interest in equestrianism and marksmanship, quite uncommon for early 19th-century girls from aristocratic families. She was also deeply interested in Ruthenian and Belarusian folk culture. She had contacts and friends in the Filaret Association.|$|E
5000|$|Curt <b>Schilling,</b> of the Boston Red Sox. His {{family lives}} on Woodridge Road in a 26 acre estate {{formerly}} occupied by another athlete, Drew Bledsoe. <b>Schilling</b> bought {{the home in}} 2003 for $4,500,001. In 2008 a baseball field, behind the Middle School was dedicated [...] "Curt <b>Schilling</b> Field" [...] and a softball field {{in the same place}} was dedicated [...] "Shonda <b>Schilling</b> Field".|$|R
5000|$|Robert Frederick <b>Schilling,</b> M.D. (1919 - [...] 30 September 2014) was a {{physician}} {{best known for}} his research on Vitamin B12. <b>Schilling</b> was a Professor Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin. He is the namesake of the <b>Schilling</b> test.|$|R
25|$|The Austrian <b>schilling</b> was the {{currency}} of Austria between 1924 and 1938 and again between 1945 and 2002. It {{was replaced by the}} euro at a fixed parity of €1 = 13.7603 <b>schilling.</b> The <b>schilling</b> was divided into 100 groschen.|$|R
