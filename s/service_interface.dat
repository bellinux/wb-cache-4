40|$|Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a {{paradigm}} for developing distributed and heterogeneous software applications {{within and across}} organizational boundaries. Choreography is a coordination model of SOA in which service collaborations to achieve a common goal are described from global point of view. One {{of the most important}} issues in SOA is identifying required <b>services</b> and their <b>interfaces.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>interfaces</b> are necessary for searching required organization services or developing them from scratch. Because of involving key information of <b>service</b> <b>interfaces</b> in choreography, it can be used in generation of <b>service</b> <b>interfaces.</b> This paper presents an algorithm for automatic <b>interface</b> generation of <b>service</b> <b>interfaces</b> from several choreographies using ontology. Ontology assists to conceptualize a specific domain of knowledge. This method helps developers to facilitate, automate and speedup a part of development process of SOA-based software systems...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>service</b> <b>interface</b> in SOP is an in-memory {{object that}} {{describes}} a well-defined software task with well-defined {{input and output}} data structures. Service interfaces can be grouped into packages.

Furthermore, service interfaces can be assigned to one or many service groups based on shared properties.|$|E

By using <b>service</b> <b>interfaces</b> for information hiding, SOP extends the service-oriented design principles used in SOA to achieve separation of concerns across in-memory service modules.|$|R
