25|$|The {{internal}} {{elements of}} tubes {{have always been}} connected to external circuitry via pins at their base which plug into a socket. Subminiature tubes were produced using wire leads rather than sockets, however these were restricted to rather specialized applications. In addition to the connections {{at the base of}} the tube, many early triodes connected the grid using a metal cap at the top of the tube; this reduces <b>stray</b> <b>capacitance</b> between the grid and the plate leads. Tube caps were also used for the plate (anode) connection, particularly in transmitting tubes and tubes using a very high plate voltage.|$|E
25|$|The {{specialized}} transformer {{used in the}} Tesla coil circuit, {{called a}} resonant transformer, oscillation transformer or radio-frequency (RF) transformer, functions differently from an ordinary transformer used in AC power circuits. While an ordinary transformer is designed to transfer energy efficiently from primary to secondary winding, the resonant transformer is also designed to temporarily store electrical energy. Each winding has a capacitance across it and functions as an LC circuit (resonant circuit, tuned circuit), storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to a tuning fork. The primary coil (L1) consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a capacitor (C1) through the spark gap (SG). The secondary coil (L2) consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of fine wire on a hollow cylindrical form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an LC circuit, the inductance of (L2) resonates with <b>stray</b> <b>capacitance</b> (C2), {{the sum of the}} stray parasitic capacitance between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the toroidal metal electrode attached to the high voltage terminal. The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, they have the same resonant frequency. This allows them to exchange energy, so the oscillating current alternates {{back and forth between the}} primary and secondary coils.|$|E
500|$|PWM drives are {{inherently}} associated with high-frequency common-mode voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings. When these high-frequency voltages find {{a path to}} earth through a bearing, transfer of metal or electrical discharge machining (EDM) sparking occurs between the bearing's ball and the bearing's race. Over time, EDM-based sparking causes erosion in the bearing race {{that can be seen}} as a fluting pattern. In large motors, the <b>stray</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the windings provides paths for high-frequency currents that pass through the motor shaft ends, leading to a circulating type of bearing current. [...] Poor grounding of motor stators can lead to shaft-to-ground bearing currents. Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high-frequency bearing currents.|$|E

5000|$|For {{wide-range}} bias tees, the inductor must {{be large}} {{at the lowest}} frequency. A large inductor will have a <b>stray</b> <b>capacitance</b> (which creates its self-resonant frequency).

40|$|Several signal {{processing}} approaches {{have been developed}} to overcome the effect of <b>stray</b> <b>capacitances</b> in Electrical Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (EBIS) measurements. EBIS measurements obtained with textile-enabled instrumentation are more vulnerable to <b>stray</b> <b>capacitances.</b> Currently, the most widespread approach for correcting the effect of <b>stray</b> <b>capacitances</b> in EBIS is the time delay (Td) compensation method, which also has several drawbacks. In this study, the Td method is revisited and its limitations and its lack of a scientific basis are demonstrated. To determine better ways to overcome the effect of <b>stray</b> <b>capacitances,</b> a simplified measurement model is proposed that is based on previous models of artefacts in EBIS measurements described in the literature. The model consists of a current divider with a parasitic capacitance (Cpar) in parallel with the load. Cpar creates a pathway for the measurement current to leak away from the load, provoking a capacitive leakage effect. In this thesis, three approaches with different limitations are proposed to overcome the capacitive leakage effect. The first approach estimates Cpar and subtracts it from the measurements, thus finding the load. Cpar can be estimated because the susceptance of biological tissue is null at infinite frequency. Therefore, at high frequencies, the susceptance of the tissue can be neglected, and the slope of the susceptance of the measurement is Cpar. The accuracy of Cpar depends on the maximum frequency measured and the value of Cpar. Therefore, it may not be possible to accurately estimate small values of Cpar in the typical frequency ranges used in EBIS. The second and third approaches use the Cole fitting process to estimate the Cole parameters, which form the basis for most EBIS applications. Because the conductance of the measurement is free from the effect of Cpar, performing Cole fitting on the conductance avoids the effect of Cpar in the fitting process. With a poor skin-electrode contact, this approach may not be sufficiently accurate. The third approach would be to perform the Cole fitting on the modulus with a reduced upper frequency limit because the modulus and the low-medium frequencies are very robust against the effect of artefacts. In this approach, a slight capacitive leakage effect is unavoidable. Since it is common to find tainted measurements, especially among those obtained with textile-enabled instrumentation, it is important to find viable methods to avoid their effect. The three methods studied showed that they could reduce the effect of tainted measurements. QC 2012031...|$|R

All actual circuit elements such as inductors, diodes, and transistors have internal capacitance, which can cause their behavior to depart from that of 'ideal' circuit elements.
