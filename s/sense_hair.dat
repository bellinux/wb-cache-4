40|$|Looping {{behavior}} of minnows aboard Skylab 3 is analyzed. Extensive looping patterns were observed at first {{look on the}} third day of weightlessness; thereafter, the frequency of the looping episodes diminished until complete adaptation on the twenty-first day, at which time the fish oriented themselves with their backs to the light. The swimming anomaly could be due to (1) absence of continuous bending of <b>sense</b> <b>hairs</b> to a certain extent by gravity, causing the fish to tilt forward in an attempt to increase leverage on the hairs - in the absence of all gravity, tilting is continued into looping (this hypothesis is supported by parabolic flight experiments with partial gravity, in which only tilting was seen); or (2) an attempt by the fish to create a gravitoinertial stimulus by 'centrifuging' its otoliths by looping...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUsing {{measurements}} {{based on}} particle image velocimetry {{in combination with}} a novel compact theoretical framework to describe hair mechanics, we found that spider and cricket air motion <b>sensing</b> <b>hairs</b> work close to the physical limit of sensitivity and energy transmission in {{a broad range of}} relatively high frequencies. In this range, the hairs closely follow the motion of the incoming flow because a minimum of energy is dissipated by forces acting in their basal articulation. This frequency band is located beyond the frequency at which the angular displacement of the hair is maximum which is between about 40 and 600 Hz, depending on hair length (Barth et al. [1] Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 340, 445 - 461 (doi: 10. 1098 / rstb. 1993. 0084)).

40|$|Sound {{vibration}} is <b>sensed</b> by <b>hair</b> {{cells in}} the inner ear. The information is transmitted to the cochlear nucleus in the brainstem via spiral ganglion neurons. The information is further transmitted to higher relaying centers in the brain such as superior olivary complex and inferior colliculus.

It is known that the organization is well-established {{from the beginning of}} the circuit development. However, little is still known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of connectivity in the auditory circuit. Homeobox transcription factors of the Hox gene family are known for their involvement in early anterior-posterior axis patterning of neuronal progenitors in the hindbrain. Recent evidence indicates that they also play important roles in late aspects of neuronal development and establishment of topographic circuitry. Moreover, a mutation in the HOXA 2 gene has been recently shown to be responsible for hearing deficits in humans.

50|$|The {{objective}} of the newt experiment was to study the early development of gravity-sensing organs (see figure). The utricle and saccule are specialized organs present in the inner ears of all vertebrate animals. They contain otoliths (or otoconia), calcium carbonate stones, which are deposited on a gelatinous membrane that lies over the sensory hair cells. The pull that gravity exerts on the otoliths is <b>sensed</b> by the <b>hair</b> cells, and information about the gravitational stimulus is transmitted to the brain via connecting nerve fibers. The experiment was designed to determine whether otolith production and development of otolith-associated receptor cells and nerve fibers may be altered in the microgravity environment of space.|$|R
40|$|We study model spaces, in the <b>sense</b> of <b>Hairer,</b> for {{stochastic}} partial {{differential equations}} involving the fractional Laplacian. We {{prove that the}} fractional Laplacian is a singular kernel suitable to apply the theory of regularity structures. Our main contribution is to study the dependence of the model space for a regularity structure on the three-parameter problem involving the spatial dimension, the polynomial order of the nonlinearity, and the exponent of the fractional Laplacian. The goal is to investigate {{the growth of the}} model space under parameter variation. In particular, we prove several results in the approaching subcriticality limit leading to universal growth exponents of the regularity structure. A key role is played by the viewpoint that model spaces can be identified with families of rooted trees. Our proofs are based upon a geometrical construction similar to Newton polygons for classical Taylor series and various combinatorial arguments. We also present several explicit examples listing all elements with negative homogeneity by implementing a new symbolic software package to work with regularity structures. We use this package to illustrate our analytical results and to obtain new conjectures regarding coarse-grained network measures for model spaces.

5000|$|Echoic memory {{represents}} SM for {{the auditory}} sense of hearing. Auditory information travels as sound waves which are <b>sensed</b> by <b>hair</b> {{cells in the}} ears. Information is sent to and processed in the temporal lobe. The echoic sensory store holds information for 2-3 seconds to allow for proper processing. The first studies of echoic memory came shortly after Sperling investigated iconic memory using an adapted partial report paradigm. Today, characteristics of echoic memory have been found mainly using a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm which utilizes EEG and MEG recordings. MMN {{has been used to}} identify some of the key roles of echoic memory such as change detection and language acquisition. Change detection, or the ability to detect an unusual or possibly dangerous change in the environment independent of attention, is key to the survival of an organism. With regards to language, a characteristic of children who begin speaking late in development is reduced duration of echoic memory. In short, [...] "Echoic memory is a fast-decaying store of auditory information." [...] In the case of damage to or lesions developing on the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, or hippocampus, echoic memory will likely be shortened and/or have a slower reaction time.|$|R

40|$|We seek {{to harness}} {{microelectromechanical}} systems (MEMS) technologies to build biomimetic devices for low-power, high-performance, robust sensors and actuators on micro-autonomous robot platforms. Hair is used abundantly in nature {{for a variety}} of functions including balance and inertial sensing, flow sensing and aerodynamic (air foil) control, tactile and touch sensing, insulation and temperature control, particle filtering, and gas/chemical <b>sensing.</b> Biological <b>hairs,</b> which are typically characterized by large surface/volume ratios and mechanical amplification of movement, can be distributed in large numbers over large areas providing unprecedented sensitivity, redundancy, and stability (robustness). Local neural transduction allows for space- and power-efficient signal processing. Moreover by varying the hair structure and transduction mechanism, the basic hair form can be used for a wide diversity of functions. In this paper, by exploiting a novel wafer-level, bubble-free liquid encapsulation technology, we make arrays of micro-hydraulic cells capable of electrostatic actuation and hydraulic amplification, which enables high force/high deflection actuation and extremely sensitive detection (sensing) at low power. By attachment of cilia (hair) to the micro-hydraulic cell, air flow sensors with excellent sensitivity ( 10 m/s) have been built. A second-generation design has significantly reduced the sensor response time while maintaining sensitivity of about 2 cm/s and dynamic range of more than 15 m/s. These sensors can be used for dynamic flight control of flying robots or for situational awareness in surveillance applications. The core biomimetic technologies developed are applicable to a broad range of sensors and actuators...|$|R

The hair cell sensor was simulated using different flow rates to study the pressure and the strain distribution acting on the sensor by using computational fluid dynamic and finite element analysis approach. High performance sensor {{can be achieved by}} increasing the length of the hair cell and also using low Young Modulus material. The hair cell has been fabricated for dimension of 8000 μm length, 2000 μm width and 100 μm thickness, where the copper was chosen due to its mechanical properties. The response time for a sensor to respond completely to a change in input is about 50 m/s and the sensitivity in terms of output voltage and input flow rate is 0. 2 mV/ms- 1. Also, the result obtained in the simulation is aligned with the experimental result.

40|$|Women’s and men’s {{bodies and}} {{sexuality}} {{can be understood}} as socially-situated and socially-produced. This means they are affected by, and developed in relation to, patterned sociocultural meanings and representations. We aim here to understand a recently emergent, and potentially gendered, body practice—pubic hair removal—by examining the meanings people ascribe to pubic hair and its removal. Extending the widespread hairless bodily norm for Anglo/Western women, pubic hair removal is an apparently rapidly growing phenomenon. Men, too, are seemingly practicing pubic hair removal in significant numbers, raising the question of to what extent pubic hair removal should be understood as a gendered phenomenon. What we do not yet know is what people’s understandings and perceptions of pubic hair are, and how they make sense of its removal. Using a qualitative survey, the current study asked a series of questions about pubic hair and its removal, both in general and related to men’s and women’s bodies. In total, 67 participants (100 % response rate; 50 female; mean age 29, diverse ethnically, predominantly heterosexual) completed the survey. Thematic analysis identified five key themes in the way people made <b>sense</b> of pubic <b>hair</b> and pubic hair removal that are related to choice, privacy, physical attractiveness, sexual impacts, and cleanliness. Meanings around pubic hair and its removal were not consistently gendered, but it was still situated as more of an issue for women.

In 2003, after years of watching my skin triumph over my hair for dominance of my scalp, I surrendered by removing all surviving strands. In extensive discussions, I found that we of the shiny head fraternity have many experiences in common. Based on this collected wisdom, I offer a fair and unbiased analysis of the positives and negatives of baldhood from a man’s perspective. While I believe many of these points also apply to women, we won’t be sure until we see Sinead O’Connor’s “Forum ” letter. Let’s look at the negative first, with Three Reasons Not to Shave Your Head: 1. You have a full head of naturally colored hair. Male-pattern baldness and age-related graying limit this reason, so enjoy it while you can. 2. There is more to sunburn in summer and more to chill in winter. Hair is Mother Nature’s furry little hat, so removing it implies wearing a real hat or adding sunscreen. The good news is that it just takes seconds to add sunscreen to a hairless scalp. 3.

However, the biological effects of sound, another physical agent to which we are frequently exposed have been considerably disregarded by the scientific community. Although {{a number of studies}} suggest that emotions evoked by music may be useful in medical care, alleviating stress and nociception in patients undergoing surgical procedures as well as in cancer and burned patients, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms by which these effects occur. It is generally accepted that the mechanosensory hair cells in the ear transduce the sound-induced mechanical vibrations into neural impulses, which are interpreted by the brain and evoke the emotional effects. In the last decade; however, several studies suggest that the response to music is even more complex. Moreover, recent evidence comes out that cell types other than auditory hair cells could response to audible sound. However, what is actually <b>sensed</b> by the <b>hair</b> cells, and possible by other cells in our organism, are physical differences in fluid pressure induced by the sound waves. Therefore, there is no reasonable impediment for any cell type of our body to respond to a pure sound or to music. Hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the response of a human breast cancer cell line, MCF 7, to music. The results′ obtained suggest that music can alter cellular morpho-functional parameters, such as cell size and granularity in cultured cells.
