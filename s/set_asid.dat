40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of research of plant macrofossils from the grain deposit deriving from the 18 th/ 19 th centuries. The analysed material included 24760 diaspores representing 73 taxa. The majority were cultivated cereal crop species, and there was also abundance of accompanying segetal weed species. About 95 % of the gathered crop material was Secale cereale. Another important crop was Hordeum vulgare and there were also some remains of Avena sativa, Triticum aestivum, Fagopyrum esculentum. Cannabis sativa and Linum usitatissimum were found as well. Weeds competing with these crops were, among others, the following species: Agrostemma githago, Raphanus raphanistrum, Apera spica-venti, Bromus secalinus, Centaurea cyanus, Spergula arvensis, Thlaspi arvense, Viola arvensis/tricolor, Fallopia convolvulus, Polygonum persicaria, Mentha arvensis, Anthemis arvensis, Papaver rhoeas, Rumex acetosella, Scleranthus annuus, Aphanes arvensis, Setaria pumila, Setaria viridis/verticilata. Extremely large presence of wild plant diaspores in the material allowed conducting economic and environmental interpretations. Reconstruction methods applied, used primarily in the case of macroremains from granaries, were fully applicable to the analysed plant residues. Weed species composition in the analysed material showed that they were mostly typical for the main winter crop. Some amount of species typical for other habitats were also found and they probably came from the near-by rye field. The presence of perennial diaspores indicated that the field was probably <b>set</b> <b>asid...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{numbers of}} {{displaced}} {{people in the}} world due to conflict is now the highest ever recorded. This study looks at the situation for internally displaced people in general, and in Sudan in particular with exploring specifically the livelihood situation for IDPs who lived under protracted displacement in Wad Al Bashir, a camp for internally displaced persons in Khartoum in 2007. They had come from various parts of the country, and had lived there for different amount of time, some planned to remain others dreamt of going back home. My objectives were to see what strategies they were using to make a living for themselves and their families under very difficult circumstances, and whether establishing or joining community based organisations (CBOs) were part of these coping strategies? The findings showed that their challenges were great and they were left to find new ways of living. With an estimated number of 1, 7 million IDPs in Khartoum at the time, jobs were scarce and very low paid, this was further complicated with strict imposed government legislations. Several CBOs had been set up in Wad Al Bashir, working under different capacities, however there were large potentials to expand their outreach in order to benefit more people. The vital role the CBOâ€™s played (or had the opportunity to play) could be given more recognition and support, with time they could also be self-sufficient. It was also a unique opportunity for the different tribes to come together, and work peacefully together towards the same goals. Conflicts in Sudan and South Sudan are continuing {{and as long as the}} root causes for displacement are set, the numbers of displaced are still very high and are likely to rise. The two countries has every chance to prosper and develop and will most likely do so once the power struggles are <b>set</b> <b>asid...</b>|$|E
