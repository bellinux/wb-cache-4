By creating this binding, the message recipient, {{and even a}} third party, can confidently verify that the message originated from its claimed source. This provides a useful mechanism to mitigate a number of threats. For example, a denial of service attack which attempts to tear-down an active connection by surreptitiously injecting RELEASE or DROP PARTY messages could be easily thwarted when authenticity assurances are {{in place for the}} <b>signaling</b> <b>channel.</b> <b>Signaling</b> <b>channel</b> authentication could also be used to provide the required auditing information for accurate billing which is impervious to repudiation. Finally, depending on the <b>signaling</b> <b>channel</b> authentication mechanism, end-to-end integrity of the message (or at least part of it) can be provided. None of these capabilities exist in the current specifications...|$|R

While an inband T1 seemingly has a slight advantage due to 24 lines being available to make calls (as opposed to a PRI that has 23), each channel in an inband T1 must perform its own setup and tear-down of each call. A PRI uses the 24th channel as a data channel to perform all the overhead operations of the other 23 channels (including CID and ANI). Although an inband T1 has 24 channels, the 23 channel PRI can set up more calls faster due to the dedicated 24th <b>signalling</b> <b>channel</b> (D Channel).|$|E
50|$|For a {{protocol}} that began {{life in the}} 1980s, DPNSS is natively {{a long way from}} VoIP. However, many of the hybrid VoIP PBXs available from manufacturers worldwide provide on-board DPNSS trunk cards. Where they do not, {{a protocol}} converter is necessary. Commercially available equipment offers the ability to convert from DPNSS to Q.Sig. Note that it is also possible to tunnel DPNSS and its associated PCM (G711) over an IP network. This can be point to point where the IP network carries packetised voice N x 64 Kbs speech and a separate IP <b>signalling</b> <b>channel</b> to carry the notional 64 Kbs of DPNSS signalling. A more sophisticated solution uses intelligence {{on the edge of the}} IP network to route voice to the correct node.

40|$|In this paper, after {{discussing}} the theoretical underpinnings of unconventional monetary policy measures, we review the existing empirical evidence on their effectiveness, focusing on those {{adopted by the}} European Central Bank and by the Federal Reserve. These measures operate in two ways: through the <b>signalling</b> <b>channel</b> and through the portfolio-balance channel. In the former, the central bank can use communication to steer interest rates and to restore confidence in the financial markets; the latter hinges on the hypothesis of imperfect substitutability of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet {{of the private sector}} and postulates that the central bank’s asset purchases and liquidity provision lower financial yields and improve funding conditions. The review of the empirical literature suggests that the unconventional measures were effective and that their impact on the economy was sizeable. However, a very large degree of uncertainty surrounds the precise quantification of these effects.

40|$|Abstract—Medium access {{protocols}} for HFC {{and wireless}} ATM networks often use a collision based capacity request <b>signalling</b> <b>channel</b> which may {{rely on the}} Slotted Aloha multiaccess principle. This paper studies the performance of a-persistence Slotted Aloha contention resolution algorithm (CRA), subject to extreme interstation correlation, {{by means of a}} discrete-time Markov chain analysis. We examine in detail the conditions leading to a deadlock—a situation where the time to collision resolution becomes unacceptably high and the system is practically unstable. We analyze two disaster scenario deadlock models, and study the effect of channel error probability, signalling traffic load, and the contention resolution algorithm used. We show that the key factor of the CRA is the collision rate and not channel errors. We propose and test three <b>signalling</b> <b>channel</b> capacity allocation schemes. We identify the best-performing of these three schemes as the cyclic contention mini-slot (CMS) sharing employing multiple CMSs per data slot. Finally, we demonstrate the need for implementation of an added scheme, which dynamically adjusts the-persistence parameter.

40|$|In {{response}} to financial turmoil {{that began in}} 2007 and the effective lower bound for short-term interest rates that was reached in late- 2008, the Federal Reserve adopted a raft of 'unconventional' monetary policies, notably: forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases. These policies transmit to the real economy, inter alia, via an interest rate channel, with two sub-channels: signalling and portfolio rebalancing. I apply the OIS-augmented decomposition of interest rates from Lloyd (2017 a) to identify these two sub-channels. I demonstrate that US unconventional monetary policy announcements between November 2008 and April 2013 did exert significant signalling and portfolio balance effects on financial markets, reducing longer-term interest rates. Signalling effects were particularly powerful at horizons in excess of two years. As {{a result of these}} declines, unconventional monetary policy aided real economic outcomes. I show that the <b>signalling</b> <b>channel</b> exerted a more powerful influence on US industrial production and consumer prices than portfolio rebalancing. In terms of long-term bond yield and industrial production effects, the <b>signalling</b> <b>channel</b> is associated with around two-thirds to three-quarters of the total effects attributed to the two channels...|$|E

40|$|For 3 -D {{ultrasound}} imaging, the row-column addressing (RCA) with 2 N connections for an N × N 2 -D array {{makes the}} fabrication and interconnection simpler than the fully addressing with N 2 connections. However, RCA degrades the image quality because of defocusing in <b>signal</b> <b>channel</b> {{direction in the}} transmit event. To solve this problem, a split row-column addressing scheme (SRCA) is proposed in this paper. Rather than connecting all the elements in the <b>signal</b> <b>channel</b> direction together, this scheme divides the elements in the <b>signal</b> <b>channel</b> direction into several disconnected blocks, thus enables focusing beam access in both <b>signal</b> <b>channel</b> and switch channel directions. Selecting an appropriate split scheme is the key for SRCA to maintaining a reasonable tradeoff between the image quality {{and the number of}} connections. Various split schemes for a 32 × 32 array are fully investigated with point spread function (PSF) analysis and imaging simulation. The result shows the split scheme with five blocks (4, 6, 12, 6, and 4 elements of each block) can provide similar image quality to fully addressing. The splitting schemes for different array sizes from 16 × 16 to 96 × 96 are also discussed...|$|R
