5|$|Salts of selenous acid {{are called}} selenites. These include silver <b>selenite</b> (Ag2SeO3) and sodium <b>selenite</b> (Na2SeO3).|$|E
5|$|Selenium occurs {{naturally}} {{in a number}} of inorganic forms, including selenide, selenate, and <b>selenite,</b> but these minerals are rare. The common mineral <b>selenite</b> is not a selenium mineral, and contains no <b>selenite</b> ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing {{a small part of the}} sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.|$|E
5|$|At this point, a <b>Selenite</b> (an insectoid alien {{inhabitant}} of the Moon, {{named after}} one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the <b>Selenite</b> King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.|$|E

50|$|However, Vecanoi rests at {{the base}} of Axis, where the <b>Selenites</b> dwell. The Queen of the <b>Selenites</b> (voiced by Anjelica Huston) blames Vecanoi for the {{destruction}} of their planet, and has spent most of her life (and sacrificed the future of her people) attempting to destroy it.|$|R
5|$|Tellurites can be leached {{from the}} mixture {{with water and}} are {{normally}} present as hydrotellurites HTeO3− in solution. <b>Selenites</b> are also formed during this process, {{but they can be}} separated by adding sulfuric acid. The hydrotellurites are converted into the insoluble tellurium dioxide while the <b>selenites</b> stay in solution.|$|R
5|$|Other {{polonium}} compounds include potassium polonite as a polonite, polonate, acetate, bromate, carbonate, citrate, chromate, cyanide, formate, (II) and (IV) hydroxides, nitrate, selenate, <b>selenite,</b> monosulfide, sulfate, disulfate and sulfite.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{commercial}} use of Se, accounting for about 50% of consumption, {{is for the}} production of glass. Se compounds confer a red color to glass. This color cancels out the green or yellow tints that arise from iron impurities typical for most glass. For this purpose, various <b>selenite</b> and selenate salts are added. For other applications, a red color may be desired, produced by mixtures of CdSe and CdS.|$|E
5|$|According to Méliès's recollections, much of {{the unusual}} cost of A Trip to the Moon {{was due to the}} {{mechanically}} operated scenery and the <b>Selenite</b> costumes in particular, which were made for the film using cardboard and canvas. Méliès himself sculpted prototypes for the heads, feet, and kneecap pieces in terra cotta, and then created plaster molds for them. A specialist in mask-making used these molds to produce cardboard versions for the actors to wear. One of the backdrops for the film, showing the inside of the glass-roofed workshop in which the space capsule is built, was painted to look like the actual glass-roofed studio in which the film was made.|$|E

50|$|Bedford and Cavor {{break out}} of captivity {{beneath the surface of}} the moon and flee, killing several <b>Selenites.</b> In their flight they {{discover}} that gold is common on the moon. In their attempt to find their way back to the surface and to their sphere, they come upon some <b>Selenites</b> carving up mooncalves but fight their way past. Back on the surface, they split up to search for their spaceship. Bedford finds it but returns to Earth without Cavor, who injured himself in a fall and was recaptured by the <b>Selenites,</b> as Bedford learns from a hastily scribbled note he left behind.|$|R
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of <b>selenite</b> for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E
25|$|Usually, some holes {{were left}} in the outer wall as well as bigger hollows in the <b>selenite</b> to support scaffoldings and to allow for later {{coverings}} and constructions, generally {{on the basis of}} wood.|$|E

25|$|There is {{an exhibit}} of {{numbered}} and named fossils found in 1939 at Bishopstone by beachcomber J. E. Cooper. It consists of the following 50–60 million-years-old items: sharks' teeth Stratolamia striata and Odotus obliquus; green sandstone from the Thanet Sands layer containing the tiny bivalve shell fossils Corbula regulbiensis; fossil wood and pine cones; Thanet Sand containing the bivalve shell Cucullaea decusata; fossil oyster shells Ostrea bellovacina; the large bivalve Arctica scutellaria; Arctica morrisi bivalve casts, one with shell; brown sandstone from the Oldhaven Beds layer with shark's tooth; Arctica morrisi and other bivalves in Oldhaven Beds sandstone; stems of the sea lily, which {{is related to the}} sea urchin; fossil fish backbones; Ice age mammoth tooth; sea-worn mammoth tooth; <b>selenite</b> sand roses (not fossils); <b>selenite</b> crystals from London Clay layer. These were gathered in a single day and had been washed out of the cliffs by the sea.|$|E
25|$|New {{chemical}} glass compositions or {{new treatment}} techniques can be initially investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. The {{raw materials for}} laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during {{the selection of the}} raw materials, e.g., sodium <b>selenite</b> may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as Al(OH)3 over Al2O3. Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass batch), by stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing.|$|E
25|$|One of Wheatstone's most ingenious devices was the 'Polar clock,' {{exhibited}} at {{the meeting of the}} British Association in 1848. It is based on the fact discovered by Sir David Brewster, that the light of the sky is polarised in a plane at an angle of ninety degrees from the position of the sun. It follows that by discovering that plane of polarisation, and measuring its azimuth with respect to the north, the position of the sun, although beneath the horizon, could be determined, and the apparent solar time obtained. The clock consisted of a spyglass, having a Nicol (double-image) prism for an eyepiece, and a thin plate of <b>selenite</b> for an object-glass. When the tube was directed to the North Pole—that is, parallel to the Earth's axis—and the prism of the eyepiece turned until no colour was seen, the angle of turning, as shown by an index moving with the prism over a graduated limb, gave the hour of day. The device is of little service in a country where watches are reliable; but it formed part of the equipment of the 1875–1876 North Polar expedition commanded by Captain Nares.|$|E

60|$|I {{knew the}} spear I had {{was no good}} for me. It was thin and flimsy, only effectual for a thrust, and too long for a quick recover. So I only chased the <b>Selenites</b> {{as far as the}} first carcass, and stopped there and {{picked up one of the}} {{crowbars}} that were lying about. It felt comfortingly heavy, and equal to smashing any number of <b>Selenites.</b> I threw away my spear, and picked up a second crowbar for the other hand. I felt five times better than I had with the spear. I shook the two threateningly at the <b>Selenites,</b> who had come to a halt in a little crowd far away up the cavern, and then turned about to look at Cavor.|$|R
500|$|The astronomers {{run back}} to their capsule while {{continuing}} to hit the pursuing Selenites, and five get inside. The sixth astronomer, Barbenfouillis himself, uses a rope to tip the capsule over a ledge on the Moon and into space. A <b>Selenite</b> tries to seize the capsule at the last minute. Astronomer, capsule, and <b>Selenite</b> fall through space and land in an ocean on Earth, where they are rescued by a ship and towed ashore. The final sequence (missing from some prints of the film) depicts a celebratory parade {{in honor of the}} travelers' return, including a display of the captive <b>Selenite</b> and the unveiling of a commemorative statue bearing the motto [...] "Labor omnia vincit".|$|E
500|$|A Trip to the Moon (...) is a 1902 French silent film {{directed}} by Georges Méliès.
