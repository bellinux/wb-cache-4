500|$|Wichita was a {{railroad}} terminal and {{a destination for}} cattle drives from Texas. Like other frontier railroad terminals, when the cowboys accompanying the cattle drives arrived, the town was filled with drunken, armed cowboys celebrating {{the end of their}} long journey. Lawmen were kept busy. When the cattle drives ended and the cowboys left, Earp searched for <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> A newspaper story in October 1874 reported that he earned some money helping an off-duty police officer find thieves who had stolen a man's wagon. Earp officially joined the Wichita marshal's office on April 21, 1875, after the election of Mike Meagher as city marshal (or police chief), making $100 per month. He also dealt faro at the Long Branch Saloon. In late 1875, the Wichita Beacon newspaper published this story: ...|$|E
500|$|A {{journalist}} wrote, in {{the late}} 1890s, that Leno was [...] "probably the highest paid funny man in the world". In 1898, Leno, Herbert Campbell and Johnny Danvers formed a consortium to build the Granville Theatre in Fulham, which was demolished in 1971. Leno published an autobiography, Dan Leno: Hys Booke, in 1899, ghostwritten by T. C. Elder. Leno's biographer J. Hickory Wood commented: [...] "I can honestly say that I never saw him absolutely at rest. He was always doing something, and had <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> afterwards; or {{he had just been}} somewhere, was going somewhere else, and had several other appointments to follow." [...] That year, Leno performed the role of [...] "waxi omo" [...] (a slang expression for a black-face performer) in the Doo-da-Day Minstrels, an act that included Danvers, Campbell, Bransby Williams, Joe Elvin and Eugene Stratton. [...] The troupe's only performance was at the London Pavilion on 29 May 1899 as part of a benefit. [...] Leno's song [...] "The Funny Little Nigger" [...] greatly amused the audience. His biographer Barry Anthony considered the performance to be [...] "more or less, the last gasp of black-face minstrelsy in Britain".|$|E
2500|$|Before enrolling at Rose Bruford, Oldman had unsuccessfully {{applied to}} the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), which welcomed him to try again the {{following}} year, but advised him to find <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for a living. When asked by Charlie Rose if he had reminded RADA of this, Oldman joked that [...] "the work speaks for itself". He made his professional stage debut in 1979 as Puss, alongside Michael Simkins and Peter Howitt, in Dick Whittington and His Cat, at York's Theatre Royal. The play then ran in Colchester, then with Glasgow's Citizens Theatre; Oldman's work ethic and trademark intensity would make him a favourite with audiences in Glasgow during the 1980s.|$|E

5000|$|Burgess' {{illustration}} of Return to the Hundred Acre Wood in particular received good reviews in The Sunday Times {{as well as}} in Fantasy Book Review and Kidsreads.com. In The Times, Ann Thwaite wrote, [...] "With the new book, Burgess seems indispensable." [...] Jana Siciliano of Kidsreads.com, wrote: [...] "...illustrator Mark Burgess has studied the pen-and-ink-and-watercolor elegance of Ernest H. Shepard's original illustrations and created a beautiful book filled with iconic images rendered in such exacting fashion that one, for a moment, questions {{whether or not they are}} lost Shepard masterpieces (a two-page spread with all the characters playing cricket towards the end is worthy of framing).

60|$|Wandle {{realized}} {{this with a}} shock, {{but he was too}} keen-witted to give way to alarm and leave his task unfinished. He must remove the whole pile, in order to give no cause for suspicion that he had been excavating in search of something; and the sooner it was done the better. It was noon when the work was finished and he entered the house, where there was <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done.</b> He was a methodical man and had a place for each of his belongings. He began by examining the position of every article in a cupboard. None seemed to have been disturbed, which was reassuring, and Wandle proceeded to empty a chest in which he kept his clothing. He had reached the bottom of it when a pair of light summer shoes caught his eye and his face became intent. They were not where he had placed them; he remembered having fitted them in between some other things {{at the opposite end of}} the chest. This confirmed his worst suspicions, but he carefully laid back each garment before he sat down to consider.|$|R
