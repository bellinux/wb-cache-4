30|$|In the K-user {{deterministic}} interference channel, each active level conveys one bit. To avoid collision, {{each level}} at the receiver side should be occupied either by a <b>signal</b> <b>bit</b> or by an interference bit. Actually, this interference bit {{can be a}} modulo- 2 addition of several interference bits, since {{it is not necessary}} to decode each of these interference bits separately. In order to leave as many receive levels as possible “free” for reception of <b>signal</b> <b>bits,</b> it will be advantageous if multiple interference bits fall on one receive level. This is the principle of interference alignment in amplitude space: the alignment of interference saves amplitude levels for desired signals and thus the throughput can be increased.|$|R

40|$|Experimental demonstrations are {{reported}} for end-to-end real-time optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OOFDM) transceivers incorporating three widely adopted adaptive loading techniques, namely, power loading (PL), bit loading (BL), and bit-and-power loading (BPL). In directly modulated distributed-feedback (DFB) laser-based, intensity-modulation, and direct-detection (IMDD) transmission systems consisting {{of up to}} 35 -km single-mode fibers (SMFs), extensive experimental comparisons between these adaptive loading techniques are made in terms of maximum achievable <b>signal</b> <b>bit</b> rate, optical power budget, and digital signal processing (DSP) resource usage. It is shown that BPL is capable of supporting end-to-end real-time OOFDM transmission of 11. 75 Gb/s over 25 -km SMFs in the aforementioned systems at sampling speeds as low as 4 GS/s. In addition, experimental measurements also show that BPL (PL) offers the highest (lowest) <b>signal</b> <b>bit</b> rate, and their optical power budgets are similar. The observed <b>signal</b> <b>bit</b> rate difference between BPL and PL is almost independent of sampling speed and transmission distance. All the aforementioned key features agree very well with numerical simulations. On the other hand, BPL-consumed DSP resources are approximately three times higher than those required by PL. The results indicate that PL is a preferred choice for cost-effective OOFDM transceiver design. © 2011, IEEE. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Being able to {{position}} a data signal {{relative to a}} clock signal with very high resolution and accuracy is an important capability in a BERT. This feature is used on the output of a data generator to ensure the clock signal rising edge corresponds {{to the middle of}} the data <b>signal's</b> <b>bit</b> window, since both signals will use different cabling and routing and can be mis-matched. The capability is also used on the receiver side of a BERT where a separate delay device is used to evaluate BER when the clock signal is not perfectly aligned in the middle of the data <b>signal's</b> <b>bit</b> cell. As the clock signal approaches either side of the data bit cell window, the quantity of errors will rise and the steepness of the rise is based on the amount of jitter between the clock and data signals. This type of analysis is called a Bathtub Curve, which demonstrates a degree of system margin. This is an example of a signal integrity physical-layer test, utilizing BER measurement capability combined with accurate time delay capability.|$|R
