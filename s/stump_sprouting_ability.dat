40|$|Secondary {{forests in}} Japan have been {{abandoned}} and the ecosystem has degraded since the high economic growth period. We carried out cutting in January in three small areas of a long-abandoned secondary forest and investigated the sprout initiation and growth of woody plants for three years in order to reveal the early stage of sprout regeneration and to understand the <b>sprouting</b> <b>ability</b> and characteristics of each species for effective management. The percentage of <b>sprouted</b> <b>stumps</b> {{and the number of}} sprouting shoots was substantially maximized in autumn in the first year. These results suggest that autumn monitoring in the first year after cutting shows the maximum percentage of <b>sprouted</b> <b>stumps</b> and the maximum sprout number when cutting was conducted in the dormant season. With regards to species characteristics, Eurya japonica showed a low percentage of <b>sprouted</b> <b>stumps</b> in the lower plot, where the mean diameter at breast height for this species was smaller than in the other plots. The <b>sprouting</b> <b>ability</b> of E. japonica was deemed to be influenced by parent tree size. Ilex pedunculosa and Lyonia ovalifolia var. elliptica had high percentages of <b>sprouted</b> <b>stumps</b> and many <b>sprouts.</b> These species are useful for obtaining sprouting shoots (e. g., for firewood), {{but it is difficult to}} control their sprouting...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda Raf.) <b>stump</b> <b>sprouts</b> {{were studied}} for 5 {{years in a}} 30 -year-old {{plantation}} thinned to 70 – 75 % stocking (light thinning) and 45 – 50 % stocking (heavy thinning). Sprouting success, survival, number of <b>sprouts</b> per <b>stump,</b> and <b>sprout</b> height differed little between thinning treatments throughout the 5 -year study period. Pre-harvest tree d. b. h. also had no influence on sprout survival and development. A 2 -year drought reduced survival and may have influenced sprout development. Sprout clump survival dropped from 90 % 1 year following thinning to 46 % 3 years after thinning. Although sprout height averaged 337 cm 5 years after thinning, annual sprout growth decreased from 166 cm {{the first year after}} thinning to 33 cm {{in each of the last}} 2 growing seasons.

40|$|Abstract-Stump sprouts are {{considered}} an important regeneration source in hardwood management, especially in upland oak-dominated forests. Less {{is known about}} <b>stump</b> <b>sprouting</b> in bottomland oak forests.

40|$|The {{response}} of forest regeneration to canopy gap formation {{plays a key}} role in forest stand dynamics and future species composition of mesic forests. Results from controlled, replicated experiments, however, are limited. We measured light environment and extension growth for saplings and <b>stump</b> <b>sprouts</b> in and around experimentally harvested canopy gaps two years after formation to evaluate the initial {{response of}} shade tolerant sugar maple (Acer saccharum) versus mid-tolerant bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis) and white ash (Fraxinus americana). Gap areas (projected) ranged from 9 to 443 m≤ and were chosen to represent the typical range found in old-growth forests of the Great Lakes region. No saplings (3 ̆e 0. 5 cm dbh) were browsed by deer, but because of heavy browsing on <b>stump</b> <b>sprouts,</b> analysis of extension growth on sprouts was restricted to a subset of plots fenced to exclude deer. Surprisingly, sugar maple saplings attained higher extension growth rates across all light conditions than the two mid-tolerant species (18. 2 vs. 13. 0 cm, respectively; p = 0. 004). Sugar maple sapling extension growth varied significantly as a function of pre-treatment growth rate and gap area (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Extension growth of mid-tolerant saplings was not significantly correlated with any measured variable. However, <b>stump</b> <b>sprouts</b> grew two to five times faster than saplings (p 3 ̆c 0. 001), and unlike the trend among saplings, mid-tolerants grew faster than sugar maple (100. 1 vs. 67. 8 cm, respectively). Our results indicate that sugar maple saplings respond to canopy gap formation more quickly than midtolerant associates and that <b>stump</b> <b>sprouts</b> outgrew saplings considerably. In addition, the importance of <b>stump</b> <b>sprouting</b> to gap regeneration increased significantly in larger gaps because of harvest damage to saplings. However, saplings have an advantage of greater initial height, so future competitive status may depend on changes in relative growth rates over the next few decades...|$|R

This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the status and growth of asexual and sexual recruits of Q. variabilis in different forest recovery stages. Area of study: Three selective logged stands and one unlogged stand in Q. variabilis forest, Shaanxi Province, China. Material and Methods: Origin, number, basal diameter, height and size structure of Q. variabilis shoots (height ≤ 200 cm) were investigated in the plots of 5, 10, and 20 -years post-logging stands and unlogged stand. Effects of recovery stage on the density and growth of the three original recruits (<b>stump</b> <b>sprouts,</b> stem base sprouts and true seedlings) were analysis by One-way ANOVA. Main results: Sprouts dominated logged stands, whereas true seedlings dominated unlogged stand, stem base sprouts only existed in 20 -years post-logging and unlogged stands. <b>Stump</b> <b>sprout</b> density and <b>sprout</b> number per <b>stump</b> both declined with extended post-logging time. True seedlings density increased from 7 to 20 shoots/ 100 m 2 as the postlogging time extended, and peaked in unlogged stand (94 shoots/ 100 m 2). An ongoing size structure was observed in true seedlings in all stands. <b>Stump</b> <b>sprouts</b> were taller and greater than true seedlings. Research highlights: <b>Stump</b> <b>sprouts</b> contributed more to Q. variabilis forest recovery in the early stage after disturbance. The contribution of true seedlings was limited in the same stage, but they were beneficial for population long-term development.

40|$|Plants in the sandhill {{habitats}} of {{the southeast}} {{are thought to be}} limited by soil resources such as water and nutrients. We measured ecophysiological characters related to resource use for several growth stages: Seedling Sprouts (small sprouts from small root collars), <b>Stump</b> <b>Sprouts</b> (small sprouts from large root collars) and Adults (large reproductively mature trees) of Quercus laevis (turkey oak) in SC. Adults did not differ from <b>Stump</b> <b>Sprouts</b> in water potentials, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, or leaf nitrogen. In contrast, Seedling <b>Sprouts</b> differed from <b>Stump</b> <b>Sprouts</b> and Adults in June: lower predawn water potentials, lower rates of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, higher specific leaf area, and lower leaf N concentration. The September growth stages rankings for these characters were generally similar to those in June, but variation within a growth stage was greater and thus Seedling Sprouts were only significantly different from the other two growth stages for leaf nitrogen. The differences between Seedling Sprouts and larger individuals may be due to differential access to soil resources as a function of rooting depth. Soil water availability was high in March, low in June, and higher again in September except at 1. 25 m. Soil total N was higher at soil depth of 0 - 0. 1 than 0. 1 - 0. 2 m in March, but did not differ between 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75, 1. 00 and 1. 25 m in June.

40|$|Application. A partial {{overstory}} did {{not influence}} {{the number of}} <b>stumps</b> that <b>sprouted</b> {{or the number of}} sprouts per clump. Sprout clump survival and growth of dominant sprouts can be maximized under heavy partial cuttings. Additional overstory removal or sprout clump thinning may be necessary to maintain vigor of <b>stump</b> <b>sprouts</b> beneath partial overstories. Abstract. A 28 -year-old water oak (Quercus nigra L.) plantation was thinned from below to either 254 or 462 stems per hectare to determine the influence of a partial canopy on oak <b>stump</b> <b>sprout</b> development. Sprout clump survival, number of living sprouts in a clump, and height and DBH of the dominant sprout in a clump were measured in years l- 5 and 7 after harvest. By year 7, sprout clump survival under the heavily thinned canopy was 23 % higher than under the lightly thinned canopy. Within-clump sprout mortality was not influenced by overstory thinning level, but by year 2 height and diameter increment were 15 % and 22 % greater, respectively, under the heavy overstory removal. Positive height and diameter growth of dominant sprouts continued under both canopy conditions through year 7, but early benefits of the heavy overstory removal on sprout growth diminished. Additional overstory removal or sprout clump thinning would be necessary to sustain sprout clump survival and sprout growth over extended periods...|$|R

40|$|Populus {{species are}} among the most {{productive}} tree species in Sweden. Interest in growing them has increased during the 21 st century due to political goals to increase the share of renewable energy and to increase the proportion of hardwood species in forests. Populus species {{have been shown to be}} potentially profitable, but currently they are mostly planted on abandoned agricultural land. There is a lack of knowledge about the establishment of Populus species on forest sites. There is also a lack of knowledge of how second generations can be established by root and <b>stump</b> <b>sprouts,</b> and about management of young stands. The main objective of this thesis was to focus on these issues. Site properties are important for successful establishment of Populus species and factors such as soil pH and soil moisture should be considered. Site preparation is important to control weed competition and to modify the microclimate, including soil moisture. In this thesis, mounding in relation to patch scarification, soil inversion and no intervention, were found to provide the highest survival and growth. Hybrid aspen was in most cases found to be more robust than other Populus species, but poplar plants or long unrooted cuttings showed similar survival and faster growth at the site where soil pH was high. In general, short unrooted poplar cuttings showed high mortality on forest sites. In water saturated soils, the growth of poplar cuttings was inhibited and roots were located closer to the soil surface. This was mainly caused by the absence of callus roots originating at the base of the cutting. Poplar <b>stump</b> <b>sprouts</b> can be used successfully for regeneration if the clones can produce living straight sprouts. Variability in this trait was found in one of the studies in this thesis. A second generation of naturally-regenerated hybrid aspen can produce over 100, 000 root suckers per hectare. If no early management is conducted, biomass will be lost through self-thinning. It was shown in this study that a substantial amount of biomass can be harvested schematically through corridors or cross-corridors, resulting in stimulated stem diameter development. An additional early thinning further increased the diameter on crop trees. In this thesis, site-adapted management of Populus species is suggested to be the most important measure to achieve successful regeneration. In particular, this includes choosing species and clones adapted to specific site properties. A second generation can be established either by <b>stump</b> <b>sprouts</b> (poplars) or root suckers (hybrid aspen). If larger-dimensioned trees are desired, early thinnings are important in the second generation...|$|R
