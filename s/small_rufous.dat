60|$|Billy {{conceived}} {{a suspicion}} that these innocent inquiries {{were designed to}} emphasize a contrast in his social quality. But {{he could not be}} sure. One never could be sure with Lady Marayne. It might be just that she did not understand the sort of man he was. And in that case ought he to maintain the smooth social surface unbroken by pretending as far as possible to be this kind of person, or ought he to make a sudden gap in it by telling his realities. He evaded the shooting question anyhow. He left it open for Lady Marayne and the venerable butler and Sir Godfrey and every one to suppose he just happened to be the sort of gentleman of leisure who doesn't shoot. He disavowed hunting, he made it appear he travelled when he travelled in directions other than Scotland. But the fourth question brought him to bay. He regarded his questioner with his <b>small</b> <b>rufous</b> eye.|$|E

40|$|Longitudinal {{sampling}} for {{intestinal microbiota}} in wild animals is difficult, {{leading to a}} lack of information on bacterial dynamics occurring in nature. We studied how the composition of microbiota communities changed temporally in free-ranging <b>small</b> primates, <b>rufous</b> mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus). We marked and recaptured mouse lemurs during their mating season in Ranomafana National Park in southeastern mountainous rainforests of Madagascar for 2 years and determined the fecal microbiota compositions of these mouse lemurs with MiSeq sequencing. We collected 160 fecal samples from 71 animals and had two or more samples from 39 individuals. We found small, but statistically significant, effects of site and age on microbiota richness and diversity and effects of sex, year, and site on microbiota composition, while the within-year temporal trends were less clear. Within-host microbiota showed pervasive variation in intestinal bacterial community composition, especially during the second study year. We hypothesize that the biological properties of mouse lemurs, including their small body size and fast metabolism, may contribute to the temporal intraindividual-level variation, something that should be testable with more-extensive sampling regimes...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} races {{which are now}} often split into a varying number of {{separate}} species. Z. aurea (White's thrush), including the questionable subspecies Z. a. toratugumi, is the migratory Siberian and north-east Asian form. Z. neilgherriensis (Nilgiri thrush) is resident {{in the hills of}} southwest India. Z. imbricata (Sri Lanka thrush) is endemic to the hills of Sri Lanka and is particularly distinctive, being <b>smaller,</b> long-billed and <b>rufous</b> below. Z. dauma (scaly thrush) breeds in the Himalaya and migrates to the foothills in winter. Z. d. horsfieldi (Horsfield's thrush) is resident in Indonesia on the islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Lombok and Sumbawa. Z. d. major (Amami thrush) is restricted to the Amami Islands in Japan.|$|R
50|$|All {{adult males}} are slate-grey; the grey throat extends well down the bird's breast {{with a sharp}} {{demarcation}} to the barred underparts. The iris, orbital ring, {{the base of the}} bill and feet are yellow. Grey adult females have a pinkish-buff or buff background to the barring and neck sides, and sometimes <b>small</b> <b>rufous</b> spots on the median and greater coverts and the outer webs of the secondary feathers.|$|E
50|$|The Cape batis is strikingly patterned. The {{adult male}} has a grey crown, black eye mask and white throat. Its back is brown, {{with a black}} rump and tail and rufous wings. The underparts are white with a broad black breast band and rufous flanks. The female and {{juvenile}} plumages differ in that the breast band is narrower and rufous, not black, {{and there is a}} <b>small</b> <b>rufous</b> patch on the throat. Their rufous wings and flanks distinguish them from other Batis species in the region.|$|E
50|$|Timpoong and Hibok-Hibok {{comprises}} about 300 ha of mossy forests at elevations above 1,100 m, 1,282 ha {{of residual}} lowland dipterocarp forests at elevations above 500 m, and brush lands and open grasslands covering the remaining 1,585 ha. The natural monument was {{established for the}} conservation of endangered and endemic fauna that live within those forests. They include one bird species and two mammals that can only be found in Camiguin: the Camiguin hanging parrot, and the Camiguin forest mouse and Camiguin forest rat. Other fauna include the Camiguin hawk-owl, writhed hornbill, Mindanao shrew, Camiguin narrow-mouthed frog, big-eyed frog and <b>small</b> <b>rufous</b> horseshoe bat.|$|E
50|$|The {{powerful}} owl breeds in the Australian winter, with breeding occurring {{mainly in}} May and June and brooding at the nest into September. The breeding behaviour of powerful and rufous owls {{appears to be}} highly similar. The breeding territory of powerful owls are large. Even when food is abundant, territories are at least 800 to 1000 ha. When food is scarce, territories tend to be larger. On average, nests of breeding pairs are found from 5 to 20 km apart. The nest is most often a large hollow in a tree. Nests have been recorded at 8 to 30 m above the ground but are most often at least 10 to 15 m high. The nesting material includes decaying debris and leaf litter. Eggs are oval and dull white. The clutch is most often two, but occasionally includes only one egg and rarely three are laid. The egg averages about 55 x 46 mm. The eggs are typically laid directly on the rotten wooden floor of the nesting cavity, owls do not build a nest. Egg-laying intervals are up to 4 days {{between the first and}} second egg, an unusually long interval for an owl. The females appears to do all incubation and the incubating stage is around 38 days. The male does all hunting and sometimes aggressively defends the nesting incubation. In other owls that show aggression towards humans during nesting, it usually the female who is the main aggressor, although in other owls the females are larger with stronger strikes, whereas in the powerful owl, the males are the larger and more powerful sex. Occasionally, females may abandon their nest if disturbed. In general, the slightly <b>smaller</b> <b>rufous</b> and notably <b>smaller</b> barking owl both display more frequent and more spiritedly aggressive nest defense than the powerful owl does. Young powerful owls are mostly off-white with a greyish-brown mask and grey on the wings and coverts, obviously distinct from the adult plumage. The young fledge at 6 to 8 weeks. However, the young typically accompany and are fed by their parents for several months even into the stage that they can fly well, the total dependence period usually lasting 5 to 9 months before independence, and sometimes into the next breeding season. Although there are practically no predators of this species except wedge-tailed eagles, powerful owls have been recorded killing each other in territorial and breeding skirmishes. Also, they are often victim to and occasionally even injured by heavy mobbing by larger passerines such as currawongs, magpies, and crows and ravens. In one case, a pair of Australian ravens (Corvus coronoides) attacked and killed a powerful owl, likely to defend themselves and their nest.|$|R
50|$|It is 15 to 18 cm {{in length}} with the long, pointed tail {{feathers}} accounting {{for much of}} this. The bill is short and pointed and the wings are short and rounded. The plumage varies among the four subspecies. The nominate subspecies L. a. aegithaloides of central Chile is mainly brown with paler underparts, rufous markings on the wings and crown and a white stripe above the eye. The head and upper breast are streaked while the back is plain. L. a. berlepschi occurs high in the Andes {{in the northern part}} of the species' range and is larger and more buff-coloured than the other forms. L. a. grisescens is found in the arid lowlands of north Chile and south Peru. It is rather greyish in colour with little streaking on the breast. In most of Argentina and south Chile, L. a. pallida occurs. It is pale and greyish with only a <b>small</b> area of <b>rufous</b> in the wing.|$|R
50|$|Megapodes are {{so named}} for their large feet and like {{others in the}} group, this species is fowl like with dark brown plumage, a short tail and large feet and claws. The tarsus is bare with the hind toe {{situated}} {{on the same level}} as the front toes unlike those of other Galliform birds, enabling them to grasp objects better than other game birds. The tarsus has broad flat strip like scales on the front. The tail is short with twelve feathers. The head is more grey with a rufous crest and bare reddish facial skin. The males and females are very similar but the male is dark brown overall while the female has more grey on the underparts. Young birds have a fully feathered face and hatchlings are <b>small</b> quail-like with <b>rufous</b> barring on the wings and back. The nominate subspecies is paler than abbotti from the islands south of the Sombrero Channel.|$|R
50|$|The olive-backed {{euphonia}} (Euphonia gouldi) {{is a small}} passerine bird in the finch family. It is {{a resident}} breeder in the Caribbean lowlands and foothills from southern Mexico to western Panama. The olive-backed euphonia is found in wet forests, tall second growth and adjacent bushy clearings, typically from sea level to 750 m altitude, sometimes up to 1000 m. The spherical cup nest, with a side entrance, is hidden amongst epiphytes or mosses 2-11 m high in a tree. The normal clutch is three brown-marked white eggs.The adult olive-backed euphonia is 9.5 cm long and weighs 12 g. The adult male has glossy olive upperparts, a yellow forehead, and a rufous belly surrounded by yellow. The adult female has less glossy upperparts than the male, a chestnut forehead, yellow underparts and a <b>small</b> <b>rufous</b> belly patch. Immatures are darker, duller, and have olive underparts.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 12 mm. The forewings are silvery white, the costa tinged with orange-yellow towards the base. There is a <b>small</b> tuft of <b>rufous</b> scales below {{the middle of}} the costa with the orange yellow antemedial and medial lines arising below it and rather diverging towards the inner margin. There is also a conical postmedial patch defined by orange-yellow from the costa to vein 5, with a brown point on the line defining its outer side at the costa. There is also an orange-yellow subterminal line, excurved to the submedian fold, where it is angled inwards and a fine yellow-brown line beyond it, incurved below vein 2, the terminal area tinged with yellow. The hindwings are silvery white with a small orange-yellow discoidal spot and an orange-yellow postmedial line, excurved to vein 4, then bent inwards to the origin of vein 2 and oblique to the inner margin. There is also an orange-yellow subterminal line, excurved to vein 2, then incurved, with a fine yellow-brown line beyond it. The terminal area is tinged with yellow.|$|R
40|$|On 28 October 1987 my uncle, Lee Johnson,and J {{saw a small}} dove on {{the bird}} bath at my home in Kearney. We did not use {{binoculars}}, {{and thought it was}} a small Mourning Dove. On 2 November my son Gary Paine. and I saw it and used binoculars on it, noting its <b>small</b> size and <b>rufous</b> wings. We thought it was a Common Ground-Dove. and reported it to Dr. C. W. Bliese. On 2 December it was seen again on the bird bath and in trees. This time Margaret Triplett identified it as an Inca Dove, and the identification was confirmed then and later by other observers, who came from all over the state to see it. The identification was based on the small body, about sparrow-sized, scaly back, rufous on wings which showed only in flight or when the wings were moved. The eyes showed red at times. The beak was long, slender, and dark. It had black and white on a long, pointed tail. Noreen Schutz. who lives about a mile from us, saw a bird feeding and drinking in her yard 12 and 13 December which she thought was the Inca Dove, but there have been no other indications of where it may have spent its time between appearances here. It was last seen at my home on 3 March, but it was seen 7 March a block away at the Warren Miller 2 ̆ 7 s...|$|R
