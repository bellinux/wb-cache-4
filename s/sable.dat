During their angle, the evil <b>Sable</b> followed Wilson down to her matches, talked with her backstage, and on one occasion, she left Wilson in a tag match alone to fend for herself. <b>Sable</b> eventually challenged Wilson to a showdown bikini contest at Judgment Day. After <b>Sable</b> got the bigger applause, Wilson removed her chaddi to reveal an even smaller bikini underneath, and Special Guest Referee Tazz declared Wilson the winner. After the match, Wilson went up to <b>Sable</b> and kissed her before exiting the ring. <b>Sable</b> then had an altercation with the guest judge Tazz, dumping water on him on the following edition of SmackDown!, as a means of gaining revenge for declaring Wilson the winner.|$|E

5|$|The Divas rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between <b>Sable</b> and Torrie Wilson. <b>Sable</b> and Torrie teamed {{together}} at WrestleMania XX and defeated Raw Divas Miss Jackie and Stacy Keibler, but when Torrie was featured {{on the cover of}} SmackDown!

5|$|In 1960, the Canadian {{government}} {{protected the}} horses by law in their feral state. From the 1980s on, long-term, noninvasive herd {{studies have been}} performed, and in 2007 a genetic analysis was conducted that concluded the herd was genetically unique enough to interest conservationists.

The herd is unmanaged, and legally protected from interference by humans.

5|$|The <b>Sable</b> Island horse, {{sometimes}} referred to as the <b>Sable</b> Island pony, is a type of small feral horse found on <b>Sable</b> Island, an island off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a small type, often pony sized, but with a horse phenotype and horse ancestors, and usually dark in color. The first horses were released on the island in the late eighteenth century, and soon became feral. Additional horses were later transported to improve the herd's breeding stock. They were rounded up for private use and sale for slaughter, which by the 1950s had placed them in danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{has four}} main colors: black and tan, blue and tan, brown and tan, solid red of various shades. Red {{includes}} <b>sable</b> (red where {{the tips of the}} hairs are black, known as overlay) and red <b>sable</b> (red with brown overlay).|$|E

5|$|<b>Sable</b> briefly {{became a}} face again when she {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} Playboy magazine (March 2004 issue) {{for the third time in}} her career. On the cover, she appeared with fellow diva Torrie Wilson, making them the first WWE Divas to pose in Playboy together. Surrounding the release of the cover, the duo feuded with Raw divas Stacy Keibler and Miss Jackie, even though all four women were faces at the time. The two teams squared off at WrestleMania XX in an Interpromotional Tag Team Evening Gown match, but the divas started the match in their underwear, making it more of a lingerie match. <b>Sable</b> and Wilson were victorious. The change was rumored to have occurred because <b>Sable</b> had suffered damage to her Breast Implants while Weightlifting.|$|E

5|$|Two {{species of}} birds in the park {{are in danger of}} disappearing. The range of the Cape <b>Sable</b> seaside sparrow is {{restricted}} to Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress Swamp. In 1981 6,656 Cape <b>Sable</b> seaside sparrows were reported in park boundaries, but surveys over 10 years documented a decline to an estimated 2,624 birds by 2002. Attempts to return natural levels of water to the park have been controversial; Cape <b>Sable</b> seaside sparrows nest about a foot off the ground, and rising water levels may harm future populations, as well as threaten the endangered snail kite. The Everglades snail kite eats apple snails almost exclusively, and the Everglades is the only location in the United States where this bird of prey exists. There is some evidence that the population may be increasing, but loss of habitat and food sources keep the estimated number of these birds at several hundred.|$|E
