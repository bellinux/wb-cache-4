A PVC structured wall pipe {{can be produced}} by <b>spirally</b> <b>winding</b> a ribbed sheet having a male-female lock, chemically welded by an adhesive. These pipes are "flexible" and are used mainly in underground installations, to convey fluids in free duct regime. Initial {{studies have indicated that}} the buckling resistance of the ribs from the sheet coiling to the tube manufacturing is the critical design parameter. This study presents the theoretical analytical development in order to obtain the critical buckling moment of these sheets. This analysis uses concepts initially developed to calculate buckling resistance in monosymmetrical profiles that are very used in the metallic structure industry. Since the material used was PVC, that has different mechanical properties than steel and aluminum, it was necessary to consider the differences in the analytical treatment. It is important to emphasize that the results obtained are product of the co-operative work of engineers from industry and university...|$|E

60|$|As {{with a few}} {{exceptions}} tendrils spontaneously revolve, it may be asked,--why have they been endowed with sensitiveness?--why, when they come into contact with a stick, do they not, like twining plants, <b>spirally</b> <b>wind</b> round it? One reason may be that they are in most cases so flexible and thin, that when brought into contact with any object, they would almost certainly yield and be dragged onwards by the revolving movement. Moreover, the sensitive extremities have no revolving power as far as I have observed, and could not by this means curl round a support. With twining plants, on the other hand, the extremity spontaneously bends more than any other part; and this is of high importance for the ascent of the plant, as may be seen on a windy day. It is, however, possible that the slow movement of the basal and stiffer parts of certain tendrils, which wind round sticks placed in their path, may be analogous to that of twining plants. But I hardly attended sufficiently to this point, {{and it would have been}} difficult to distinguish between a movement due to extremely dull irritability, from the arrestment of the lower part, whilst the upper part continued to move onwards.|$|R
40|$|The aim {{with this}} master`s thesis {{project was to}} examine what effect {{structured}} heating surfaces have on the mass and heat transfer properties of falling film evaporation. Based on a literature study, some alternative surface structures that could be of interest for falling film evaporation of black liquor were selected for further investigation. A new structure was also selected to be tested. Tubes of copper and PVC were utilized {{as a basis for}} the experimental investigation. Five different copper test tubes were studied: one smooth, two equipped with dimples located in a row or diagonal towards each other, one spirally threaded and one <b>spirally</b> <b>winded</b> with a copper thread. Two test tubes of PVC were studied: one smooth and one equipped with the new structure. The tests were carried out by attaching the different test tubes one by one to the lower edge of a vertically placed falling film tube. Ordinary tap water was utilized as the testing fluid. A divider placed {{at the top of the}} falling film tube allowed an evenly distributed film to be formed that flowed therafter down over the falling film tube wall and the test tube. Since the test tubes were not provided with a heating element, the mass transport was measured from the test tubes to the falling film. This result was then used to estimate the heat transfer through calculations. As mass transport medium benzoic acid was chosen which was applied on the test tubes dissolved in a small amount of acetone. The mixture of dissolved benzoic aid in acetone was sprayed with a spurt bottle on the test tube surface, where the acetone was evaporated and left behind a relatively even layer of benzoic acid. For each test run, four samples of the falling film were taken out at fixed time points after that the falling film had passed over the benzoic acid covered test tube. The mass concentration of benzoic acid was then determined with the help of spectrophotometry. The different test tubes mass flux were determined from the measured mass concentrations and utilized film flow after that the benzoic acid covered surfaces had been calculated for each trial run. These mass fluxes were then divided by the solubility of benzoic acid in water to estimate the mass transport coefficients which were in turn used to estimate the heat transport coefficients (heat transition number) based on the Chilton-Colburn analogy. The results indicate that all the tested surface modifications should be able to enhance the mass and heat transport in a falling film of water comperad to a smooth surface. The new structure and the spirally threaded structure achived the highest enhancements (113 and 114 %) of the estimated heat transport coefficients compared to the reference smooth tube structure. The heat transport coefficient enhancements for the other structures tested were 69 % (structure with dimples located diagonally towards each other), 65 % (structure with a <b>spirally</b> <b>winded</b> copper thread), and 44 % for the structure with dimples located in a row towards each other...|$|R
40|$|Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is an MRI {{technique}} that measures {{the diffusion of}} water in tissue such as white matter and muscle. From a DTI dataset, tracts representing fibers in the data can be reconstructed. Because of the vast amounts of fibers that can be reconstructed from a dataset, the visualization of these fibers is a challenging problem. In order to give the user {{a better understanding of}} the structure of the data, it is necessary to convey both the shapes of fibers, and the mutual coherency among multiple fibers and groups of fibers. Besides the fibers that were reconstructed, the local tensor properties, such as the second and third eigendirections and eigenvalues, are also of importance. We propose to use line illumination and shadowing of fibers in order to improve the perception of their structure. We also present a new method, inspired by the modeling of curled hair, for showing extra tensor properties along the fibers. This is done by showing curves that <b>spirally</b> <b>wind</b> around the actual fiber location, where the local tensor determines the parameters of that curve. We implemented the illumination, shadowing, and spiral curves, in such a way that the user can interact with the data and interactively change all parameters. The presented methods help in gaining more insight in DTI data of the brain and the heart. It is now possible to visualize more dense fiber structures using lighting and shadowing. The spiral curves help in evaluating the data where the extra tensor properties are of importance. ...|$|R

This talisman was a conch shell cut at the {{cross-section}} and was likely worn as a necklace by religious rulers, {{as they have been}} discovered in burials in archaeological sites throughout Mesoamerica, and potentially symbolized patterns witnessed in hurricanes, dust devils, seashells, and whirlpools, which were elemental forces that had significance in Aztec mythology. In codex drawings, Quetzalcoatl and Xolotl were both pictured as wearing an ehecailacocozcatl around each of their necks. There has additionally been at least one major cache of offerings with knives and idols adorned with the symbols of more than one god, some of which were adorned with wind jewels.|$|R
5000|$|The rather thin, smooth {{shell is}} ovate and conical. Its ground color is whitish, with spots {{of a more}} or less dark red, and upon the lower whorl, a very large spot of the same tint, but deeper. Upon the {{convexity}} of this whorl, may be counted nine or ten distant, parallel and transverse lines of a bright chestnut color, sometimes brown, at other times blackish. The spire is composed of eight whorls, the three lower of which are smooth, and the other five marked with small longitudinal folds, slightly arcuated. The ovate aperture is widened towards the base, which is deeply emarginated, terminated above by a small dilated canal, which is formed by a re-entering angle from the outer lip, and a transverse tooth from the left lip. The outer lip is arcuated towards the top, thinner from the middle to the base, and armed in this part with five conical, pointed teeth, the lowest of which are longest. It is ornamented in the interior with a great number of small, very fine transverse striae. The left lip forms a plate which laps over upon the body of the shell, and gives rise to a small projecting keel, which is terminated below by a pointed and oblique tooth, from whence a rounded fold is given out, which is observed to <b>wind</b> <b>spirally</b> into the cavity.|$|R
6000|$|Genlisea ornata (Brazil).--This {{species has}} been {{described}} and figured by Dr. Warming,* who states that it bears two kinds of leaves, called by him spathulate and utriculiferous. The latter include cavities; and as these differ much from the bladders of the foregoing species, it will be convenient to speak of them as utricles. The accompanying figure (fig. 29) {{of one of the}} utriculiferous leaves, about thrice enlarged, will illustrate the following description by my son, which agrees in all essential points with that given by Dr. Warming. The utricle (b) is formed by a slight enlargement of the narrow blade of the leaf. A hollow neck (n), no less than fifteen times as long as the utricle itself, forms a passage from the transverse slit-like orifice (o) into the cavity of the utricle. A utricle which measured 1/36 of an inch (.705 mm.,) in its longer diameter had a neck 15/36 (10.583 mm.) in length, and 1/100 of an inch (.254 mm.) in breadth. On each side of the orifice there is a long spiral arm or tube (a); the structure of which will be best understood by the following illustration. Take a narrow ribbon and <b>wind</b> it <b>spirally</b> round a thin cylinder, so that the edges come into contact along its whole length; then pinch up the two edges so as to form a little crest, which will of course <b>wind</b> <b>spirally</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{performed}} on minute {{structures of the}} cerebellum in the albino rat by a modification of Bielschowsky 2 ̆ 7 s silver stain method have revealed the following findings: (1) All the fine branches of the Purkinje dendrite that run horizontally end free in the molecular layer. Each one of these fibrils terminates in an oese which the author has termed 2 ̆ 2 osen Korperchen. 2 ̆ 2 Among the fibrils that have oese-shaped terminations are the fibrils given off from the Purkinje dendrite {{and the process of}} the basket cell, and the climbing fibers and horizontal fibers that run in the molecular layer. The fibrils given off from the dendrite, which climb perpendicularly in the molecular layer, reach the surface of the cerebellar cortex, with the ultimate branches ramifying {{in the form of an}} umbrella, and ending in the innermost membrane which covers the surface of the cortex. The axon of a Purkinje cell has only two or three short collaterals that end free in the granular layer. (2) The descending branches given off from a basket cell concern in the formation of a basket-like nest, the upper Part of which is formed of fibers originating in the axon of the basket cell, and the lower part of which is made up of fibers originating in the medulla. The delicate twigs given off from the fibers forming a basket-like nest have terminations in the form of oese, and connect with the Purkinje cell. (3) climbing fibers originating in the medulla climb upward, <b>winding</b> <b>spirally</b> about the Purkinje dendrites and their branches. There are other fibers which climb parallel to the dendrites and their branches. They could also be classified as climbing fibers. (4) Countless horizontal nerve fibers that run horizontally in the tholecular layer have been found to be the horizontal branches given off either from the nerve fibers that climb perpendicularly in the molecular layer or from the axons of basket cells. The perpendicular nerve fibers climb perpendicularly in the molecular layer, and reach the surface of the cortex. (5) The Fananas nouroglia cell occurs in the molecular. layer. It has a process which, being given off from the upperpole alone, climbs perpendicularly in the molecular layer, and resembles oligodendroglia in form and structure. Large than Hortegaglia, the Fananas cell would be of a special type of oligodendroglia. (6) New types of neuroglia cells have been identified in the molecular layer: the cell of type 1 which, resembling as it does the Fananas, cell, has a process which, being given off only from the lower pole, descends in the molecular layer; and the cell of type 2 is a small round cell which always surrounds the Purkinje cell in the molecular and granular layers, and which has radial processes, the end of which connect with the fibrils of the basket cell, The neuroglia cells of this type form satellites around the Purkinje cells. (7) There are epitherial neuroglia cells of Golgi, which are located between the Purkinje cells. They have linear or Y-shaped processes which climb perpendicularly in the molecular layer, and reach the surface of the cortex. Having collaterals, the process connects with the Purkinje dendrites, as well as with the processes of adjoining nerve cells of the same variety. (8) Granular cells are of two forms: the one consists of a small nucleus and a large amount of cytoplasm, while the other has a large nucleus and a small amount of cytoplasm. Between these granular cells, there are the lymphatic lumen, the accumulated colloidal granules, the dendrites of granular cells and the oeseshaped terminations of moss fibers. These elements are connected with one another. It would seem that the granular cell is a form of nerve cells producing secretions, and that the colloidal granule is its product which is to be absorbed into the lymphatic lumen. (9) The Golgi cells located directly beneath the Purkinje cells are bipolar cells which resemble the Purkinje cells, but those located elsewhere are all multipolar cells. (10) The three types of neuroglia cells-macroglia, oligodendroglia and Hortegaglia-occur in every layer of the cerebellum. It has been found that there are two varieties of macroglia, big and little, and that the latter includes those that are transitional in form from oligodendroglia. Macroglia forms glial little foot in the capillary wall. Direct cell division takes place in macroglia and oligodendrolia. It would seem that Hortegaglia, forming glial little foot in the capillary wall, is as ectodermal in origin as macroglia is...|$|R
