There were other {{troubles}} thought to be a result of too small an ashpan causing choking of the grate. However, the chief problem was the failure of the unusual derived motion design. The valve gear was insufficiently robust and the valve <b>spindle</b> <b>guides</b> (originally cast iron) had to be replaced in cast steel, but this did not address the fundamental shortcomings of the design and the performance of these large locomotives remained woeful.|$|R
40|$|Mitosis is a {{fundamental}} process {{in the development of}} all organisms. The mitotic <b>spindle</b> <b>guides</b> the cell through mitosis as it mediates the segregation of chromosomes, the orientation of the cleavage furrow, and the progression of cell division. Birth defects and tissue-specific cancers often result from abnormalities in mitotic events. Here, we report a proteomic study of the mitotic spindle from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Four different isolations of metaphase spindles were subjected to Multi-dimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) analysis and tandem mass spectrometry. We identified 1155 proteins and used Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to categorize proteins into cellular component groups. We then compared our data to the previously published CHO midbody proteome and identified proteins that are unique to the CHO spindle. Our data represent the first mitotic spindle proteome in CHO cells, which augments the list of mitotic spindle components from mammalian cells...|$|R

30|$|It {{has been}} shown that the mitotic spindle is a ‘self-made machine’, i.e., it can self-organize under biologically poor {{conditions}} (in the absence of centrosome and chromatin) [20]–[22]. To explain these findings it has been proposed that the physical state of the cytoplasm surrounding chromosomes is changed in a way that favors microtubule growth and self-organization into the spindle [21]. Indeed, it has recently been shown that self-organization of anastral <b>spindles</b> are <b>guided</b> by the synergy of dynamic instability, autocatalytic microtubule production and spatial signaling gradients [19]. Taken together these works may support the idea that some synergy operating mode(s) may be inherent to microtubule systems and local solution conditions.|$|R

40|$|The co-chaperone BAG 3, {{in complex}} {{with the heat}} shock protein HSPB 8, {{plays a role in}} protein quality control during {{mechanical}} strain. It is part of a multichaperone complex that senses damaged cytoskeletal proteins and orchestrates their seclusion and/or degradation by selective autophagy. Here we describe a novel role for the BAG 3 -HSPB 8 complex in mitosis, a process involving profound changes in cell tension homeostasis. BAG 3 is hyperphosphorylated at mitotic entry and localizes to centrosomal regions. BAG 3 regulates, in an HSPB 8 -dependent manner, the timely congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate by influencing the three-dimensional positioning of the mitotic spindle. Depletion of BAG 3 caused defects in cell rounding at metaphase and dramatic blebbing of the cortex associated with abnormal spindle rotations. Similar defects were observed upon silencing of the autophagic receptor p 62 /SQSTM 1 that contributes to BAG 3 -mediated selective autophagy pathway. Mitotic cells depleted of BAG 3, HSPB 8 or p 62 /SQSTM 1 exhibited disorganized actin-rich retraction fibres, which are proposed to <b>guide</b> <b>spindle</b> orientation. Proper spindle positioning was rescued in BAG 3 -depleted cells upon addition of the lectin concanavalin A, which restores cortex rigidity. Together, our findings suggest the existence of a so-far unrecognized quality control mechanism involving BAG 3, HSPB 8 and p 62 /SQSTM 1 for accurate remodelling of actin-based mitotic structures that <b>guide</b> <b>spindle</b> orientation...|$|R
50|$|A {{ring frame}} was {{constructed}} from cast iron, and later pressed steel. On {{each side of}} the frame are the spindles, above them are draughting (drafting) rollers and on top is a creel loaded with bobbins of roving. The roving (unspun thread) passes downwards from the bobbins to the draughting rollers. Here the back roller steadied the incoming thread, while the front rollers rotated faster, pulling the roving out and making the fibres more parallel. The rollers are individually adjustable, originally by mean of levers and weights. The attenuated roving now passes through a thread guide that is adjusted to be centred above the <b>spindle.</b> Thread <b>guides</b> are on a thread rail which allows them to be hinged out of the way for doffing or piecing a broken thread. The attenuated roving passes down to the spindle assembly, where it is threaded though a small D ring called the traveller. The traveller moves along the ring. It is this that gives the ring frame its name. From here the thread is attached to the existing thread on the spindle.|$|R
5000|$|Doffing is a {{separate}} process. An attendant (or robot in an automated system) winds down the ring rails to the bottom. The machine stops. The thread guides are hinged up. The completed bobbin coils (yarn packages) are removed from the spindles. The new bobbin tube {{is placed on the}} spindle trapping the thread between it and the cup in the wharf of the <b>spindle,</b> the thread <b>guides</b> are lowered and the machine restarted. Now all the processes are done automatically. The yarn is taken to a cone winder. Currently, machines are manufactured by Rieter (Switzerland), ToyoTa (Japan), Zinser, Suessen, (Germany) and Marzoli (Italy). The Rieter compact K45 system, has 1632 spindles, while the ToyoTa has a machine with 1824 spindles. All require controlled atmospheric conditions.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanisms}} by which the mammalian mitotic <b>spindle</b> is <b>guided</b> to a predefined orientation through microtubule-cortex interactions have recently received considerable interest, {{but there has been}} no dynamic model that describes spindle movements toward the preferred axis in human cells. Here, we develop a dynamic model based on stochastic activity of cues anisotropically positioned around the cortex of the mitotic cell and we show that the mitotic spindle does not reach equilibrium before chromosome segregation. Our model successfully captures the characteristic experimental behavior of noisy spindle rotation dynamics in human epithelial cells, including a weak underlying bias in the direction of rotation, suppression of motion close to the alignment axis, and the effect of the aspect ratio of the interphase cell shape in defining the final alignment axis. We predict that the force exerted per cue has a value that minimizes the deviation of the spindle from the predefined axis. The model has allowed us to systematically explore the parameter space around experimentally relevant configurations, and predict the mechanistic function of a number of established regulators of spindle orientation, highlighting how physical modeling of a noisy system can lead to functional biological understanding. We provide key insights into measurable parameters in live cells that can help distinguish between mechanisms of microtubule and cortical-cue interactions that jointly control the final orientation of the spindle...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the re-contouring {{process of}} {{aircraft}} engine components, the unknown geometry and inhomogeneous material {{properties of the}} workpiece are major challenges. For this reason a new repair process chain is supposed which consists of noncontact geometry identification, process simulation and NC-path planning, followed by a force controlled milling process. A new milling machine prototype is employed to ensure an effective force control loop. By use of a magnetic <b>guided</b> <b>spindle</b> slide, higher dynamics and precise tracking are enabled. Since variation of the process forces result in variable control plant characteristics, an indirect adaptive controller has been designed. Consequently, models of actuator and process are presented and the estimation of the present parameters by a recursive least square algorithm is outlined. Once the parameters are known, the control polynomials are calculated {{on the basis of}} a pole placement control approach. First experimental results of a force controlled milling process are put forward...|$|R
40|$|The {{temporal}} and spatial regulation of cytokinesis requires an interaction between the anaphase mitotic spindle and the cell cortex. However, the relative roles of the spindle asters or the central spindle bundle are not clear in mammalian cells. The central spindle normally serves as a platform to localize key regulators of cell cleavage, including passenger proteins. Using time-lapse and immunofluorescence analysis, we have addressed the consequences of eliminating the central spindle by ablation of PRC 1, a microtubule bundling protein that {{is critical to the}} formation of the central spindle. Without a central <b>spindle,</b> the asters <b>guide</b> the equatorial cortical accumulation of anillin and actin, and of the passenger proteins, which organize into a subcortical ring in anaphase. Furrowing goes to completion, but abscission to create two daughter cells fails. We conclude the central spindle bundle is required for abscission but not for furrowing in mammalian cells...|$|R
40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kar 9 p, {{one player}} in <b>spindle</b> alignment, <b>guides</b> the bud-ward <b>spindle</b> pole by linking astral {{microtubule}} plus ends to Myo 2 p-based transport along actin cables {{generated by the}} formins Bni 1 p and Bnr 1 p and the polarity determinant Bud 6 p. Initially, Kar 9 p labels both poles but progressively singles out the bud-ward pole. Here, we show that this polarization requires cell polarity determinants, actin cables, and microtubules. Indeed, in a bud 6 bni 1 mutant or upon direct depolymerization of actin cables Kar 9 p symmetry increased. Furthermore, symmetry was selec-tively induced by myo 2 alleles, preventing Kar 9 p binding to the Myo 2 p cargo domain. Kar 9 p polarity was rebuilt after transient disruption of microtubules, dependent on cell polarity and actin cables. Symmetry breaking also occurred after transient depolymerization of actin cables, with Kar 9 p increasing at the spindle pole engaging in repeated cycles of Kar 9 p-mediated transport. Kar 9 p returning to the spindle pole on shrinking astral microtubules may contribute toward this bias. Thus, Myo 2 p transport along actin cables may support a feedback loop by which delivery of astral microtubule plus ends sustains Kar 9 p polarized recruitment to the bud-ward spindle pole. Our findings also explain the link between Kar 9 p polarity and the choice setting aside the old spindle pole for daughter-bound fate...|$|R
40|$|Oriented cell {{division}} {{is a fundamental}} determinant of tissue organization. Simple epithelia divide symmetrically in {{the plane of the}} monolayer to preserve organ structure during epithelial morphogenesis and tissue turnover. For this to occur, mitotic spindles must be stringently oriented in the Z-axis, thereby establishing the perpendicular division plane between daughter cells. Spatial cues are thought to play important roles in spindle orientation, notably during asymmetric {{cell division}}. The molecular nature of the cortical cues that <b>guide</b> the <b>spindle</b> during symmetric cell division, however, is poorly understood. Here we show directly {{for the first time that}} cadherin adhesion receptors are required for planar spindle orientation in mammalian epithelia. Importantly, spindle orientation was disrupted without affecting tissue cohesion or epithelial polarity. This suggests that cadherin receptors can serve as cues for spindle orientation during symmetric cell division. We further show that disrupting cadherin function perturbed the cortical localization of APC, a microtubule-interacting protein that was required for planar spindle orientation. Together, these findings establish a novel morphogenetic function for cadherin adhesion receptors to <b>guide</b> <b>spindle</b> orientation during symmetric cell division...|$|R

Analisar o processo de gestão da comercialização na cadeia agroindustrial familiar do açúcar mascavo e os reflexos na sua viabilização é o objeto deste estudo. As análises se orientam pelos conceitos de cadeia de produção agroindustrial, qualidade, comercialização e competitividade, e se sustentam empiricamente nas experiências de duas agroindústrias, cujas informações foram obtidas através de entrevistas semi-estruturadas com integrantes da cadeia, analisadas pelo método de análise de conteúdo, através de observação participante e literatura. Os eixos privilegiados para análise foram a qualidade objetiva e subjetiva do produto, a qualificação profissional dos envolvidos na produção e comercialização, e a infraestrutura de comercialização disponível. Conclui-se que, dentre os principais fatores facilitadores e/ou dificultadores, a cadeia familiar de açúcar mascavo apresenta instabilidade quanto à qualidade do produto (padronização, registro, embalagem, etc.); a falta de qualificação profissional nos segmentos, e especialmente no conhecimento de mercado, inviabiliza a eficiência competitiva; e a infraestrutura de comercialização (transporte, estocagem, comunicação, pontos de venda, etc.) não está articulada entre si e nem com o mercado, operando-se de forma ainda tradicional. O atendimento a essas demandas, no que se refere à gestão da comercialização, constitui condição para viabilizar a cadeia familiar do açúcar mascavo na região estudada. Marketing {{policy is}} considered critical for competitiveness {{of the family}} agribusiness. Its efficiency {{is a result of}} the performance of several chain links. The aim of this study is to analyze the marketing policy process of the family agribusiness on the industrial chain of brown sugar and the reflection on its practicability. The analyses were supported by the concepts of agribusiness production chain, quality, marketing, and competitiveness, and empirically live on the experiences of two firms, whose information was obtained by mean:, of unstructured interviews with some components of the chain. They were examined through contents analysis, participant observation, and bibliography. Objective and subjective quality of the product and qualification of workers involved in the production and marketing processes, as well as available infrastructure of marketing are the <b>guide</b> <b>spindles</b> for analysis. It follows that, among the main constrains and/or enhancers, the family agribusiness on the industrial chain of brown sugar is not stable when it comes to product quality (standards, records, packaging, etc); the lack of professional qualification in the segments, especially concerning market knowledge, makes competitive efficiency impossible; infrastructure of marketing (transportation, storage, communication, points of purchase, etc.) is not intra-linked or linked with the market, and firms still work traditionally. Attention at those matters in the interest of marketing policies amounts to a condition for the practicability of a family industrial chain of brown sugar in the studied region...|$|R
