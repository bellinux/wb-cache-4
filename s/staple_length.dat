5|$|Polled Dorsets are a {{medium-sized}} sheep that are long lived and prolific, heavy milkers. They produce hardy lambs with moderate growth and maturity that yield heavily muscled carcasses. Their fleece is very white, strong, close, free from dark fiber and extends down the legs. When shorn, fleece averages {{between five and}} nine pounds (2.23 to 4kg) in ewes and fifty to seventy percent of their fleece can be used. The <b>staple</b> <b>length</b> ranges from 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10cm) with a numeric count of 46's-58's. The fiber diameter ranges from 27.0 to 33.0 microns. At maturity, ewes weigh between 150 and 200 pounds (67 to 91kg), some weighing more in show condition. Mature rams range in weight from 225 to 275 pounds (102 to 125kg). Dorsets are noted {{for their ability to}} be bred more than once per year and are commonly used in crossbreeding to produce females for out-of-season breeding. They {{are one of the few}} breeds that have this characteristic. Multiple births are common and they work well in commercial operations, including programs where rams are specifically used to sire lambs for slaughter. These rams are known as terminal sires since their genetics are more suitable for slaughter than breeding purposes.|$|E
25|$|A tightly {{spun wool}} yarn made from fibre {{with a long}} <b>staple</b> <b>length</b> in it is called worsted. It is hand spun from combed top, and the fibres all lie in the same {{direction}} as the yarn. A woollen yarn, in contrast, is hand spun from a rolag or other carded fibre (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The woollen yarn, thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally bulkier yarn. There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short draw creates worsted yarns, and long draw creates woollen yarns. Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a semi-worsted yarn.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Staple</b> <b>length,</b> a {{property}} of staple fibre, {{is a term}} referring to {{the average length of}} a group of fibres of any composition. <b>Staple</b> <b>length</b> depends on the origin of the fibres.

DuPont created the first acrylic fibers in 1941 and trademarked them under the name Orlon. It was first developed in the mid-1940s but was not produced in large quantities until the 1950s. Strong and warm, acrylic fiber is often used for sweaters and tracksuits and as linings for boots and gloves, {{as well as in}} furnishing fabrics and carpets.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the influence of transient manipulation of thyroid hormone status at a time corresponding with foetal primary wool follicle initiation. Pregnant Merino ewes (n = 12 per treatment) were treated daily between gestational days 55 and 64 with control (vehicle), exogenous thyroxine (T 4) or propylthiouracil (PTU), an inhibitor of T 4 synthesis, and conversion to the active form of the thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine). There were no significant differences in birth weight, gestational lengths and birth coat scores of the resultant lambs. The total primary and secondary follicle densities were significantly lower in lambs exposed to exogenous T 4 compared with other treatments (P < 0. 05). However, the T 4 group displayed a higher proportion of mature secondary follicles (reflected by increased mature secondary follicle densities and mature secondary/primary follicle ratios) than the other treatment groups (P < 0. 05). The skin morphology of the lambs differed 12 months later, with the T 4 group having significantly higher total follicle densities compared with the PTU group, largely attributed to increased mature and total secondary follicle densities. However, this increase in wool follicle densities did not translate to differences in the fleece yields and weight, fibre diameter, <b>staple</b> <b>lengths</b> or any other fibre parameters. This study showed that transient manipulation of thyroid hormone status during foetal primary follicle initiation does have long-term consequences on the morphology of wool follicles, in particular the maturity of secondary wool follicles.

50|$|Production of ultra-fine fibers (finer than 0.7 denier) {{dates back}} to the late 1950s, using melt-blown {{spinning}} and flash spinning techniques. However, only fine <b>staples</b> of random <b>length</b> could be manufactured and very few applications could be found.

Okamoto's discoveries, together with those of Dr. Toyohiko Hikota, resulted in many industrial applications. Among these was Ultrasuede, one of the first successful synthetic microfibers, which found its way onto the market in the 1970s. Microfiber's use in the textile industry then expanded.

There exist several proofs that stapled sequences exist for any N # 17.
