In {{the event of}} a vacancy in the office, the President of the City Council becomes acting mayor, and the council has 30 days to name an interim mayor. If no interim mayor is named, the Council President continues as acting mayor until a successor is elected, or the council reorganizes and selects a new President. Prior to 1971, there was no automatic <b>succession</b> <b>law.</b> The office was left vacant for 47 days in 1963 when the City Council failed to reach a decision on appointing an interim mayor.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the same}} {{debate over the}} half-foreign Prince Chula Chakrabongse {{occurred}} again. It was argued that King Vajiravudh had virtually exempted the prince's father from the ban in the <b>Succession</b> <b>Law,</b> and the crown might thus be passed to him.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the lack}} of <b>succession</b> <b>law</b> and a strong concept of meritocracy, {{whenever}} the succession was in dispute, princely governors or powerful dignitaries claiming their merit gathered their forces and moved on the capital to press their claims, culminating in several bloody coups.|$|E

25|$|In October, {{several months}} after the wedding, Commonwealth leaders pledged that they would {{implement}} changes in British royal <b>succession</b> <b>law</b> to adopt absolute primogeniture, meaning that the first child of the Duke and Duchess, whether boy or girl, would be next in line to the throne after their father.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate on}} {{amending}} the Crown's <b>succession</b> <b>law</b> {{came to the}} forefront on 31 October 2005, when Infanta Leonor was born to the current King and Queen of Spain. Amending the law to absolute primogeniture, known in French as aînesse intégrale would allow the first-born to inherit the throne, whether the heir be male or female. The Zapatero administration of the day proclaimed its intention to amend the <b>succession</b> <b>law,</b> however {{with the birth of}} the king's second daughter the issue was placed on the back burner. Paving the way, in 2006 King Juan Carlos issued a decree reforming the succession to noble titles from male preference primogeniture to absolute primogeniture. Since the order of succession to the Crown is codified in the Constitution, its reform mandates a complicated process that involves a dissolution of parliament, a constitutional election, and a referendum.|$|E

As President pro tempore, and therefore Acting Vice President, under the presidential <b>succession</b> <b>law</b> {{in place at the}} time, Atchison was believed by some to be Acting President.|$|E

25|$|Offering {{the throne}} to Prince Prajadhipok {{was not without}} a debate. In doing so, another {{candidate}} was bypassed: Prince Chula Chakrabongse, son of the late Field Marshal Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath of Phitsanulok, who before his death had been the heir-apparent to King Vajiravudh. It was questioned whether the <b>Succession</b> <b>Law</b> enacted by King Vajiravudh actually barred Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath (and for that matter, Prince Chula Chakrabongse) from succession {{on the grounds that}} he married a foreigner (Russian). However, his marriage had taken place before this law was enacted and had been endorsed by King Chulalongkorn himself. There was no clear resolution, but in the end the many candidates were passed over and Prince Prajadhipok was enthroned.|$|E
25|$|Llywelyn the Great was {{determined}} to enforce the right of legitimate sons in Welsh <b>succession</b> <b>law</b> to bring Gwynedd in line with other Christian countries in Europe.(Cite sources?) However, by promoting his younger son Dafydd he encountered considerable support for his elder son Gruffudd from traditionalists in Gwynedd, as well as dealing with his acts of revolt. But if he held him prisoner, the support for Gruffudd could not be transformed into anything more dangerous. Although Dafydd lost {{one of his most}} important supporters when his mother died in 1237, he retained the support of Ednyfed Fychan, the Seneschal of Gwynedd and the wielder of great political influence. After Llywelyn suffered a paralytic stroke in 1237, Dafydd took an increasing role in government. Dafydd ruled Gwynedd following his father's death in 1240.|$|E
25|$|On 6 September 2006, the Emperor {{celebrated the}} birth of his first grandson, Prince Hisahito, the third child of the Emperor's younger son. Prince Hisahito is the first male heir born to the Japanese {{imperial}} family in 41 years (since his father Prince Akishino) and could avert a possible succession crisis as the Emperor's elder son, the Crown Prince Naruhito, has only one daughter, Princess Aiko. Under Japan's male-only <b>succession</b> <b>law,</b> Princess Aiko is not eligible for the throne. The birth of Prince Hisahito could mean that proposed changes to the law to allow Aiko to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne will not go through after being temporarily shelved following the announcement of Princess Kiko's third pregnancy in February 2006. The supporters of changes criticized the current law as it placed a burden on the few aging males old enough to perform royal duties as females left the family.|$|E

5000|$|According to Toffoli and Benoit, Canada now {{has its own}} <b>succession</b> <b>laws,</b> {{not only}} via the {{principle}} of received law, but also {{by virtue of the}} Canadian Cabinet's request and consent to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, which, according to section 4 of the Statute of Westminster, brought that act to Canada as [...] "part of the law of that Dominion". The Canadian parliament's subsequent Succession to the Throne Act 1937 (required only by convention outlined in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster) ratified the Cabinet's earlier action and contains the full text of His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act, which itself outlines its effects on the Act of Settlement 1701 and Royal Marriages Act 1772. (Further proof of the existence of the Royal Marriages Act in Canadian law is, according to Toffoli, provided by the approval by the Queen in her Canadian Council in 1981 to the marriage of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer separately to the same approval given by the Queen in her British Council.) Thus, Canada's Succession to the Throne Act 1937 [...] "is the statutory repository of the <b>law</b> of <b>Succession</b> for Canada", meaning [...] "it is irrelevant whether or not <b>succession</b> <b>laws</b> are enumerated in the schedule to the Constitution Act, 1982, as laws had already been patriated in 1937..." [...] Given the subsequent repeal of section 4 of the Statute of Westminster in Canada and the enactment of section 2 of the Canada Act, 1982, the United Kingdom's Succession to the Crown Act 2012 has no effect on Canada's <b>succession</b> <b>laws,</b> regardless of the Canadian parliament's assent to it. He claimed the Canadian parliament could possibly alter Canada's <b>succession</b> <b>laws</b> simply by amending Schedule 2 of the 1937 act. The necessity of the consent of the provinces open to debate.|$|R
