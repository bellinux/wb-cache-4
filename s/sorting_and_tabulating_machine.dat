5000|$|Hollerith {{founded the}} <b>Tabulating</b> <b>Machine</b> Company (1896) {{which was one}} of four {{companies}} that were amalgamated (via stock acquisition) to form a fifth company, Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), later renamed [...] International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Other companies entering the punched card business included The Tabulator Limited (1902) later renamed the British <b>Tabulating</b> <b>Machine</b> Company Limited, Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft mbH (Dehomag) (1911),Powers Accounting Machine Company (1911) , Remington Rand (1927), and Groupe Bull (1931). [...] These companies, and others, manufactured and marketed a variety of punched cards and unit record <b>machines</b> for creating, <b>sorting,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tabulating</b> punched cards, even after the development of electronic computers in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|These companies, and others, {{manufactured}} {{and marketed}} {{a variety of}} general-purpose unit record <b>machines</b> for creating, <b>sorting,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tabulating</b> punched cards, even after the development of computers in the 1950s.

50|$|Bull {{continued}} {{working on}} improvements for {{the machine and}} also in developing new machines such as a <b>sorting</b> <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> a new <b>tabulating</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{punched cards}} <b>and</b> the <b>tabulating</b> <b>machines</b> were {{initially}} {{developed by the}} U.S. engineer Herman Hollerith and were used for first time in Norway by Statistics Norway in 1894.|$|R
2500|$|An {{explosion}} of new discoveries and inventions took place, {{a process called}} the Second Industrial Revolution. The electric light, telephone, steam turbine, internal combustion engine, automobile, phonograph, typewriter <b>and</b> <b>tabulating</b> <b>machine</b> {{were some of the}} many inventions of the period. New processes for making steel and chemicals such as dyes and explosives were invented. [...] The pneumatic tire, improved ball bearings, machine tools and newly developed metal stamping techniques enabled the large scale production of bicycles in the 1890s. Another significant development was the widespread introduction of electric street railways (trams, trolleys or streetcars) in the 1890s.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} form of automated employee {{scheduling and}} managing of employee hours was the Punch Card. The idea first created by Basile Bouchon developed {{the control of}} a loom by punched holes in paper tape in 1725. Herman Hollerith improved the design. IBM manufactured and marketed a variety of unit record <b>machines</b> for creating, <b>sorting,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tabulating</b> punched cards, even after expanding into electronic computers in the late 1950s. IBM developed punched card technology into {{a powerful tool for}} business data-processing and produced an extensive line of general purpose unit record machines.|$|R
5000|$|Ohlman {{first started}} work on {{information}} indexing in 1957 (working for SDC) {{when he noticed}} the peek-a-boo (coordinate) indexing system that searched for documents at the Lincoln Laboratory wasted space {{on most of the}} cards.Ohlman developed a system using IBM punch cards <b>and</b> <b>tabulating</b> <b>machines</b> that used one punch card for every document title, with significant title words on each card. The cards were <b>sorted</b> <b>and</b> run through a printer to produce the final result. Ohlman named this result a [...] "permutation index" [...] (or Permuterm for short) because the words went through a cyclic permutation process.The first actual permutation index was issued later that year as a subject guide to SAGE programming documents—based on 1,800 documents (2/3 from the Lincoln Laboratory).In 1958 Ohlman submitted a paper titled [...] "Subject-word letter frequencies with applications to superimposed coding" [...] to the International Conference on Scientific Information (ICSI) in Washington, DC. The paper was accepted by the chairman ofSection 5, Hans Peter Luhn.|$|R
50|$|The {{processing}} of the 1880 census data {{took so long}} (eight years) that the Census Bureau contracted Herman Hollerith to design <b>and</b> build a <b>tabulating</b> <b>machine</b> {{to be used for}} the next census. The 1880 census also led to the discovery of the Alabama paradox.|$|R
50|$|In 1896 the <b>Tabulating</b> <b>Machine</b> Company leased some {{machines}} to a railway company but quickly {{focused on the}} challenges of the largest statistical endeavor of its day - the 1900 US Census. After winning the government contract and completing the project, Hollerith was faced with the challenge of sustaining the company in non-Census years. He returned to targeting private businesses both in the United States and abroad, attempting to identify industry applications for his semiautomatic punching, <b>tabulating</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorting</b> <b>machines.</b> Flint bought the business for $2.3 million (of which Hollerith got $1.2 million) in 1911.|$|R
500|$|Some New York skyscrapers complemented traditional, cubicle offices {{linked by}} corridors, with larger, more open-plan spaces called [...] "general offices". These maximised {{the number of}} workers that could fitted into a given space and {{provided}} for greater flexibility. Expensive corporate suites were also created during the 1930s, especially on Wall Street, typically on {{the highest levels of the}} buildings. These were used by the corporate executives and were usually lavishly outfitted in a range of traditional and exotic styles. The lobbies of these skyscrapers remained grand affairs, although some banks now eschewed renting out space to shops and restaurants in favour of a more exclusive atmosphere. The largest skyscrapers held up to 16,000 workers, although between 5,000 and 10,000 was more common, and the buildings held a wide range of services to support them, including beauty salons, private luncheon clubs, chiropodists and gymnasiums. A skyscraper such as the Cities Service Building directly employed over 200 staff to manage and protect the property. The technology within the offices also grew still more sophisticated, with dictating, automatic typing <b>and</b> <b>tabulating</b> <b>machines</b> being used by teams of ever more specialised office workers.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{jurisdiction}} using a {{punched card}} system, voters choose by removing or [...] "punching out" [...] a perforated chad from the ballot next each choice, sometimes with tools {{as simple as}} a pin, but usually with a ballot marking device such as the Votomatic. The ballot may be pre-printed with candidates and referenda, or may be a generic ballot placed under a printed list of candidates <b>and</b> referenda. <b>Tabulating</b> <b>machines</b> count ballots after the polls close. Officials may manually count the ballots {{in the event of a}} dispute. Punched card voting systems are being replaced by other voting systems because of a high rate of inaccuracy related to the incomplete removal of the perforated chad and the inaccessibility to voters with disabilities.|$|R
40|$|Following {{the extreme}} drought of 1934, the Nebraska Pasture Contest was {{organized}} to collect information, improve grasslands, and disseminate information on pasture management. Elvin Frolik and Dr. A. W. Peterson devised questionnaires administered by county agents. Data was entered on IBM punch cards, mechanically <b>sorted,</b> <b>tabulated,</b> <b>and</b> printed. This study {{deals with the}} farm management phase...|$|R
5000|$|The 1890 census was {{the first}} to be {{compiled}} using methods invented by Herman Hollerith and was overseen by Superintendents Robert P. Porter (1889-1893) and Carroll D. Wright (1893-1897). Data was entered on a machine readable medium, punched cards, <b>and</b> <b>tabulated</b> by <b>machine.</b> The net effect of the many changes from the 1880 census: the larger population, the number of data items to be collected, the Census Bureau headcount, the volume of scheduled publications, and the use of Hollerith's electromechanical tabulators, was to reduce the time required to process the census from eight years for the 1880 census to six years for the 1890 census. The total population of 62,947,714, the family, or rough, count, was announced after only six weeks of processing (punched cards were not used for this tabulation). The public reaction to this tabulation was disbelief, as it was widely believed that the [...] "right answer" [...] was at least 75,000,000.|$|R
40|$|Transcript, 31 pp. Humphreys, {{a former}} {{managing}} director of International Computers, Limited (ICL), reviews {{the history of the}} British computer industry. Topics include: the termination in 1949 of the trade agreement between IBM <b>and</b> the British <b>Tabulating</b> <b>Machine</b> Company, the merger in 1959 of British <b>Tabulating</b> <b>and</b> the Powers Samas Company into International Computers and Tabulators, Ltd. (ICT), and the merger in 1968 of English Electric Computers Limited and ICT into ICL. Humphreys explains how the last merger was enacted by the government to establish a single national computer company. He recalls the government's pride, as expressed by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, in maintaining a position in the international computer industry. Humphreys also discusses {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the British computer industry, and compares the management of the British and American computer industries. He mentions the European Economic Community's efforts to establish Unidata, a multinational computer company, and the problems associated with conducting business across Europe's linguistic and cultural boundaries...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the electronic digital computer was preceded by {{a long history of}} mechanical <b>and</b> electromechanical <b>tabulating</b> <b>machines.</b> In the latter years of the nineteenth century numerous office machines—typewriters, adding machines, cash registers, mechanical calculators, and billing and accounting devices—were introduced. In 1886 Herman Hollerith, a statistician employed at the U. S Census Office, designed and built an electrically run tabulator that used punch card inputs and electrical card reading (Cortada 1993; Ruttan 2001 : 317 - 319). The Hollerith machine was able to process census data in one-third the time it would have taken with handwritten tally sheets (Cortada 1993; Ruttan 2001 : 317 - 319). In this Chapter I focus on the role of military procurement on the {{development of}} the computer industry. During and immediately after World War II major efforts were made, with the support of the military, to develop fully electronic computing machines. The role of the military in driving the development of computer, semiconductor and software technologies cannot be overemphasized. These technologies were, until well into the 1960 ’s, nourished by markets that were almost completely dependent on the defense, energy and space industries. ...|$|R
