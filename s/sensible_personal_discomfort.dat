This distinction is useful when evaluating studies which acritically apply screening instruments with a diagnostic purpose.

In a discussion regarding communication between comic book authors, and whether writers were bothered when their creations were altered, or re-characterized, by other authors of a shared universe, Nicieza's treatment of Anarky was criticized. In addressing the concerns of his detractors, Nicieza submitted that he fully agreed with the criticisms by Alan Grant. As Nicieza explained, his intention was to deliberately alter the concept the Anarky mantle represented, while attempting to respect the characterization of Lonnie Machin. For this reason, Nicieza also saw little reason to communicate with Grant for feedback, and so made no overtures to Anarky's creator. Nicieza also confessed to his <b>personal</b> <b>discomfort</b> with communicating with Grant, given the latter's estrangement from DC Comics.|$|R

The aim of the paper is to analyse how the institutional logics shape the development of TFR over time. The aim will be pursued by the analysis of a case study of telemedicine deployment in a Swedish county during a 12 years period.

Using focus groups discussions with parents of 3 - 7 years olds in the UK, this study explores some of the challenges parents report in dealing with early sexual socialisation as well as the reasons they cite for restricting young children’s sexual awareness and access to knowledge.

This article reviews best practice with respect to PIVCs in cancer patients and considers the necessity for bundling these actions. Two care bundles, addressing both insertion and ongoing care and maintenance, are proposed.

One of the most affordable aesthetic options is a directly-placed, composite restoration. The overall success of such restorations not only depends on the clinical situation, but also on the expertise of the dentist and the time he/she is willing to spend for the fee he/she will be paid. Placing a successful posterior composite restoration is a technique-sensitive, time-consuming art and any shortcuts used during the placement of such a restoration is sure to lead to post-operative problems.

All of these motivations for substance use among adolescents may be well founded according to literature on adolescent development. The present cross-national study explores the relationships between adolescent psychological adjustment, peers, activities, and substance use. The Italian and Dutch versions of the Me and My Health questionnaire were administered to 970 Italian and Dutch adolescents (both genders, mean age 16 years old). In both countries, substance use was more strongly related to peer relationships and activities than to psychological adjustment.

Unfortunately, if a customer considers that <b>personal</b> <b>discomfort</b> outweighs money savings after DLC shutting down of home appliances, DLC solution can be rejected. This paper proposes the way to remediate customer comfort concerns by pre-storing additional energy in electric loads before their disconnection from the grid. We take electric tank water heaters as an illustrative example of residential loads with storage. To illuminate our approach we first show how to balance electric consumption for pre-storing with user thermal discomfort for a single water heater. Then, we illustrate how the approach can be scaled-up to a multiple-boiler scenario, when ten remotely controlled boilers act next to fifty non-controlled boilers. The simulations for the latter case show that the expected user thermal discomfort can be significantly reduced {{at the cost of}} a reasonable increase of electricity demand preceding DLC event...|$|R

We presented a report of six cases of vascular malformations treated with monoethanolamine. There were 3 male and 3 female patients, with an age range of 20 to 68 years. The patients were submitted to applications according to clinical response and/or tolerability. In all cases, low-flow vascular lesions were recorded and submitted to infiltration with 2. 5 % monoethanolamine, directly into the lesions. The volume applied was approximately the middle of affected area. Vascular lesions were characterized as low-flow due to absence of arterial pulsation and flat consistence.
