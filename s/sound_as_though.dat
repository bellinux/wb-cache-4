Kumu hula (dance masters), were said to be able to either make the flute <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were chanting, or to chant as they played. Kumu hula Leilehua Yuen {{is one of the few}} contemporary Hawaiian musicians to perform with the nose flute in this manner.|$|E

He said: [...] "I came into the studios early {{every day for a}} week to sing it by myself because at first my voice was too clear. I wanted it to <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I'd been performing it on stage all week." [...] Lennon thought he should have sung it, remarking that it was more his style.|$|E

In casting Italian actors, {{he held a}} casting call in Rome. The Italian actors, all born in Rome, were coached to <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were from Tuscany. The actors portraying soldiers underwent a two-week boot camp, supervised by senior military advisor Billy Budd, a 15-year Royal Marine veteran who {{had served in the}} Falklands War.|$|E

[...] The chorus includes a clip of Bale saying [...] "it's fucking distracting", and [...] "What don't you fuckin' understand?". The sound collage includes clips of Barbra Streisand from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of former-President George W. Bush, making it <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Streisand is arguing with Bale. Piane told the Associated Press: [...] "I don't know if Christian Bale is enjoying it, but I hope he does. I think I've taken something that maybe made him look really bad and turned it into something that all these people are enjoying." ...|$|E
500|$|Songwriter Stephen Schwartz had {{originally}} been slated to write both the music and lyrics for Mulan until he ultimately left the project to write songs for rival studio DreamWorks' animated film The Prince of Egypt (1998) instead after Disney executives forced him {{to choose between the}} two. Schwartz had completed only two songs for Mulan before his resignation, one of which was entitled [...] "China Doll" [...] which, according to Schwartz, [...] "more or less corresponds to the scene in the film in which Mulan goes to the Matchmaker". Schwartz was eventually replaced with composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel, who wrote [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] with which to replace Schwartz's [...] "China Doll". Disney cast American singer and actress Marni Nixon, one of Hollywood's most prolific playback singers, as the singing voice of Grandmother Fa, Mulan's paternal grandmother. Nixon received the sheet music for [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] to review prior to auditioning for the role. The filmmakers then showed Nixon a drawing of the character, by whose comedic appearance the singer was immediately [...] "enchanted", telling herself [...] "you've just got to give her a voice... or, in this case, an unvoice." [...] Improvising her performance, Nixon decided to make the character <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she was merely attempting to sing as opposed to actually singing, keeping in mind that the elderly character is toothless. Nixon also made no effort to sound like the actress who had been cast as Grandmother Fa's speaking voice at the time, determining that the two performers sound nothing alike upon listening to the actress' recording. Nixon had almost reconsidered auditioning for the role upon realizing how different she sounded from Grandmother Fa's speaking voice actress.|$|E

[...] Dave Hughes of Slant Magazine also gave the album a score of one star out of five and said that it sadly [...] "takes sound and fury, signifying nothing, to new depths." ...|$|E

Dupéré describes the music with an [...] "African flavor" [...] and states that he wants the audience {{to feel that the}} show is [...] "full of energy". He says that the music is not intended to <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it belongs to a specific time frame. [...] "It could be from medieval times or even 200 years in the future...the music itself is ageless." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also {{known as}} Brightside Bridge, this carries Weedon Street, which links Brightside Lane with Attercliffe Common. This bridge is {{downstream}} of Brightside Weir. The bridge is {{mentioned in the}} records of the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864 as follows: [...] "The watchman on duty near Brightside Bridge had a very narrow escape. When passing the bridge he was startled by a singular <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the steam from a distant engine had suddenly been let off, and immediately after the flood came rushing down. The water rose rapidly over the bridge and the road. To escape he mounted the wall, intending to walk along it to some place of safety; but in another moment he felt the wall tremble beneath him. He then jumped off it, and rushed through the waters nearly breast high towards the Midland railway, which he succeeded in reaching, and down which he walked to Sheffield".|$|E
2500|$|Callas's vocal registers, however, {{were not}} {{seamlessly}} joined; Walter Legge writes, [...] "Unfortunately, {{it was only}} in quick music, particularly descending scales, that she completely mastered the art of joining the three almost incompatible voices into one unified whole, but until about 1960, she disguised those audible gear changes with cunning skill." [...] Rodolfo Celletti states, In certain areas of her range her voice also possessed a guttural quality. This would occur in the most delicate and troublesome areas of a soprano's voice—for instance where the lower and middle registers merge, between G and A. I would {{go so far as to}} say that here her voice had such resonances as to make one think at times of a ventriloquist... or else the voice could <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were resonating in a rubber tube. There was another troublesome spot... between the middle and upper registers. Here, too, around the treble F and G, there was often something in the sound itself which was not quite right, as though the voice were not functioning properly.|$|E

2500|$|But while Goldman {{was praised}} for its foresight, some argued its bets against the {{securities}} it created {{gave it a}} vested interest in their failure. These securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by April 2010, at least US$5 billion worth of the securities either carried [...] "junk" [...] ratings, or had defaulted. One CDO examined by critics which Goldman bet against, but also sold to investors, was the $800 million Hudson Mezzanine CDO issued in 2006. In the Senate Permanent Subcommittee hearings, Goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books. Unable to sell them directly, it included them in the underlying securities of the CDO and took the short side, but critics McLean and Nocera complained the CDO prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as [...] "'assets sourced from the Street', making it <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Goldman randomly selected the securities, instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book." [...] The CDO did not perform well and by March 2008—just 18 months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out [...] "about US$310 million to Goldman and others who had bet against it". Goldman's head of European fixed-income sales lamented in an email made public by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the [...] "real bad feeling across European sales about some of the trades we did with clients" [...] who had invested in the CDO. [...] "The damage this has done to our franchise is very significant." ...|$|E
2500|$|Consequently, his motifs and {{thematic}} {{concepts are}} developed {{in view of}} a real-reader situation that includes—but also searches beyond—academic special interest groups. His verse aims at reaching a wide public and achieves just this. He begins with a prying curiosity. [...] "We all should support independent and committed publishers. Only curious readers looking forward to these books can help us survive, for poetry mainly thrives on the commitment of enthusiastic publishers." [...] Leitner does not write {{with his back to}} the audience, but skillfully involves [...] "poetry into daily communicative processes." [...] Many poets, some of whom have entirely resigned from the necessity of finding an audience, oppose the intentional structure inherent in the compositional principle advocated by Leitner. The debate on a pluralistic public/governmental support of poetry, initiated by [...] in 2011, showed that clearly. While some poets and publishers became angry over Kutsch's criticism of badly planned public endowments of poetry, Leitner defended Kutsch saying that [...] "some comments (by contemporary poets) <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they have been written by moody children whose allowances have been threatened to be cut by their fatherland." [...] Leitner highlighted in this debate that poetry, which is supposed to be publicly funded, ought to be accessible to the public as well; otherwise, it should be privately financed. Thus the debate was not generally about governmental subsidies for the arts, in particular for literature. Instead, in Leitner's eyes, it was a debate on the conditions of and for aesthetic production. If a poet is to be funded by the state out of tax-payer resources, then such poets should accept the fact that it is [...] "not poetry that is providing for their material needs, but rather subsidies and prize money, which are often provided from tax-payer money." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's first song, [...] "My Boy", {{opens to}} crowd noise, {{engineered}} by Brendan Reilly and Aaron Sokell. Described as [...] "one {{of the few}} songs to <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it emerged from the 21st century", it {{was said to be}} a reference point and introduction to the [...] "classic girl group sound" [...] seen on Endlessly, and {{a combination of the two}} aforementioned styles. As with the rest of the album, it was written and produced by Duffy and Hammond. It was praised for its use of keyboards and percussion, played by Hammond, said to [...] "sound like piano's laughing", and [...] "creating a preponderance of beats that dig themselves into your brain", respectively. Lyrically, Duffy sings of [...] "the completely rude and judgemental comments made about her relationship with a significantly younger gentleman." [...] The next song, titled [...] "Too Hurt to Dance", was called a [...] "grand glitterball ballad", and is inspired by the music of the 1950s. Q named it the ninth best song of December 2010, whilst Kitty Empire of The Observer was critical of Duffy's voice on the song, noting that her [...] "quacking patent-leather vocal" [...] was of prevalence. This was in contrast to the disco music displayed in [...] "Keeping My Baby", which again received comparisons to the music of Minogue. Originally intended to be the second single released from the album, it was said to omit a tango style, and was both positively and negatively received by critics. As lyrically it is sung from the point of view of a pregnant girl, it was compared to the song [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986) by Madonna. The single [...] "Well, Well, Well" [...] follows. Said to debut Duffy's [...] "inner diva", the song, like [...] "Mercy" [...] (2008) is heavily influenced with Northern Soul, aided by a rhythm section provided by The Roots. Duffy was able too secure their part in the song and others on the album through telephoning the president of Island Def Jam Records, LA Reid. It was negatively reviewed by the BBC Chart Blog, as despite its provocative lyrics and challenging nature, [...] "it basically has one idea, one note, one refrain, and it stops and it starts and it repeats and repeats and repeats like someone is prodding and prodding at your chest." [...] The reviewer continued that the song was [...] "monumentally irritating", a sentiment that several reviewers echoed. Elsewhere, it was described as an [...] "instant classic".|$|E
