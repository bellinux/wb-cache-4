The test results indicate that the radial total stress, pore water pressure and shear stress on the pile shaft during installation, were strongly affected by the installation procedure; all three were found to increase when the jacking stoke length used during installation increased (or the number of cyclic load applications decreased). However, equalised radial effective stresses which control the long-term pile shaft capacity were found to be insensitive to the installation method. A simple expression is proposed which requires the results of a cone penetration test, laboratory measurements of the interface friction angle and the pile geometry is proposed to calculate the shaft resistance...|$|R

As for saturated soils, one can expect to find a strong correlation among stress history, volumetric state, and G 0. Initial shear stiffness was measured almost continuously along various isotropic stress paths, including compressions and drying–wetting single stages or cycles, by using the RCTS cell. The collected data demonstrate a strong dependency of G 0 on mean net stress (p – ua) and suction (ua – uw).

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this dissertation examines the physical and chemical changes that occur to in situ soil at the soil-pile interface for continuous flight auger piles installed in the Mercia Mudstone Group. Four Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) piles were installed in the Gunthorpe Member of the Mercia Mudstone Group, central England. The effect on the soil-pile interface of overrotation of the auger during installation, {{and the addition of}} water during installation were investigated. Once the piles had been left to cure, they were excavated and returned to City University, London, with the surrounding soil. The excavated piles and soil were examined using a variety of microscopic and macroscopic techniques including inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) and X-ray diffraction (XRD); with water contents, chemical content (ICP) and mineralogical content (XRD) tested. Plastic index and particle size distribution tests were used to show the physical effects of piling on the host soil and preliminary strength testing was carried out to provide insight into the strength characteristics of the soil surrounding the pile. In all four piles a distinct zone of remoulding was observed around the pile shaft. In each case the remoulded zone was a brown to red, clay rich layer varying between 0 mm and 55 mm in thickness. In almost all cases this remoulded zone had a structure and fabric which was not related to the in situ soil. Around all piles it was further noted that vertical fissures were present, and fanned out from the pile shaft in a clockwise direction. Two of the piles were installed with the addition of water. Around these piles it was noted that the remoulded layer often split into two or three distinct layers, with one of these layers often containing millimetre scale aggregations of green <b>silt.</b> <b>Tests</b> showed a higher percentage of clays present within this remoulded zone, and indicated that SiO 2 (a major rock forming element and considered by some authors to be an aggregating agent within the Mercia Mudstone Group) was more abundant within remoulded than undisturbed soil. The clay fraction showed a low abundance of high swelling clays in all cases. It was concluded that installing piles within the Mercia Mudstone Group causes remoulding of the soil directly adjacent to the pile shaft. The least remoulding occurred when the pile was augered normally with no added water. All four remoulded zones contained fissures, fanning clockwise from the pile, however, these were more pronounced in the dry piles, while the wet piles had a more massive, granular texture to the remoulded zone. For all piles, except the pile which was over-rotated and installed with no added water, the percentage of clays within the remoulded zone was greater than outside the remoulded zone. This indicates that the aggregates of clays found naturally within the Mercia Mudstone Group may be split into their constituent clays during the piling process...|$|R

This modification of maximum dry density could alter the hydraulic conductivity of the soil. The main object {{of this study was to}} assess the impact of lime-stabilization on a silt soil microstructure and then on saturated hydraulic conductivity. An investigation at the microscopic level with mercury intrusion porosimetry showed that lime treatment induced the formation of a new small class, with a diameter lower than 3 × 103 Å in the compacted soil. This class is responsible for the difference in dry density between the treated and the untreated sample after compaction. It is shown that this small pores class was not altered by the compaction water content, the compaction procedure or the dry density. As in untreated soils, only the larger pores were modified by the compaction water content and the compaction procedure in the lime treated samples.

Less attention has been given to the capability of the GPR in detecting structures within the active layer. In this paper, using 500 MHz GPR data from a thermokarst site in the Arctic Coastal Plain, we demonstrate that GPR can retrieve, when present, the internal stratigraphy of the thawed layer. We recognized two types of thermokarst-related microtopographic units: dry-and-uniform peaty hummocks with a thin (∼ 30 cm) active layer and inter-hummock depressions with a thicker (∼ 60 cm) active layer characterized by two different layers—a surface peat layer on top of <b>silt</b> confirmed by <b>test</b> pits. Radar wave velocity analysis, done with a common-midpoint survey, suggests a contrast in volumetric water content (87 % and 45 % for the upper and lower layers, respectively). The subsurface radar wave velocity suggests that the porous peat layer contains more water (87 % by volume) than the underlying silt layer (45 % by volume), resulting in a strong dielectric contrast and a strong radar reflection.

Effective implicit learning was demonstrated by there being a significant advantage in both speed and accuracy in responding to predictable than to unpredictable S 2 stimuli.

40|$|Though soil {{liquefaction}} {{is commonly}} associated with loose sands, silt {{has been known to}} liquefy during large earthquakes. Unlike sands, however, the cyclic resistance of silt is difficult to quantify because current semi-empirical correlations are based largely on sandy soils having a fines content of less than about 35 %. To better understand the cyclic resistance of silt, a cyclic triaxial testing program was conducted on non-plastic silts recovered from various sites in the Providence, RI area. A new modified moist tamping method was introduced for preparing reconstituted samples of <b>silt</b> for liquefaction <b>testing.</b> By comparing the results to undisturbed block samples, the new moist tamping method was shown to capture the in situ behavior up to the initiation of liquefaction. Correlations were developed for two Providence silts that relate cyclic resistance to shear wave velocity (VS). One of the correlations was used to estimate the in situ cyclic resistance of a silt deposit at a study site using in situ VS measurements made with a seismic cone. The cyclic resistance estimated from the new correlation compared well to the resistance predicted using current Standard Penetration Test (SPT) and Cone Penetration Test (CPT) -based methods. An analysis of liquefaction potential was also performed at the study site. The seismic loading on the subsurface soils was estimated from ground response analyses using actual recorded earthquake time histories.

The trial’s task was to investigate if a five micron self cleaning screen filter {{can be an effective}} technology when used {{near the end of the}} seawater pretreatment stream found in a conventional seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant. To assess the performance of the screen filter several key parameters were identified including backwash frequency, <b>silt</b> density index <b>testing,</b> turbidity, and pressure. The project originated from the desalination industry’s desire to look for alternative fine filtration technologies away from the commonly used cartridge filters. This project also outlines the scalability of the filter in an industrial setting with comparisons to the cartridge filters found at the Perth Seawater Desalination Plant (PSDP). The design required the filter to treat seawater from the Perth Seawater Desalination Plant, with the testing to occur at the National Centre of Excellence in Desalination Australia (NCEDA) in Rockingham, Western Australia. The trial was to last up to 6 weeks during the teaching period. The project faced several unexpected issues in implementing the design over the semester and unfortunately could not fulfill the requirement to conduct the pilot trial within this time. However preliminary testing was completed which confirmed the effective operation of the filter system. Primary objectives for the test were to see if the system design fulfilled its function and verify if certain parameters were attainable in regards to pressure, flow rate, and backwash cycle. The feedwater was brackish groundwater. Results showed: the filter system operated effectively; attained a system flow rate of 5 kiloliters per hour; attained the minimum system back pressure of 40 PSI; and successful automation of the backwash cycle and system.

40|$|The South African Gateway is a {{critical}} region for the water mass exchange between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. The variability in the interoceanic exchange is relevant to global climate change. High resolution seismic reflection data were collected in the Transkei Basin during R/V SONNE cruise SO 182 in 2005. These seismic observations have indicated that a large elongate mounded contourite drift, the Agulhas Drift, has been built up by eastward flows of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) since about 3 Ma. For {{a better understanding of}} the influences of the various currents on sediment transport patterns in the vicinity of the Agulhas Drift, the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) has been used to simulate the current system and suspended sediment transport processes. The results from current system simulation showed that a recurrent individual cyclonic eddy event is the key hydrodynamic feature in the Transkei Basin. These eddies are almost fixed in the center of the Transkei Basin and spread over the entire water column. Flow in their northern segments is eastward across the southern flank of the Agulhas Drift. These eddies are supposedly the result of perturbations in the Subtropical Convergence (STC) in the region of south of Africa, where planetary waves on the STC deform. The perturbations enhance the surface eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in the Transkei Basin. The high EKE is then transferred from the surface to the deep ocean, where it causes the formation of eddies at abyssal depth. Based on the ocean circulation simulations, grain size experiments were carried out to test the transport behaviors for 4 different silt grain size classes. Our simulations reveal that sediment transport patterns in the Transkei Basin are strongly influenced by the mesoscale eddies. During eddy events, <b>silts</b> at all <b>tested</b> grain sizes can be resuspended by the AABW along the northeastern flank of the Agulhas Plateau that borders the Transkei Bsin to the east, whereas not all of them can be further transported into the region of the Agulhas Drift. Coarse silt cannot be transported over long distances, but it is deposited in the vicinity of the resuspension area. Medium silt can be transported into this region of the Agulhas Drift, only when the eddy current is strong enough. Fine silt and very fine silt can easily be carried into the drift area. The simulations show that medium and fine silt can be deposited on the Agulhas Drift, whereas very fine silt is further transported out of the area into the southern Transkei Basin...|$|R
40|$|Earthquakes {{are natural}} calamities that {{occur as a}} result of sudden release of strain energy stored in fault planes. Earthquakes have been {{observed}} to cause huge damage to infrastructures and lives. Earthquakes result in development of fissures, abnormal or unequal movement of foundations, and loss of strength and stiffness of the soils. Liquefaction is attributed as a major cause for the loss of strength and stiffness of soil during earthquakes. In the past, liquefaction was attributed only to coarse-grained to medium-grained sand and was extensively studied but the fine-grained soils were generally considered as non-liquefiable. However, from observations during recent earthquakes, fine-grained soils having low plasticity (plasticity index (PI) 3 ̆c 20) have experienced ground failures due to liquefaction or large deformations. Moreover, laboratory experiments show that not only saturated cohesionless soils but also fine-grained soils may liquefy if certain criteria are met. One of the parameters which influences the liquefaction characteristics of fine-grained soils is its plasticity. This study may become helpful in understanding the effect of plasticity on liquefaction resistance of fine-grained soils. The objective of this study were to investigate the (1) effect of plasticity on pore pressure built up and deformation characteristics of fine-grained soils, and (2) effects of cyclic shear stress on liquefaction resistance of fine-grained soils. A total of 24 tests were conducted using a stress controlled cyclic triaxial testing machine on identically prepared specimens at an initial effective confining pressure of 5. 0 psi. The plasticity index (PI) was varied from non-plastic (NP) to 14. 53. Sil-Co-Sil # 40, a non-plastic commercial silt (product of US Silica Company) and EPK Kaolin clay (product of Edgar Minerals Inc.) were used as base materials. These materials were mixed in different proportions to obtain desired plasticity index. Out of the twenty-four tests, eleven tests were conducted on clean silt samples. Among the <b>tests</b> on clean <b>silt</b> samples, four <b>tests</b> were conducted on specimens having a post consolidation void ratio of 0. 74 to 0. 76. Further, six tests were conducted on specimens having a post consolidation void ratio of 0. 74 to 1. 04 by using a cyclic stress ratio (CSR) of 0. 2 and 0. 25. Seventeen tests were grouped to study the influence of plasticity on liquefaction characteristics of fine-grained soil. The PI of specimens tested ranged from non-plastic (NP) to 14. 53. Each of the specimens with a definite PI was tested at an initial confining pressure of 5. 0 psi using a CSR of 0. 2, 0. 3, and 0. 4. The results obtained from the tests were used to compare the effects of plasticity on liquefaction characteristics of fine-grained soils. Based on the limited tests conducted, it was observed that plasticity index had distinct influence on the cyclic strength of the samples. It was found that CSR required to cause a pre-determined strain in a given number of loading cycles reduces as the plasticity index increases from non-plastic (NP) to 3. 46, but increases for soils having PI greater than 3. 46. Moreover, the liquefaction resistance decreases with the increase in cyclic shear stress for all soils regardless of plasticity indices (PIs). The critical PI value corresponds to 15...|$|R

Finally, irradiation by means of gamma rays is proposed as an accelerated technique in order to simulate the natural ionizing radiations acting on stored tailings that, in many countries, are beginning to be re-used as backfill, landscaping material or feedstock for cement and concrete. Wet and dry silty samples were exposed to gamma rays and then characterized in order to study any possible physical and chemical modifications of the exposed matter. The starting point of this research is an available hydro-mechanical characterization of saturated tailings coming from Stava tailing dams collapsed in 1985 (Italy). The first series of experimental tests was carried out to study the hydraulic behaviour of the Stava tailings by means of water retention tests. To account for the heterogeneity of the tailing material within the basin, the dependency of the water retention relationship on grain size distribution and void ratio was investigated. In order to extend the limited range of matrix suction allowed by the axis translation technique, the water retention curves were also implemented with data obtained by indirect soil suction measurement and soil suction controlling methods, dew point technique and vapour equilibrium technique, respectively. Since the pre-shearing state of the soil has a relevant effect on the behaviour shown during shearing before reaching the critical state conditions, a second campaign of experimental tests, consisting in five mono-dimensional compression tests, was performed. Results were compared with those in saturated conditions obtained by Carrera (2008) in order to investigate the dependency of preconsolidation stress and stiffness of the soil on suction. Aimed to extend the hydraulic characterization and to approach the possible critical state in unsaturated conditions from drying and wetting sides, a third campaign of experimental tests was carried out by using a suction controlled triaxial cell and imposing different hydro-mechanical stress paths. Statically compacted silty samples were subjected at different suction levels, then isotropically consolidated at different net stresses, and finally sheared at constant water content or constant suction level by means of the axis translation technique or the vapour equilibrium technique. Finally, due to the importance of the static liquefaction phenomena in stability problems of tailing dams, a fourth series of experimental tests was performed by means of a triaxial cell. <b>Silt</b> specimens were <b>tested</b> in unsaturated or close to saturated conditions, in order to investigate some of the main factors (degree of saturation, initial density and preparation technique) that are supposed to influence the liquefaction response...|$|R
