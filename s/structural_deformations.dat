Twistor space is a three-dimensional complex projective space in which physical quantities appear as certain <b>structural</b> <b>deformations.</b> Spacetime and the familiar physical fields emerge as consequences of this description.

50|$|The {{hardness}} of {{a material}} {{is directly related}} to its incompressibility, elasticity and resistance to change in shape. A superhard material has high shear modulus, high bulk modulus and does not deform plastically. Ideally superhard materials should have a defect-free, isotropic lattice. This greatly reduces <b>structural</b> <b>deformations</b> that can lower the strength of the material. However, defects can actually strengthen some covalent structures. Traditionally, high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions have been used to synthesize superhard materials, but recent superhard material syntheses aim at using less energy and lower cost materials.|$|E

Furthermore, {{it is capable of}} concentrating substances with low molecular weights that are too small to be removed by a filtration membrane. Freeze-drying is a relatively expensive process. The equipment is about three times as expensive as the equipment used for other separation processes, and the high energy demands lead to high energy costs. Furthermore, freeze-drying also has a long process time, because the addition of too much heat to the material can cause melting or <b>structural</b> <b>deformations.</b> Therefore, freeze-drying is often reserved for materials that are heat-sensitive, such as proteins, enzymes, microorganisms, and blood plasma. The low operating temperature of the process leads to minimal damage of these heat-sensitive products.|$|E

5000|$|Type IIa {{diamonds}} make up 1-2% of {{all natural}} diamonds (1.8% of gem diamonds). These diamonds are almost or entirely devoid of impurities, and consequently are usually colourless {{and have the}} highest thermal conductivity. They are very transparent in ultraviolet, down to 230 nm. Occasionally, while Type IIa diamonds are being extruded towards {{the surface of the}} Earth, the pressure and tension can cause structural anomalies arising through plastic deformation during the growth of the tetrahedral crystal structure, leading to imperfections. These imperfections can confer a yellow, brown, orange, pink, red, or purple colour to the gem. Type IIa diamonds can have their <b>structural</b> <b>deformations</b> [...] "repaired" [...] via a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) process, removing much or all of the diamond's color.

What we find is that the original stick and spiral model is not appropriate to describe accurately the <b>structural</b> <b>deformations</b> of graphene in the elastic regime.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the accuracy, availability, {{reliability}} and integrity of GPS are dependent on the number of satellites in view and their distribution. As a consequence of the satellite constellation geometry, the vertical component of the 3 D coordinates is less accurate than that of the horizontal components.

The range influence of a vacancy defect due to <b>structural</b> <b>deformation</b> is characterized and a microscopic explanation is proposed to relate the <b>structural</b> <b>deformation</b> to the bandgap variation. In order to investigate {{the effect of the}} defect density on carbon nanotube, 5 models of (5, 5) armchair carbon nanotubes were built with the defect density as one vacancy per 79, 119, 159, 199 and 239 carbon atoms, respectively. The long range of influence of a MVD is characterized by <b>structural</b> <b>deformation</b> analysis and the strain caused by the MVD is the main reason to cause the strong fluctuation in bandgap of the defected armchair SWCNTs. However, no simple correlation between the MVD density and bandgap, are found.
