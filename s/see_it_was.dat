5|$|In {{addition}} to the four nationwide tours {{and all the other}} concerts, what little time remained was taken up with TV shows, press interviews, and recording sessions for the singles and albums released that year. The Beatles also had a weekly radio show. The music papers were full of stories about the Beatles, and magazines for teenage girls regularly contained interviews with the band members, colour posters and other Beatle-related articles. The intense public interest in the Beatles, coupled with Epstein's demanding schedule, ensured that they had no time for family matters. Lennon's August 1962 marriage to Cynthia Powell was kept from public view as a closely guarded secret. When Lennon's son Julian was born on 8 April 1963, Lennon, visiting the hospital to see his wife and meet his new son for the first time, attempted to disguise himself to prevent people in the hospital from recognising him. Lennon's attempt to keep the secret was not successful as other patients could <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> him. After the hospital visit, Epstein's schedule prevailed once more.|$|E
5|$|The Way I <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} by Columbia Records on September 16, 2008, and was initially overlooked by consumers.

It also performed well in European countries such as France, where it charted for 51 weeks. The Way I See It received generally positive reviews from critics and {{was seen as an}} exemplary release of the classic soul revival at the time. It also garnered Saadiq a newer, more diverse audience as he toured extensively in support of the album, performing concerts in the US, Europe, and Asia.|$|E

[...] Opinion was divided on Calvert's tactics: The Observers Legget claimed that Calvert [...] "adopted quite the wrong tactics", while Jim Railton of The Times suggested [...] "Calvert's move may well prove to be the future tactics of other crews behind but in contact at Hammersmith Bridge on the Middlesex station in similar conditions."

500|$|The Way I <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{engineered}} by Saadiq, Gerry Brown, James Tanksley, and Brungardt, who mixed the album with Saadiq. Saadiq and Brungardt both liked to layer multiple instruments and, prior to recording, had contemplated {{techniques such as}} sampling and drum programming. However, they ultimately found live instrumentalists more dynamic and challenged themselves to reproduce older music productions and the Motown aesthetic of the 1960s. To familiarize themselves with vintage recording techniques, they studied Mark Lewisohn's 1988 book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, books about Motown Records, and images of the label's studio personnel, setup of instruments, and microphone placement. They also studied Motown EQs to achieve a tone they found adequate for songs' rhythm guitar parts. Saadiq {{said that he had}} to disregard [...] "about 85 to 90 percent of the new techniques ... People used to take recording very seriously. They used to wear lab coats at Abbey Road. So I got serious with what I was trying to do, both mentally and physically." [...] Brungardt said in an interview for Mix that he abandoned the approach learned on previous records he had engineered, where [...] "they wanted it clean with no distortion. I was taught {{to make sure it was}} polish, polish, polish, and to make sure everything fits right, the bass hits and things are clean for the big pop vocal." ...|$|E
500|$|The Way I <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> largely {{overlooked}} by consumers upon its release. The album debuted at number 19 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 23,000 copies {{in the week}} of October 4. Nonetheless, it was Saadiq's highest-charting album in the United States at the time, and by November, had steadily sold 76,919 copies. Five singles were released from the album—"Love That Girl" [...] on August 5, 2008, [...] "100 Yard Dash" [...] on March 30, 2009, [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] on May 27, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] on August 7, and [...] "Staying in Love" [...] on October 5. [...] "Love That Girl", [...] "Never Give You Up", and [...] "Staying in Love" [...] all charted on the US Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs, peaking at number 45, number 26, and number 74, respectively. During 2009, Saadiq travelled for promotional television appearances and press in Europe, where The Way I See It had charted in several countries. In France, the record spent 51 weeks on the country's albums chart, peaking at number 13 in the week of February 24. In August, it re-entered the American chart at number 101 and had sold 215,000 copies. The album charted for 41 weeks on the Billboard 200, serving as the longest chart-run of Saadiq's career. By May 2011, it had sold 282,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E

500|$|The Way I <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> an {{exemplary}} {{release of the}} classic soul revival during its peak in 2008. The music scene was marked by similarly retro-minded work from mainstream artists such as Amy Winehouse and Adele, independent acts such as Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings and Mayer Hawthorne, and older artists attempting comebacks such as Al Green and Bettye LaVette. Oliver Wang cited Saadiq's album, along with Solange Knowles' 2008 record Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, {{as one of the}} [...] "retro-soul" [...] efforts that were released by contemporary R artists as the music scene peaked in popularity. Wang wrote that The Way I See It [...] "showcased a mastery of any number of past R styles, including those out of Memphis, Muscle Shoals, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and of course, Detroit." [...] Estelle said in 2008, [...] "Every song is like a different era of Motown ... Everything sounds exactly like it did back in the day. Not to take away from Amy, but this is the real shit." [...] It was described by David Nathan as the [...] "contemporary album that was the closest to authentically recreating the great soul music sound of the late '60s and early '70s." [...] Ken Tucker found it distinct from other soul revival music: [...] "You can reproduce variations on melodies and rhythm, but without an emotional commitment, it's all tedious pandering to baby boomers. For Raphael Saadiq, there's a glowing vibrancy in soul music that allows him to work out themes and ideas." ...|$|E
