40|$|At a {{time when}} {{resources}} for HIV/AIDS prevention in most countries are stretched painfully thin, the paper by Wood et al. 1 helps address the quintessential {{question of how to}} target those most at risk. In the late 1990 s, reports of the Vancouver HIV outbreak among injection drug users (IDUs) documented one of the highest HIV incidence rates in the western hemisphere, peaking at nearly 20 per 100 person years. 2 The causal and non-causal factors surrounding this outbreak {{have been the subject of}} much debate. 3 In a city that was home to the highest volume fixed-site <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> (SEP) and where HIV prevalence had remained low and stable since 1988, what went wrong?

40|$|Background: Heroin {{dependence}} {{is associated}} with high mortality. Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine has strong evidence for treatment of this relapsing condition. In our setting, OAT {{has been associated with}} strict and demanding intake procedures, often with requirements of social stability, but also high, approximately 80 percent 12 -month retention rates. In a recent randomized controlled trial, we demonstrated high rates of successful rapid referral from a <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> (SEP) to treatment with methadone or buprenorphine, including actual treatment initiation. The objectives of this study were to assess 12 -month retention rates, in order to assess whether a novel referral program of current drug users at a SEP would achieve retention rates comparable to more traditional intake procedures. Methods: The present report is a 12 -month follow-up of 71 patients who successfully started treatment with methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone. Patient data from baseline and at 12 months were collected. results: Out of the 71 patients who started treatment, 58 (82 %) were still in treatment after 12 months. conclusion: This was a population, referred from a SEP, with a high drug use severity on admission and no pretreatment requirement for social stability, but there were still high retention rates at 12 months comparable to regular opioid agonist clinics in our setting...|$|E
40|$|Setting: Needle and <b>Syringe</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Programme</b> (NSEP) {{implemented}} by non-governmental organisations in Malaysia. Objectives: To determine enrolment, characteristics and retention in the NSEP {{of people who}} inject drugs (PWID) between 2013 and 2015. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Results: There were 20 946 PWID, {{with a mean age}} of 38 years. The majority were male (98 %) and of Malay ethnicity (92 %). Follow-up data were available for 20 761 PWID. Annual retention of newly enrolled PWID for each year was respectively 85 %, 87 % and 78 % for 2013, 2014 and 2015, although annual enrolment over these years declined from 10 724 to 6288 to 3749. Total person-years (py) of follow-up were 27 806, with loss to follow-up of 40 per 100 py. Cumulative probability of retention in NSEP was 66 % at 12 months, 45 % at 24 months and 26 % at 36 months. Significantly higher loss to follow-up rates were observed in those aged 15 – 24 years or  50 years, females, transgender people and non-Malay ethnic groups. Conclusion: Annual retention of new PWID on NSEP was impressive, although enrolment declined over the 3 years of the study and cumulative loss to follow-up was high.

40|$|Harm {{reduction}} is {{an approach that}} aims to reduce harms related to using drugs. Harm reduction services often fail to consider the needs of women who inject drugs or minimise responses to women’s needs in service design and implementation (Bennett et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2005; EMCDDA, 2006; Levy, 2014 a; Pinkham, Stoicesu and Myers, 2012; UNODC et al., 2014). It is therefore crucial to understand the experiences of women who inject drugs from their own perspectives, {{as well as those}} of harm reduction workers, in order to develop and implement effective responses to injecting drug use. This thesis explores how ‘harm’ and ‘harm reduction’ are conceptualised by workers and clients at a women-only day <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programme.</b> It answers the following questions: In what ways do participants’ broader understandings of ‘harm’ and ‘harm reduction’ go beyond the traditional public health model of harm reduction in response to illicit injectable drug use? How are clients and workers’ understandings gendered? These questions were explored empirically through fieldwork in 2013 and 2014 at a harm reduction centre which featured a women-only day <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> in Budapest, Hungary. This women-only day was the only gender sensitive harm reduction programme in the country, and the first study undertaken with Roma women who inject drugs in Hungary and female harm reduction workers. In addition, this first research project to use photovoice within a harm reduction context in Hungary. Data were co-produced with respondents according to the principles of Feminist- informed Participatory Action Research, using the method of ‘photovoice’. This method involved providing cameras for clients and employees of the women-only day to photograph their experiences and understandings of harm, harm production, and harm reduction. A significant portion of the data collected for this study was created by female harm reduction workers who worked at the women-only <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programme.</b> Employees and clients’ images guided the research observations, interviews, and analysis. This meant collaboration between the participants and the researcher through the fieldwork, including the development and implementation of a research output in the form of a public photo exhibition and fundraiser event. The event was called ‘Chicks on the Corner’, and is the source of the thesis title as well as the title of the research project. The theoretical frameworks of zemiology (the study of harm) and black and multiracial feminist thought informed the ontological and epistemological grounding of the Chicks on the Corner project. These frameworks, coupled with the empirical data, produced an argument for the development of a feminist zemiology. The analytical themes that emerged from the Chicks on the Corner project were produced and categorised primarily using participant generated photographs. These images depict the multiple intersecting, overlapping, and mutually reinforcing sources of harm production and attempts at harm reduction in participants’ lives. Analysis of the photographs affirm that women who inject drugs experience an array of harms in addition to physical harms related to their drug use. Harms identified by research participants were categorised using Hillyard and Tombs (2004; 2005) zemiological typology. This typology consists of: physical harms, emotional harms, economic harms, and cultural harms (also known as lack of cultural safety). In addition, a new fifth category of harm was created based on participants’ responses, and is called institutional and political harms. The data from the Chicks on the Corner project show how institutional and political harms contributed to the production of the other four categories of harm. Furthermore, the analysis outlines the numerous challenges workers faced in attempting to provide adequate harm reduction responses while experiencing multiple social harms as well. These novel findings suggest the need for expanded definitions of ‘harm’ in harm reduction theory and practices. The findings from the Chicks on the Corner project complement existing literature on harm reduction theory and practice while also adding to the limited body of research on gender- sensitive approaches to harm reduction. This thesis contributes to an expansion of theoretical understandings of harm and harm reduction in relation to women who inject drugs and harm reduction workers, as well as discussing implications for gender sensitive harm reduction practices. Based on this analysis, I propose the development of feminist zemiology as a way to better understanding harm...|$|E
40|$|Intravenous {{drug use}} is a major {{international}} health problem. The transmission of HIV through sharing syringes or needles during {{drug use is}} an important part of this problem. Injection drug users (IDUs) also engage in high-risk sexual behaviour which facilitates the transmission between different groups. In this article, we present a global perspective of injection drug use in relation to HIV. There are 16 million IDUs worldwide, of whom an estimated 3 million are infected with HIV. The prevalence of HIV among IDUs varies greatly between countries as well as within them. There are intervention programmes to prevent HIV transmission via drug use such as needle and <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> (NSPs) and opioid substitution therapy (OST). These programmes are effective for preventing HIV transmission, provided that their implementation is adequate. 80 % of the countries provide NSPs, 65 % also provide OST.

40|$|In Malaysia the {{response}} to illicit drug use has been largely punitive with the current goal of the Malaysian government being to achieve a drug-free society by 2015. This paper outlines {{the results of a}} desk-based situation assessment conducted over a 3 -week period in 2004. Additional events, examined in 2005, were also included to describe more recent policy developments and examine how these came about. Despite punitive drug policy there has been a substantial {{rise in the number of}} drug users in the country. Over two-thirds of HIV/AIDS cases are among injecting drug users (IDUs) and there has been an exponential rise in the number of cases reported. Further, data suggest high risk drug use practices are widespread. Harm reduction initiatives have only recently been introduced in Malaysia. The successful piloting of substitution therapies, in particular methadone and buprenorphine, is cause for genuine hope for the rapid development of such interventions. In 2005 the government announced it will allow methadone maintenance programmes to operate beyond the pilot phase and needle and <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> will be established to serve the needs of IDUs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To study {{risk factors}} for {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection in injecting drug users (IDUs) from central Sydney. SETTING AND SUBJECTS [...] All IDUs attending a primary health care facility in central Sydney between December 1991 and November 1992 who underwent HCV antibody testing. METHODS [...] Information was obtained retrospectively from client forms routinely completed {{at the time of}} medical consultation. Additional information on injecting history and practice was obtained from the registration forms of subjects who also attended the needle <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> at the same health care facility. RESULTS [...] Of the 201 IDUs tested, 118 (59 %) had HCV antibodies, which did not differ significantly between males and females. HCV prevalence increased significantly with age, being highest in IDUs who were aged 35 years or more (93 %) and lowest in IDUs aged under 20 years (17 %). HCV prevalence increased significantly with time since first injecting, from 26 % for IDUs who had injected for less than 3 years to 94 % for those who had injected for more than 10 years. HCV prevalence was also significantly higher in heterosexual IDUs as compared with homosexual male IDUs, and in opiate users as compared with stimulant users, even after adjustment for age and duration of injecting. HCV prevalence was strongly associated with exposure to hepatitis B virus, but was not associated with exposure to HIV. CONCLUSION [...] Recent HCV transmission indicates ongoing injecting risk behaviour despite HIV prevention efforts, and underlies the potential for increased transmission of HIV through the sharing of injecting equipment. Within the population of IDUs, those who are heterosexual or inject heroin appear to be at increased risk of HCV infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of a harm reduction approach for drug users has prompted extensive debate in many countries. However, in Malaysia the pertinent issues regarding the bases of such an approach and its consonance with the criminal justice approach have received little attention. This thesis examines the justifications for the harm reduction approach in Malaysia, its compatibility with the existing criminal justice approach and ways of reconciling both approaches {{in the event of}} conflicts between them within a socio-legal sphere of analysis. Building on philosophical and scientific judgements, this thesis argues that Malaysia should implement the harm reduction approach and argues that it is congruent with public health ethics, utilitarianism, human rights protection and the Islamic principles of ‘hajiyyat’ (needs), ‘darurah’ (necessity) and ‘al-∂arar al-ashaddyuzalu bi’l-∂arar al-akhaff’(tolerating a lesser harm to eliminate a greater one). The approach also fits in with the abstinence orientation adopted within drug prohibition policy and the confines of the international drug control conventions. The Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT) and Needle and <b>Syringe</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Programme</b> (NSEP) harm reduction measures are further justified by their efficacy and cost-effectiveness in decreasing drug use and HIV pathogen transmission. This thesis also argues that any alleged unintended adverse consequences of harm reduction are limited or absental together. Moreover, with regard to the issue of compatibility between the harm reduction and criminal justice approaches, this thesis emphasises that there are significant theoretical and practical conflicts between the two approaches as they are currently understood and practised in Malaysia. The tensions arises principally from law enforcement practices, predominantly the street-level policing activities, reflecting the lack of commitment of criminal justice actors to the harm reduction strategy, despite the existence of government initiatives to support harm reduction. The thesis suggests important options for reconciling both approaches, particularly at a conceptual level. Finally, this thesis argues for incorporating the harm reduction approach as an important component of overall drug policy under a sustained prohibitionist framework...|$|E

The study {{describes}} practices {{relating to}} syringe acquisition and disposal by <b>Syringe</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Programme</b> (SEP) participants. A crosssectional multi-city study enrolled 857 {{injection drug users}} (IDUs) from six SEPs in different Brazilian regions, and assessed self-reported acquisition and disposal behaviours. Seven hundred and nine males (82. 9 %) and 146 females (17. 1 %) were recruited through outreach and interviewed, most from the streets or their neighbourhoods (54. 1 %). The average age was 28. 5 years; 76. 4 % reported injecting cocaine in the past 6 months. Sources for acquiring new syringes differed significantly between time of injection drug use debut and the 6 months prior to interview. Fifty-three percent of IDUs reported acquiring their syringes in pharmacies when they initiated injection drug use, whereas most reported acquiring new syringes in the 6 months before interview from several simultaneous sources: 69 % through SEPs; 58 % through pharmacies; 36 % from friends and/or sexual partners; and 17 % from other health services. Across SEPs, acquisition and disposal varied widely. Most interviewees discarded their syringes on the streets, in open fields, or in the garbage or sewage. Restrictions on syringe availability and unsafe practices may be functioning as barriers to the public health recommendation of one-time use of sterile syringes for IDUs and discouraging community support to SEPs. Further increase in access to legal, inexpensive and timely sterile syringes, as well as counselling about the merits of one-time use and safer disposal must be reinforced as part of efforts to minimise high-risk behaviours and curb the spread of blood-borne infections...|$|E
40|$|Injecting {{drug users}} (IDUs) are {{vulnerable}} {{to a wide range}} of viral and bacterial infections through poor injection hygiene. These infections, which include HIV, hepatitis C and hepatitis B, result in considerable levels of morbidity and mortality. With an estimated 750, 000 to 1 million active IDUs in the European Union (EU), these infections have the potential to place a considerable burden on European healthcare systems, as well as adversely impacting on the well-being of those who inject drugs. Interventions have been adopted throughout Europe that aim to reduce risk of these infections; these interventions include opiate substitution therapy (OST) and needle and <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> (NSPs), both of which have been shown to effective in preventing infections. They aim to reduce infections by changing the behaviours that place individuals at risk of infection, such as through reducing the sharing and reuse of injecting equipment and by decreasing the frequency of drug injection. Monitoring the levels of these behaviours is thus important for assessing the impact of intervention programmes. The systematic collection of information on risk and protective behaviours is therefore an important part of second-generation HIV surveillance systems. Behavioural surveillance focused on IDUs often looks at behaviours related to a range of viral infections of the blood, not just HIV, due to the similarities in the routes of transmission...|$|R
40|$|Although a {{large body}} of {{international}} literature has found <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> (SEPs) to be associated with reduced incidence of blood borne pathogens among injection drug users, recent studies have fuelled controversy surrounding SEP effectiveness. Existing studies are observational in nature and have seldom considered ecologic aspects affecting SEP functioning and evaluation. The authors apply concepts from infectious disease epidemiology to discuss the direct and indirect effects of SEP upon the spread of blood borne pathogens in drug users, their social networks and the broader community. Further, the authors discuss social policies, particularly drug control policies, which have directly and/or indirectly limited SEP functioning at local and national levels. A critical review of the literature suggests that biases common to observational studies can account for higher HIV incidence among SEP attenders relative to non-attenders. Strong selection factors often lead high-risk drug users to be over-represented among SEP attenders. Failure to account for these factors and the indirect effects of SEPs can bias interpretations of programme effectiveness. Future SEP evaluations should consider behavioural data, the local ethnographic context, the prevalence of infectious disease in the groups under study and the structural components of SEP that are most and least effective at reducing incidence of blood borne pathogens. Hierarchical models that take into account the ecological dimensions of SEP are recommended as an approach for future studies. Beyond methodologic concerns, the authors discuss social, legal and programmatic obstacles that must be overcome in order to maximise SEP effectiveness.

40|$|Background: Compared to {{the general}} population, drug users are at {{increased}} risk of both poor mental health and HIV infection. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence and correlates of high psychological distress among drug users in Cambodia. Methods: In April 2014, a two-stage cluster sampling method was used to randomly select 169 drug users from hotspots in Phnom Penh. Psychological distress was measured using General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12). Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with levels of psychological distress among this population. Results: Our study found high prevalence of attempted suicide (15. 3 %), drug related arrests (46. 2 %), and incarceration (31. 4 %). Of the 169 participants, 42. 0 % were found to have high levels of psychological distress, indicating poor mental health. After adjustment, high levels of psychological distress were independently associated with suicidal ideation (p< 0. 001), higher frequency of drug use (p= 0. 02), sharing of needles or syringes (p= 0. 005), and having been sent to a rehabilitation centre (p= 0. 02). In addition, participants who perceived their overall health as being poor or very poor were more likely to have high levels of psychological distress (p= 0. 002). Conclusions: Integration of mental health within HIV and needle and <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> is required to address psychological distress among drug users in Cambodia. Health system interventions, such as screening, referral, and training of health providers, need to be strengthened.

This {{study examines}} {{the occurrence of}} user influence during {{the implementation of the}} first Needle and <b>Syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>Programme</b> (NSP) in Stockholm County. The survey in his study consists of interviews conducted with persons that have been involved during the process and debate around the NSP in Stockholm County. The interviews have been conducted with two different groups of actors: User organizations and public actors. The first group called user organizations consists of actors from three different user organizations representing and organizing the target group for the NSP. The second group called public actors consists of public actors which have been involved under and/or before the implementation of the NSP in Stockholm County. The study contains a description of the background of NSPs in Sweden. The study describes the development of the Swedish drug policy from 1970 until today. Further it covers the development of the NSPs in other parts of Sweden as well as the development of harm reduction as a general strategy for drug addiction management. Several definitions to the terms user and user influence are presented. Four are conventional definitions of the term user, together with a fifth one which is then used within {{in the context of the}} study. The study presents definitions of the term user influence by a model dividing user influence in three categories: individual level, operational level and system level. Another division of the term user influence presented is formalized and non-formalized user influence. These different classifications are used in the analysis of the results. The study also presents a background to the governance view on user influence as a natural and unproblematic part in the policy process. The theoretical framework in the study consists of two parts: The first part questions governance and the given of user influence within a policy process. The study highlights the problems with a governance view on actorhood and user influence. The second part of the theory chapter presents a model for the policy process. The policy process is described in five stages: Initiation, processing, decision making, implementation and evaluation. The results of the survey show little occurrence of user influence during the implementation of the NSP. By using the classification with the three different levels of user influence the result is that the occurrence of user influence found in the investigation has the characteristics of individual level user influence. The study also shows that the user influence found can be classified as non-formalised influence. The analysis first discusses the factors of why there has been little occurrence of user influence during the implementation of the NSP and proposes three different plausible explanations: Politically sensitive question, structural difficulties and users view was already known. The analysis also discuss the problem with a governance view on actorhood and user influence in relation to the study. The study concludes that there has been little occurrence of user influence during the implementation of the NSP in Stockholm County and that the occurrence of user influence found can be classified as individual level user influence, with one plausible exception...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In 2003, {{it became}} legal in the UK for <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> (SEPs) to provide citrate to injecting drug users to {{solubilise}} heroin. Little {{work has been}} undertaken {{on the effect of}} policy change on SEP function. Here, we examine whether the introduction of citrate in Cheshire and Merseyside SEPs has altered the number of heroin/crack injectors accessing SEPs, the frequency at which heroin/crack injectors visited SEPs and the number of syringes dispensed. Methods Eleven SEPs in Cheshire and Merseyside commenced citrate provision in 2003. SEP-specific data for the six months before and six months after citrate was introduced were extracted from routine monitoring systems relating to heroin and crack injectors. Analyses compared all individuals attending pre and post citrate and matched analyses only those individuals attending in both periods (defined as 'longitudinal attenders'). Non-parametric tests were used throughout. Results Neither new (first seen in either six months period) nor established clients visited SEPs more frequently post citrate. New clients collected significantly less syringes per visit post citrate, than pre citrate (14. 5, 10. 0; z = 1. 992, P Conclusion The introduction of citrate did not negatively affect SEP attendance. 'Longitudinal attenders' visited SEPs more frequently post citrate, providing staff with greater opportunity for intervention and referral. As the number of syringes they collected each visit remained unchanged the total number of clean syringes made available to this group of injectors increased very slightly between the pre and post citrate periods. However, new clients collected significantly less syringes post citrate than pre citrate, possibly due to staff concerns regarding the amount of citrate (and thus syringes) to dispense safely to new clients. These concerns {{should not be allowed to}} negatively impact on the number of syringes dispensed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the high}} number of injecting drug users (IDUs) in Estonia, little is known about {{involving}} pharmacies into human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention activities and potential barriers. Similarly, in other Eastern European countries, {{there is a need for}} additional sources for clean <b>syringes</b> besides <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> (SEPs), but data on current practices relating to pharmacists’ role in harm reduction strategies is scant. Involving pharmacies is especially important for several reasons: they have extended hours of operation and convenient locations compared to SEPs, may provide access for IDUs who have avoided SEPs, and are a trusted health resource in the community. We conducted a series of focus groups with pharmacists and IDUs in Tallinn, Estonia, to explore their attitudes toward the role of pharmacists in HIV prevention activities for IDUs. Many, but not all, pharmacists reported a readiness to sell syringes to IDUs to help prevent HIV transmission. However, negative attitudes toward IDUs in general and syringe sales to them specifically were identified as important factors restricting such sales. The idea of free distribution of clean syringes or other injecting equipment and disposal of used syringes in pharmacies elicited strong resistance. IDUs stated that pharmacies were convenient for acquiring syringes due to their extended opening hours and local distribution. IDUs were positive toward pharmacies, although they were aware of stigma from pharmacists and other customers. They also emphasized the need for distilled water and other injection paraphernalia. In conclusion, there are no formal or legislative obstacles for providing HIV prevention services for IDUs at pharmacies. Addressing negative attitudes through educational courses and involving pharmacists willing to be public health educators in high drug use areas would improve access for HIV prevention services for IDUs...|$|R

Failure to account for these factors and the indirect e ects of SEPs can bias interpretations of programme e ectiveness. Future SEP evaluations should consider behavioural data, the local ethnographic context, the prevalence of infectious disease in the groups under study and the structural components of SEP that are most and least e ective at reducing incidence of blood borne pathogens. Hierarchical models that take into account the ecological dimensions of SEP are recommended as an approach for future studies. Beyond methodologic concerns, the authors discuss social, legal and programmatic obstacles that must be overcome in order to maximise SEP e ectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Sharing drug injecting {{paraphernalia}} {{other than}} needles and syringes (N/S) has {{been implicated in}} the transmission of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) among injecting drug users (IDU). We aimed {{to determine whether the}} provision of sterile non-N/S injecting paraphernalia reduces injecting risk behaviours or HCV transmission among IDU. Methods A systematic search of seven databases and the grey literature for articles published January 1989 -February 2010 was undertaken. Thirteen studies (twelve observational and one non-randomized uncontrolled pilot intervention) were identified and appraised for study design and quality by two investigators. Results No studies examined the association between the provision of non-N/S injecting paraphernalia and incident HCV infection. One cross-sectional study found that individuals who frequently, compared to those who infrequently, used sterile cookers and water, were less likely to report prevalent HCV infection. Another found no association between the uptake of sterile non-N/S injecting paraphernalia and self-reported sharing of this paraphernalia. The remaining observational studies used attendance at needle and <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> (NSP) or safer injection facilities (SIF) that provided non-N/S injecting paraphernalia as a proxy measure. Eight studies presented adjusted odds ratios, ranging from 0. 3 to 0. 9, suggesting a reduced likelihood of self-reported sharing of non-N/S injecting paraphernalia associated with use of NSP or SIF. There was substantial uncertainty associated with these estimates however. Three unadjusted studies reported a reduction in the prevalence of sharing of non-N/S injecting paraphernalia over time among NSP users. Only one study reported an adjusted temporal trend in the prevalence of sharing non-N/S injecting paraphernalia, finding higher rates among non-NSP users than NSP users at each time point, and a greater reduction in sharing among non-NSP than NSP users over time. Study limitations included the use of convenience samples, self-reported exposure and outcome measures, flawed classification of the exposed and unexposed groups, and inadequate adjustment for potential confounding variables. Conclusions The evidence to demonstrate that the provision of sterile non-N/S injecting paraphernalia reduces HCV transmission or modifies injecting risk behaviours is currently limited by an insufficient volume and quality of studies. Further research is required to inform practice and policy in this area. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This paper {{provides}} 1996 {{information on}} the status of US <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs and compares these findings with data from our 1994 survey. METHODS: In November 1996, questionnaires were mailed to 101 <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs. Program directors were contacted to conduct telephone interviews based on the mailed questionnaires. Data collected included number of <b>syringes</b> <b>exchanged,</b> <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> program operations, legal status, and services offered. RESULTS: Eighty-seven programs participated in the survey. A total of 46 (53 %) were legal, 20 (23 %) were illegal but tolerated, and 21 (24 %) were illegal-underground. Since 1994, there has been a 54 % {{increase in the number of}} cities and a 38 % increase in the number of states with <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs. Eighty-four programs reported exchanging approximately 14 million syringes, a 75 % increase from 1994. <b>Syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs also provided a variety of other services and supplies, and legal programs were more likely than illegal ones to provide these services. CONCLUSION: Despite continued lack of federal funding, <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs expanded in terms of the number of <b>syringes</b> <b>exchanged,</b> the geographic distribution of programs, and the range of services offered...|$|R
40|$|One {{third of}} all cases of the {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States {{are associated with the}} injection of illicit drugs. There is mounting evidence for the effectiveness of <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs in reducing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behavior and HIV transmission among injection drug users. Expansion of <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> would require increased public funding and undoubtedly would include government regulation of <b>syringe</b> <b>exchanges.</b> An analogy is drawn with the present system of regulation of methadone maintenance treatment programs and possible regulation of <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs. Specific recommendations are offered to reduce the likelihood of repeating the regulatory problems of methadone maintenance treatment in future regulation of <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES. This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} the strategies used by <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs to establish their legality. METHODS. Statutes, court decisions, published studies of exchange programs, and news stories were reviewed, and telephone {{interviews were conducted with}} <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> personnel. RESULTS. Twenty-seven exchanges have been authorized by amendments to or judicial interpretations of state drug laws or by administrative action under such laws, or operate in a state that has no laws regulating needles. At least 13 programs operate under claims of legality based on local interpretations of state law, principally public health law. The remaining <b>syringe</b> <b>exchanges</b> operate without a claim of legality. CONCLUSIONS. The deployment of <b>syringe</b> <b>exchanges</b> has been hindered by concerns about their legal status. This study shows that the applicability of drug laws to <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> is open to dispute, and that local public health authorities may under some circumstances rely on their own legal authority to fund or operate <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. We {{studied the}} effect of local {{approval}} of <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs in California (through Assembly AB 136) on program availability and performance. Methods. We determined the number of active <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs in California by conducting Internet searches and obtaining information {{from the state and}} from local programs. To track changes in program availability and performance between 2000 and 2002, we interviewed 24 program directors an-nually for 3 years about program characteristics, <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> policies, law enforcement contact, and other issues. We conducted multivariate analy-ses to determine whether AB 136 approval status was associated with changes in performance. Results. Fifteen local governments (13 counties and 2 cities) enacted the new law by 2002, and operating <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs increased from 24 to 35. The proportion of these programs that were not locally approved declined from 54 % to 40 %. No new approved programs were started in high-need counties.

40|$|This work {{examines}} hepatitis C among {{injection drug}} users in the United States. Injection drug users are particularly vulnerable to hepatitis C infection because of the efficiency of viral transmission through blood-to-blood contact. I assert that <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs, which have been an otherwise highly effective public health intervention, must do more to reduce the burden of hepatitis C on {{injection drug users}}. While <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs have been successful at reducing the transmission of HIV through encouraging injection drug users to abstain from sharing needles, hepatitis C continues to spread among injection drug users. Original research conducted at Prevention Point of Philadelphia, Philadelphia’s only <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> program, attempted to determine routes of transmission driving the continuing epidemic of hepatitis C among injection drug users. This research also demonstrated that hepatitis C knowledge in the injection drug using community is incomplete, indicating the need for <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs to make education about hepatitis C more available to injection drug users. Through {{an examination of the}} relationship between hepatitis C, injection drug users, and <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs, this thesis argues that <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs are uniquely poised to make a significant contribution to the eradication of hepatitis C and the protection of the health of injection drug users...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{trace the}} growth of <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> {{programs}} (SEPs) in the United States since 1994 – 95 and assess {{the current state of}} SEPs. Methods Annual surveys of US SEPs known to North American <b>Syringe</b> <b>Exchange</b> Network (NASEN). Surveys mailed to executive directors with follow-up interviews by telephone and/or e-mail. Response rates have varied between 70 % and 88 % since surveys were initiated in 1996. Results The numbers of programs known to NASEN have increased from 68 in 1994 – 95 to 186 in 2007. Among programs participating in the survey, numbers of <b>syringes</b> <b>exchanged</b> have increased from 8. 0 million per year to 29. 5 million per year, total annual budgets have increased from $ 6. 3 to $ 19. 6 million and public funding (from state and local governments) has increased from $ 3. 9 to $ 14. 4 million. In 2007, 89 % of programs permitted secondary exchange and 76 % encouraged it. Condoms, referrals to substance abuse treatment, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) counseling and testing and naloxone for overdose were among the most commonly provided services in addition to basic <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange.</b> Each of these services was provided by 40 % or more of SEPs in 2007. Conclusions While <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> has remained controversial in the United States, there has been very substantial growth in numbers of programs, <b>syringes</b> <b>exchange</b> and program budgets. Utilizing secondary exchange to reach large numbers of inject-ing drug users and utilizing SEPs as a new platform for providing health and social services beyond basic <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> have been the two major organizational strategies in {{the growth of}} SEPs in the United States...|$|R

40|$|Background—Injection {{drug users}} (IDUs) {{are at high}} risk of {{hepatitis}} B (HBV) infection, and HBV vaccination coverage in IDUs is low. Recent studies demonstrate that <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs are effective venues to reach and immunize IDUs. The purpose of this paper was to determine if targeting IDUs for HBV vaccination through <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs is economically desirable for the healthcare system and to assess the relative effectiveness of several different vaccination strategies. Methods—Active IDUs in Chicago IL and Hartford and Bridgeport CT (N= 1964) were recruited and screened through local <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs, randomized to a standard (0, 1, 6 months) or accelerated (0, 1, 2 months) vaccination schedule, and followed from May 2003 to March 2006. Analyses were conducted in 2007. The vaccination program’s costs were balanced against future HBV-associated medical costs. Benefits in terms of prevented acute HBV infections and quality-adjusted life years were estimated based on a Markov model. Results—HBV vaccination campaigns targeting IDUs through <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs are cost-saving. The most cost-saving strategies include giving the first dose to everyone at screening, administering the vaccination under the accelerated schedule (0, 1, 2 months), and obtaining highly discounted vaccine from local health departments. Conclusions—It is economically inappropriate to offer HBV screening in the absence of vaccination. Existing <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs in the U. S. should include HBV vaccination...|$|R
40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{prevention}} of human immunodeficiency virus infection, factors related to regular participation in the Amsterdam <b>Syringe</b> <b>Exchange</b> and the borrowing of syringes were studied in 131 HIV-seronegative injecting drug users in a 1989 - 90 survey. A total of 29 percent of the users reported borrowing syringes, that is injecting drugs {{at least once in}} the past 4 - 6 months with a needle or syringe previously used by someone else. Users at increased risk of borrowing are previous borrowers, long term moderate-to-heavy alcohol users, current cocaine injectors, and drug users without permanent housing. Regular clients of the <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange,</b> when compared with other injecting drug users, were found more often to be frequent, long term injectors. They borrowed slightly less often than other users, but this was not statistically significant, even after controlling for frequency of injecting or other potential confounders. The results suggest that, 5 years after the start of the Amsterdam <b>Syringe</b> <b>Exchange,</b> drug use characteristics govern an individual injecting drug user's choice of exchanging or not <b>exchanging</b> <b>syringes.</b> The conclusion is that it seems more important to direct additional preventive measures at injecting drug users with an increased risk of borrowing rather than at users who do not participate in the <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> or who do so irregularl...|$|R
