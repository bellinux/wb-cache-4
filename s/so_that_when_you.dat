500|$|No {{specific}} {{details of the}} workings of the claimed technology were made public. McCarthy stated in a 2006 RTÉ radio interview, [...] "What we have developed is a way to construct magnetic fields <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> travel round the magnetic fields, starting and stopping at the same position, you have gained energy". In 2011, Steorn's website was updated to suggest that the Orbo is based on magnetic fields which vary over time. Barry Williams of the Australian Skeptics has pointed out that Steorn is [...] "not the first company to claim they have suddenly discovered the miraculous property of magnetism that allows you to get free energy" [...] while Martin Fleischmann says that it is not credible that positioning of magnetic fields could create energy.|$|E
2500|$|Motion capture {{was used}} to capture the {{character}} animations in the game. LucasFilm partner Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) generated the animation. The size of each character presented issues during development and developers had {{to find ways to}} adjust the moves, based on the opponent. For example: Chewbacca will throw lower punches when fighting Princess Leia. Each character averaged around 1,200 polygons, roughly twice the count of similar fighting games. In developing the button combo system the staff wanted buttons to have context with the character's movements. [...] "We want to make it <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> hit the left button, you really hit with your left arm combo." ...|$|E
2500|$|Research in 2011 by Ropars et al., {{confirms}} {{that one can}} identify {{the direction of the}} sun to within a few degrees in both cloudy and twilight conditions using the sunstone and the naked eye. [...] The process involves moving the stone across the visual field to reveal a yellow entoptic pattern on the fovea of the eye. Alternatively a dot can be placed on top of crystal <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> look at it from below, two dots appear, because the light is “depolarised” and fractured along different axes. The crystal can then be rotated until the two points have the same luminosity. The angle of the top face now gives the direction of the sun. Attempts to replicate this work in both Scotland and off the coast of Turkey by science journalist Matt Kaplan and mineralogists at The British Geological Survey in 2014 failed. Kaplan communicated extensively with Ropars and neither could understand why the samples of Iceland spar that were being used during the trials did not reveal the sun's direction.|$|E

2500|$|Corry was {{a staunch}} {{advocate}} of Irish republicanism, strongly opposed to Partition, antipathetic to the United Kingdom, and sometimes bluntly outspoken within the Dáil chamber. In 1928, he criticised the Cumann na nGaedheal government's expenditure on the diplomatic corps, stating [...] "These salaries of £1,500 {{have to be}} paid so that they might squat like the nigger when he put on the black silk hat and the swallow-tail coat and went out and said he was an English gentleman." [...] His opposition to the Blueshirts in the early 1930s provoked an attempt to burn down his house. In the 1938 debate on the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement which ceded the Treaty Ports to the Irish state, Corry expressed regret that Northern Ireland remained excluded, suggesting [...] "I personally am in favour of storing up sufficient poison gas, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get the wind in the right direction you can start at the Border and let it travel, and follow it." [...] In a 1942 debate on exporting food to Great Britain during World War II, Corry remarked about food shortages there that [...] "They have no more rabbits to get, and now they are on the crows", and [...] "I would not like to see too many crows going out to feed them. I think the crows are too good for them". Patrick Giles called Corry a [...] "", and Alfie Byrne persisted in demanding an apology for the [...] "unchristian" [...] comments to the point of himself being suspended from the chamber.|$|E

5000|$|In 1950, Harmon Dobson and Paul Burton {{were looking}} to open a {{hamburger}} restaurant. Dobson's goal was to [...] "make a better burger that took two hands to hold and tasted <b>so</b> good <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> took a bite you would say 'What a burger!'" [...] In June 1950, Dobson was granted the Whataburger trademark. In August of that year they opened their first location on Ayers Street in Corpus Christi, Texas, across from Del Mar College. The store sold burgers for 25 cents, and also sold drinks and chips.|$|R

5000|$|In a {{contemporary}} review of Blue Bell Knoll, Victoria Thieberger of The Age appraised it as [...] "everything that atmospheric music {{should be and}} usually isn't". NME also viewed Blue Bell Knoll positively, placing it at number 33 for Albums of the Year 1988. A less favourable response came from Robert Christgau, who criticized the [...] "momentary momentum" [...] of the record's guitar playing, and highlighted its supposedly boring nature: [...] "Ever hear the one about being <b>so</b> open-minded <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> lay down to sleep your brains fall out?" ...|$|R
500|$|Taborn has {{commented on}} the {{similarities}} and differences in his playing on piano and electronic instruments. Comparing his accompaniments on piano and Fender Rhodes, he said that: I play some of the same chords on the piano, but there are definitely things I would do on the piano because it's a more transparent instrument that I wouldn't do on the Rhodes. [...] The Rhodes is <b>so</b> strong <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> play something on it, it really can dictate, because it's louder and the timbre is much more opaque. So you leave more holes. On the piano, I would maybe play more sustain chords.|$|R
60|$|On {{the grave}} of the Prince's father grew a rose-tree, a very {{beautiful}} rose-tree. It only bloomed every five years, and then bore but a single rose, but oh, such a rose! Its scent was <b>so</b> sweet <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> smelt it you forgot all your cares and troubles. And he had also a nightingale which could sing {{as if all the}} beautiful melodies in the world were shut up in its little throat. This rose and this nightingale the Princess was to have, and so they were both put into silver caskets and sent to her.|$|R

5000|$|... "The {{only reason}} we were being cool and calling it an 'indefinite hiatus' is because that's what this dork {{at the head of}} our record label was telling us. <b>So</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> find out <b>that</b> {{everyone}} was conspiring against you," [...] Barker recalled. Schur had announced the formation of his own imprint, Suretone Records, in March and released We Don't Need To Whisper, the debut from DeLonge's new group, Angels & Airwaves, in May. [...] "It Isn't' is about coming out a year later and telling the truth ... obviously we weren't going to say anything bad about him while we were recording our record, but now that it's done, we are gonna talk about it," [...] said Barker in 2006. [...] "For a year, people were saying that what Tom did was valid or called for. It eats at you. So maybe you have to talk about it, and maybe you have to write a song about it." [...] The song was titled [...] "No, It Isn't" [...] as a [...] "pre-emptive strike against the inevitable questions as to whether it is about Tom DeLonge." [...] Hoppus elaborated on the title in 2006: [...] "Originally I was going to hide behind something else when people asked what the song was about. Obviously they'd ask if it was about Tom and I was going to say, 'No, it isn't; it's about a girl I used to date,' or something. But we all love the song so much and I thought, 'Why would I hide behind anything other than that's the way I feel?' So it was actually way more meaningful and liberating to say that’s what the song’s about." ...|$|R

I have never said an unkind word about the man for whom you have cared so long. I only say now that you belong to me.

5000|$|The locals {{have given}} their own {{unofficial}} names {{to the different}} areas of Reiger Park, for example Jerusalem (due to the many churches in that area), Excuse me (due to the houses <b>so</b> close together <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> sneeze, your neighbour says bless you) and Popcorn (a new area developed in the 1990s with the houses popping up <b>so</b> fast <b>that</b> they were likened to popcorn).

5000|$|In 1996, GT won the {{commission}} to manufacture a highly aerodynamic bike design that would later {{become known as the}} [...] "Superbike," [...] hailed at the time [...] "as the best on the planet" [...] and later banned by Olympic regulations for being [...] "too fast." [...] A byproduct of a year-long development program with the U.S. national team known as Project '96, the bike featured a carbon graphite frame with no top tube, extremely thin seat and downtubes, a seat tube with a deep cutout to accommodate the rear wheel, as well as differently sized aerodynamic wheels. Describing the bike, the U. S. Cycling Federation's track endurance coach Craig Griffin said [...] "it's so thin and light, and it's as strong as anything built. It's <b>so</b> aerodynamic <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> look at it from the front, it disappears."

60|$|We {{were glad}} to embark once more and leave some of the {{mosquitoes}} behind. We found that we had camped about a mile above Hunt's, which is the last house for those who ascend Katahdin on this side. We had expected to ascend it from this point, but my companion was obliged to give up this on account of sore feet. The Indian, however, suggested that perhaps he might get a pair of moccasins at this place, {{and that he could}} walk very easily in them without hurting his feet, wearing several pairs of stockings, and he said beside <b>that</b> they were <b>so</b> porous <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> had taken in water it all drained out in a little while. We stopped to get some sugar, but found that the family had moved away, and the house was unoccupied, except temporarily by some men who were getting the hay. I noticed a seine here stretched on the bank, which probably had been used to catch salmon.|$|R
