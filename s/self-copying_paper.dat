Since the 1970s, reports have linked mucosal, skin, and general symptoms to work with <b>self-copying</b> <b>paper.</b> Emission of various particulate and volatile substances has been suggested as specific causes. These symptoms have been related to Sick Building Syndrome, which involves symptoms such as irritation to the eyes, skin, and upper airways, headache and fatigue.|$|E

[...] The study's results were that eye irritation was the most frequent symptom in industrial building spaces, at 81%.

They use data designed for another purpose to investigate an unproven hypothesis, and their findings do not add to the body of knowledge because they fail to control for the most relevant variable. We have recently become familiar with evidence pertain-ing to the potential health impact of carbonless copy paper, one form of <b>self-copying</b> <b>paper.</b> Case reports and biased questionnaire studies abound, but almost no studies have included matched controls and verified, quantified expo-sures. We are convinced that carbonless copy paper does not cause irritation or any other adverse health impact.

The aim was to evaluate the relations between work with office equipment and supplies and the occurrence of eye, nasopharyngeal, skin, and general symptoms (often denoted as sick building syndrome (SBS)), chronic respiratory symptoms, and respiratory infections. Work with <b>self-copying</b> <b>paper</b> was significantly related to weekly work-related eye, nasopharyngeal, and skin symptoms, headache and lethargy, {{as well as to the}} occurrence of wheezing, cough, mucus production, sinusitis, and acute bronchitis. Photocopying was related to nasal irritation, and video display terminal work to eye symptoms, headache, and lethargy.
