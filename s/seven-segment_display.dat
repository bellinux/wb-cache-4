5|$|The Sovereign came in satin chrome and {{gold-plated}} models, {{with leather}} pouches and fitted wooden cases. It had an 8-digit <b>seven-segment</b> <b>display</b> that used red light-emitting diodes, with a decimal {{point to the}} right of each digit that could be illuminated as necessary. Power was provided by two 1.35 mercury button cells. The Sovereign measured , which made it small and sleek compared to other calculators of the time.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the {{original}} clock was moved from its location near 42nd Street, {{and the building}} where the sign had been mounted was demolished so One Bryant Park could be built. An updated model was installed one block away {{on the side of}} a Durst building at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, facing Sixth Avenue near the southeast corner of the intersection with West 44th Street. The new clock is located next to an Internal Revenue Service office. The new clock, which can run backward, is outfitted with a brighter <b>seven-segment</b> <b>display</b> with multiple LEDs per segment, allowing the numbers to be read more easily.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology {{relies on the}} rotation of the axis of linear polarization by the liquid crystal array. Light from the backlight (or the back reflective layer, in devices not including or requiring a backlight) first passes through a linear polarizing sheet. That polarized light passes through the actual liquid crystal layer which may be organized in pixels (for a TV or computer monitor) or in another format such as a <b>seven-segment</b> <b>display</b> or one with custom symbols for a particular product. The liquid crystal layer is produced with a consistent right (or left) handed chirality, essentially consisting of tiny helices. This causes circular birefringence, and is engineered so that there is a 90 degree rotation of the linear polarization state. However, when a voltage is applied across a cell, the molecules straighten out, lessening or totally losing the circular birefringence. On the viewing side of the display is another linear polarizing sheet, usually oriented at 90 degrees from the one behind the active layer. Therefore, when the circular birefringence is removed by the application of a sufficient voltage, the polarization of the transmitted light remains at right angles to the front polarizer, and the pixel appears dark. With no voltage, however, the 90 degree rotation of the polarization causes it to exactly match the axis of the front polarizer, allowing the light through. Intermediate voltages create intermediate rotation of the polarization axis and the pixel has an intermediate intensity. Displays based on this principle are widespread, and now are used {{in the vast majority of}} televisions, computer monitors and video projectors, rendering the previous CRT technology essentially obsolete. The use of polarization in the operation of LCD displays is immediately apparent to someone wearing polarized sunglasses, often making the display unreadable.|$|E

50|$|Alphanumeric LEDs are {{available}} in seven-segment, starburst, and dot-matrix format. <b>Seven-segment</b> <b>displays</b> handle all numbers and a limited set of letters. Starburst displays can display all letters. Dot-matrix displays typically use 5x7 pixels per character. <b>Seven-segment</b> LED <b>displays</b> were in widespread use in the 1970s and 1980s, but rising use of liquid crystal displays, with their lower power needs and greater display flexibility, has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{alphabetic}} letters, {{and many}} other characters, are much clearer and unambiguously shown on the currently ubiquitous and low-priced dot matrix displays {{as well as on}} fourteen-segment and sixteen-segment displays.

50|$|The {{following}} phrases {{come from}} a portable media player's <b>seven-segment</b> <b>display.</b> They give a good illustration of an application where a <b>seven-segment</b> <b>display</b> may be sufficient for displaying letters, since the relevant messages are neither critical nor in any significant risk of being misunderstood, much due to the limited number and rigid domain specificity of the messages. As such, {{there is no direct}} need for a more expressive display in this case, although even a slightly wider repertoire of messages would require at least a 14-segment display or a dot matrix one.|$|E

50|$|A fourteen-segment display (FSD) (sometimes {{referred}} to as a starburst display) is a type of display based on 14 segments that can be turned on or off to produce letters and numerals. It is an expansion of the more common <b>seven-segment</b> <b>display,</b> having an additional four diagonal and two vertical segments with the middle horizontal segment broken in half. A <b>seven-segment</b> <b>display</b> suffices for numerals and certain letters, but unambiguously rendering the ISO basic Latin alphabet requires more detail. A slight variation is the sixteen-segment display which allows additional legibility in displaying letters or other symbols.|$|E
