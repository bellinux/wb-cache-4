5|$|Weed {{had wanted}} {{the vice presidential}} {{nomination}} for Seward (who attracted few delegate votes), and Collier had acted to frustrate them {{in more ways than}} one, for with the New Yorker Fillmore as vice president, under the political customs of the time, no one from that state could be named to the cabinet. Fillmore was accused of complicity in Collier's actions, but this was never substantiated. Nevertheless, there were sound reasons for the selection of Fillmore, as he was a proven vote-getter from electorally crucial New York, and his track record in Congress and as a candidate showed his devotion to Whig doctrine, allaying fears he might be another Tyler were <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to General Taylor. Delegates remembered him {{for his role in the}} Tariff of 1842, and he had been mentioned as a vice presidential possibility along with Lawrence and Ohio's Thomas Ewing. His rivalry with Seward (already known for anti-slavery views and statements) made him more acceptable in the South.|$|E

Bragg also won a decisive victory at the September 13 Battle of Munfordville, but the delay there cost him the larger prize of Louisville, which Don Carlos Buell moved to occupy on September 25. Having lost Louisville, Bragg spread his troops into defensive postures in the central Kentucky cities of Bardstown, Shelbyville and Danville and waited for <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> a move that historian Kenneth W. Noe called a [...] "stupendously illogical decision." ...|$|E

"The sun hadn't {{gone down}} yet, and kids were just hanging out, waiting for <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Van pulls up, {{a bunch of}} guys come out with a table, crates of records.

And he's just standing with the turntable, and the guys were studying his hands. There are people dancing, but there's as many people standing, just watching what he's doing.

500|$|Fiyero is {{confused}} about what he has just seen and what he is doing, but he is caught up in Elphaba's passion. She begins {{to fall in love}} with him and they share a moment before he has to leave to free the lion cub. Elphaba reminds herself that it's pointless to wish for <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> between them ("I'm Not that Girl"). Madame Morrible comes and tells her that the Wizard has asked to meet her. Nessarose and Galinda come to see her off, and Fiyero meets her too. Galinda tries to win his respect by changing her name to [...] "Glinda", in solidarity with Dr. Dillamond. But Fiyero barely notices, saying goodbye to Elphaba. It is suggested that her feelings for him are mutual. Elphaba invites Glinda to the Emerald City with her ("One Short Day").|$|E
500|$|Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post {{wrote that}} [...] "The Brothers Grimm looks terrific, yet it remains {{essentially}} inert. You keep waiting for <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> {{and after a}} while your mind wanders from the hollow frenzy up there with all its filigrees and fretwork." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle felt [...] "despite an appealing actor in each role, the entire cast comes across as repellent. Will and Jake Grimm are two guys in the woods, surrounded by computerized animals, putting audiences to sleep all over America." [...] Peter Travers, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, largely enjoyed The Brothers Grimm. He explained that [...] "if you're a Gilliam junkie, as I am, you go with it, even when the script loses its shaky hold on coherence." [...] Travers added, [...] "even when Gilliam flies off the rails, his images stick with you." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday called the film [...] "a great compound of rip-snorting Gothic fantasy and Python-esque dark comedy".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} {{prominent}} aspects of Nikita's character development {{since the beginning of}} the series is her relationship with Michael, and has been dubbed by fans as [...] "Mikita". Unlike other works on film and television, Silverstein did not play the traditional [...] "Will They/Won't They?" [...] game between the two characters. Co-star Shane West stated [...] "It's not hard to bring Michael and Nikita together," [...] but it is [...] "really hard to keep them apart...We're barely into the season yet, so why not keep teasing?" [...] When the first season started airing, West also expected that their romance would come, citing Michael and Nikita's past relationship while she was working with Division. Now that the two are together by the end of the first season, in the second season Silverstein wanted <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to get in their way, saying that no new tension would make the relationship boring, adding [...] "I don't think you can just have them happy and in love, kicking ass together forever." ...|$|E

2500|$|The book's main {{theme is}} about finding one's destiny. According to The New York Times, The Alchemist is [...] "more {{self-help}} than literature." [...] An old king tells Santiago that, [...] "when {{you really want}} <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> the whole universe will conspire so that your wish comes true." [...] This {{is the core of}} the novel's philosophy and a motif that plays all throughout Coelho's writing in The Alchemist.|$|E
2500|$|The Court first convened on February 2, 1790 {{with six}} judges where {{only five of}} its six initial {{positions}} were filled. According to historian Fergus Bordewich, in its first session: [...] "he Supreme Court convened {{for the first time}} at the Royal Exchange Building on Broad Street, a few steps from Federal Hall. Symbolically, the moment was pregnant with promise for the republic, this birth of a new national institution whose future power, admittedly, still existed only in the eyes and minds of just a few visionary Americans. Impressively bewigged and swathed in their robes of office, Chief Justice John Jay and three associate justices — William Cushing of Massachusetts, James Wilson of Pennsylvania, and John Blair of Virginia — sat augustly before a throng of spectators and waited for <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Nothing did. They had no cases to consider. After a week of inactivity, they adjourned until September, and everyone went home." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare's Sonnet 57, {{shows that}} [...] "his {{love for the}} fair youth is seen as pure and even heavenly…" [...] but in other sonnets he {{introduces}} new characters, one in particular the Dark Lady, [...] "his association with the dark lady leads to infection and madness of love". [...] He also uses a terminology about his love and how beautiful it appears, but when this love is being directed {{to a young man}} this might appear out of the norm at this time. In the line [...] "Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you" [...] the word [...] "sovereign" [...] implies that the youth is held at a higher degree and [...] "watch the clock for you" [...] implies that he will wait for <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> because of the youth's age or because he is waiting for the youth to recognise his love. [...] The line [...] "nor dare I question with my jealous thought" [...] implies that he has considered that jealously will raise doubts in his head and might drive his love to madness. [...] That this could end up driving the poet to insanity is suggested in this line, [...] "but, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought." [...] The Speaker is referring to himself as the slave again and is diminishing himself by implying no one would love so low and asking the fair youth to clear his mind of all thoughts of him. [...] Although he is comparing himself to a slave, the poet's love has never once subsided. [...] The last two lines saying [...] "so true a fool is love, that in your will, though you do anything, he thinks no ill." [...] The word [...] "will" [...] could be seen as desire or possibly used as a pun on his name, Will. [...] Since he thinks no ill, he is admitting that his love for the youth has made him a fool: [...] "Ultimately Shakespeare provides space for the homoerotic but must eventually return to the perpetuating systems of heterosexual love". This critique states that Shakespeare's sonnets must seen as a continuation of love sonnets that play with different ideas of love. Love could imply economic interest or patronage. Another way of viewing the poet's intent could be a sexual or erotic attraction (as the critic Rudd emphasises) or a brotherly or platonic affection.|$|E
