5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll <b>set</b> <b>my</b> own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, the TV program Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters premiered on NBC. In {{addition}} to hosts Barbara, Louise, and Irlene, the show featured musical guests and comedy sketches. Each broadcast also {{closed with a}} gospel song, which led to Mandrell recording her own inspirational album, He <b>Set</b> <b>My</b> Life to Music (1982). As {{a result of her}} busy schedule, she began suffering from vocal strain, and on doctor's orders, pulled the plug on the television program in 1982. (Variety shows were also falling out of favor at the time; the series was NBC's last variety series to date.) She received one award (People's Choice) and two nominations (Golden Globe and TV Land Award) for her work on the show. In 1983, she premiered The Lady Is a Champ, a Las Vegas stage show.|$|E

50|$|Cedric reluctantly {{moved out}} of England in the late 1960s, to avoid the {{crippling}} estate taxes imposed upon the citizenry.

All of the above information regarding Ailesbury's books is taken from <b>Setting</b> <b>My</b> Watch by the Sundial, which mentioned all of his books by name.

2500|$|The Gemara deduced from [...] "And {{let them}} make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them," [...] that the Tabernacle was called [...] "Sanctuary."
