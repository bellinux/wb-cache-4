5|$|Prostitution is {{considered}} sinful {{for both the}} prostitute and the customer; it reduces a person to an instrument of <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure,</b> violating human dignity and harming society. The gravity of the sinfulness is less for prostitutes who are forced into the act by destitution, blackmail or social pressure.|$|E
5|$|Extensive sociological, sexological {{and medical}} debate {{have focused on}} the clitoris, {{primarily}} concerning anatomical accuracy, orgasmic factors and their physiological explanation for the G-spot, and whether the clitoris is vestigial, an adaptation, or serves a reproductive function. Social perceptions of the clitoris range from the significance of its role in female <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure,</b> assumptions about its true size and depth, and varying beliefs regarding genital modification such as clitoris enlargement, clitoris piercing and clitoridectomy. Genital modification may be for aesthetic, medical or cultural reasons.|$|E

5|$|French {{psychoanalyst}} Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian {{ethics in}} his works The Ethics of Psychoanalysis and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade. Lacan argued that Sade's maxim of jouissance—the pursuit of <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure</b> or enjoyment—is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria {{because it can}} be universalised. He proposed that, while Kant presented human freedom as critical to the moral law, Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of nerve endings in the clitoris, {{the majority of}} which exist specifically for sexual enjoyment, make it the human female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure.</b> Sexual stimulation of the clitoris can produce female sexual arousal and orgasm, and may be achieved by masturbation or with a sexual partner. The most effective sexual stimulation of the organ is usually through manual or oral stimulation (cunnilingus), {{often referred to as}} direct clitoral stimulation; in cases involving sexual penetration, these activities may also be referred to as additional or assisted clitoral stimulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure.</b> In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on {{the presence or absence}} of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the size and shape of a pea, and is estimated to have more than 8,000 sensory nerve endings.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores eroticism and {{pleasure}} in Diane Case’s Toasted Penis and Cheese showing {{the wide variety}} of available <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasures</b> to men and women, but with emphasis on the avenues of pleasure available to the woman. <b>Sexual</b> <b>pleasures</b> in the novel are presented in binary forms with the socio-cultural and religious factors determining what are classified in these binaries as good/bad, moral/immoral, and acceptable/unacceptable. Case represents different understandings and ideologies over varied <b>sexual</b> behaviours and <b>pleasure</b> without subscribing to the inhibitions generated by these ideologies – she rather places adult consent over them. The degree of sexual satisfaction or its denial contributes significantly to the general wellbeing of the individual, and, to an extent, determines the pace of human inter-relations...|$|R
5|$|The {{foreskin}} extends {{out from}} the base of the glans and covers the glans when the penis is flaccid. Proposed theories for the purpose of the foreskin are that it serves to protect the penis as the fetus develops in the mother's womb, that it helps to preserve moisture in the glans, and that it improves <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure.</b> The foreskin may also be a pathway of infection for certain diseases. Circumcision removes the foreskin at its attachment to the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} {{piercing}} or not piercing are varied. Some people pierce for religious or spiritual reasons, while others pierce for self-expression, for aesthetic value, for <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure,</b> {{to conform to}} their culture or to rebel against it. Some forms of piercing remain controversial, particularly when applied to youth. The display or placement of piercings have been restricted by schools, employers and religious groups. In spite of the controversy, some people have practiced extreme forms of body piercing, with Guinness bestowing World Records on individuals with hundreds and even thousands of permanent and temporary piercings.|$|E
5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, condom use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses. Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that condom use during marital sex implies infidelity. Others believe that marital condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage: <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure</b> and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners.|$|E

5|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} of the clitoris {{is the most common}} way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach orgasm, though indirect clitoral stimulation (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of the vagina (the lower third) contains nearly 90percent of the vaginal nerve endings, and there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure,</b> including orgasm, solely from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris.|$|E

25|$|The authors {{detected}} four trends {{during their}} interviews: <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure</b> increased {{with the amount}} of sexual experience the participants had; those who had experienced sexual difficulties were typically sex-avoidant; some participants continued to engage in regular sexual activity even if they had low interest; and lastly, many experienced pain when engaging in sexual activity if they experienced low arousal.|$|E
25|$|The {{realistic}} {{detail in}} Moche ceramics {{may have helped}} them serve as didactic models.

25|$|General {{statistics}} {{indicate that}} 70–80% of women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm. The vaginal walls contain significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris and anus, and therefore intense <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure,</b> including orgasm, from vaginal sexual stimulation {{is less likely}} to occur than from direct clitoral stimulation in the majority of women. Achieving orgasm solely by anal stimulation, however, is rare among women.|$|E

25|$|In males, orgasm {{is usually}} {{associated}} with ejaculation. Each ejection is accompanied with continuous pulses of <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure,</b> especially in the penis and loins. Other sensations may be felt strongly among the lower spine, or lower back. The first and second convulsions are usually the most intense in sensation, and produce the greatest quantity of semen. Thereafter, each contraction {{is associated with a}} diminishing volume of semen and a milder sensation of pleasure.|$|E
25|$|The anal sphincters {{are usually}} tighter than the pelvic {{muscles of the}} vagina, which can enhance the <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure</b> for the {{inserting}} male during male-to-female anal intercourse because of the pressure applied to the penis. Men may also enjoy the penetrative role during anal sex because of its association with dominance, because it is made more alluring by a female partner or society in general insisting that it is forbidden, or because it presents an additional option for penetration.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to penile penetration, pleasure can be received from vaginal stimulation {{in a variety}} of ways. It may be by masturbation, fingering, oral sex (cunnilingus), or specific sex positions (such as the missionary position or the spoons sex position). Heterosexual couples may engage in cunnilingus or fingering as forms of foreplay to incite sexual arousal, with penile-vaginal penetration as the primary sexual activity, or they may engage in them in {{addition to}} penile-vaginal penetration; in other cases, heterosexual couples use the latter acts as a way to preserve virginity or as a type of birth control. By contrast, lesbians and other women who have sex with women commonly engage in cunnilingus or fingering as main forms of sexual activity. Some women and couples use sex toys, such as a vibrator or dildo, for vaginal pleasure. Other women may adopt Kegel exercises, with the aim of tightening the vagina to increase <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure.</b> The Kama Sutra, an ancient Hindu text written by Vātsyāyana, which includes a number of sexual positions, may also be used to increase <b>sexual</b> <b>pleasure,</b> with special emphasis on female sexual satisfaction.|$|E
