MethodsSix participants completed 15 [*]min running under two conditions (LTM and ATM) in a randomised and balanced order, matched for <b>speed.</b> <b>Synchronised</b> tri-axial accelerometers placed at the distal tibia, lumbar region, and forehead were used to identify running dynamics and measure acceleration on impact and its attenuation. Expired respiratory gases and heart rate were sampled on a breath-by-breath basis for physiological variable collection throughout each trial. ResultsParticipants experienced reduced accelerations on impact at the distal tibia (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) but not the lower back or forehead (p[*]=[*] 0. 1363) during ATM compared to LTM. Consequently, large reductions (p[*]=[*] 0. 0001) in shock attenuation occurred during the ATM compared to LTM. Stride frequency was greater (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and stride length shorter (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) as a result of reduced swing time (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) for LTM, whilst ATM running increased (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) physiological demand for both heart rate and O 2 compared to LTM.

40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} was to research, develop and test an {{induction}} motor drive not requiring a speed encoder, but which could be considered commercially viable by motor drives manufacturers, and which should aim to meet the follow requirements: • Dynamic torque performance and steady state speed-holding accuracy to be comparable with encodered vector controlled drives • Extensive and highly accurate knowledge of electrical and mechanical parameters of the motor and load not to be required • Extensive commissioning from an expert engineer not to be necessary • Algorithm not to rely on excessive computational capability being available The drive was to operate, in a stable manner, over speed and load ranges at least comparable with commercially available sensorless induction motor drives. The above requirements were set such that the developed sensorless technique may be considered for synchronised multi-motor process applications, where the advantages of a sensorless system could be exploited for hazardous, damp and hot conditions. The solution developed consists of a leading model-based sensorless method augmented with a speed estimator that tracks harmonics, seen in the stator terminal quantities, due to rotor slotting. The model-based scheme facilitates field-orientated control for dynamic performance. The slot harmonic speed estimator tunes the model for speed accuracy. Slot harmonics are identified using a recursive signal processing method termed the Recursive Maximum Likelihood - Adaptive Tracking Filter. This work is the first example of the method being developed into a practical sensorless drive system and the complete speed identifier is described, including set-up, pre-filtering and the minimal parameter considerations. Being recursive the method is computationally efficient, yet has accuracy comparable with that of FFT identifiers used in other work. The developed sensorless strategy was implemented practically on two motor drive systems. The performance of the scheme is shown to give encoder like speed holding accuracy and field-orientated dynamic performance. The two drives were also configured and tested as a <b>speed</b> <b>synchronised</b> pair, using applicable multi-motor control techniques, themselves compared and contrasted. The sensorless performance is demonstrated, alongside an encodered version acting as a benchmark, {{and the performance of}} the two schemes is shown to be highly comparable. The author has found no other example of sensorless techniques considered for use in multi-motor applications. The use of such a technique brings established advantages associated with encoder removal and allows multi-axis electronic synchronisation to be considered for parts of a process where an encoder may not be appropriate...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of separate, yet complimentary, cortical pathways appears {{to play a}} role in visual perception and action when intercepting objects. The ventral system is responsible for object recognition and identification, while the dorsal system facilitates continuous regulation of action. This dual-system model implies that empirically manipulating different visual information sources during performance of an interceptive action might lead to the emergence of distinct gaze and movement pattern profiles. To test this idea, we recorded hand kinematics and eye movements of participants as they attempted to catch balls projected from a novel apparatus that synchronised or de-synchronised accompanying video images of a throwing action and ball trajectory. Results revealed that ball catching performance was less successful when patterns of hand movements and gaze behaviours were constrained by the absence of advanced perceptual information from the thrower's actions. Under these task constraints, participants began tracking the ball later, followed less of its trajectory, and adapted their actions by initiating movements later and moving the hand faster. There were no performance differences when the throwing action image and ball <b>speed</b> were <b>synchronised</b> or de-synchronised since hand movements were closely linked to information from ball trajectory. Results are interpreted relative to the two-visual system hypothesis, demonstrating that accurate interception requires {{integration of}} advanced visual information from kinematics of the throwing action and from ball flight trajectory...|$|R

A fixed-time algorithm measures angular displacement at fixed-time intervals, while a fixed-space algorithm measures time every fixed-angular displacement. Time and displacement measurements {{were used to}} generate estimations for speed. The new algorithm generated a unique value for estimating <b>speed</b> due to <b>synchronising</b> encoder pulses and a signal formed by impulses every time increase (delta). A first modification of the proposed algorithm was defined, resulting in the harmonic mean between these two proposed alternatives having the smallest relative error possible.

40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} mixing of a low-diffusivity dye in a swarm of bubbles at high Reynolds number {{confined}} in a Hele-Shaw cell for gas volume fractions ranging from 1. 4 to 5. 4 %. A patch of a fluo- rescent dye is injected within the swarm and, during its mixing, its concentration is measured at a given location in an observation volume of 4. 5 mm 2 by means of Laser Induced Fluorescence at a frequency of 250 Hz. A spectrometer is used to analyse the light issued from the observation volume and to dis- tinguish the fluoresced light from other light sources. Simultaneously, the bubble distribution around the observation volume is imaged with a high <b>speed</b> camera <b>synchronised</b> with the spectrometer {{in order to assess}} the LIF technique in bubbly flow. Thanks to the good time resolution, rapid and intense concen- tration fluctuations corresponding to dye patches passing through the observation volume are recorded and are superimposed to a slow global evolution. This slow global evolution shows first an increase of the concentration and then an exponential decrease due to the mixing by bubble-induced agitation. This exponential decay, which is incompatible with a diffusion process, is consistent with the transport by dye capture in bubbles wakes that are quickly dampened by the shear-stress at the walls. The one-point statistics of the concentration fluctuations (probability density function and spectrum) also point out that mixing in a confined bubbly flow is intermittent and convective...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{a proposed}} relative position monitoring system using GPS-based technology during crop harvesting in the Australian sugarcane industry. It describes {{the application of}} Precision Agriculture (PA) techniques to synchronise the operation of harvester and haul-out transport vehicles. The overall aim of this project is to reduce operator demands during in-field harvesting of sugarcane whilst maximising crop yield through automation. There are two stages of the project to achieve this. The final stage is the automation of harvester forward speed to maintain a constant throughput of sugarcane at an optimal rate. Providing this real-time assistance to harvester operators {{will allow them to}} concentrate on other key functions such as base cutter height operation, leading to reduced operator fatigue. Since the harvester <b>speed</b> varies, <b>synchronising</b> the relative position of the accompanying haul-out transport vehicle is essential to ensure billet collection is maximised. This first stage requires the haul-out to know the position of the harvester, and that relevant information is presented to the haul-out operator so bins can be filled evenly and accurately with minimal spillage. This paper describes the system developed to achieve the first stage of the project. Key components of this system are the invehicle display developed using the programming language C#, the use of real time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) for auto-steering and position determination, and the use of an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network for inter-vehicle wireless communications. A description is given of the necessary electronics and computer hardware and software used to give operators an aerial view of where their vehicles are. In-field test data shows the system provides sufficient accuracy to achieve the desired result...|$|R
40|$|Van der Kamp {{and colleagues}} (2008) contended that interceptive actions involve the {{integration}} between separate, yet complimentary, cortical pathways responsible for visual perception. The ventral stream is proposed {{to be responsible}} for object identification and determining an intended response, while the dorsal stream is considered {{to be responsible for}} ongoing regulation of action. These ideas imply that manipulation of different information sources during performance of an interceptive action might lead to the emergence of distinct movement pattern profiles. In this experiment we examined these ideas by studying hand kinematics and eye movements of participants as they attempted to catch balls projected from a novel apparatus that coupled video of a throwing action and a ball projection machine. Participants coordinated their actions in three conditions: no video – ball projection only; matching condition – ball projection synchronised with video of an actor throwing a ball; mismatch condition – ball projection <b>speed</b> not <b>synchronised</b> with video of the throwing action. Results revealed that patterns of hand movements and gaze behaviours were influenced by absence of perceptual information of the throwing action; movement initiation occurred later, the hand moved faster, and reached its maximum grip aperture faster in the no video condition (ball flight only). Fewer image areas were sampled, tracking began later, and less of the ball’s trajectory was tracked in the no video condition as well. There were no performance differences between the matching and mismatch image synchronisation conditions. Data were congruent with contentions of Van der Kamp and colleagues (2008), demonstrating that advanced perceptual (ventral) information is important for shaping intentions, perception and action regulation, while ball flight (dorsal) information is mainly used to guide action during task performance...|$|R
40|$|When {{assessing}} {{the quality of}} a brass instrument the player must consider a number of factors, the main consideration being the playability of the chosen instrument. The playability of an instrument is a broad term used to describe how well the instrument plays; this includes how in tune the resonant modes are, {{how easy it is to}} start and move between notes, how easy it is to bend notes and the degree of spectral enrichment during a crescendo that is able to be produced. The starting transient is known to be of crucial importance for both the musician and listener, and previous work in the field has been mainly concerned with such starting transients; this work focusses on inter-note transitions. Transitions between notes include both starting and finishing transients as the initial note is ended and the next begun. Using high <b>speed</b> photography images <b>synchronised</b> with pressure signals from the mouthpiece and bell end, the internote transitions are explored. Results from these experiments are compared with those from a simple one dimensional time domain model. Other techniques used to determine the playability of a specific instrument include the rate at which the instrument timbre becomes `brassy' due to nonlinear effects, that are a consequence of loud playing. The relative significance of viscothermal wall losses and nonlinear effects within realistic brass instruments have been explored here using experiments on cylindrical tubes of different internal diameters. These experimental results are compared with results from a computational model that uses weakly nonlinear wave propagation theory and includes viscothermal losses. It is also possible on some brass instruments, when playing loudly, to achieve what are known as super high notes; these notes are above the frequency where the instrument has well defined resonances. Experimental results are presented here using optical techniques to visualise the motion of the player's lips during playing of these super high notes...|$|R
