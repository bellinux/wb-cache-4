However, there is comparatively less experience on usage of ester-based insulating liquids in large power transformers. The high reliability and safety level required for large power transformers lead to careful {{assessment of the}} use of ester as the insulating liquid in these units. Therefore, this study assesses the ageing behavior of the dry pressboard insulation immersed in a commercially available natural <b>ester</b> and a <b>synthetic</b> <b>ester</b> through accelerated ageing experiment. At different stages of ageing, oil conditions are analyzing by measuring acidity value, 2 -furaldehyde (2 -FAL) concentration and kinematic viscosity.

Moreover, the change of AC breakdown strength of natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>ester</b> due to mixing with mineral oil (new and aged) is analyzed.

40|$|To {{make the}} hydro power {{application}} more environmentally adapted new EALs such as <b>synthetic</b> <b>esters</b> {{will replace the}} existing mineral oils. This study aims to exploit the EALs potential in boundary lubrication, especially in slow sliding journal bearings with shaft oscillation as those supporting the Kaplan turbine blades. In order to evaluate the performance of different lubricated environmentally adapted journal bearings a test rig was built. Many test rig parameters were set to simulate water turbine conditions. Tests were performed with different bearing and shaft materials and different lubricants suited for water turbine application, EALs, water with and the present used mineral oil reference. Additional lubricated tests in oscillating motion were conducted with a roller on disc and a pin on disc. All tests were performed with oscillating motion. The results showed that <b>synthetic</b> <b>esters</b> affect the contact material to a larger extent than the tested mineral oil. The <b>synthetic</b> <b>esters</b> were also sensitive to the selection of bearing and shaft material. Highly alloyed bronzes were more prone to corrosive wear. A coated shaft showed excellent performance with a low alloyed tin bronze. The comparison of self lubricated bearings with water lubrication to an EAL lubricated tin bronze on stainless steel showed large performance differences between the water lubricated materials. They showed both better and worse friction and wear results than the EAL lubricated tin bronze. The oscillating pin on disc can generate similar contact mechanisms as in a journal bearing. The most important conclusion of this work {{is that it is}} possible to find self lubricated journal bearings better suited for shaft oscillation than EAL lubricated bronze bearings in water turbine application. Water lubricated design of the bearings are the most environmentally adapted solution.

40|$|Rail {{lubrication}} in curves {{was widely}} introduced in Sweden during the 1970 ’s {{due to the}} high wear rate of gauge faces in sharp curves. The first tests performed in Sweden showed that lubrication decreased wear rates by roughly 10 times. Based upon these results, the Swedish track system was equipped with wayside lubricators called Clicomatic. Aside from wear, rolling contact fatigue (RCF) is another limiting factor in railway infrastructure productivity. Head checking {{is one of the}} fatigue forms that arises in curves of heavily loaded tracks as well as fast train tracks. Head checkings grow at the rail head, close to the gauge corner. High pressure and a sliding motion lead to plastic strain of the material from the rail ball towards the gauge face. There is a coupling between wear rates and RCF damages, high wear rates may lead to reduced RCF damages and vice versa. Hence, frequent application of lubricants to the rail does extend the rail life by several times but may, on the other hand, lead to fatigue problems. Preventive grinding in combination with lubrication has been {{the most efficient way to}} avoid fast degrading of curved rail track. This thesis concerns the progress of rail lubrication in terms of how environmentally adapted lubricants function both in wayside lubricators and at the track. Another aspect of the thesis is to find a lubricant able to reduce the wear rate at the gauge face while simultaneously decreasing the crack growth at the rail head. One thought was to use controlled wear to reduce rolling contact fatigue. Controlled wear in this situation means that the usage of a lubricant should give a sufficiently high wear rate to continuously wear off the surface layers. Another idea along the same lines was that of low contact friction. Low friction in the contact gives less plastic strain and subsequently less head checking. Rapeseed oil had shown low contact friction in earlier testing, therefore, <b>synthetic</b> <b>esters</b> were of interest to examine in this application. From both field tests and laboratory tests it was concluded that the wear protection for environmentally adapted lubricants was comparable to that of previously used lubricants if they were applied by trackside lubricators. Although they were known to be more sensitive to low temperatures, testing showed how to overcome this issue. Wear and friction tests were performed in the laboratory to evaluate lubricating blends. The tests evaluated rolling / sliding as well as pure sliding contacts. The research performed in this thesis yielded the following results. Pure <b>synthetic</b> <b>ester</b> (TMP-Oleat and TMP-C 8 -C 10) in a sliding contact resulted in high wear rates and a lot of abrasive marks at the surface. By adding friction modifiers, the friction as well as the wear rate decreased considerably in the sliding contact. In the rolling sliding contact, <b>synthetic</b> <b>ester</b> alone and <b>synthetic</b> <b>ester</b> with the addition of friction modifiers both showed similarly low friction and wear rates. PAO gave higher friction, but at the same time, the surfaces had significantly fewer cracks as compared to <b>synthetic</b> <b>ester</b> formulations. One observation was that surfaces lubricated by <b>synthetic</b> <b>esters</b> became less hard and the hardness interval was wider than those lubricated with PAO. One explanation is that even if the overall friction is low, local spots of high friction between asperities can lead to localized strain and crack initiation. The conclusions are that Rapeseed oil is the recommended base for rail lubricants. The tested <b>synthetic</b> <b>esters</b> are a more expensive alternative useful if excellent low temperature properties are needed. Graphite is not necessary in the lubricant if it is applied continuously by a wayside lubricator. Twin-disc tests showed that low contact friction does not necessary mean that crack initiations are avoided in the surface. In conclusion, the base fluid and the additives influenced not only the wear rate but also the ability for cracks to grow. Godkänd; 2006; 20061116 (pafi...|$|R
40|$|Minimum {{quantity}} lubrication (MQL) machining {{involves the}} application of small quantity of lubricant to the tool-workpiece interface. This paper describes {{the results of an}} investigation on the effects of using different MQL lubricants (<b>synthetic</b> <b>ester</b> and palm oil) on the drilling of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V.

The outstanding performance of palm oil in reducing the value of those responses was attributed to its ability to form a thin film which promoted boundary lubrication during the machining process.

40|$|Low {{viscosity}} {{base oils}} {{are one of}} the candidates for fuel saving lubricants for internal combustion engines. These lubricants reduce viscous friction under hydrodynamic conditions, so reduce total energy loss at tribological contact. However, these oils provide thinner oil films resulting in magnified wear. Therefore, wear protection of rubbing surfaces is very important to apply low viscosity oils in practice. Effects of phosphorus-containing additives on antiwear properties of low viscosity base oils were evaluated under boundary lubrication conditions using a four-ball type wear tester according to ASTM D 4172. For mineral based oils, dialkyl phosphonates considerably reduced wear whereas trialkyl and triaryl phosphonates did not. Compatibility of additive with mineral based oil depends on the refining process of the oil. Wear prevention by phosphorus-containing additive in solvent-extracted mineral oils was sometimes unpredictable. Additive response for hydrogen-refined mineral oils was better than that for solvent-extracted oils. The results showed good accordance with phosphorus contents on the worn surfaces obtained by surface analysis. At least 0. 062 mass% (620 ppm) of phosphorus is required to achieve sufficient antiwear properties in hydrogen-refined mineral oils. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>esters</b> have good lubricity in comparison with mineral oils. However, conventional antiwear additives for mineral oils are not always effective for <b>synthetic</b> <b>esters,</b> especially low viscosity esters.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{comparative}} study of AC and DC breakdown voltages of based mineral oil mixtures with natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>esters</b> mainly used in high voltage power transformers. The goal was to analyze the performances of oil mixtures from the dielectric withstand {{point of view and}} to predict the behavior of transformers originally filled with mineral oil and re-filled with <b>synthetic</b> or natural <b>ester</b> oils when emptied for maintenance. The study concerns mixtures based on 20 %, 50 %, and 80 % of natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>ester</b> oils. AC breakdown voltages were measured using a sphere-sphere electrode system according to IEC 60156 specifications; the same specification was adopted for DC measurements since there is no standard specifications for this voltage waveform. A statistical analysis of the mean values, standard deviations, and histograms of breakdown voltage data was carried out. The Normal and Weibull distribution functions were used to analyze the experimental data and the best function that the data followed was used to estimate the breakdown voltage with risk of 1 %, 10 %, and 50 % probability. It was shown that whatever the applied voltage waveforms, ester oils always have a significantly higher breakdown voltage than mineral oil. The addition of only 20 % of natural or <b>synthetic</b> <b>ester</b> oil was sufficient to considerably increase the breakdown voltage of mineral oil. The dielectric strength of such a mixture is much higher than that of mineral oil alone and can reach that of ester oils.
