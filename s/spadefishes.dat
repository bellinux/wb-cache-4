50|$|Ephippus is a genus of <b>spadefishes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some <b>spadefishes</b> {{are popular}} sport fishing catches. The Atlantic spadefish (Chaetodipterus faber), for example, {{is a black}} and white striped fish common just {{offshore}} in the southeastern United States and Caribbean. They are favorites because they put up a fight as they are reeled in. Spadefish are generally considered to be an overfished group. Most of the individuals caught are small, young, and not near the maximum size recorded for their species.|$|E
50|$|Atlantic <b>spadefishes</b> {{are not of}} much {{commercial}} value. Due {{to their}} reputation as strong fighters, they are popular game fish, especially {{during the summer months}} when they are most active. The Atlantic spadefish has become a popular target species for sportfishermen due to their abundance and the strong fight they have for their size. They are good table fare, especially if smoked or grilled. A common method of catching involves using small pieces of clam on a small circle hook.|$|E
5000|$|Chaetodipterus faber {{is known}} by {{numerous}} colloquial names, including Atlantic <b>spadefish,</b> angelfish, white angelfish, threetailed porgy, ocean cobbler, and moonfish. Their scientific name {{is derived from}} the Greek word [...] "chaite" [...] meaning [...] "chair" [...] and [...] "dipteros" [...] meaning [...] "with two fins." [...] The Atlantic <b>spadefish</b> belongs to the genus Chaetodipterus, which includes two other species: the West African <b>spadefish</b> (Chaetodipterus lippei) and the Pacific <b>spadefish</b> (Chaetodipterus zonatus). The Chaetodipterus genus belongs to the Ephippidae family, which includes <b>spadefish</b> and batfish.|$|R
50|$|USS <b>Spadefish</b> (SSN-668), a , was {{the second}} ship of the United States Navy to be named for the <b>spadefish,</b> a spiny-finned fish found in coastal waters of the western Atlantic from Cuba to Cape Cod.|$|R

50|$|Spawning {{primarily}} {{occurs in}} the summer along both the Atlantic and the U. Gulf of Mexico coasts, with peaks during July and August. Large congregations of tripletails {{during the summer months}} in the inshore and nearshore waters of coastal Georgia suggest this area is a critical estuarian spawning habitat for the species. Larval Atlantic tripletails go though four levels of development; preflexion, flexion, postflexion, and transformation. By the time the larvae reach 0.16 in (4 mm), they have large eyes and concave heads. The larval forms of Atlantic tripletails resemble those of boarfishes, some jacks, <b>spadefishes,</b> and bass.|$|E
50|$|Ephippidae is {{a family}} {{containing}} the <b>spadefishes,</b> with about eight genera {{and a total of}} 20 marine species. Well-known species include the Atlantic spadefish (Chaetodipterus faber) and the reef-dwelling genus Platax, the batfishes, which are kept as aquarium fish. They are spade-shaped and laterally compressed, and have very symmetrical, triangular dorsal and anal fins. They are shiny silver with areas of yellow and vertical brown or black banding. The eyes are often located in one of the vertical bands as a method of camouflage. Scuba divers sometimes mistake them for angelfish, which are similar in shape, but not closely related. Other genera in the family are characterized by long, trailing, pointed dorsal and anal fins. Most species feed primarily on algae and small invertebrates.|$|E
40|$|Platax teira, {{also known}} as the teira batfish, longfin batfish, longfin spadefish is known to {{associate}} with floating seaweed, debris and artificial reefs. We report for the first time from Persian Gulf (Kish Island, Iran). Maximum length is 40 - 50 cm in Persian Gulf. Juveniles and adults occur inshore on protected reefs and in mangrove areas and also on wrecks and deep reefs to 20 m; they may be solitary, in pairs, or in large schools. Small juveniles with floating debris and form aggregations as they find each other. They can be pelagic to large sizes and form schools under large Sargassum rafts that usually form after the wet season. Like most <b>spadefishes,</b> this species is unafraid of divers. Flesh excellent, or rank, with a weedy flavor. The long-finned juveniles are valuable in the aquarium fish trade...|$|E

50|$|Parapsettus panamensis, the Panama <b>spadefish,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>spadefish</b> native to the Pacific coast of the Americas from the Gulf of California to Peru. This species grows to a length of 30 cm TL though most do not exceed 20 cm TL. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|R

40|$|The family Ephippidae, {{commonly}} known as <b>spadefishes,</b> comprises eight genera (Nelson, 2006) and 15 valid species (Eschmeyer & Fong, 2014), mostly inhabiting coastal waters around reefs, up {{to a depth of}} 30 m (Nelson, 2006). The genus Platax is the most speciose, while the genus Tripterodon is monotypic (Jawad et al., 2012). The maximum length attained by Tripterodon orbis is 750 mm (Fischer & Bianchi, 1984; Heemstra & Heemstra, 2004), with common lengths reaching 300 mm. They feed on rock and coral-dwelling organisms and their flesh is edible (Froese & Pauly, 2014). The species had earlier been reported from the Western Indian Ocean (Somalia, Kenya, south to Algoa Bay, South Africa), from the Red sea and from the eastern Indian Ocean (Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Sri Lanka) (Froese & Pauly, 2014). Indrasenan (1960) had also reported the occurrence of Tripterodon orbis from Rameswaram Island, in the Gulf of Mannar, south-east coast of India. However, this is the first occurrence of the species at Visakhapatnam along the north-east coast of India, a signifi- cant extension of its distribution from the southern to the northern region, along the Bay of Bengal...|$|E
40|$|The goliath grouper Epinephelus itajara {{is a large}} sized (> 400 kg) and {{critically}} endangered marine fish, which is protected in many countries, including Brazil. Through the application of semi-structured interviews, we investigated the local ecological knowledge of seven fishermen specialist on catching E. itajara from the Babitonga bay, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Local long-line fisheries for E. itajara {{seemed to be a}} disappearing tradition in the studied site, with a detailed inherent local ecological knowledge system, which is also being lost. Our study also showed that fishermen engaged in recent fisheries, such as spear-fishing, can also possess a detailed local ecological knowledge system. Through the analysis of fishermen local ecological knowledge, several aspects of E. itajara life history were registered. This species is found in the inner and outer Babitonga bay, from saline waters to areas with a large input of freshwater, and inhabits submerged wooden substrates and artificial reefs such as shipwrecks, mooring pillars and cargo containers. It is known to spawn in December and subsequent summer months in the studied area. Spawning aggregations are usually seen in December (during full moon), being also eventually observed in January and February by our informants. While lobsters, <b>spadefishes</b> and octopuses seem to constitute the most important food items of inner bay E. itajara, outer bay individuals may feed on catfishes, crustaceans and other fish species. The goliath grouper is regarded as pacific and curious fish, but frequently display agonistic behavior in the presence of divers. Based on the perception of well experienced spear fishermen, we hypothesize that E. itajara undertakes seasonal migrations from the inner to the outer bay during summer, and that the studied population is suffering from growth over-fishing. Our data provides a practical evidence of how joining scientific and local ecological knowledge will likely benefit E. itajara local conservation and management practices by adding important new biological data into the decision-making process...|$|E

5000|$|For {{several hours}} into the next day, <b>Spadefish</b> {{attempted}} {{to get around the}} escort to attack the damaged ship anchored in the cove. The submarine finally let go with four stern torpedoes at the destroyer, but the enemy zigged clear and proceeded to depth charge the entire area. Having only three torpedoes remaining, <b>Spadefish</b> set course for Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, to replenish her supply.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{researchers}} regard Exellia as a <b>spadefish,</b> though, some remove this genus, and {{the related}} Eoluvarus to a separate family, [...] "Exelliidae." ...|$|R
50|$|Exellia is a genus of extinct <b>spadefish</b> {{that lived}} in the Tethys Ocean during the early Paleogene. The adult form is shaped akin to a large <b>spadefish</b> or a short dolphinfish, with very large pelvic fins, and a long dorsal fin {{starting}} from {{in front of the}} eyes to near the base of the caudal peduncle. The juvenile form resembles a juvenile drumfish, with the dorsal fin forming a long crest on top of the head.|$|R
50|$|Other {{portions}} of the scattered convoy were attacked by Redfish and <b>Spadefish.</b> Japanese sources indicate Tamatsu Maru simply disappeared. Uncertainty remains about which submarines launched torpedoes striking the ships of convoy Hi-71; but JANAC credited <b>Spadefish</b> with sinking Tamatsu Maru fleeing northward at 0333. Sado, Matsuwa and Hiburi attempted to hold the American submarines down while Noshiro Maru and Awa Maru beached themselves at Port Currimao to avoid sinking, and undamaged ships took refuge in San Fernando, La Union.|$|R
5000|$|After {{spending}} the holidays at Majuro, <b>Spadefish</b> departed on 6 January 1945 for her third war patrol, conducted with , , and [...] in the Yellow Sea. On 28 January, she intercepted an enemy convoy {{and let go}} with two spreads of torpedoes. The 7,158-ton converted seaplane tender Sanuki Maru, exploded and quickly sank, and the frigate Kume, spouted flames and began slowly to sink. Three enemy escorts pounced on <b>Spadefish,</b> but the submarine made her escape and continued her patrol.|$|R
25|$|As {{the convoy}} was {{scattered}} by heavy seas and evasive maneuvers, Tamatsu Maru apparently became separated from convoy escorts. <b>Spadefish</b> found Tamatsu Maru on a northerly course about 0330 19 August and fired a salvo of six torpedoes. <b>Spadefish</b> heard two torpedoes hit. Convoy escorts {{were unaware of}} the ship's location until one of them discovered thousands of floating bodies that afternoon. The sinking of Tamatsu Maru was the fourth worst loss of life on any Japanese vessel during the war.|$|R
50|$|In life, T. finitimus {{would have}} resembled a <b>spadefish</b> with beak-like lips, {{or a very}} small opah (its closest living relative) with a bulging forehead.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spadefish</b> was {{assigned}} Norfolk, Virginia, as her home port, and it remained her home port throughout her career. She {{was attached to}} Submarine Squadron 6.|$|R
50|$|Although {{she was out}} of torpedoes, <b>Spadefish</b> {{continued}} to trail the remaining ships of the convoy that first took refuge in the harbor of Ishigaki; and then, in company with five escorts, continued their voyage. <b>Spadefish</b> terminated her first war patrol at Pearl Harbor on 24 September, having sunk six enemy ships for a total of over 31,500 tons. With the additional 33,000 tons sunk by her sister submarines, the coordinated attack group accounted for a total of 13 ships and over 64,000 tons of enemy shipping.|$|R
2500|$|At 12:15 one American Boeing B-29 Superfortress {{was spotted}} at {{position}} 34-08'N, 125-39'E. It dropped a bomb on the convoy but missed and the aircraft was chased away by torpedo bombers from the Shinyo. The B-29 reported the convoy's position to command which helped coordinate submarine attacks. Several hours later at 4:15 pm the landing ship Mayasan Maru exploded {{directly in front}} of the Shinyo just as Captain Ishii was landing his last air patrol for the day. It had been hit by at least one torpedo from USS Picuda. Mayasan sank with a loss of 3,437 men killed, most of whom were soldiers. Almost twelve hours later 200 kilometers off Saishu Island, <b>Spadefish</b> surfaced and attacked the Shinyo with six torpedoes. Four struck the carrier on the starboard at 11:03 pm, and it caught fire. At least 1,130 Japanese sailors went down with their ship; only about seventy survived, including Ishii. Kashi immediately dropped several depth charges where the <b>Spadefish</b> was thought to be. An oil slick and other debris eventually made the Japanese believe they had sunk <b>Spadefish</b> so the Kashi broke off the engagement, but <b>Spadefish</b> had escaped apparently without serious damage. Only minor cracks were reported to have appeared on the submarine after the alleged [...] "sinking" [...] by Kashi.|$|R
