5|$|The Cunard White Star Line's RMS Queen Elizabeth {{was named}} after her. She {{launched}} the ship on 27 September 1938 in Clydebank, Scotland. Supposedly, the liner started to <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> the water before Elizabeth could officially launch her, and acting sharply, she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the liner's bow just before it slid out of reach. In 1954, Queen Elizabeth sailed to New York on her namesake.|$|E
5|$|George Eastham, who had {{previously}} been Waddington's assistant, was appointed as manager in March 1977, but the club's <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> the Second Division in 1976–77 season proved unstoppable. Eastham did not last long, leaving in January 1978 after only 10 months in charge. The club's misery was compounded by a defeat to non-league Blyth Spartans in the FA Cup shortly afterwards. Alan Durban, arriving from Shrewsbury Town, {{was selected as the}} club's new manager in February 1978. Durban achieved promotion to the First Division in his first full season, 1978–79, with a third-place finish. After consolidating the club's position in the First Division, Durban left for Sunderland in 1981.|$|E

5|$|Neither the {{clockwork}} {{visible to}} {{the left side of the}} machine nor the drawer that housed the chess set extended fully to the rear of the cabinet; they instead went only one third of the way. A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the director inside to slide from place to place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding of the seat caused dummy machinery to <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> its place to further conceal the person inside the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The copper mines prospered {{for about}} seventy years, {{but by the}} early 17th century the {{industry}} was in decline. Demand for copper fell {{and the cost of}} extracting it was high. Graphite mining continued, and quarrying for slate began to grow in importance. Other small-scale industries grew up, such as tannery and weaving. Although the boom of the mid-16th century had finished, the town's economy did not <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> ruin, and the population remained generally constant at a little under 1,000.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} as a footballer, Wills turned to umpiring and committee work, {{and despite his}} continued <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> debt, donated money and trophies for football competitions. He served as Geelong's vice-president from 1873 to 1876, {{and was one of}} three delegates appointed by the club after the 1877 formation of the Victorian Football Association (VFA), but was dropped soon after for unknown reasons. During the 1878 VFA season, he acted as central umpire, and defended his adjudication of a June match between Carlton and Albert Park in what would be his last public letter. That year, Wills, broke and hounded by creditors, began selling land in Geelong to help clear his debt, and moved with Barbor to South Melbourne.|$|E

5|$|In 1891 Joyce wrote a poem on {{the death}} of Charles Stewart Parnell. His father was angry at the {{treatment}} of Parnell by the Catholic church, the Irish Home Rule Party and the British Liberal Party and the resulting collaborative failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The Irish Party had dropped Parnell from leadership. But the Vatican's role in allying with the British Conservative Party to prevent Home Rule left a lasting impression on the young Joyce. The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the Vatican Library. In November of that same year, John Joyce was entered in Stubbs' Gazette (a publisher of bankruptcies) and suspended from work. In 1893, John Joyce was dismissed with a pension, beginning the family's <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> poverty caused mainly by his drinking and financial mismanagement.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the baronial castles in England were affected by the economic changes during the period. During the 13th and 14th centuries the average incomes of the English barons increased but wealth became concentrated {{in the hands of}} a smaller number of individuals, with a greater discrepancy in incomes. At the same time the costs of maintaining and staffing a modern castle were increasing. The result was that although there were around 400 castles in England in 1216, the number of castles continued to diminish over the coming years; even the wealthier barons were inclined to let some castles <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> disuse and to focus their resources on the remaining stock. The castle-guard system faded into abeyance in England, being replaced by financial rents, although it continued in the Welsh Marches well into the 13th century and saw some limited use during Edward I's occupation of Scotland in the early 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E

25|$|O'Neill's plays {{were among}} the first to include speeches in American vernacular and involve {{characters}} on the fringes of society. They struggle to maintain their hopes and aspirations, but ultimately <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> disillusionment and despair. Of his very few comedies, only one is well-known (Ah, Wilderness!). Nearly all of his other plays involve some degree of tragedy and personal pessimism.|$|E

25|$|Mansa Musa was {{succeeded by}} his son in 1337, which marked the {{beginning}} of the empire’s <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> decline. Mansa Maghan ruled four years before his death, which was probably hastened by Musa’s brother Suleyman. Sometime during these four years, Mossi horsemen from the Upper Volta raided Timbuktu and surrounding cities. But the most important development of the period was Songhai's assertion of independence for good from Mali in 1340.|$|E

Ville Valo from HIM was asked to contribute vocals to this song, partly due to the need for a good clean male vocal, but mainly to have Byron portrayed by someone who may be the modern day equivalent.|$|E

25|$|On June 9, 1991, 32-year-old Candy Taylor of Toledo, Ohio, fell to {{her death}} from Flight Commander, an Intamin Flight Trainer, located at Kings Island. Investigators {{determined}} that a design flaw in the seat divider could allow a rider to <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> an unoccupied seat and become free from the restraint. A coroner's report later revealed that the victim had a blood-alcohol level of 0.30 which may have also contributed. Speculation suggests the rider lost consciousness during the ride and slid out from the restraints.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Stax's biggest star, Otis Redding, in 1967, and the {{severance}} of the label's distribution deal with Atlantic Records in 1968, Stax continued primarily {{under the supervision of}} a new co-owner, Al Bell. Over the next five years, Bell expanded the label's operations significantly, in order to compete with Stax's main rival, Motown Records in Detroit. During the mid-1970s, a number of factors, including a problematic distribution deal with CBS Records, caused the label to <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> insolvency, resulting in its forced closure in late 1975.|$|E
25|$|This belle époque {{lasted until}} the First World War, when as a {{consequence}} of hostilities, notably in Germany whence at least 40 cultivars originated, and of the outbreak {{at about the same time}} of the early strain of Dutch elm disease, Ophiostoma ulmi, the elm began its <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> horticultural decline. The devastation caused by the Second World War, and the demise in 1944 of the huge Späth nursery in Berlin, only accelerated the process. The outbreak of the new, three times more virulent, strain of Dutch elm disease Ophiostoma novo-ulmi in the late 1960s brought the tree to its nadir.|$|E
