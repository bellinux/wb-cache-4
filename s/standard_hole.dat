One row of cylindrical holes, located on the stagnation line, is investigated with two expansion levels, 2 d and 4 d, in addition to the <b>standard</b> <b>hole.</b> The air is injected at 90 o and 60 o inclination angle relative to the vane surface at four blowing ratios ranging from 1 to 2 at a 0. 9 density ratio.

The detailed local heat transfer coefficient over both the pressure side and the suction side are presented in addition to the lateral-averaged normalized heat transfer coefficient. The proposed expansion provides a lower heat transfer coefficient compared with the standard cylindrical hole over the investigated blowing ratios. Combining the heat transfer coefficient with the corresponding cooling effectiveness, previously presented, the smooth expansion shows a significant reduction in the heat load with more uniform distribution of the coolant over the leading edge region. The strong confrontation between the coolant jet and the mainstream, in case of 90 o injection, yields a strong dispersion of the coolant with higher heat transfer coefficient and high thermal load over the vane surface...|$|E

40|$|Presented in this {{dissertation}} is {{the successful}} demonstration that nonphotochemical hole burning (NPWB) imaging {{can be used}} to study in vitro tissue cellular systems for discerning differences in cellular ultrastructures due to cancer development. This has been accomplished with the surgically removed cancerous ovarian and analogous normal peritoneal tissues from the same patient and the application of a fluorescent mitochondrion specific dye, Molecular Probe MitoFluor Far Red 680 (MF 680), commonly known as rhodamine 800, that has been proven to exhibit efficient NPHB. From the results presented in Chapters 4 and 5, and Appendix B, the following conclusions were made: (1) fluorescence excitation spectra of MF 680 and confocal microscopy images of thin sliced tissues incubated with MF 680 confirm the site-specificity of the probe molecules in the cellular systems. (2) Tunneling parameters, {lambda}{sub 0 } and {sigma}{sub {lambda}}, as well as the <b>standard</b> <b>hole</b> burning parameters (namely, {gamma} and S), have been determined for the tissue samples by hole growth kinetics (HGK) analyses. Unlike the preliminary cultured cell studies, these parameters have not shown the ability to distinguish tissue cellular matrices surrounding the chromophores. (3) Effects of an external electric (Stark) field on the nonphotochemical holes have been used to determine the changes in permanent dipole moment (f{Delta}{mu}) for MF 680 in tissue samples when burn laser polarization is parallel to the Stark field. Differences are detected between f{Delta}{mu}s in the two tissue samples, with the cancerous tissue exhibiting a more pronounced change (1. 35 -fold increase) in permanent dipole moment change relative to the normal analogs. It is speculated that the difference may be related to differences in mitochondrial membrane potentials in these tissue samples. (4) In the HGK mode, hole burning imaging (HBI) of cells adhered to coverslips and cooled to liquid helium temperatures in the complete absence of cryopreservatives, shows the ability to distinguish between carcinoma and analogous normal cells on the single-cell level. In future applications, this system {{has the potential to be}} used with smears of tissue samples for single-layer HBI analysis. These conclusions demonstrate that HBI has the potential of providing detailed information about localized intracellular environments and for detecting changes in the physical characteristics (e. g., electrical properties) of cells which constitute the in vitro tissue samples. For the latter, the long-term goal will be to develop NPHB into a diagnostic technique for the early detection of cancer by exploiting the physical differences between normal and cancerous cells and tissues. Moreover, because of the aforementioned HBI's capability to detect cellular anomalies, it has the potential of being used in conjunction with studies involving photodynamic therapy, assuming the chromophore is carefully selected...|$|E
40|$|BS 1916 {{limits and}} fits for {{engineering}} {{is based on}} ISA bulletin 25 which was first issued in 1921 and designed for use with the metric system. It provides {{a wide range of}} tolerances for holes and shafts from which it is possible by suitable selection to satisfy a wide range of engineering requirements. The basic principle underlying the system is the allocation of letters to signify the magnitude of the displacement of that part of the tolerance zone which is nearest to the basic size and a number to indicate the magnitude of the tolerance. Capital letters are used for holes, small letters for shafts. The numbers referred to as fundamental tolerances are common to holes and shafts. In applying the system to inch sizes care was taken to ensure that fit combinations (H 6 /k 4) would provide the same type of fit in the inch system as was established in the metric system throughout the whole of the Size range. It was also recommended that a unilateral hole basis be adopted in which the hole is the standard member and the tolerance specified as a value from nominal to plus an amount determined. by the number signifying the magnitude of the tolerance. Different types of fit are obtained by selecting from the standard shafts available the one whose fundamental deviation from basic size is considered to be the most suitable and :allocating to it a suitable standard tolerance When ISA bulletin 25 was issued great care was taken in selecting the disposition of the sizes allocated to standard shafts so that when one standard shaft was used with one <b>standard</b> <b>hole</b> it would provide a fit which -mould be functionally similar throughout the complete range of sizes. The decision of I. S. O. and B. S. I. to extend the size range from 20 inches to 200 inches caused reasonable doubts to exist about the reliability of this simple rule that one fit combination would be functionally similar throughout the whole of the extended size range. As this problem was examined in more detail cases were found where the above rule was not satisfactory over the extended or the smaller size range covered by the original standard (0. 040 ” to 20 ”). In considering the possibility of applying theoretical analysis to this problem {{it was clear that the}} most difficult section was that concerned with the selection of clearance fits for hydrodynamically lubricated plain 'beatings. The present paper is a preliminary survey into this problem and the detailed analysis is restricted to the application of lubrication theory to the selection of what appear to be optimum clearance fits for hydrodynamically lubricated bearings and the means that may be used for comparing these results with the recommendations of I.

40|$|Soil erosion is {{a natural}} process. It becomes a problem when human {{activity}} causes it to occur much faster than under natural conditions. Soil erosion by water, wind and tillage affects both agriculture and the natural environment. Soil loss, and its associated impacts, {{is one of the}} most important of today's environmental problems. Soil erosion {{is a natural}}ly occurring process that affects all landforms. In agriculture, soil erosion refers to the wearing away of a field's topsoil by the natural physical forces of water and wind or through forces associated with farming activities such as tillage. This problem can be a slow process that continues relatively unnoticed or can occur at an alarming rate, causing serious loss of topsoil. Soil compaction, low organic matter, loss of soil structure, poor internal drainage, and soil acidity problems are other serious soil degradation conditions that can accelerate the soil erosion process. Soil quality, structure, stability and texture can be affected by the loss of soil. The breakdown of aggregates and the removal of smaller particles or entire layers of soil or organic matter can weaken the structure and even change the texture. Textural changes can in turn affect the water-holding capacity of the soil, making it more susceptible to extreme conditions. Many dam ruptures events have occurred throughout the world, some of them were reported by Foster and al. [1]. Then main cause was piping phenomenon that occurred in the foundation soil or in the dam structure. Serviceability of hydraulic infrastructures needs considering vulnerability of soil to internal erosion under the action of a seepage flow, [2, 3]. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and quantifying the effects of pertinent variables that affect this phenomenon is of great importance in order to prevent such catastrophes. In this work, the water erosion is modeled in the fluid/soil interface during the hole erosion test (HET). The Hole Erosion Test is commonly used to quantify the rate of piping erosion. The aim of this work is to predict the erosion of soil in the fluid/soil interface by using the Fluent package. This modeling makes it possible describing the effect of the flow on erosion in the interface fluid/soil by using the turbulence model equations, and predicts a non uniform erosion along the hole length unlike the usual one dimensional models or two dimensional models. In particular, the flow velocity is found to increase noticeably the erosion rate. Effects on the wall-shear stress resulting from varying flow velocity and applied hydraulic gradient are analyzed. Various parametric studies were performed and had shown that the three-dimensional modeling introduced in the present study showed that the erosion rate is not uniform along the pipe wall as observed experimentally after performing the <b>standard</b> <b>hole</b> erosion test. The aim of this study is to describe the biphasic turbulent flow at the origin of erosion taking place inside the porous soil sample by considering the influence of variation of the concentration of clay contained in the flowing fluid. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach is used to investigate the shear stress that develops at the water/soil interface and which represents the main mechanical action that causes surface erosion...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{reports the}} results of sixteen experiments of bolted slip-critical connections with fillers. Fifteen of the connections used oversized holes and one connection used <b>standard</b> <b>holes</b> to establish a baseline comparison. Such connections with oversized holes are commonly fabricated for use with structures such as long-span trusses, since the use of oversized holes allows erection in-place rather than first assessing fit-up on the ground. Filler plates are used to connect members of different depths or widths. The Specification for Structural Steel Buildings of the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC, 2005) currently requires connections with oversized holes to be designed as slip-critical at what is termed the ???required strength level,??? for which a resistance factor (LRFD) ?? of 0. 85 and a safety factor ?? (ASD) of 1. 76 are specified. These slip strengths are typically below values {{that had been used}} for years in the Specification for Structural Steel Buildings: Allowable Stress Design and Plastic Design (AISC, 1989). In addition, when fillers are used in these connections, the AISC (2005) provisions do not require changes in the strength calculations, whereas if <b>standard</b> <b>holes</b> are used, options are provided for connection design that include reduction of the bolt shear strength or development of the connection. The sixteen experiments reported herein highlight the behavior of bolted steel connections with oversized holes in which fillers are included and are undeveloped, partially developed, or fully developed.

Extensive instrumentation was used on the specimens to document the flow of forces through the connection.

Although the temperature vanishes in the extremal limit where the radii of the two horizons coincide with each other as in the <b>standard</b> multi-horizon black <b>hole</b> like the Reissner-Nordström black hole or the Kerr black hole, the larger temperature corresponds to the larger horizon radius.
