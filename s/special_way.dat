5|$|A {{defining}} and best-known {{feature of the}} Mortal Kombat series is its finishing move system called Fatality. An original idea behind it was to give gamers a free hit {{at the end of}} the fight. The basic Fatalities are finishing moves that allow the victorious characters to end a match in a <b>special</b> <b>way</b> by murdering their defeated, defenseless opponents in a gruesome manner, usually in the predefined ways exclusive for the given character. The only exception from this is Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing the players to perform their own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that is common for all characters.|$|E
5|$|Twentieth-century Reformed theologian Karl Barth did {{not follow}} the Reformed belief that sacraments are used by God as means of grace. Instead, he saw the Lord's Supper as purely {{symbolic}} and functioning to proclaim God's promises. His position has been called symbolic memorialism because he saw the sacraments function as memorializing Christ's death. Another twentieth-century Reformed theologian, Donald Baillie, took a position {{similar to that of}} John Calvin. Baillie argued that though God is omnipresent, he is present in a <b>special</b> <b>way</b> in the Lord's Supper because he is present by virtue of the believer's faith. Christ's presence is even more real to the believer in the sacrament than is physical reality.|$|E

25|$|The Mint {{could not}} find a {{suitable}} metal which was sufficiently different in colour to the existing coins and which would not tarnish. This last point was thought to be important because the new coin would be the most valuable coin in general circulation in the world (about £8.40 in today's values). It therefore had to be a different shape; various methods had been used overseas to overcome this problem but none were without drawbacks. A hole through the coin did unacceptable things to the Queen's head (which is a legal requirement on British coins), and wavy-edged, flat-edged or square coins could not be used in the coin-handling machinery which was then coming into increasing use in industry, banking and vending. To be used in a vending or sorting machine a coin would have to roll under gravity and be capable of being measured without being presented in a <b>special</b> <b>way,</b> in other words it needed a constant breadth at whichever angle it was measured.|$|E

500|$|As the Chronologia {{was going}} to press in 1569, Mercator also {{published}} {{what was to become}} his most famous map: Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata (A new and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation). As mariners had started to explore the oceans in the Age of Discovery the problem of accurate navigation had become more pressing. Their locations could be a hundred miles out after a long voyage because a course of constant direction at sea (a rhumb line) did not correspond to a straight line on their chart. Mercator's solution was to make the scale of his chart increase with latitude in a very <b>special</b> <b>way</b> such that the rhumb lines became straight lines on his new world map. Exactly how he arrived at the required solution is not recorded in any of his own written works but modern scholars [...] suggest that he used the tables of rhumbs devised by Pedro Nunes. The large size of what was a wall map meant that it did not find favour for use on board ship but, within a hundred years of its creation, the Mercator Projection became the standard for marine charts throughout the world and continues to be so used to the present day. At a later stage this mariner's map became a general purpose map of the world although its distortion at high latitudes was abundantly evident. Usage other than for marine charts is now deprecated and more suitable projections are available.|$|E
500|$|The club {{returned}} to Serie A after gaining promotion in the 1999–2000 season, though after a closely contested relegation battle, they were relegated immediately {{back down the}} following season. They failed to gain promotion following this and slipped further down. The failed 2001–02 Serie B campaign was costly, the cost of production was €70,895,838, just about €10million fewer than in 2000–01 Serie A, heavily due to the high amortisation of the player asset (€33,437,075). However, value of production was just €21,183736 (excluding player profit) and the net loss was €28,856,093 that season. Net asset on 30 June 2002 was €2,166,997, already including about €20million recapitalisation. The club once quoted the law [...] "21 February 2003 No.27" [...] to lower the amortisation expense by extending the amortisation period beyond the contract length of players to 10-year (UEFA ruled the Italian special law was not lawful and all club should use IFRS standards, thus causing a re-capitalization crisis in 2006), which some players contract (with a total residual accounting value of €46,601,225) was amortise in <b>special</b> <b>way</b> for €4,660,123 only and the rest for €1,659,088 in 2002–03, however the cost of production was still exceed the value of production for €19,071,218 in 2002–03.
