5|$|A 2001 {{report by}} Newell et al. at Southampton University {{undertaken}} for Studio Sound in 2001 {{found that the}} NS-10 had excellent time-domain response at low frequencies – its ability to start and stop in response to <b>signal</b> <b>input</b> {{was found to be}} superior to that of most other nearfield monitors. Part of this was related to its closed-box design. The researchers held that the extremely fast decay time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that the bass instruments (guitar and drums) are correctly balanced in the mix.|$|E
25|$|The {{output of}} a given {{microphone}} delivers the same power whether it is low or high impedance. If a microphone is made in high and low impedance versions, the high impedance version has a higher output voltage for a given sound pressure input, and is suitable for use with vacuum-tube guitar amplifiers, for instance, which have a high input impedance and require a relatively high <b>signal</b> <b>input</b> voltage to overcome the tubes' inherent noise. Most professional microphones are low impedance, about 200Ω or lower. Professional vacuum-tube sound equipment incorporates a transformer that steps up the impedance of the microphone circuit to the high impedance and voltage needed to drive the input tube. External matching transformers are also available {{that can be used}} in-line between a low impedance microphone and a high impedance input.|$|E
500|$|The 147 is the [...] "universal" [...] {{version of}} the 122, {{designed}} for many organs, and has a different amplifier input and motor speed control, but is otherwise identical. The <b>signal</b> <b>input</b> is unbalanced, allowing a simpler connection to organs that have a built-in speaker system, such as the Hammond A100, or a Wurlitzer. The motor speed switching uses a separate AC signal, rather than the DC voltage control of the 122. In operation, the noticeable differences between the 122 and the 147 are the 122's lower susceptibility to induced noise, and a delay between operation of the speed control and the actual change in speed. As with the 122 and 142, the 145 {{is identical to the}} 147, except that it is housed in a [...] cabinet, and thus slightly easier to move. As with the 122, Hammond-Suzuki manufactures a modern replacement, the 147A. The model X-77, released in 1968, was designed to accompany Hammond's new tonewheel / transistor organ, the X-66. It contained seven different tab controls and six speakers. It has a completely different interface from other Leslies, using a 12-pin amphenol connector.|$|E

5000|$|In {{evaluating}} the SiTF curve, the <b>signal</b> <b>input</b> and signal output are measured differentially; meaning, the differential of the input signal and differential of the output signal are calculated and plotted against each other. An operator, using computer software, defines an arbitrary area, with a given {{set of data}} points, within the signal and background regions of the output image of the infrared sensor, i.e. of the Unit Under Test (UUT), (see [...] "Half Moon" [...] image below). The average signal and background are calculated by averaging the data of each arbitrarily defined region. A second order polynomial curve is fitted to the data of each line. Then, the polynomial is subtracted from the average signal and background data to yield the new signal and background. The difference of the new signal and background data is taken to yield the net signal. Finally, the net signal is plotted versus the <b>signal</b> <b>input.</b> The <b>signal</b> <b>input</b> of the UUT is within its own spectral response. (e.g. color-correlated temperature, pixel intensity, etc.). The slope of the linear portion of this curve is then found using the method of least squares.|$|E

40|$|PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To improve {{distortion}} compensation {{accuracy of}} a power amplifier. SOLUTION: An LMS algorithm using a feedback signal that is an output signal {{of a power}} amplifier 1 input via an attenuator 17 and pseudorandom data calculates a delay of an <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> to the power amplifier 1 and a delay of the feedback signal. Specifically, the delays of the <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> and feedback signal are calculated such that the delay of the <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> is only an integer delay. An <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> to the power amplifier 1 is adjusted {{on the basis of}} the calculated delay, and a delay of a feedback signal is adjusted by an analog delay stage 41. Since the delay of the <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> is only an integer delay, a more accurate adjustment of the delay of the <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> matches the <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> with the feedback signal with higher accuracy to improve DPD mode distortion compensation accuracy...|$|R
