Researchers explain that subjects have the tendency to seek and select information using their integrative model.

Methods: Four different models of pacemakers were examined to select the pacemaker generating oversensing. To the pacemaker with oversensing, intermittent switching X-ray was exposed using ECG-gated CT helical scan system at prospective CTA mode. IVY Model was used to synchronize the ECG. Only during in the alert period that is non-refractory and sensing is available, intermittent switching X-ray (300 msec/sec) was exposed in chest CT. For comparison, the same intermittent switching X-ray (300 msec/sec) was exposed in the refractory period when sensing was not available. Re-sults: Oversensing was detected only in one of the four pacemakers tested. In this pacemaker, oversensing was gener-ated by exposure of the intermittent switching X-ray in the alert (non-refractory) period, but oversensing was not ob-served in the refractory period. Conclusion: A pacemaker has alert and refractory periods. Oversensing of a pacemaker was found to be inhibited by <b>selective</b> ECG-synchronized <b>exposure</b> in the refractory period.

However, cellular targets and molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Methods: Genioglossus (GG) muscle tissues and MDSCs were derived from SHAM, ovariectomized or ovariectomized and 17 β-estradiol injected rats (n= 10 ⁄ group). ERα, ERβ, MHC expression and underlying regulatory mechanisms were investigated by RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry, inter alia upon <b>selective</b> antagonist <b>exposure</b> and Si-RNA transfection. MDSC viability and cell cycle were examined by MTT and flow cytometry. Results: E 2 upregulated MHC-I and downregulated MHC-IIb expression in MDSCs. E 2 mediated effects on these molecules were inhibited by ERα-selective antagonist MPP and si-ERα, whereas they persisted upon exposure to ERβ-selective antagonist PHTPP. ERα was significantly higher expressed in muscle tissues compared to ERβ. ER positive stainings were fewer in the ovariectomized than in the SHAM group. Injection of E 2 only increased the positive staining of ERα, but not of ERβ. Conclusion: Results suggest that E 2 regulates MHC expression mainly through an ERα-mediated pathway with opposing effects on MHC-I and MHC-IIb. Thus, different hormonal processes that impact muscular pathophysiology presumably govern the functional properties of these molecules...|$|R
5000|$|Politics {{are more}} likely to inspire <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> among {{consumers}} as opposed to single exposure decisions. For example, in their 2009 meta-analysis of <b>Selective</b> <b>Exposure</b> Theory, Hart et al. reported that [...] "A 2004 survey by The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press (2006) found that Republicans are about 1.5 times more likely to report watching Fox News regularly than are Democrats (34% for Republicans and 20% of Democrats). In contrast, Democrats are 1.5 times more likely to report watching CNN regularly than Republicans (28% of Democrats vs. 19% of Republicans). Even more striking, Republicans are approximately five times more likely than Democrats to report watching [...] "The O'Reilly Factor" [...] regularly and are seven times more likely to report listening to [...] "Rush Limbaugh" [...] regularly." [...] As a result, when the opinions of Republicans who only tune into conservative media outlets were compared to those of their fellow conservatives in a study by Stroud (2010), their beliefs were considered to be more polarized. The same result was retrieved from the study of liberals as well. Due to our greater tendency toward <b>selective</b> <b>exposure,</b> current political campaigns have been characterized as being extremely partisan and polarized. As Bennett and Iyengar (2008) commented, [...] "The new, more diversified information environment makes it not only more feasible for consumers to seek out news they might find agreeable but also provides a strong economic incentive for news organizations to cater to their viewers' political preferences." [...] <b>Selective</b> <b>exposure</b> thus plays a role in shaping and reinforcing individuals' political attitudes. In early research, <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> originally provided an explanation for limited media effects. The [...] "limited effects" [...] model of communication emerged in the 1940s with a shift in the media effects paradigm. This shift suggested that while the media has effects on consumers' behavior such as their voting behavior, these effects are limited and influenced indirectly by interpersonal discussions and the influence of opinion leaders. <b>Selective</b> <b>exposure</b> was considered one necessary function in the early studies of media's limited power over citizens' attitudes and behaviors. Political ads deal with <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> as well because people {{are more likely}} to favor a politician that agrees with their own beliefs. Another significant effect of <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> comes from Stroud (2010) who analyzed the relationship between partisan <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> and political polarization. Using data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey, analysts found that over time partisan <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> leads to polarization. This process is plausible because people can easily create or have access to blogs, websites, chats, and online forums where those with similar views and political ideologies can congregate. Much of the research has also shown that political interaction online tends to be polarized. Further evidence for this polarization in the political blogosphere can be found in the Lawrence et al. (2010)'s study on blog readership that people tend to read blogs that reinforce rather than challenge their political beliefs. According to Cass Sunstein's book, Republic.com, the presence of <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> on the web creates an environment that breeds political polarization and extremism. Due to easy access to social media and other online resources, people are [...] " [...] likely to hold even stronger views than the ones they started with, and when these views are problematic, they are likely to manifest increasing hatred toward those espousing contrary beliefs." [...] This illustrates how <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> can influence an individual's political beliefs and subsequently his participation in the political system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>exposure</b> {{can affect}} the {{decisions}} people make as individuals or as groups because they may be unwilling to change their views and beliefs either collectively or on their own. A historical example of the disastrous effects of <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> {{and its effects on}} group dynamics is the series of events leading up to the Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961. President John F. Kennedy was given the go ahead by his advisers to authorize the invasion of Cuba by poorly trained expatriates despite overwhelming evidence that it was a foolish and ill-conceived tactical maneuver. The advisers were so eager to please the President that they confirmed their cognitive bias for the invasion rather than challenging the faulty plan. Changing beliefs about one's self, other people, and the world are three variables as to why people fear new information. A variety of studies has shown that <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> effects can occur in the context of both individual and group decision making. Numerous situational variables have been identified that increase the tendency toward <b>selective</b> <b>exposure.</b> Social psychology, specifically, includes research with a variety of situational factors and related psychological processes that eventually persuade a person to make a quality decision. Additionally, from a psychological perspective, the effects of <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> can both stem from motivational and cognitive accounts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>exposure</b> avoids {{information}} {{inconsistent with}} one's beliefs and attitudes. For example, former Vice President Dick Cheney would only enter {{a hotel room}} after the television was turned on and tuned to a conservative television channel. When analyzing a person's decision-making skills, his or her unique process of gathering relevant information {{is not the only}} factor taken into account. Fischer et al. (2010) found it important to consider the information source itself, otherwise explained as the physical being that provided the source of information. <b>Selective</b> <b>exposure</b> research generally neglects the influence of indirect decision-related attributes, such as physical appearance. In Fischer et al. (2010) two studies hypothesized that physically attractive information sources resulted in decision makers to be more selective in searching and reviewing decision-relevant information. Researchers explored the impact of social information and its level of physical attractiveness. The data was then analyzed and used to support the idea that <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> existed for those who needed to make a decision. Therefore, the more attractive an information source was, the more positive and detailed the subject was with making the decision. Physical attractiveness affects an individual's decision because the perception of quality improves. Physically attractive information sources increased the quality of consistent information needed to make decisions and further increased the <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> in decision-relevant information, supporting the researchers' hypothesis. Both studies concluded that attractiveness is driven by a different selection and evaluation of decision-consistent information. Decision makers allow factors such as physical attractiveness to affect everyday decisions due to the works of selective exposure.In another study, <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> was defined by the amount of individual confidence. Individuals can control the amount of <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> depending on whether they have a low self-esteem or high self-esteem. Individuals who maintain higher confidence levels reduce the amount of <b>selective</b> <b>exposure.</b> Albarracín and Mitchell (2004) hypothesized that those who displayed higher confidence levels were more willing to seek out information both consistent and inconsistent with their views. The phrase [...] "decision-consistent information" [...] explains the tendency to actively seek decision-relevant information. <b>Selective</b> <b>exposure</b> occurs when individuals search for information and show systematic preferences towards ideas that are consistent, rather than inconsistent, with their beliefs. On the contrary, those who exhibited low levels of confidence were more inclined to examine information that did not agree with their views. The researchers found that in three out of five studies participants showed more confidence and scored higher on the Defensive Confidence Scale, which serves as evidence that their hypothesis was correct.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEukaryotic gene {{activation}} requires selective unfolding of the chromatin fiber {{to access the}} DNA for processes such as DNA transcription, replication, and repair. Mutation/modification experiments of linker histone (LH) H 1 suggest the importance of dynamic mechanisms for LH binding/dissociation, but the effects on chromatin's unfolding pathway remain unclear. Here we investigate the stretching response of chromatin fibers by mesoscale modeling to complement single-molecule experiments, and present various unfolding mechanisms for fibers with different nucleosome repeat lengths (NRLs) with/without LH that are fixed to their cores or bind/unbind dynamically with different affinities. Fiber softening occurs for long compared to short NRL (due to facile stacking rearrangements), dynamic compared to static LH/core binding as well as slow rather than fast dynamic LH rebinding (due to DNA stem destabilization), and low compared to high LH concentration (due to DNA stem inhibition). Heterogeneous superbead constructs—nucleosome clusters interspersed with extended fiber regions—emerge during unfolding of medium-NRL fibers and {{may be related to}} those observed experimentally. Our work suggests that fast and slow LH binding pools, present simultaneously in vivo, might act cooperatively to yield controlled fiber unfolding at low forces. Medium-NRL fibers with multiple dynamic LH pools offer both flexibility and <b>selective</b> DNA <b>exposure,</b> and may be evolutionarily suitable to regulate chromatin architecture and gene expression...|$|R
40|$|How {{will people}} use the Internet and other {{emerging}} {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) to shape their exposure to political information? Will Internet users be inclined to fashion an information environment that reflects their own political predispositions, or will they continue to encounter a range of perspectives online? In this talk Garrett addresses these questions using two interconnected research projects. The first project uses nationally representative survey data to examine how contemporary use of the Internet is influencing citizens' overall exposure to political information. The second project focuses on individual choices about exposure to news items in an online environment that affords enhanced control over partisanship. Taken together, these projects clarify the contemporary dynamic of <b>selective</b> political <b>exposure,</b> providing evidence about citizens' underlying preferences regarding political information. The results suggest that individuals' preference for support and their aversion to challenge are different. People (1) seek out sources that support their viewpoints; (2) are interested in news items with which they agree; and (3) use online sources to increase their repertoire of opinion-supporting arguments. They do not, however, systematically exclude exposure to other viewpoints. Ultimately, this research suggests that individuals value awareness of other perspectives, while simultaneously wanting to limit their contact with them...|$|R

To derive similarly robust systems that are more reducing in nature, our group has developed a versatile family of electron-rich Ru and Os systems supported by anionic triand bidentate (quinolinyl) amido ligands.

50|$|This {{new model}} {{combines}} the motivational and cognitive processes of <b>selective</b> <b>exposure.</b> In the past, <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> had been studied from a motivational standpoint. For instance, the reason behind {{the existence of}} <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> was that people felt motivated to decrease the level of dissonance they felt while encountering inconsistent information. They also felt motivated to defend their decisions and positions, so they achieved this goal by exposing themselves to consistent information only. However, the new cognitive economy model not only {{takes into account the}} motivational aspects, but it also focuses on the cognitive processes of each individual. For instance, this model proposes that people cannot evaluate the quality of inconsistent information objectively and fairly because they tend to store more of the consistent information and use this as their reference point. Thus, inconsistent information is often observed with a more critical eye in comparison to consistent information. According to this model, the levels of <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> experienced during the decision-making process are also dependent on how much cognitive energy people are willing to invest. Just as people tend to be careful with their finances, cognitive energy or how much time they are willing to spend evaluating all the evidence for their decisions works the same way. People are hesitant to use this energy; they tend to be careful so they don't waste it. Thus, this model suggests that <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> does not happen in separate stages. Rather, it is a combined process of the individuals' certain acts of motivations and their management of the cognitive energy.|$|E
50|$|According to {{research}} study by Fischer, Schulz-Hardt, et al. (2008), {{the quantity of}} decision-relevant information that the participants were exposed to {{had a significant effect}} on their levels of <b>selective</b> <b>exposure.</b> A group for which only two pieces of decision-relevant information were given had experienced lower levels of <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> than the other group who had ten pieces of information to evaluate. This research brought more attention to the cognitive processes of individuals when they are presented with a very small amount of decision-consistent and decision-inconsistent information. The study showed that in situations such as this, an individual becomes more doubtful of their initial decision due to the unavailability of resources. They begin to think that there is not enough data or evidence in this particular field in which they are told to make a decision about. Because of this, the subject becomes more critical of their initial thought process and focuses on both decision-consistent and inconsistent sources, thus decreasing his level of <b>selective</b> <b>exposure.</b> For the group who had plentiful pieces of information, this factor made them confident in their initial decision because they felt comfort from the fact that their decision topic was well-supported by a large number of resources. Therefore, the availability of decision-relevant and irrelevant information surrounding individuals can influence the level of <b>selective</b> <b>exposure</b> experienced during the process of decision-making.|$|E

40|$|European honeybees were {{introduced}} to Australia in the 1820 s and are now widespread as feral and domestic colonies in the temperate region, foraging for nectar and pollen from plants {{in at least two}} hundred genera. Many of the plant species visited by honeybees are among the nearly 1, 000 species that have floral structures that facilitate pollination by birds or mammals. Numerous ecologists have expressed concerns that the pollination systems of such plants, which evolved in the absence of winged social insects, are at risk of disruption by honeybees, particularly because anthers, nectaries and/or stigmas are often separated by several centimetres. At the same time, honeybee industry advocates continue to argue for greater access to natural areas, citing a lack of evidence of negative impacts. To date, experimental studies of potential honeybee disruption of Australian pollination systems have produced a range of outcomes apparently demonstrating that honeybees can enhance, decrease or have little effect on the quantity of fruit or seed produced in different vertebrate-adapted species. Less apparently, honeybees m a y be altering plant fitness by reducing seed quality. Such an effect would be expected if short-distance honeybee movement facilitate geitonogamy and inbreeding in contrast to longer-distance movements by native pollinators. As a result, honeybees could be expected to be a significant evolutionary pressure for some plant species. A comparative approach is needed to determine what types of pollination systems are most at risk of negative honeybee effects such as severe reproductive decline or inbreeding depression. In this study, I compared the roles of honeybees and native animal visitors in the pollination ecology of bird- and insect-adapted plant species using confamilial pairs of plant species in three plant families: Callistemon citrinus and Baeckea imbricata (Myrtaceae); Styphelia tubiflora and Epacris microphylla (Epacridaceae); and Grevillea acanthifolia and G. sphacelata (Proteaceae). In all six species, I identified the suites of probable pollinators and observed their foraging behaviour at flowers and among plants. I compared the proportion of flowers that produced fruit among <b>selective</b> pollination <b>exposure</b> treatments - exclusion of birds, exclusion of all pollinators, and open pollination - to deduce the likely role of honeybees. In the Epacridaceae and Proteaceae, I determined if plants were self-compatible and compared fruit set of manually pollinated flowers with that of open flowers to determine if plants were pollinator limited. Finally, in order to determine whether honeybees may be reducing seed quality, I compared seed produced from <b>selective</b> pollinator <b>exposures</b> for viability and genriination rate (in Callistemon citrinus) and outcrossing rate (in Grevillea acanthifolia). Overall, {{the results of this study}} did not support the hypothesis that pollination of bird-adapted plants by honeybees alone would produce less fruit than open pollination. Rather, fruit set in such species following exposure to honeybees alone was equivalent (Callistemon citrinus), marginally lower (Grevillea acanthifolia) or higher (Styphelia tubiflora) than fruit set following exposure to both honeybees and birds. The last outcome appeared to be an artefact of the exclusion cages, which excluded native bird nectar robbers; such birds appeared to be responsible for damaging more than 60...|$|R

Prior <b>exposure</b> of an area to flicker, decreased the effectiveness of a cueing spot presented later at that location. This effect lasted for at least 1. 5 s. In further experiments, it was found that both static and flickering cues, with time, lose their effectiveness to facilitate processing. While the static cueing decays quickly to very low effectiveness, flicker cueing decays to a level of effectiveness which can be maintained for a long time. Thus with time two flickering cues presented with a temporal offset become equivalent to each other, but remain more effective than a static cue. We conclude that mechanisms coding temporal change determine cue effectiveness for capturing attention. Simple exponential decay functions with different temporal constants and different lower asymptotes can describe these effects...|$|R
