40|$|This {{work was}} {{conducted}} during {{spring and summer}} 2012 together with the company Uppsala Academy of Management as the principal. The two main objectives for the work are that: • Make a comparison between the measured volume in the standing forest and the measured volume at the industry on Uppsala Academy of Managements actual <b>stumpage</b> <b>sale</b> volume {{to see how well}} it conforms. • Examine if the buyers see any particular advantages or disadvantages of actual <b>stumpage</b> <b>sale</b> volume and what they think of Uppsala Academy of Managements actual <b>stumpage</b> <b>sale</b> volume and structure in general. I chose to use actual <b>stumpage</b> <b>sale</b> volume from the tree years 2009, 2010 and 2011 in my work. I divided the actual <b>stumpage</b> <b>sale</b> volume following four categories which was pine, spruce, pine/spruce and seed trees. After that I picked out sixteen actual <b>stumpage</b> <b>sale</b> volumes from each category {{to be a part of}} the work. When I selected the actual <b>stumpage</b> <b>sale</b> volume to be included in the work I contacted the buyers to get access to the measured volume. To make the study of the buyers opinion about Uppsala Academy of Managements actual <b>stumpage</b> <b>sale</b> volume and structure in general I sent out eight questions that I together with Uppsala Academy of Management decided. This work shows that the measured volume at the standing forest and the measured volume at the industry align very well with only a difference of 616 m 3 solid wood under bark or 0. 6 percent The responses received from the buyers to the questions I sent out can shortly be summarized with that the advantages of the actual <b>stumpage</b> <b>sale</b> volume is that they are fully planned and ready to be harvested. The disadvantage of the actual <b>stumpage</b> <b>sale</b> volume is that they often get expensive for the buyers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{influence}} of the behavior of the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management on effective public policy toward the national forests. It shows that fluctuations in <b>stumpage</b> <b>sales</b> from such forests have been large. Furthermore, those fluctuations could well {{have a significant impact on}} the price elasticity of harvest even with large stocks of uncut volume under contract. System analysis of harvest and sale patterns in nine regions during the period 1951 - 1992 shows that <b>stumpage</b> <b>sales</b> displayed little correlation with prices during the period; the positive price elasticity of harvest seems to have been induced largely by the behavior of logging firms. However, it finds a positive link between National Forest budgets and annual sales. If budget appropriations had been negatively correlated with stumpage prices, the price elasticity of harvest from federal forests could have been severely damped. ...|$|R
5000|$|In April, 1889, The Northern Pacific Railroad sold 80,000 {{acres of}} timber land in Pierce County, Washington, to a Wisconsin-Minnesota syndicate. All {{of the land}} was within 30 miles of Tacoma. The {{contract}} of sale involved {{the construction of a}} railroad {{to be known as the}} Tacoma Southern which was to be used to get the timber to tidewater. This road was to become part of NP by <b>stumpage</b> <b>sales.</b> The cost of the land was $11 per acre and it was estimated that the first few years 60% of the 75,000,000 board feet would be east the NP. During 1888, after preliminary surveys in August, an eight-mile branch from Orting, on the Tacoma-Seattle line to Lake Kapowsin was built. The charter actually was that of the Tacoma, Orting and Southeastern and Operations began by the NP on June 24th, 1889. It was called [...] "Whitesell's Crossing" [...] because the railroad ran right through the Whitesell property.|$|R

40|$|Rotation as {{the planned}} average {{production}} {{period of a}} management unit within the age-class system, and as a central control value for the forest enterprise, {{has always been a}} key factor of forest sustainability. It determines, for instance, growing stock, timber yield, tree dimensions and economic success. As a consequence of changes in sawmilling technology, price relations between dimensional assortments of Norway spruce, which is Austria's most abundant tree species, have altered in favour of small diameter logs at least for medium and low quality timber. This trend has been accompanied by advantages in the efficiency of fully mechanised timber harvesting technology for smaller dimension timber in particular. Sawmills have turned to forestry with the request to provide small diameter logs and reduce the production period. Thus, the question arose as to whether a shortening of rotation would make sense in mountainous regions as well. As early as in the 1990 s a first comprehensive analysis of possible consequences of the aforementioned changes for the rotation period of highest income from the forest {{came to the conclusion that}} shortening the rotation period would not be recommendable (Jöbstl, 1997). A more recent study was designed to consider also the changes of the past 15 Â years and compare the results with those of the former study. For calculating the net income and its components - contribution margin I (<b>stumpage</b> value; <b>sales</b> revenue minus logging costs) and contribution margin II (stumpage minus costs of silvicultural measures) - the stand development and stand valuation program FOWISIM was applied. The timber prices used were based on forest statistics and expert consultations. Newly available timber harvesting productivity models were integrated into the simulation model. The consequences of changes in the rotation period (decrease and increase) for the sustainability of the enterprise (felling quantities, growing stock, income, etc.) are demonstrated by means of the dynamic transition model FOBSI. Both models applied are deterministic ones with some stochastic elements and cover time increments of 1 or 10 Â years. The conclusions of the first study - no reduction of rotation periods - have been fully confirmed by the recent study. The model simulations showed only small differences between the net income values around the maximum value, which offers a wide range of two or three decades for the choice of the rotation. The development of price relations for dimensional assortments and logging cost relations tends to reduce the optimum length of rotation, while a decreasing timber price level increases the optimum rotation period. However, the changes of the examined factors (i. e. price relations, price level, and logging costs) over the last two decades have not been big enough to give any reason for decreasing or increasing the rotation period.

40|$|The {{operation}} {{environment in}} the roundwood trade in Finland in the 1990 ’s include several changes. They are changes {{in the structure of}} non-industrial private forest (NIPF) ownership, forest taxation, in forest legislation, in price recommendation agreement, diminishing resources of forestry extension services, etc. At the same time, the roundwood demand has been rising. All these developments cause uncertainty in wood procurement organisations, and call for research {{to find out how to}} adapt into the changing environment. The objective of this study is to produce information for roundwood purchasing planning and cus-tomer satisfaction management to be used by Stora Enso Metsä Customer Service, Helsinki. For this pur-pose, data needs to be gathered about the urban NIPFs and their forest estates, behaviour related to forestry and timber-selling, customer satisfaction in their latest timber selling transaction, and their opinions about Enso’s new customer service office and its service concept. To fulfil the objective of the study, a NIPF -owner -survey (N= 1064, response rate 39, 7 %) was con-ducted in October 1998 -January 1999. The sample was made on the basis of the marketing database of Stora Enso Oyj Forest Customer Service in Helsinki. In planning the frame of reference of the empirical study, the model of service quality by Grönroos was applied. The following aspects were included in the 7 -page questionnaire: demographic, sosio-economic and forest estate background, relation to the forest service supply, behaviour related to forestry, timber-selling motives and behaviour, last contact organisation and its image in forestry business, expectations and percep-tions in the latest timber-selling transactions, and behavioural intentions. The results revealed that the share of women, pensioners and academically educated people among forest owners was quite high. The majority of the forest estates of the metropolitan forest owners were situ-ated in the provinces of South Finland and East Finland. The average forest estate area was considerably smaller than in a previous study. Economic and recreational objectives were most important in the use of forests. Forest Associations were involved in half of the roundwood sales transactions of the respondents in the metropolitan area. The wood quantity of transactions was considerably higher than the average in the whole country. Bank-organised forest-related activities, taxation infos and trips to the forest were the most popular activities. Among the services, silvicultural advices were needed mostly and stub treatment least. Brochure material related to <b>stumpage</b> timber <b>sales</b> and taxation were considered most important compared to material related to delivery sales. The service expectations were at highest for women and they were less satisfied with the service than men. 2 nd and 3 rd generation residents of the metropolitan area thought about the new customer service concept more positively than the 1 st generation residents. Internet users under 60 years thought more positively about new satellite picture-based woodlot search concept. Cross-tabulation of factor scores against background variables indicated that women with relatively low education level a greater need to sell roundwood than entrepreneurs, white-collar workers and directors, and Internet users. Suspiciousness towards timber procurement organisations was relatively strong among women and those whose forest income share of the total income was either null or over 20 %. The average customer satisfaction score was negative in all nine questions. Statistical differences be-tween different companies did not exist in the average satisfaction scores. Stora Enso’s Helsinki forest cus-tomer service could choose the ability to purchase all timber grades as its competitive advantage. Out of nine service dimension included in the questionnaire, in this particular service dimension, Enso’s Helsinki forest customer service’s score exceeded most all organisations’ average customer satisfaction score. On the basis of importance – performance matrix, advice and quidance could have been provided more to the forest owners in their latest timber–selling transaction...|$|R
