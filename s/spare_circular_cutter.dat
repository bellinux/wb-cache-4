5000|$|Milling {{machines}} {{evolved from}} the practice of rotary filing—that is, running a <b>circular</b> <b>cutter</b> with file-like teeth in the headstock of a lathe. Rotary filing and, later, true milling were developed to reduce time and effort spent hand-filing. The full story of milling machine development may never be known, because much early development took place in individual shops where few records were kept for posterity. However, the broad outlines are known, as summarized below. From a history-of-technology viewpoint, {{it is clear that}} the naming of this new type of machining with the term [...] "milling" [...] was an extension from that word's earlier senses of processing materials by abrading them in some way (cutting, grinding, crushing, etc.).|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Circular</b> <b>cutters</b> with uniform radial cracks are {{extensively}} used in {{the cutting}} processes. Unwanted noise, vibration & accidental failure associated with the cutting process have become an important economic and technological problem in the industry. The knowledge of natural frequencies of components is of great interest {{in the study of}} response of structures to various excitations. Hence, it is important to study a <b>circular</b> tile <b>cutter</b> with central hole, which fixed at inner edge and free at outer edge with its dynamic response. In this study some efforts are taken for analyzing vibration characteristics of tile cutter used in tile cutting industries with free boundary condition but having different (enlargement of stress concentration holes, slot end hole diameter,numbers of cutting teeth’s, aspect ratio, effect of number and length of cracks, variable radial slit, circular concentric slit, thickness).

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for testing the tensile strength and bonding strength of sprayed-on foam insulation attached to metal cryogenic fuel tanks is described. A <b>circular</b> <b>cutter</b> {{is used to}} cut the insulation down {{to the surface of}} the metal tank to form plugs of the insulation for testing in situ on the tank. The apparatus comprises an electromechanical pulling device powered by a belt battery pack. The pulling device comprises a motor driving a mechanical pulling structure comprising a horizontal shaft connected to two bell cracks which are connected to a central member. When the lower end of member is attached to a fitting, which in turn is bonded to a plug, a pulling force is exerted on the plug sufficient to rupture it. The force necessary to rupture the plug or pull it loose is displayed as a digital read-out...|$|R
50|$|Initial designs envisaged a large <b>circular</b> <b>cutter</b> the {{diameter}} of the trench to be dug and operating in the manner of modern tunnel boring machines. However, the design evolved to a more efficient arrangement with a huge plough removing the top 2 ft of soil and a cutting cylinder rotating perpendicular to the line of the trench for digging out the lower 2 ft. The trench profile was then squared off by a number of blades. The spoil was deposited {{on either side of the}} trench, wings on the plough blade pushing the spoil away from the edge of the trench to prevent it from falling back in. Hopkins presented this conception together with a static model to Churchill via Sir Stanley Goodall. Churchill approved the scheme and gave permission for development of a prototype to begin with an initial grant of £1,000,000.|$|R

5000|$|Woodruff {{keys are}} semi{{circular}}, fitting partly into a circular segment keyway {{with the remainder}} fitting into a longitudinal slot keyway in the mating part. The circular segment can be cut directly by plunge cutting with a <b>circular</b> Woodruff <b>cutter</b> without any reliefs. The main advantage of the Woodruff key is the elimination of milling near shaft shoulders, where stress concentrations, and concentricity would be affected. [...] The latter is particularly important for high speed operation. The more exact fit of the key and keyway also reduces play, and stress concentrations in, and improves {{the reliability of the}} key. Common applications include machine tools, automotive applications, snowblowers and marine propellers.|$|R
40|$|Tunnel boring {{machines}} (TBM) utilize cutter discs {{as a primary}} tool for cutting through hard rock. The discs are mounted on a rotating, <b>circular</b> <b>cutter</b> head which is pressed against the rock. A microscopical examination of worn cutter discs has been carried out. The goal was to map fracture mechanisms on TBM cutters with different reason of change, position on the cutter head and rock mass involved. Testing was performed on samples from a full scale TBM and from a novel test method for cutter wear assessments on hard rock tunnel boring recently developed by NTNU. This method is called the Rolling Indentation Abrasion Test (RIAT). The mode of contact for TBM cutters {{was found to be}} rolling, while RIAT mini-cutters cutters also experienced a minor sliding component. Abrasive wear was dominant in both sample types. An increase in fatigue wear was seen in TBM cutters as rock abrasivity decreased. This was credited longer cutter life and larger fluctuation in load. The presence of nanocrystalline deformation layers of comparable thickness in both sample types indicate similar deformation in the two processes. A furnace test on undeformed TBM cutter material was performed to correlate temperature and holding time with the sample hardness profiles. Comparison of hardness measurements and tempering results indicate a surface temperature in excess of 620 C in three TBM cutters. This temperature is given a holding time of one hour. The temperature gradient was seen to correlate with depth of deformation in the material. A high deformation rate is believed to account for steep hardness gradients found. No estimate for surface temperature was found for the RIAT mini-cutters...|$|R
40|$|Rock {{drilling}} is {{the process}} employed to retrieve both the conventional and the unconventional resources, such as gas and oil buried deep under the ground. This study attempts to improve {{the understanding of the}} interaction between the drilling bit and rock by investigating the mechanics involved. In terms of achieving such a goal, a numerical modeling, if successful, can provide insights that are not possible through either field tests or laboratory experiments. When the cutting depth progresses from shallow to deep, there is a failure mode transition from ductile to brittle, and a critical depth that governs this transition. This study introduced Bažant’s simple size effect law into interpreting the transition process of rock cutting. By treating the cutting depth as a measure of size, the law was found applied well to rock cutting based upon the data available in the literature, and the Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling results. By introducing the concept of characteristic length, this study also reinterpreted the previous understanding of the critical depth in rock cutting, by introducing the concept of characteristic length, and obtained the influence of characteristic length on critical depth through numerical modeling. The Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) and the Rate of Penetration (ROP) are two key factors for evaluating the efficiency of a drilling process and together they form a good base for strategizing a desirable drilling operation. In the absence of cutter wear rate, a relationship between MSE and ROP for a rectangular cutter has previously been suggested. This study presented a simple model for a <b>circular</b> <b>cutter</b> that includes the wear progression, which could explain the laboratory result of cutting high strength rock under high pressure. The operation of a drilling bit in the field is mainly achieved through circular cutting action. This study extended the previous efforts and modeled first the circular cutting of a single disc cutter. This effort then formed the basis of a full drilling bit modeling presented at the end. ...|$|R
