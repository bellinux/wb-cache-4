5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low <b>savings</b> <b>rate.</b> From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E

40|$|The {{adjusted}} net <b>saving</b> <b>rate,</b> initially {{known as}} the genuine <b>saving</b> <b>rate,</b> was first published by the World Bank in the late 1990 s as a more comprehensive measure of national saving and one more indicative of sustainable development. The adjusted net <b>saving</b> <b>rate</b> incorporated not just physical capital depreciation, but natural capital depletion and environmental damage, as well as including some human capital formation. In this paper, using a cross‐section of developing economies for 2001 – 2006, determinants of the adjusted net <b>saving</b> <b>rate</b> are estimated. For comparison, the same determinants for the gross national <b>saving</b> <b>rate</b> are estimated. Also, a basic Solow growth model is extended to incorporate natural resources and to justify a more comprehensive measure of savings, such as the adjusted net <b>saving</b> <b>rate,</b> for modeling economic growth. The two measures of savings are then compared as determinants in estimations of economic growth. Understanding the determinants of the adjusted net <b>saving</b> <b>rate</b> is useful for policies to promote sustainable development. sustainable development, adjusted net <b>saving</b> <b>rate,</b> genuine <b>saving</b> <b>rate,</b> economic growth, Q 01, E 21, O 47, O 57,...|$|R

25|$|From 1950, India ran {{continued}} {{trade deficits}} that increased in magnitude in the 1960s. Furthermore, the Government of India had a budget deficit problem {{and could not}} borrow money from abroad or from the private corporate sector, due to that sector's negative <b>savings</b> <b>rate.</b> As a result, the government issued bonds to the RBI, which increased the money supply, leading to inflation. In 1966, foreign aid, which had hitherto been {{a key factor in}} preventing devaluation of the rupee, was finally cut off and India was told it had to liberalise its restrictions on trade before foreign aid would again materialise. The response was the politically unpopular step of devaluation accompanied by liberalisation. Furthermore, The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 led the US and other countries friendly towards Pakistan to withdraw foreign aid to India, which necessitated more devaluation. Defense spending in 1965/1966 was 24.06% of total expenditure, the highest {{it has been in the}} period from 1965 to 1989 (Foundations, pp 195).

500|$|Growth {{had been}} of {{interest}} to 18th-century classical economists like Adam Smith, but work tapered off during the 19th and early 20th century marginalist revolution when researchers focused on microeconomics. The study of growth revived when neo-Keynesians Roy Harrod and Evsey Domar independently developed the Harrod–Domar model, an extension of Keynes's theory to the long-run, an area Keynes had not looked at himself. Their models combined Keynes's multiplier with an accelerator model of investment, and produced the simple result that growth equaled the <b>savings</b> <b>rate</b> divided by the capital output ratio (the amount of capital divided {{by the amount of}} output). The Harrod–Domar model dominated growth theory until Robert Solow and Trevor Swan independently developed neoclassical growth models in 1956. Solow and Swan produced a more empirically appealing model with [...] "balanced growth" [...] based on the substitution of labor and capital in production. Solow and Swan suggested that increased savings could only temporarily increase growth, and only technological improvements could increase growth in the long-run.

2500|$|Another issue {{can arise}} {{in regard to}} the capital-labor ratio in the global population. Freeman (2010) holds that the new {{entrants}} to the global workforce since the 1980s brought little capital with them, either because they were poor or because the capital they had was of little economic value. He estimates that the entry of China, India and the Eastern Bloc into the global economy cut the global capital-labor ratio to around 55–60% of what it otherwise would have been. The capital-labor ratio, according to Freeman, is a critical determinant of the wages paid to workers and of the returns to capital. The more capital each worker has, the higher will be their productivity and pay. Even considering the high <b>savings</b> <b>rate</b> of new entrants—he cites World Bank estimates that China has a <b>savings</b> <b>rate</b> of 40% of GDP—he estimates it would take 30 or so years for the world to re-attain the capital-labor ratio among the countries that had previously made up the global economy.

Real GDP grew nearly 3% during President Bush's first term but only 0.5% during his second term. During the Clinton administration, GDP growth was close to 4%. A significant driver of economic growth during the Bush administration was home equity extraction, in essence borrowing against {{the value of the}} home to finance personal consumption. Free cash used by consumers from equity extraction doubled from $627 billion in 2001 to $1,428 billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built, a total of nearly $5 trillion dollars over the period.

[...] To increase public saving, the President’s Budget freezes discretionary spending for five years, freezes government salaries for two years, and brings the deficit to three percent of GDP by {{the second half of}} this decade – a path consistent with the Administration’s commitments to cut the deficit in half by 2013, and to stabilize or reduce the national debt as a share of the economy.
