5|$|A Maasai {{con artist}} with the mutant ability to {{manipulate}} the weather, who teaches calmly and caringly at Xavier's school but has become bitter with other people's hatred for mutants, sometimes making her hate humans in return <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> she is afraid of them.|$|E
5|$|An {{applicant}} has {{the burden}} of proving that a legislative restriction on {{the freedom of speech}} {{has nothing to do with}} public order, public health or morality. There must be some substance in the applicant's complaint – the Government does not have an immediate duty to justify making a decision that restricts the applicant's right to freedom of speech <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> the applicant complains of an alleged infringement of Article 15(1).|$|E
5|$|In {{chemical}} fields, such as crystallography, space {{groups and}} point groups describe molecular symmetries and crystal symmetries. These symmetries underlie {{the chemical and}} physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables simplification of quantum mechanical analysis of these properties. For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> of the symmetry of the states involved.|$|E

5|$|Interestingly, the funerary {{complex of}} the layer pyramid shows {{no trace of}} an {{enclosure}} wall, which is present in both earlier and later pyramid complexes. This could be because the stones constituting the wall were robbed over time, or <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> the wall was never started, being usually the last element of the pyramid complex to be built.|$|E
5|$|Several diseases, like Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), Sendai virus, and Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, Mycoplasma pulmonis), are {{prevalent}} <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> their highly contagious natures work {{in tandem}} with the way rats are kept in laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders. It should be noted, however, that MRM is far less likely to occur in laboratory rats than in those kept as pets.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of musical}} {{instruments}} in worship was a divisive topic within the Stone-Campbell Movement from its earliest years, when some adherents opposed the practice on scriptural grounds, while {{others may have}} relied on a cappella <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> they lacked access to musical instruments. Alexander Campbell opposed the use of instruments in worship. As early as 1855, some Restoration Movement churches were using organs or pianos, ultimately leading the Churches of Christ to separate from the groups that condoned instrumental music.|$|E

5|$|There {{are a few}} {{inconsistencies}} {{from the}} naturalist's view point. Foxes and badgers are not necessarily mutual enemies in nature. Badgers do not normally invade the homes of foxes, and are not typically dirty. Badgers do sometimes eat bunnies, not from a predilection for bunnies but <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> they are omnivorous. The inconsistencies are few and employed to create individual characters rather than evoke an archetypical fox and badger.|$|E
5|$|Though Kikai {{started to}} {{photograph}} in Asakusa <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> {{it was near}} where he then lived, he has continued {{because of the nature}} of the place and its visitors. Once a bustling and fashionable area, Asakusa long ago lost this status. If it were as popular and crowded as it was before the war, Kikai says, he would go somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|Varno said he {{received}} uncredited assistance from {{his friends and}} fellow screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith, the latter of whom won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Defiant Ones (1958). Varno ran lines and ideas by both men and sought advice. Smith in particular inspired lines for the speech made by the monster {{at the end of}} the film, in which the creature discusses how the human characters consider him the embodiment of evil <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> he is different from them. Varno said much of that dialogue from Smith, however, ended up getting cut from the final film. One of the primary themes of the film, as embodied in John Corcoran's attempts to defend the alien creature, was that <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> someone or something is ugly or different does not necessarily make it evil. However, the script also followed a common trait of most horror films of the 1950s that even somewhat understandable monsters are not entirely sympathetic, and the Blood Beast creature proves itself evil by impregnating Corcoran against his will and pursuing world domination.|$|E

5|$|According to Jainism, {{the purpose}} of nonviolence is {{not because it is}} a commandment of a God or any other supreme being. Its purpose is also not <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> its {{observance}} is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows this path.|$|E
5|$|Idiots and lunatics {{had their}} land looked after by a court-appointed administrator, and any profits {{went into a}} trust fund to support the insane person. Due to the vested {{interest}} of the King (who would hold the lands) the actual lunacy or idiocy was determined by a jury, not by an individual judge. Under the Lunacy Act 1845 the Lord Chancellor {{had a right to}} appoint a commission to investigate the insanity of an individual; as part of his role as Keeper of the King's conscience, however, he would only do this when it was beneficial to the lunatic, not <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> somebody had been found insane.|$|E
5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system {{would lead to the}} continuation of slavery, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine feeling, to Burke's false feeling.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a member}} of the Ohio Senate, Carran was {{regarded}} as of extremely sunny disposition and given the nickname [...] "Laughing Tom," [...] owing to the fact that, as one contemporary put it, [...] "he <b>simply</b> laughs <b>because</b> he can't help it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bonacci {{released}} this {{comment on the}} album title: [...] "The album {{was going to be}} called No Bollocks! But in the end we decided to call it <b>simply</b> Girlschool <b>because</b> we realized we'd never used the name of the band as a title before".|$|R
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E
5|$|Other {{noble gases}} would be equally {{suitable}} {{for most of}} these applications, but argon {{is by far the}} cheapest. Argon is inexpensive, since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of cryogenic air separation in the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen: the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> it is inert and relatively cheap.|$|E
5|$|Rights of {{the poor}} was another area that was {{expanded}} by the ACLU. In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals. The ACLU {{played a key role}} in the 1968 King v. Smith decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.|$|E
5000|$|... 1,4-Dioxane is a heterocyclic organic compound, {{classified}} as an ether. It is a colorless liquid {{with a faint}} sweet odor {{similar to that of}} diethyl ether. The compound is often called <b>simply</b> dioxane <b>because</b> the other dioxane isomers (1,2- and 1,3-) are rarely encountered.|$|R

50|$|Although Szervánszky never {{actively}} {{fought for}} the dissidents cause, he certainly supported them. Although the official reason for his dismissal from the College of Applied Arts in 1957 was for some staff “re-structuring”, he believed he was <b>simply</b> dismissed <b>because</b> of his political beliefs. He never worked for any institution again.|$|R
5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{executive}} order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.... There should be a level playing field, where no one has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> they know me or anyone else in government.... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn {{everything there is to}} know about a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official must be prepared to defend every contract on its merits.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{victories}} in the 1930s cemented the ACLUs campaign to promote free speech. In Stromberg v. California, decided in 1931, the Supreme Court sided with the ACLU and affirmed {{the right of a}} communist party member to salute a communist flag. The result {{was the first time the}} Supreme Court used the Due Process Clause of the 14th amendment to subject states to the requirements of the First Amendment. In Near v. Minnesota, also decided in 1931, the Supreme Court ruled that states may not exercise prior restraint and prevent a newspaper from publishing, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> the newspaper had a reputation for being scandalous.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the emperor Lebna Dengel and the Portuguese had {{established}} diplomatic {{contact with each other}} in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor Zara Yaqob attended the Council of Florence in 1441, they were confused when council prelates insisted on referring to their monarch as Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, their admonitions did little to stop Europeans from calling the King of Ethiopia Prester John. Some writers who used the title did understand it was not an indigenous honorific; for instance Jordanus seems to use it <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> his readers would have been familiar with it, not because he thought it authentic.|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert, in his Chicago Sun-Times review, calls The Negotiator [...] "a {{triumph of}} style over story, and of acting over characters...Much {{of the movie}} simply {{consists}} of closeups {{of the two of}} them talking, but it's not <b>simply</b> dialogue <b>because</b> the actors make it more--invest it with conviction and urgency..." ...|$|R
50|$|Abstention in {{compulsory}} voting systems {{tends to be}} somewhat ineffective, as the protest 'message' {{is likely to be}} confused with apathy. Voters who do not care who is elected, but are <b>simply</b> voting <b>because</b> they must, may choose to abstain, and the abstention protest votes will be confused with the apathetic abstention votes.|$|R
40|$|Warm plaster is {{a mixture}} based on cement mortar, as well as {{perlitic}} sand, expanded clay, powder from pumice, granules of expanded polystyrene. This material is heat–insulating. And for heat–insulating material, it has unique properties. In some types of finishing work, it is <b>simply</b> necessary <b>because</b> it significantly simplifies the production work...|$|R
