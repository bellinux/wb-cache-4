40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for safely monitoring the grasping {{as well as the}} transportation of objects by an industrial robot in human-robot cooperation scenarios. We argue that the proposed projection-based sensor system is well suited to generate and establish dynamically well-shaped <b>safety</b> <b>spaces</b> enclosing both the robot and the desired object simultaneously. Depending on the proximity of object and robot these <b>safety</b> <b>spaces</b> may be clearly separated or also fused to an overall comprising one, providing as most as possible of the workspace to the user at any time. In this contribution we describe the adaptation of our projection-based sensor system and explain in detail our method to deal with these so called distributed <b>safety</b> <b>spaces</b> that allow a multi-purpose safeguarding of robots, objects or any safety-related area...|$|R

40|$|International {{organisations such as}} the World Health Organisation {{highlight}} the road crash problem in less motorised (or developing, or low income) countries like those in Southeast Asia and recommend the adoption of Western road safety measures. However, there are many differences between highly motorised and less motorised countries which raise questions about how successfully Western road safety knowledge and expertise can be transferred. [...] - A review of the statistical information on road crashes shows {{a great deal of}} uncertainty about both the scale and likely trajectory of road fatalities globally, in less motorised countries and in Asia. It is generally agreed, however, that Asia accounts for around half of all road fatalities, and analysis of the limited available data shows both that Southeast Asia is not an atypical region of Asia in road safety terms, and that Thailand and Vietnam are not atypical of Southeast Asian countries. [...] - A literature review of recommended practice approaches to road safety transfer in Asia shows that there are many economic, institutional, social and cultural factors which potentially influence the success of transfer. The review also shows that there is no coherent, comprehensive approach which either conceptualises these factors and their relationship to transfer outcomes, or uses an analysis of these factors to plan or modify transfer. To address this gap, this thesis develops a 'road safety space' model as a tool for conceptualisation and analysis, based on a biological metaphor which views the transfer of road safety measures from one context to another as analogous to the transfer of a species into a new ecological space. The road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> model explicitly considers economic, institutional, social and cultural factors (from specific to broad) which influence the particular road safety issue which a particular road safety transfer effort seeks to address. A central contention of this thesis is that the road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> model is both a feasible and useful tool to improve the process of road safety transfer to less motorised countries. Road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> analysis is seen to have a role in a broader process of selection of road safety measures for transfer, along with knowledge of how the measures are considered to operate. [...] - The research reported in this thesis is comprised of three studies. Study 1 reviewed evaluations of road safety transfer to Thailand and Vietnam. Studies 2 and 3 were case studies of road safety transfer to Thailand and Vietnam respectively. [...] - Study 1 was an analysis of existing evaluations of road safety transfer to Thailand and Vietnam. The aims were to analyse the evaluations for their consideration of contextual factors, as described in the road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> model, and to discuss whether the road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> model assisted in understanding the reasons for success or failure of transfer. However, very few such evaluations exist, and those that were found generally lacked information on whether contextual factors were considered. This indicated the need for a more detailed, in-depth qualitative investigation of particular cases of road safety transfer, in order to investigate the feasibility and utility of the road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> model. [...] - Two case studies (Study 2 and Study 3) were conducted to test whether the road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> approach was both feasible and useful as a means of improving road safety transfer efforts. Study 2 was a case study of the development and implementation in Thailand of a road safety education program for school children, which involved the transfer of Western research and techniques. The transfer agents (i. e. those who effected the road safety transfer) were Australian consultants working for the Australian Road Research Board (ARRB). The transfer was funded by the World Bank and managed by the Thai Ministry of Education (MOE). Study 3 was a case study of {{the development and implementation of}} a motorcycle helmet wearing program in Vietnam, which involved the transfer of Western knowledge, techniques and technology. The transfer agents were staff of Asia Injury (AI), a non-government organisation (NGO), and the program was funded initially by a charitable fund, with the intention of becoming self-funding through operation of a helmet factory. [...] - The case studies employed background research into existing information on economic, institutional, social and cultural factors relevant to the road safety issues (road use behaviour of school children in Thailand and motorcycle helmet purchase and wearing in Vietnam), and collected data through interviews with key informants, analysis of secondary sources and observations. This information was used to derive the road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> for each road safety issue, to identify the road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> recognised and addressed by the transfer agents (ARRB and AI), and to determine which factors they missed, or were aware of but took no action on. The focus of this analysis was on the processes used in transfer, not on the road safety outcomes of transfer, although these provided information on the processes as well. Available evaluation information was used to draw links between the omissions and the success of the transfer processes. It was noted that information on how the transferred measures operate should come from a road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> analysis in the originating country, although this raised questions about selection of country and time (when the measure was first introduced, or in its maturity). [...] - The feasibility and utility of the road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> model were discussed. It was clear that the model provided information on the cases which was missed by the transfer agents. The questions examined next were whether this information could have been obtained from an exercise conducted before the transfer had commenced, whether the required effort and cost justified the potential benefits, and whether the information on the road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> could have been useful for the transfer agents. Comparisons between the road safety spaces for the two cases showed some areas of commonality, e. g. perceptions of police corruption, but also many differences. It was considered likely that some broad factors could be generic, and the possibility was mooted that less motorised countries share issues with police enforcement. This requires further research, however, and at this stage it is better to treat each road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> as a unique combination of contextual factors influencing the road safety issue of interest. [...] - It is concluded that the road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> model is feasible if used in such a way as to minimise the research involved, and useful, although the degree of utility needs to be further explored in a prospective study. The limitation introduced by restricting informants to those who could speak English are discussed. An approach using road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> analysis is recommended, emphasising analysis of the country to which the road safety measure is being transferred, supplemented by analysis of the originating country road <b>safety</b> <b>space.</b> Gaps in knowledge are identified for further research and development, in particular the theoretical and practical understanding of road use behaviours and their modification in less motorised countries in Southeast Asia. Elaboration of the model is also recommended, to take into account the influence of the type of measure transferred, the role of the transfer agent, the area of road safety (education, engineering or enforcement), and the time dimension (the time which might be needed for a transfer to show its effects). [...] - The findings of this research are likely to be applicable to road safety transfer in other less motorised regions of the world, however prospective testing is needed. They may also be relevant to issues of transfer for areas other than road safety, in particular public health and traffic engineering, where similar economic, institutional, social and cultural issues come together...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The old-age home {{industry}} is mostly unregulated {{and there is}} a need for putting in place certain minimum standards. Many times poor and destitute persons who may need institution-based care cannot afford them. Long-term care has a price, {{and there is a}}lso a need for debate on its policy and best practice. Objective:The objectives were to study the quality of life of elderly people, to assess the facilities available and the factors associated with elderly people for availing the residential services of old age homes. Methodology: It was a descriptive cross-sectional study. Study population was elderly (age ? 60 years) enrolled in public and private old age homes (OAHs) of Lucknow city. All the elderly living in OAHs for ? 6 months and had given the consent for interview were included in the study. Results:The most important reason for elderly people living in public OAHs was no care taking person at home (77. 1 %) and private OAHs it was (36. 4 %). Services like medical services, recreational facilities, <b>safety,</b> <b>space</b> availability and staff availability were significantly better (p < 0. 05) in private type of OAHs. In public type OAHs 85. 7 percent inmates had quality of life below average whereas in paid OAHs 63. 6 percent inmates had average or above average quality of life. Conclusions:No care taking person at home was the important reasons in OAHs. With the exception of food all the variables like Medical service, Recreational facilities, <b>Safety,</b> <b>Space</b> availability, Staff availability were significantly better in private OAHs. Quality of life in private OAHs was significantly better than public OAHs...|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} to P/T PN, TPN yield the time behaviour of marking (stepped functions), expressing the escape {{of people from}} the rooms and corridors to the <b>safety</b> <b>spaces.</b> FOHPN offer similar information but in the form of piecewise-linear real functions–flows. The FOHPN continuous part corresponds directly to the EA structure (the places model the rooms and the transitions model the gate-ways), while their discrete part makes possible to affect the throughput of the gate-ways. Instead of the supervisor(s), the P/T PN or TPN modules are used to influence the continuous transitions, and consequently, also the escape. First of all TPN and FOHPN will be concisely introduced. Then, the relation between the TPN model and P/T PN one [4] will be explained. The supervisors used in the P/T PN model will be utilized in TPN too. Time specifications will be assigned to the TPN model. Next, the FOHPN model will be presented and described. Finally, simulation results obtained by means of the handy simulation tool HYPENS for Matlab [19, 20] will be displayed for both kinds of models. They will show emptying the rooms and corridor and filling the <b>safety</b> <b>spaces</b> at different kind of timing the discrete transitions.|$|R

Notice, that the courses of the escape at the deterministic timing (i.e. at time delays) of the TPN transitions and those at the non-deterministic timing (namely at the exponential probability distribution) are indeed different but comparable as to shapes of the curves.|$|R

40|$|High-power {{converters}} {{based on}} elementary switching cells {{are more and}} more used in the industry of power electronics owing to various advantages such as lower voltage stress and reduced power loss. However, the complexity of controlling such converters is a major challenge that the power manufacturing industry has to face with.

The state of the system is not guaranteed to stay within the limits that are admissible for its correct electrical behavior. We show here how to apply a formal method in order to synthesise a correct-by-design control that guarantees that the power converter will always stay within a predefined safe zone of variations for its input parameters. Our method finds local invariants by decomposing the <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> into smaller zones. The method is applied in order to synthesize correct-by-design controls for a 5 -level and 7 -level power converters. We check the validity of our approach by numerical simulations and physical experimentations done with a prototype built by SATIE laboratory...|$|E

40|$|AbstractQuality {{assessment}} of a construction project schedule can be a challenging task for project stakeholders. A little research work has addressed quality of schedules though a good project schedule {{can be considered as}} of the key factors of project success. The development of a reliable and easy to perform construction schedule quality assessment procedure seems to be a challenging task. Since Schedule Health Assessment of a construction project has to be strictly related to process requirements, it is used the 3 “S” rule as a starting point and framework for obtaining improved understanding of quality of construction schedules. The 3 “S” are <b>Safety,</b> <b>Space</b> and Structure, meaning that the planned process should provide a safe working environment to construction workers, sufficient space to perform construction activities and the required sequence of construction operations and project phases. The aim of the study is to implement a schedule quality assessment method that takes into account the 3 “S” rule of construction process. The 3 “S” requirements can be successfully integrated in a Schedule Health Assessment method, but to facilitate their implementation and control a flow-line chart is needed,thus the schedule tool becomes a new requirement for construction schedule quality control...|$|E
40|$|The global {{road toll}} is {{estimated}} to be about 1 million fatalities each year, with the majority occurring in less motorised countries. As these countries motorise, sometimes quite rapidly, this figure is expected to rise. The transfer of road safety knowledge and expertise from highly motorised countries to less motorised countries is advocated by international agencies such as the World Health Organisation; however, the mixed successes of road safety transfer efforts are also acknowledged. This paper presents a ‘road <b>safety</b> <b>space</b> ’ model and method for improving road safety transfer, based on research conducted in two Southeast Asian countries. The model recognises that road safety problems and countermeasures are influenced by factors which lie outside the immediate context, both in the recipient country and in the country in which a particular countermeasure has proven to be effective. A method is outlined for the documentation and analysis of these factors, to enable a more considered approach to road safety transfer and a greater likelihood of success. The results of case studies of the approach are presented {{as an example of the}} method in action, and ways of improving the method further are discussed. ...|$|E

Design Qualitative focus group study. Setting A deprived neighbourhood. Sample Four focus groups were conducted with 10 residents from the neighbourhood undergoing change, nine pupils from a local primary school, 10 students and tutors from a local further education college and three local authority planners overseeing the developments. Results We identified four main themes relating to the impact of environmental change. These were <b>safety,</b> <b>space,</b> antisocial behaviour and physical activity and health, the latter being the least important to all groups. A mismatch regarding environmental change emerged in perspectives between different stakeholders. The residents were most concerned about home and car (parking) safety and in particular felt that the new cycle/walk way would reduce their safety, whereas the planners felt that the environmental change would provide a safer and healthier environment for the residents.
