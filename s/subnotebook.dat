25|$|Intel {{developed}} {{a set of}} specifications for the Ultrabook, a higher-end type of <b>subnotebook</b> produced by various PC manufacturers and usually running Windows. Competing directly with the Air, the Ultrabook is intended to reduce size and weight, and extend battery life without compromising performance.|$|E
25|$|The MacBook Air {{is a line}} of Macintosh <b>subnotebook</b> {{computers}} {{developed and}} manufactured by Apple Inc. It consists of a full-size keyboard, a machined aluminum case, and a thin light structure. The Air is available with a screen size of (measured diagonally) 13.3in (33.782cm), with different specifications produced by Apple. As of 2011, all MacBook Air models use solid-state drive storage and Intel Core i5 or i7 CPUs. A MacBook Air with an 11.6in (29.46cm) screen was made available in 2010 and was discontinued end of 2016.|$|E
500|$|The PowerBook100 is a {{portable}} <b>subnotebook</b> personal computer that was [...] designed and manufactured by Sony for Apple Computer and introduced on October 21, 1991, at the COMDEX computer expo in Las Vegas, Nevada. Priced at US$2,300, the PowerBook100 was the low-end {{model of the}} first three simultaneously released PowerBooks. Its CPU and overall speed closely resembled those of its predecessor, the Macintosh Portable. It had a Motorola 68000 16-megahertz (MHz) processor, 2-8megabytes (MB) of memory, a [...] monochrome backlit liquid crystal display (LCD) with 640400pixel resolution, and the System 7.0.1 operating system. It did not have a built-in floppy disk drive and was noted for its unique compact design that placed a trackball pointing device in front of the keyboard for ease of use.|$|E
50|$|These {{computers}} are sometimes {{confused with the}} ultra-mobile PC category, which {{is the name of}} a platform of small form-factor tablet PCs. UMPCs are smaller than <b>subnotebooks,</b> however both generally run full desktop operating systems such as Windows or Linux, rather than specialized software such as Windows CE, Palm OS, or Internet Tablet OS. <b>Subnotebooks</b> are also sometimes confused with netbooks which are a different category of devices that branched off from mini notebooks in general. Netbooks are most often much less expensive than <b>subnotebooks,</b> as they are optimized for use as portable Internet capable devices and generally lack the processing power of a workstation. Netbooks typically have 9W TDP CPUs, sacrificing performance for power efficiency, whereas <b>subnotebooks</b> often use 18W TDP processors.|$|R
50|$|Sony also {{launched}} the C1 range of <b>subnotebooks,</b> starting in Japan in January 2000.|$|R
40|$|<b>Subnotebooks,</b> or ‘netbooks, are a {{relatively}} new consumer market but one that continues to grow significantly worldwide.

50|$|A <b>subnotebook</b> or an ultraportable, is {{a laptop}} {{designed}} and marketed {{with an emphasis}} on portability (small size, low weight, and often longer battery life). Subnotebooks are usually smaller and lighter than standard laptops, weighing between 0.8 and 2 kg (2-5 lb), with a battery life exceeding 10 hours. Since the introduction of netbooks and ultrabooks, the line between subnotebooks and either category has blurred. Netbooks are a more basic and cheap type of <b>subnotebook,</b> and while some ultrabooks have a screen size too large to qualify as subnotebooks, certain ultrabooks fit in the <b>subnotebook</b> category. One notable example of a <b>subnotebook</b> is the Apple MacBook Air.|$|E

50|$|An ultra-mobile PC (ultra-mobile {{personal}} computer or UMPC) was a miniature {{version of a}} pen computer, a class of laptop whose specifications were launched by Microsoft and Intel in spring 2006. Sony had already made a first attempt in this direction in 2004 with its Vaio U series, which was however only sold in Asia. UMPCs are generally smaller than <b>subnotebooks,</b> have a TFT display measuring (diagonally) about 12.7 to 17.8 cm (5 to 7 inch screen), are operated like tablet PCs using a touchscreen or a stylus, and can also have a physical keyboard. There is no clear boundary between <b>subnotebooks</b> and ultra-mobile PCs.|$|R
