40|$|Young {{children}} {{sometimes make}} serious attempts to perform impossible actions on miniature objects {{as if they}} were full-size objects. The existing explanations of these curious action errors assume (but never explicitly tested) children’s decreased attention to object size information. This study investigated the attention to object size information in <b>scale</b> <b>errors</b> performers. Two groups of children aged 18 - 25 months (N = 52) and 48 - 60 months (N = 23) were tested in two consecutive tasks: an action task that replicated the original <b>scale</b> <b>errors</b> elicitation situation, and a looking task that involved watching on a computer screen actions performed with adequate to inadequate size object. Our key finding - that children performing <b>scale</b> <b>errors</b> in the action task subsequently pay less attention to size changes than non-scale errors performers in the looking task - suggests that the origins of <b>scale</b> <b>errors</b> in childhood operate already at the perceptual level, and not at the action level...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{manufacturers}} {{use only}} a single gauge. In these instruments, the orifice inlet pressure is maintained automatically by the pressure regulator. A single gauge works well as long as leakage flow is much less than regulator flow. Any error in the input pressure will produce a corresponding error in the reading. As a single gauge instrument approaches 100% leakage, the leakage <b>scale</b> <b>error</b> reaches maximum. This {{may or may not}} induce significant error, depending on regulator flow and orifice flow. At low and modest leakage percentages, {{there is little or no}} difference between single and dual gauges.|$|E

This system used precision electrical contacts to actuate the torque motor and achieved an accuracy of 1 part in 1000 to 1 part per 10000 known in technical parlance as a <b>scale</b> <b>error</b> of 1000 to 100. This was equivalent to about 600m of accuracy over the V2 1500m/s speed and 320km flight. Since the number of shaft rotations represented speed, a cam switch was used to initiate missile control sequences such as engine throttle-down and shut-off.|$|E
40|$|X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) {{has become}} an {{important}} technology for quality control of industrial components. As with other technologies, e. g., tactile coordinate measurements or optical measurements, CT is influenced by numerous quantities which may have {{negative impact on the}} accuracy and repeatability of dimensional and geometrical measurements. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss different methods for the correction of <b>scaling</b> <b>errors</b> and to quantify their influence on dimensional measurements. <b>Scaling</b> <b>errors</b> occur first and foremost in CT systems with no built-in compensation of positioning errors of the manipulator system (magnification axis). This article also introduces a new compensation method for <b>scaling</b> <b>errors</b> using a database of reference scaling factors and discusses its advantages and disadvantages. In total, three methods for the correction of <b>scaling</b> <b>errors</b> - using the CT ball plate, using calibrated features measured by CMM and using a database of reference values - are presented and applied within a case study. The investigation was performed on a dose engine component of an insulin pen, for which several dimensional measurands were defined. The component has a complex geometry and is made of brass, which makes its measurements with CT challenging. It is shown that each <b>scaling</b> <b>error</b> correction method results in different deviations between CT measurements and reference measurements from a CMM. Measurement uncertainties were estimated for each method, taking into consideration the contributions related to the applied correction method. The newly suggested approach using the database appeared to work well, indicating, that if the properties of a CT system under investigation are monitored using a reference object (ball bar in our case), a correction factor based on individual selected magnification factors can be applied for <b>scaling</b> <b>error</b> correction of any object, and thus no additional scanning of a reference object is needed...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a polarization modulation unit (PMU) to rotate a waveplate continuously {{in order to}} observe solar magnetic fields by spectropolarimetry. The non-uniformity of the PMU rotation may cause errors in the measurement {{of the degree of}} linear polarization (<b>scale</b> <b>error)</b> and its angle (crosstalk between Stokes-Q and -U), although it does not cause an artificial linear polarization signal (spurious polarization). We rotated a waveplate with the PMU to obtain a polarization modulation curve and estimated the <b>scale</b> <b>error</b> and crosstalk caused by the rotation non-uniformity.

Thus, we write a new anisotropic local error indicator and we test it for mesh adaptation on convection-dominated benchmarks in 2 D and 3 D.

40|$|In dynamic {{linear models}} (DLMs) with unknown fixed parameters, a {{standard}} Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling {{strategy is to}} alternate sampling of latent states conditional on fixed parameters and sampling of fixed parameters conditional on latent states. In some regions of the parameter space, this standard data augmentation (DA) algorithm can be inefficient. To improve efficiency, we apply the interweaving strategies of Yu and Meng to DLMs. For this, we introduce three novel alternative DAs for DLMs: the <b>scaled</b> <b>errors,</b> wrongly <b>scaled</b> <b>errors,</b> and wrongly <b>scaled</b> disturbances. With the latent states and the less well known scaled disturbances, this yields five unique DAs to employ in MCMC algorithms. Each DA implies a unique MCMC sampling strategy {{and they can be}} combined into interweaving and alternating strategies that improve MCMC efficiency. We assess these strategies using the local level model and demonstrate that several strategies improve efficiency relative to the standard approach and the most efficient strategy interweaves the <b>scaled</b> <b>errors</b> and <b>scaled</b> disturbances.
