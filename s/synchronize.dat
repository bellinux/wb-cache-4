40|$|We {{present a}} {{distributed}} execution model for asynchronous systems with crash failures {{that we call}} <b>Synchronized</b> Phase System.

More precisely, a <b>Synchronized</b> Phase System is a sequence of phases, and each phase is a sequence of <b>synchronized</b> rounds. The number of successive <b>synchronized</b> rounds characterizes the liveness properties of <b>Synchronized</b> Phase Systems. A <b>Synchronized</b> Phase System is a good paradigm to design fault tolerant algorithms and we show how to use it to implement efficiently Consensus and Atomic Broadcast. <b>Synchronized</b> Phase Systems can be implemented in asynchronous systems, but the liveness properties depend on the knowledge of processes concerning the failure of other processes. <b>Synchronized</b> Phase Systems are also a good abstraction for "real world" distributed systems like synchronous systems containing some sorts of timing and crash [...] ...|$|R

5|$|P.exclamans {{tend to have}} smaller nests {{than other}} wasps, with {{typically}} fewer than one hundred individuals in a given nest. Because {{of the size of}} the nest, the queen tends to be the most active individual in the nest. This is because the queen has to monitor and directly control the activities of the nest. In addition to her reproductive role, the queen must also act as the pacemaker of the nest and <b>synchronize</b> the worker activity. These last two points have recently been disputed and the workers may be self organized. It has also been observed that the queen will act aggressively towards individuals that are the least active.|$|E

5|$|USB is {{a serial}} bus, using four {{shielded}} wires for the USB2.0 variant: two for power (VBUS and GND), and two for differential data signals (labelled as D+ and D− in pinouts).

D+ and D− signals are transmitted on a differential pair, providing half-duplex data transfers for USB2.0. Mini and micro connectors have their GND connections moved from pin #4 to pin #5, while their pin #4 serves as an ID pin for the On-The-Go host/client identification.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not only}} {{receptive}} fields that define the microzone structure: The climbing fiber input from the inferior olivary nucleus is equally important. The branches of a climbing fiber (usually numbering about 10) usually activate Purkinje cells belonging to the same microzone. Moreover, olivary neurons that send climbing fibers to the same microzone tend to be coupled by gap junctions, which <b>synchronize</b> their activity, causing Purkinje cells within a microzone to show correlated complex spike activity on a millisecond time scale. Also, the Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone all send their axons to the same small cluster of output cells within the deep cerebellar nuclei. Finally, the axons of basket cells are much longer in the longitudinal direction than in the mediolateral direction, causing them to be confined largely to a single microzone. The consequence of all this structure is that cellular interactions within a microzone are much stronger than interactions between different microzones.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in HD {{is generally}} around 20years following {{the onset of}} visible symptoms. Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to <b>synchronize</b> movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and {{an increased risk of}} aspirating food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second greatest risk is heart disease, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD. Suicide is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' desires to avoid the later stages of the disease. Other associated risks include choking, physical injury from falls, and malnutrition.|$|E

5|$|On 8 April 1940 eight {{aircraft}} of 1./ZG76, {{under the}} command of Staffelkapitän Werner Hansen, deployed northward from Jever to Westerland on Sylt in preparation for operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway. The German plan for the attack called for an amphibious assault on the Norwegian capital, Oslo, and six major ports from Kristiansand in the south to Narvik in the north. Simultaneously, Junkers 52 (Ju52) transport aircraft would drop parachute troops to secure Oslo's Fornebu airport. Additional Ju52s were scheduled to arrive at Fornebu twenty minutes after the parachute drop, by which time the airfield had to be in German hands. 1./ZG76 was to provide air cover and ground-attack support for both waves. Eight Bf110 Zerstörer of 1./ZG76 took off at 7:00 in the morning, planning to <b>synchronize</b> their arrival at Fornebu with the parachute drop at 8:45. The distance from Westerland to Fornebu meant that this was a one-way operation; the Bf110s could not hold enough fuel for the return trip. Their fuel was calculated to provide them 20 minutes flying time over Fornebu, and the pilots would have to land at Fornebu once the airfield had been seized.|$|E
5|$|Composer Yoshihiro Ike infused {{the music}} with the sorrow {{borne by the}} karas, and the {{atmosphere}} conveyed by the background. Ike obliged the team's request for Japanese flavored music, and studied kabuki tunes accompanying actors as they strike their , a picturesque pose to establish their character. He planned to use taikos (Japanese drums) to further enhance the music, but felt the show had taken on an international outlook and discarded the notion. He wanted his music to match {{the quality of the}} show, and refrained from composing them until he had watched the pre-dubbed version of the first episode. He composed most of his music as he watched the pre-dubbed episodes to <b>synchronize</b> their tempo and dynamics with the action in the show. He chose Prague Symphony Orchestra to perform the main theme because he felt the background of their city and its people suited the character of Karas. Other departments also took extraordinary measures in producing the show. The sound crew procured a Nissan Skyline GT-R and recorded its engine noise for several runs. These were used for the tunnel chase scenes which involved a hand-drawn 1972–77 Skyline. The editing team took the additional step of editing cels post-voice recording to ensure lip movements were in synch with the voices. These extra work and the hybrid 2D-3D approach inflated the budget of the production to three times the usual amount spent on an original video animation.|$|E
5|$|Milius {{recruited}} his friend, Basil Poledouris, {{to produce}} the score for Conan; they had had a successful collaboration on Big Wednesday. The film industry's usual practice was to contract a composer to start work after the main scenes had been filmed, but Milius hired Poledouris before principal photography had started. The composer was {{given the opportunity to}} compose the film's music based on the initial storyboards and to modify it throughout filming before recording the score near the end of production. Poledouris made extensive use of Musync, a music and tempo editing hardware and software system invented by Robert Randles (subsequently nominated for an Oscar for Scientific Achievement), to modify the tempo of his compositions and <b>synchronize</b> them with the action in the film. The system helped make his job easier and faster; it could automatically adjust tempos when the user changed the positioning of beats. In the montage where Conan grows up, for example, Poledouris had Randles prepare, over the phone, a long accelerando that landed on precise moments in the picture along the way. Poledouris would otherwise have had to conduct the orchestra and adjust his compositions on the fly. Conan is the first film to list Musync in its credits.|$|E

5|$|Thus, on {{the morning}} of 13 September, the tenth day of the march from Caputvada, the Roman army {{approached}} Ad Decimum. There Gelimer planned to ambush and encircle them, using a force under his brother Ammatas to block their advance and engage them, while 2,000 men under his nephew Gibamund would attack their left flank, and Gelimer himself with the main army would attack from the rear and completely annihilate the Roman army. In the event, the three forces failed to <b>synchronize</b> exactly: Ammatas arrived early and was killed as he attempted a reconnaissance with a small force by the Roman vanguard, while Gibamund's force was intercepted by the Hunnic flank guard and was utterly destroyed. Unaware of all this, Gelimer marched up with the main army and scattered the Roman advance forces present at Ad Decimum. Victory might have been his, but he then came upon his dead brother's body, and apparently forgot all about the battle. This gave Belisarius the time to rally his troops, come up with his main cavalry force and defeat the disorganized Vandals. Gelimer with the remainder of his forces fled westwards to Numidia. The Battle of Ad Decimum ended in a crushing Roman victory, and Carthage lay open and undefended before Belisarius.|$|E
