They have short side tanks, a rear coal bunker, and a unified, oval dome containing the steam dome inside a larger <b>sand</b> <b>dome.</b> This arrangement, popular worldwide in nations that favored the <b>sand</b> <b>dome,</b> helped both to insulate the steam dome {{and to keep the}} sand dry with the warmth. Large, prominent builder's plates adorn the domes. They utilise Walschaerts valve gear with piston valves and superheating, and are painted in the traditional European style of red below the running board, including frames and wheels, and black above, including boiler, cab, tanks etc. The purpose of the red paint is to make cracks and breakages in the locomotive's important running gear more obvious.|$|E

50|$|Like many {{classes of}} {{specialised}} freight engines on NZR, {{eight of the}} ten BA locomotives were modified to perform shunting duties. This included an all-weather cab fixture on the tender to provide shelter for crews, and second <b>sand</b> <b>domes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{locomotives}} had 13 ft coupled wheelbase, which {{combined with}} a stiff frame caused track damage. The frames flexibility was improved by removing the continuous running plates and replacing them with boiler mounted boards. These were unsuited to the standard NZR sandbox {{of the time and}} so the engines were given <b>sand</b> <b>domes.</b> The last three had a 12 ft wheelbase.|$|R

50|$|Superheating {{was applied}} in the 1920s, {{followed}} by piston valves shortly afterwards. Between 1935 and 1940 the class received Waikato spark arrestors and tender cabs. Second <b>sand</b> <b>domes</b> and standard funnels were added around this time. By now the class were all stationed in Southland and performed branchline work in and around Invercargill, and were well regarded in these duties.|$|R
25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} {{are nearly}} always fitted with sandboxes from which sand {{can be delivered}} to the rails to improve traction and braking in wet or icy weather. On American locomotives the sandboxes, or <b>sand</b> <b>domes,</b> are usually mounted {{on top of the}} boiler. In Britain, the limited loading gauge precludes this, so the sandboxes are mounted just above, or just below, the running plate.|$|R

50|$|Modifications {{included}} lengthening the smokebox, {{a common}} procedure on many early NZR types, and <b>sand</b> <b>domes</b> were provided, while the running boards were raised. In the 1920s either {{two or three}} (sources vary) received superheated boilers of 200 lb sq in working pressure. However, the class was gone {{before the end of}} the 1930s, the superheated boilers going to members of the UC class of the same maker. One was reportedly dumped on the Oamaru foreshore.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the opening}} of the Otira Tunnel in 1923 all ten were {{gradually}} transferred to the West Coast of the South Island. Due to weight restrictions they were the most powerful mainline locomotives on the West Coast until the 1940s. In the late 1920s and 1930s seven locomotives were fitted with narrow firebox superheated boilers [...] and lever type reverse controls in place of the original wheel and screw type. Other alterations included fitting <b>sand</b> <b>domes</b> and a new type of funnel. The remaining three locomotives were withdrawn by 1937.|$|R

50|$|About {{the same}} time these {{modifications}} were being carried out, NZR began extending the lives of specialised goods locomotives by adapting them for heavy shunting work. This included the provision of a second <b>sand</b> <b>dome</b> and a tender cab. Some tenders were cut down to improve rearward visibility. The resulting mix of boiler and tender combinations meant the class had a far from standard appearance in later years.|$|E
50|$|In {{most of the}} {{affected}} areas, run-up heights were {{in the range of}} 4 - 6 m.At Iruma, run-up heights of 13.2 and 16.5 m have been measured, much higher than most of the surrounding area. This and the deposition of the unusual <b>sand</b> <b>dome,</b> with an estimated volume of 700,000 m3, is interpreted to have been caused by the effects of resonance in the V-shaped Iruma bay.|$|E
50|$|Various {{forms of}} dunes are {{found within the}} limits of White <b>Sands.</b> <b>Dome</b> dunes are found along the {{southwest}} margins of the field, transverse and barchan in the core of the field, and parabolic dunes occur in high numbers along the northern, southern, and northeastern margins.From the visitor center at the entrance of the park, the Dunes Drive leads 8 mi into the dunes. Four marked trails allow one to explore the dunes by foot. During the summer, there are also Ranger-guided orientation and nature walks.

5000|$|UP 737 {{began its}} career {{as part of}} one of the largest {{locomotive}} orders on record up to that date, for use on Union Pacific passenger and freight trains. As delivered, the locomotive had a long, pointed, vertical bar wooden pilot, an oil [...] "box" [...] headlight, a [...] "diamond" [...] stack of the shallow diamond style peculiar to the Union Pacific at that period. It had steam and <b>sand</b> <b>domes</b> that appeared comparatively square in profile and lacked the common, ornate, cast-iron dome [...] "rings," [...] a decorative molding that dressed up the appearance of such domes and that many 19th century locomotives sported. Upon entering service, the locomotive reportedly had the initials [...] "O.& R.V." [...] painted on the small panel below the windows {{on each side of the}} cab, standing for the name of a Union Pacific subsidiary in Nebraska, the Omaha and Republican Valley Railroad. Later the locomotive had [...] "Union Pacific" [...] spelled out in small letters on each side of the cab, probably in white, and a large white [...] "737" [...] on each side of its black tender.|$|R

50|$|One of the {{locomotive}}s, no. 505, {{was sold}} to the East Rand Proprietary Mines on the Witwatersrand. The sale must have taken place between 1894, when the mine was registered, and 1905, since the locomotive {{does not appear in}} the NGR's 1904 year-end report. Photographic evidence also shows that it had not been modified in respect of the extended smokebox and <b>sand</b> <b>dome.</b> By the time this locomotive was involved in a bad accident which resulted in it having to be scrapped c. 1970, it had been in service for more than ninety years.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had a {{box frame}} with a water tank. The short boiler barrel comprised two boiler rings. On {{top of the}} boiler were the steam dome, two spring-balance, safety valves and a <b>sand</b> <b>dome.</b> The flat valves were operated by an Allan valve gear, the connecting rod worked the third axle. On the first locomotives the driving gear was also covered, but these were removed around 1908. The coal bunkers were located {{in front of the}} driver's cab. The engines carried up to 1.77 m3 of water and 0.65 tonnes of coal.|$|E
50|$|In temples, people erect a sand hillock on temple grounds. They mound {{up a big}} pointed hill of <b>sand</b> or <b>dome</b> in {{the center}} which {{represents}} Valuka Chaitya, the stupa at Tavatimsa where the Buddha's hair and diadem are buried. The big stupa is surrounded by four small ones, which represent the stupas of the Buddha's favorite disciples: Sariputta, Moggallana, Ananda, and Maha Kassapa. There is another tradition called Sraung Preah (ស្រង់ព្រះ) : pouring water or liquid plaster (a mixture of water with some chalk powder) on elder relative, or people (mostly the younger generation is responsible for pouring the water).|$|R

5000|$|... 1880s - 1900s, Steam {{locomotive}} livery was simplified {{after the}} Jay Gould {{gained control of}} the railroad. Gould instructed shop personnel to paint all engines black and place the railroad initials M. K. & T. in about 12 inch letters {{on the side of}} the tender tank bordered by half inch striping. The engine number was placed on side of the crew cab, side of the <b>sand</b> <b>dome,</b> coping of the tender and back of tender. Rolling stock used colors common in those days, i.e. boxcar brown, caboose red, etc.|$|E
5000|$|... 1900s - 1923, Steam {{locomotive}} livery was simplified {{to overall}} shiny black, dark graphite smokebox, smokebox door and stack. The color of all lettering and numbers {{was changed to}} white. The road name, M. K. &. T. {{was moved to the}} side of the crew cab, along with the engine number. The engine number was painted on the side of the tenders in large numerals and on the rear in smaller numerals; the number remained on the <b>sand</b> <b>dome.</b> Rolling stock used colors common in those days, i.e. boxcar brown, caboose red, etc.|$|E
50|$|The sand may be {{delivered}} by gravity, by a steam-blast (steam locomotives) or by compressed air. Gravity sanding {{requires that the}} sand be dry so that it runs freely. Locomotives used multiple sandboxes, so that their delivery pipes could be short and near-vertical. Engine sheds in the UK were equipped with sand drying stoves, so that sandboxes could be refilled each morning with dry sand. Steam locomotives in the USA had a single sandbox, called a <b>sand</b> <b>dome</b> {{on top of the}} boiler where the rising heat helped to dry the sand. Even with this arrangement, sand pipes tended to clog, and by the 1880s, pneumatic sanding systems were being proposed.|$|E

50|$|For {{the first}} series, {{the show was}} filmed at Shepperton Studios, within a stage set {{measuring}} 30000 sq ft and containing a water tank on-site. After the first series, the production team decided to expand the maze, relocating the set to an adapted aircraft hangar, Hangar 6, operated by Aces High Studios at North Weald Airfield in Essex. After the show ended in 1995, when Channel 4's contract with producers Chatsworth TV expired, the set was eventually dismantled. When the broadcaster {{decided to make a}} one-off edition of the show for Stand Up for Cancer in 2016, the episode was filmed at The Crystal Maze live immersive experience in London, as it was no longer possible to use the original set. When Channel 4 made the decision to revive the show for a full series in November 2016, James Dillon was asked to design a new set at a 30000 sq ft warehouse at The Bottle Yard Studios in Bristol. Dillon went back to his original plans and sketches but took the opportunity to build and expand on several of his original ideas and concepts. The most drastic being that the Crystal Dome is actually located in a septate part of the studio, originally it's proximity to the Aztec zone caused a problem with <b>sand</b> contaminating the <b>Dome</b> area.|$|R
