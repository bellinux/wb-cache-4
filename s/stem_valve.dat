40|$|AbstractIn this paperwe {{investigated}} the protective valve designed for automatic protection {{of equipment and}} pipelines from inadmissible or in-process changes in the parameters or direction of the fluid flow and to shut off the flow without ejection of the working environment of the technical system, calculated and experimental parameters. The article {{presents the results of}} the experimental investigation of a fast-acting feedwater shut-off valve of the steam generator RU BREST-OD- 300. The regularities of work of the pneumatic spring actuator for a pipeline are considered. Parameters and characteristics obtained by the conducted tests fully meet the requirements of ТС 37 - 089 - 70262486 - 2013. The closing time was 7 seconds.

50|$|The <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is a tube made {{of metal}} or rubber, {{through which the}} tire is inflated, with a check valve, {{typically}} a Schrader valve on automobiles and most bicycle tires, or a Presta valve on high-performance bicycles. <b>Valve</b> <b>stems</b> usually protrude through the wheel for easy access. They mount directly to the rim, {{in the case of}} tubeless tires, or {{are an integral part of}} the inner tube. The rubber in <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> eventually degrades, and, in the case of tubeless tires, replacement of the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> at regular intervals or with tire replacement reduces the chance of failure. Some may notice that their <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is all metal with a nut retaining it (as opposed to the typical rubber stem with brass threads). Most modern passenger vehicles are now required to have a tire pressure monitoring system which usually consists of a <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> attached to an electronic module. The module is hidden inside and is only visible when the tire has been removed from the wheel.|$|R

50|$|Gate valves are {{actuated}} by a threaded stem which {{connects the}} actuator (e.g. handwheel or motor) to the gate. They are characterised as having either a rising or a nonrising stem, {{depending on which}} end of the stem is threaded. Rising stems are fixed to the gate and rise and lower together as the valve is operated, providing a visual indication of valve position. The actuator {{takes the form of}} a nut which is rotated around the threaded stem to move it. Nonrising <b>stem</b> <b>valves</b> are fixed to, and rotate with, the actuator, and are threaded into the gate. They may have a pointer threaded onto the upper end of the <b>stem</b> to indicate <b>valve</b> position, since the gate's motion is concealed inside the <b>valve.</b> Nonrising <b>stems</b> are used underground or where vertical space is limited.|$|R
50|$|For certain {{applications}} the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> and disk {{are made}} of different steel alloys, or the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> may be hollow and filled with sodium to improve heat transport and transfer. Although a better heat conductor, an aluminium cylinder head requires steel valve seat inserts, where a cast iron cylinder head would often have employed integral valve seats in the past. Because the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> extends into lubrication in the cam chamber, it must be sealed against blow-by to prevent cylinder gases from escaping into the crankcase, even though the <b>stem</b> to <b>valve</b> clearance is very small, typically 0.04-0.06 mm, so a rubber lip-type seal is used to ensure that excessive oil is not drawn in from the crankcase on the induction stroke, and that exhaust gas does not enter the crankcase on the exhaust stroke. Worn valve guides and/or defective oil seals can often be diagnosed by a puff of blue smoke from the exhaust pipe on releasing the accelerator pedal after allowing the engine to overrun, when there is high manifold vacuum. Such a condition occurs when changing gear.|$|R

50|$|For {{motorcycle}} tires, {{a device}} {{similar to the}} internal beadlock of 4-wheel drive vehicles can be used. A special inner tube is inflated via its own <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> to high pressure to push the bead of the tire tight against the wheel. Like the rim lock, this clamps both beads at once. The regular <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is used to inflate the tire to the desired pressure.|$|R
50|$|High-lift {{safety valves}} are direct-loaded spring types, {{although}} the spring does not bear {{directly on the}} valve, but on a guide-rod <b>valve</b> <b>stem.</b> The <b>valve</b> is beneath {{the base of the}} stem, the spring rests on a flange some height above this. The increased space between the valve itself and the spring seat allows the valve to lift higher, further clear of the seat.

40|$|The {{researches}} {{have been}} carried out, where the object has been the set of two friction couples: <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> – <b>valve</b> guide and valve seat – seat insert. The camless driven valve has been common for each of such cases. The analyzed valve {{has been driven by}} magnetoelectrical drive. The special research stand has been elaborated and its scheme has been presented in the article. It has been measured the valve lift and valve acceleration, the impact force, the friction force, temperature values for valve guide and for seat insert, sound level during impacting on the stand. The aim of researches has been to determine the dynamic parameters, the friction force between <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> and <b>valve</b> guide, the impact force for valve impacting seat insert vs. frequency and valve lift. The analyzed valves have mated with seat inserts and valve guides made of cast iron, in oil absence. The valves have been made of TiAl 6 Zr 4 Sn 2 Mo 2 alloy. The researched friction couples have operated in temperature equal 293 K. The increase of frequency has resulted in small changes for values of lift and in greater changes of acceleration, during valve impact into its seat insert. The greatest values of impact force and acceleration have been for the small, middle and high values of valve lift, either. The ratio of impact force and valve acceleration has changed in thin bands. The friction force has decreased slightly with frequency increase and has decreased with valve lift increase. The sound level has increased with the frequency increase, and has not been dependent upon valve lift...|$|R
