40|$|Abstract Background In {{women with}} breast cancer {{submitted}} to neoadjuvant chemotherapy based in doxorubicin, tumor expression of groups of three genes (PRSS 11, MTSS 1, CLPTM 1 and PRSS 11, MTSS 1, SMYD 2) have classified them as responsive or resistant. We have investigated whether expression of these trios of genes could predict mammary carcinoma response in dogs and whether tumor slices, which maintain epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, {{could be used to}} evaluate drug response in vitro. Methods Tumors from 38 dogs were sliced and cultured with or without doxorubicin 1 μM for 24 h. Tumor cells were counted by two observers to establish a percentage variation in cell number, between slices. Based on these results, a reduction in cell number between treated and control samples ≥ 21. 7 %, arbitrarily classified samples, as drug responsive. Tumor expression of PRSS 11, MTSS 1, CLPTM 1 and SMYD 2, was evaluated by real time PCR. Relative expression results were then transformed to their natural logarithm values, which were spatially disposed according to the expression of trios of genes, comprising PRSS 11, MTSS 1, CLPTM 1 and PRSS 11, MTSS 1, SMYD 2. Fisher linear discrimination test was used to generate a <b>separation</b> <b>plane</b> between responsive and non-responsive tumors. Results Culture of tumor slices for 24 h was feasible. Nine samples were considered responsive and 29 non-responsive to doxorubicin, considering the pre-established cut-off value of cell number reduction ≥ 21. 7 %, between doxorubicin treated and control samples. Relative gene expression was evaluated and tumor samples were then spatially distributed according to the expression of the trios of genes: PRSS 11, MTSS 1, CLPTM 1 and PRSS 11, MTSS 1, SMYD 2. A <b>separation</b> <b>plane</b> was generated. However, no clear separation between responsive and non-responsive samples could be observed. Conclusion Three-dimensional distribution of samples according to the expression of the trios of genes PRSS 11, MTSS 1, CLPTM 1 and PRSS 11, MTSS 1, SMYD 2 could not predict doxorubicin in vitro responsiveness. Short term culture of mammary gland cancer slices may be an interesting model to evaluate chemotherapy activity. </p...|$|E

NASA's Constellation program comprises the Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles, the Orion crew vehicle, and the Altair lunar lander.

The water exchange through the harbour entrance can be described by turbulent momentum exchange coefficients measured in the <b>separation</b> <b>plane</b> between harbour and river. Transport and mixing can be described by the kinetic energy calculated from the measured velocities and turbulence. The comparison of the results of tracer measurements, the measured turbulent exchange through the entrance and the kinetic energy in the harbour show that in the investigated test cases with single-eddy-systems the water exchange is mainly controlled by the turbulent exchange through the entrance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} part of ACARP Project C 9003 (Green 2 ̆ 6 Ward, 2002) which examined the possibility of deriving quantitative guidelines {{for the use of}} sonic velocity logs in the identification of potential goaf delamination planes, with a view to improving predictive capability for the delineation of heavy roof conditions. The downhole sonic velocity log is widely used for the interpretation of overburden strata into geomechanical units and for identifying thick or strong sandstone layers in the main overburden. It can also depict discrete weaker horizons that can act as goaf delamination planes within such layers as high transit time (low velocity) spikes. However, delineation of these planes becomes subjective if the contrast between the peak velocity and the background velocity diminishes. In terms of predicting goafing behaviour the question then arises as to whether the potential for bed separation can be predicted {{on the basis of the}} sonic velocity contrast alone. There were no quantitative guidelines for using the sonic velocity log for this purpose. The research carried out under C 9003 was thus directed at establishing the value of the sonic log for the delineation of potential goaf delamination planes. The proposal was to systematically test sonic log responses for potential <b>separation</b> <b>planes</b> against monitored goafing behaviour from a number of mine sites, with the objective of deriving quantitative guidelines for the identification of goaf delamination planes from the sonic velocity log...|$|R
