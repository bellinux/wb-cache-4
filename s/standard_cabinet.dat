5000|$|Two major {{styles of}} the Beatmania cabinet were {{originally}} created, the <b>standard</b> <b>cabinet,</b> and the mini-style cabinet. The <b>standard</b> <b>cabinet</b> was taller and wider than the mini-style, and included a 29" [...] screen, versus the 20" [...] screen on the mini cabinet. The 1P/2P/Effect buttons {{were placed on the}} vertical face of the cabinet on the mini, while placed between the keys, ahead of the coin drop on standard cabinets. The mini-cabinet contained 6 speakers, 4 normal mid/high range, and 2 larger subs. The <b>standard</b> <b>cabinet</b> contained 10 speakers, including the 2 subs. Functionally the game boards, HDD, and romchips were the same between cabinets. Finally, the mini cabinet had a smaller spacing between the turntable and the keys, and the turntable was approximately half the diameter of the standard version. Today the mini-cabinet is much harder to find, especially in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|In rock music's {{early days}} in the early 1960s, PA systems were not very loud or powerful. As a result, 1960s rock bands {{typically}} used the PA system just for the vocals, {{even if they were}} playing at a large venue.

5000|$|In 1982, Celestion broke {{new ground}} in {{loudspeaker}} technology when they presented the SL6, a compact hi-fi speaker featuring {{the first ever}} metal dome tweeter, made of copper and designed {{with the help of}} laser interferometry. They followed this model up with the SL600, which used rigid honeycomb alloy called Aerolam instead of wood in the speaker casing; a material previously used only in the aerospace industry. Both these speaker models, while highly regarded as [...] "breakthrough" [...] designs with outstanding high-frequency clarity, are also known for a somewhat [...] "depressed" [...] sounding high-frequency range, {{as a result of the}} relatively heavy copper dome tweeter. Later iterations of this design deployed a similar tweeter, but with the dome made out of aluminum, a much lighter and more efficient driver, which allowed for a more balanced output with the woofer. The aluminium-domed versions, in the <b>standard</b> <b>cabinet</b> (MDF and wood veneer) were designated as the SL6s, and then (with an improved crossover and woofer surround) the SL6si; The aluminium-domed models using the Aerolam cabinet (the honeycomb alloy) were designated as the SL700 and the (improved) SL700SE which dual inputs—i.e., separate inputs for woofer and tweeter (allowing for bi-amping or bi-wiring). Around that same era, another version of the copper-domed model, with both the Aerolam cabinet and improved crossover elements, was marketed as the SL600si, also with dual inputs. Finally, in 1992, Celestion produced the final variation of this design, as the Ten Year [...] "Anniversary Edition" [...] Model 100, which featured a conventional, but highly refined MDF / wood veneer cabinet, dual inputs, updated mounted plates, an improved crossover, the improved woofer design, and a variation of the aluminium tweeter with an updated faceplate.|$|E
40|$|Faster, more {{powerful}} and dense computing hardware generates significant heat and imposes considerable data center cooling requirements. Traditional computer room air conditioning (CRAC) cooling methods are proving increasingly cost-ineffective and inefficient. Studies show that using the volume of room air as a heat exchange medium is wasteful and allows for substantial mixing of hot and cold air. Further, it limits cabinet/frame/rack density because it cannot effectively cool high heat density equipment that is spaced closely together. A more cost-effective, efficient solution for maximizing heat transfer and enabling higher heat density equipment frames {{can be accomplished by}} utilizing properly positioned ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂphase changeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ or ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtwo-phaseÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ pumped refrigerant cooling methods. Pumping low pressure, oil-free phase changing refrigerant through microchannel heat exchangers can provide up to 90 % less energy consumption for the primary cooling loop within the room. The primary benefits of such a solution include reduced energy requirements, optimized utilization of data center space, and lower OPEX and CAPEX. Alcatel-Lucent recently developed a modular cooling technology based on a pumped two-phase refrigerant that removes heat directly at the shelf level of equipment racks. The key elements that comprise the modular cooling technology consist of the following. A pump delivers liquid refrigerant to finned microchannel heat exchangers mounted on the back of equipment racks. Fans drive air through the equipment shelf, where the air gains heat dissipated by the electronic components therein. Prior to exiting the rack, the heated air passes through the heat exchangers, where it is cooled back down to the temperature level of the air entering the frame by vaporization of the refrigerant, which is subsequently returned to a condenser where it is liquefied and recirculated by the pump. All the cooling air enters and leaves the shelves/racks at nominally the same temperature. Results of a 100 kW prototype data center installation of the refrigerant-based modular cooling technology were dramatic in terms of energy efficiency and the ability to cool high-heat-density equipment. The prototype data center installation consisted of 10 racks each loaded with 10 kW of high-heat-density IT equipment with the racks arranged in a standard hot-aisle/cold-aisle configuration with <b>standard</b> <b>cabinet</b> spacing. A typical chilled-water CRAC unit would require approximately 16 kW to cool such a heat load. In contrast, the refrigerant-based modular cooling technology required only 2. 3 kW of power for the refrigerant pump and shelf-level fans, a reduction of 85 percent. Differences in hot-aisle and cold-aisle temperature were also substantially reduced, mitigating many issues that arise in purely air-based cooling systems, such as mixing of hot and cold air streams, or from placing high-heat-density equipment in close proximity. The technology is also such that it is able to retro-fit live equipment without service interruption, which is particularly important to the large installed ICT customer base, thereby providing a means of mitigating reliability and performance concerns during the installation, training and validation phases of product integration. Moreover, the refrigerant used in our approach, R 134 a, is a widely-used, non-toxic dielectric liquid which, unlike water, is non-conducting and non-corrosive and will not damage electronics {{in the case of a}} leakÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂa triple-play win over alternative water-based liquid coolant technologies. Finally, through use of a pumped refrigerant, pressures are modest (~ 60 psi), and toxic lubricants and oils are not required, in contrast to compressorized refrigerant systemsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂanother environmental win. Project Activities - The ARCTIC project goal was to further develop and dramatically accelerate the commercialization of this game-changing, refrigerant-based, liquid-cooling technology and achieve a revolutionary increase in energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction for our nationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure. The specific objectives of the ARCTIC project focused in the following three areas: i) advanced research innovations that dramatically enhance the ability to deal with ever-increasing device heat densities and footprint reduction by bringing the liquid cooling much closer to the actual heat sources; ii) manufacturing optimization of key components; and iii) ensuring rapid market acceptance by reducing cost, thoroughly understanding system-level performance, and developing viable commercialization strategies. The project involved participants with expertise in all aspects of commercialization, including research & development, manufacturing, sales & marketing and end users. The team was lead by Alcatel-Lucent, and included subcontractors Modine and USHose...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{legislative}} unity {{of government and}} opposition blocs in the Czech Chamber of Deputies {{over a period of}} twenty years. As voting unity is usually rather low in the Czech Republic, temporarily high concentrations of the respective blocks’ votes are linked to higher rates of conflict between the government and opposition. I use the Rice and UNITY indices to compare average unity scores of individual cabinets and also explorative time series of unity vectors in order to analyse bloc concentration, success rate, and increased conflict. The outcomes are relevant as both a case study and a methodological observation: (1) Broad differences in the logic of interaction are confirmed (e. g. caretaker cabinets show less conflict than <b>standard</b> <b>cabinets).</b> Although no universal trend (e. g. a transition from consensual to conflictual practice) is found, the Czech opposition became more concentrated and resorted to the tactics of serial blocking in the second decade; thus, a major change of behaviour occurred after all. (2) The Rice and UNITY indices correlate considerably; UNITY’s discrimination capacity is not distorted significantly despite the nature of equilibria in the Chamber. Moreover; the UNITY index is able easily to distinguish contested votes which are not detectable by the Rice index alone...|$|R
