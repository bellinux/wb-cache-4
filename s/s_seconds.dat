40|$|Abstract The Internet {{backbone}} of many corporations carries {{two kinds of}} traffic: urgent and delayable. Shifting some traffic from peak periods to valleys reduces capacity requirements. We {{consider the case of}} managing the delayable traffic by an admission control (AC) system. AC gets link utilization feedback every <b>s</b> <b>seconds.</b> Delayable opt-in sources obtain permission from AC to transmit for up to <b>s</b> <b>seconds</b> at a rate not exceeding a limit imposed by AC, renewing permission as needed. Urgent traffic bypasses AC. AC must allocate bandwidth to competing delayable traffic sources. We prove that among all throttling transformations of flows that achieve a desired mean aggregate flow, rate limits on flows minimize the variance of their sum. Furthermore, a single rate limit common to all flows achieves the optimum. Thus, for a single link, AC must decide on a single rate limit for all delayable sources in each s-second cycle. We evaluate different policies that set the rate limit dynamically in an empirical setting using netflow records on a link on the {{backbone of}} Yahoo!. Using historical data, we also derive the best possible reduction in capacity of this link using a closed-form solution to an assignment problem. We show that AC can achieve capacity reduction close to the best possible reduction...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether povidone-iodine has any incremental effect on peridural fibrosis in spinal surgery. Materials and methods: 24 albino rats were used for this experimental study. They were divided into three groups. In the first group (n= 8) only Th 8 -Th 12 laminectomy was performed (control group). In the second group (n= 8), laminectomy area was irrigated with 2. 5 % concentrated povidone-iodine for 30 <b>s</b> <b>seconds.</b> In the third group (n= 8), laminectomy area was irrigated with 10 % concentrated povidone-iodine for 30 seconds. In pathological specimens, fibrosis length and fibrosis area was calculated and compared between groups. Results: Peridural fibrosis length and fibrosis area didn't show statistically significant difference between all groups. Conclusion: Povidone-iodine has not increasing effect on peridural fibrosis so it may be safely used in spinal surgery when it is needed...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the blood pressure}} responses during recovery after two protocols of circuit resistance exercises (CRE) with different rest intervals (RI). Methods: Eleven normotensive males (aged 19. 5 ± 1. 0 yrs, height 172. 8 ± 5. 7 cm and weight 65. 1 ± 8. 1 kg) performed two CRE with RI of 30 (RI 30 s) and 40 (RI 40 <b>s)</b> <b>seconds</b> between the exercises randomly, {{as well as a}} control session without exercise. The protocols consisted of 3 circuits of 6 exercises with 10 repetitions maximum (10 RM) and 2 minute rest between circuits, followed by an 80 minute recovery period. Measurements were taken before exercise and at each 10 min of post-exercise recovery. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Repeated Measures (group × time) was used to analyze data, followed by post-hoc Bonferroni test, for P≤ 0. 05. Results: Post-exercise hypotension of systolic blood pressure was observed after both CRE with RI 30 s and RI 40 s (at R 40, R 50, R 60, R 70 and R 80), whereas diastolic blood pressure did not differ from that measured at rest.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the effects of}} local geological structure of the Osaka plain on earthquake ground motions, we observed seismic waves from local earthquakes at a soft soil site (WOS) in the Osaka bay area, a hard ground site (OSA) on diluvium in the Osaka Plain and a rock site (ABU) around {{the northern edge of}} the plain. We observed S waves reflected by the interface between a sedimentary layer and a basement rock at WOS and not at OSA. The reflected waves appear distinctly within 4 to <b>S</b> <b>seconds</b> after S arrivals. Their amplitudes reach about 60 to 80 % of S-wave amplitudes. When the duration of incident S waves on the reflection interface is longer than about 4 seconds, the principal part of S waves at WOS is elongated by the superposition of the reflected waves on the coda part of S waves. When we simulate seismograms as a 2 -D SH problem with a horizontally irregular interface, we can generate the reflected waves at WOS and not so clear at OSA. The amplitudes of the reflected waves simulated are about 50 % of S-wave amplitudes at most. This agrees with the observation for the appearance of the reflected waves. However, the simulation can not explain the large amplitudes of the reflected waves observed. This suggests that the reflected waves are strongly excited by focusing of rays due to the 3 -D irregular structure under WOS...|$|E
40|$|Mercury can {{induce a}} {{systemic}} autoimmune disease in susceptible mouse strains. H- 2 s mice are particularly susceptible to mercury-induced autoimmunity and other mouse strains {{are more or}} less resistant. T helper 1 /T helper 2 (Th 1 /Th 2) dichotomy has been proposed for resistance or susceptibility, respectively. In the current study we show that mercury treatment induced a full autoimmune response in both C 57 BL/ 6 (H- 2 b) wild-type and interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) -deficient mice. Antibody production of all isotypes were induced, except that in IL- 4 -deficient mice there was no immunoglobulin E (IgE) and very low levels of immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG 1) antibody synthesis. Autoantibodies of different specificities were produced. The granular pattern of all IgG subclasses deposits were detected in the kidneys. In contrast to mercury-treated H- 2 <b>s</b> <b>seconds</b> mice, we did not detect any anti-nucleolar autoantibodies in the sera of mercury-treated wild-type or IL- 4 -deficient mice. To further explore the role of Th 1 /Th 2 cytokines in the mercury model, we performed anti-interferon-γ antibody treatment in IL- 4 -deficient mice together with mercury treatment and found that the production of IgG 2 a and IgG 3, but not IgG 2 b, antibodies was downregulated. This indicated that besides Th 2 -type cytokines, Th 1 -type and other cytokines were involved as well in mercury-induced autoimmune response. Thus, C 57 BL/ 6 mice with H- 2 b genotype are highly susceptible to mercury-induced autoimmunity, and the genetic susceptibility to mercury involves more than a predisposition of a Th 1 -or Th 2 -type response...|$|E
