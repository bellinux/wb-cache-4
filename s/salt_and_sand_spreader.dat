E. spinosum undergoes a much milder cooking cycle, as it dissolves quite readily.

50|$|Prosopis flexuosa is {{endemic to}} arid regions of South America. Its range {{includes}} western Argentina, northern Chile {{and possibly the}} southern part of Bolivia. Its altitudinal range is from sea level to about 2200 m. It has two types of habitat, lowland dry forests and gallery forests. The annual rainfall within its range varies between about 50 and 500 mm. The tree is tolerant of drought, cold, <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> is the hardiest species in its genus. It is extremely efficient with water consumption, producing most of its fruits in drought years, and has been successfully introduced into other arid regions.|$|R

Salitre, in turn, is a composite of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and potassium nitrate (KNO3). Salitre was an important source of export revenue for Chile until World War I, when Europe began to produce both nitrates industrially in large quantities.|$|R

In Istria they were also used for fishing and in Dalmatia for pulling out sea sponges.|$|R
50|$|Snow and ice removal also {{decreases}} road slipperiness; snowploughs {{and snow}} blowers can remove the snow {{from the road}} surface while gritters drop road <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand,</b> which both melts the snow and ice from the road surface, and provide a rougher surface to grip onto. However, in dry conditions, <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> on the road surface can themselves increase road slipperiness and pose a danger to road traffic, and therefore, roads are cleared by street sweepers after roadworks and gritting {{to make sure that}} all the loose material is cleared from the road surface.|$|R
50|$|Dedicated surfcasters usually {{possess an}} array of {{terminal}} and other tackle, with fishing rods and reels of different lengths and actions, and lures and baits of different weights and capabilities. Depending on fishing conditions {{and the type of}} fish they are trying to catch, such surfcasters tailor bait and terminal tackle to rod and reel and the size and species of fish targeted. Reels and other equipment need to be constructed so they resist the corrosive and abrasive effects of <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand.</b>|$|R
50|$|It tolerates {{alkaline}} soil, <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand.</b> The leaves accumulate salts {{which helps}} extract {{water from the}} soil when other plants cannot. Salt is shed by dropping the leaves. It can live in up to 30 ppm Boron in solution, compared to most plants which can tolerate only about 1-5 ppm. As with other desert climate members of the Atriplex genus, it uses water conserving C4 photosynthetis, <b>and</b> it removes <b>salts</b> by having bladders in the leaves that keep the salt from the plant cells.|$|R

50|$|The main {{physical}} Weathering {{process on}} beaches is salt-crystal growth. Wind carries salt spray onto rocks, {{where it is}} absorbed into small pores and cracks within the rocks. There the water evaporates <b>and</b> the <b>salt</b> crystallises, creating pressure and often breaking down the rock. In some beaches calcium carbonate is able to bind together other sediments to form beachrock and in warmer areas dunerock. Wind erosion is also a form of erosion, dust <b>and</b> <b>sand</b> is carried around {{in the air and}} slowly erodes rock, this happens in a similar way in the sea were the <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand</b> is washed up onto the rocks.|$|R

40|$|Pavement marking is a {{delineation}} practice that, until recently, has {{not been}} emphasized as much as other forms of delineation. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is currently {{in the process of}} determining if there should be minimum retroreflectivity criteria for pavement markings. If these criteria become mandatory, road management agencies will be forced to understand the retroreflectivity of edge lines and centerlines and the retention of retroreflectivity with exposure to weather, snowplowing, road <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand,</b> <b>and</b> traffic density. The three key characteristics of greatest interest when selecting a marking material are: durability, retroreflectivity, and cost. This study examines how agencies in Missouri, Iowa, and Minnesota have implemented and evaluated their respective Pavement Marking Management Systems (PMMS). Whether it is through field studies, software development, or a consultant’s advice, these agencies are taking steps to better manage their delineation assets and reshape the state-of-the-practice. Conversely, Texas and Australia have documented deficiencies in their pavement marking management. From these case studies, lesson...|$|R
50|$|Plants {{that grow}} {{along the coast}} are very {{tolerant}} of the winds <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand</b> loaded ocean spray. Many species are succulent, storing salty water in their leaves. The leaves are often light colored or grey-green to reflect sunlight and reduce desiccation. Hairy leaves may reduce evapotranspiration, may help gather moisture from the air, and may reflect {{a small portion of}} incoming solar radiation thereby reducing the plants internal temperature. They are often very low in height with prostrate stems and spread by rooting at the nodes and may have deep tap roots, both rooting systems helping to anchor the shifting sands as the plants colonize the beach above high tide.|$|R

5000|$|... ==Coastal {{sand dune}} management== [...] Coastal sand dunes fringe {{thousands}} of Kilometres of coastline around the world. They {{are made up}} of continuous, hummocky hills of sand that are held together by specially adapted sand dune vegetation. [...] See Figure 1. These plants have adaptations that allow them to survive in sand dune habitats, these include adaptations to a moving substrate which covers and uncovers its roots, adaptation to desiccation, to strong winds carrying <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> to wildly changing temperatures. Coastal sand dunes formed during a time of low sea level where <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> sediments on the foreshore became exposed and in conjunction with sufficient winds, this sand was transported up the beach face via a process known as saltation. [...] Once sufficient wind (>15 km/hr) mobilises sand particles they become trapped in vegetation or drift wood {{at the back of the}} beach, sand then continues to accumulate among the vegetation and over time slowly builds up the dunes we see today. Sand dunes serve an important purpose by protecting inland areas from coastal water intrusion. They are able to absorb the impact and protect inland areas from high energy storms and act as a resilient barrier to the destructive forces of wind and waves.|$|R
