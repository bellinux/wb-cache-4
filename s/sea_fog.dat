Barré hoped to make use of a heavy <b>sea</b> <b>fog</b> that had descended, to break out from Venice and elude pursuit. Victorious had held off from the land during the fog and by the time Talbot was able to observe Venice harbour at 14:30, his opponent had escaped. Searching for Barré, who was sailing to Pula, Talbot spotted one of the French brigs at 15:00 and gave chase.|$|E

25|$|Valley {{areas such}} as the South Wales Valleys, due to their north-south orientation, receive less {{sunshine}} than lowland areas because the mountains {{on either side of the}} valley obscure the sun in the early morning and late evening. This is noticeable in winter where there are only a few hours of sunshine. The mountains of Wales, northern England and Scotland can be especially cloudy with extensive mist and fog. Near the coast, <b>sea</b> <b>fog</b> may develop in the spring and early summer. Radiation fog may develop over inland areas of Great Britain and can persist for hours or even days in the winter and can pose a major hazard for drivers and aircraft.|$|E
25|$|A Santa Ana fog is a {{derivative}} phenomenon {{in which a}} ground fog settles in coastal Southern California {{at the end of}} a Santa Ana wind episode. When Santa Ana conditions prevail, with winds in the lower two to three kilometers (1.25-1.8 miles) of the atmosphere from the north through east, the air over the coastal basin is extremely dry, and this dry air extends out over offshore waters of the Pacific Ocean. When the Santa Ana winds cease, the cool and moist marine layer may re-form rapidly over the ocean if conditions are right. The air in the marine layer becomes very moist and very low clouds or fog occurs. If wind gradients turn on-shore with enough strength, this <b>sea</b> <b>fog</b> is blown onto the coastal areas. This marks a sudden and surprising transition from the hot, dry Santa Ana conditions to cool, moist, and gray marine weather, as the Santa Ana fog can blow onshore and envelope cities in as quickly as fifteen minutes. However, a true Santa Ana fog is rare, because it requires conditions conducive to rapid re-forming of the marine layer, plus a rapid and strong reversal in wind gradients from off-shore to on-shore winds. More often, the high pressure system over the Great Basin, which caused the Santa Ana conditions in the first place, is slow to weaken or move east across the United States. In this more usual case, the Santa Ana winds cease, but warm, dry conditions under a stationary air mass continue for days or even weeks after the Santa Ana wind event ends.|$|E
500|$|Coastal SSTs {{can cause}} {{offshore}} winds to generate upwelling, which can significantly cool or warm nearby landmasses, but shallower waters over a continental shelf are often warmer. [...] Onshore winds {{can cause a}} considerable warm-up even in areas where upwelling is fairly constant, such as the northwest coast of South America.

500|$|The {{prevailing}} winds {{across the}} British Isles are westerlies bringing {{moisture from the}} Atlantic Ocean; {{this means that the}} west coast frequently receives strong winds and heavy rainfall while the east coast lies in a rain shadow behind the Pennines. As a result, Teesside and the Northumbrian coast are the driest regions in the North, with around [...] of rain per year, while parts of the Lake District receive over [...] Lowland regions in the more southern parts of Northern England such as Cheshire and South Yorkshire are the warmest, with average maximum July temperatures of over , while the highest points in the Pennines and Lake District reach only [...] The area has a reputation for cloud and fog – especially the east coast, which experiences a distinctive <b>sea</b> <b>fog</b> known as fret – although the Clean Air Act 1956 and decline of heavy industry have seen sunshine duration increase in urban areas in recent years.|$|E
500|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} affects {{the behavior of}} the Earth's atmosphere above, so their initialization into atmospheric models is important. [...] While sea {{surface temperature}} is important for tropical cyclogenesis, it is also important in determining the formation of <b>sea</b> <b>fog</b> and sea breezes. [...] Heat from underlying warmer waters can significantly modify an air mass over distances as short as [...] to [...] [...] For example, southwest of Northern Hemisphere extratropical cyclones, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow lake-effect snow (or sea effect) bands. Those bands bring strong localized precipitation, often in the form of snow, since large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences—larger than —between the water surface and the air above. Because of this temperature difference, warmth and moisture are transported upward, condensing into vertically oriented clouds which produce snow showers. The temperature decrease with height and cloud depth are directly affected by both the water temperature and the large-scale environment. The stronger the temperature decrease with height, the taller the clouds get, and the greater the precipitation rate becomes.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>fog</b> (also {{known as}} haar or fret) is heavily {{influenced}} {{by the presence of}} sea spray and microscopic airborne salt crystals. [...] Clouds of all types require minute hygroscopic particles upon which water vapor can condense. Over the ocean surface, the most common particles are salt from salt spray produced by breaking waves. Except in areas of storminess, the most common areas of breaking waves are located near coastlines, hence the greatest densities of airborne salt particles are there.|$|E

Norwich's position in East Anglia, jutting out into the North Sea can produce weather conditions that have less effect on other parts of the country, such as snow or sleet showers during the winter months on a northerly or easterly wind, or sea fog/haar during the summer half of the year.

60|$|A solitary man, {{with his}} figure carved out in sharp relief against the vaporous sky, {{stood on the}} highest point of the cliff. Everything in his {{attitude}} betokened the deepest dejection--in which {{at least he was}} in sympathy with his surroundings. His head drooped upon his bent shoulders, and his dark, weary eyes were fixed upon the rising <b>sea</b> <b>fog</b> in a vacant gaze.

60|$|Daylight {{was fast}} fading away; but {{the reign of}} {{twilight}} had not yet commenced. After a blustering morning, a sudden stillness had fallen upon the earth. The wild north wind had ceased its moaning in the pine trees, and no longer came booming across the level moorland. The dull gray clouds which all day long had been driven across the leaden sky in flying haste, hung low down upon the sad earth, and from over the water a <b>sea</b> <b>fog</b> rose to meet them. Nature had nothing more cheerful to offer than silence, a dim light, and indescribable desolation.|$|E
60|$|The wind {{suddenly}} {{shifted to}} the northeast, and the remnant of the <b>sea</b> <b>fog</b> melted in the blast.

No other form could be seen on the deck at all.|$|E

60|$|When {{the beauty}} of the fog first got hold of me, I {{wondered}} whether any one had given literary expression to its supreme charm. I searched the works of some of the better-known California poets, not quite without result. I was familiar with what seem to me the best of the serious verses of Bret Harte, the lines on San Francisco,--wherein the city is pictured as a penitent Magdalen, cowled in the grey of the Franciscans, --the soft pale grey of the <b>sea</b> <b>fog.</b> The literary value of the figure is hardly injured by the cold fog that the penitence of this particular Magdalen has never been of an enduring quality.
