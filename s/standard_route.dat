Today, aptly named State Route 49 travels through the Sierra Nevada foothills, connecting many Gold Rush-era towns such as Placerville, Auburn, Grass Valley, Nevada City, Coloma, Jackson, and Sonora. This state highway also passes very near Columbia State Historic Park, a protected area encompassing the historic business district of the town of Columbia; the park has preserved many Gold Rush-era buildings, which are presently occupied by tourist-oriented businesses.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 1626 the VOC ship 't Gulden Zeepaert (The Golden Seahorse) {{departed}} from Amsterdam with Nuyts and {{his eldest son}} Laurens aboard. Deviating from the <b>standard</b> <b>route</b> to the VOC's East Asian Batavia headquarters, the ship continued east and mapped around 1,500km of the southern coast of Australia from Albany, Western Australia to Ceduna, South Australia. The captain of the ship, François Thijssen, named the region ′t Landt van Pieter Nuyts (Pieter Nuyts' Land) after Nuyts, who was the highest-ranking official on the ship. Today several areas {{in the state of}} South Australia still bear his name, such as Nuyts's Reef, Cape Nuyts and the Nuyts Archipelago; names given by the British navigator and cartographer Matthew Flinders. Later Nuytsia floribunda, the Western Australian Christmas Tree, was also named for him.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a thesis}} about the spatial {{distribution}} of willow warbler, nightingale, blackbird, robin and grey flycatcher in Svealand and Götaland, that is the southern third of Sweden. It explores the possibilities of using statistics to describe the distribution and variation of birds in a given region. The data was collected by observation of birds on sites called <b>standard</b> <b>routes,</b> with 25 kilometres between them. The <b>standard</b> <b>routes</b> are the points in a grid net placed upon the map of Sweden. The purpose of <b>standard</b> <b>routes</b> is to represent the birds in Sweden both geographic and biotopological.

25|$|In 1863, {{the railway}} reached the downstream, New Passage shores {{on both sides}} of the river, and this became the <b>standard</b> <b>route.</b> The Old Passage, not {{connected}} to the railway, therefore lost much of its traffic. In 1886, the railway Severn Tunnel opened, broadly following the line of the New Passage, and this removed the demand for all ferries until the late 1920s, when the increase in motor vehicles, which were not well catered for by the railway operator, led to new demand for a crossing.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{first degree}} offered at English {{universities}} is the bachelor's degree with honours, which usually lasts for three years, although more vocational foundation degrees, typically lasting two years (or full-time equivalent) {{are also available}} in some institutions. Many institutions now offer an integrated master's degree, particularly in STEM subjects, as a first degree, which typically lasts for four years, {{the first three years}} running parallel to the bachelor's course. During a first degree students are known as undergraduates. The difference in fees between integrated and traditional postgraduate master's degrees (and that fees are capped at the first degree level for the former) makes taking an integrated master's degree as a first degree a more attractive option. Integrated master's degrees are often the <b>standard</b> <b>route</b> to chartered status for STEM professionals in England.|$|E

Teams are free to choose their partner team if multiple teams are present. Teams are not warned when an Intersection is coming. The Intersection may have teams simply working together on <b>standard</b> <b>Route</b> Marker tasks, or they may have to work together on Roadblocks or Fast Forwards. The first season of the Australian version featured two separate Intersections during its run, with the second Intersection having a unique set of penalties for quitting part way through the task.|$|E
25|$|When {{the college}} was opened in 1946, teacher {{training}} followed the <b>standard</b> <b>route</b> of two years, albeit initially taking a shorter {{time during the}} first few years as an emergency college. Courses available included rural studies, nature studies, handicraft, metalwork, physical education, mathematics, science, chemistry, music, geography, English, history, drama, art, religious studies, and infant education. As a result of the Robbins Report, the certificate was extended to three years, and in 1966, the first students of the Bachelor of Education (BEd) degree enrolled, graduating three years later in 1969, awarded by the University of Manchester. One of the most important subjects introduced was education studies, and a graduate course was introduced in the 1960s that would eventually become the PGCE, introduced in the 1970s. Further courses, including sociology, and European and American Studies were also introduced at this time. By the 1970s, courses in compensatory education and special needs had been introduced, in addition to in-service courses for qualified teachers. It was around this time that Didsbury students began to be taught by subject specialists, and the PGCE was organised by subject. In 1973, BEd students were offered a fourth year of studies to gain an honours degree, and in 1980 this became standard for all students. Teaching and learning through ICT became embedded in the 2000s. There was also a degree available in early childhood studies. The most recent courses introduced were youth work and social work.|$|E

Freeman stated, [...] "once the dramatic arc of the episode is established, it takes a fairly <b>standard</b> <b>route</b> ... the performance of Henstridge helps to bring enough emotion to give the storyline the weight that it needs". Kevin Fitzpatrick at Screen Crush called the episode [...] "inventive and unexpected" [...] and [...] "a brilliant gamble", praising Henstridge's performance and the [...] "immersive" [...] quality of the episode, especially the investment in Simmons' personal development with Daniels and attempts to escape the planet, which he felt was [...] "only occasionally marred by the required exposition of its more improbable elements".

40|$|The {{organization}} {{of public transportation}} in large cities is both an uneasy task and a very responsible one, due {{to the number of}} people and businesses depending on it. The goal of the Transport 4 U project is to make the {{organization of}} the public transport system more reliable and easier. One of the main benefits of this system is automatic purchasing of tickets. The system sends a variety of notifications to users, in the form of SMS. These notifications include: problems in the public transportation network, confirmation of ticket purchase, expiration of active tickets, etc. Over time, the system learns the <b>standard</b> <b>routes</b> of each user: journeys that a user takes frequently or periodically over the same segment of the transport network. These <b>standard</b> <b>routes</b> are taken into account during notifications, meaning that users are notified only about issues that affect them directly. Possible issues to the transport system include complete interruption of a transport line or modification of a line on an alternative route. The system also constantly attempts to optimize each user’s <b>standard</b> <b>routes,</b> sending out notification about possible faster alternative trips. The Transport 4 U system makes the experience of a public transport more pleasant to its users and to the public transport administrators. The system has an intuitive administration section...|$|R
