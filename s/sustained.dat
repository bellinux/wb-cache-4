40|$|The {{width of}} an address {{electrode}} {{is an important}} parameter to affect both the address and <b>sustain</b> discharge characteristics in AC-PDP. It is found numerically that as the width of an address electrode is wider, the capacitance between the <b>sustain</b> and address electrodes (CAY) increases but the capacitance between the two <b>sustain</b> electrodes (CXY) decreases. The resultant changes in the <b>sustain</b> and address discharge characteristics, such as a firing voltage, <b>sustain</b> voltage, discharge delay time and full-white luminance were examined in the 50 -in. ac-PDP with a high Xe (> 10 %) content. The increase in the address electrode width causes {{an increase in the}} firing and <b>sustain</b> voltage between the <b>sustain</b> electrodes, which are due to the decrease in the capacitance between two <b>sustain</b> electrodes and the increase in the wall charges accumulation toward the address electrode. In particular, the full-white luminance increases with an increase in the address electrode width. As the address electrode width becomes broaden, the <b>sustain</b> discharge path is lengthened toward the address electrode and the discharge volume is also enlarged. Therefore, the amount of the IR, VUV and Ne rays can be emitted considerably. 1...|$|R
