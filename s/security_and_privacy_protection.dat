Our signature scheme is provably secure under the DDH assumption and a variant of q-SDH assumption. With pre-computations, no exponentiation is required in our signature verification.

40|$|Abstract-Numerous {{cryptographic}} {{techniques have}} been developed to be used on mobile devices for various <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>protections.</b> However, these cryptographic primitives, working under different mathematical assumptions, tend to become more and more complex and intricate, which makes it increasingly more difficult for proper implementation and management. Thus, it is desired to simplify management and improve efficiency by means of designing a general function family to meet a variety of security requirements. In this paper, we present such a family of square functions, including SqHash, SqMAC and SqPRF, based on a specially truncated function (MSB or LSB). We further improve the efficiency of these algorithms by using "circular convolution with carry bits " which makes parallel processing possible. We prove the security of these functions based on the privacy in hidden number problem and hard-core predicate of one-way function. We also show that the proposed schemes achieve better performance with a complexity reduction from O(n 2) to O(knjw) for n·bit message, k·bit output and w·bit word size...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Data {{security}} has consistently {{been a major}} issue in information technology. In the cloud computing environment, it becomes particularly serious because the data is located in different places even in all the globe. Data <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>protection</b> are the two main factors of user’s concerns about the cloud technology. Though many techniques on the topics in cloud computing have been investigated in both academics and industries, data <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>protection</b> are becoming more important for the future development of cloud computing technology in government, industry, and business. Data <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>protection</b> issues are relevant to both hardware and software in the cloud architecture. This study is to review different security techniques and challenges from both software and hardware aspects for protecting data in the cloud and aims at enhancing the data <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>protection</b> for the trustworthy cloud environment.

40|$|Abstract — Wireless ad hoc {{networks}} are so vulnerable to passive attacks and eavesdropping adversaries {{due to their}} shared medium which makes network traffic easy to capture <b>and</b> analyze. Therefore, <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>protections</b> are of extreme importance for protocols and applications in such networks. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for anonymous routing, named chain-based routing, to improve the privacy. In our framework, nodes on a path are virtually bound to each other like a chain. Each node is only aware of its associated links in a flow and does not require any other information about source, destination, or {{other parts of the}} chain. Based on this framework, we propose an on-demand routing protocol, called Chain-based Anonymous Routing (CAR), which uses unicast-based broadcast data transfer to fulfill anonymous communication in wireless ad hoc networks. Through hiding identifiers of nodes inside the chain, CAR realizes sender, receiver, and relationship anonymity in addition to untraceability in the network. Moreover, it is resistant {{to a wide range of}} passive attacks while adapting to implement other security mechanisms in the presence of active attacks.

40|$|The {{vision of}} Ubiquitous Computing [22] creates {{the world in}} which {{information}} is omnipresent, migrating seamlessly through the environment to be accessible whenever and wherever needed. Such a vision poses substantial challenges to information <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>protection.</b> Unlike in traditional, static, execution environments, information in the Ubiquitous world is exposed, throughout its lifetime, to constantly varying security and privacy threats caused by the inherent dynamicity and unpredictability of the new computing environment and its mobility.

These shared infrastructures are being offered by infrastructure service providers which have subscription, or pay-on-demand, charge models presenting compute and storage resources as a generalized utility. Utility based infrastructures that are run by service providers have been defined as 2 ̆ 2 cloud computing 2 ̆ 2 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. In the cloud computing model the concerns of <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>protections</b> are exacerbated due to the requirement for an enterprise to allow third parties to own and manage the infrastructure and be custodians of the enterprises information. With this new architectural model, there are new hybrid governance models designed to support complex and uncertain environments. The cloud also requires a common infrastructure that integrates originally separate computing silos. <b>Privacy</b> <b>and</b> <b>security</b> policy awareness during provisioning and computing orchestration about data locality across domains and jurisdictions must be able to obey legal and regulatory constraints.
