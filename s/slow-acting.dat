5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a <b>slow-acting</b> poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by {{squeezing}} the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E
5|$|Poisoned bait is {{a common}} method for {{controlling}} rats, mice, birds, slugs, snails, ants, cockroaches and other pests. The basic granules, or other formulation, contains a food attractant for the target species and a suitable poison. For ants, a <b>slow-acting</b> toxin is needed so that the workers have time to carry the substance back to the colony, and for flies, a quick-acting substance to prevent further egg-laying and nuisance. Baits for slugs and snails often contain the molluscide metaldehyde, dangerous to children and household pets.|$|E
25|$|An insulin pump {{allows the}} {{replacement}} of <b>slow-acting</b> insulin for basal needs with a continuous infusion of rapid-acting insulin.|$|E
25|$|Abolitionists demanded {{immediate}} emancipation not a <b>slow-acting</b> containment. They {{rejected the}} new party, {{and in turn}} its leaders reassured voters they were not abolitionists.|$|E
25|$|The use of rapid-acting insulin for basal needs offers {{relative}} {{freedom from}} a structured meal and exercise regime previously needed to control blood sugar with <b>slow-acting</b> insulin.|$|E
25|$|Some {{micro-organisms}} degrade PCBs {{by reducing}} the C-Cl bonds. Microbial dechlorination tends to be rather <b>slow-acting</b> in comparison to other methods. Enzymes extracted from microbes can show PCB activity. In 2005, Shewanella oneidensis biodegraded {{a high percentage of}} PCBs in soil samples. A low voltage current can stimulate the microbial degradation of PCBs.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used immunosuppressants for maintenance therapy of Crohn's disease. They are purine anti-metabolites, meaning that they interfere with the synthesis of purines required for inflammatory cells. They have a duration of action of months (<b>slow-acting).</b> Both drugs are dosed at 1.5 to 2.5mg/kg, with literature supporting the use of higher doses.|$|E
500|$|As Alison, {{who managed}} to free herself, calls Lawrence at gunpoint again, she fights Zep for the gun. The {{struggle}} gets Tapp's attention, and he saves Alison and Diana and chases Zep to the sewers, where he is eventually shot in the chest during a struggle. Lawrence, aware only of gunshots and screaming, is electrically shocked as well and loses reach of the phone; in desperation, he saws off his foot and shoots Adam with the corpse's revolver. Zep enters the bathroom to kill Lawrence, stating that [...] "It's the rules", but Adam, who suffered only a flesh wound, overpowers Zep and bludgeons him to death with the toilet cover. As Lawrence crawls {{out of the room}} to find help, Adam searches Zep's body for a key and finds another microcassette recorder, which reveals that Zep was another victim, following the rules of his own game to obtain an antidote for a <b>slow-acting</b> poison in his body. As the tape ends, the [...] "corpse" [...] rises and is revealed to be Lawrence's patient John, the real Jigsaw killer. He reveals that the key to Adam's chain was in the bathtub he woke up in, which was drained when Adam awoke. Adam attempts to shoot John with Zep's gun, but John activates a remote, briefly electrocuting Adam. John shuts off the lights, while Adam screams in terror as John slams the door shut, leaving him to die.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his way to}} the Bandung conference, an {{assassination}} attempt was made against Zhou when a bomb was planted on the Air India plane Kashmir Princess, chartered for Zhou's trip from Hong Kong to Jakarta. Zhou avoided the attempt when he changed planes at the last minute, but all 11 of the flight's other passengers were killed, with only three crew members surviving the crash. A recent study has blamed the attempt on [...] "one of the intelligence agencies of the KMT." [...] Journalist Joseph Trento has also alleged that there was a second attempt on Zhou's life at the Bandung conference involving [...] "a bowl of rice poisoned with a <b>slow-acting</b> toxin." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{possible}} {{effect of}} Bell’s palsy is Wallerian Degeneration (WD), which may take days to become evident. [...] Because of the <b>slow-acting</b> {{nature of this}} pathology, a patient may present healthy electroneuronography results {{despite a lack of}} volitional control of the facial muscles immediately following the onset of Bell’s palsy. [...] This is because the degeneration has not yet reached completion, and some fibers are still intact. [...] Therefore, it is standard procedure to wait at least three days after symptoms present themselves to perform an electroneuronography test, in order to prevent false negatives. [...] At {{the other end of the}} spectrum, tests are generally not recommended after a period of twenty-one days. [...] Typically, electroneuronography recordings are taken on the third day of symptoms and repeated every four days until a plateau is reached.|$|E
2500|$|Sloths are {{classified}} as folivores, as {{the bulk of their}} diets consist of buds, tender shoots, and leaves, mainly of Cecropia trees. Some two-toed sloths have been documented as eating insects, small reptiles, and birds as a small supplement to their diets. Linnaeus's two-toed sloth has recently been documented eating human faeces from open latrines. They have made extraordinary adaptations to an arboreal browsing lifestyle. Leaves, their main food source, provide very little energy or nutrients, and do not digest easily. Sloths, therefore, have large, specialized, <b>slow-acting</b> stomachs with multiple compartments in which symbiotic bacteria break down the tough leaves. Sloths have the unique ability to protrude their tongues from their mouths , an ability that is useful for collecting leaves just out of reach. [...] As much as two-thirds of a well-fed sloth's body weight consists of the contents of its stomach, and the digestive process can take a month or more to complete.|$|E
2500|$|Modern geology, its sub-disciplines {{and other}} {{scientific}} disciplines utilize {{the scientific method}} to analyze the geology of the earth. The key tenets of flood geology are refuted by scientific analysis {{and do not have}} any standing in the scientific community. Modern geology relies on a number of established principles, {{one of the most important}} of which is Charles Lyell's principle of uniformitarianism. In relation to geological forces it states that the shaping of the Earth has occurred by means of mostly <b>slow-acting</b> forces that can be seen in operation today. By applying these principles, geologists have determined that the Earth is approximately 4.54 billion years old. They study the lithosphere of the Earth to gain information on the history of the planet. Geologists divide Earth's history into eons, eras, periods, epochs, and faunal stages characterized by well-defined breaks in the fossil record (see Geologic time scale). [...] In general, there is a lack of any evidence for any of the above effects proposed by flood geologists and their claims of fossil layering are not taken seriously by scientists.|$|E
2500|$|Paolo has imprisoned Fiesco. Determined to kill Boccanegra, Paolo pours a <b>slow-acting</b> poison {{into the}} Doge's water, and then tries to {{convince}} Fiesco to murder Boccanegra {{in return for}} his freedom. Fiesco refuses. Paolo next suggests to Adorno that Amelia is the Doge's mistress, hoping Adorno will murder Boccanegra in a jealous rage. Adorno is furious (Aria: Sento avvampar nell'anima – [...] "I feel a furious jealousy / Setting my soul on fire"). Amelia enters the Doge's apartments, seeming to confirm Adorno's suspicions, and he angrily accuses her of infidelity. She claims only to love him, but cannot reveal her secret – that Boccanegra is her father – because Adorno's family {{were killed by the}} Doge. Adorno hides as Boccanegra is heard approaching. Amelia confesses to Boccanegra that she is in love with his enemy Adorno. Boccanegra is angry, but tells his daughter that if the young nobleman changes his ways, he may pardon him. He asks Amelia to leave, and then takes a drink of the poisoned water, which Paolo has placed on the table. He falls asleep. Adorno emerges and is about to kill Boccanegra, when Amelia returns in time to stop him. Boccanegra wakes and reveals to Adorno that Amelia is his daughter. Adorno begs for Amelia's forgiveness (Trio: Perdon, Amelia... Indomito – [...] "Forgive me, Amelia... A wild, / Jealous love was mine"). Noises of fighting are heard – Paolo has stirred up a revolution against the Doge. Adorno promises to fight for Boccanegra, who vows that Adorno shall marry Amelia if he can crush the rebels.|$|E

50|$|The acid in {{a baking}} powder can be either {{fast-acting}} or <b>slow-acting.</b> A fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature, and a <b>slow-acting</b> acid will not react until heated in an oven. Baking powders that contain both fast- and <b>slow-acting</b> acids are double-acting; those that contain only one acid are single-acting. By providing a second rise in the oven, double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical, {{and this is the}} type most widely available to consumers today. Double-acting baking powders work in two phases; once when cold, and once when hot. Common low-temperature acid salts include cream of tartar and monocalcium phosphate (also called calcium acid phosphate). High-temperature acid salts include sodium aluminium sulfate, sodium aluminum phosphate, and sodium acid pyrophosphate. Despite very low acute toxicity, exposure to aluminum salts has raised concerns regarding potential neurotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|Men hunt in long, {{laborious}} tracking excursions. They {{kill their}} game using arrows and spears tipped in diamphotoxin, a <b>slow-acting</b> arrow poison produced by beetle larvae {{of the genus}} Diamphidia.|$|E
50|$|Hydramethylnon kills insects by disrupting energy {{production}} in their cells. Hydramethylnon is a <b>slow-acting</b> stomach poison (delayed toxicity) {{that does not}} need to be eaten to be effective. It is toxic to cockroaches both by topical application and by ingestion. Hydramethylnon residues are much less active against cockroaches by contact than by ingestion. A <b>slow-acting</b> poison is desirable, so they live long enough to return to the colony to share it with other cockroaches. In this way cockroaches that have eaten Hydramethylnon infect other cockroaches that have not had direct exposure to the baits. Hydramethylnon is known to cause cancer in rats, particularly uterine and adrenal tumours and lung cancer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{safety of}} the food may be {{determined}} by observing {{whether or not the}} food taster subsequently becomes ill. However, food tasting would not be effective against <b>slow-acting</b> poisons that {{take a long time to}} show any visible symptoms.|$|E
50|$|The insulin pump replaces insulin injections. This {{device is}} useful for people who {{regularly}} forget to inject themselves or for people who don't like injections. This machine does the injecting by replacing the <b>slow-acting</b> insulin for basal needs with an ongoing infusion of rapid-acting insulin.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{complaints}} expressed by protests during the 2008 Greek riots was the government's fast action in {{acting on behalf of}} OPAP to remove competition, whereas for issues affecting public safety or the rights of the people the government has been popularly thought to be <b>slow-acting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the last}} word in this subgenre is D.O.A. (1950), where a man dying from a <b>slow-acting</b> poison has to solve his own murder in the hours he has left. This film was remade in 1969 as Color Me Dead and again as D.O.A. in 1988.|$|E
50|$|The {{untethered}} regimen is {{a technique}} combining {{the use of an}} insulin pump with a <b>slow-acting</b> insulin analog such as Lantus or Levemir. This allows an insulin dependent person to disconnect the pump when desired while maintaining the flexible benefits that the insulin pump can provide.|$|E
50|$|Diabetics {{and health}} care {{professionals}} use bolus {{to refer to a}} dosage of fast-acting insulin with a meal (as opposed to basal rate, which is a dose of <b>slow-acting</b> insulin or the continuous pumping of a small quantity of fast-acting insulin to cover the glucose output of the liver).|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{the timing}} of {{application}} {{may play a role}} in the effectiveness of the herbicide, as well as the perception of effectiveness. For instance, fall is usually the best time for use of broadleaf herbicides; however, a <b>slow-acting</b> herbicide like triclopyr applied in the fall may not appear to have been effective until the next growing season.|$|E
5000|$|Known informally as [...] "Tiddy." [...] A Population Police officer {{whose life}} is saved by Matthias in Among the Enemy. He helps Matthias {{as much as}} possible, but dies hours after signing Matthias up for the Population Police. He was killed after he confiscated fake ID cards {{that turned out to}} be coated in <b>slow-acting</b> poison.|$|E
5000|$|Basal {{when used}} in a medical sense refers to a minimal level that is {{necessary}} for health or life. As used by diabetics and health care professionals, it describes a low, continuous dosage of insulin (either as a basal rate from an insulin pump or a <b>slow-acting</b> insulin injection) intended to [...] "cover" [...] the glucose output of the liver.|$|E
50|$|Stimulants are {{typically}} formulated in fast and <b>slow-acting</b> {{as well as}} short and long-acting formulations. The fast-acting amphetamine mixed salts (Adderall) and its derivatives, with short and long-acting formulations bind to the trace amine associated receptor and triggers the release of dopamine into the synaptic cleft. They may have a better cardiovascular disease profile than methylphenidate and potentially better tolerated.|$|E
50|$|During repolarization, {{the sodium}} {{channels}} begin to become inactivated, causing a net efflux of potassium ions. This causes the membrane potential to drop {{down to its}} resting membrane potential of -100mV. Hyperpolarization occurs because the <b>slow-acting</b> potassium channels take longer to inactivate, so the membrane overshoots the resting potential. It gradually returns to resting potential and is ready for another action potential to occur.|$|E
