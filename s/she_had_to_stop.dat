5|$|In February 1892, Sperber {{left for}} another {{overhaul}} in Sydney. While en route, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> at Tabiteuea in the Gilbert Islands {{and send a}} landing party ashore to punish locals who had attacked German businessmen there. The overhaul lasted from 3 March to 3 May, after which Sperber went on another tour of the islands, including the Marshalls, Butaritari, and Matupit Island. At Matupit the Deputy Chancellor, Georg Schmiele, came aboard the ship. Sperber was back in Apia by 17 May, and she remained there until 1 November, when she left for another tour, which included stops at Nukufetau, Herbertshöhethe capital of German New Guineaand Friedrich Wilhelmshafen. Another period of dockyard work at Sydney followed from 6 February 1893 to 18 April. In the meanwhile, unrest in Samoa broke out, {{under the leadership of}} King Mata'afa Iosefo. He was arrested, however, which caused the movement to disperse; after she returned from Sydney, Sperber was tasked with taking Mata'afa into exile on Jaluit Atoll.|$|E

25|$|On 4 July 1798, Lodi, was sailing {{down the}} Piombino Channel from Leghorn with dispatches for Napoleon Bonaparte, then at Alexandria. She {{encountered}} a British brig that attacked {{her and the}} two vessels exchanged fire. The crew of the brig twice attempted to board Lodi and twice the French repelled them. The French then attempted to board the brig, and the British repelled them. The two vessels separated and continued to exchange fire, with the French succeeding in bringing down the brig's masts. Even so, the French did not capture the brig, which used sweeps to reach the neutral coast of Tuscany, where it took refuge by a fort. Lodi, although she had retained her masts, was sufficiently damaged that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> at Civita Vecchia to effect repairs. Lodi then continued on to Alexandria. Lodi had lost two men killed and more than 25 sailors and soldiers wounded, including Sennequier.|$|E

"Sorry" [...] {{was written}} by Ciara, who was {{credited}} to her full birth name Ciara Princess Harris, Elvis Williams, and Jasper Cameron, and was produced by Harris and Cameron at Royaly Rightings and Universal Music Corporation in Santa Monica, California.

On August 25, 2012, while speaking to Claudia Jordan on Centric's The Hot 10, Ciara described [...] "Sorry" [...] as a [...] "very, very real record," [...] {{and went on to}} tell Essence magazine that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> herself from crying while writing the song. Although Ciara never confirmed who the song was about, she assured it wasn't about ex-boyfriend Amar'e Stoudemire.

In response, Bernard d'Ormale, Bardot's husband, said this was not true and declared: [...] <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> say everything to make news about her.

2500|$|In {{the latter}} 20th century, {{a number of}} artists tried {{to bring back the}} {{technique}} as an art form. Painter and tapestry weaver Carmen Padin began researching the technique after hearing Fernando Gamboa lament its loss. From 1979 to 1981, she exhibited her work in various cities of Mexico which included robes, capes, shields and collages. However, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> by the 1990s because of the difficultly of obtaining feathers. Josefina Ortega Salcedo became attracted to the technique after reading about it in the Artes de México magazine. She studied drawing and painting at the Academy of San Carlos with the goal of applying them to feather work. Her most valuable work in this medium includes several portraits, copied from photographs with precision. Her images are placed on a base of light-colored feathers with the images arranged using crepe paper cut outs and colored feathers. [...] However, she, too, no longer works with this technique. Those who still continue to work with it include Elena Sanchez Garrido, who combines feather work and watercolors, and Tita Bilbaro who makes Aztec and modern style images using feathers, sand, fabric, leather, mirrors an sea shells. In the late 1980s she exhibited her work in Mexico City and several places in northern Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Like her {{brothers}} and sisters, {{she had an}} interest in the theatre. [...] She spent time at Drury Lane, where her father was manager, and in 1729, when she was sixteen, she was courted by the composer and violinist Richard Charke, and the two were married on 4 February 1730. [...] Once married, Charlotte, no longer a minor to her parents, began to appear on stage. [...] She made her debut on 8 April 1730 in the stereotypically ultra-feminine minor role of Mademoiselle in The Provok'd Wife, by John Vanbrugh, at Drury Lane. [...] <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> performing soon thereafter, however, when she discovered that she was pregnant. [...] Her daughter, Catherine (also known as Kitty), was born in December 1730. By June 1731, Charlotte was back on stage as Lucy in The London Merchant by George Lillo. [...] In July of that year she made her first appearance in a breeches role as Tragedo in the same play and followed that the next year with Roderigo in Othello. Charlotte also became fascinated and quite talented at playing travesty [...] roles, male roles played by women. She would later appear as Mrs. Slammerkin in The Beggar's Opera and the tomboyish Hoyden in The Relapse. Around this time, Charke began wearing male clothing off the stage as well, although intermittently.|$|E
2500|$|By Saturday, the {{infection}} had died down, and she flew to Kona. On Sunday Wellington published a blog post {{in which she}} referred to Sun Tzu's book The Art of War and elaborated on how war strategy {{could be applied to}} triathlon, saying that she hadn't lost her fight because of her injuries and quoting Bella Bayliss's dictum that [...] "It's not a race, it's war." [...] The flight had caused her leg to swell up again, but she was still able to do some bike and run training. On Monday she tried a four-kilometre swim, her first hard swim since the crash; this produced pain in her pectoral muscle, which worsened over subsequent training sessions. On Tuesday she tried another swim session: after 1km <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> and again had to be lifted out of the pool by Lowe. She later wote, [...] "I was 'crying into my goggles', and described the pain as 'unbearable'", adding, [...] "I was convinced I'd broken my rib. Every breath hurt and I couldn't move my arm properly." [...] The previous day Mike Leahy had begun treating Wellington using his Active Release Therapy (ART); he instructed her {{to go to the hospital}} for tests, not wanting to continue ART treatment if the problem was a fracture. The hospital's first concern, from the swollen state of her leg, was that she might have a pulmonary embolism. Six hours of tests showed that she had no fractures, nor any embolism, but that she did have damaged pectoral and intercostal muscles; the badly infected state of her leg was obvious from the appalling smell when the bandages were removed.|$|E
