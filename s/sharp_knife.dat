5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} silk {{was found at}} the sites of Yangshao culture in Xia County, Shanxi, where a silk cocoon was found cut in half by a <b>sharp</b> <b>knife,</b> dating back to between 4000 and 3000 BCE. The species was identified as Bombyx mori, the domesticated silkworm. Fragments of primitive loom {{can also be seen}} from the sites of Hemudu culture in Yuyao, Zhejiang, dated to about 4000 BCE. The earliest example of silk fabric is from 3630 BC, and was used as wrapping for the body of a child. The fabric comes from a Yangshao site in Qingtaicun at Rongyang, Henan. Scraps of silk were found in a Liangzhu culture site at Qianshanyang in Huzhou, Zhejiang, dating back to 2700 BCE. Other fragments have been recovered from royal tombs in the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 – c. 1046 BCE).|$|E

The murder weapon and Patterson's breasts have never been recovered.|$|E
25|$|Each seed is clasped {{by a thin}} wing 2 to 4 {{times as}} long as the seed. Seed and wing are appressed to the cone scale. Embryo and {{megagametophyte}} are soft and translucent at first; later the endosperm becomes firm and milky white, while the embryo becomes cream-colored or light yellow. At maturity, the testa darkens rapidly from light brown to dark brown or black (Crossley 1953). Mature seed “snaps in two” when cut by a <b>sharp</b> <b>knife</b> on a firm surface (Crossley 1953).|$|E
25|$|It was {{cut into}} three {{sections}} on 10February1908 by Asscher Brothers of Amsterdam and eventually into nine large stones {{and a number}} of smaller ones. At the time, technology had not yet evolved to guarantee the quality of modern standards, and cutting the diamond was difficult and risky. To enable Asscher to cleave the diamond in one blow an incision half an inch (1.27cm) deep was made. Then a <b>sharp</b> <b>knife</b> was placed in the incision and the diamond was split clean in two with a piece of steel along one of four possible cleavage planes. The Cullinan split through a defective spot which was shared in both halves of the diamond.|$|E

In the first Detour of the race, teams was a choice between <b>Sharp</b> <b>Knives</b> and <b>Sharp</b> Eyes; both detours {{required}} teams to head to Ucluelet Harbour. In <b>Sharp</b> <b>Knives,</b> teams had to watch a demonstration, and then correctly fillet at least 30 lbs kg of fish to receive their next clue. Teams had {{a limited amount of}} fish. If they ran out without reaching the target they must switch detour options or take a penalty. In Sharp Eyes, teams had to sort through 1,000 lbs kg of assorted Pacific rockfish and separate them into five bins.|$|R
25|$|Ploughing leaves {{very little}} crop residue on the surface, which {{otherwise}} could reduce both {{wind and water}} erosion. Over-ploughing {{can lead to the}} formation of hardpan. Typically farmers break up hardpan up with a subsoiler, which acts as a long, <b>sharp</b> <b>knife</b> to slice through the hardened layer of soil deep below the surface. Soil erosion due to improper land and plough utilisation is possible. Contour ploughing mitigates soil erosion by ploughing across a slope, along elevation lines. Alternatives to ploughing, such as the no till method, have the potential to actually build soil levels and humus. These may be suitable to smaller, more intensively cultivated plots, and to farming on poor, shallow or degraded soils that ploughing would further degrade.|$|E
500|$|Editor Nick Lowe noticed theater posters done by Scott McKowen {{and decided}} that the [...] "engraving 'look' of the {{scratchboard}} would be interesting for the historical setting of this story." [...] Scratchboard is a technique where a <b>sharp</b> <b>knife</b> is used to scrape through a layer of black ink to a hard chalk surface underneath; in effect, artists draw white lines on an all-black surface. All McKowen's illustrations were done by hand and then colored later in Photoshop. For inspiration, McKowen looked at seventeenth-century engravings. He also added scrolls or flags to the covers for the Marvel 1602 titles, basing the designs on Renaissance paintings where scrolls are used {{to comment on the}} scenes depicted.|$|E
500|$|In Iron Age and Early Medieval Northern Europe, {{the term}} blót {{referred}} to animal sacrifice performed {{to thank the}} deities and gain their favor. Such sacrifices have generally proved impractical for most modern practitioners, {{due to the fact}} that skills in animal slaughter are not widely taught, while the slaughter of animals is regulated by government in Western countries. In 2007 Strmiska noted that a [...] "small but growing" [...] number of Heathen practitioners in the U.S. had begun performing animal sacrifice as a part of blót. Those who do so typically follow the procedure outlined in the Heimskringla: the throat of the sacrificial animal is slashed with a <b>sharp</b> <b>knife,</b> and the blood is collected in a bowl before being sprinkled onto both participants of the rite and statues of the gods. Animals used for this purpose have included poultry as well as larger mammals like sheep and pigs, with the meat then being consumed by those attending the rite. Some practitioners have made alterations to this procedure: Strmiska noted two American Heathens who decided to use a rifle shot to the head to kill the animal swiftly, a decision made after they witnessed a blót in which the animal's throat was cut incorrectly and it slowly died in agony; they felt that such practices would have displeased the gods and accordingly brought harm upon those carrying out the sacrifice.|$|E

500|$|Mammals and fowl must be {{slaughtered}} by {{a trained}} individual (a shochet) using a special method of slaughter, shechita (...) [...] Among other features, shechita slaughter severs the jugular vein, carotid artery, esophagus, and trachea {{in a single}} continuous cutting movement with an unserrated, <b>sharp</b> <b>knife.</b> Failure {{of any of these}} criteria renders the meat of the animal unsuitable. The body must be checked after slaughter to confirm that the animal had no medical condition or defect that would have caused it to die of its own accord within a year, which would make the meat unsuitable. These conditions (treifot) include 70 different categories of injuries, diseases, and abnormalities whose presence renders the animal non-kosher. It is forbidden to consume certain parts of the animal, such as certain fats (chelev) and the sciatic nerves from the legs, the process of excision being done by experts before the meat is sold. As much blood as possible must be removed (...) through the kashering process; this is usually done through soaking and salting the meat, but the liver, as it is rich in blood, is grilled over an open flame. Fish (and kosher locusts, for those who follow the traditions permitting them) must be killed before being eaten, but no particular method has been specified in Jewish law. Legal aspects of ritual slaughter are governed not only by Jewish law but civil law as well.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{synopsis of}} the film {{was published in the}} Moving Picture World as follows: [...] "Professor Dix has won fame as a scientist and has collected many objects of Egyptian ware, centuries old, that arouse the enthusiasm of his associates. Even Jack Thornton, an active, go-ahead young businessman, is interested in the professor's home, but although he tries to pretend it is Egyptology which interests him, the professor's fair young daughter is really the lodestone. Jack decides to win the old man's respect by posing as an Egyptologist himself. To start his collection, he purchases a mummy at an auction sale, and takes it home expecting that later he can make a great hit with his sweetheart's father, by presenting it to him as a gift. While the mummy is in Jack's room, a live electric wire is by accident brought in contact with it. The body has been so perfectly mummified, that the electric current is all that is necessary to ignite the vital spark, and Jack is amazed to see dancing forth from the case which he thought contained only unattractive rags and bones, a beautiful Egyptian princess. As soon as she is released, the mummy makes violent love to Jack, and causes his sweetheart to quarrel with him (for how can a plain businessman explain the presence in his room of a beautiful barbarian?). When her love is spurned, the visitor from the distant past avenges herself by having Jack made into a mummy and placed in the case in her stead. Her heart relents, however, in time to save him from being 'cut up' by the professor, who with the <b>sharp</b> <b>knife,</b> starts to investigate the contents of the mummy case. But all ends happily when Jack's plain statements of the seemingly impossible facts are proved true by the professor. Jack is reunited to his sweetheart, and the professor, being a widower, also an ardent admirer of everything antique, leads the recreated Egyptian lady to the altar, {{in spite of the fact}} that there is a difference of several thousand years in their ages." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beak {{trimming}} {{was developed}} at the Ohio Experiment Station in the 1930s. [...] The original technique was temporary, cutting approximately 6mm (1/4 inch) off the beak. It was thought that {{the tip of the}} beak had no blood supply and presumably no sensation. The procedure was performed by hand with a <b>sharp</b> <b>knife,</b> either when deaths due to cannibalism became excessive, or when the problem was anticipated because of a history of cannibalism in the particular strain of chicken.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2009, {{security}} features were increased on [...] "Machin" [...] self-adhesive stamps {{to avoid the}} reuse of uncancelled used stamps retrieved on mail. Both the effigy and the background were printed with continuous [...] "ROYAL MAIL" [...] iridescent printing. Two ellipsoidal shear panels were added to each stamp, and the water-soluble layer between the stamp and the adhesive was abandoned. These two later features were intended to render the stamps difficult to take off mail and to store for reuse (but in effect are easily overcome by the careful use of a <b>sharp</b> <b>knife</b> edge). Collectors are advised not to attempt to soak such stamps off, but to save them on pieces cut from the envelope.|$|E

2500|$|A {{distinction}} {{may be made}} {{based on}} whether the defendant chose to become intoxicated, and is thus responsible for their diminished control, or not. As an example, in the so-called Dutch courage defense (see the Gallagher case in English law on intoxication) the accused hates his spouse but fears to take action. The accused therefore buys a bottle of brandy and a <b>sharp</b> <b>knife.</b> In the morning, the bottle is empty and the knife is in the spouse's heart. Because the accused had a plan and weakening the inhibitions by drunkenness {{was a part of}} that plan, an intoxication defense is not feasible. But if, at a party, a bowl of fruit punch is [...] "spiked" [...] by someone who secretly adds gin, the resulting drunkenness is not voluntary and might be considered a possible defense.

It {{was to be the}} place where she was last seen alive. She left at approximately 11.20pm, planning to meet friends again later, and started the 15-minute walk home. It is believed that she argued with a man described as being in his mid 20s an estimated 25 minutes after leaving the pub in the laneway between Silchester Road and her home in Silchester Park. Witnesses heard a female voice expressing a cry of [...] "leave me alone", [...] "go away" [...] or something similar. [...] "Fuck off" [...] was also heard. This was followed by a scream. Raonaid was stabbed four times in the side, chest and shoulder with a one-and-a-half-inch <b>sharp</b> <b>knife</b> while in Silchester Crescent.

2500|$|After the Council, Paul VI contributed in {{two ways}} to the {{continued}} growth of ecumenical dialogue. The separated brothers and sisters, as he called them, {{were not able to}} contribute to the Council as invited observers. After the Council, many of them took initiative to seek out their Catholic counterparts and the Pope in Rome, who welcomed such visits. But the Catholic Church itself recognized from the many previous ecumenical encounters, that much needed to be done within, to be an open partner for ecumenism. To those who are entrusted the highest and deepest truth and therefore, so Paul VI, believed that he had the most difficult part to communicate. Ecumenical dialogue, in the view of Paul VI, requires from a Catholic the whole person: one's entire reason, will, and heart. Paul VI, like Pius XII before him, was reluctant to give in on a lowest possible point. And yet, Paul felt compelled to admit his ardent Gospel-based desire to be everything to everybody and to help all people Being the successor of Peter, he felt the words of Christ, [...] "Do you love me more" [...] like a <b>sharp</b> <b>knife</b> penetrating to the marrow of his soul. These words meant to Paul VI love without limits, and they underscore the Church's fundamental approach to ecumenism.|$|E
