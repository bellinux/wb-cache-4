2500|$|Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) {{were once}} very {{numerous}} in western United States and were an important food source for humans. The [...] "Sheepeaters", {{a band of}} Shoshone people, lived year-round in Yellowstone until 1880. Their principal food was bighorn sheep and they made their bows from <b>sheep</b> <b>horns.</b> By 1900, during an [...] "epoch of relentless destruction by the skin hunters", bighorn numbers were reduced to a few hundred in the United States. In 1897 about 100-150 were estimated {{to be present in}} the park. By 1912, despite a disease (scab) contracted from domestic sheep, bighorns in the park had increased to more than 200 and travelers could find them with fair certainty by devoting a few days to searching around Mount Everts, Mount Washburn or other well-known ranges. In winter, small bands of sheep could then be seen every day between Mammoth and Gardiner. Bighorn sheep usually live 10–15 years in the wild.|$|E
2500|$|There are twelve golden Gatekeys that summon {{spirits of}} the , {{which are based on}} the zodiacal constellations. These spirits are more {{powerful}} than the others, and require their master to use a large amount of magic energy to summon them. They are led by Leo, the true form of Loke. Aquarius is a foul-tempered mermaid who uses an urn that unleashes massive torrents of water on her target. Taurus is a perverted, minotaur-like humanoid who wields a giant, double-edged battle axe and has superhuman strength. Cancer is a humanoid hairdresser with six crab legs protruding from his back, and wields a pair of scissors. Virgo, a masochistic woman dressed like a maid, burrows rapidly underground and manipulates earth. Sagittarius is a tall man who wears a horse costume and possesses superb archery skills. Aries, a timid young woman with <b>sheep</b> <b>horns,</b> who wears a wool coat, conjures wool clouds that subdue her opponents. Gemini are small twin spirits who mimic the appearances and abilities of others, and can also read their minds. Scorpio is a man with a scorpion tail-shaped cannon that produces sandstorms. Capricorn is an anthropomorphic goat who dresses like a butler. Pisces are a mother and son pair of giant fish who attack their opponent in tandem, and can take on a human form and their weakness is water. Libra, a thinly-dressed woman, is able to manipulate gravity using a pair of weigh scales. Another spirit called , which {{takes the form of a}} giant mechanical snake, is considered the [...] "thirteenth" [...] zodiac spirit and surpasses the other twelve in power.|$|E

5000|$|The Racka is a {{breed of}} sheep known for its unusual spiral-shaped horns, {{resembling}} those of the wild markhor. These unique appendages are unlike any other domestic <b>sheep</b> <b>horns,</b> and may grow up to 2.0 ft long. The smallest standard length is 20 in for rams and 12 - 15 in for ewes.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the modern}} era, {{in some areas}} of the Alps, a goat or <b>sheep's</b> <b>horn</b> would be {{sharpened}} and a tin panel would be punched out using the alphabet and numbers from one to nine.

5000|$|The cornicello, [...] "little horn", {{also called}} the cornetto ("little horn", plural cornetti), is a long, gently twisted horn-shaped amulet. Cornicelli are usually carved out of red coral or made from gold or silver. The type of horn they are {{intended}} to copy is not a curled-over <b>sheep</b> <b>horn</b> or goat horn but rather like the twisted horn of an African eland or a chili pepper.|$|R
50|$|The Bannock made pottery, {{utensils}} from mountain <b>sheep</b> <b>horns,</b> {{and carrying}} bags from salmon skin. Their petroglyphs date back before European contact, and, after {{the introduction of}} glass beads, they transferred their geometric design to beadwork. For water transport, they made tule reed rafts. Prior to the late 19th century, Bannock people fished for salmon on the Snake River in Idaho and in the fall, they hunted buffalo herds. Buffalo hides provided material for tipis.|$|E
50|$|A {{small stone}} pagoda-like {{structure}} is also sometimes {{built on the}} roof of a house, and a pottery jar that contains five varieties of grain is placed within the pagoda. On top of the pagoda, a white stone is placed together with ox and <b>sheep</b> <b>horns.</b> By tradition, the door of a Qiang house is supposed to face south and the pagoda is built on the northern end of the roof in line with the door. Every morning, the Qiang family will burn incense sticks or cedar twigs in the pagoda and kneel to it, praying {{for the protection of the}} family by the god of the white stone.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{significant}} artifacts recovered during the excavation were usually found {{in one of}} 31 cache pits dug into the cave floor by the inhabitants. The pits were lined with worn-out baskets, pieces of baskets, or grass. Cache 13 in particular, called by excavators the [...] "shaman's cache," [...] yielded a birdskin robe, pouches, waterfowl bones and skins, hawk feathers and a stuffed canvasback duck head. The robe was believed to have originally been feathered, the feathers having been extensively damaged by insects while buried. Heizer speculated that the cache's contents might have been curative tokens, or could simply {{have been used to}} make decoys. A number of shaped sickles fashioned from bighorn <b>sheep</b> <b>horns</b> were also recovered.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{suggest that}} the word [...] "sheep" [...] may refer to another species of animal that resembled sheep such as big <b>horn</b> <b>sheep</b> or llamas. Critics point out that big <b>horn</b> <b>sheep</b> have never been domesticated by humans.|$|R

50|$|There were a {{total of}} 269 items in this category, broken down into four sub-categories: awls, pendants, whistles, and sheep horn wrenches. The awls were {{classified}} according {{to the degree of}} point taper and how the bone fragment was modified. They were made from antelope, sheep, or deer bones. The pendants were made from canine teeth of wapiti. They were perforated by drilling at the root end. Since there were no wapiti bones found in the cave, this suggested that the animals were killed elsewhere. A broken bone tube which had a broad, deep notch near the broken end suggested that the specimen might have been used as a whistle. 2 mountain <b>sheep</b> <b>horns,</b> perforated by a large hole, showed signs of wear on one edge of the hole, indicating the horns were used as shaft wrenches or straighteners.|$|E
5000|$|In Uzbekistan the {{two were}} {{required}} to have a visa for every city that they visited. Belliveau and O'Donnell, however, initially faced difficulty from the Federal Security Service (the successor of the Soviet KGB) in crossing the Friendship Bridge into Afghanistan, but {{were able to do}} so after waiting approximately three weeks, forging their visas and paying a $100 bribe. The two noticed the stark difference between this former Republic of the Soviet Union and Afghanistan—the lack of roads, goods and electricity. To get across Afghanistan, Belliveau and O'Donnell were inspired by a plan implemented by Marco Polo: Kublai Khan had provided Polo and his companions with a golden tablet or paiza on which was written that they should be given all the [...] "lodging they might need and horses to escort them from one land to another." [...] The American adventurers similarly received a letter from a comrade of an Afghan warlord that enabled them to obtain twenty-five heavily armed bodyguards. While traveling to Balkh, the group was ambushed and held captive by ethnic Hazaras, the direct descendants of a tribe that attacked Polo’s caravan. Denis and Francis then {{made their way to the}} Wakhan Corridor in far northeastern Afghanistan. The narrow corridor has been described by the two modern explorers as being the jewel in the crown of their achievement. The leader of the Wakhi people, a living remnant of the days of feudal lords, Shah Sayid Muhammad Ishmael, told the travelers that they were the first Westerners to traverse the legendary corridor in a generation. Belliveau and O'Donnell then crossed the Pamirs into Tajikistan on horseback, passing structures made of <b>sheep</b> <b>horns</b> (ovis poli), that guided the sojourners along the snowy trails just as described by Marco Polo and dictated by local custom.|$|E

5000|$|Goats are {{mentioned}} {{many times in}} the Bible. A goat is considered a [...] "clean" [...] animal by Jewish dietary laws and was slaughtered for an honored guest. It was also acceptable for some kinds of sacrifices. Goat-hair curtains were used in the tent that contained the tabernacle (Exodus 25:4). Its horns can be used instead of <b>sheep's</b> <b>horn</b> to make a shofar. On Yom Kippur, the festival of the Day of Atonement, two goats were chosen and lots were drawn for them. One was sacrificed and the other allowed to escape into the wilderness, symbolically carrying with it the sins of the community. From this comes the word [...] "scapegoat". A leader or king was sometimes compared to a male goat leading the flock. In the New Testament, Jesus told a parable of the Sheep and the Goats (Gospel of Matthew 25).|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Intricately manufactured, {{visually}} stunning, and coveted across vast geographic distances for generations, Columbia River-style mountain <b>sheep</b> <b>horn</b> {{bowls and}} ladles exemplify the quintessential art {{form of the}} Chinookan peoples of the lower Columbia. While these objects are prized as heirlooms and sought as iconic additions to Native art collections, this thesis provides first systematic art historical study dedicated solely to these highly valued sculptural vessels. Based on research in twelve museum collections, this paper analyzes a sample of ninety-eight objects acquired by these institutions between 1850 and 1921 CE and their ethno-historical context, stylistic details, and functional evolutions. Ultimately, this thesis proves the origin of these vessels in a Wasco/Wishram village near the Dalles, their importance in understanding the Chinookan art style, and their sustained cultural value over time in both Indigenous and Euro-American spheres of exchange...|$|R

60|$|In all {{the wild}} species of goats and <b>sheep</b> the <b>horns</b> are larger {{in the male}} than in the female, and are {{sometimes}} quite absent in the latter. (13. Gray, 'Catalogue of Mammalia, the British Museum,' part iii. 1852, p. 160.) In several domestic breeds of these two animals, the males alone are furnished with horns; and in some breeds, for instance, in the sheep of North Wales, though both sexes are properly horned, the ewes are very liable to be hornless. I have been informed by a trustworthy witness, who purposely inspected a flock of these same sheep during the lambing season, that the horns at birth are generally more fully developed in the male than in the female. Mr. J. Peel crossed his Lonk sheep, both sexes of which always bear horns, with hornless Leicesters and hornless Shropshire Downs; {{and the result was}} that the male offspring had their horns considerably reduced, whilst the females were wholly destitute of them. These several facts indicate that, with <b>sheep,</b> the <b>horns</b> are a much less firmly fixed character in the females than in the males; and this leads us to look at the horns as properly of masculine origin.|$|R
