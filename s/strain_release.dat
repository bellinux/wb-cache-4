50|$|The Woodward-Hoffmann rules, {{devised by}} Robert Burns Woodward and Roald Hoffmann, are {{a set of}} rules in organic {{chemistry}} predicting the barrier heights of pericyclic reactions based upon conservation of orbital symmetry. The Woodward-Hoffmann rules can be applied to understand electrocyclic reactions, cycloadditions (including cheletropic reactions), sigmatropic reactions, and group transfer reactions. Reactions are classified as forbidden if there is an additional symmetry imposed energetic barrier arising from correlation of the ground state electronic configuration of the starting material with an excited state in the product. A reaction is classified as allowed if no such additional barrier exists. Thus, these terms do not imply whether a reaction in question will actually take place. Rather, with all other energetic factors being equal, an additional electronic factor exists to impede the symmetry forbidden reaction. Symmetry forbidden reactions can still take place via a pericyclic pathway if other factors (e.g. <b>strain</b> <b>release)</b> favor the reaction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{group has}} tackled {{the problem of}} {{earthquake}} and rupture prediction since the mid-90s within the broader physical concept of critical phenomena.Considering rupture as a second-order phase transition, this predicts that, approaching rupture, the spatial correlation length of stress and damage increases [...] This in turn leads to a power-law acceleration of moment and <b>strain</b> <b>release,</b> up to the macroscopic failure time of the sample (i.e. a large earthquake in nature). This prediction has been checked on various natural and industrial/laboratory data, over {{a wide spectrum of}} different scales (laboratory samples, mines, California earthquakes catalog), and under different loading conditions of the system (constant stress rate, constant strain rate). The most puzzling observation is that the critical power-law rate acceleration is decorated by log-periodic oscillations, suggesting a universal ratio close to 2.2. The existence of such oscillations stems from interactions between seismogenic structures (see below for the case of faults and fractures), but also offers a better constraint to identify areas within which a large event may occur.

Measurement results indicated for the electro-deposited nc Cu, grain growth occurs at about 70 °C, which was prior to the major <b>strain</b> <b>release</b> process (onset at 150 °C).

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that most shallow earthquakes {{are caused by}} a sudden release of tectonic stress, and therefore strain, {{in the form of}} faulting (56, Chap. 14). The elastic rebound theory explains remarkably well the overall nature of major earthquakes. However, it is now evident that the <b>strain</b> <b>release</b> by actual earthquakes takes place in a variety of ways. For example, some earthquakes arc reported to have been preceded by significant premonitory crustal deformations with or without foreshocks. Most major earthquakes are followed by aftershocks and, in some cases, by creep-like postseismic deformations. This variety obviously results from the difference {{in the nature of the}} crust and the stress field in the respective epicentral area. Thus, detailed study on the mode of the <b>strain</b> <b>release</b> for individual earthquakes is important for understanding the physics of earthquakes and for predicting the mode of occurrence of future major earthquakes. The latter problem is of course very important for designing a practical method of earthquake prediction. The crustal deformation represents the low frequency spectrum of the <b>strain</b> <b>release,</b> and seismic waves represent the high frequency spectrum. To understand better the mode of the <b>strain</b> <b>release,</b> it is important to study it over a wide frequency range, from geodetic to seismic. From this point of view, this paper discusses the mode of <b>strain</b> <b>release</b> in several major earthquakes in Japan for which both geodetic and seismic data are available, and we will focus our attention on the relation between the geodetic slip and the seismic slip. Figure 1 shows the locations of the earthquakes discussed in this paper.

40|$|Active {{normal fault}} scarps that offset 12 - 18 ka landforms in the Apennines, Italy, have been mapped into Google Earth to provide precise {{locations}} for structures responsible for tectonic <b>strain</b> <b>release</b> and earthquake rupture. Climate {{change at the}} end of the last glacial maximum (12 - 18 ka) reduced erosion and sedimentation rates below a critical threshold allowing preservation of displacements produced by surface ruptures to palaeoearthquakes. The resultant fault scarps, which record the surface displacements from multiple earthquakes, allow determination of the spatial variation in the rates of fault slip, a parameter critical to assessment of how long-term <b>strain</b> <b>release</b> recorded in the geomorphology (104 years) relates to short-term <b>strain</b> <b>release</b> recorded by earthquake catalogues and geodesy (102 - 3 years). Spatial variation in fault slip occurs at a scale of tens of kilometres, whilst fault scarps have offsets of < 20 - 40 metres and a geomorphic expression that can only be visualised on topographic images with spatial resolution approaching the metre-scale. Thus, until now, debate has surrounded the exact positions of scarps at least in part due to problems of visualising both the detailed geomorphic features and their regional variation.

40|$|In the {{application}} of the theory of damage mechanics to solve a wide range of practical engineering problems, a generalized formulation of damage <b>strain</b> energy <b>release</b> rate Y is required.

40|$|What {{parameters}} {{control the}} evolution of seismicity in a distributed fault system? Results from statistical models of regional seismicity suggest that the scaling of strain energy release in the crust with earthquake magnitude {{may be an important}} factor. Models where <b>strain</b> <b>release</b> scales according to Benioff strain (strain energy ∝ 0. 75 M) show effectively linear strain re-lease through time and no evolution in event statistics, similar to cellular automaton (CA) models with self-organized critical (SOC) behavior. Con-versely, when <b>strain</b> <b>release</b> is scaled according to seismic moment (strain energy ∝ 1. 5 M) the rate of <b>strain</b> <b>release</b> accelerates up to the time of occurrence of large magnitude events and drops thereafter, similar to CA models that show intermittant critical behavior. This raises the question of how strain energy release scales with magnitude in both models and the real earth. Preliminary results of internal strain energy changes associated with earthquakes on a strike-slip fault imbedded in an elastic halfspace sug-gest that strain energy release ∝ 2. 2 M; i. e., that the largest earthquakes do most of the work in removing stored elastic energy from the crust.
