5|$|According to the Chronicle of Parthénope, the Neapolitan princes whom Louis had imprisoned {{during his}} first {{campaign}} in <b>Southern</b> <b>Italy</b> proposed him to marry Queen Joanna I's younger sister and heir, Mary. She was the widow of Charles of Durazzo, who had been executed on Louis's orders. During the siege of Aversa {{in the summer of}} 1350, Louis met her envoy in the nearby Trentola-Ducenta and the terms of their marriage were accepted. However, Mary was forced to marry Robet of Baux after Louis left <b>Southern</b> <b>Italy.</b>|$|E
5|$|By contrast, the Byzantine {{position}} in <b>Southern</b> <b>Italy</b> was gradually consolidated {{so that by}} 873 Bari was once again under Byzantine rule, and most of <b>Southern</b> <b>Italy</b> would remain in the Empire for the next 200 years. On the more important eastern front, the Empire rebuilt its defences and went on the offensive. The Paulicians were defeated and their capital of Tephrike (Divrigi) taken, while the offensive against the Abbasid Caliphate began with the recapture of Samosata.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of {{northern}} Europe. In the late-12th century, the Normans invaded <b>southern</b> <b>Italy</b> and Sicily; although they had the technology to build more modern designs, in many cases wooden motte-and-bailey castles were built instead for reasons of speed. The Italians came {{to refer to a}} range of different castle types as motta, however, and there may not have been as many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in <b>southern</b> <b>Italy</b> as was once thought {{on the basis of the}} documentary evidence alone. In addition, there is evidence of the Norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in Egypt in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade.|$|E

5|$|Commercial {{interaction}} was also intense with the Italian peninsula {{and the western}} Mediterranean.

5|$|In 280 BC, Pyrrhus {{embarked}} on a campaign in Magna Graecia (i.e. <b>southern</b> <b>Italy)</b> against the Roman Republic known as the Pyrrhic War, followed by his invasion of Sicily. Ptolemy Keraunos secured {{his position on the}} Macedonian throne by giving Pyrrhus five thousand soldiers and twenty war elephants for this endeavor. Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275BC after the ultimate failure of both campaigns, which contributed to the rise of Rome because Greek cities in <b>southern</b> <b>Italy</b> such as Tarentum now became Roman allies. Pyrrhus invaded Macedonia in 274BC, defeating the largely mercenary army of AntigonusII at the 274BC Battle of Aous and driving him out of Macedonia, forcing him to seek refuge with his naval fleet in the Aegean.|$|E

5|$|The double {{election}} {{was a result}} of the growing tensions inside the College of Cardinals concerning the policy of the Holy See towards the Holy Roman Empire, initiated by the Concordat of Worms (1122), which ended the investiture controversy. Several, particularly older, cardinals considered the compromise achieved in Worms as desertion of the principles of the Gregorian Reform, and inclined to accept it only as a tactical move. They supported the traditional alliance of the Papacy with the Normans in <b>southern</b> <b>Italy.</b> Some of them were connected to old monastic centers in <b>Southern</b> <b>Italy</b> such as Montecassino. One of their leaders was Cardinal Pierleoni, representative {{of one of the most}} powerful families of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the results}} of the Greek and Islamic {{influence}} on this period in European history was the replacement of Roman numerals with the decimal positional number system and the invention of algebra, which allowed more advanced mathematics. Astronomy advanced following the translation of Ptolemy's Almagest from Greek into Latin in the late 12th century. Medicine was also studied, especially in <b>southern</b> <b>Italy,</b> where Islamic medicine influenced the school at Salerno.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 280 BC, Pyrrhus {{embarked}} on a campaign in Magna Graecia (i.e. <b>southern</b> <b>Italy)</b> against the Roman Republic known as the Pyrrhic War, followed by his invasion of Sicily. Ptolemy Keraunos had secured {{his position on the}} Macedonian throne by gifting Pyrrhus five-thousand soldiers and twenty war elephants for this endeavor. Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275 BC after the stalemate and ultimate failure of both campaigns, which contributed to the rise of Rome now that Greek cities in <b>southern</b> <b>Italy</b> such as Tarentum became Roman allies. Despite having a depleted treasury, Pyrrhus decided to invade Macedonia in 274 BC, due to the perceived political instability of Antigonus II's regime. After defeating the largely mercenary army of Antigonus II at the 274 BC Battle of Aous, Pyrrhus was able to drive him out of Macedonia and force him to take refuge with his naval fleet.|$|E

The battle was fought outside the city of Dyrrhachium (also known as Durazzo), the Byzantine capital of Illyria, and ended in a Norman victory.|$|E
5|$|The city of Bari, {{which had}} been {{the capital of the}} Byzantine Catapanate of <b>Southern</b> <b>Italy</b> for centuries before the arrival of the Normans, opened its gates to the Emperor's army, and the overjoyed {{citizens}} tore down the Norman citadel.

25|$|Because {{the ancient}} Greeks saw wine as {{a staple of}} {{domestic}} life and a viable economic trade commodity, their settlements were encouraged to plant vineyards for local use and trade with the Greek city-states. <b>Southern</b> <b>Italy's</b> abundance of indigenous vines provided an ideal opportunity for wine production, giving rise to the Greek name for the region: Oenotria ("land of vines").|$|R

5|$|Alice's sister, Melisende, Fulk's wife, persuaded Fulk {{to allow}} Alice {{to return to}} Antioch in 1135.

To prevent the Byzantine marriage, Fulk sent his envoy France to Raymond of Poitiers to urge him to come to Antioch, which he did, traveling in disguise, because RogerII of Sicily wanted to capture him in <b>southern</b> <b>Italy.</b>|$|E
5|$|All royal {{charters}} issued {{during the}} first six months of Mary's reign emphasized that she had lawfully inherited her father's crown. However, most Hungarian noblemen were strongly opposed to the very idea of a female monarch. They regarded Charles III of Naples as Louis the Great's legitimate heir because Charles was the last male offspring of the Capetian House of Anjou. Charles could not openly lay claim to Hungary, because his rival for the Kingdom of Naples, Louis I, Duke of Anjouwho was Charles VI of France's unclehad invaded <b>Southern</b> <b>Italy</b> in the previous year.|$|E
