2500|$|Dories {{appeared}} in New England fishing towns sometime after the early 18th century. They were small, shallow-draft boats, usually about {{five to seven}} metres (15 to 22feet) long. Lightweight and versatile, with high sides, a flat bottom and <b>sharp</b> <b>bows,</b> they were easy and cheap to build. The Banks dories {{appeared in}} the 1830s. They were designed to be carried on mother ships and used for fishing cod at the Grand Banks. [...] Adapted almost directly from the low freeboard, French river bateaus, with their straight sides and removable thwarts, bank dories could be nested inside each other and stored on the decks of fishing schooners, such as the Gazela Primeiro, for their trip to the Grand Banks fishing grounds.|$|E

6000|$|The {{result was}} most effective. The gun-boat went at the prow like a war-horse; her <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> struck {{one of the}} pirate vessels fair {{amidships}} and cut her in two pieces, launching her crew and captives into the sea! ...|$|R
6000|$|This was a crusher, as Jack would say. It silenced further {{criticism}} from the disaffected member. We coasted past the <b>sharp</b> <b>bows</b> of a navy of great steamships and stopped at last at a government building on a stone pier. It was easy to remember then that the douain was the customhouse and not the hotel. We did not mention it, however. With winning French politeness the officers merely opened and closed our satchels, declined to examine our passports, and sent us on our way. We stopped at the first cafe we came to and entered. An old woman seated us at a table and waited for orders. The doctor said: ...|$|E
60|$|For {{eight hours}} the Osprey {{struggled}} with the storm. The sea swept over her decks, and the dinghy was smashed into fragments, but the yacht rode with far greater ease than an ordinary vessel would have done, as, save for her bare mast, the wind had no hold upon her. There were no spars with weight of furled sails to catch the wind and hold her down; she was in perfect trim, and her <b>sharp</b> <b>bows</b> met the waves like a wedge, and suffered them to glide past her with scarce a shock, while the added buoyancy gained by reefing the bowsprit and getting the anchors below lifted her over seas that, as they approached, seemed as if they would make a clean sweep over her.|$|E
60|$|Already the head-sails and the main-sail {{had been}} raised, while a hundred willing hands poled her {{off from the}} wharf. Now the wind caught her; heeling over, and quivering with eagerness like an {{unleashed}} hound she flew through the opening {{and out into the}} Channel. She was a famous little schooner, the Marie Rose of Winchelsea, and under her daring owner Cock Badding, half trader and half pirate, had brought back into port many a rich cargo taken in mid-Channel, and paid for in blood rather than money. Small as she was, her great speed and the fierce character of her master had made her a name of terror along the French coast, and many a bulky Eastlander or Fleming as he passed the narrow seas had scanned the distant Kentish shore, fearing lest that ill-omened purple sail with a gold Christopher upon it should shoot out suddenly from the dim gray cliffs. Now she was clear of the land, with the wind on her larboard quarter, every inch of canvas set, and her high <b>sharp</b> <b>bows</b> smothered in foam, as she dug through the waves.|$|E

50|$|A <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> on a {{conventional}} hull form would produce waves and low drag like a bulbous bow, but waves {{coming from the}} side would strike it harder. The blunt bulbous bow also produces higher pressure in a large region in front, making the bow wave start earlier.|$|R
6000|$|Falk was a Dane {{or perhaps}} a Norwegian, I can't tell now. At all events he was a Scandinavian of some sort, and a bloated {{monopolist}} to boot. It is possible he was unacquainted with the word, {{but he had a}} clear perception of the thing itself. His tariff of charges for towing ships in and out was the most brutally inconsiderate document of the sort I had ever seen. He was the commander and owner of the only tug-boat on the river, a very trim white craft of 150 tons or more, as elegantly neat as a yacht, with a round wheel-house rising like a glazed turret high above her <b>sharp</b> <b>bows,</b> and with one slender varnished pole mast forward. I daresay there are yet a few shipmasters afloat who remember Falk and his tug very well. He extracted his pound and a half of flesh from each of us merchant-skippers with an inflexible sort of indifference which made him detested and even feared. Schomberg used to remark: [...] "I won't talk about the fellow. I don't think he has six drinks from year's end to year's end in my place. But my advice is, gentlemen, don't you {{have anything to do with}} him, if you can help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{me there}} was double dulness in the scenery: {{it seemed to be}} Sind over again-the same morning mist and noon-tide glare; the same hot wind and heat clouds, and fiery sunset, and evening glow; the same pillars of dust and [...] "devils" [...] of sand {{sweeping}} like giants over the plain; the same turbid waters of a broad, shallow stream studded with sand-banks and silt-isles, with crashing earth slips and ruins nodding over a kind of cliff, whose base the stream gnaws with noisy tooth. On the banks, saline ground sparkled and glittered like hoar-frost in the sun; and here and there mud villages, solitary huts, pigeon-towers, or watch turrets, whence litt1e brown boys shouted and slung stones at the birds, peeped out from among bright green patches of palm-tree, tamarisk, and mimosa, of maize, tobacco, and sugar-cane. Beyond the narrow tongue of land on the river banks lay the glaring, yellow Desert, with its low hills and sand slopes, bounded by innumerable pyramids of Nature's architecture. The boats, with their <b>sharp</b> <b>bows,</b> preposterous sterns, and lateen sails, might have belonged to the Indus. So might the chocolate-skinned, blue-robed peasantry; the women carrying progeny on their hips, with the eternal waterpot on their heads; and the men sleeping in the shade or following the plough, to which probably Osiris first put hand. The lower animals, like the higher, were the same; gaunt, mange-stained camels, muddy buffaloes, scurvied donkeys, sneaking jackals, and fox-like dogs. Even the feathered creatures were perfectly familiar to my eye- ...|$|E

25|$|During its {{construction}} the Ro III {{was known as}} the Ro II series III, indicating its close similarity to its predecessor. The most obvious difference was a <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> to improve seaworthiness. It was advertised in two forms, either as a ten passenger airliner or a long range reconnaissance aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Blue Jacket had a <b>sharp</b> <b>bow,</b> {{and a full}} {{midship section}} {{designed}} for stowing a large cargo. Lubbock describes this fuller style of hull, which created an appearance of [...] "strength and power" [...] rather than [...] "grace and beauty," [...] as being characteristic of ships designed by Donald McKay.|$|R
50|$|Hull shapes on sportboat's are {{typically}} {{designed so that}} the hulls plane at high speeds. These hull designs are characterized by fairly <b>sharp</b> <b>bows</b> {{to allow them to}} penetrate waves with reduced drag and a flatter underbody aft of the bow. The flat underbody develops lift as speeds increase and the hull rises higher in the water, which reduces the wetted area and decreases drag, allowing higher speeds to be achieved.|$|E

60|$|The Venetian gondola is as {{free and}} graceful, in its gliding movement, as a serpent. It is {{twenty or thirty}} feet long, and is narrow and deep, like a canoe; its <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> and stern sweep upward from the water like the horns of a {{crescent}} with the abruptness of the curve slightly modified.|$|R
60|$|The cutter, {{with her}} <b>sharper</b> <b>bows</b> {{and all her}} sail forward, was feeling it still more severely, and the spirits of all on board the lugger rose rapidly, as {{it was evident that}} they were {{dropping}} their pursuers.

50|$|One story {{often told}} from her service years was when, in February 1961, Nantucket island was iced in and no ferries {{were able to}} make the trip. The Nobska, with its <b>sharp</b> <b>bow,</b> was sent to break through the ice and did so, {{although}} she was then iced in over the weekend. Other stories {{can be found at the}} NESF site.|$|R
60|$|As I sat cogitating, {{my brother}} scribblers {{called me to}} join them in a short {{promenade}} upon the wharf, preparatory to resuming our pens.

5000|$|Whaleboats {{are among}} the classic [...] "pulling" [...] (rowing) boats, with a <b>sharp</b> <b>bow,</b> fine stern lines and a canoe stern. Despite being {{somewhat}} more tippy, with less cargo capacity than prams, they row, motor and sail well because of their fine lines.

50|$|He {{was born}} in Inverbervie, the Mearns, Scotland. On his nineteenth {{birthday}} in 1855 Hercules Linton was apprenticed to Alexander Hall and Sons who at the time, were the leading shipbuilders in Aberdeen and whose schooner Scottish Maid (1839) with its <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> and entry helped coin the term Aberdeen Bow. Linton progressed through his apprenticeship and eventually rose to a senior position at Alexander Hall and Sons.|$|R
5000|$|A caïque (καΐκι, kaiki, from kayık [...] ) is {{the term}} for a {{traditional}} fishing boat usually found among {{the waters of the}} Ionian or Aegean Sea, and also a light skiff used on the Bosporus. It is traditionally a small wooden trading vessel, brightly painted and rigged for sail. The caïque is also a typical case of positioning the widest beam far aft, with a long <b>sharp</b> <b>bow.</b>|$|R
60|$|Dick was {{permitted}} to go no further. While Bill Goss was speaking the Spray had been caught by a sudden puff of wind and sent over to starboard. Now the Falcon came on swiftly, and in an instant her <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> crashed into the Rover boy's boat. The shock of the collision caused the Spray to shiver from stem to stern, and then, with a jagged hole in her side, she began to slowly sink.|$|R
60|$|Then the carrying-steamer {{turned her}} <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> to the sou'-west, put on full steam, {{and made for}} the Thames--distant nearly 300 miles--with over 2000 trunks of fresh fish on board, for the breakfast, luncheon and dinner tables of the Great City. Thus, if the steamer were to leave early on a Monday, it would arrive on Tuesday night and the fish be sold in the market on Wednesday morning about five o'clock.|$|R
60|$|Lane glanced quickly about him. Several {{boats were}} pulled {{up on the}} shore, one of which evidently had been used by a boatman {{collecting}} driftwood that morning, for it contained oars and a long pike-pole. The boat was long, wide of beam, and flat of bottom, with a <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> and a blunt stern, a craft such as experienced rivermen used for heavy work. Without a moment's hesitation Lane shoved it {{into the water and}} sprang aboard.|$|R
50|$|The word 'snow' {{comes from}} 'snauw' {{which is an}} old Dutch word for beak; a {{reference}} to the characteristic <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> of the vessel. The snow evolved from the (three-masted) ship: the mizzen mast of a ship was gradually moved closer towards the mainmast, until the mizzen mast was no longer a separate mast, but was instead made fast at the main mast top. As such, in the 17th century the snow used to be sometimes classified as a three-masted vessel.|$|R
50|$|HSwMS Garmer, {{named after}} the dog Garmr from Norse mythology, {{was the first of}} these monitors. She was {{designed}} by the inventor John Ericssonand Lieutenant John Christian d'Ailly. Garmer was intended to support Karlsborg Fortress on Lake Vättern. A report to the Parliament of Sweden described her as lacking a keel, flat-bottomed amidships and had a <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> and stern. The ship measured 28.5 m long overall and had a beam of 6.98 m. She had a draft of 2.29 m and displaced 271 t. Her crew numbered 20 officers and men.|$|R
50|$|The main {{differences}} from American scows were <b>sharper</b> <b>bows</b> and favouring the ketch rig {{instead of the}} schooner rig, although a great many schooner and topsail schooner rigged vessels were built.Some 130 scows {{were built in the}} north of New Zealand between 1873 and 1925, they ranged from 45 to 130 ft (14 - 40 m). New Zealand trading scows travelled all around New Zealand as well as to Australia and to the west coast of America although the majority were based in the Hauraki Gulf of New Zealand.|$|R
