When he faced Badrang head-to-head, he was beaten to death by his minions. It wasn't until Martin arrived with his army that he forced Badrang into a corner. Martin's army burned down Marshank's gate, and began their attack. In the confusion, Martin retrieved his father's sword and slew Badrang with it. Unfortunately, Badrang had stabbed and killed Rose during the battle. The Fur and Freedom Fighters returned to Noonvale, where it will remain a secret, while Martin continued on his own path.|$|E

By {{the beginning of}} the 18th century, the Danish West India and Guinea Company had consolidated their <b>slave</b> <b>operation</b> to the vicinity of Accra (now in Ghana) on the Guinea coast. The Akwamu had conquered the Accra and established dominance on trading routes into the interior. They became the dominant tribe of Akan people in the district of Accra and were known for being [...] "heavy-handed in dealing with the tribes they had conquered," [...] taking captives and selling them as slaves, and keeping numerous women as concubines in various villages. After the Akwamu king died, rival tribes in the area attacked the weakened Akwamu nation, and by 1730 they defeated the people. In retaliation for years of oppression, their enemies sold many Akwamu people into slavery to the Danes; they were transported to plantations in the West Indies, including estates on St. John.|$|E

25|$|As {{governor}} Guzmán {{instituted a}} system of Indian slave trade in Pánuco. During a raid along Río de Las Palmas in 1528 he allowed every horseman to take 20 Indian slaves and each footman 15. In 1529 he gave out individual slaving permissions amounting to more than 1000 slaves. Initially Guzmán did not allow Spaniards to sell slaves for export except in exchange for livestock, but later he gave more than 1500 slave licenses (each permitting the taking of between 15 and 50 slaves) in an eight-month period. The <b>slaving</b> <b>operation</b> in Pánuco expanded when Guzmán became President of the Royal Audiencia of Mexico and he had Indian slaves smuggled into Pánuco and shipped on to the Caribbean. Indian slaves were branded on the face. Taking Indian slaves was not explicitly outlawed in the period before 1528. Beginning in 1528, Indian <b>slaving</b> <b>operations</b> came under increased royal control but were not prohibited. The regulations of September 19, 1528, required slave owners to present proof of {{the legality of the}} taking of any slaves before branding. In 1529 the Crown began an investigation into the slaving enterprises of Guzmán.|$|R

50|$|Smallpox in Angola {{was likely}} {{introduced}} shortly after Portuguese {{settlement of the}} area in 1484. The 1864 epidemic killed 25,000 inhabitants, {{one third of the}} total population in that same area. In 1713, an outbreak occurred in South Africa after a ship from India docked at Cape Town, bringing infected laundry ashore. Many of the white population suffered, and whole clans of the Hottentot tribe were wiped out. A second outbreak occurred in 1755, again affecting both the white population and the Hottentots. The Hottentots spread the disease further among their tribes, and completely eradicating several tribes, {{all the way to the}} Kalahari desert. A third outbreak in 1767 similarly affected the Hottentots and Bantu tribes, but the whites settlers, having practiced variolation, were not affected nearly to the extent that they were in the first two outbreaks. Continued <b>slaving</b> <b>operations</b> brought smallpox to Cape Town again in 1840, taking the lives of 2500 people, and then to Uganda in the 1840s. It is estimated that up to eighty percent of the Griqua tribe was exterminated by smallpox in 1831, and whole tribes were being wiped out in Kenya up until 1899. Along the Zaire river basin were areas where no one survived the epidemics, leaving the land devoid of human life. In Ethiopia and the Sudan, six epidemics are recorded for the 19th century: 1811-1813, 1838-1839, 1865-1866, 1878-1879, 1885-1887, and 1889-1890.|$|R

5000|$|According {{to local}} tradition, {{the founders of}} the Sakalava kingdom were Maroseraña (or Maroseranana, [...] "those who owned many ports") princes, from the Fiherenana (now Toliara). They may also be descended from the Zafiraminia (sons of Ramini) clans from the southwestern part of the island, {{possibly}} from Arab origin. The demand for slaves by first Omani Arabs who controlled the Zanzibar slave trade, and later European slave-traders, led to <b>slave</b> raiding <b>operations</b> and exercise of control on the major ports on the north and northwest region of Madagascar. Initially the Arabs exclusively supplied weapons to the Sakalava in exchange for slaves. These slaves were obtained from slave raids to Comoros and other coastal settlements of Madagascar, as well as from merchant ships arriving from the Swahili coast of Africa. The Sakalava kingdom quickly subjugated the neighbouring territories in the Mahafaly area, starting with the southern ones.|$|R

Larger operations of Prazos da Zambezia included operating ships and slave voyages, and many ports and ships from Mozambique catered to this trade. These operations were run by both genders, the Portuguese men and women. Official documents of the Governor-general Joaquim Pereira Marinho from 1840-1841 period state everyone was involved in this <b>slave</b> trading <b>operations,</b> from Portuguese to Moors, women of all ages, clergymen, civilians and soldiers in the Portuguese colony; it also describes how mujojos, or [...] "dark Moors" [...] would invade to steal slaves and export them from different ports and the Island of Mozambique.|$|R

40|$|In {{animations}} it {{is sometimes}} convenient to consider a collection of objects as a group which can be manipulated as a unit. You can {{think of this as}} a method of making JOTSA objects which are more complicated than the basic object types. 2 How it works In JOTSA when an object, called the slave, is linked to another object, called the master, certain operations applied to the master affect the <b>slave.</b> These include <b>operations</b> involving position and size. When the master is moved, the slave follows. When the master has its size changed with scaling factors, the slave is also scaled. JOTSA supports separate scaling factors in both the x- and y-directions. When a slave is linked to a master, the slave’s position is specified relative to the master, rather than in absolute terms. When the master is scaled, the relative position of each of its slaves is also scaled. Since the position of most JOTSA objects corresponds {{to the center of the}} object, scaling an object affects objects linked to it in a natural way. 3 Some examples Figure 1 shows two views of stacked rectangles. The blue rectangle is on top of the red one...|$|R
50|$|Cutting {{wood was}} {{seasonal}} work that required workers to spend several months isolated in temporary makeshift {{camps in the}} forest, away from families in Belize Town. Settlers needed {{only one or two}} slaves to cut logwood, a small tree that grows in clumps near the coast. But as the trade shifted to mahogany {{in the last quarter of}} the 18th century, the settlers needed more money, land, and <b>slaves</b> for larger-scale <b>operations.</b> After 1770 about 80 percent of all male slaves aged ten years or more cut timber. Huntsmen found the trees, which were then cut, trimmed, and hauled to the riverside. During the rainy season, settlers and slaves floated rafts of untrimmed logs downriver, where the wood was processed for shipment. Huntsmen were highly skilled and valued slaves, as were the axmen who cut the trees while standing on a springy platform four to five meters high. Another group of slaves cared for the oxen that pulled the huge logs to the river. Others trimmed the trees and cleared the tracks. The use of small gangs of slaves for cutting wood reduced the need for close supervision; whip-wielding drivers, who were ubiquitous on large plantations elsewhere, were unknown in the settlement.|$|R
