25|$|PNG {{offers a}} variety of {{transparency}} options. With true-color and grayscale images either a <b>single</b> <b>pixel</b> value can be declared as transparent or an alpha channel can be added (enabling any percentage of partial transparency to be used). For paletted images, alpha values can be added to palette entries. The number of such values stored may be less than the total number of palette entries, in which case the remaining entries are considered fully opaque.|$|E
2500|$|... tRNS {{contains}} transparency information. For indexed images, it stores {{alpha channel}} values {{for one or}} more palette entries. For truecolor and grayscale images, it stores a <b>single</b> <b>pixel</b> value {{that is to be}} regarded as fully transparent.|$|E
2500|$|Pixels in PNG {{images are}} numbers {{that may be}} either indices of sample data in the palette or the sample data itself. [...] The palette is a {{separate}} table contained in the PLTE chunk. [...] Sample data for a <b>single</b> <b>pixel</b> consists of a tuple of between one and four numbers. [...] Whether the pixel data represents palette indices or explicit sample values, the numbers {{are referred to as}} channels and every number in the image is encoded with an identical format.|$|E

2500|$|The DE-9 {{connectors}} {{were designed}} to be electrically compatible with the joysticks popular on numerous 8-bit systems, such as the Commodore 64 and the Atari 2600. [...] Although the ports {{could be used for}} both purposes, the signals must be interpreted differently. [...] As a result, plugging a mouse into a joystick port causes the [...] "joystick" [...] to continuously move in some direction, even if the mouse stays still, whereas plugging a joystick into a mouse port causes the [...] "mouse" [...] to only be able to move a <b>single</b> <b>pixel</b> in each direction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{driving force}} behind {{programmable}} matter is the actual hardware that is manipulating itself into whatever form is desired. [...] Claytronics consists {{of a collection of}} individual components called claytronic atoms, or catoms. [...] In order to be viable, catoms need to fit a set of criteria. First, catoms {{need to be able to}} move in three dimensions relative to each other and be able to adhere to each other to form a three-dimensional shape. Second, the catoms need to be able to communicate with each other in an ensemble and be able to compute state information, possibly with assistance from each other. [...] Fundamentally, catoms consist of a CPU, a network device for communication, a <b>single</b> <b>pixel</b> display, several sensors, an onboard battery, and a means to adhere to one another.|$|E

40|$|Image {{registration}} {{requires the}} specification {{of a class}} of discriminatory image features and an appropriate imagedissimilarity measure. Entropic spanning graphs produce a consistent estimator of feature entropy and divergence. We compare direct estimators with non-parametric "plugin " density estimators, on <b>single</b> <b>pixels</b> and independent image component feature vectors. We have also investigated a technique for minimum spanning tree construction with significantly lower memory and time complexity. On the basis of misregistration errors with decreasing SNR, the minimal graph entropy estimator can have better performance than indirect estimators. In general, misregistration errors are lower with higher dimensional ICA feature vectors as compared to <b>single</b> <b>pixels...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Geometric {{resolution}} {{refers to}} the satellite sensor's ability to effectively image {{a portion of the}} Earth's surface in a <b>single</b> <b>pixel</b> and is typically expressed in terms of Ground sample distance, or GSD. GSD is a term containing the overall optical and systemic noise sources and is useful for comparing how well one sensor can [...] "see" [...] an object on the ground within a <b>single</b> <b>pixel.</b> For example, the GSD of Landsat is ~30m, which means the smallest unit that maps to a <b>single</b> <b>pixel</b> within an image is ~30m x 30m. The latest commercial satellite (GeoEye 1) has a GSD of 0.41 m. This compares to a 0.3 m resolution obtained by some early military film based Reconnaissance satellite such as Corona.|$|E

40|$|Performing Stokes {{inversion}} on <b>single</b> <b>pixels</b> can {{be difficult}} due to seeing and instrumental smearing. We present two different techniques to improve Stokes inversions. The first method, REGIONS, is a code that finds pixels {{that are likely to}} contain signal from the same magnetic element. The second method, mCLEAN, reconstructs a magnetogram if the point spread function (PSF) of the instrument and seeing is known...|$|R
50|$|In {{the context}} of image processing, binning is the {{procedure}} of combining a cluster of pixels into a <b>single</b> <b>pixel.</b> As such, in 2x2 binning, an array of 4 pixels becomes a single larger pixel, reducing {{the overall number of}} pixels.|$|E
50|$|Gas {{detectors}} {{are usually}} <b>single</b> <b>pixel</b> detectors measuring only the average dose rate over the gas volume {{or the number}} of interacting photons as explained above, but they can be made spatially resolving by having many crossed wires in a wire chamber.|$|E

Prototype <b>single</b> <b>pixels</b> using double-slot dipole antennas and integrated microstrip band defining filters have been built and tested. Preliminary results of optical testing and simulations are presented. A bolometer array design based on this pixel will also be shown and future plans for application of the technology will be discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Display screens: liquid-crystal-laser-based {{displays}} offer most of {{the advantages}} of standard liquid-crystal displays, but the low spectral spread gives more precise control over color. Individual elements are small enough to act as <b>single</b> <b>pixels</b> while retaining high brightness and color definition. A system in which each <b>pixel</b> is a <b>single</b> spatially tuned device could avoid the sometimes long relaxation times of dynamic tuning, and could emit any color using spatial addressing and the same monochromatic pumping source.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we have {{demonstrated}} the application of Bayesian analysis using Markov chains to analyse full-waveform Ladar pixel and image data acquired by a new scanning sensor. The sensor uses time-correlated photon counting technology, and coupled with algorithmic development, {{we are able to}} detect multiple surface returns within the field of view of <b>single</b> <b>pixels,</b> creating multilayer images. This has application in defence and security when objects of interest may be partially concealed, or viewed through semitransparent surfaces, such as through windows.|$|R
50|$|During texture magnification, {{the number}} of texels {{that need to be}} looked up for any pixel is always four or fewer; during minification, however, as the {{textured}} polygon moves farther away potentially the entire texture might fall into a <b>single</b> <b>pixel.</b> This would necessitate reading all of its texels and combining their values to correctly determine the pixel color, a prohibitively expensive operation. Mipmapping avoids this by prefiltering the texture and storing it in smaller sizes down to a <b>single</b> <b>pixel.</b> As the textured surface moves farther away, the texture being applied switches to the prefiltered smaller size. Different sizes of the mipmap are referred to as 'levels', with Level 0 being the largest size (used closest to the viewer), and increasing levels used at increasing distances.|$|E
50|$|Pixel-oriented {{displays}} may drive a <b>single</b> <b>pixel</b> {{at a time}} or {{an entire}} row or column of pixels simultaneously. Active-matrix liquid crystal displays provide a storage element at each pixel so that the pixel continues to display the correct state even when not being actively driven.|$|E
5000|$|Arial Black: Arial Black, Arial Black Italic. This {{weight is}} known for being {{particularly}} heavy. This is because the face was originally drawn as a bitmap, and to increase the weight, stroke widths for bold went from a <b>single</b> <b>pixel</b> width to two pixels in width.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{algorithm}} operates on <b>single</b> <b>pixels</b> {{and has no}} conditional statements, it is very fast and suitable for real-time transformations. Additionally, because {{the location of the}} dithering patterns stays always the same relative to the display frame, it is less prone to jitter than error-diffusion methods, making it suitable for animations. Because the patterns are more repetitive than error-diffusion method, an image with ordered dithering compresses better. Ordered dithering is more suitable for line-art graphics as it will result in straighter lines and fewer anomalies.|$|R
40|$|We employ Bayesian {{inference}} for {{the joint}} estimation of sources and background on ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) data. The probabilistic method allows for detection improvement of faint extended celestial sources compared to the Standard Analysis Software System (SASS). Background maps were estimated in a single step together with the detection of sources without pixel censoring. Consistent uncertainties of background and sources are provided. The source probability is evaluated for <b>single</b> <b>pixels</b> {{as well as for}} pixel domains to enhance source detection of weak and extended sources...|$|R
40|$|The {{beginnings}} of a generic vectorized machine vision library implemented in AltiVec is discussed. The general vector loop for machine vision algorithms requiring only a <b>single</b> input <b>pixel</b> per input image to produce a <b>single</b> output <b>pixel</b> is discussed and analysed. Factors discussed that affect the speedup of the vector program are data alignment (when loading and storing), data streaming instructions (used to prefetch data), and function complexity. In addition, two simple operations are presented — an image doubling function and a threshold functor. ...|$|R
