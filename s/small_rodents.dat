5|$|As a whole, Oryzomyini {{includes}} over {{a hundred}} species in about thirty genera. Oryzomyini {{is one of several}} tribes within the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, which encompasses hundreds of other species of mainly <b>small</b> <b>rodents,</b> distributed chiefly in Eurasia and the Americas.|$|E
5|$|All {{three are}} part of the genus Oecomys, which {{includes}} about fifteen species distributed in rainforest habitats in South America and into southern Central America. Oecomys is one of the genera of the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels is classified in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly <b>small</b> <b>rodents.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most frogs {{identify}} prey by movement, {{and vision}} {{appears to be}} the primary method by which the cane toad detects prey; however, the cane toad can also locate food using its sense of smell. They eat a wide range of material; in addition to the normal prey of <b>small</b> <b>rodents,</b> reptiles, other amphibians, birds, and even bats and a range of invertebrates, they also eat plants, dog food, and household refuse.|$|E

5|$|Salta, and the Moss in particular, {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of plant and animal life, {{including}} some rare specimens. Adders, Britain's only native venomous snake, are seen on the Moss, and prey upon <b>small</b> <b>rodents,</b> such as voles. Many wild bird species inhabit Salta and the surrounding area, including larger species such as pheasants, which are also bred locally for hunting.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{raccoons}} in the Southeast {{have yielded}} infection rates ranging from 47% to {{as low as}} 15.5%. Armadillo prevalence studies have been described in Louisiana, and range {{from a low of}} 1.1% to 28.8%. Additionally, <b>small</b> <b>rodents,</b> including squirrels, mice, and rats, are important in the sylvatic transmission cycle because of their importance as bloodmeal sources for the insect vectors. A Texas study revealed 17.3% percent T. cruzi prevalence in 75 specimens representing four separate small rodent species.|$|E
50|$|The typical striped {{grass mouse}} (Lemniscomys striatus) is a <b>small</b> <b>rodent</b> of the {{suborder}} Myomorpha {{in the family}} Muridae.|$|R
50|$|It is {{strictly}} nocturnal, preying mostly on large insects (such as moths, beetles, scorpions) {{along with the}} occasional <b>small</b> <b>rodent.</b>|$|R
50|$|The young will prey {{on small}} frogs and lizards, while adults will feed on larger prey such as <b>smaller</b> <b>rodents.</b>|$|R
5|$|Thus, {{the species}} {{is now known as}} Euryoryzomys emmonsae. As a species of Euryoryzomys, it is {{classified}} within the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), which includes over a hundred species, mainly from South and Central America. Oryzomyini in turn is part of the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly <b>small</b> <b>rodents.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike other snakes, Naja nigricollis can {{be either}} nocturnal or diurnal {{depending}} {{on the time of}} year, geographic location, and average daytime temperature. This adaptability allows the snake to better regulate its body temperature and {{to gain access to the}} most abundant food sources of a particular area. It feeds primarily on <b>small</b> <b>rodents,</b> such as small rats and mice, birds, and fishes, but will also eat lizards, eggs, and other snakes.|$|E
5|$|Abundant {{evidence}} for the domestication of guinea pigs has been found at Tequendama and Aguazuque where the <b>small</b> <b>rodents</b> formed part of the diet of the people, who consumed mainly white-tailed deer, hunted on the plains surrounding the various lakes and rivers. The diet was greatly expanded when early agriculture was introduced, possibly influenced by migrations from the south; present-day Peru. The main cultivated product was maize in various forms and colours, while tubers formed a significant {{other part of the}} food source. The fertile soils of especially the Bogotá savanna proved advantageous for the development of this agriculture, still evidenced today by the widespread farmfields outside the Colombian capital.|$|E

5|$|According to phylogenetic {{analysis}} of sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, Akodon spegazzinii is most {{closely related to}} A.boliviensis and more distantly to {{other members of the}} A.boliviensis species group, including Akodon polopi and Akodon sylvanus. The boliviensis group is part of the highly diverse genus Akodon and thereby of the tribe Akodontini, which includes about 90 species of South American rodents. Akodontini is one of several tribes within the subfamily Sigmodontinae and the family Cricetidae, which includes hundreds of mainly <b>small</b> <b>rodents</b> distributed chiefly in Eurasia and the Americas.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable {{of killing a}} rabbit five to ten times its own weight. Although they are {{commonly}} taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when <b>small</b> <b>rodents</b> are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take {{a higher proportion of}} rabbits than females, as well as an overall greater variety of prey. This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes {{are usually}} {{together}} in pairs or small groups consisting of families, {{such as a}} mated pair and their young, or a male with several females having kinship ties. The young of the mated pair remain with their parents to assist in caring for new kits. The species primarily feeds on <b>small</b> <b>rodents,</b> though it may also target rabbits, game birds, reptiles, invertebrates and young ungulates. Fruit and vegetable matter is also eaten sometimes. Although the red fox tends to kill smaller predators, including other fox species, it is vulnerable to attack from larger predators, such as wolves, coyotes, golden jackals and medium- and large-sized felines.|$|E
50|$|The little desert pocket mouse (Chaetodipus arenarius) is {{a species}} of <b>small</b> <b>rodent</b> in the family Heteromyidae. It is endemic to Baja California in Mexico.|$|R
50|$|This monitor is a crab specialist; however, it {{has been}} {{observed}} eating snails, insects, molluscs, fish, frogs, and <b>smaller</b> <b>rodents.</b> Little is known overall about this species compared to other monitor lizards.|$|R
50|$|The lesser Egyptian jerboa الجربوع (Jaculus jaculus) is a <b>small</b> <b>rodent</b> of Africa and the Middle East.Its diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} seeds and grasses, however the Jerboa needs very little water to survive.|$|R
5|$|<b>Small</b> <b>rodents</b> {{form the}} largest {{part of the}} least weasel's diet, but it also kills and eats rabbits, other mammals, and {{occasionally}} birds, birds' eggs, fish and frogs. Males mark their territories with olfactory signals and have exclusive home ranges which may intersect with or include several female ranges. Least weasels use pre-existing holes to sleep, store food and raise their young. Breeding {{takes place in the}} spring and summer, and there is a single litter of about six kits which are reared exclusively by the female. Due to its small size and fierce nature, the least weasel plays an important part in the mythology and legend of various cultures.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpecker species {{live up to}} their name and feed on insects and other invertebrates living under bark and in wood, but overall the family is characterized by its dietary flexibility, with many species being both highly omnivorous and opportunistic. The diet includes ants, termites, beetles and their larvae, caterpillars, spiders, other arthropods, bird eggs, nestlings, <b>small</b> <b>rodents,</b> lizards, fruit, nuts and sap. Many insects and their grubs are taken from living and dead trees by excavation. The bird may hear sounds from inside the timber indicating where it will be productive to create a hole.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} takes both {{vegetable}} and animal food, {{and is more}} carnivorous than most <b>small</b> <b>rodents</b> are; dominant food items vary seasonally. Plants eaten include species of Spartina, Salicornia, Tripsacum, and Elymus, among others; it mainly eats seeds and succulent parts. It prefers Spartina alterniflora that has been fertilized with nitrogen and mainly eats the inner tissue of the stem, perhaps because nitrogen-fertilized plants contain much less dimethylsulfoniopropionate in their inner tissues. The marsh rice rat was a major pest on rice plantations, feeding on the rice when it was newly planted. It also eats the fungus Endogone at times.|$|E
50|$|The olive {{grass mouse}} is a <b>small</b> <b>rodent</b> {{with a total}} length of about 17 cm. The upper parts are greyish-brown, {{sometimes}} slightly yellowish around the snout, and the underparts are pale to mid-grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{external}} ears of felids {{are also}} large, and especially sensitive to high-frequency {{sounds in the}} smaller cats. This sensitivity allows them to locate <b>small</b> <b>rodent</b> prey; cats do not apparently produce such sounds.|$|R
60|$|They watched Mugambi {{make his}} little kill of a <b>small</b> <b>rodent,</b> and they {{followed}} {{him as he}} returned to his hut, their owner moving quietly through the trees upon the trail of the Negro.|$|R
5|$|The olive baboon also {{actively}} hunts prey, from <b>small</b> <b>rodents</b> and hares to foxes {{and other}} primates. Its limit is usually small antelope, such as Thomson's gazelle and also, rarely, sheep, goats, and live chickens, which may amount to 33.5% of its food from hunting. Hunting {{is usually a}} group activity, with {{both males and females}} participating. Interestingly, this systematic predation was apparently developed recently. In a field study, such behavior was observed as starting with the males of one troop and spreading through all ages and sexes.|$|E
5|$|Though the bobcat prefers {{rabbits and}} hares, it hunts insects, chickens, geese and other birds, <b>small</b> <b>rodents,</b> and deer. Prey {{selection}} depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring {{and has a}} gestation period of about two months.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys couesi and {{at least}} six more {{narrowly}} distributed species with peripheral distributions together form the O.couesi group within the genus Oryzomys. The eighth species of the genus, the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) is {{the only member of}} its own group (unless western populations are classified as a separate species, O.texensis). Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were reclassified in various studies culminating in contributions by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus. All are placed in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly <b>small</b> <b>rodents.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} {{birch mouse}} (Sicista betulina) is a <b>small</b> <b>rodent</b> about 5 to 8 cm long (without the tail), weighing 5 to 13 g. It lives in northern Europe and Asia in forest and marsh zones.|$|R
50|$|Mammals include eight {{species of}} lemur, {{two of which}} are mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.), the world's {{smallest}} primates. The greater big-footed mouse (Macrotarsomys ingens) is a recently described <b>small</b> <b>rodent</b> known only in the park and its vicinity.|$|R
50|$|Skrjabingylus nasicola is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} nematode in the family Metastrongylidae. Its lifecycle includes an intermediary mollusc host and a paratenic host, a shrew or <b>small</b> <b>rodent.</b> Adult worms {{are found in the}} nasal sinuses of mustelids.|$|R
