50|$|Biological <b>small-angle</b> <b>scattering</b> is a <b>small-angle</b> <b>scattering</b> {{method for}} {{structure}} analysis of biological materials. <b>Small-angle</b> <b>scattering</b> {{is used to}} study {{the structure of a}} variety of objects such as solutions of biological macromolecules, nanocomposites, alloys, and synthetic polymers. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) are the two complementary techniques known jointly as <b>small-angle</b> <b>scattering</b> (SAS). SAS is an analogous method to X-ray and neutron diffraction, wide angle X-ray scattering, as well as to static light scattering. In separation to the other X-ray and neutron scattering methods, SAS yields information on the sizes and shapes of both crystalline and non-crystalline particles. When used to study biological materials, which are very often in aqueous solution, the scattering pattern is orientation averaged.|$|E

If the shape is known, a size distribution may be fitted to the intensity. Typically one assumes the particles to be spherical in the latter case.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe trifluoroethanol (TFE) -induced {{conformational}} {{transition of}} hen lysozyme was studied with the combined use of far-UV circular dichroism (CD) and <b>small-angle</b> X-ray <b>scattering.</b> At pH 2. 0 and 20 °C, {{the addition of}} TFE to the native lysozyme induced a cooperative transition to an intermediate state with an increased helical content (TFE state). <b>Small-angle</b> X-ray <b>scattering</b> measurements indicated that the TFE state has a radius of gyration which is 20 % larger {{than that of the}} native state and assumes a chain-like conformation with some remaining globularity. The TFE-induced transition curves obtained by CD and the <b>small-angle</b> X-ray <b>scattering</b> measurements agreed well, consistent with a two-state transition mechanism.

40|$|AbstractThe {{distribution}} of divalent ions in semidilute solutions of high-molecular-mass DNA containing both sodium chloride and strontium chloride in near-physiological conditions is studied by <b>small-angle</b> x-ray <b>scattering</b> and by <b>small-angle</b> neutron <b>scattering.</b> Both <b>small-angle</b> neutron <b>scattering</b> and <b>small-angle</b> x-ray <b>scattering</b> reveal a continuous {{increase in the}} scattering intensity at low q with increasing divalent ion concentration, while at high q the scattering curves converge. The best fit to the data is found for a configuration in which DNA strands of cross-sectional radius 10 Å are surrounded by a counterion sheath of outer radius ∼ 13. 8 Å, independent of the strontium chloride concentration. When the strontium chloride is replaced by calcium chloride, similar results are obtained, but {{the thickness of the}} sheath increases when the divalent salt concentration decreases. These results correspond in both cases to partial localization of the counterions within a layer that is thinner than the effective Debye screening length...|$|R
