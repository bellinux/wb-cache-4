When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.|$|E

25|$|When the Abarcas left Iguala {{after the}} mass {{kidnapping}} in September 2014, law enforcement began an investigation to locate all the properties {{owned by the}} couple and their families. Abarca had several properties in Guerrero and in other states, but authorities believed that he was hiding in Mexico City or Monterrey, Nuevo León. After ruling out Monterrey as a possible hideout, authorities concentrated on three properties in Iztapalapa where they believed the couple was hiding. Through the couple's real estate businesses, authorities were also able to link Berumen to the family once more and locate her properties in Iztapalapa. In one of the properties, investigators noticed something unusual: they regularly <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> (now known to be Berumen) {{going in and out}} of a property that was thought to be abandoned. Authorities then mounted an investigation and surveillance operation on Berumen before finally entering the property and arresting Abarca and Pineda.|$|E

2500|$|Quicksilver {{loses his}} powers of speed when his sister removes {{most of his}} mutant powers, but gains new powers {{courtesy}} of the Inhumans' Terrigen Mist. The mist gives Quicksilver the ability to displace himself out of mainstream time and space and [...] "jump" [...] into the future. The character can summon several time-displaced duplicates of himself and appear to teleport by [...] "jumping" [...] into the future and then returning to the present at a new location. By voluntarily embedding fragments of the Terrigen Crystals into his own body, the character could empower former mutants with extreme versions of their superhuman abilities. However, the effect was usually fatal. The crystals are subsequently forced from the character's body by the mutant Rictor, leaving him without these abilities.

2500|$|A {{popular and}} long-running {{feature of the}} show is [...] "Flash Friday", in which men are {{encouraged}} to drive with their headlights on and women are encouraged to expose their breasts to such vehicles. The feature began as a one-time bit; while on the air, Leykis recalled a radio host he listened to as a child, who asked his listeners in New York apartments to flash their lights on and off and then to look outside to see how many neighbors were doing the same, as a way to gauge the audience size (Jean Shepherd). Leykis asked his listeners to do the same with their car headlights, and a few minutes later, jokingly suggested that women flash their breasts. A listener called in to report that he <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> flashing fellow drivers, and it became a regular feature of the show. Both women and men commonly call during the Friday broadcast to alert other listeners as to their location, and to recount stories of flashing or being flashed, respectively.|$|E

Although the song was not released commercially, it appeared on several charts, reaching number two on the German Black Charts. The tenth song, [...] "Necessary", written by Cee Lo Green, discusses Brandy's desire for her hard work to matter to loved ones, and features a syncopated, skipping beat. Eleventh track, the soulful and minimalistic [...] "Say You Will" [...] <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> ready to settle down, and urging her mate to join her in a domestic life. [...] "How I Feel", a serene, smoky ballad, featured Norwood warning her mate that his busy life was slowly pushing her away. The song was blend of the adult-oriented urban pop of her former albums, and the more ambient, bluesy work she was dabbling with. [...] "Should I Go", based upon Coldplay's song [...] "Clocks", is built on percussive beats, syncopated handclaps and a piano riff. Lyrically, Norwood as the protagonist openly talks about contemplating stepping away from the music business, admitting that she's {{trying to figure out where}} she fits in today.|$|E
