50|$|If {{a passive}} two-port can be {{expressed}} with admittance parameters, then that two-port is equivalent to a pi pad. In general, the admittance parameters are frequency dependent and not necessarily resistive. In that case {{the elements of the}} pi pad would not be simple components. However, in the case where the two-port is purely resistive or <b>substantially</b> <b>resistive</b> over the frequency range of interest, then the two-port can be replaced with a pi pad made of resistors.|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} differential ac {{technique has}} been used to measure the specific heat of low-T c single-crystal Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6 +delta (T cap 15 K) in fields up to 7 T applied parallel to the c axis. In contrast to high-T c cuprates where a magnetic field <b>substantially</b> broadens the <b>resistive</b> transition, in these low-T c samples, the field simply shifts the transition to lower temperatures leaving its width unchanged. Our specific-heat results, however, show a quite different behavior. The superconducting anomaly is dramatically reduced in size and broadened by the field, suggesting, in analogy with other cuprates,the presence of strong thermal-fluctuation effects...|$|R
40|$|Gallium nitride based {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) are presently fundamentally transforming the lighting industry, but limitations in {{the materials and}} fabrication methods of LEDs introduce substantial challenges to their future development. Among the remaining key bottlenecks of GaN LEDs are the resistive losses and current crowding that strongly increase the heat generation at high powers. In this work the authors show how a new design paradigm based on diffusion-driven charge transport (DDCT) and selective-area growth (SAG) of GaN {{can be used to}} reduce the resistive losses of LEDs below the level achievable with presently available structures. The authors carry out full device simulations and demonstrate SAG of both n- and p-doped GaN on device templates with InGaN quantum wells that can be excited using DDCT. The results indicate that especially when combined with material composition grading, the new approach offers the possibility to <b>substantially</b> reduce the <b>resistive</b> heating in high-power LEDs...|$|R
