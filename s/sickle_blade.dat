50|$|The {{development}} of the sickle in Mesopotamia {{can be traced back}} to times that pre-date the Neolithic Era. Large quantities of <b>sickle</b> <b>blades</b> have been excavated in sites surrounding Israel that have been dated to the Epipaleolithic era (18000-8000 BC). Formal digs in Wadi Ziqlab, Jordan have unearthed various forms of early <b>sickle</b> <b>blades.</b> The artifacts recovered ranged from 10 to 20 cm in length and possessed a jagged edge. This intricate ‘tooth-like’ design showed a greater degree of design and manufacturing credence than most of the other artifacts that were discovered. <b>Sickle</b> <b>blades</b> found during this time were made of flint, straight and used in more of a sawing motion than with the more modern curved design. Flints from these sickles have been discovered near Mt. Carmel, which suggest the harvesting of grains from the area about 10,000 years ago.|$|R
50|$|A stone <b>sickle</b> <b>blade</b> {{has been}} recovered. This was secured to a wooden handle to harvest grain. Evidence of baskets woven from wild grass has been uncovered. These {{were used to}} carry grain from the harvests. Remnants of a {{spinning}} loom have been found, indicating the production of cloth, probably from hemp fibers. Among the many tools and utensils unearthed at Jiahu are three-legged earthenware cooking pots with tight-fitting lids, {{and a variety of}} stone implements, including arrowheads, barbed harpoons, spades, axes, awls, and chisels.|$|E
50|$|It is {{situated}} in {{the valley of the}} Upper Hasbani (Wadi el-Fatir) on the right bank, north-east of the village of Dnaibe, east of the road. It was first recorded by A. Kuschke in 1954 followed by Lorraine Copeland and J. King in 1966 and lastly by Jacques Besançon and Francis Hours in 1968. Besançon recovered a fragment from an arrowhead a pick or hammer and a serrated <b>sickle</b> <b>blade.</b> These gave a very slight dating suggesting Ubaid occupation equivalent to early neolithic Byblos.|$|E
5000|$|A flint <b>sickle</b> <b>blade</b> {{found at}} Scarrington in 1981 was dated {{to the late}} Neolithic age. There is also {{evidence}} that Scarrington was inhabited in Roman times (in the 2nd or 3rd century AD), {{in the shape of}} tools and remains of a villa. These were found during the laying of a water pipe in February/March 1991 between the village and Car Colston. Scarrington is noted in Domesday Book in 1086 as [...] "Scarintone" [...] and as belonging to the king. It had 27 households.|$|E

50|$|An {{archaeological site}} at Kfar Giladi was {{excavated}} by J. Kaplan in 1957 and 1962. It revealed remains four stages of occupation in different periods. An early neolithic stage was suggested to date between 6400 and 5800 BC. Finds included Dark faced burnished ware with incisions and rope patterns. Flints included axes, adzes, arrowheads and denticulated <b>sickle</b> <b>blade</b> elements. Similar finds {{were located in}} a later neolithic stage including a female clay figurine dating between 5800 and 5400 BC. Two later periods of occupation were attributed to chalcolithic occupations similar to Wadi Rabah.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{material}} recovered from this open cast site came from surface finds along with a 7 ft to 8 ft core of Neolithic deposits. Neolithic levels revealed evidence of stone-wall footings {{and a series of}} distinctive cream, lime-plaster floors. Black, beige or brown flint was knapped at the site, and tools recovered included numerous scrapers, cores for blades, Byblos- and Amouq-point arrowheads, javelins, <b>sickle</b> <b>blade</b> elements, burins and borers. Lebanese sites of this date usually reveal heavy tools, but only two hand axes were recovered at this site. A stone bowl with a fine bead rim was also found.|$|E
50|$|Kefraya {{was also}} once {{home to the}} Qaraoun culture with a Heavy Neolithic archaeological {{industry}} prior to the Neolithic Revolution. A very large archaeological site was discovered in the area running along {{both sides of the}} road. Good quality flint nodules were found amongst Eocene conglomerates where a Heavy Neolithic factory site was detected with a massive abundance of Levallois cores, debitage and waste littering the surface of the site. Large numbers of flint tools were collected by workers that included a variety of scrapers on flakes, kinves, axes, adzes and a segmented <b>sickle</b> <b>blade.</b> The type of flint found in the area was termed Kefraya flint.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the use-wear analysis of a sample of lithic artifacts from the Torre Sabea assemblage. Due to the presence of post-depositional alterations the analyses have been focused mainly on two categories of implements: <b>sickle</b> <b>blades</b> and microlithic tools. In both cases, a detailed interpretation of the results is given considering data from a broad geographical context. <b>Sickle</b> <b>blades</b> production and use seem to belong to a specific cultural and geographical context. Microlithic tools were probably employed in a variety of foraging activities of diverse symbolic and economic value. This study contributes to the knowledge of the Torre Sabea site and, more in general, to the understanding of how certain categories of tools were used in the Early Neolithic societies in the Western Mediterranean.

25|$|Along the Nile in the 12th millennium, an Upper Paleolithic grain-grinding culture {{using the}} {{earliest}} type of <b>sickle</b> <b>blades</b> {{had replaced the}} culture of hunting, fishing, and hunter-gatherers using stone tools. Evidence also indicates human habitation and cattle herding in the southwestern corner of Egypt near the Sudan border before the 8th millennium BC.|$|R
50|$|At this stage, large {{quantities}} of copper and tin ingots (i.e., 10 tons of Cu and 3 tons of Sn ingots in one cargo of Uluburun shipwreck from the 14th century BCE) were found all over the coasts of the Mediterranean and in several shipwrecks under the sea, mainly off the southern coast of Turkey. In Canaan at that time, Cypriot, Egyptian, Syrian, and Mesopotamian types of bronze objects were found, besides the local Canaanite metal collection. These were all basically made of tin bronze. The “prestige” objects like <b>sickle</b> <b>blade</b> swords or cast-hilt daggers were alloyed with highquality (11-13% by weight) Sn, whereas the simpler and probably less expensive objects had lower levels of tin in the metal.|$|E
50|$|Ourrouar II is 500 m east of {{the bridge}} over Nahr Ghedir on slopes of {{cemented}} conglomerates behind two empty houses. The site was discovered and Heavy Neolithic material recovered along with traces of other morphologies by Peter Wescombe in 1965. Finds included a rough, celt-shaped axe, numerous short, heavy picks, a chopper, burins, flakes and blades in poor quality grey flint, several of which were rather large in size. Another smaller group of tools {{was found on the}} lower and western slopes made of flint that had patinated to white that included steep-scrapers and <b>sickle</b> <b>blade</b> elements. The lower slopes of the site were destroyed during new road construction. Material is held by the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Andrew Moore suggested that the station was a factory site for Heavy Neolithic tools of the Qaraoun culture.|$|E
5000|$|A Canaanean blade is {{an archaeological}} {{term for a}} long, wide blade made out of stone or flint, {{predominantly}} found at sites in Israel and Lebanon (ancient Canaan). They were first manufactured and used in the Neolithic Stone Age {{to be used as}} weapons such as javelins or arrowheads. The same technology was used during the later Chalcolithic period in the production of broad <b>sickle</b> <b>blade</b> elements for harvesting of crops. Canaanean blades were also used in the threshing of cereal grains. This indicates the presence of early agricultural technologies. The blades would be attached to a small wooden platform with bitumen. The platform, with a human or other weight standing on it, was then pulled behind an animal across a threshing floor. The forward motion of the animal paired with the downward force of weight exerted through the blades served to cut grain into small pieces.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sickle</b> <b>blades</b> {{also appear}} {{for the first}} time in the Natufian lithic industry. The {{characteristic}} sickle-gloss shows that they were used to cut the silica-rich stems of cereals, indirectly suggesting the existence of incipient agriculture. Shaft straighteners made of ground stone indicate the practice of archery. There are heavy ground-stone bowl mortars as well.|$|R

The 'Aswadian' variant was {{recently}} abolished {{by the work}} of Danielle Stordeur in her initial report from further investigations in 2001-2006. The PPNB horizon was moved back at this site, to around 10,700 BP.|$|R
50|$|Common {{artifacts}} from the Cishan culture include stone grinders, stone sickles and tripod pottery. The <b>sickle</b> <b>blades</b> feature fairly uniform serrations, which made the harvesting of grain easier. Cord markings, used as decorations on the pottery, was more common compared to neighboring cultures. Also, the Cishan potters created a broader variety of pottery forms such as basins, pot supports, serving stands, and drinking cups.|$|R
5000|$|Orange slice is {{an early}} <b>sickle</b> <b>blade</b> element made out of flint. The flints are so called due to their shape, which resembles a segment of an Orange. The {{morphology}} was first recognized by J. Hamal-Nandrin and J. Servais in 1928, who called them [...] "Quartier d'orange" [...] in French. This sickle industry has no evidence of developed denticulation. Orange slices were used for harvesting plants {{at the start of}} the Neolithic revolution and were particularly prevalent in Lebanon where they were found alongside Heavy Neolithic axes and larger flint tools of the Qaraoun culture in and around Qaraoun in the south of the country. Sites where orange slices have been found include Mejdel Anjar I, Dakwe I and II, Habarjer III, Qaraoun I and II, Kefraya, and Beıdar Chamout. Orange slices were only found in large quantities around Qaraoun, where it is suggested they were part of a specialist Neolithic industry of the area.|$|E
50|$|Zargen (Zāgen) is a Grim Reaper-themed fighter with a <b>sickle</b> <b>blade</b> {{in place}} of a left hand. In Episode 15, he joins Galdos' group during the initial attack on Metalder. In Episode 18, he had a dream in which Metalder brings down the Ghost Bank. Zargen's scheme to prevent that {{involves}} the public abduction of a scientist transporting a briefcase containing valuable information. Metalder takes the bait and retrieves the briefcase. The scientist was a fake, however, but the bomb inside the case fails to destroy Metalder. Before his next battle with Metalder, Zargen asks God Neros to implant him with an explosive device, in order to guarantee his victory. If Metalder struck him directly in close combat, the bomb would destroy them both. During the battle, he lodges his armblade into Metalder's right shoulder and attempts to finish the task with an electric discharge from the spikes on his head. To Zargen's surprise, Metalder severs his own arm to put distance between them. Metalder then throws his severed arm at Zargen's torso, triggering the bomb and destroying him.|$|E

When he enters Combat Mode his power {{seemingly}} increases and he gains the ability to change at least his right arm into a sword or a kind of shield, though he also uses a <b>sickle</b> <b>blade</b> from his forearm. Dagger has a love/hate relationship with Dustis - she loves him, he kind of just goes along with it, though it is clear Dustis does all the chasing and Dagger does lots and lots of running. He's younger than most others and asks the most questions, mostly from inexperience and can be a bit too cocky when in combat which may lead to him being surprised. His personality changes drastically when in 'combat' mode, as he is louder, more talkative, foul mouthed and mischievous, whilist his normal persona is still rather sarcastic, sadistic but quieter and speaks in a more polite tone.|$|E

500|$|The wider {{area of the}} Shfela {{has been}} {{inhabited}} for much longer. Excavations were conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) about 12 kilometres northeast from Bayt Jibrin at a site located on the same wadi, Nahal Guvrin, near moshav Menuha. The IAA has unearthed there artifacts from a village believed to be 6,500 years old, placing {{it at the end}} of the Stone Age or at the beginning of the Chalcolithic or [...] "copper-and-stone age". The finds include pottery vessels and stone tools, among them flint <b>sickle</b> <b>blades,</b> cultic objects, clay figurines of horned animals, ceramic spindle whorls and animal bones belonging to pigs, goats, sheep and larger herbivores. The inhabitants probably chose this area due to the arable land and copious springs flowing even in the rainless summer months. Archaeologists believe the villagers grew grain, as indicated by the <b>sickle</b> <b>blades</b> and the grinding and pounding tools, and raised animals that supplied milk, meat and wool, as attested to by the spindle whorls. The settlement was small in scope, approximately 1.5 dunams, but there is evidence of bartering, based on the presence of basalt vessels and other lithic objects brought to the site from afar.|$|R
