25|$|<b>Stereopsis</b> {{recovery}}, also {{recovery from}} stereoblindness, is {{the phenomenon of}} a stereoblind person gaining partial or full ability of stereo vision (<b>stereopsis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Among the {{investigations}} into post-surgical <b>stereopsis</b> is {{a publication of}} 2005 that reported on a total of 43 adults over 18 years of age who had surgical correction after having lived with from constant-horizontal strabismus for more than 10 years with no previous surgery or <b>stereopsis,</b> with visual acuity of 20/40 or more also in the deviating eye; in this group, <b>stereopsis</b> was present in 80% of exotropes and 31% of esotropes, with the recovery of <b>stereopsis</b> and stereoacuity being uncorrelated {{to the number of}} years the deviation had persisted. A study that was published 2006 included, aside an extensive review of investigations on <b>stereopsis</b> recovery of the last decades, a re-evaluation of all those patients who had had congenital or early-onset strabismus with a large constant horizontal divergence and had undergone strabismus surgery in the years 1997–1999 in a given clinic, excluding those who had a history of neurologic or systemic diseases or with organic retinal diseases. Among the resulting 36 subjects aged 6–30 years, many had regained binocular vision (56% according to an evaluation with Bagolini striated glasses, 39% with Titmus test, 33% with Worth 4-dot test, and 22% with Random dot E test) and 57% had stereoacuity of 200 sec of arc of better, leading to the conclusion that some degrees of <b>stereopsis</b> can be achieved even in cases of infantile or early-childhood strabism. Another study  found that some chronically strabismic adults with good vision could recover fusion and <b>stereopsis</b> by means of surgical alignment.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a growing}} recent body of {{scientific}} literature on investigations into the recovery of <b>stereopsis</b> in adults which started to appear shortly before Oliver Sacks' The New Yorker publication drew public attention to Barry's discovery. A number of scientific publications have systematically assessed patients' post-surgical <b>stereopsis,</b> whereas other studies have investigated the effects of eye training procedures.|$|E
25|$|For decades, {{researchers}} {{assumed that}} humans had to acquire binocular vision, in particular <b>stereopsis,</b> {{in early childhood}} or they would never gain it. In recent years, however, successful improvements in persons with amblyopia, convergence insufficiency or other stereo vision anomalies have become prime examples of neuroplasticity; binocular vision improvements and <b>stereopsis</b> recovery are now active areas of scientific and clinical research.|$|E
25|$|Recovering {{stereo vision}} {{as far as}} {{possible}} has long been established as an approach to the therapeutic treatment of stereoblind patients. Treatment aims to recover stereo vision in very young children, as well as in patients who had acquired but lost their ability for <b>stereopsis</b> due to a medical condition. In contrast, this aim has normally not been present in the treatment of those who missed out on learning <b>stereopsis</b> during their first few years of life. In fact, the acquisition of binocular and stereo vision was long thought to be impossible unless the person acquired this skill during a critical period in infancy and early childhood. This hypothesis normally went unquestioned and has formed the basis for the therapeutic approaches to binocular disorders for decades. It has been put in doubt in recent years. In particular since studies on <b>stereopsis</b> recovery began to appear in scientific journals and it became publicly known that neuroscientist Susan R. Barry achieved <b>stereopsis</b> well into adulthood, that assumption is in retrospect considered to have held the status of a scientific dogma.|$|E
25|$|Very recently, {{there has}} been a rise in {{scientific}} investigations into <b>stereopsis</b> recovery in adults and youths who have had no stereo vision before. While it has now been shown that an adult may gain <b>stereopsis,</b> it is currently not yet possible to predict how likely a stereoblind person is to do so, nor is there general agreement on the best therapeutic procedure. Also the possible implications for the treatment of children with infantile esotropia are still under study.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stereopsis</b> {{recovery}} {{has been}} reported to have occurred in a few adults as a result of either medical treatments including strabismus surgery and vision therapy, or spontaneously after a stereoscopic 3D cinema experience.|$|E
25|$|Also when {{children}} with congenital (infantile) strabismus (e.g. infantile esotropia) receive strabismus surgery {{within the first}} few years or two of their life, this goes along with the hope that they may yet develop their full potential for binocular vision including <b>stereopsis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most renowned case of regained <b>stereopsis</b> {{is that of}} neuroscientist Susan R. Barry, who had had {{alternating}} infantile esotropia with diplopia, but no amblyopia, underwent three surgical corrections {{in childhood}} without achieving binocular vision at the time, and recovered from stereoblindness in adult age after vision therapy with optometrist Theresa Ruggiero. Barry's case has been reported on by neurologist Oliver Sacks. Also David H. Hubel, winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Torsten Wiesel for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system, commented positively on her case. In 2009, Barry published a book Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions, reporting on her own and several other cases of <b>stereopsis</b> recovery.|$|E
25|$|Very small {{differences}} between images, however, might yield singleness {{of vision and}} <b>stereopsis.</b> Binocular rivalry has been extensively studied in the last century. In recent years neuroscientists have used neuroimaging techniques and single-cell recording techniques to identify neural events responsible for the perceptual dominance of a given image and for the perceptual alternations.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, in a {{study in}} which a group of 17 adults and older {{children}} of at least 8 years of age, all of whom received strabismus surgery and post-operative evaluation after long-standing untreated infantile esotropia, most showed binocular fusion when tested with Bagolini lenses and an increased visual field, but none demonstrated stereo fusion or <b>stereopsis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In contrast, in a {{case where}} a child's eyes are {{straightened}} surgically {{after the age of}} about five or six years and the child had no opportunity to develop stereo vision in early childhood, normally the clinical expectation is that this intervention will lead to cosmetic improvements but not to stereo vision. Conventionally, no follow-up for <b>stereopsis</b> was performed in such cases.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{investigations}} on residual neural plasticity {{in adulthood}} now also include {{studies on the}} recovery of <b>stereopsis.</b> Now {{it is a matter}} of active scientific investigation under which conditions and to which degree binocular fusion and stereo vision can be acquired in adulthood, especially if the person is not known to have had any preceding experience of stereo vision, and how outcomes may depend on the patient's history of therapeutic interventions.|$|E
25|$|Apart from Barry, another {{formerly}} stereoblind adult whose acquired {{ability for}} <b>stereopsis</b> has received media attention is neuroscientist Bruce Bridgeman, {{professor of psychology}} and psychobiology at University of California Santa Cruz, {{who had grown up}} nearly stereoblind and acquired stereo vision spontaneously in 2012 at the age of 67, when watching the 3D movie Hugo with polarizing 3D glasses. The scene suddenly appeared to him in depth, and the ability to see the world in stereo stayed with him also after leaving the cinema.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stereopsis</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Wheatstone in 1838. In 1840 {{he was awarded}} the Royal Medal of the Royal Society for his explanation of binocular vision, a research which led him to make stereoscopic drawings and construct the stereoscope. He showed that our impression of solidity is gained by the combination in the mind of two separate pictures of an object taken by both of our eyes from different points of view. Thus, in the stereoscope, an arrangement of lenses or mirrors, two photographs of the same object taken from different points are so combined as to make the object stand out with a solid aspect. Sir David Brewster improved the stereoscope by dispensing with the mirrors, and bringing it into its existing form with lenses.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, however, <b>stereopsis</b> {{recovery}} {{is known to}} have occurred in a number of adults. While this has in some cases occurred after visual exercises or spontaneous visual experiences, recently also the medical community's view of strabismus surgery has become more optimistic with regard to outcomes in terms of binocular function and possibly <b>stereopsis.</b> As one author states: ...|$|E
2500|$|Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley {{have stated}} that perceptual {{learning}} appears {{to play an important}} role. One investigation, published 2011, reported on a study on human <b>stereopsis</b> recovery using perceptual learning which was inspired by Barry's work. In this study, a small number of stereoblind subjects who had initially been stereoblind or stereoanomalous recovered <b>stereopsis</b> using perceptual learning exercises. Alongside the scientific assessment of the extent of recovery, also the subjective outcomes are described: [...] "After achieving <b>stereopsis,</b> our observers reported that the depth “popped out,” which they found very helpful and joyful in their everyday life. The anisometropic observer GD noticed “a surge in depth” one day when shopping in a supermarket. While playing table tennis, she feels that she is able to track a ping-pong ball more accurately and therefore can play better. Strabismic observer AB is more confident now when walking down stairs because she can judge the depth of the steps better. Strabismics AB, DP, and LR, are able to enjoy 3D movies for the first time, and strabismic GJ finds it easier to catch a fly ball while playing baseball." [...] In a follow-up study, the authors of this study pointed out that the <b>stereopsis</b> that was recovered following perceptual learning was more limited in resolution and precision compared to normal subjects' <b>stereopsis.</b> Dennis M. Levi was awarded the 2011 Charles F. Prentice Medal of the American Academy of Optometry for this work.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{theories}} were {{proposed to}} account for binocular rivalry. Porta and Dutour took it as evidence for an ancient theory of visual perception {{that has come to}} be known as suppression theory. Its essential idea is that, despite having two eyes, we see only one of everything (known as singleness of vision) because we see with one eye at a time. According to this theory, we do not normally notice the alternations between the two eyes because their images are too similar. By making the images very different, Porta and Dutour argued, this natural alternation can be seen. Wheatstone, on the other hand, supported the alternative theory of singleness of vision, fusion theory, proposed by Aristotle. Its essential idea is that we see only one of everything because the information from the two eyes is combined or fused. Wheatsone also discovered binocular <b>stereopsis,</b> the perception of depth arising from the lateral placement of the eyes. Wheatstone was able to prove that <b>stereopsis</b> depended on the different horizontal positions (the horizontal disparity) of points in the images viewed by each eye by creating the illusion of depth from flat depictions of such images displayed in his stereoscope. Such <b>stereopsis</b> is impossible unless information is being combined from each eye. Although Wheatstone's discovery of <b>stereopsis</b> supported fusion theory, he still had {{to account for}} binocular rivalry. He regarded binocular rivalry as a special case in which fusion is impossible, saying [...] "the mind is inattentive to impressions made on one retina when it cannot combine the impressions on the two retinae together so as to occasion a perception resembling that of some external object" [...] (p.264).|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{conditions}} {{are known to}} be a prerequisite for stereo vision, for instance, that the amount of horizontal deviation, if any is present, needs to be small. In several studies it has been recognized that surgery to correct strabismus can have the effect of improving binocular function. One of these studies, published in 2003, explicitly concluded: [...] "We found that improvement in binocularity, including <b>stereopsis,</b> can be obtained in a substantial portion of adults." [...] That article was published together with a discussion of the results among peers in which the scientific and social implications of the medical treatment were addressed, for example concerning the long-term relevancy of <b>stereopsis,</b> the importance of avoiding diplopia, the necessity of predictable outcomes, and psychosocial and socioeconomic relevance.|$|E
2500|$|Common to Barry and {{at least}} one person on whom she had {{reported}} is the finding that also their mental representation of space changed after having acquired stereo vision: that even with one eye closed the feeling is to see [...] "more" [...] than seeing with one eye closed before recovering <b>stereopsis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Dysmetropsia in one eye, {{a case of}} aniseikonia, {{can present}} with {{symptoms}} such as headaches, asthenopia, reading difficulties, depth perception problems, or double vision. The visual distortion can cause uncorrelated images to stimulate corresponding retinal regions simultaneously impairing fusion of the images. [...] Without suppression {{of one of the}} images symptoms from mild poor <b>stereopsis,</b> binocular diplopia and intolerable rivalry can occur.|$|E
2500|$|Her book {{includes}} {{reports of}} further {{persons who have}} had similar experiences with <b>stereopsis</b> recovery. Barry cites the personal experiences of several persons, including {{a man who was}} an artist and described his experience of seeing with <b>stereopsis</b> as [...] "that he could see one hundred more times negative space", a woman who had been amblyopic before seeing in 3D described how empty space now [...] "looks and feels palpable, tangible—alive!", a woman who had been strabismic since age two and saw in 3D after taking vision therapy and stated that [...] "The coolest thing is the feeling you get being “in the dimension”", a woman who felt quite alarmed at the experience of suddenly seeing roadside trees and signs looming towards her, and two women who experienced an abrupt onset of stereo vision with a wide-angled view of the world, the first stating: [...] "I was able to take in so much more of the room than I did before" [...] and the second: [...] "It was very dramatic as my peripheral vision suddenly filled in on both sides".|$|E
2500|$|Cattle are a prey {{animal and}} to assist {{predator}} detection, {{their eyes are}} located {{on the sides of}} their head rather than the front. [...] This gives them a wide field of view of 330° but limits binocular vision (and therefore <b>stereopsis)</b> to 30° to 50° compared to 140° in humans. [...] This means they have a blind spot directly behind them. [...] Cattle have good visual acuity (1/20) but compared to humans, the visual accommodation of cattle is poor.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{system of}} dichoptic {{presentation}} for binocular vision therapy {{has been proposed}} by researchers of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre. Using a modified puzzle video game Tetris, the interocular suppression of patients with amblyopia was successfully treated with dichotomic training in which certain parameters of the training material were systematically adapted {{during the course of}} four weeks. Clinical supervision of such procedures is required to ensure that double vision does not occur. Most of the patients who underwent this treatment gained improved visual acuity of the weaker eye, and some also showed increased stereoacuity. Another study performed at the same institute showed that dichoptic training can be more effective in adults than the more conventional amblyopia treatment of an eye patch. For this investigation, 18 adults played the game Tetris for one hour each day, half of the group wearing eye patches and the other half playing a dichoptic version of the game. After two weeks, the group who played dichoptically showed a significant improvement of vision in the weaker eye and in <b>stereopsis</b> acuity; the eye patch group had moderate improvements, which increased substantially after they, too, were given the dichoptic training afterwards. Dichoptic-based perceptual learning therapy, presented by means of a head-mounted display, is amenable also to amblyopic children, as it improves both the amblyopic eye's visual acuity and the stereo function. The researchers at McGill University have shown that one to three weeks of playing a dichoptic video game for one to two hours on a hand-held device [...] "can improve acuity and restore binocular function, including <b>stereopsis</b> in adults". Furthermore, {{it has been suggested that}} these effect can be enhanced by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).|$|E
2500|$|Sight or vision (adjectival form: visual/optical) is the {{capability}} of the eye(s) to focus and detect images of visible light on photoreceptors in the retina of each eye that generates electrical nerve impulses for varying colors, hues, and brightness. [...] There {{are two types of}} photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are very sensitive to light, but do not distinguish colors. [...] Cones distinguish colors, but are less sensitive to dim light. There is some disagreement as to whether this constitutes one, two or three senses. Neuroanatomists generally regard it as two senses, given that [...] different receptors are responsible for the perception of color and brightness. Some argue that <b>stereopsis,</b> the perception of depth using both eyes, also constitutes a sense, but it is generally regarded as a cognitive (that is, post-sensory) function of the visual cortex of the brain where patterns and objects in images are recognized and interpreted based on previously learned information. This is called visual memory.|$|E
2500|$|Proper {{development}} of normal visual acuity {{depends on a}} human or an animal having normal visual input when it is very young. Any visual deprivation, that is, anything interfering with such input over a prolonged period of time, such as a cataract, severe eye turn or strabismus, [...] anisometropia (unequal refractive error between the two eyes), or covering or patching the eye during medical treatment, will usually result in a severe and permanent decrease in visual acuity and pattern recognition in the affected eye if not treated early in life, a condition known as amblyopia. The decreased acuity is reflected in various abnormalities in cell properties in the visual cortex. These changes include a marked {{decrease in the number}} of cells connected to the affected eye as well as cells connected to both eyes in cortical area V1, resulting in a loss of <b>stereopsis,</b> i.e. depth perception by binocular vision (colloquially: [...] "3D vision"). The period of time over which an animal is highly sensitive to such visual deprivation is referred to as the critical period.|$|E
2500|$|For instance, one author {{summarized}} the accepted scientific {{view of the}} time with the words: [...] "Stereopsis will never be obtained unless amblyopia is treated, the eyes are aligned, and binocular fusion and function are achieved before the critical period for <b>stereopsis</b> ends. Clinical data suggest that this occurs before 24 months of age, {{but we do not}} know exactly when it occurs, because crucial pieces of basic science information are missing." [...] For purposes of illustration, reference is made to a book of doctors' handouts for patients, written for the general public and published in 2002, which summarizes the limitations in the terms in which they, at the time, were fully accepted as medical state of the art as follows: [...] "If an adult has a childhood strabismus that was never treated, it is too late to improve any amblyopia or depth perception, so the goal may be simply cosmetic – to make the eyes appear to be properly aligned – though sometimes treatment does enlarge the extent of side vision." [...] It has only been accepted very recently that the therapeutic approach was based on an unquestioned notion that has, since, been referred to as [...] "myth" [...] or [...] "dogma".|$|E
50|$|The <b>stereopsis</b> {{which an}} {{individual}} can achieve {{is limited by the}} level of visual acuity of the poorer eye. In particular, patients who have comparatively lower visual acuity tend to need relatively larger spatial frequencies to be present in the input images, else they cannot achieve <b>stereopsis.</b> Fine <b>stereopsis</b> requires both eyes to have a good visual acuity in order to detect small spatial differences, and is easily disrupted by early visual deprivation. There are indications that {{in the course of the}} development of the visual system in infants, coarse <b>stereopsis</b> may develop before fine <b>stereopsis</b> and that coarse <b>stereopsis</b> guides the vergence movements which are needed in order for fine <b>stereopsis</b> to develop in a subsequent stage. Furthermore, there are indications that coarse <b>stereopsis</b> is the mechanism that keeps the two eyes aligned after strabismus surgery.|$|E
50|$|Coarse <b>stereopsis</b> (also called gross <b>stereopsis)</b> {{appears to}} be used to judge {{stereoscopic}} motion in the periphery. It provides the sense of being immersed in one's surroundings and is therefore sometimes also referred to as qualitative <b>stereopsis.</b> Coarse <b>stereopsis</b> is important for orientation in space while moving, for example when descending a flight of stairs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stereopsis</b> {{recovery}}, also {{recovery from}} stereoblindness, is {{the phenomenon of}} a stereoblind person gaining partial or full ability of stereo vision (<b>stereopsis).</b>|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{distinct}} aspects to stereopsis: coarse <b>stereopsis</b> and fine <b>stereopsis,</b> and provide depth information of different degree of {{spatial and temporal}} precision.|$|E
5000|$|Fine <b>stereopsis</b> {{is mainly}} based on static differences. It allows the {{individual}} to determine the depth of objects in the central visual area (Panum's fusional area) and is therefore also called quantitative <b>stereopsis.</b> It is typically measured in random-dot tests; persons having coarse but no fine <b>stereopsis</b> are often unable to perform on random-dot tests, also due to visual crowding {{which is based on}} interaction effects from adjacent visual contours. Fine <b>stereopsis</b> is important for fine-motor tasks such as threading a needle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stereopsis</b> is a genus of {{fungi in}} the family Stereopsidaceae. It was {{formerly}} placed {{in the family}} Meruliaceae in the order Polyporales but was found to belong in its own order along with the genus Clavulicium. The genus was circumscribed by English mycologist Derek Reid in 1965. It contains species that form funnel shaped basidiocarps {{as well as the}} corticioid species <b>Stereopsis</b> globosa which was formerly considered a species of Clavulicium. The species <b>Stereopsis</b> humphreyi and <b>Stereopsis</b> vitellina were found to belong in the Agaricales and Atheliales respectively in a molecular phylogenetics study, and because of this do not belong in <b>Stereopsis,</b> but they have not yet been transferred to their own genera.|$|E
50|$|Because {{each eye}} is in a {{different}} horizontal position, each has a slightly different perspective on a scene yielding different retinal images. Normally two images are not observed, but rather a single view of the scene, a phenomenon known as singleness of vision. Nevertheless, <b>stereopsis</b> is possible with double vision. This form of <b>stereopsis</b> was called qualitative <b>stereopsis</b> by Kenneth Ogle.|$|E
50|$|There {{are strong}} {{indications}} that the stereoscopic mechanism consists {{of at least two}} perceptual mechanisms, possibly three. Coarse and fine <b>stereopsis</b> are processed by two different physiological subsystems, with a coarse <b>stereopsis</b> being derived from diplopic stimuli (that is, stimuli with disparities well beyond the range of binocular fusion) and yielding only a vague impression of depth magnitude. Coarse <b>stereopsis</b> appears {{to be associated with the}} magno pathway which processes low spatial frequency disparities and motion, and fine <b>stereopsis</b> with the parvo pathway which processes high spatial frequency disparities. The coarse stereoscopic system seems to be able to provide residual binocular depth information in some individuals who lack fine <b>stereopsis.</b> Individuals have been found to integrate the various stimuli, for example stereoscopic cues and motion occlusion, in different ways.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{hysteresis}} effect associated with <b>stereopsis.</b> Once fusion and <b>stereopsis</b> have stabilized, fusion and <b>stereopsis</b> {{can be maintained}} even if the two images are pulled apart slowly and symmetrically {{to a certain extent}} in the horizontal direction. In the vertical direction, there is a similar but smaller effect. This effect, first demonstrated on a random dot stereogram, was initially interpreted as an extension of Panum's fusional area. Later it was shown that the {{hysteresis effect}} reaches far beyond Panum's fusional area, and that stereoscopic depth can be perceived in random-line stereograms despite the presence of cyclodisparities of about 15 deg, and this has been interpreted as <b>stereopsis</b> with diplopia.|$|E
