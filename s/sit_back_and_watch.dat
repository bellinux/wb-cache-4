In 1869, businessman Isaac Coffin built the first beach-front cottage to receive paying guests. During those days, people arrived by stage coach and ferry.

500|$|During the {{non-stop}} {{protests in}} Ottawa, Lawrence Cannon requested the Government of Sri Lanka {{for an immediate}} ceasefire. He also rejected calls from the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in Canada to stop all protests in Ottawa. Cannon condemned the LTTE for preventing civilians from leaving areas being attacked and using them as human shields. Bev Oda and the Conservative Party of Canada both condemned the use of LTTE flags, insisting that they symbolize connection with a terrorist organization. David Miller and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty also condemned the Gardiner Expressway blockade. Liberal Party of Canada leader Michael Ignatieff had made statements on the protests in a few occasions. Ignatieff urged the Harper government to break its silence and take initiative in condemning the violence. He stated {{that there are no}} military solutions to the conflict and that the war must stop under a worldwide initiative and internationally coordinated diplomatic strategy. On 21 April, Ignatieff met with a few Tamil leaders in Ottawa to discuss the humanitarian crisis. On the occasion, he said the following: [...] "I am deeply concerned about escalating violence in Sri Lanka, and the resulting deaths of thousands of civilians. It was important for me to hear from Tamil Canadians, whose family and friends in Sri Lanka are suffering first hand from this crisis. We cannot <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> as thousands of innocent lives are lost in the cross-fire, and we condemn any attempt to use civilians as human shields." ...|$|E

This contrasts greatly with Esme's strong emotional response to almost anything. Although she may remain cool, you can see that she is analyzing and calculating {{to take control of the}} situation. Frank just <b>sits</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>watches</b> the action - often missing something in the conversation, or at least pretending to be uninvolved. Frank could also be considered the buffoon, since he creates an additional obstacle between Amy and Esme by screwing up Esme's finances.|$|R

Brown is {{concerned}} that Richard, the innocent man that he selected at random, may end up being killed {{as a result of}} Ross's plan to draw out Cooper, but Ross is only concerned about his career, and dismisses Brown's guilty conscience. When one attempt after another fails to yield any usable information, Cooper orders Richard killed, and eventually attempts to kill Richard himself. Richard remains completely oblivious to the plot until Maddy decides to thwart Cooper, and testifies in front of the Senate about the plot. Cooper is arrested, while Ross is demoted and replaced by Brown as Director of the CIA. Morris is committed to a mental institution, and Paula severs her romantic interest in Richard, believing that Morris needs her. Maddy agrees to testify against Cooper in exchange for her freedom, after which she is reunited with Richard.|$|R

[...] Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who [...] "don't want to leave", and he encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: [...] "I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence.

When these e-mails were released, however, it [...] "was nothing but mundane mailing lists of tens of thousands of ordinary people who discussed politics online. Back then, too, the ruse worked: Many Western journalists had hyped these non-leaks." [...] According to Tufekci, there are three steps to Wikileaks' [...] "disinformation campaigns": [...] "The first step is to dump many documents at once — rather than allowing journalists to scrutinise them and absorb their significance before publication.

The glimpses I was enabled to get of the workings of this little journal gave me the impression that Comrade White was not attached with any paternal fervour to Cosy Moments. He regarded it, I deduced, not so much as a life-work as in the light of an investment. I assumed that Comrade White had his price, and wrote to my father, who was visiting Carlsbad at the moment, to ascertain what that price might be. He cabled it to me. It was reasonable. Now it so happens that an uncle of mine some years ago left me a considerable number of simoleons, and though I shall not be legally entitled actually to close in on the opulence for a matter of nine months or so, I anticipated that my father would have no objection to staking me to the necessary amount on the security of my little bit of money. My father has spent some time of late hurling me at various professions, and we had agreed some time ago that the Law was to be my long suit. Paper-owning, however, may be combined with being Lord Chancellor, and I knew he would have no objection to my being a Napoleon of the Press on this side.

40|$|Thesis (MA (Dogmatics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 König is a {{contemporary}} and influential theologian and his views {{can not be}} ignored (Strauss, 2004 : 123). König (2002 : 13) regards himself as a reformed theologian, but his doctrine on providence differ from the classic reformed view. In some cases, König's theology is viewed as reformed (eg. his doctrine on justification) but not in all cases, as with the doctrine of providence (Strauss, 2004 : 139). According to König (2002 : 33) the classic Reformed understanding of providence is not comforting. Also, according to König, the classic reformed view of providence makes God an evil God who ordains evil, <b>and</b> then <b>sits</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>watches</b> as it unfolds. König's (2002 : 237) solution for the problem of the classic reformed view is that God is not fully in control, but that He will be in control one day. This view of König is in conflict with the reformed confession which confess that God through his providential hand maintains and governs all things. In König's (2002 : 226) doctrine of providence he shifts the omnipotence of the Father to the Son. This shift has great implications for different aspects of the reformed dogma, such as the doctrine of the Trinity, Covenant and Election. The conclusion is that König's doctrine of providence is not comforting {{in the light of the}} reformed confession, and that it only causes more confusion and distress. Master...|$|R

They traveled with a fishing boat from England and were put to shore at Bjørnør on Fosen and traveled by foot to Namdalseid.
