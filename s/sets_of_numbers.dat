5|$|Znám's problem {{concerns}} <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> {{such that}} each {{number in the}} set divides but is not equal to the product {{of all the other}} numbers, plus one. Without the inequality requirement, the values in Sylvester's sequence would solve the problem; with that requirement, it has other solutions derived from recurrences similar to the one defining Sylvester's sequence. Solutions to Znám's problem have applications to the classification of surface singularities (Brenton and Hill 1988) and to the theory of nondeterministic finite automata.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Kurt Gödel {{published}} the incompleteness theorems, which he proved {{in part by}} showing how to represent the syntax of formal logic within first-order arithmetic. Each expression of the formal language of arithmetic is assigned a distinct number. This procedure is known variously as Gödel numbering, coding and, more generally, as arithmetization. In particular, various sets of expressions are coded as <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers.</b> It turns out that for various syntactic properties (such as being a formula, being a sentence, etc.), these sets are computable. Moreover, any computable set of numbers can be defined by some arithmetical formula. For example, there are formulas {{in the language of}} arithmetic defining the set of codes for arithmetic sentences, and for provable arithmetic sentences.|$|E

25|$|Many {{mathematical}} objects, such as <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> and functions, exhibit {{internal structure}} {{as a consequence}} of operations or relations that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance number theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or structures) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of abstraction, to state axioms for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study groups, rings, fields and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of abstract algebra.|$|E

Hence it is the greatest element of the order. [...] Other frequent terms for the least and greatest elements is bottom and top or zero and unit.|$|E

2500|$|Above {{the grid}} is a {{distance}} bar scale, notched with sub-units. There are two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> on the scale, one for measuring each grid square by 20 miles, another for measuring each grid square by 100 miles (see diagram). [...] The top bar is the 20m-per-square scale, with every black dot denoting one mile. [...] The bottom bar is the 100m-per-square scale, where {{the length of}} a unit square is divided into two equal 50m sub-squares, and a set of dots and red lines break it down further into lengths of 10 miles. [...] So depending on which scale one chooses, the length of the side of the entire grid (eight squares) could be measured up to 160 miles (using the 20m-per-square scale) or up to 800 miles (using the 100m-per-square scale).|$|E
2500|$|Orders are {{everywhere}} {{in mathematics and}} related fields like computer science. The first order often discussed in primary school is the standard order on the natural numbers e.g. [...] "2 is less than 3", [...] "10 is greater than 5", or [...] "Does Tom have fewer cookies than Sally?". This intuitive concept can be extended to orders on other <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers,</b> such as the integers and the reals. The idea of being greater than or less than another number {{is one of the}} basic intuitions of number systems (compare with numeral systems) in general (although one usually is also interested in the actual difference of two numbers, which is not given by the order). Other familiar examples of orderings are the alphabetical order of words in a dictionary and the genealogical property of lineal descent within a group of people.|$|E

60|$|This, however, {{though it}} looks so plausible, will not bear examination. The {{expression}} “two pebbles and one pebble,” and the expression “three pebbles,” stand indeed for the same aggregation of objects, but they by no means stand for the same physical fact. They are names of the same objects, but of those objects in two different states: though they denote the same things, their connotation is different. Three pebbles in two separate parcels, and three pebbles in one parcel, do not make the same impression on our senses; and the assertion that the very same pebbles may by an alteration of place and arrangement be made to produce either the one set of sensations or the other, though a very familiar proposition, is not an identical one. It is a truth known to us by early and constant experience: an inductive truth; and such truths are {{the foundation of the}} science of Number. The fundamental truths of that science all rest on the evidence of sense; they are proved by showing to our eyes and our fingers that any given number of objects—ten balls, for example—may by separation and re-arrangement exhibit to our senses all the different <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> the sums of which is equal to ten. All the improved methods of teaching arithmetic to children proceed on a knowledge of this fact.
