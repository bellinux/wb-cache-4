5000|$|In Works of Love and Purity of Heart, Kierkegaard skillfully {{examines}} Christian {{ethics and}} the maxim, Love Thy Neighbour. Kierkegaard stressed {{that it was}} Christianity that [...] "discovered the neighbor". [...] Test it, place as the middle term between the lover and the beloved the neighbor, whom one shall love, place as a middle term between two friends the neighbor, whom one shall love, and you will immediately see jealousy. Yet the neighbor is self-denial’s middle term that steps in between self-love’s I and I, but also between erotic love’s and friendship’s I and the other I. .... Love for the neighbor is therefore the <b>eternal</b> <b>equality</b> in loving. Equality is simply not to make distinctions and <b>eternal</b> <b>equality</b> is unconditionally {{not to make the}} slightest distinction, unqualifiedly not to make the slightest distinction. The essential Christian is itself too weighty, in its movements too earnest to scurry about, dancing, in the frivolity of such facile talk about the higher, highest, and the supremely highest. Think of the most cultured person, one of whom we all admiringly say, “He is so cultured!” Then think of Christianity, which says to him, “You shall love the neighbor!” of course, a certain social courtesy, a politeness toward all people, a friendly condescension toward inferiors, a boldly confident attitude before the mighty, a beautifully controlled freedom of spirit, yes, this is culture - do you believe that it is also loving the neighbor? With the neighbor you have the equality of a human being before God. God is the middle term. Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, 1847, Hong p. 44-61 ...|$|R

6000|$|Harry did {{not fail}} to make much capital out of Black Sheep's ill-considered remark; {{with the result that}} several boys, {{including}} the hubshi, demonstrated to Black Sheep the <b>eternal</b> <b>equality</b> of the human race by smacking his head, and his consolation from Aunty Rosa was that it [...] "served him right for being vain." [...] He learned, however, to keep his opinions to himself, and by propitiating Harry in carrying books and the like to secure a little peace. His existence was not too joyful. From nine till twelve he was at school, and from two to four, except on Saturdays. In the evenings he was sent down into the nursery to prepare his lessons for the next day, and every night came the dreaded cross-questionings at Harry's hand. Of Judy he saw but little. She was deeply religious--at six years of age Religion is easy to come by--and sorely divided between her natural love for Black Sheep and her love for Aunty Rosa, who could do no wrong.|$|R
