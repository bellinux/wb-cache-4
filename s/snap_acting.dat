50|$|A {{ball detent}} type limiter transmits force through {{hardened}} balls which rest in detents {{on the shaft}} and are held in place with springs. An over-torque condition pushes the balls out of their detents, thereby decoupling the shaft. It can have single or multiple detent positions, or a <b>snap</b> <b>acting</b> spring which requires a manual reset. There may be a compression adjustment to adjust the torque limit.|$|E
50|$|Rumors of Michelle's {{supposed}} promiscuity spread, {{and she is}} tormented at school, {{where she}} receives no aid from the facility's apathetic counselor, who passive-aggressively blames her for the bullying she is experiencing. Michelle <b>snaps,</b> and begins <b>acting</b> and dressing provocatively, seducing Steve one day after school. Michelle has Steve drive to a secluded area, where she stabs and castrates him, then stages the scene {{to make it appear}} that he was gay, and the victim of a homophobic hate crime. Later, Michelle lures Jake to her apartment, where she ties him up (under the pretense of engaging in kinky sex) and tortures, bludgeons, and dismembers him.|$|R
