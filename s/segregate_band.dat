40|$|The {{grain growth}} {{behaviour}} during reheating between 950 ºC and 1300 ºC of as-cast Al-Nb steel (containing 0. 019 wt% Nb and 0. 057 wt% Al) and rolled Nb-containing steel (containing 0. 028 wt% Nb and 0. 031 wt% Al) have been investigated. In particular {{the role of}} microalloying element segregation during casting and, hence the spatial distribution of microalloying precipitates, on grain boundary pinning during reheating has been considered. The Al-Nb containing steel has been examined in separate initial conditions, including as-cast (segregated structure), homogenised and forged (reduced separation of <b>segregated</b> <b>bands)</b> samples. It was found that microalloy segregation occurred between the dendritic and interdendritic regions, where the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) was 150 ± 50 μm. Nb showed strong segregation into the interdendritic regions resulting in a higher number density of Nb(C,N) precipitates (2. 64 × 104 /mm 2) compared to the dendritic region (0. 73 × 104 /mm 2). However, Al did not show strong segregation resulting in relatively well-distributed AlN precipitates in the matrix (1. 29 × 104 /mm 2 in the interdendritic region and 1. 89 × 104 /mm 2 in the dendritic region). After forging, the separation between the <b>segregated</b> <b>bands</b> was reduced to 65 ± 10 μm from the previous 150 ± 50 μm in the as-cast sample. The increased Nb content in the rolled Nb-containing steel compared to the Al-Nb steel gave a greater extent of segregation in the solute-enriched regions resulting in a larger number density of Nb(C,N) present (5. 9 × 104 /mm 2), whilst the separation between in the <b>segregated</b> <b>bands</b> in the as-rolled Nb-containing steel was 35 ± 10 μm...|$|R

At the threshold of saturation, we found a spectrum of wavelengths with a broad peak. The peak position was nearly independent of the tube rotation rate. The overall growth rate of Fourier modes had a maximum at a particular value of the angular rotation frequency.

40|$|A counter {{intuitive}} axial segregation {{phenomenon in}} a rotating horizontal cylinder has recently captured attention of many researchers in different disciplines. There {{is a growing}} consensus that the interplay between the particle dynamics {{and the evolution of}} the internal structure during the segregation process must be carefully investigated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to non-invasively obtain much needed dynamic/static information such as velocity and concentration profiles, and it has proven to be capable of depicting the evolution of segregation processes. Segregation in a rotating cylinder involves two processes: the first is to transport small particles in the radial direction to form a radial core, and the second is to transform the radial core into axially <b>segregated</b> <b>bands.</b> Percolation and/or "stopping" have been proposed as mechanisms for the radial segregation. As to mechanisms for axial band formation, much less is known. The difference in the dynamic angle of repose has been proposed to segregate different components in the axial direction. Recently, Hill and Kakalios have reported that particles mix or demix depending upon the competition between diffusion and preferential drift whose order can be determined by the dynamic angle of repose through the adjustment of the rotation rate. We claim that the dynamic angle of repose {{could be one of the}} causes, however, it fails to offer reasonable explanations for certain aspects of the axial migration. For example, we always observe that the radial segregation precedes the axial segregation and small particles migrate in the radial direction to form an axially extended radial core. It then transforms into axially <b>segregated</b> <b>bands.</b> By definition, the effects of the dynamic angle of repose are restricted near the free surface where the flowing layer is present. However, during the process of transforming from the radially segregated core to axially <b>segregated</b> <b>bands,</b> small particles located in the deep core region, which is untouched by the flowing layer, also completely disappear. Usually, the dynamics angle of repose are uniquely defined for individual species to characterize particle properties, and the dynamic angle of repose thus defined provides little information for the dynamic angle of repose of the mixture since the concentration ratio and the internal packing structure do not remain the same during the segregation processes. Under microgravity environment, the dynamics angle of repose argument does not hold since there is simply no flowing layer to influence/determine the preferred directions of segregation. We have thus designed an experiment so that the effects of the dynamic angle of repose can be minimized by filling the cylinder almost completely full. Small particles still formed a radial core and also migrated to form axial bands. As ground based experiments we have designed and conducted both 2 D and 3 D segregation experiments. The 2 D experiments are performed using a thin cylinder (the gap between two end caps is about 5 mm) filled with different combinations of particles. The 3 D experiments are conducted with a long cylinder of its length and diameter of 27 cm and 7 cm, respectively. Results of 2 D experiments indicate that different mechanisms govern particle motion in regions near and far from the axis of rotation. Results of 3 D experiments indicate that a series of collapses of microstructures of particle packing (micro-collapses) may be responsible for the creation of voids for small particles to migrate through in the axial direction. We have successfully eliminated the dynamic angle of repose as a cause for segregation, however, by almost completely filling the cylinder with the particles, we have lost an opportunity to investigate a possibility of particle "mobility" being a cause for segregation which requires a flowing surface but not the difference in the angle of repose. This is currently being investigated...|$|R

Linkage information was generated using amplified fragment length polymorphism (ATLP) markers in a mapping panel consisting of 42 individuals derived from a commercial cross. We used 103 primer combinations that produced 741 <b>segregating</b> <b>bands.</b> From them, 477 segregated in a 1 : 1 model, 181 in a 3 : 1 model. 62 fitted both models and 21 fitted neither model. A total of 394 loci with a 1 : 1 segregation ratio were mapped to unique positions in {{the male and female}} maps using a pseudotestcross strategy. A total of 51 and 47 linkage groups were detected for the male and female maps respectively, in comparison to 44 haploid groups expected from the karyotype. The female map covered 2771 Kosambi units (cM) and was 24 % longer than the male map (2116 cM long). The distribution of the mark-m showed that both maps had low saturation and clustering at short linkage distances. Markers with a distorted segregation were observed as previously reported in other shrimp species. The estimated genomic length indicates that the P. vannamei genome has higher recombination rates than closely related species.

Based on available data of solubilities, diffusivities and temperature dependent phase transformations for the matrix and <b>segregated</b> <b>bands,</b> a model of hydrogen distribution in such a heterogeneous microstructure has been developed. Additionally, penny-shaped thin cavities have been introduced to account for the presence of incoherent MnS inclusions leading to a potential decohesion at MnS/matrix interface. Pressure increase in such cavities has been evaluated using ideal gas behavior for hydrogen. A unidimensional Finite Difference numerical approach has been implemented in order to simulate hydrogen redistribution among matrix, segregation_band and cavity. This model has allowed to quantitatively evaluate the redistribution of hydrogen at the scale of the microstructural heterogeneities during the cooling down to 200 degrees C: first,, close to the component surface where important kinetic effects have been demonstrated due to high cooling rate and second, in the bulk, where hydrogen redistribution was close to the thermodynamic equilibrium during the whole cooling period. It has been shown that the final equilibrium pressure of hydrogen in the cavity at 200 degrees C is negligible even for a high initial hydrogen content. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

While frequency information is extracted by mechanical filtering of the cochlea, periodicity information is analyzed by temporal filter mechanisms in the brainstem. In the mammalian auditory midbrain envelope periodicity is represented in maps orthogonal to the representation of sound frequency. However, how periodicity is represented across the cortical surface of primary auditory cortex (AI) remains controversial. Using optical recording of intrinsic signals, we here demonstrate that a periodicity map exists in primary AI of the cat. While pure tone stimulation confirmed the well-known frequency gradient along the rostro-caudal axis of AI, stimulation with harmonic sounds revealed <b>segregated</b> <b>bands</b> of activation, indicating spatially localized preferences to specific periodicities along a dorso-ventral axis, nearly orthogonal to the tonotopic gradient.

40|$|The Finero Phlogopite-Peridotite (FPP) is a {{worldwide}} famous mantle massif recrystallized through several events of melt migrations. These events have enriched the FPP in hydrous phases and crustal components {{and have been}} commonly interpreted as related to a subduction/post orogenic geodynamic setting.

The δ 18 O increases from 5. 81 ‰ in orthopyroxenes at the dykes border to 6. 90 ‰ in cumulitic amphiboles and 8. 60 ‰ in plagioclases.

Two sample material origins were used, introducing another variable; they were termed Phase I and Phase II. For all tests, local strains, failure location, and specimen elongation were tracked using two or three-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC) analysis. The uniaxial specimens were tested in two orthogonal directions to evaluate the anisotropy of the casting. The uniaxial and notched tensile specimens were tested at strain rates of 0. 001 and 10 s- 1 {{to determine the effect}} of strain rate on the constitutive response. Finite element models were developed to estimate effective plastic strain histories and stress state (triaxiality) as a function of notch severity. Samples of all three tensile sample geometries consistently failed beginning at the notch root as opposed to the centre. They failed after accruing on average 14 - 16 % effective plastic strain, and they also showed a marked lack of repeatability in the failure strain distribution, with a standard deviation on average 18 % of the mean failure strain of each sample geometry.

Understanding the macro and micro-circuitry of the EC and its connectivity within the forebrain may shed light on memory function and dysfunction. Here we use an animal model (the rat) to investigate the organization of intrinsic and extrinsic projections in the entorhino-hippocampal circuit. ^ The overarching hypothesis of this thesis is that anatomically distinct circuits within the EC and its efferents constrain information processing in the hippocampus. Cortical and sub-cortical afferents terminate in limited mediolateral portions of the EC that correspond with cytoarchitectonic divisions. The extent to which unique information conveyed by these inputs is integrated within EC associational networks {{and the degree to}} which this integrated information is conveyed to the hippocampus is presently ill defined. ^ Here we examine the organization of intrinsic projections within the EC using antero- and retrograde tracing techniques. We extend previous findings that entorhinal intrinsic projections are organized into three bands (outer, intermediate, inner), which transcend cytoarchitectonic and cortico-cortically defined subdivisions. Further, we explore thalamic projections to the EC bands and downstream targets in the hippocampus. Following EC retrograde tracer injections we conclude that nucleus reuniens afferents respect band boundaries and follow a dorsolateral-to-outer and ventromedial-to-inner band topography. Following retrograde tracer injections along the septotemporal axis of CA 1 we confirm that the reuniens-to-CA 1 projection follows a dorsal-to-septal and ventral-to-temporal topography. Thus, the origins of thalamo-hippocampal and thalamo-entorhinal projections are in accord. Finally, we examine the degree of convergence/divergence in the entorhinal projection to CA 1. Following injections of anterograde tracer within the EC as well as retrograde tracer injections along the septotemporal axis of CA 1 we conclude that the EC III-to-CA 1 projection is organized in a tripartite manner such that the outer band projects to the septal 50 % while the intermediate and inner bands project to the mid-septotemporal and temporal quartiles of CA 1 respectively. ^ Thus, our findings strongly support the hypothesis that associational networks that are the EC bands function to integrate (within <b>band)</b> and <b>segregate</b> (between <b>bands)</b> information and this organization is maintained in the EC-to-CA 1 projection. ...|$|R
40|$|Mixing of {{granular}} solids is a processing {{step in a}} {{wide range}} of industries. The fundamental phenomena in granule mixing are still poorly understood, making it difficult to a priori predict the effectiveness of mixing processes. While mixing of granules is easy when the particles are homogeneous in size, shape and density and other properties, in practice they are not. With such a mixture, homogenizing is far more complex, since the heterogeneous particles tend to segregate, and special care has to be taken in the design of the mixing process to avoid this. In view of the practical need for better understanding and control of solids mixing, the work in this thesis has two closely coupled objectives. The first objective is to obtain a better understanding of segregation mechanisms. This insight should enable the enhancement of mixing and at the same time suppress segregation, or vice versa, namely the deliberate and controlled segregation of a mixture. The second objective is to provide guidelines for mixing operations that can be derived from insights extracted from the data on mixing behaviour at different rotational velocities and fill levels. From this perspective, we here report an extensive numerical study of mixing and segregation in a bed of bidisperse granules in a rotating horizontal drum, which is the simplest relevant geometry in industrial practice. Two types of segregation can occur: fast radial segregation during which smaller or denser particles accumulate along the axis of rotation; and slow axial segregation with fully <b>segregated</b> <b>bands</b> of small and large particles perpendicular to the rotating axis, with in general particle bands of large particles adjacent to the end walls. This thesis reports on both radial and axial segregation phenomena in a horizontally rotating drum. While visual observation of the particle bed was used as a qualitative observation technique to determine the degree of mixing/segregation, in parallel a more quantitative method was developed as well, which was based on calculating the entropy over the systems. By subdividing the system with a lattice, calculating the entropy of mixing in each cell of the lattice, and summarizing them over the system, a measure for the degree of overall segregation was obtained. By using different grids (a 3 D mesh, a 2 D set of slices perpendicular to the axis, or 2 D bars parallel to the axis), different types of segregation could be distinguished. The radial segregation dynamics were investigated in semi- 2 D (very short) drums, which inhibits axial segregation. Diagrams were prepared that visualise the mixing behaviour as function of the Froude number (rotational speed) for systems with different bidisperse systems. It was found that while almost all systems showed radial segregation at low Fr (rolling regime), and most showed inverted radial segregation at high Fr (cataracting or centrifuging regime), at Fr ≈ 0. 56 all systems became radially mixed. This could be understood by assuming a percolation mechanism. In the moving layer on top of the load, smaller particles percolate in between the moving larger particles, down to the centre of the load, as long as the motion is not too fast. The same phenomenon is inverted at high speeds. In between, the flowing layer is expanded in such a way that many large voids are present, which makes the percolation mechanism less selective on the particle size. The little segregation that occurs is negligible, since the two phenomena described above work in different directions. Surprisingly this transitional Fr number is the same for all investigated systems. Since axial segregation is always preceded by radial segregation, it is logical to also study axial segregation. This was done by studying longer drums, which allows axial segregation to develop along the axis. Axial segregation was found for most systems; its occurrence is mostly dictated by differences in size. It was found that for drums that have intermediate length, surprising dynamic behaviour results. The axial segregation developed with low and high frequency oscillations. While the low frequency oscillations could be understood as the development and migration of segregated areas in the system, the higher frequency oscillations, with a period of 10 to 20 revolutions, were not identified before. This oscillatory behaviour is probably coupled to the use of intermediately sized drums, as this behaviour has not been seen with very long drums. We ascribe the oscillations to the influence of the (vertical) end walls, which expose the adjacent particles to different forces than those particles inside the drum load. These differences induce an axial flow in the system. The particles adjacent to the vertical walls tend to be lifted higher than the particles far away from the vertical walls. This creates a concave profile of the load surface throughout the drum, inducing the particles (in the rolling regime) to follow a path away from the vertical walls towards the centre of the drum. Once past the centre, the particles flow back to the vertical walls in response to the locally convex bed profile. Even in this particular flow profile the percolation mechanism is of importance: smaller particles percolate through the flowing layer and end up deeper inside the bed, while the larger particles accumulate on top of the flowing layer and are conveyed back to the vertical walls. Due to the percolation of the small particles the final end configuration must clearly be a banding configuration of large-small-large particle bands. Prolonged rotation of the bed increases the concave form of the flowing layer. This induces fast oscillations and a sudden mixing of a part of the large particle band with the small particle band, giving fast mixing and leading to a configuration, in which a small-particle band is formed below the large-particles bands. Subsequently segregation into three bands (large-small-large) slowly occurs again, after which the asymmetry in the angel of repose further increases. The configuration, in which larger particles accumulate on top of the bed adjacent to the end walls, coincides with a minimum in energy dissipation, which is not present when the systems segregates radially or axially into three pure bands. The effect found implies that the end walls are important in the dynamics of axial segregation. This effect is studied further by varying the end wall properties. The above mentioned fast and slow oscillations vanish in systems that have smoother end walls, while also the rate of segregation decreases; nevertheless the same axially <b>segregated</b> three <b>band</b> (large-small-large) state of mixing resulted finally. Reducing the friction further to completely smooth end walls however changed the final configuration into a two-banded system. Systems with no end wall at all, simulated through periodic end walls, only gave radial segregation over the (considerable) simulated time span. We expect here that as long as there is still a driving force for axial segregation, the absence of the induction of axial flow by the end walls make the transition very slow or impossible. The formation of two axial bands lowers the energy dissipation by the bed, whereas neither radial segregation nor axial segregation into three bands reduced the power absorption at constant angular velocity. While the oscillatory behaviour is relevant in its own right, their study also allows shedding some light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying the segregation mechanisms, and especially the transition from radial to axial segregation. The fact that this is dependent on not only the properties of the granular materials, but also on the geometry and design of the drum, implies that these findings have relevance to the design and operation of processes...|$|R
40|$|Vpu is an 81 -residue {{membrane}} protein encoded by the HIV- 1 genome. NMR experiments {{show that the}} protein folds into two distinct domains, a transmembrane hydrophobic helix and a cytoplasmic domain with two in-plane amphipathic α-helices separated by a linker region. Resonances in one-dimensional solid-state NMR spectra of uniformly 15 N labeled Vpu are clearly <b>segregated</b> into two <b>bands</b> at chemical shift frequencies associated with NH bonds in a transmembrane α-helix, perpendicular to the membrane surface, and with NH bonds in the cytoplasmic helices parallel to the membrane surface. Solid-state NMR spectra of truncated Vpu 2 – 51 (residues 2 – 51), which contains the transmembrane α-helix and the first amphipathic helix of the cytoplasmic domain, and of a construct Vpu 28 – 81 (residues 28 – 81), which contains only the cytoplasmic domain, support this structural model of Vpu in the membrane. Full-length Vpu (residues 2 – 81) forms discrete ion-conducting channels of heterogeneous conductance in lipid bilayers. The most frequent conductances were 22 ± 3 pS and 12 ± 3 pS in 0. 5 M KCl and 29 ± 3 pS and 12 ± 3 pS in 0. 5 M NaCl. In agreement with the structural model, truncated Vpu 2 – 51, which has the transmembrane helix, forms discrete channels in lipid bilayers, whereas the cytoplasmic domain Vpu 28 – 81, which lacks the transmembrane helix, does not. This finding shows that the channel activity {{is associated with the}} transmembrane helical domain. The pattern of channel activity is characteristic of the self-assembly of conductive oligomers in the membrane and is compatible with the structural and functional findings...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test two hypotheses about binaural hearing: (1) that binaural cues are primarily processed in the hemisphere contralateral to the perceived location of a sound; and (2) that the two main binaural cues, interaural timing differences and interaural level differences, are processed in separate channels in the auditory cortex. Magnetoencephalography was used to measure brain responses to dichotic pitches – a perception of pitch created by <b>segregating</b> a narrow <b>band</b> of noise from a wider band of noise – derived from interaural timing or level disparities. Our results show a strong modulation of interhemispheric M 100 amplitudes by ITD cues. When these cues simulated source presentation unilaterally from the right hemispace, M 100 amplitude changed from a predominant right hemisphere pattern to a bilateral pattern. In contrast, ILD cues lacked any capacity to alter the right hemispheric distribution. These data indicate that intrinsic hemispheric biases are large in comparison to any contralaterality biases in the auditory system. Importantly, both types of binaural cue elicited a circa 200 ms latency object-related negativity component, believed to reflect automatic cortical processes involved in distinguishing concurrent auditory objects. These results support the conclusion that ITDs and ILDs are processed by distinct neuronal populations to relatively late stages of cortical processing indexed by the M 100. However information common to the two cues seems to be extracted for use in a subsequent stage of auditory scene segregation indexed by the object related negativity. This may place a new bound {{on the extent to which}} sound location cues are processed in separate channels of the auditory cortex. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We study {{granular}} particles, like sand {{or glass}} beads, that are mixed in a partially filled, horizontal, rotating, cylindrical drum. When particles {{of different sizes}} are placed in the drum spatial segregation of the particles by size is observed. This segregation occurs in two phases. During the first phase, called radial segregation, the smaller particles form a radial core. In the second, called axial segregation, particles <b>segregate</b> into alternating <b>bands</b> along the axis of the drum. We perform a detailed study {{of the characteristics of}} the flow to determine the physical mechanisms driving axial segregation. We characterize the top surface of the flowing layer by tracking particles using a high-speed camera. We then extract average quantities such as velocity and diffusion. The average velocities show surprising behavior: Particles in small particle bands have a higher downhill flow velocity than particles in large particle bands. We also observe that there is a pattern of sideways velocity as a function of position down the flow. Particles flow into small particle bands {{in the middle of the}} flow but flow out of small particle bands at the bottom. We present the framework for a new model based on our experimentally observed results. We explain the axial band formation in terms of the observed surface flow patterns. Our framework connects differences in flow velocities on the surface of the drum with the radial segregation in the bulk of the drum. We compare these results to current models. We test the general model assumption that the particles always flow in the direction of steepest descent by measuring the surface height of the banded state with a laser line. We find that although there is some indication that particles flow in the direction of steepest descent, there is strong flow that is not in the direction of steepest descent, contrary to the given models. Finally, we study oscillating patterns in mixtures of three sizes of glass beads. Ternary mixtures of particles form bands within bands of the different particle sizes. For certain experimental conditions we observe traveling and oscillating patterns...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. October 2010. Major: Geophysics. Advisor: David L. Kohlstedt. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 163 pages, appendix A. Melt extraction from Earth's upper mantle requires transport of magma from regions of partial melting at depth to the Earth's surface. During its ascent, melt interacts chemically and mechanically with the rock matrix. Melt reduces the viscosity of the partially molten rock {{compared to that}} of a melt-free rock. This weakening is a potential mechanism of strain localization that could have significant geodynamical implications. Magma interacts chemically with mineral phases during its ascent, dissolving phases in which it is undersaturated and precipitating phases in which it is oversaturated. Such melt-rock reaction can be a driving force for melt migration. Water and other volatiles also partition into the melt from minerals and are then expelled to Earth's oceans or atmosphere. This process leaves behind stronger dehydrated rocks, and it could be the mechanism by which the oceanic lithosphere (mechanical boundary layer) is formed. The work presented here is an experimental investigation of several mechanisms that influence the distribution of melt within a viscously deformable partially molten rock. Three mechanisms are considered, either alone or in various combinations. (1) An applied shear stress causes melt to align and <b>segregate</b> into melt-rich <b>bands</b> with a consistent geometrical relationship to the shear geometry. In Chapter 2, we investigate possible means of scaling the bands that form in experimental samples to Earth's mantle and explore the evolution of melt-rich bands at high shear strain. (2) Interfacial tension driven flow acts to homogenize the distribution of melt within a partially molten sample. In Chapter 3, we investigate the evolution of melt distribution during static annealing of a sample containing melt-rich bands. We compare the experimental results with models of interfacial tension driven flow to determine which mechanisms control the rate of melt redistribution. (3) A melt source that is undersaturated in some component, when coupled with a sink that is rich in that component, will infiltrate into the sink through reactive flow. This reactive flow can develop into an instability in which fingers of high melt fraction propagate into the sink. In Chapter 4 we investigate this process both under static conditions and in combination with stress-driven melt segregation...|$|R
