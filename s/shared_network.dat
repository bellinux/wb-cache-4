For example, the [...] command starts a remote session on a compute server.

In particular we extend work of Reed & Zwart on fluid models of bandwidth sharing with rate constraints under Markovian assumptions: we consider a bandwidth <b>sharing</b> <b>network</b> with rate constraints, where job sizes and deadlines have a general joint distribution. We introduce a fluid model and investi-gate several of its properties.

While {{unauthorized}} copies of movies have been distributed via portable physical media for some time, low-cost, high-bandwidth Internet connections and peer-topeer file <b>sharing</b> <b>networks</b> provide highly efficient distribution media. Many movies are showing up on file <b>sharing</b> <b>networks</b> shortly after, and in some cases prior to, theatrical release. It has been argued that the availability of unauthorized copies directly affects theater attendance and DVD sales, and hence represents a major financial threat to the movie industry. Our research attempts to determine the source of unauthorized copies by studying the availability and characteristics of recent popular movies in file <b>sharing</b> <b>networks.</b> We developed a data set of 312 popular movies and located one or more samples of 183 of these movies on file <b>sharing</b> <b>networks,</b> for a total of 285 movie samples. 77 % of these samples appear to have been leaked by industry insiders. Most of our samples appeared on file <b>sharing</b> <b>networks</b> prior to their official consumer DVD release date. Indeed, of the movies that had been released on DVD as of the time of our study, only 5 % first appeared after their DVD release date on a web site that indexes file <b>sharing</b> <b>networks,</b> indicating that consumer DVD copying currently represents a relatively minor factor compared with insider leaks. We perform a brief analysis of the movie production and distribution process and identify potential security vulnerabilities that may lead to unauthorized copies becom...|$|R
