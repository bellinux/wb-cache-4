Number of driving waves varied step displacement readily, and decrease of driving waves brought about 2 nm step motion as a minimum step of an experimental setup. We proposed a simulation model {{so as to}} control step displacement at open loop condition. The simulation model represented the characteristic transient response of the <b>surface</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> motor, {{and it can be}} applied to an open loop control of a rigid structural <b>surface</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> motor.
