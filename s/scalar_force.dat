40|$|Theories {{that attempt}} to explain cosmic {{acceleration}} by modifying gravity typically introduces a long-range <b>scalar</b> <b>force</b> {{that needs to be}} screened on small scales. One common screening mechanism is the chameleon, where the <b>scalar</b> <b>force</b> is screened in environments with a sufficiently deep gravitational potential, but acts unimpeded in regions with a shallow gravitational potential. This leads to a variation in the overall gravitational G with environment. We show such a variation can occur within a star itself, significantly affecting its evolution and structure, provided that the host galaxy is unscreened. The effect is most pronounced for red giants, which would be smaller by a factor of tens of percent and thus hotter by 100 's of K, depending on the parameters of the underlying scalar-tensor theory. Careful measurements of these stars in suitable environments (nearby dwarf galaxies not associated with groups or clusters) would provide constraints on the chameleon mechanism that are four orders of magnitude better than current large scale structure limits, and two orders of magnitude better than present solar system tests.

In this work, a new <b>scalar</b> field <b>forcing</b> technique, termed “linear scalar forcing,” is presented and evaluated for passive scalars. It is compared to both the well-known mean <b>scalar</b> gradient <b>forcing</b> technique and a low waveshell spectral forcing technique.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} exploration of dark energy and modified gravity models containing a single scalar field non-minimally coupled to the metric. Even though the parameter space is large, by exploiting an {{effective field theory}} (EFT) formulation and by imposing simple physical constraints such as stability conditions and (sub-) luminal propagation of perturbations, we arrive {{at a number of}} generic predictions. (1) The linear growth rate of matter density fluctuations is generally suppressed compared to ΛCDM at intermediate redshifts (0. 5 ≲ z ≲ 1), despite the introduction of an attractive long-range <b>scalar</b> <b>force.</b> This {{is due to the fact}} that, in self-accelerating models, the background gravitational coupling weakens at intermediate redshifts, over-compensating the effect of the attractive <b>scalar</b> <b>force.</b> (2) At higher redshifts, the opposite happens; we identify a period of super-growth when the linear growth rate is larger than that predicted by ΛCDM. (3) The gravitational slip parameter η - the ratio of the space part of the metric perturbation to the time part - is bounded from above. For Brans-Dicke-type theories η is at most unity. For more general theories, η can exceed unity at intermediate redshifts, but not more than about 1. 5 if, at the same time, the linear growth rate is to be compatible with current observational constraints. We caution against phenomenological parametrization of data that do not correspond to predictions from viable physical theories.

40|$|Modified gravity {{theories}} {{capable of}} genuine self-acceleration typically invoke a galileon scalar which mediates a long range force, but is screened by the Vainshtein mechanism on small scales.

Thus, for a galaxy free-falling in some external gravitational field, its central massive black hole {{is expected to}} lag behind the stars. To look for this effect, and to distinguish it from other astrophysical effects, one can correlate the gravitational pull from the surrounding structure with the offset between the stellar center and the black hole.

Here we explore the dynamics of the Vainshtein screening mechanism, focusing on the decoupling limit of the DGP braneworld scenario and dRGT massive gravity. We show that there is a vast set of initial conditions whose evolution is well defined and which are driven to the static, screening solutions of these theories. Screening solutions are stable and behave coherently under small fluctuations: they oscillate and eventually settle to an equilibrium configuration, the timescale for the oscillations and damping being dictated by the Vainshtein radius of the screening solutions. At very late times, a power-law decay ensues, in agreement with known analytical results. However, we also conjecture that physically interesting processes such as gravitational collapse of compact stars may not possess a well-posed initial value problem. Finally, we construct solutions with nontrivial multipolar structure describing the screening field of deformed, asymmetric bodies and show that higher multipoles are screened more efficiently than the monopole component.
