50|$|Primary token: Primary tokens {{can only}} be {{associated}} to processes, and they represent a process's <b>security</b> <b>subject.</b> The creation of primary tokens and their association to processes are both privileged operations, requiring two different privileges {{in the name of}} privilege separation - the typical scenario sees the authentication service creating the token, and a logon service associating it to the user's operating system shell.

50|$|VAST is {{an acronym}} for Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat modeling. The {{underlying}} principle of this methodology is the necessity of scaling the threat modeling process across the infrastructure and entire SDLC, and integrating it seamlessly into an Agile software development methodology. The methodology seeks to provide actionable outputs for {{the unique needs of}} various stakeholders: application architects and developers, cybersecurity personnel, and senior executives. The methodology provides a unique application and infrastructure visualization scheme such that the creation and use of threat models do not require specific <b>security</b> <b>subject</b> matter expertise.|$|E
50|$|The Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) is a seven-step, risk-centric methodology. It {{provides}} a seven-step process for aligning business objectives and technical requirements, {{taking into account}} compliance issues and business analysis. The intent of the method {{is to provide a}} dynamic threat identification, enumeration, and scoring process. Once the threat model is completed <b>security</b> <b>subject</b> matter experts develop a detailed analysis of the identified threats. Finally, appropriate security controls can be enumerated. This methodology is intended to provide an attacker-centric view of the application and infrastructure from which defenders can develop an asset-centric mitigation strategy.|$|E

As a result, customers of international organizations such as Amazon and eBay in the EU have the ability to review and delete information, while Americans do not.

Using Mark Duffield’s distinction between the insured Global North and the non-insured Global South, this paper discusses how drones generate a radical dissociation between the intervener and the intervened that ultimately produces new security environments at the margins of the international system. These new security environments are defined by the articulation between space, technologies and bodies: bodies of invisible subjects; bodies that are uninsurable...|$|R

5000|$|Impersonation token: Impersonation is a {{security}} concept implemented in Windows NT {{that allows a}} server application to temporarily [...] "be" [...] the client in terms of access to secure objects. Impersonation has four possible levels: anonymous, giving the server the access of an anonymous/unidentified user, identification, letting the server inspect the client's identity but not use that identity to access objects, impersonation, letting the server act {{on behalf of the}} client, and delegation, same as impersonation but extended to remote systems to which the server connects (through the preservation of credentials). The client can choose the maximum impersonation level (if any) available to the server as a connection parameter. Delegation and impersonation are privileged operations (impersonation initially was not, but historical carelessness in the implementation of client APIs failing to restrict the default level to [...] "identification", letting an unprivileged server impersonate an unwilling privileged client, called for it). Impersonation tokens can only be associated to threads, and they represent a client process's <b>security</b> <b>subject.</b> Impersonation tokens are usually created and associated to the current thread implicitly, by IPC mechanisms such as DCE RPC, DDE and named pipes.|$|E

We show that the future cash flows of a <b>security</b> <b>subject</b> to price limit regulation resemble that of a distinctive contingent claim. Assuming that the security price follows a lognormal distribution, we use the risk-neutral valuation relation (RNVR) developed by [4] to derive the security valuation, {{in the presence of}} price fluctuation limits. The characteristics of the pricing formula are examined analytically and numerically. Contingent claims, price limits, risk neutral valuation, security pricing...|$|E
