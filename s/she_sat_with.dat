25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Milano {{contacted}} Ryan White, a schoolboy ostracized for having AIDS, and {{a fan of}} Milano's. She attended a big party for him where <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> him for six hours making friendship bracelets. They appeared together on The Phil Donahue Show, where Milano kissed White, {{in order to show}} that she could not catch the disease through casual contact with him.|$|E
60|$|The {{woman did}} not answer; <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> her black eyes intently {{fixed on the}} floor.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> {{her face}} averted, {{and did not}} answer. His heart struck heavily, {{but he did not}} relax.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>with</b> {{her back}} towards Mr. Carter {{and looked out}} at the window.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>with</b> a start, {{her eyes}} {{questioning}} his, the breath coming quickly through her parted lips.|$|R
60|$|He {{quoted the}} last word satirically against her. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> convulsed <b>with</b> fury and violation, speechless, like a {{stricken}} pythoness of the Greek oracle.|$|R
60|$|Phoebe trembled, {{and said}} nothing. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> her head down, and her hands, fast clasped together, {{resting on her}} lap.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Byron abdicated her {{dominion}} {{there and}} then forever. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> quite a mild expression for some time in silence. Then she said, ...|$|E
60|$|When dark {{fell and}} the deep rumble of the surf filled the air, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> her father in a quiet corner of the garden.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>with</b> a stifled cry. It {{seemed as}} if {{a flash of light}} had been turned upon her, almost {{blinding}} her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> motionless, <b>with</b> {{her hand}} {{tightening}} {{over the edge}} of the table, and he, too, said no more. She began to tremble violently.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>with</b> a gasp, {{and young}} Kitsong stared. Their {{surprise}} was too genuine to be assumed. [...] "What's that you say? Watson killed?" ...|$|R
60|$|Anne made no answer. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> her clasped {{hands on}} her lap. Her eyes looked uneasily away from Sir Patrick's face, for the first time.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} that the journey is forced upon me," [...] {{she said to}} Arthur, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> her bonnet on, waiting for the vehicle.|$|E
60|$|As <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> the babe {{in her lap}} {{looking over}} the {{familiar}} hills, she was more beautiful {{than she had ever}} been before. She was a being glorified.|$|E
60|$|The simple {{kindness}} {{of her words}} fell clearly. Wing went out from her presence as one entrusted with a grave commission. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> on <b>with</b> her thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> up, <b>with</b> {{a little}} yawn. [...] "Let down the windows, please," [...] she said. [...] "We {{will have some}} fresh air in for a few minutes." ...|$|R
60|$|Rob {{thought she}} was yery {{handsome}} as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> there <b>with</b> her {{eyes fixed on the}} horizon, while these rebellious thoughts found utterance in her quivering, passionate voice.|$|R
60|$|He {{stumbled}} away very obediently, presently {{returning with}} a pad, which she singed before the fire, then {{put on her}} forehead, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> the baby on her lap.|$|E
6000|$|... "A wiser man {{he could}} not have called on to a {{difficult}} case," [...] added Mrs. Gray, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> her work at a little distance from the table.|$|E
60|$|And Alvina {{could feel}} waves of black envy go out against Pancrazio, {{because she was}} {{domiciled}} with him, and because <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> him in the flat cart, driving to Ossona.|$|E
60|$|When he was gone, Fan's song ended as {{suddenly}} as it began, and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> thinking, <b>with</b> varying expressions of doubt and trouble passing rapidly across her face.|$|R
50|$|Guston {{posed for}} her husband {{throughout}} his career for various works, including a 1944 painting entitled The Young Mother, for which <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> along <b>with</b> their daughter, also named Musa.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, how kind of you," [...] said Flora to her father, when <b>she</b> {{afterwards}} <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> {{him alone}} in this boudoir, and looked round on everything with the deepest interest.|$|R
60|$|For a {{few minutes}} that seemed hours to the frightened girl, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> tense nerves waiting for the spring of the {{crouching}} thing that was to end her misery of apprehension.|$|E
60|$|The Empress Catharine saw {{the show}} from an {{elevation}} on the shore, where <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> {{the ladies of}} her court in a pavilion or tent which had been erected for the purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{never was}} any thing so lovely!" [...] cried Daisy, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> the three downy balls in her lap, while the mamma gratefully lapped the new milk from Aunt Wee's cup.|$|E
6000|$|... "The lovely Crinoline {{was sitting}} {{alone at a}} lattice window on a summer morning, and as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>she</b> sang <b>with</b> melancholy cadence {{the first part of}} the now celebrated song which had then lately appeared, from the {{distinguished}} pen of Sir G-- H--," ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{woman could}} do better," [...] she {{answered}} gravely. [...] "I should {{like you to}} talk it over, David, if you begin at the beginning"; and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>with</b> her hands crossed.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> {{down again}} <b>with</b> {{the air of}} a woman who had said her last word.|$|R
60|$|The man {{and woman}} were both gray. He lay staring at the sky. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> somber {{eyes fixed on the}} distant sea, whose {{crawling}} lines glittered in ever-changing designs on its purple sweep.|$|E
60|$|In {{the train}} {{on the way}} down, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> closed eyes, {{in a sort of}} trance. If her lover had been there holding her in his arms, he could not have seemed nearer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I had {{answered}} your Grace on that question." [...] Then {{she put down}} the grapes, and moved herself on her chair, so that <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> her face turned away from him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought--" [...] she began. He {{had told}} her he had a good bit of money left over. But she {{realised}} it was no use asking questions. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> rigid <b>with</b> bitterness and indignation.|$|R
6000|$|When she had {{finished}} and sealed the letter, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> motionless <b>with</b> a numb feeling in hands and brain, trying to realize what she had next to do. To go, and that was all! ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{came back}} to me--I had not thought <b>she</b> would. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>with</b> her {{embroidery}} in her lap, and for some moments busied herself with it in silence. Then she said, without looking up:-- ...|$|R
