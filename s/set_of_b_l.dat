40|$|The Discrete Global Grid Systems (or {{the global}} {{position}} location framework) {{is a kind}} of scientific and concise spatial reference system, which is the discretization, accurate and systematic representation of the earth information data. In recent years, with the development of GPS and Beidou satellite system and the process of globalization, the global metric and accuracy of spatial analysis should be pay more attention by people. In this paper, first, for the progress and insufficiency over recent years of the earth grid research, the author discusses several quantity issues include:the integrity of meshing, logical consistency, and some related problems. Then regarding the questions of position and metric, the author points out that the Earth is the target object of meshing its characteristics of metric space. The revolutionary demand of " 3 D structure and centimeter level accuracy" will {{have a significant impact on}} global GIS system. Next, the 3 D meshing approaches to the ellipsoid of the earth are stressed, and the author also introduces the corresponding experiments and theoretical approach in map algebra on the 3 D earth meshing. Finally, this paper reaffirms that the 3 <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> (<b>B,</b> <b>L,</b> H) orthogonal surface should be the most appropriate way on metric for the Earth meshing...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the logic {{contained in the}} draft Z standard is inconsistent. 1. Introduction The specification language Z has been very widely used and commended, {{but it has not}} yet received the kind of mathematical attention one would hope for a formal method. Despite {{more than a decade of}} effort, the standard source for the formalisation of Z [Nic 95] still contains many unclarities and incompletenesses. Worse, as this short note demonstrates, the proposed logic it contains is inconsistent. 2. The inconsistency proof Firstly, the rule (BindSel) enables us to obtain the usual closure axiom for bindings. Suppose the alphabet <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>b</b> is fΔΔΔ <b>l</b> i ΔΔ. Then we have: ΔΔΔ b:l i = b:l i ΔΔΔΔΔΔ b:l i = b:l i ΔΔΔ b = hj ΔΔΔ l i V b:l i ΔΔΔ ji Secondly, we may use this closure axiom to obtain more natural equality congruence rules for binding projecti [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Let SL 4 (Z) be {{the group}} of four by four {{integral}} matrices with determinant one. This group acts upon the top homology of the spherical Tits building of SL 4 over Q, i. e. the Steinberg module St 4 (see below, 1. 2). The goal of this note is to prove the following Theorem 1. The first homology group H 1 (SL 4 (Z), St 4) is a finite group of order a power of 2. This result was proved eighteen years ago [S]. At the time, I deduced from it that K 4 (Z) is the direct sum of a finite 2 -group and 0 or Z/ 3. In [R], Rognes uses Theorem 1 in his proof that K 4 (Z) vanishes. I thank J. Rognes for telling me to write this paper, and for useful comments, and K. Brown for his help. 1. Voronoi’s reduction theory 1. 1. Let n ≥ 2 be an integer, let Vn be the vector space of n by n real symmetric matrices, and let Cn ⊂ Vn be the open cone of all positive definite symmetric matrices. The group R+ of positive real numbers acts on Cn by multiplication, and the quotient Xn = Cn/R+ is the symmetric space of SLn(R). A matrix A in Vn {{is said to have}} rational nullspace when the nullspace Ker(A) of the bilinear form defined by A is spanned by vectors in Q n ⊂ R n. We let C ∗ n be the subset of Vn consisting of all nonzero positive semi-definite symmetric matrices with rational nullspace, X ∗ n = C ∗ n /R+ and π: C ∗ n → X ∗ n be the projection map. The group GLn(Z) acts upon C ∗ n on the right by the formula A · g = g t A g, g ∈ GLn(Z), A ∈ C ∗ n, and Cn is invariant under this action. Given A in Cn we let µ(A) be the minimum value <b>of</b> the number <b>b</b> t A b where b ranges over all nonzero vectors in the lattice L = Z n ⊂ R n, and m(A) be the (finite) <b>set</b> <b>of</b> vectors <b>b</b> ∈ <b>L</b> − { 0 } such that b t A b = µ(A), i. e. the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> minimal vectors.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of rapid fermion-number violation due to nonperturbative electroweak effects certain relations between the baryon number of the Universe and the lepton numbers of the Universe are predicted. In some cases the electron-neutrino asymmetry is exactly specified {{in terms of the}} baryon asymmetry. Without introducing new particles, beyond the usual quarks and leptons, it is necessary that the Universe possess a nonzero value <b>of</b> <b>B</b> - <b>L</b> prior to the epoch of fermion-number violation if baryon and lepton asymmetries are to survive. Contrary to intuition, even though electroweak processes violate <b>B</b> + <b>L,</b> a nonzero value <b>of</b> <b>B</b> + <b>L</b> persists after the epoch of rapid fermion-number violation. If the standard model is extended to include lepton-number violation, for example through Majorana neutrino masses, then electroweak processes will reduce the baryon number to zero even in {{the presence}} <b>of</b> an initial <b>B</b> - <b>L</b> unless 20 M(sub L) approximately greater than the square root <b>of</b> (T(sub <b>B</b> - <b>L)</b> m(sub P 1)) where M(sub L) <b>sets</b> the scale <b>of</b> lepton number violation and T(sub <b>B</b> - <b>L)</b> is the temperature at which a <b>B</b> - <b>L</b> asymmetry is produced.

40|$|In the climate-carbon cycle system, the {{terrestrial}} ecosystem feedback is significant. In studies on feedback analysis, the ecosystem feedback {{is divided into}} the sensitivity of carbon storage to atmospheric CO 2 concentration (<b>b</b> <b>L),</b> and temperature change (g L). Although ecosystems include many nonlinear processes, the scenario- and time-dependency <b>of</b> <b>b</b> <b>L</b> and g L have not been explicitly discussed. To check the validity of this simplification and its robustness, we carried out two, 1 % per year (p. a.) increase and RCP 4. 5 scenario, experiments, using a processbased terrestrial ecosystem model forced by an existing GCM output, combined with an energy moisture balance model for the latter experiment, with 300 ensemble members perturbing twelve important and a priori unconstrained parameters. In the 1 % p. a. experiment, <b>b</b> <b>L</b> peaked around 500 ppm and then gradually decreased with increasing CO 2 level, while g L decreased with some inter-annual variability as temperature increases. The time-dependency <b>of</b> <b>b</b> <b>L</b> was small (at least for CO 2 level> 550 ppm), but that of g L was significant, and the e¤ect of this was larger {{than that of the}} nonlinear term (i. e., combined e¤ect of CO 2 and temperature change). The scenario-dependency is also significant, but the e¤ect in the estimated carbon uptake was smaller than that by the time-dependency.
