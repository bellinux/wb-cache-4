40|$|Background/Aim. The {{relationship}} between alcoholism and depression is observed in clinical trials. The factors which could predict persistence of <b>secondary</b> <b>depression</b> after alcohol withdrawal {{are not enough}} explored on admission. The differences between depressed (DA) and non-depressed (NDA) alcoholics regarding the degrees of severity of withdrawal, severity of depression {{and the intensity of}} cognitive dysfunctions were explored on admission to investigate possibility of prediction of the development of <b>secondary</b> <b>depression</b> in alcoholics. Methods. A group of primary male alcoholics (n= 86) was recruited during inpatient treatment. After 4 weeks alcoholics were divided in the DA group (n= 43) and NDA (n= 43) group according to the score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Clinical assessment of withdrawal, scoring on the Alcohol Dependency Severity Scale- ASD, and scoring on the Mini Mental Scale-MMSE were performed in all the participants on admission. The differences between the groups were tested by the Student's t-test. Results. The DA group showed the significantly higher severity of depression, higher levels of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and cognitive dysfunctions than the NDA group on admission. Conclusion. The specific group of depressive alcoholics was shown to be characterized by the higher severity of alcoholism and depression on admission, which could predict prolonged, <b>secondary</b> <b>depression.</b> Early detection and concurrent therapy of <b>secondary</b> <b>depression</b> could improve the treatment, and reduce the relapse of alcoholism...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{progress}} of positron emission tomography (PET) {{as a tool for}} understanding the psychobiology of mood disorders, particularly major depression and bipolar disorder. Method: Review of the literature on functional imaging of mood disorders. Results: Functional imaging techniques have been used in psychiatric research as a noninvasive method to study the behaviour and function of the brain. Techniques used so far have involved the manipulation of emotion in healthy volunteers, the evaluation of depressed (unipolar and bipolar as well as <b>secondary</b> <b>depression),</b> manic, and normal subjects under resting and various activation conditions, such as cognitive activation, acute pharmacological challenge, and chronic thymoleptic treatments. As a result, functional imaging studies tend to support abnormalities in specific frontal and limbic regions. Conclusion: Different PET methods demonstrate consistent abnormalities in the prefrontal, cingulate, and amygdala regions. These findings are in agreement with past animal and clinical anatomical correlates of mood and emotions.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a ‘secondary deflation’ was {{developed}} in the 1930 s by the German economist Wilhelm Röpke, who saw it as something different from a normal depression. While a primary deflation is a necessary reaction to the inflation from a boom period, a secondary deflation is independent and economically purposeless. Röpke argued that <b>secondary</b> <b>depressions</b> occurred in the US, Germany, France and Switzerland during the 1930 s, but was vague on what made them follow primary depressions. Recently, the Taiwanese–American economist Richard C. Koo has claimed to have discovered the ‘Holy Grail of macroeconomics’, that is, what made the Great Depression so deep and long. During the Great Depression, the bursting of the asset price bubble resulted in private sectors having more debt than assets; as they shifted from maximising profits to minimising debt, the consequent debt deflation shrank the economy. According to Koo, Western economies today are suffering from a similar ‘balance sheet recession’. Strengthened by the notion of a balance sheet recession, Röpke's long-lost insights might advance our understanding of the business cycle in general and the present crisis in the US and the Eurozone in particular...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{pathophysiology}} {{of depression}} {{is not fully}} understood in either primary depression (i. e., no known neuropathology related to depression) or <b>secondary</b> <b>depression</b> (i. e., neuropathologic disorder that leads to depres-sion), {{a number of studies}} have begun to identify aspects of the pathophysiology of both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>depression.</b> This article reviews the findings of studies examining the pathophysiology of depression following stroke, Parkinson’s disease, or Huntington’s disease and compares them to findings in primary depression. Studies exam-ining glucose metabolic rates or blood flow changes in regional brain areas found that stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease, as well as primary depression, were all associated with decreased activity or brain lesions in the orbital frontal cortex and basal ganglia. There were also abnormalities noted in the basal temporal lobes, cingulate cortex, and thalamus in some but not all disorders. Studies in stroke have also noted depletions of sero-tonin receptors in left temporal cortex associated with depression. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of secondary and primary depression involves the dysfunction of one or more of the corti-cal-basal ganglia-thalamic neuronal loops. This dysfunction may be mediated by decreased serotonin release. These studies may ultimately lead to more focused and specific treatments. (J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol 1999; 12 : 128 - 136) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Functional brain imaging {{studies in}} unipo-lar and <b>secondary</b> <b>depression</b> have {{generally}} found de-creased prefrontal cortical activity, but in bipolar disor-ders {{findings have been}} more variable. Methods: Forty-three medication-free, treatment-resistant, predominantly rapid-cycling bipolar disorder patients and 43 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects had cerebral glucose metabolism assessed using positron emis-sion tomography and fluorine- 18 -deoxyglucose. Results: Depressed bipolar disorder patients compared to control subjects had decreased global, absolute prefrontal and anterior paralimbic cortical, and increased normal-ized subcortical (ventral striatum, thalamus, right amyg-dala) metabolism. Degree of depression correlated nega-tively with absolute prefrontal and paralimbic cortical, and positively with normalized anterior paralimbic sub-cortical metabolism. Increased normalized cerebello-pos-terior cortical metabolism was seen in all patient sub-groups compared to control subjects, independent of mood state, disorder subtype, or cycle frequency. Conclusions: In bipolar depression, we observed a pat-tern of prefrontal hypometabolism, consistent with obser-vations in primary unipolar and <b>secondary</b> <b>depression,</b> suggesting {{this is part of}} a common neural substrate for depression independent of etiology.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{pharmacological}} and psychological treatment of both primary insomnia and insomnia <b>secondary</b> to <b>depression.</b> The first study, {{in a double}} blind placebo controlled trial, compares the effects of two anti-depressants, nefazodone and paroxetine, on the sleep of patients with moderate to severe depression. The second study described is a cross over trial that investigates whether nefazodone compared to placebo has beneficial effects on sleep in patients with primary insomnia. The final chapter explores the treatment of primary insomnia or secondary insomnia (e. g. insomnia <b>secondary</b> to <b>depression)</b> using a cognitive behaviour therapy group approach. In the first study, nefazodone was found, compared to paroxetine, to increase sleep efficiency, total sleep time and decrease number of awakenings as measured objectively by polysomnography. These effects were evident early in treatment, by day 3. In the second study nefazodone was not found, compared to placebo, to increase sleep efficiency, total sleep time or decrease number of awakenings in patients with primary insomnia. In the third study, patients with primary insomnia did report improvements in dysfunctional attitudes and beliefs about insomnia and improvements in energy/vitality and mental health, {{as measured by the}} SF 36 quality of life scale, after attending group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

40|$|Abstract Background A better {{understanding}} is needed of factors behind the long-term outcome of dysthymic and panic disorders. Combining patients' perceptions {{of factors that}} help and hind remission with objective assessments of outcome may give greater insight into mechanisms for maintaining recovery. Methods Twenty-three dysthymic and 15 panic disorder patients participated in a 9 -year follow-up investigation of a naturalistic study with psychotherapy and antidepressants. Degree of remission was determined by reassessments with SCID-I & II interviews, self-reported symptoms and life-charting (aided by case records). Qualitative content analysis of in-depth interviews with all 38 patients was done to examine the phenomenon of enduring remission by exploring: 1) perceived helpful and hindering factors, 2) factors common to and specific for the diagnostic groups, 3) convergence between patients' subjective views on remission with objective diagnostic assessments. Results About 50 % of the patients were in full or partial remission. Subjective and objective views on degree of remission generally converged, and remission was perceived as receiving 'Tools to handle life'. Common helpful factors were self-understanding, enhanced flexibility of thinking, and antidepressant medication, as well as confidence in the therapist and social support. The perceived main obstacle was difficulty in negotiating treatments. Remitted had overcome the obstacles, whereas many non-remitted had problems expressing their needs. Patients with dysthymia and panic disorder described specific helpful relationships with the therapist: 'As a parent' versus 'As a coach', and specific central areas for change: self-acceptance and resolution of relational problems versus awareness and handling of feelings. Conclusion A general model for recovery from dysthymic and panic disorders is proposed, involving: 1) understanding self and illness mechanisms, 2) enhanced flexibility of thinking, and 3) change from avoidance coping to approach coping; and recognising that a vehicle for this change is a helpful relationship {{to the health care}} provider. The perceived needs of specific treatment ingredients suggest that it is essential to differentiate between early-onset dysthymia and <b>secondary</b> <b>depressions.</b> The perceived access problems will be further investigated. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Existing {{research}} suggests that the rate of depressive illness and depressive symptoms are high in people living with HIV/AIDS, but investigations on the causes of depression provide conflicting results. Social, psychological and biological factors have all been suggested as possible causes of depression in people living with HIV/AIDS. The suggestion that depression {{may be the result of}} the neurotropic effects of the virus on the central nervous system leading to an 'organic' or <b>secondary</b> <b>depression</b> has major implications in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. The aim of the current study was to further investigate the nature and underlying aetiology of depression in people living with HIV/AIDS. Method: One hundred and twenty-nine people living with HIV/AIDS recruited for the study from outpatients clinics and primary care settings completed a range of self-report symptom measures including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), SF- 36, SPHERE and a personality measure, the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI). They also completed a battery of neuropsychological tests (CANTAB) and a structured clinical interview (SCID-DSM-IV). Medical and sociodemographic data were also recorded. Results: Approximately one-third scored &# 8805; 14 on the BDI and 27 % met criteria for a current 'mood disorder' on the SCID. Depressive symptoms were strongly related to personality style, having a past psychiatric history and current stressful psychosocial situation. There was no association between depression and HIV disease status. There was no evidence in this study cohort of a distinct subtype of 'organic' or <b>secondary</b> <b>depression.</b> Conclusions: These results suggest that at least for 'well' people living with HIV/AIDS, there is no distinct subtype of depression and early treatment approaches can be modelled on those used for other non-HIV groups.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{different}} views {{on the origins of}} gas reservoirs of Ordovician Majiagou Fm in the Ordos Basin, but none of them supports the opinion that there are scale source rocks (TOC> 0. 5 %) in the Majiagou Fm. In this paper, a series of analysis was made on cores and cutting samples taken from recent newly-drilled wells in the Ordovician reservoirs in the central–eastern areas of the Ordos Basin. Accordingly, the organic abundance features of different types of source rocks in the Majiagou Fm were presented, and for the first time, it was discovered and verified that there are effective scale source rocks with high organic abundance. Based on these analysis and studies, the following results were achieved. First, the effective source rocks of Majiagou Fm are composed of thin–thick layered dark dolomite-bearing mudstones, dolomitic mudstones and argillaceous dolomites, and their enrichment and distribution are obviously controlled by sedimentary facies. During the sedimentation of Majiagou Fm, the effective scale source rocks developed better at the regressive stage than at the transgressive stage. The effective source rocks are primarily distributed in the upper part of Ma 5 Member (especially concentrated in the third and fourth sub-members) and secondly in Ma 3 Member, Ma 1 Member and the middle–lower part of Ma 5 Member. Second, the effective source rocks are areally distributed in a dual-girdle form around the Mizhi Salt Depression, and those in the <b>secondary</b> <b>depressions</b> are medium–thick layered, with a large total thickness and high organic abundance. Third, the effective source rocks in the center of Mizhi <b>Depression</b> and the <b>secondary</b> uplifts are thin-layered, with a small total thickness and low organic abundance. And fourth, the organic abundance of the effective source rocks varies from 0. 30 % to 8. 45 %. Phytoplankton and Acritarchs are the main parent materials of hydrocarbon, and organic matters are of sapropel or sapropel prone type. To sum up, the Ordovician effective source rocks in the Ordos Basin are generally at an over-mature stage and they contribute greatly to the natural gas in the Majiagou Fm.
