50|$|Engines in {{hydraulic}} excavators {{usually just}} drive hydraulic pumps; {{there are usually}} 3 pumps: the two main pumps are for supplying oil at high pressure (up to 5000 psi) for the arms, <b>swing</b> <b>motor,</b> track motors, and accessories, {{and the third is}} a lower pressure (~700 psi) pump for Pilot Control, this circuit used for the control of the spool valves, this allows for a reduced effort required when operating the controls. Generally, the 3 pumps used in excavators consist of 2 Variable displacement piston pumps and a Gear pump. The alignment of the pumps in the excavator unit changes with different manufacturers using different formats.|$|E

This paper put forward a welding torch swing control system based on the DSP chip TMS 320 LF 2407 A, and described its structure, working principle, software implementation and anti-interference design. The control system could realize the swing welding methods set by control panel, control the running motor and <b>swing</b> <b>motor</b> motion, and could realize arbitrary adjustment of the welding torch swing parameters such as speed, amplitude and lag time. On site operation shows that the system is stable, high reliable and meets the demands of industrial field...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{interest}} in unmanned excavator is growing {{more and more}} {{for the sake of}} work efficiency and safety of the operator. It is general understanding that an optimal working path planning and inverse dynamic control should be resolved first for the realization of the unmanned excavator. In this paper, the methods to determine the optimal working path based on minimum torque or time and to simulate digging works tracking on the designed working path are proposed. In case of the minimum torque, the optimal working path is determined to minimize the joint torques of attachments. On the other hand, in case of minimum time, the optimal working path is decided to minimize time duration for one-cycle working considering the hydraulic constraints such as oil flow rate and relief pressure etc. In order to verify the inverse dynamic code used in the optimization and the optimized path, field measurements were carried out for the various parameters such as swing angle, cylinder lengths, and pressures of a <b>swing</b> <b>motor</b> and hydraulic cylinders during digging works. The modified FEE(Fundamental Earthmoving Equation) is adopted for the modeling of soil-tool interaction in digging process and the inverse dynamics with external force such as constant and reducing lifting weights is used in lifting and dumping process. Finally, all the simulated data were compared with the measured data in order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed methods in view of the development of the unmanned excavator...|$|E

40|$|The walking {{coordination}} and motor output of intact adult stick insects was examined {{when they were}} supported above an oiled glass surface. The viscosity of the silicone oil was adjusted so that the animal walked with either tripod or slow-walk coordination. In the absence of mechanical coupling through the substrate, the legs typically moved at different speeds in retrac-tion. If these differences were not too large the walks were well-coordinated in the transitions from stance to <b>swing</b> phase. <b>Motor</b> output was variable and sometimes showed periods of very weak activity in depressors and retrac-tors. Under these conditions an individual leg moved much more slowly than its neighbours, producing 2 : 1 coordination patterns...|$|R

It was to be called [...] "Super Single" [...] but later the proposed name was changed to Formula 450, or F450. Trippe had been lobbying for {{the creation of a}} Formula 450 class because it would be more affordable to rookie and under-21-year-old riders, compared to 600 cc supersport sport bike racing. He said, [...] "Formula 450 is a great way to encourage young riders.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{longitudinal}} change in gait and motor function in pre-manifest Huntington’s disease (HD). We examined ten pre-manifest subjects at baseline, one and five years. Quantitative gait data were collected with an electronic mat (GAITRite®). We analyzed measures related to speed (velocity, step length, cadence), asymmetry (step length difference), dynamic balance (percent time in double support, support base) and variability in stride length and <b>swing</b> time. <b>Motor</b> function was assessed with the motor component of the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale. Gait velocity decreased (p= 0. 001), whereas step length difference (p= 0. 006), stride length variability (p= 0. 0001) and swing time variability increased (p= 0. 0001) from baseline to year five. Step length difference (p< 0. 05) and swing time variability (p< 0. 05) increased marginally in one year from baseline. UHDRS Total motor score increased over five years (p= 0. 003), though the increase in one year was not significant (p= 0. 053). Of the individual motor domain scores (eye, hand movements, gait and balance, chorea) only dystonia worsened over five years (p= 0. 02). Total motor scor...|$|R
40|$|In the 1970 s {{the sugar}} {{industry}} began {{moving away from}} steam turbine driven shredders in favour of electric motor drives. Due to the high inertias of the shredders, long starting times and high starting torque requirements, the preferred electric motor drives have been slip ring motors with liquid starters. With the demand for higher Preparation Indices the shredder motor powers gradually increased. These ever-larger motors together with the power swings generally associated with shredders began to impact negatively on the sugar mill power houses and {{had the potential to}} cause loss of synchronism of the TAs and factory blackouts. The accepted solution was to engineer an increase in the rotor resistance and thus motor slip in order to relieve the stress on the power supply of the large power <b>swings.</b> Increasing <b>motor</b> slip is easily carried out with slip ring motors and external wire wound resistances left in the rotor circuit during normal running. This solution has been the standard adopted in virtually all new southern African mills from then to the present day. Pressure is being brought to bear by the large motor manufacturers in that slip ring motors and liquid starter applications are falling out of favour and being replaced with reliable, medium voltage, variable speed drives connected to robust, simple and low maintenance squirrel cage motors. The sugar industry needs to keep up with this technology and take advantage of less expensive, more reliable shredder drive designs...|$|R
40|$|Dragline {{productivity}} is {{strongly influenced by}} swing cycle times, comprising between 60 – 70 % of all dragline operational time. The ability to classify and report on dragline swing cycles according to their limiting motion is essential for identifying performance losses and deriving continuous improvements. This paper presents an algorithm for the automatic classification of dragline cycle dependencies. The algorithm adopts a simple graphical approach, based on coincident limits defined by the locus of points where the <b>swing</b> and hoist <b>motors</b> work at full capacity for equivalent time periods. The algorithm is capable of distinguishing three cycle dependencies; swing, hoist, and drag limited cycles. The coincident limit algorithm was applied on a dragline at a coal mine in Queensland’s Bowen Basin. A data set of 200 000 cycles consisted of: 70 % swing limited cycles; 27 % hoist limited cycles and 3 % drag limited cycles. The coincident limit algorithm permits an equivalent swing angle to be calculated for draglines in hoist limited situations. This facilitates the possibility of measuring dragline work as BCMs multiplied by the equivalent swing angle. This measure could potentially be applied to benchmark the performance of draglines in different operational contexts in which varied pit and block geometries influence the proportion of hoist limited cycles...|$|R
40|$|Much {{is known}} about practice-induced {{plasticity}} of the motor system. But {{it is not clear}} how a physical training influences the mental rehearsal of the practiced task and its associated hemodynamic responses. In the present longitudinal study with two measurement time-points, we used the method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a motor imagery task, in order to explore the dynamic neuro-functional changes induced by a highly complex physical training. The 11 golf novices between the age of 40 and 60 years practiced the motor training as leisure activity. Additionally, data from an age and sex-matched control group without golf training was collected. As a main result, we demonstrate that changes between the two measurement time-points were only found in the golf novice group. The golf novices showed a decrease in hemodynamic responses during the mental rehearsal of the golf <b>swing</b> in non-primary <b>motor</b> areas after the 40 h of golf practice. Thus, the results indicate that a complex physical leisure activity induces functional neuroplasticity in the seldom studied population of middle-aged adults, and that this effect is evident during mental rehearsal of the practiced task. This finding supports the idea that (a) a skill improvement is associated with a modified activation pattern in the associated neuronal network that can be identified during mental rehearsal of the practiced task, and that (b) a strict training protocol is not necessary to induce functional neuroplasticity...|$|R
