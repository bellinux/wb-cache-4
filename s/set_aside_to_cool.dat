5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> <b>cool,</b> and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E

60|$|RECIPE FOR GERMAN COFFEE Take {{a barrel}} of water {{and bring it to}} a boil; rub a chicory berry against a coffee berry, then convey the former into the water. Continue the boiling and {{evaporation}} until the intensity of the flavor and aroma of the coffee and chicory has been diminished to a proper degree; then <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> <b>cool.</b> Now unharness the remains of a once cow from the plow, insert them in a hydraulic press, and when you shall have acquired a teaspoon of that pale-blue juice which a German superstition regards as milk, modify the malignity of its strength in a bucket of tepid water and ring up the breakfast. Mix the beverage in a cold cup, partake with moderation, and keep a wet rag around your head to guard against over-excitement.|$|E

6000|$|Prepare a {{solution}} (much used by M. Pasteur, and often called [...] "Pasteur's solution") composed {{of water with}} tartrate of ammonia, sugar, and yeast- ash dissolved therein.[10] Divide it into three portions in as many flasks; boil all three {{for a quarter of}} an hour; and, while the steam is passing out, stop the neck of one with a large plug of cotton-wool, so that this also may be thoroughly steamed. Now <b>set</b> the flasks <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> <b>cool,</b> and, when their contents are cold, add to one of the open ones a drop of filtered infusion of hay which has stood for twenty-four hours, and is consequently hill of the active and excessively minute organisms known as Bacteria. In a couple of days of ordinary warm weather the contents of this flask will be milky from the enormous multiplication of Bacteria. The other flask, open and exposed to the air, will, sooner or later, become milky with Bacteria, and patches of mould may appear in it; while the liquid in the flask, the neck of which is plugged with cotton-wool, will remain clear for an indefinite time. I have sought in vain for any explanation of these facts, except the obvious one, that the air contains germs competent to give rise to Bacteria, such as those with which the first solution has been knowingly and purposely inoculated, and to the mould-Fungi. And I have not yet been able to meet with any advocate of Abiogenesis who seriously maintains that the atoms of sugar, tartrate of ammonia, yeast-ash, and water, under no influence but that of free access of air and the ordinary temperature, re-arrange themselves and give rise to the protoplasm of Bacterium. But the alternative is to admit that these Bacteria arise from germs in the air; and if they are thus propagated, the burden of proof that other like forms are generated in a different manner, must rest with the assertor of that proposition.|$|R

50|$|Matzo {{dough is}} quickly mixed and rolled out without an autolyse step as used for leavened breads. Most forms are pricked {{with a fork}} or a similar tool to keep the {{finished}} product from puffing up, and the resulting flat piece of dough is cooked at high temperature until it develops dark spots, then <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> and, if sufficiently thin, to harden to crispness. Dough is considered to begin the leavening process 18 minutes from the time it gets wet; sooner if eggs, fruit juice, or milk {{is added to the}} dough. The entire process of making matzo takes only a few minutes in efficient modern matzo bakeries.|$|E
50|$|To prepare rellenitos, plantains are {{cut into}} {{medium-sized}} pieces and boiled with cinnamon until tender. Once they are tender, normally after {{about ten minutes}} of cooking time they are removed, mashed into a paste and <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> <b>cool.</b> The paste is then formed into a small thick tortilla by hand, leaving the center indented resembling a small bowl. The bowl is then filled {{with a mixture of}} black refried beans, chocolate and cinnamon. The filling itself is made by melting Guatemalan or Mayan chocolate in water and then adding refried beans and cinnamon. The bowl is then closed by wrapping the ends of the tortilla until it closes, creating something that resembles an egg — the plantain paste being the shell, with a black bean, chocolate, and cinnamon filling. The rellenito is then fried in a pan with oil until golden brown on all sides. They are generally served with either honey or powdered sugar on top.|$|E

50|$|When making buko pie {{a double}} baking method is followed. The pie crust and the pie filling {{need to be}} {{prepared}} separately before combining the two together. First the pie crust is made by mixing flour, salt and sugar in a bowl. Afterwards, the mixture is made into dough by adding and mixing in ice water and egg yolks. The dough mixture is then refrigerated and thinly rolled out by using a rolling pin. To finish the crust component of the buko pie, the dough is baked and <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> <b>cool.</b> Next, the pie filling is prepared. The pie filling ingredients listed above are mixed and cooked on low heat. Once the pie crust and the pie filling are finished, they are combined together by pouring the filling into the pie crust. A second crust is used to cover the filling and seal the pie from all sides. It is then baked a second time until the crust is lightly browned.|$|E
