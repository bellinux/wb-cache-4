40|$|This {{article is}} an {{examination}} of the interaction between evangelists and participants of a demonic deliverance (exorcism) ceremony in a London, UK Pentecostal church. The data is taken from an online recording and transcribed using Conversation Analysis conventions. A familiar feature of exorcism practice is the initial demand for the demon’s identity. This study suggests that the importance of asking this question is due to it being procedurally strategic in modelling a performative path of the deliverance ceremony, which results in ritual efficacy. In particular, it is proposed that the omission of the question asking for the identity of the demon causes the deliverance path to become temporarily disrupted. This disruption {{is the result of a}} loss of thematic mapping between adverse life events and the causal agency within this specific sphere of <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} solve {{environmental}} problems, {{it is necessary}} to form ecological culture in society. A great opportunity in addressing this problem is design. Design as a global phenomenon, an element of industrial production and <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>activity,</b> connects the material and spiritual cultures, responds to and is determined by social processes. Design has a significant influence on people and can help in solving the environmental issues. For this, ecological thinking of future professionals, ecological culture and ecological competency of designers have to be formed already in the process of design-education. The students have to realize the socio-cultural role and possibilities of their profession, the ecological imperative of design. The authors of this article propose the course of “Ecological Design”, its structure and content. Students get the opportunity to master both the technological and compositional artistic techniques of ecologization of environment...|$|R
40|$|Extract] In {{coming to}} deal with the place of food {{production}} in industrial societies we face a set of strong tensions. There is the productivist view of agriculture as a technical problem of how best to exploit particular biophysical structures and functions to produce the maximum amount of useable food and fibre. Set against this is a spectrum of views of agriculture as a <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>activity</b> that all but defines a particular society or nation, farming as a way of life, through to it being seen as a key agent of economic development. Riding uneasily with all these is the growing understanding of the place of agriculture as the dominant form of human land management on the planet that must account for many landscape functions and processes other than just providing for human needs. We need a framework for understanding agriculture in all its complex roles of providing human sustenance and cultural meanings, as well as delivering ecosystems services...|$|R

40|$|Much {{has been}} {{researched}} on tourism across (former) borders of conflict and on pilgrimage as a <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>activity,</b> but {{the relationship between the}} two remains poorly understood. Pilgrimage-tours carried out by Taiwanese devotees to the birthplace of Mazu (or Tianshang Shengmu – the Heavenly Mother) in Putian, China offer a significant platform to further our understanding of how religion can play a part in the rapprochement between China and Taiwan. Based on ethnographic fieldwork, this paper goes beyond the conventional state-level analysis to discuss interactions and encounters forged at the levels of the temple organisations and the individual. It utilises Victor Turner’s concept of ‘communitas’ to understand how spiritual spaces are being performed through the pilgrimage rather than already existing before the pilgrimage. Importantly, the Mazu pilgrimage-tour is conceptualised not as a tourism product, but as both a social activity and a socialising one, producing opportunities for different forms of interactions between the Chinese and Taiwanese devotees. These ‘interactions along the side’ as opposed to state-level diplomatic exchanges offer insights into the ‘more-than-state’ and ‘more-than-human’ relationships that bind/divide devotees on both sides of the Taiwan Strait...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{education}} {{for sustainable development}} starts covering wider and wider spheres of interest and human activity. Out of the three main spheres of interest, such as environmental, economic, and socio-cultural, the first two mentioned here seem to be given more attention than the sphere of <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>activity.</b> In this respect, {{the aim of the}} present paper is to redirect the concern of administrators, researchers and educators preoccupied with sustainability to issues such as equal opportunity, tolerance, respect, and especially foreign language education, being component parts of the socio-cultural sphere. Undoubtedly, competence in the socio-linguistic field becomes the decisive element in negotiations and international contacts which require from the language user to be tactful and tolerant. Since sustainability is not a local issue, all sustainability related problems ought to be discussed on the macro scale, which requires an internationally shared means of communication such as language. Although no name of any language appears in the paper, it becomes evident that the attention is directed towards English as an internationally recognized language or, if necessary, any other language which might serve as a means of communication on the macro scale...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{traditional}} ways to teach philosophy in secondary school is a historical approach”, which takes a historicist view of philosophy and uses teaching practice based on teacher-centred lessons and textbook study by students. Only recently a debate on different approaches to teach philosophy is developing, considering the discipline as practical and dialogical activity to be fostered in the classroom. What could mean “doing philosophy” in the classroom from an instructional perspective? What are the premises and constraints which allow the transformation of philosophy from a discipline to a community activity? In this paper a teaching model based on cultural-historical theory is proposed and discussed. The model is composed by three level of specification of the activity, from lower to higher, which correspond to three different analysis plans of the philosophical practice in an instructional context. Each level is composed by seven fundamental dimensions which highlight the meanings, the constraints, and the tools implied and developed in philosophizing as <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>activity.</b> Finally, if and how Philosophy for Children should be considered an activity respondent to the model and its educational aims is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} way in which {{cultural}} elements are rendered in subtitling by analyzing the translation of culture-specific references, such as proper names, with the case studies from three American and Thai films: Annie Hall (1977), Juno (2007), and The Iron Ladies (2000). The structure of this research is based on Toury (1995) ’s Descriptive Translation Studies framework. The methodology consists of 1) situating the preliminary norms of Audiovisual Translation in Thailand, which includes the overview of foreign film import and screen translation practice; 2) proceeding to analyse the cultural transfer strategies used in the subtitles in relations to their polysemiotic co-texts and contexts and present descriptive examples; and 3) from the analysis results, comparing the ways American and Thai culture is transferred/transformed to the target audience and explaining the significance. This research aims to take interdisciplinary approach into subtitling, in hope that it will bring more insights about Audiovisual Translation not only as a language transfer, but also as a complex <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>activity,</b> surrounded by norms and many influencing factors. Therefore, the study will combine text analysis and interviews with translation practitioners in order to present subtitling in the real world situation...|$|R
40|$|Translation is {{not only}} a {{linguistic}} activity, but also a <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>activity,</b> and very often even more so at that. As language is part of the socio-culture in which it is used and develops, the meaning of words that are translated must be determined not only by their syntagmatic but more importantly by their socio-cultural contexts (Nida 1993). Following this understanding, it is observed that the developments of any translation tradition must necessarily be conditioned by the related socio-cultural setting in which translation in that tradition occurs. A look into the history of translation, both Chinese and Western, reveals the validity of such an observation. This essay offers a brief discussion {{of the ways in which}} translation developments in the Chinese and Western traditions have been related to the needs and developments of each other’s socio-cultures. The aim is to explore for insights into the socio-cultural bearing of translation and its studies against a translation and cultural studies agenda. It is a matter of course that the Chinese and Western translation traditions are different from each other because they involve different languages and often also different source materials. But one should not be content with this kind of statement...|$|R
