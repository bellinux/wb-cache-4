25|$|The {{study of}} {{immersed}} <b>surfaces</b> <b>in</b> 3-space is closely {{connected with the}} study of knotted (embedded) <b>surfaces</b> <b>in</b> 4-space, by analogy with the theory of knot diagrams (immersed plane curves (2-space) as projections of knotted curves in 3-space): given a knotted <b>surface</b> <b>in</b> 4-space, one can project it to an immersed <b>surface</b> <b>in</b> 3-space, and conversely, given an immersed <b>surface</b> <b>in</b> 3-space, one may ask if it lifts to 4-space – is it the projection of a knotted <b>surface</b> <b>in</b> 4-space?

5|$|Between 1918 and 1926, Route 46 was {{extended}} to Sheridan. Soon after, in 1933, it extended south, two miles east of Sheridan.

Four years later, the route {{was extended}} to Route 27 (now Route 148). In 1954, Route 246 was designated, starting from Sheridan, and ending at Route 46.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the significant lack of genetic diversity in cheetahs is a cause of poor quality and production of sperm, and birth defects such as cramped teeth, kinked tails, and bent limbs. Cheetahs do have low fertility rates, but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level of genetic uniformity would mean that if an infectious disease <b>surfaced</b> <b>in</b> a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the Wildlife Safari (Oregon, United States) died due to a peritonitis epidemic.|$|E
