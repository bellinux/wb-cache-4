25|$|Well before GATT's 40th anniversary, {{its members}} {{concluded}} that the GATT system was straining {{to adapt to a}} new globalizing world economy. In response to the problems identified in the 1982 Ministerial Declaration (structural deficiencies, <b>spill-over</b> impacts of certain countries' policies on world trade GATT could not manage etc.), the eighth GATT round – known as the Uruguay Round – was launched in September 1986, in Punta del Este, Uruguay.|$|E
25|$|The heavy-handed policing, {{including}} the use of tear gas on peaceful protesters, inspired tens of thousands of citizens to join the protests in Admiralty that night. Containment errors by the police– the closure of Tamar Park and Admiralty Station– caused a <b>spill-over</b> {{to other parts of the}} city, including Wan Chai, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok. 3,000 protesters occupied a road in Mong Kok and 1,000 went to Causeway Bay. The total number of protesters on the streets swelled to 80,000, at times considerably exceeding 100,000.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>spill-over</b> {{from the}} gridiron, the Panthers' third-most frequently-played {{opponent}} is the Penn State Nittany Lions, {{whom they have}} played 147 times. Penn State leads the all-time series, 75-72, but has lost the past seven matchups. They played at least once every year from 1935–82 and briefly rekindled the rivalry {{at the turn of}} the century, playing annually from 2000-05. Since that time, they’ve gone against each other just twice, in 2013 as part of the Big Ten-ACC Challenge, and in the 2016 Never Forget Tribute Classic. They are not scheduled to renew the series in the foreseeable future, though there have been significant talks between the universities about doing so.|$|E

2500|$|Macedonians {{were worried}} about the impact that more than 360,000 Albanian {{refugees}} might have on Macedonia's own ethnic mix. They were afraid that the refugees' presence could disturb the Republic's demographic balance. Macedonians {{were worried about}} the possible destructive <b>spill-over</b> effects that could result from the newest phase of the Kosovo conflict and also feared {{that they had the}} most to lose. As a Chicago Tribune journalist stated in March 1999, [...] "People are afraid that after Kosovo comes Macedonia." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{period was}} {{followed}} by attempts in the early 1980s to integrate quantitative genetics into evolutionary biology, which had <b>spill-over</b> effects on other fields, such as behavioral ecology and ecophysiology. [...] In the mid- to late-1980s, phylogenetic comparative methods started to become popular in many fields, including physiological ecology and comparative physiology. [...] A 1987 volume titled [...] "New Directions in Ecological Physiology" [...] had little ecology but a considerable emphasis on evolutionary topics.

2500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1737, Weiser {{attempted}} to broker a peace between southern tribes and the Iroquois. Having survived high snow, freezing temperatures and starvation rations during the six-week journey to the Iroquois capital of Onondaga, he managed to convince the Iroquois not to send any war parties in the spring, but he failed to convince them to send emissaries to parlay with the southern tribes. Impressed with his fortitude {{in the pursuit of}} peace, the Iroquois named Weiser [...] "Tarachiawagon", or [...] "Holder of the Heavens." [...] <b>Spill-over</b> violence from a war between the Iroquois and southern tribes such as the Catawba would have drawn first Virginia, and then Pennsylvania, into conflict with the Iroquois. Therefore this peace-brokering {{had a profound effect on}} Native American/colonial relations.|$|E
2500|$|Fredericksburg has {{profited from}} <b>spill-over</b> tourism of nearby Luckenbach ever since {{a couple of}} events {{propelled}} the little town {{with a population of}} three to global fame. [...] Jerry Jeff Walker recorded his landmark 1973 Viva Terlingua album at the Luckenbach dance hall. [...] In 1977, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson recorded their hit Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love). [...] Additionally, the National Museum of the Pacific War has become a big draw to military history buffs. Fredericksburg has become attractive to retirees and people looking to relocate to a simpler way of life. [...] Real estate became a prime business as prices rose. The city has become a weekend destination for people in Central Texas, specifically those from Austin and San Antonio.|$|E
2500|$|Drogheda was an {{important}} walled town in the English Pale in the medieval period. It frequently hosted meetings of the Irish Parliament at that time. In a <b>spill-over</b> from the War of the Roses the Earl of Desmond and his two youngest sons (still children) were executed there on Valentine's Day, 1468, according to R.J.Mitchell in John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, on orders of the Earl of Worcester, the Lord Deputy of Ireland. It later came to light (see Robert Fabyan, [...] "The New Chronicles of England and France"), that the Queen herself was implicated in the orders given. The parliament {{was moved to the}} town in 1494 and passed Poynings' Law, the most significant legislation in Irish history, a year later. This effectively subordinated the Irish Parliament's legislative powers to the King and his English Council.|$|E
2500|$|... "Russia has clear hegemonic {{aspirations}} in {{the former}} Soviet space. Although {{a wide array of}} opinions is expressed on Russian policy in the newly independent states in the media and in parliament, a dominant consensus appears to have emerged among foreign policy influentials on the need for active presence and influence in the area. Such views have been widely expressed in official statements, influential statements by independent policy groups and by advisers to the president, influential political figures and the president himself. The hegemonic component of Russian policy in the near abroad is evident in its efforts to restore Russian control over the external borders of the former Soviet Union, to reassume control over the Soviet air defence network, to obtain agreements on basing Russian forces in the non-Russian republics and by its obvious sensitivity to external military presences (including multilateral ones) on the soil of the former Soviet Union. To judge from Russian policy on Caspian Sea and Central Asian energy development, it extends beyond the political/security realm and into the economic one. Its sources are diverse and include the Russian imperial hangover, but more practically the fate of the Russian diaspora, the lack of developed defences along the borders of the Russian Federation proper, concern over Islam and discomfort with the <b>spill-over</b> effects of instability in the other republics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Besides {{the obvious}} concern with <b>spill-over</b> {{violence}} {{along the border}}, US military leaders along the border carried out surveillance of German espionage activities. With the British interception of the Zimmermann telegram in 1917, the US knew well of the German Empire's attempt to bring Mexico into the war {{on the side of}} the Central Powers. [...] US anxiety over Germany's overtures to Mexico notwithstanding, the war-weary Mexican nation was in a markedly disadvantaged position from which to engage in the sort of military reconquest of the US Southwest (an area that had been Mexican national territory prior to the 1846–48 U.S.–Mexico War and its peace, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo) that was envisioned in the Zimmermann telegram. The seemingly interminable Mexican Revolution led to the devastation of the overall Mexican economy, causing food shortages throughout the nation (including northern Sonora) and a mass migration of Mexicans into the United States through ports of entry such as Nogales. Additionally, the 1916-1917 Punitive Expedition vividly exposed the differences between the US and Mexico in terms of logistics. Though recognized as the legitimate leader of the Mexican Republic, President Venustiano Carranza did not control large swaths of territory--such as the regions held by Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata. Moreover, the US use of motor vehicles and two airplanes during the Punitive Expedition stood in stark contrast to the conditions existing within the Mexican Federal Army and the various disparate militias, where weapons, bullets, uniforms and even food could often be in very short supply.|$|E

50|$|In 1980, {{the pattern}} was towards urbanization. This {{was due to}} the pull of newly {{installed}} infrastructures, particularly roads, and the sporadic growth of trade in strategically situated municipalities that have better economic opportunities. The 1990 growth originated from the strong attraction of employment opportunities in established urban centers, which have become a source of growth of adjacent municipalities. This situation was highly evident in Naga and Legazpi areas, whose surrounding municipalities exhibited high growth rates. Unmistakably, the <b>spill-over</b> effects of development permeated those initial high growth areas.|$|E
