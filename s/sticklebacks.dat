5|$|Breeding {{experiments}} to study evolution and genetics. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are inbred through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics. These provide animals of a known genetic background, {{an important tool}} for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction, though some scientists take advantage of inbred domesticated animals, such as dog or cattle breeds, for comparative purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their niche) produce adaptations in their physiology and morphology. As an example, <b>sticklebacks</b> are now being used to study how many and which types of mutations are selected to produce adaptations in animals' morphology during the evolution of new species.|$|E

5000|$|Apeltes quadracus, the Fourspine <b>stickleback</b> or Bloody <b>stickleback</b> is {{a species}} of <b>stickleback</b> {{belonging}} to the order Gasterosteiformes which lives in freshwater, brackish and benthopelagic environments of the northwestern Atlantic Ocean between Newfoundland and South Carolina.|$|R
25|$|Male <b>sticklebacks</b> {{are well}} known for their habit of {{building}} an enclosed nest made of pieces of vegetation glued together with secretions from their kidneys. Foam nests, made up of air bubbles glued together with mucus from the mouth, are also well known in gouramis and armoured catfish.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{generally}} prefer larger shoals. This makes sense, as larger shoal usually {{provide better}} protection against predators. Indeed, {{the preference for}} larger shoals seems stronger when predators are nearby, or in species that rely more on shoaling than body armour against predation. Larger shoals may also find food faster, though that food {{would have to be}} shared amongst more individuals. Competition may mean that hungry individuals might prefer smaller shoals or exhibit a lesser preference for very large shoals, as shown in <b>sticklebacks.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hypoxia can modify normal behavior. Parental {{behaviour}} {{meant to}} provide oxygen to the eggs is often affected by hypoxia. For example, fanning behavior (swimming {{on the spot}} near the eggs to create a flow of water over them, and thus a constant supply of oxygen) is often increased when oxygen is less available. This has been documented in <b>sticklebacks,</b> gobies, and clownfishes, among others. Gobies may also {{increase the size of}} the openings in the nest they build, even though this may increase the risk of predation on the eggs. Rainbow cichlids often move their young fry closer to the water surface, where oxygen is more available, during hypoxic episodes.|$|E
50|$|Certain large invertebrates, birds, mammals, {{and fish}} all prey on the brook <b>stickleback.</b> With its small size, this species of <b>stickleback</b> has evolved {{piercing}} spines and protective plates to hinder predators. With this protection, {{as well as}} advanced anti-predator behavior, the brook <b>stickleback</b> is only a minor prey item. In a lab study, adult water bugs (Lethocerus americanus) and dragonfly nymphs (Aeschna spp.) both successfully preyed on the <b>stickleback,</b> but only in a night setting. Fish have been observed {{to be the most}} successful predator of the brook <b>stickleback.</b> Examples of these fish predators include: yellow perch (Perca flavescens), rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), burbot (Lota lota), central mudminnow (Umbra limi), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), northern pike (Esox lucius), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Brook <b>stickleback</b> eggs can be cannibalized, as well as consumed by rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Competition among the ninespine <b>stickleback</b> exists. However, ninespine <b>stickleback</b> habitat exists in the pelagic zone, while the brook <b>stickleback</b> occupies the littoral zone. In the presence of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), the brook <b>stickleback</b> has a more diverse diet since the fathead is a more generalist feeder.|$|R

40|$|Background: Threespine <b>stickleback</b> (Gasterosteus aculeatus) show {{patterns}} of trait divergence between habitats that are repeated across many watersheds. For example, stream <b>stickleback</b> generally have deeper bodies than do lake <b>stickleback.</b> Parallel divergence {{of this sort}} {{is often used to}} infer the power and predictability of natural selection, but how rapidly such lake– stream differences can evolve is unknown. An opportunity to address this uncertainty was provided when two reservoirs on the Hendry Vineyard in Napa, California, were constructed in the early 1970 s and filled with water (and thus <b>stickleback)</b> from the adjacent creek. Question: Do reservoir and creek <b>stickleback</b> on the Hendry Vineyard show morphological divergence typical of lake and stream <b>stickleback?</b> Samples: <b>Stickleback</b> from the reservoirs and creek in each of two years, combined with <b>stickleback</b> from six lake–stream pairs on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Methods: Multivariate analyses of univariate traits and geometric morphometric variables. Results: Reservoir and creek <b>stickleback</b> differed only marginally in morphology, especially compared with lake and stream <b>stickleback</b> from Vancouver Island. In contrast to low divergence between habitats on the Hendry Vineyard, morphological variation was very high within habitats. Conclusions: Reservoir–creek divergence in Hendry Vineyard <b>stickleback</b> is seemingly con-strained by a combination of weak divergent selection, high gene flow, and limited time for divergence. On the other hand, the high variation within these populations might be used to study the origins and fate of phenotypic variation...|$|R
25|$|Threespine <b>sticklebacks</b> (Gasterosteus spp.) in post-glacial {{lakes in}} western Canada have contributed {{significantly}} to recent research of character displacement. Both observations of natural populations and manipulative experiments show that when two recently evolved species occur in a single lake, two morphologies are selected for: a limnetic form that feeds in open water and a benthic form that feeds at the lake bottom. They differ in size, shape and the number and length of gill rakers, {{all of which is}} related to divergence in their diet. Hybrids between the two forms are selected against. When only one species inhabits a lake, that fish displays an intermediate morphology. Studies on other fish species have shown similar patterns of selection for benthic and limnetic morphologies, which can also lead to sympatric speciation.|$|E

500|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{exists in}} some species. Individuals of one sex, usually males develop {{secondary sexual characteristics}} that increase their chances of reproductive success. In dolphinfish, males have larger and blunter heads than females. In several minnow species, males develop swollen heads and small bumps known as breeding tubercles during the breeding season. The male green humphead parrotfish has a more well-developed forehead with an [...] "ossified ridge" [...] which {{plays a role in}} ritualised headbutting. Dimorphism can also take the form of differences in coloration. Again, it is usually the males that are brightly coloured; in killifishes, rainbowfishes and wrasses the colours are permanent while in species like minnows, <b>sticklebacks,</b> darters and sunfishes, the colour changes with seasons. Such coloration can be very conspicuous to predators, showing that the drive to reproduce can be stronger than that to avoid predation.|$|E

500|$|The {{quality of}} water in the ship canal remains {{adversely}} affected by several factors. The high population density of the Mersey Basin has, historically, placed heavy demands on sewage treatment and disposal. Industrial and agricultural discharges into the Irwell, Medlock, and Irk rivers are responsible for a number of industrial contaminants found in the canal. Matters have improved since 1990, when the National Rivers Authority found the area between Trafford Road Bridge and Mode Wheel Locks to be [...] "grossly polluted". The water was depleted of dissolved oxygen, which {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century often resulted in toxic sediments normally present at the bottom of the turning basin in what is now Salford Quays rising to the surface during the summer months, giving the impression of solid ground. [...] Previously, only roach and <b>sticklebacks</b> could be found in the canal's upper levels, and then only during the colder parts of the year, but an oxygenation project implemented at Salford Quays from 2001, together with the gradual reduction of industrial pollutants from the Mersey's tributaries, has encouraged the migration into the canal of fish populations from further upstream. The canal's water quality remains low, with mercury and cadmium in particular present at [...] "extremely high levels". Episodic pollution and a lack of habitat remain problems for wildlife, although in 2005, for the first time in living memory, salmon were observed breeding in the River Goyt (a part of the Mersey's catchment). In 2010 the Environment Agency issued a report concluding that the canal [...] "does not pose a significant barrier to salmon movement or impact on migratory behaviours".|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Stickleback</b> fishes are an {{outstanding}} model for understanding evolution and ecology. Celebrating successes and identifying new questions, the Seventh International Conference on <b>Stickleback</b> Behaviour and Evolution was held 29 July to 3 August 2012 near Seattle, Washington, USA. Questions: How has research on <b>stickleback</b> shaped {{our understanding of}} phenotypic variation, genomic variation, speciation, and eco-evolutionary dynamics? How is future research on <b>stickleback</b> likely to advance these topics? Phenotypic variation: <b>Stickleback</b> show exceptional variation at a diversity of spatial scales, which has yielded insights not only into how natural selection shapes evolutionary diversifi-cation, but also how the influence of natural selection can be constrained. Future research would profit from examining temporal variation in selection and the multifarious nature of selection. Genomic variation: <b>Stickleback</b> adapted to different environments show widespread, but heterogeneous, genomic differentiation that {{is often associated with}} variation in recombinatio...|$|R
40|$|Background: Some {{populations of}} <b>stickleback</b> have a reduced number and/or {{relative}} size of spines. Hypothesis: Macroinvertebrate predators such as dragonfly larvae cause selective pressure against spines by capturing more <b>stickleback</b> with pelvic spines than <b>stickleback</b> that are spineless. Organisms: Ninespine <b>stickleback</b> (Pungitius pungitius) and dragonfly larvae (Aeshna grandis). Methods: We used 10 <b>stickleback,</b> five with pelvic spines and five with their pelvic spines removed. We {{put them in}} containers with two dragonfly larvae. Every day for 4 days we monitored how many <b>stickleback</b> were captured by the larvae. We repeated this experiment ten times at two different densities of fish and predators. We also developed a model to determine whether selection for spinelessness can be distinguished from drift. Results: Dragonfly larvae caught as many <b>stickleback</b> with spines as without. The absence of spines {{was not associated with}} a decrease in predation risk. We substituted Bayesian estimates of the selection coefficient into quantitative genetic models of allele frequency change, and the results of the models suggest that the selective advantage of spine loss is so small that its effects cannot be distinguished from drift...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{disentangle}} {{the contribution of}} host and parasite biology to host specificity, we compared the structure and population dynamics of the Gyrodactylus (von Nordmann, 1832) flatworm community living oil sympatric three-spined Gasterosteus aculeatus L. and nine-spined Pungitins pungitius (L.) <b>stickleback.</b> Between April 2002 and March 2003, a small lowland creek was sampled monthly. Species identity of about 75 % of the worms per host was determined with a genetic nuclear marker (ITSI). Each <b>stickleback</b> species hosted a characteristic gill- and in-parasitic Gyrodactylus: G. arcuatus Bychowsky, 1933 and G. gasterostei Glaser, 1974 respectively infecting the three-spined <b>stickleback,</b> with G. rarus Wegener, 1910 and G. pungitii Malmberg, 1964 infecting the nine-spined <b>stickleback.</b> Host size and seasonal dynamics were strong determinants of parasite abundance. A strong interaction between host and parasite species determined infection levels and affected three levels of parasite organisation: community structure, population structure and topographical specialisation. Community and population structure were shaped by asymmetric cross-infections, resulting in a net transmission of the Gyrodactylus species typical of the nine-spined <b>stickleback</b> towards the three-spined <b>stickleback.</b> I-lost density was not {{a major determinant of}} parasite exchange.

2500|$|Larvae and pupae are {{important}} food items for fish, such as trout, banded killifish, and <b>sticklebacks,</b> {{and for many}} other aquatic organisms as well such as newts.

[...] So do predatory water beetles in families such as the Dytiscidae and Hydrophilidae. The flying midges are eaten by fish and insectivorous birds, such as swallows and martins.

40|$|Numerous {{theoretical}} models suggest that sympatric speciation is possible when frequency-dependent interactions such as intraspecific competition drive disruptive selection on a trait {{that is also}} subject to assortative mating. Here, I review recent evidence that both conditions are met in lake populations of threespine <b>stickleback</b> (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Nonetheless, sympatric speciation appears to be rare or absent in <b>stickleback.</b> If <b>stickleback</b> qualitatively fit the theoretical requirements for sympatric speciation, why do they not undergo sympatric speciation? I present simulations showing that disruptive selection and assortative mating in <b>stickleback,</b> though present, are too weak to drive speciation. Furthermore, I summarize empirical evidence that disruptive selection in <b>stickleback</b> drives other forms of evolutionary diversification (plasticity, increased trait variance, and sexual dimorphism) instead of speciation. In conclusion, core assumptions of sympatric speciation theory seem to be qualitatively reasonable for <b>stickleback,</b> but speciation may nevertheless fail because of (i) quantitative mismatches with theory and (ii) alternative evolutionary outcomes...|$|R

[...] The river system contains, amongst others, brown trout, sea trout, salmon, eels, minnows, lampreys, and <b>sticklebacks.</b> The brown colour of the Irvine at places like Darvel and Newmilns is not a result of pollution, but simply organic material washed out of the peat banks at the watershed.

2500|$|Quorum sensing can {{function}} as a collective decision-making process in any decentralised system. A quorum response {{has been defined as}} [...] "a steep increase in the probability of group members performing a given behaviour once a threshold minimum number of their group mates already performing that behaviour is exceeded". A recent investigation showed that small groups of fish used consensus decision-making when deciding which fish model to follow. The fish did this by a simple quorum rule such that individuals watched the decisions of others before making their own decisions. This technique generally resulted in the 'correct' decision but occasionally cascaded into the 'incorrect' decision. In addition, as the group size increased, the fish made more accurate decisions in following the more attractive fish model. Consensus decision-making, a form of collective intelligence, thus effectively uses information from multiple sources to generally reach the correct conclusion. Such behaviour has also been demonstrated in the shoaling behaviour of threespine <b>sticklebacks.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A pike {{has a very}} typical hunting behavior; it is able {{to remain}} {{stationary}} in the water by moving the last fin rays of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins. Before striking, it bends its body and darts out to the prey using the large surface of its caudal fin, dorsal fin, and anal fin to propel itself. The fish has a distinctive habit of catching its prey sideways in the mouth, immobilising it with its sharp, backward-pointing teeth, and then turning the prey headfirst to swallow it. For larger prey, the pike will usually attempt to drown the prey before carrying it off to be consumed. It eats mainly fish and frogs, but also small mammals and birds fall prey to pike. Young pike have been found dead from choking on a pike of a similar size, an observation referred to by the renowned English poet Ted Hughes in his famous poem [...] "Pike". Northern pike also feed on insects, and leeches. They are not very particular and eat spiny fish like perch, and will even take fish as small as <b>sticklebacks</b> if they are the only available prey.|$|E

Both complexes exhibit phenomenal morphological and eco-logical diversity, including rare phenotypes, in the Cook Inlet Basin in Southcentral Alaska. The Cook Inlet threespine <b>stickleback</b> radiation {{has been used}} intensively since the early 1990 s to study the genetic and behavioural mechanisms of rapid evolution and speciation, loss of skeletal elements and armor structures, body shape evolution, evolution of develop-ment and developmental abnormalities, behavioural evolution, life history evolution, trophic ecology, parasitism, genetic structure and function, and effects of environmental contami-nants. Unique populations from both species complexes should be conserved to protect the scientific investment in these radiations and their future utility for research.

Goals: Test hypotheses that divergent phenotypes {{of freshwater}} threespine <b>stickleback</b> evolve {{at the same}} rate as in other species and that derived freshwater and ancestral oceanic (i. e. marine or anadromous) phenotypes are genetically additive. Update a model for contemporary evolution and adaptive radiation based on new genetic and genomic findings. Methods: Summarize published information on contemporary evolution of threespine <b>stickleback</b> and compare published <b>stickleback</b> rates of evolution to those of other species. Analyse F 1 hybrid and pure crosses to estimate the coefficient of genetic dominance of pheno-types that differ between oceanic and freshwater populations. Review published information on the genetics and genomics of <b>stickleback</b> phenotypes. Results: Threespine <b>stickleback</b> populations that experience large environmental changes may evolve measurably for multiple traits within ten generations. Rare freshwater-adapted alleles have been recycled from freshwater to oceanic populations by introgression and increase to high frequencies when oceanic <b>stickleback</b> colonize fresh water. These freshwater-adapted alleles tend to be partially recessive, to produce adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and to be linked within several genomic regions, which facilitates their retention in oceanic populations and the evolutionary response to directional selection after invasion of fresh water. Conclusion: The metapopulation structure and great age of the threespine <b>stickleback</b> have produced a genomic architecture and abundant allelic variation that are conducive to pre-dictable contemporary adaptive radiation involving numerous genes and phenotypic traits...|$|R
