40|$|Bibliography: pages [50]- 51. The {{present study}} {{investigated}} what William T. Powers, in 1978, called the Behavioral Illusion: When an individual controls {{the value of}} an environmental variable by monitoring that variable and offsetting would be disturbances with compensatory output, the compensatory output often appears to constitute the individual's behavior, even though that output is driven by the disturbance. Conversely, the controlled input often goes unrecognized as the individual's behavior. Two experiments were conducted to examine the phenomenon. In Experiment 1, subjects passively watched for three minutes as an operator controlled the horizontal position of a symbol (x) on a computer screen by offsetting computer-generated disturbances with a computer mouse. The mouse's movements were reflected by another <b>symbol</b> (<b>o)</b> on the screen. Each subject observed the operator either continuously or discontinuously engaged in the task, with 80 subjects in each condition. In the discontinuous condition, the operator released the mouse during the second minute. At the end of the three minutes, subjects answered the question "Which of the two letters best represents the operator's behavior, x or o?" Experiment 2 differed from Experiment 1 only in that the subjects (80, 40 in each condition) actively manipulated a computer joystick which influenced the position of either x or o, depending upon a subject-determined switch setting. Subjects in the continuous and discontinuous conditions selected the <b>symbol</b> <b>o</b> with a relative frequency of 87. 5 % and 80 %, respectively, in Experiment 1, and 70 % and 52. 5 %, respectively, in Experiment 2. A multidimensional X² analysis of the combined data yielded {{a significant main effect for}} each independent variable, with no interaction: continuous vs. discontinuous; X² (1) = 10. 88, p <. 001 and, active vs. passive; X² (1) = 8. 98, p <. 001. Being unable to see the computer disturbance which drove the compensatory mouse movements reflected by the <b>symbol</b> <b>o,</b> subjects tended to perceive the position of <b>symbol</b> <b>o</b> as being the operator's, rather than the disturbance's, doing. However, the incidence of this misperception was reduced when subjects viewed discontinuities in the behaver's conduct, or worked at cross-purposes with the behaver. Implications for attribution theory are discussed. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R

We review existing work on quantifying semantic information, then investigate a model-theoretical approach for semantic data compression and reliable semantic communication. We relate {{our approach to}} the statistical measurement of information by Shannon, and show that Shannon’s source and channel coding theorems have semantic counterparts. I. BACKGROUND It has long been recognized that the broad subject of communication goes beyond what Shannon’s theory [18] {{and many of its}} extensions cover.

We formalize it as {{the problem of}} combining the outcomes of several different classifiers {{in a way that}} provides a coherent inference that satisfies some constraints, and develop two general approaches for it. The first is a Markovian approach that extends standard HMMs to allow the use of a rich observations structure and of general classifiers to model state-observation dependencies. The second is an extension of constraint satisfaction formalisms. We also develop efficient algorithms under both models and study them experimentally in the context of shallow parsing. 1 1 Identifying Phrase Structure The problem of identifying phrase structure can be formalized as follows.
