By the term standardisation, we broadly mean the process of developing and implementing technical standards within a <b>standardisation</b> <b>body.</b> Underlining the explorative nature of this paper, we describe the process of identifying future fields of standardisation. To provide a systematic forecasting view on complex science and technology fields, a combination of quantitative indicator-based analyses and qualitative in-depth Delphi surveys is choosen. Firstly, statistical analyses of suitable indicators are used to identify dynamic developments in such fields. Secondly, to identify detailed challenges for future standardisation, qualitative Delphi surveys are conducted. To collect and evaluate relevant issues the respective expert communities were included. They were identified by using information derived from the science and technology databases used. The paper concludes with the assessment of the chosen approach and give practical insights for its feasibility based on a review of the existing literature on the Delphi methodology. In addition, an outlook for further improvements and other possible fields of application is given...|$|R

30|$|The NOEC-values (BLM v. 0.0. 0.17) {{exceeded}} the bioassay EC 50 -values for the algae, with {{a factor of}} 2.5 – 9.3. They also {{exceeded the}} calculated PNEC-values {{by a factor of}} 2.2 in Abiskojaure up to a factor of 9.1 in Älgsjön and St. Envättern. Since the Cu NOEC value reflects the concentration where there should be no negative effect on the algal growth rate, it is notable that the NOEC value was higher than the measured EC 50, i.e. the estimated Cu concentration for 50  % growth reduction. However, since the use of NOEC values in ecotoxicology is strongly questioned by international <b>standardisations</b> <b>bodies</b> [22], the BLM software should use an ECx endpoint instead. BLM v. 0.0. 0.17 overall gave a larger deviation between calculated and measured values than BLM v. 2.2. 3. BLM v. 2.2. 3, which uses a conversion factor to calculate chronic toxicity, produced results for the two Daphnia species within a factor of two. Thus, in these soft waters BLM v. 2.2. 3 calculated more similar results compared to the bioassays. This since BLM v. 0.0. 0.17 calculated algae NOEC values (where no growth inhibition is expected), which were higher than the measured EC 50 values (concentration where there was a 50  % growth inhibition). Furthermore, even though BLM v. 2.2. 3 is an acute model, the approach of using the conversion factor seems to be working, at least for the investigated waters.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a pilot project}} (INTERNORM) funded by the University of Lausanne (2010 - 2013) to support the involvement of civil society organisations (CSO) in international standard setting bodies such as the ISO. It analyses how a distinct participatory mechanism can influence the institutional environment of technical diplomacy in which standards are shaped. The project {{is an attempt to}} respond to the democratic deficit attested in the field of international standardisation, formally open to civil society participation, but still largely dominated by expert knowledge and market players. Many international standards have direct implications on society as a whole, but CSOs (consumers and environmental associations, trade unions) are largely under-represented in negotiation arenas. The paper draws upon international relations literature on new institutional forms in global governance and studies of participation in science and technology. It argues that there are significant limitations to the rise of civil society participation in such global governance mechanisms. The INTERNORM project has been designed as a platform of knowledge exchange between CSO and academic experts, with earmarked funding and official membership to a national <b>standardisation</b> <b>body.</b> But INTERNORM cannot substitute for a long- established lack of resources in time, money and expertise of CSOs. Despite high entry costs into technical diplomacy, participation thus appears as less a matter of upstream engagement, or of procedure only, than of dedicated means to shift the geometry of actors and the framing of socio-technical change...|$|R
40|$|The {{deliberate}} release {{of genetically modified}} organisms (GMOs) implies the potential occurrence of environmental impacts which are either unexpected or only partially predictable and, thus, necessitates development of appropriate monitoring methodology. Therefore, new challenges have to be met when implementing the post market environmental monitoring (PMEM) of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which is mandatory according to the European legal framework. According to Directive 2001 / 18 /EC PMEM has to follow standard methodologies, wherever available and appropriate. To provide all involved parties with appropriate standard monitoring methods, the so called VDI Guidelines are developed by working groups established by the Association of German Engineers (VDI). These working groups are composed by external experts participating on a voluntary basis. The VDI is an independent technical <b>standardisation</b> <b>body.</b> All Guidelines are published in German and English and can therefore be used throughout Europe. VDI Guidelines {{are available in the}} field of exposure of the environment to GM plants (e. g. standardised sampling of pollen, standardised observation of hybrids or ferals), bio-molecular analyses (e. g. standardised extraction and detection of transgenes or their products in different environmental compartments), and the standardised monitoring of effects on non-target organisms (e. g. butterflies, wild bees, amphibians or soil organisms).

The protocol {{may be used for}} voice calls, video calls, video conferencing, gaming and many more. The 3 GPP (3 rd Generation Partnership Project) suggests SIP as the signalling solution for 3 rd generation telephony. Thereby, this purely IP-centric protocol appears as a promising alternative to older signalling systems such as H. 323, SS 7 or analog signals in PSTN. In contrast to them, SIP does not focus on communication with PSTN network. It is more similar to HTTP than to any of the mentioned protocols. The main <b>standardisation</b> <b>body</b> behind Session Initiation Protocol is The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The most recent paper published on SIP is RFC 3261 [5]. Moreover, there are working groups within IETF that publish suggestions and extensions to the main standard. One of those extensions is “Caller Preferences for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) ” [1]. This document describes a set of new rules that allow a caller to express preferences about request handling in servers. They give ability to select which Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) a request gets routed to, and to specify certain request handling directives in proxies and redirect servers. It does so by defining three new request header fields, Accept-Contact, Reject-Contact, and Request-Disposition, which specify the caller preferences. [1].

Quality Infrastructure {{is important because}} it provides technical support to companies to improve their production processes and ensuring compliance to regulations or international requirements. Quality Infrastructure refers to six foremost institutions, being the accreditation body, inspection body, testing laboratory, certification body, metrology institution and <b>standardisation</b> <b>body.</b> This study compares and analyses whether QI in Sweden and the Republic of South Africa. RSA plays a role in eliminating non-compliance for their markets and establish if QI {{have an impact on the}} economy of both countries, and determining the gaps of QI in both countries. The research methodology was qualitative. The primary data were collected with structured questionnaire whereas the secondary data were collected by using library searches. The literature review showed that earlier research acknowledges the importance for trade of QI in countries. The researcher has discovered that the respondents from RSA and Sweden agree that QI helps to reduce the inferior products in the market and add value in the economy of their countries. Based on the data collected from RSA and Sweden it shows that there is no difference between the QI of both countries relating to the eliminating of non-compliance in their markets and adding value in the economy of their countries. From the data collected, it is concluded that, when compared, the QI from RSA and Sweden can reduce non-compliance and add value to the economy of these countries. Although there are some differences and similarities from QI of RSA and Sweden, the researcher strongly recommends the following: [...] M. Tech...|$|R
