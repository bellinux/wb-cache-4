25|$|After {{accompanying}} {{her father}} to Manila on her return to Hong Kong, and before heading back to Dapitan to live with Rizal, Josephine introduced herself to members of Rizal's family in Manila. His mother suggested a civil marriage, which she {{believed to be a}} lesser sacrament but less sinful to Rizal's conscience than making any <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> retraction in order to gain permission from the Bishop. Rizal and Josephine lived as husband and wife in a common-law marriage in Talisay in Dapitan. The couple had a son who lived only for a few hours after Josephine suffered a miscarriage; Rizal named him after his father Francisco.|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression {{ended at}} {{different}} times in different countries with the effect lasting into the next era. America's Great Depression ended in 1941 with America's entry into World War II. The majority of countries set up relief programs, and most underwent some <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> upheaval, pushing them {{to the left or}} right. In some world states, the desperate citizens turned toward nationalist demagogues—the most infamous being Adolf Hitler—setting the stage for the next era of war. The convulsion brought on by the worldwide depression resulted in the rise of Nazism. In Asia, Japan became an ever more assertive power, especially with regards to China.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Junius Richard Jayewardene's {{government}} {{agreed to}} devolve {{power by the}} means of District Development Councils upon the request of TULF. By this time, LTTE and other insurgent groups wanted a separate state. They had no faith in any <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> solution. Thus the TULF and other Tamil political parties were steadily marginalised and insurgent groups emerged as the major force in the north. During {{this period of time}} several other insurgent groups came into the arena, such as EROS (1975), TELO (1979), PLOTE (1980), EPRLF (1980) and TELA (1982). LTTE ordered civilians to boycott the local government elections of 1983 in which TULF contested. Voter turnout became as low as 10%. Thereafter, Tamil political parties were largely unable to represent Tamil people as insurgent groups took over their position.|$|E
25|$|The Avan dynasty {{was partly}} {{contemporary}} {{with that of}} the Mesopotamian emperor Sargon of Akkad, who not only defeated the Awan king Luhi-ishan and subjected Susa, but attempted to make the East Semitic Akkadian the official language there. From this time, Mesopotamian sources concerning Elam become more frequent, since the Mesopotamians had developed an interest in resources (such as wood, stone, and metal) from the Iranian plateau, and military expeditions to the area became more common. With the collapse of Akkad under Sargon's great great-grandson, Shar-kali-sharri, Elam declared independence under the last Avan king, Kutik-Inshushinak (c. 2240 – c. 2220), and threw off the Akkadian language, promoting in its place the brief Linear Elamite script. Kutik-Inshushinnak conquered Susa and Anshan, and seems to have achieved some <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> unity. Following his reign, the Awan dynasty collapsed as Elam was temporarily overrun by the Guti, another pre-Iranic people from what is now north west Iran who also spoke a language isolate.|$|E

Roberts rejoined: [...] "But that is a description of Frederick's motive for displaying the banner; {{it is not an}} interpretation of what the banner says." [...] Second, the dissent emphasized the importance of political speech and the need to foster [...] "national debate about a serious issue".

It is also argued that this is in fact efficient for the environmental pressure groups, since {{it allows them to}} manifest their valuation of a good with lesser strain on their consumption of other goods.

The leader of the banned Croatian Peasant Party, Vladko Maček was held in Jasenovac from October 1941 to March 1942, after which he was kept under strict house arrest. Jasenovac consisted of a unique camp for children in Sisak. Around 20,000 Serb, Jewish and Roma children perished at Jasenovac.|$|R

40|$|With {{the rise}} of {{globalization}} and Europeanization Hungarian ethno-linguistic minorities in the Carpathian Region have become ‘mobile’ {{in the broadest sense}} of the concept.

In Marácz (2014 a), one of these transnational confi gurations has been characterized as a ‘quadratic nexus’ with at least four diff erent actors, one of them being the ethno-linguistic minority. In this paper, I will argue that an analysis of inter-ethnic relations in terms of local dynamics, like the one elaborated in Brubaker et al. (2006) for the Romanian-Hungarian relations in the multi-ethnic, multilingual region of Romania’s Transylvania is no longer adequate against the backdrop of globalization and Europeanization.

40|$|Calls for {{a renewed}} sense of “good citizenship” {{in the early}} twentieth century were loud and persistent.

Such attributes were seen as vital in an economically and militarily competitive world. Historians have already examined the <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> and bodily education that arose from these concerns. This article instead looks at how the focus on the body and citizenship was realized in the actual processes of school building.
