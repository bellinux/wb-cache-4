500|$|Holliday's {{favorite}} player {{growing up}} was Cal Ripken, Jr. [...] He {{has stated that}} if he had a dream car it would be a Bentley Continental GT, rather than a sports car, because he is [...] "too big for small sports cars." [...] He is a Christian and is part of a Bible study group with fellow Christian teammates. [...] He has spoken about his faith saying, [...] "I play for God. [...] It says in the Bible that we are to do all things for Him. ... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do the best that I can for Him. [...] This is my job, not who I am."

500|$|Charlie's {{understanding}} of the world is depicted as omniscient, as when he asks Barton about [...] "the two lovebirds next door", {{despite the fact that they}} are several doors away. When Barton asks how he knows about them, Charlie responds: [...] "Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'." [...] His total awareness of the events at the Earle demonstrate the kind of understanding needed to show real empathy, as described by Audrey. This theme returns when Charlie explains in his final scene: [...] "Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> help them out." ...|$|E
500|$|Williams's role in AC/DC was {{to provide}} steady but basic bass lines which {{followed}} the rhythm guitar of Malcolm Young, consisting mostly of eighth notes. His basslines were sometimes written by Malcolm and Angus Young during composition, {{and at other times}} Williams developed them based on the other instrumental tracks. Williams said he plays [...] "the same thing in every song, for the most part. In AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it." [...] He added that [...] "complex [...] lines wouldn't add anything to a guitar-oriented band like ours, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> create a bottom layer that drives what our guys are doing on top." [...] Williams had no difficulty keeping his low profile within the band, declaring that [...] "I don't have any problem doing this, because I enjoy playing simply. I never feel angry or prisoner." [...] His playing technique was mostly centred around downpicking, with occasional use of plucking to mute the strings, which he says [...] "adds more definition and tightens up the notes, and it gives the sound less sustain".|$|E

500|$|Richie Egan is the {{principal}} songwriter but refers to the overall band as Jape. This came about following his first few solo performances when he realised he did not wish people to consider him a singer-songwriter {{but as part of}} a band. Egan has been part of many bands from a young age, and spent his youth experimenting with four-track tape recorders and sounds. He was previously a member of the bands Black Belt Jones and Sir Killalot. After leaving Black Belt Jones he {{went on to become the}} bassist in the instrumental rock band The Redneck Manifesto of which he is still a member. He has occasionally toured as part of David Kitt’s live band, as well as in Conor J. O'Brien's band Villagers as a bass player and with his bandmates in The Redneck Manifesto. By 2003 Egan had developed Jape after spending a week at the family home of fellow Redneck, Niall Byrne, in Avoca, County Wicklow. [...] "I’ve been playing in bands since I was really young but I’ve always been messing around on the side with four-track tape recorders, experimenting with sounds". [...] "The chance to turn this “messing around” into something concrete came about when he was given the opportunity to decamp to Avoca, where fellow Redneck, Niall’s family own a house. Richie used it as a studio for a week." [...] "I listen to a lot of different styles of music, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> keep my finger in as many pies as possible. It keeps me interested," [...] he laughs." ...|$|E

The letter was from Mrs. Vervain, and it entreated {{him to come}} to lunch at twelve, and then join them on an excursion, of which they had all often talked, up the Canal of the Brenta.

60|$|I {{have not}} the memory for bridge. I forget {{who it was}} that, last trick but seven, played the two of clubs. I thought it was he, my partner. I thought it meant that I was to take an early {{opportunity}} of forcing trumps. I don't know why I thought <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> explain why I thought so. It sounds a silly argument even to myself; I feel I have not got it quite right. Added to which {{it was not my}} partner who played the two of clubs, it was Dummy. If I had only remembered this, and had concluded from it--as I ought to have done--that my partner had the ace of diamonds--as otherwise why did he pass my knave?--we might have saved the odd trick. I have not the head for bridge. It is only an ordinary head--mine. I have no business to play bridge.|$|E

I prefer to be alone and silent. If I must talk, I like the English tongue least of all. Melanesia doesn't have such combinations of consonants and harsh sounds as our vernacular rejoices in. If I speak loud, as in preaching, I am pretty clear still; but I can't read at all properly now without real awkwardness.|$|E

Christie, you can never know how bitter hard it is to outlive a sin like mine, and struggle up again from such a fall. It clings to me; it won't be shaken off or buried out of sight.

It seems very cruel, very hard, yet it is my punishment, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> bear it, and begin again. What hurts me now more than all the rest, what breaks my heart, is that I deceived you. I never meant to do it. I did not seek you, did I?

6000|$|No writer {{worth his}} salt was ever {{satisfied}} with anything he ever wrote, so I have been told, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> believe. Evidently I am not worth my salt. Candid friends, and others, to whom in my salad days I used {{to show my}} work, asking for a frank opinion, meaning, of course, though never would they understand me, their unadulterated praise, would assure me for my good, that this, my first to whom the gods gave life, was but a feeble, ill-shaped child: its attempted early English a cross between [...] "The Pilgrim's Progress" [...] and [...] "Old Moore's Almanac;" [...] its scenery--which had cost me weeks of research--an apparent attempt to sum up {{in the language of}} a local guide book the leading characteristics of the Garden of Eden combined with Dante's Inferno; its pathos of the penny-plain and two-penny-coloured order. Maybe they were right. Much have I written since that at the time appeared to me good, that I have read later with regret, with burning cheek, with frowning brow. But of this, my first-born, the harbinger of all my hopes, I am no judge. Touching the yellowing, badly-printed pages, I feel again the deep thrill of joy with which I first unfolded them and read. Again I am a youngster, and life opens out before me--inmeasurable, no goal too high. This child of my brain, my work: it shall spread my name throughout the world. It shall be a household world in lands that I shall never see. Friends whose voices I shall never hear will speak of me. I shall die, but it shall live, yield fresh seed, bear fruit I know not of. Generations yet unborn shall read it and remember me. My thoughts, my words, my spirit: in it I shall live again; it shall keep my memory green.|$|E
