In the morning of 3 September 1939, while moored in a harbour, Gryf and Wicher were attacked by two German destroyers, Z1 Leberecht Maass and Z9 Wolfgang Zenker, firing at a range of 9 nautical miles. Polish warships and a shore battery repulsed the attack, with Gryf scoring two hits. After that the German squadron put up a <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> and withdrew. Later that day Wicher, still in harbour, repulsed two air raids. However, in the third attack at approximately 15:00 she was attacked by two groups of planes, and the German Luftwaffe scored four hits. Two bombs hit amidships, one hit the bow and the other was a close miss, yet managed to fracture the hull in several places on the starboard side. Wicher started to sink and the crew made it ashore, where they joined the land defence of Pomerania. One sailor was killed and 22 wounded in the air attack.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we build}} the {{relational}} models between {{the height of}} <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> and the flow of gas, the depth and mean temperature of smoke layer in critical value, respectively. These models {{are based on the}} analysis of gas flow in narrow space of <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> which is combined with the classic Hydraulic Jump model in the field of mechanics. For different initial conditions of gas, we simulate the effect of <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> height on flue gas flow via the fire dynamics simulation software FDS. The results show that: the air entrainment and the depth of smoke layer in critical value are decreasing constantly while the critical mean temperature of smoke layer is raising during the increasing of the height of <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier.</b> Thus, when it gets the zero value, the air entrainment and the depth of smoke layer in critical value will get the maximum and the critical mean temperature of smoke layer will get the minimum. And when the height of <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> greater than or equal the value of z_ 0, the value of air entrainment will be zero...|$|E

50|$|Smoke dampers are passive fire {{protection}} products used in air conditioning and ventilation ductwork or installed in physical <b>smoke</b> <b>barriers</b> (e.g., walls). This may be done {{to prevent the spread}} of smoke from the space of fire origin to other spaces in the same building. A combination of fans and dampers can exhaust smoke from an area while pressurizing the smoke-free areas around the affected area (inhibiting smoke infiltration into additional areas). may also be used to maintain the required concentration of a fire suppression clean agent in a space, as installed in supply air ducts to restrict the introduction of air into the space, and as installed in return or exhaust air ducts to restrict the depletion of the clean agent from the space. Smoke dampers are usually installed by sheet metal contractors.|$|R
50|$|Fire walls resist {{spread of}} fire within or {{sometimes}} between structures to provide passive fire protection. A {{delay in the}} spread of fire gives occupants more time to escape and fire fighters more time to extinguish the fire. Such walls have no windows, and are made of non-combustible material such as concrete, cement block, brick, or fire rated drywall—and have wall penetrations sealed with special materials. A doorway in a firewall must have a rated fire door. Fire walls provide varying resistance {{to the spread of}} fire, some intended to last one to four hours. Firewalls, generally, can also act as <b>smoke</b> <b>barriers</b> when constructed vertically from slab to roof deck and horizontally from an exterior wall to exterior wall subdividing a building into sections. When constructed in this manner the fire wall can also be referred to as an Area Separation Wall.|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the fire evacuation problem from the student dormitory by using the Numerical method. The Fire Dynamics Simulator Software was used in the research with the evacuation function (FDS + Evac.). The problem under investigation concerns the building that has the open-air centre. The characteristics of the building are included with 5 floors, 2 open-air fire escape stairs located at 2 sides of the building. In addition, there is a single exit to the outside of the building and the sprinkler system is not installed inside the building. Approach: The simulation was designed to study the problem that has a source of fire occurring at the room closed to the open-air stair. The stairs will be severely affected by the smoke. The experimentation's are composed of 4 cases, which are (1) the first case assumes the true size of the door is 1 m (2) the second case assumes the true size of the door is 1 m and the <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> is installed at the beam located before the stair entrance (3) the third case assumes the true size of the door is 2 m and (4) the fourth case assumes the true size of the door is 2 m and the <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> is installed. Results: The results are shown that the escape time from the building with the 1 m door is 465 sec and the 2 m door is 265 sec. The time differentiation between the 1 m door and the 2 m door is 200 sec. The reason is the waiting occurred at the entrance if the <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> is not installed. In this case, the smoke in the stairs without a <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> installation has more than the smoke in case if the <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> is installed. However, {{this research}} collected the data of the gas volume and found that the gas volume is not yet harmful to human life but the gas can be an obstacle to evacuation in the building that has an open-air centre. Conclusion: For safety reasons, the buildings user should improve the door size and install the <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> at 2 sides of the stairs for all floors to increase the evacuation ability...|$|E
40|$|A density jump {{occurs when}} the smoke flowing under the ceiling of a long {{corridor}} hits a <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier.</b> Additional air entrainment will increase the mass flow rates of hot smoke.

40|$|Many long {{corridors}} {{are built}} in underground public transport interchanges in downtown of big cities. Smoke control systems {{have to be}} installed in these long corridors. A density jump might occur when the smoke flowing under the ceiling hits a <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier.</b> High mass flow rates are then resulted due to additional air entrainment. In this paper, characteristic of density jump at <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> in long corridors, which are induced by horizontal smoke movement underneath the ceiling, will be studied by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} the Orange Grove Library in Gulfport, Mississippi, using prescriptive and performance-based techniques to evaluate fire and life safety. The prescriptive analysis is broken down into four components: alarm, egress, structural and suppression. Prescriptive codes are written by consensus, such that adhering to these codes will produce a reasonable balance between cost, function and safety. The performance-based design analysis uses analytical tools to predict how this particular building would perform under specific fire conditions, chosen based on the actual building in place. Life safety is the primary goal of this analysis. Achievement of this goal is measured by the ability of occupants to safely leave the building. This ability is quantified as the tenability criteria listed herein. The findings of the prescriptive analysis indicate that this building fails to meet the prescriptive code for certain egress components. The egress analysis has revealed several areas of non-compliance with the code requirements. Related to the Communicating Space, these include the lack of <b>smoke</b> <b>barriers,</b> an obstructed view from the second floor and an exit path through the communicating space. There should not be an exit through the receiving area. Also, the placement of the egress illumination and exit signs do not correspond to the exit paths. The performance-based design analysis also shows deficiencies in safety. FDS modeling shows that tenability due to loss of visibility begins to deteriorate very quickly, in under a minute for both fire sizes, 42 ̆ 7 x 42 ̆ 7 and 22 ̆ 7 x 22 ̆ 7. However, the other tenability criteria, carbon monoxide and temperature, are not nearly as dangerous in the first few minutes. The secondary goal for this analysis is to consider the preservation of property. Under most circumstances, the protection provided to the Secure Administrative Storage should be adequate to serve its function. Upon inspection of the library, several fire code violations were observed. These include a blocked exit, maintenance of illumination devices, storage in exit enclosures and storage in mechanical room. Proper operational control can be achieved through education and training of the staff. For this purpose, a fire prevention plan is included here in the appendix...|$|R

40|$|When {{evacuating}} through fire environments, {{the presence}} of smoke may not only have a physiological impact on the evacuees but may also lead occupants to adapt their evacuation strategy through the adoption of another exit. This paper attempts to introduce this type of adaptive behaviour within the buildingEXODUS evacuation model through enabling occupants to make decisions concerning {{the selection of the}} most viable available exit during an evacuation involving fire. The development of this adaptive behaviour requires the introduction of several new capabilities namely, the representation of the occupants’ familiarity with the structure, the behaviour of an occupant that is engulfed in smoke and the behaviour of an occupant that is faced with a <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier.</b> The appropriateness of the redirection decision is dependent upon behavioural data gathered from real fire incidents (in the UK and USA) that is used to construct the redirection probabilities.

40|$|This {{document}} is a Fire and Life Safety Report on the Taylor Place Dormitory located in Phoenix, Arizona {{as part of}} the Arizona State University (ASU) downtown campus. The building was evaluated on a prescriptive basis based on the current City of Phoenix building codes and further evaluated on using performance based methods from the Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE) Handbook and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 101 Life Safety Code®. These building features and systems were evaluated using prescriptive methods: General construction, fire resistive construction and fire resistive separations Occupancy, Life safety features and building egress Smoke management systems and features Fire protection systems, fire sprinkler, suppression systems, fire alarm Emergency and standby power, elevators, communication systems, and lighting A performance-based analysis of the South Tower and Ground Floor Cafeteria and Assembly space using NFPA 101 Life Safety Code® Chapter 5 as a guide. The analysis of the South Tower was based on NFPA 5. 5. 3. 1 and a typical fire for the occupancy accounting for occupants, number and location, room sizes, contents, fuel properties, ventilations, and identifying the location of the item ignited. The analysis of the Ground Floor Cafeteria and Assembly Area was based on NFPA 5. 5. 3. 2 and an ultra-fast fire in the primary means of egress reducing the overall means of egress by two double door exits. These scenarios are analyzed using tenability criteria to determine if with the given the design fire, all occupants can exit safely. Taylor Place generally meets or exceeds the prescriptive requirements for the system described above provided in the building code. Two specific areas were identified requiring further analysis: the corridor and two-story vertical opening separation is not provided in the South Tower per PBC Section 712, and the reduction in the door size of the south egress corridor on the ground floor. Both of these issues were addressed in conjunction with the performance based analysis and found to be acceptable with the current set of performance based recommendations. The performance-based analysis was largely successful. The analysis of the ground floor egress given an ultrafast fire located near the southwest corner of the assembly space found occupants Required Safe Egress Time (RSET) was greater than the Available Safe Egress Time (ASET) meaning all occupants egressed safely. The visibility was lost in the cafeteria which caused the failure of the tenability criteria and the determination of the ASET. The second analysis of the two-story vertical common area in the south tower failed the tenability criteria for visibility during the first two evaluations. It was determined that the two furniture standards {{as part of the}} ASU design guidelines varied greatly in fire behavior and smoke production. As a result, the furniture in the common areas meet the recommended requirements, the corridors will not require separation from the common area. As part of the evaluation process, there are additional recommendations in the report including the addition low level egress signage in the corridors to aid egress, a <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> in the entrance lobby, and the reasons are discussed in more detail in the report. Comments and recommendations {{can be found at the}} end of each section providing additional detail in specific areas. The end of the report focuses on Commissioning of fire protection and building systems. A team is needed to effectively test all of the fire protection systems in accordance with their performance requirements. Functional tests performed on each system to ensure each systems were installed correctly. For example, stair pressurization systems can rely on several fans to pressurize each stairwell. A functional test will typically quickly reveal problem areas and you may even find a motor running backwards. Valuable information is provided from this stage in the project to identify maintenance requirements and finalize documentation. Fire fighter operation overviews need to be assembled, operation and maintenance manuals need to be created for building staff, and fire safety plans need to be implemented. It is very much a documentation and punch list phase of the project...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Evacuation of the World Trade Center (WTC) {{twin towers}} and {{surrounding}} buildings damaged in the September 11, 2001 attacks provides {{a unique opportunity}} to study factors that affect emergency evacuation of high rise buildings. Problem The goal {{of this study is to}} understand the extent to which structural and behavioral barriers and limitations of personal mobility affected evacuation by occupants of affected buildings on September 11, 2001. Methods This analysis included 5, 023 civilian, adult enrollees within the World Trade Center Health Registry who evacuated the two World Trade Center towers and over 30 other Lower Manhattan buildings that were damaged or destroyed on September 11, 2001. Multinomial logistic regression was used to predict total evacuation time (less than 30 to ≤ 60 minutes, greater than 1 hour to less than 2 hours relative to ≤ 30 minutes) in relation to number of infrastructure barriers and number of behavioral barriers, adjusted for demographic and other factors. Results A higher percentage of evacuees reported encountering at least one behavioral barrier (84. 9 %) than reported at least one infrastructure barrier (51. 9 %). This pattern was consistent in all buildings except WTC 1, the first building attacked, where greater than 90 % of evacuees reported encountering both types of <b>barriers.</b> <b>Smoke</b> and poor lighting were the most frequently-reported structural barriers. Extreme crowding, lack of communication with officials, and being surrounded by panicked crowds were the most frequently-reported behavioral barriers. Multivariate analyses showed evacuation time to be independently associated with the number of each type of barrier as well as gender (longer times for women), but not with the floor from which evacuation began. After adjustment, personal mobility impairment was not associated with increased evacuation time. Conclusion Because most high-rise buildings have unique designs, infrastructure factors tend to be less predictable than behavioral factors, but both need to be considered in developing emergency evacuation plans in order to decrease evacuation time and, consequently, risk of injury and death during an emergency evacuation...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} report {{discusses the}} fire and life safety factors for the Orfalea College of Business Building located on the main campus of California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. The building functions are primarily administrative and academic in nature, with various lecture halls, offices, and labs located throughout the building. The Business Building was constructed in 1989 following the 1985 Uniform Building Code (UBC). For {{the purposes of this}} report, the building will be evaluated using the 2015 International Building Code, NFPA Life Safety Code Handbook (Thirteenth Edition), SFPE Handbook (4 th and 5 th Editions), and the NFPA handbooks relevant to each individual section. The prescriptive fire safety features that will be examined in the building will be divided into categories including egress analysis, fire detection, alarm and communication systems, water based fire suppression, structural fire protection, and tenability. The performance-based design of the building will be carried out with the goals outlined in the Life Safety Code (13 th edition) including ASET 3 ̆eRSET with minimal loss of life and property damage. The performance criteria of the FDS model will be based on methods 1 and 2 for performance-based design outlined in the LSC Handbook (13 th edition) The performance-based design will be carried out using Pathfinder and FDS to simulate a design fire that was selected to reflect a serious threat to the occupants in the building Following the performance based design criteria outlined in methods 1 and 2 of the LSC (13 th edition), the proposed design fire ensures that incapacitation does not occur, however visibility is lost. This satisfies method 1 of the performance based design which states that no occupant shall be incapacitated by the effects of fire for the duration required for the required safe egress time. Method 2 of the design fails because this performance goal is to ensure that the toxic gas layer does not fall below 6 feet at any point during the simulation. In order to maintain the functionality of <b>smoke</b> doors and <b>barriers,</b> doors that are not designed to be help open should be kept closed. Hallway obstructions on the third and fourth floors should be removed to ensure a clear egress route. If complete coverage of smoke detectors is a safety goal of the building, smaller offices should install smoke detection devices. Foliage between the Business and Education should be removed to maintain a safe exterior exposure separation...|$|R
40|$|This fire {{protection}} and life safety analysis is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the Master of Science Degree from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. The study {{was performed on the}} University of Southern California’s Heritage Hall, which includes both a code-determined prescriptive examination and a performance-based analysis. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the Heritage Hall address based on compliance with all applicable codes and standards, as well as the determined occupant tenability criteria. The prescriptive examination of Heritage Hall consisted of the evaluation of all structural {{fire protection}}, egress analysis and design, water-based fire suppression, and fire alarm systems. This analysis was primarily performed by utilizing the 2013 edition of California Building Code and the 2013 editions of all applicable NFPA codes and standards. The structural fire protection overview provided an in-depth prescriptive analysis of the conversions made for Heritage Hall during the 2012 renovation project. The latest recapitalization expanded the lower level and added more spaces for student athletes, thus converting those locations to the A- 3 occupancy classification. Per CBC Table 601, non-bearing walls and partitions were not required to be fire-rated. The structural update complied with all updated building codes due to a water curtain installed per Section 404. 6 of the CBC, which allowed the center museum’s atrium not to be separated by a 1 -hour fire barrier. Instead, both glass walls surrounding the atrium were used to create smoke partitions to meet standards. The egress analysis and design was utilized to determine new occupant loads for each floor, remove the B- 2 occupancy classification, {{the creation of a new}} area of refuge. Per CBC Table 1018. 1, corridor walls and ceilings were not required to be fire resistance rated due to the building being fully sprinklered. Only the area of refuge at the lower level was provided with a 1 -hour fire rated separation, and existing 1 -hour separations, such as the lower level’s exit access corridor, remained intact. Using the Life Safety Code, a building evacuation analysis was performed at Heritage Hall’s lower level. The average evacuation time of all lower level occupants was determined to be 5. 43 minutes, with a range of 2. 74 - 8. 13 minutes depending on whether occupants used the exit corridor or the stairways. All egress components and occupancy classification were deemed acceptable. The water-based suppression analysis was performed by primarily using NFPA 13 and NFPA 25 codes and standards. A complete analysis of the building’s risers, sprinklers, and system demand calculations provided acceptable criteria for the water-based fire protection system installed. The outside overhang was chosen not to have sprinklers installed due to the large amount of remaining asbestos at the interstitial level near the ceiling. The overhang is made of concrete and directly exposed to the outside. The building’s fire alarm system was installed in 2012, with all new fire detection devices, notification appliances, fire alarm control panel, and a mass notification system. The fire alarm system design was analyzed using NFPA 72, with all spacing and location requirements deemed acceptable for the devices installed. All spot-type smoke and heat detectors are ceiling-mounted in accordance with the open ceiling plan at the lower level, which contains both ceiling and wall-mounted sprinklers. The performance-based analysis was performed using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), a fire modeling program provided by NIST, and the SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering. Two unique design fire performance scenarios were established for Heritage Hall: a workstation fire in the first floor atrium and a stacked-chairs fire near the lower level exit corridor that prevents its use. In order to establish a basis for analysis and comparison, various tenability criteria were determined for the building’s occupants. The performance criteria consisted of visibility, toxicity, and tenability requirements for the facility, which were compared with modeling simulations created using FDS. The simulations allowed for the determination of the available safe egress time (ASET). Occupant behavior and characteristics were paired with Thunderhead Engineering’s Pathfinder program to provide a required set egress time (RSET) for each fire scenario. While the lower level corridor fire scenario met all tenability requirements, the atrium’s fire scenario simulation did not provide an acceptable ASET, and therefore did not pass the critical occupant visibility requirements for safe evacuation. Recommendations were provided to establish a legitimate <b>smoke</b> <b>barrier</b> per CBC Section 404. 6, or an appropriate door separation for each side entrance to the atrium per CBC Section 715. 1...|$|E
