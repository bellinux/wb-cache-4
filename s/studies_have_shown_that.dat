5|$|Family Daubentoniidae {{contains}} only one surviving species, of the aye-aye. Wide-ranging genetic <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> it {{separated from the}} ancestral lemurs long before any other branch of the modern Lemuriformes.|$|E
5|$|For {{antioxidant}} therapy, <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> reactive oxidative species lead to {{the formation}} of multiple sclerosis lesions in which antioxidants can help induce neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. Probably the most clear disease modifying factor (for worse) is smoking, and therefore to quit smoking should be considered.|$|E
5|$|Numerical <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> over {{millions}} of years, the general nature of the alignment between the orbits of Pluto and Neptune does not change. There are several other resonances and interactions that enhance Pluto's stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).|$|E

5|$|Paleoenvironmental <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> organic {{material}} began to accumulate on the Blackdown Hills in the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods with areas of open meadow, grass land with small woodland components being identified. There are several Bronze Age burial sites including Robin Hood's Butts near Otterford.|$|E
5|$|Sponges were {{traditionally}} {{distributed in}} three classes: calcareous sponges (Calcarea), glass sponges (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae). However, <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the Homoscleromorpha, a group thought {{to belong to}} the Demospongiae, is actually phylogenetically well separated. Therefore, they have recently been recognized as the fourth class of sponges.|$|E
5|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> SCSFLS runs in {{families}} {{and it is}} suspected that genetic similarity {{in families}} includes weakness in the dura mater, which leads to SCSFLS. Large scale population-based studies {{have not yet been}} conducted. While a majority of SCSFLS cases continue to be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, an actual increase in occurrence is unlikely.|$|E

5|$|Terri Schiavo died at a Pinellas Park hospice on March 31, 2005. Although {{there was}} concern that Schiavo would {{experience}} significant symptoms from dehydration with {{the removal of the}} feeding tube, <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> patients who have their feeding tubes removed, such as the case of Schiavo, usually have a peaceful death.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males {{that attempt to}} monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals. Female selection however, {{has been shown to}} help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E
5|$|Financial markets on the {{continent}} {{are expected to be}} far more liquid and flexible {{than they were in the}} past. The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone. However, although transaction costs were reduced, some <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> risk aversion has increased during the last 40 years in the Eurozone.|$|E

5|$|Molecular <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> {{the current}} species concept for H.repandum may need {{revision}} {{as there is}} a poor overlap between morphological and molecular species concepts. Phylogenetic analysis of European specimens, based on internal transcribed spacer and 5.8S DNA sequences, indicates that H.repandum specimens form two distinct clades, whose only consistent morphological distinction is cap size. These genetic differences may indicate the presence of undescribed cryptic species, and that the taxon may currently be undergoing intensive speciation.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, cheetahs {{are poor}} breeders in captivity, while wild {{individuals}} {{are far more}} successful. In a 1992 study, females in Serengeti {{were found to have}} 95% success rate in breeding. In contrast, only 20% of the North American captive cheetahs bred successfully in 1991. <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> in-vitro fertilisation in cheetah poses more difficulties than are faced in the case of other cats.|$|E
5|$|Non-septic prepatellar {{bursitis}} can {{be treated}} with rest, the application of ice to the affected area, and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen. Elevation of the affected leg during rest may also expedite the recovery process. Severe cases may require fine-needle aspiration of the bursa fluid, sometimes coupled with cortisone injections. However, some <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> steroid injections {{may not be an}} effective treatment option. After the bursitis has been treated, rehabilitative exercise may help improve joint mechanics and reduce chronic pain.|$|E
50|$|A 2004 <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> Aplysiidae is a {{monophyletic}} taxon {{with two}} distinct clades: Aplysiinae and Dolabellinae + Dolabriferinae + Notarchinae.|$|R

5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case {{it may be difficult}} to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E
5|$|The RLN may be {{compressed}} by tumors. <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> 218% of {{lung cancer}} patients develop hoarseness because of recurrent laryngeal nerve compression, usually left-sided. This is associated with worse outcomes, and when found as a presenting symptom, often indicates inoperable tumors. The nerve may be severed intentionally during lung cancer surgery in order to fully remove a tumor.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Tourette's is unknown, {{but it is}} well {{established}} that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. Genetic epidemiology <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> {{the overwhelming majority of}} cases of Tourette's are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known and no gene has been identified. In other cases, tics are associated with disorders other than Tourette's, a phenomenon known as tourettism.|$|E

5|$|The {{exact number}} of cases of HIT in the general {{population}} is unknown. What is known is that women receiving heparin after a recent surgical procedure, particularly cardiothoracic surgery, have a higher risk, while the risk is very low in women just before and after giving birth. Some <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> HIT is less common in those receiving low molecular weight heparin.|$|E
5|$|Various {{species are}} known to feed on dead {{arthropods}} (scavenging), web silk, and their own shed exoskeletons. Pollen caught in webs may also be eaten, and <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> young spiders {{have a better chance}} of survival if they have the opportunity to eat pollen. In captivity, several spider species are also known to feed on bananas, marmalade, milk, egg yolk and sausages.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
