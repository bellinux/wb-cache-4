50|$|Deficiencies in β-glucuronidase {{result in}} the non {{recessive}} inherited metabolic disease known as <b>Sly</b> <b>syndrome</b> or Mucopolysaccharidosis VII. A deficiency in this enzyme results in the build-up of non-hydrolyzed mucopolysaccharides in the patient. This disease can be extremely debilitating for the patient or can result in hydrops fetalis prior to birth. In addition, mental retardation, short stature, coarse facial features, spinal abnormalities, and enlargement of liver and spleen are observed in surviving patients. This disease has been modeled in a strain of mice {{as well as a}} family of dogs. More recently researchers have discovered a feline family that exhibits deficiencies in β-glucuronidase activity. The source of this reduction of activity has been identified as an E351K mutation (Glu351 is mutated to a lysine residue). Glu351 is conserved in mammalian species, which suggests an important function for this residue. Examination of the human X-ray crystal structure suggests that this residue (Glu352 in the human enzyme), which is buried deep within the TIM barrel domain, may be important for stabilization of the tertiary structure of the enzyme. In the crystal structure, it appears that Arg216, a member of the jelly roll domain of the protein, forms a salt bridge with Glu352; therefore, Glu352 is likely involved in stabilizing the interaction between two different three-dimensional domains of the enzyme.|$|E

In 7 additional patients a metabolic disorder (phenylketonuria (n = 5), mucopolysaccharidosis type III (Sanfilippo syndrome, type A) (n = 1) and mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (<b>Sly</b> <b>syndrome)</b> (n = 1)) was diagnosed in the past. The abnormal metabolic findings in this group of 313 patients were classified in three categories and the clinical findings are reported: 1. metabolic disorders {{as the cause of}} mental retardation (MR), 2. metabolic disorders not explaining the MR, and 3. metabolic abnormalities of unknown significance. The first two groups included 16 patients, i. e. 26. 2 % of the group of monogenic disorders and 3. 4 % of the total population: phenylketonuria (PKU) (n = 5), S-sulfocysteinuria (n = 3), mucopolysaccharidosis type III (Sanfilippo syndrome, type A) (n = 1) and Gm 1 -gangliosidosis type 3 (n = 1) (first group), and mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (<b>Sly</b> <b>syndrome)</b> (n = 1), Niemann-Pick syndrome, type B (n = 1), cystinuria (n = 1) and hyperprolinemia type 1 (n = 3) (second group).

40|$|Better {{understanding}} of disease pathophysiology, improved supportive care {{and availability of}} disease-specific treatments {{for some of the}} mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) disorders have greatly improved the outlook for patients with MPS disorders. Optimal management of these multisystemic disorders involves a multidisciplinary team and regular, comprehensive follow-up. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is now available for MPS I (Hurler, Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndromes) (laronidase), MPS II (Hunter syndrome) (idursulfase) and MPS VI Maroteaux-Lamy (galsulfase), and is in development for MPS IV (Morquio syndrome) and MPS VII (<b>Sly</b> <b>syndrome).</b> Benefits of ERT can include improved walking ability, improved respiration and enhanced quality of life.

40|$|We {{recently}} {{described a}} murine model for mucopolysaccharidosis VII in mice {{that have an}} inherited deficiency of beta-glucuronidase (beta-D-glucuronoside glucuronosohydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 31). Affected mice, of genotype gusmps/gusmps, present clinical manifestations {{similar to those of}} humans with mucopolysaccharidosis VII (<b>Sly</b> <b>syndrome)</b> and are shown here to have secondary elevations of other lysosomal enzymes. The mucopolysaccharidosis VII phenotype in both species includes dwarfism, skeletal deformities, and premature death. Lysosome storage is visualized within enlarge vesicles and correlates biochemically with accumulation of undegraded and partially degraded glycosaminoglycans. In this report we describe the consequences of introducing the human beta-glucuronidase gene, GUSB, into gusmps/gusmps mice that produce virtually no murine beta-glucuronidase. Transgenic mice homozygous for the mucopolysaccharidosis VII mutation expressed high levels of human beta-glucuronidase activity in all tissues examined and were phenotypically normal. Biochemically, both the intralysosomal storage of glycosaminoglycans and the secondary elevation of other acid hydrolases were corrected. These findings demonstrate that the GUSB transgene is expressed in gusmps/gusmps mice and that human beta-glucuronidase corrects the murine mucopolysaccharidosis storage disease...|$|E

Lysosomal storage in neurons of the brain and the associated behavioral abnormalities characteristic of a murine model of MPS VII have not been shown to be corrected by either bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy. However, intravenous injections of recombinant beta-glucuronidase initiated at birth reduce the pathological evidence of disease in MPS VII mice. In this study we present evidence that enzyme replacement initiated at birth improved the behavioral performance and reduced hearing loss in MPS VII mice. Enzyme-treated MPS VII mice performed similarly to normal mice and significantly better than mock- treated MPS VII mice in every phase of the Morris Water Maze test. In addition, the auditory function of treated MPS VII mice was dramatically improved, and was indistinguishable from normal mice. These data indicate that some of the learning, memory, and hearing deficits can be prevented in MPS VII mice if enzyme replacement therapy is initiated early in life. These data also provide functional correlates to the biochemical and histopathological improvements observed after enzyme replacement therapy...|$|E
40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII; <b>Sly</b> <b>syndrome)</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive lysosomal storage disorder {{due to an}} inherited deficiency of β-glucuronidase. A naturally occurring mouse model for this disease was discovered at The Jackson Laboratory and shown {{to be due to}} homozygosity for a 1 -bp deletion in exon 10 of the gus gene. The murine model MPS VII (gusmps/mps) has been very well characterized and used extensively to evaluate experimental strategies for lysosomal storage diseases, including bone marrow transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy, and gene therapy. To enhance the value of this model for enzyme and gene therapy, we produced a transgenic mouse expressing the human β-glucuronidase cDNA with an amino acid substitution at the active site nucleophile (E 540 A) and bred it onto the MPS VII (gusmps/mps) background. We demonstrate here that the mutant mice bearing the active site mutant human transgene retain the clinical, morphological, biochemical, and histopathological characteristics of the original MPS VII (gusmps/mps) mouse. However, they are now tolerant to immune challenge with human β-glucuronidase.

40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (<b>Sly</b> <b>syndrome)</b> is a {{lysosomal}} {{storage disease}} caused by inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme β-glucuronidase. A murine model of this disorder {{has been well}} characterized and used to study a number of forms of experimental therapies, including gene therapy. We produced recombinant adenovirus that expresses human β-glucuronidase and administered this recombinant adenovirus to β-glucuronidase-deficient mice intravenously. The β-glucuronidase activities in liver and spleen were elevated to 40 % and 20 %, respectively, of the heterozygote enzymatic level at day 16. Expression persisted for at least 35 days. Pathological abnormalities of these tissues were also improved, and the elevated levels of urinary glycosaminoglycans were reduced in treated mice. However, the β-glucuronidase activity in kidney and brain was not significantly increased. After administration of the recombinant adenovirus directly into the lateral ventricles of mutant mice, the β-glucuronidase activity in crude brain homogenates increased to 30 % of heterozygote activity. Histochemical demonstration of β-glucuronidase activity in brain revealed that the enzymatic activity was mainly in ependymal cells and choroid. However, in some regions, the adenovirus-mediated gene expression was also evident in brain parenchyma associated with vessels and in the meninges. These results suggest that adenovirus-mediated gene delivery might improve {{the central nervous system}} pathology of mucopolysaccharidosis in addition to correcting visceral pathology...|$|E
40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII, <b>Sly</b> <b>syndrome)</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by b-glucuronidase (GUS) deficiency. A naturally occurring mouse model of that disease {{has been very}} useful for studying experimental approaches to therapy. However, immune responses can complicate evaluation of the long-term benefits of enzyme replacement or gene therapy delivered to adult MPS VII mice. To make this model useful for studying the long-term effectiveness and side effects of experimental therapies delivered to adult mice, we developed a new MPS VII mouse model, which is tolerant to both human and murine GUS. To achieve this, we used homologous recombination to introduce simultaneously a human cDNA transgene expressing inactive human GUS into intron 9 of the murine Gus gene and a targeted active site mutation (E 536 A) into the adjacent exon 10. When the heterozygote products of germline transmission were bred to homozygosity, the homozygous mice expressed no GUS enzyme activity but expressed inactive human GUS protein highly and were tolerant to immune challenge with human enzyme. Expression of the mutant murine Gus gene was reduced to about 10 % of normal levels, but the inactive murine GUS enzyme also conferred tolerance to murine GUS. This MPS VII mouse model should be useful to evaluate therapeutic responses in adult mice receiving repetitive doses of enzyme or mice receiving gene therapy as adults.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{manifestations of}} {{lysosomal}} storage disease (LSD) {{are a significant}} health problem for affected patients. Infantileonset cardiac disease, because of its rapid progression, is usually treated symptomatically. Therapy in older patients includes valve replacement and bone marrow (BM) transplantation, {{both of which are}} life threatening in the already debilitated patients. Enzyme replacement therapy has potential benefit but has not yet been demonstrated to provide long-term relief for cardiac disease. Here, we demonstrate prevention of severe cardiac manifestations in β-glucuronidase (GUSB) null mice BM-transplanted i. v. as neonates without myeloablative pretreatment. The mice, a model of mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPSVII, <b>Sly</b> <b>syndrome),</b> develop progressive LSD unless provided with GUSB early in life. The BM recipients retained GUSB+ donor cells in the peripheral blood and heart until necropsy at > 11 months of age. The enzyme β-hexosamindase increased in tissues of GUSB null MPSVII mice was reduced significantly (P = 0. 001) in treated MPSVII hearts. Electrocardiography demonstrated normalization of heart rate, PR, PQ, and QRS intervals in BM recipients. Storage was markedly reduced in the stroma of heart valves, adventitial cells of the aortic root, perivascular and interstitial cells of the myocardium, and interstitial cells of the conduction tissue. Heart/body weight ratio normalized. The aortic root was still grossly distended, and the conductive myocytes retained storage, suggesting neither {{plays a major role in}} ECG normalization.

40|$|Human {{mucopolysaccharidosis}} VII (MPS VII, <b>Sly</b> <b>syndrome)</b> {{results from}} a deficiency of β-glucuronidase (GUS) and {{has been associated with}} a wide range in severity of clinical manifestations. To study missense mutant models of murine MPS VII with phenotypes of varying severity, we used targeted mutagenesis to produce E 536 A and E 536 Q, corresponding to active-site nucleophile replacements E 540 A and E 540 Q in human GUS, and L 175 F, corresponding to the most common human mutation, L 176 F. The E 536 A mouse had no GUS activity in any tissue and displayed a severe phenotype like that of the originally described MPS VII mice carrying a deletion mutation (gusmps/mps). E 536 Q and L 175 F mice had low levels of residual activity and milder phenotypes. All three mutant MPS models showed progressive lysosomal storage in many tissues but had different rates of accumulation. The amount of urinary glycosaminoglycan excretion paralleled the clinical severity, with urinary glycosaminoglycans remarkably higher in E 536 A mice than in E 536 Q or L 175 F mice. Molecular analysis showed that the Gus mRNA levels were quantitatively similar in the three mutant mouse strains and normal mice. These mouse models, which mimic different clinical phenotypes of human MPS VII, should be useful in studying pathogenesis and also provide useful models for studying enzyme replacement therapy and targeted correction of missense mutations...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Deficiencies in enzymes {{involved}} in proteoglycan (PG) turnover underlie {{a number of}} rare mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), investigations of which can considerably aid understanding of the roles of PGs in corneal matrix biology. Here, the authors analyze novel pathologic changes in MPS VII (<b>Sly</b> <b>syndrome)</b> to determine the nature of PG-collagen associations in stromal ultrastructure. Methods. Transmission electron microscopy and electron tomography were used to investigate PG-collagen architectures and interactions in a cornea obtained at keratoplasty from a 22 -year-old man with MPS VII, which {{was caused by a}} compound heterozygous mutation in the GUSB gene. Results. Transmission electron microscopy showed atypical morphology of the epithelial basement membrane and Bowman's layer in MPS VII. Keratocytes were packed with cytoplasmic vacuoles containing abnormal glycosaminoglycan (GAG) material, and collagen fibrils were thinner than in normal cornea and varied considerably throughout anterior (14 – 32 nm), mid (13 – 42 nm), and posterior (17 – 39 nm) regions of the MPS VII stroma. PGs viewed in three dimensions were striking in appearance in that they were significantly larger than PGs in normal cornea and formed highly extended linkages with multiple collagen fibrils. Conclusions. Cellular changes in the MPS VII cornea resemble those in other MPS. However, the wide range of collagen fibril diameters throughout the stroma and the extensive matrix presence of supranormal-sized PG structures appear to be unique features of this disorder. The findings suggest that the accumulation of stromal chondroitin-, dermatan-, and heparan-sulfate glycosaminoglycans in the absence of β-glucuronidase-mediated degradation can modulate collagen fibrillogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{severity}} of human mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII), or <b>Sly</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{depends on the}} relative activity of the enzyme β-glucuronidase. Loss of β-glucuronidase activity can cause hydrops fetalis, with in utero or postnatal death of the patient. In this report, we show that β-glucuronidase activity is not detectable by a standard fluorometric assay in C 3 H/HeOuJ (C 3 H) mice homozygous for a new mutation, gusmps 2 J. These gusmps 2 J/gusmps 2 J mice are born and survive much longer than the previously characterized β-glucuronidase-null B 6. C-H- 2 bm 1 /ByBir-gusmps (gusmps/gusmps) mice. Northern blot analysis of liver from gusmps 2 J/gusmps 2 J mice demonstrates a 750 -bp reduction in size of β-glucuronidase mRNA. A 5. 4 -kb insertion in the Gus-sh nucleotide sequence from these mice was localized by Southern blot analysis to intron 8. The ends of the inserted sequences were cloned by inverse PCR and revealed an intracisternal A-particle (IAP) element inserted near the 3 ′ end of the intron. The sequence of the long terminal repeat (LTR) regions of the IAP most closely matches that of a composite LTR found in transposed IAPs previously identified in the C 3 H strain. The inserted IAP may contribute to diminished β-glucuronidase activity either by interfering with transcription or by destabilizing the message. The resulting phenotype is much less severe than that previously described in the gusmps/gusmps mouse and provides an opportunity to study MPS VII on a genetic background that clearly modulates disease severity...|$|E
