In the 1989 general election, Daley faced Republican candidate Edward Vrdolyak, {{a former}} Democratic alderman who had opposed Mayor Washington, and Alderman Timothy C.

After winning the general election on April 4, 1989, Daley was inaugurated as Mayor of Chicago on April 24, 1989, his 47th birthday, at a ceremony in Orchestra Hall.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer and {{his wife}} were both Republicans in the 1940s. After {{witnessing}} political corruption and voter fraud in their own ward and around the city, they became disillusioned with the party organization in the city and joined the reform effort led by Joseph S. Clark, Jr., and Richardson Dilworth. Clark and Dilworth brought together Democrats, independents, and disaffected Republicans like <b>Sawyer</b> <b>in</b> a coalition against the Republican political machine, which they regarded as irredeemably corrupt. In 1949, Sawyer served as a Democratic committeeman and Clark and Dilworth won city offices that year.|$|E
5|$|The general {{success of}} William L. Mayo and his college even {{inflamed}} {{the passions of}} their competitors, most especially T. Henry Bridges, the head of Henry College in nearby Campbell. According to William E. <b>Sawyer,</b> <b>in</b> the aftermath of Reconstruction the Southern-educated Bridges viewed the Northern-educated Mayo as a carpetbagger. After a battle of words between the two college presidents in local newspaper columns, on August 24, 1896, Bridges drove into Commerce in his buggy to confront Mayo, first asking him to sign a statement retracting his written claims. When Mayo refused, Bridges drew his revolver on Mayo, and after he missed his target twice, Bridges proceeded to strike Mayo with 15 to 20 lashes of his whip. The disturbance attracted an angry mob of ETNC students, who drove Bridges out of town. Bridges' Henry College would ultimately become defunct in 1901.|$|E

25|$|The sloop was {{formally}} recommissioned in May 1758, under Commander Herbert <b>Sawyer,</b> <b>in</b> the months preceding {{the outbreak of}} the Seven Years' War. In July 1759 she was assigned to support the press gang in rounding up potential naval crews from among the population of Bristol; control of the vessel for this purpose was temporarily granted to Commander Thomas Francis. After six months at this task, Happy was returned to traditional navy duties as a privateer hunter under Commander Sir Thomas Adams. She was surveyed for potential repairs in February 1760, but found to be seaworthy.|$|E
25|$|Though {{technically}} {{not part}} of two-wheel ("bicycle") history, the intervening decades of the 1820s-1850s witnessed many developments concerning human-powered vehicles often using technologies similar to the draisine, even if {{the idea of a}} workable two-wheel design, requiring the rider to balance, had been dismissed. These new machines had three wheels (tricycles) or four (quadracycles) and came in a very wide variety of designs, using pedals, treadles, and hand-cranks, but these designs often suffered from high weight and high rolling resistance. However, Willard <b>Sawyer</b> <b>in</b> Dover successfully manufactured a range of treadle-operated 4-wheel vehicles and exported them worldwide in the 1850s.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{had already}} begun on the third project, called the Stetson-Sawyer project, when {{economic}} uncertainty stemming from the 2007 financial crisis led to its delay. College trustees initially balked at the Stetson-Sawyer project's cost, and revisited the idea of renovating <b>Sawyer</b> <b>in</b> its current location, an idea which proved not to be cost-effective. The entire project includes construction of two new academic buildings, the removal of Sawyer Library from its current location, {{and the construction of}} a new library at the rear of a renovated Stetson Hall (which served as the college library prior to Sawyer's construction). The academic buildings, temporarily named North Academic Building and South Academic Building, were completed in fall of 2008. In the spring of 2009, South Academic Building was renamed Schapiro Hall in honor of former President Morton O. Schapiro. In the spring of 2010 the North Academic Building was renamed Hollander Hall. Construction of the new Sawyer Library was completed in 2014, after which the old Sawyer Library was razed.|$|E

25|$|In 1937, Robinson {{caused a}} stir in the Harlem {{community}} by choosing a white dancer, Geneva Sawyer, as his dance partner over Jeni Le Gon in the Twentieth Century Fox film Caf√© Metropole (1937). LeGon had danced with him in Hooray for Love (1935) and had received favorable reviews. Sawyer had been Shirley Temple's dance coach during the time Temple and Robinson made movies together, and Sawyer had taken tap lessons from Robinson while he was teaching Temple and choreographing her routines. Robinson suggested to the producers that Sawyer could be cast as his partner if she wore blackface. Le Gon's career suffered as a result, and she never worked with Robinson again. Ironically, although the scene was shot with <b>Sawyer</b> <b>in</b> blackface, the studio became convinced that a mixed-race adult couple dancing together would be too controversial: both scenes with Robinson were cut from {{the final version of}} the movie and the deleted scenes were only released in 2008 as part of a Fox DVD boxed set of Tyrone Power movies.|$|E

[...] Jenner cross-dressed {{for many years and}} took hormone replacement therapy but stopped after her romance with Kris Kardashian became more serious, leading to marriage in 1992. Jenner recounts having permission to explore her gender identity on her own travels but not when they were coupled, and that not knowing the best way to talk about the many issues contributed to the deterioration of the 23-year-long marriage, which ended formally in 2015.|$|E
500|$|A main {{theme of}} the episode is Kate's {{inability}} to commit to other people, always running from difficult emotional situations, and having barriers {{between her and her}} interests ‚Äì physical, as in Sawyer's cage or Jack's aquarium, or metaphorical, as in her inability to settle down as Kevin's wife. Kate's marriage, which was first alluded in the season one episode [...] "Outlaws", is meant to be a contrast with her relationship with <b>Sawyer</b> <b>in</b> the realtime events ‚Äì Kate and Kevin is a heartfelt and passionate relationship where Kate tries to get involved but her lifestyle ends up on making the marriage fail, whereas with Sawyer both are afraid of intimacy and connection yet still end up together.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Dinklage co-starred with Vin Diesel in Find Me Guilty, a {{courtroom}} drama directed by Sidney Lumet. The film tells {{the true story}} of the longest Mafia trial in American history; Dinklage played Ben Klandis, the lead defense attorney. Critical reaction to the film was mostly positive, though it was a commercial failure. Writing for Chicago Sun-Times, film critic Roger Ebert praised Dinklage's performance, saying that the character he plays stands apart as [...] "concise, articulate and professional". The same year, he portrayed the character Marlowe <b>Sawyer</b> <b>in</b> episodes of Nip/Tuck. He played a fictionalized version of himself in an episode of the HBO series Entourage and appeared in NBC's 30 Rock as Stuart. The same year, Dinklage appeared in the British romantic comedy Penelope playing Lemon, a tabloid reporter. The film received mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
500|$|Like {{his father}} and grandfather, several of Johnson's other (non-blood) {{relatives}} are or were professional wrestlers, including his uncles, Afa and Sika Anoa ªi (The Wild Samoans) and his cousins, Rodney (Yokozuna), Solofa (Rikishi), Matt (Rosey) [...] and Eddie (Umaga). When Johnson declared his intent to become a wrestler, his father initially resisted, but then agreed to train him himself, warning {{that he would not}} go easy on him. Veteran wrestler Pat Patterson got Johnson several tryout matches with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1996. Under his real name, he defeated The Brooklyn Brawler at a house show and lost the other matches to Chris Candido and Owen Hart. After wrestling at Jerry Lawler's United States Wrestling Association as Flex Kavana and winning the USWA World Tag Team Championship twice with Bart <b>Sawyer</b> <b>in</b> the summer of 1996, Johnson signed a WWF contract. He received additional training from Tom Prichard, alongside Achim Albrecht and Mark Henry.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there is}} no extant music that can be {{positively}} identified with Nero, {{there is a possibility}} that some of it may have been used in later works. John E. <b>Sawyer,</b> <b>in</b> his analysis of Agrippina, reveals that this work, composed five years after Nero with similar characters, [...] "contains the highest proportion of borrowed material of any of the composer's major dramatic works", and Dean and Knapp speculate as to whether it also incorporates borrowings from Nero. According to the Handel scholar Charles Cudworth, the suite of dances that follows the overture to Handel's 1707 opera Rodrigo (his first after leaving Hamburg), could very well have begun as ballet music in Nero or another of the lost Hamburg operas. The musicologist Bernd Baselt has raised the possibility that Handel's Harpsichord Suite in G Minor, HWV 453, is an arrangement of the overture to Nero. A version of this suite, reconstructed for orchestra by Peter Holman, is included in a selection of Handel's Hamburg music, issued by Hyperion Records in January 2012.|$|E
