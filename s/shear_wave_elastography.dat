5000|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} a method named Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI) for mapping tissue {{elasticity}} has been proposed. The method {{is based on}} the use of acoustic radiation force of focused ultrasound to create shear waves in soft tissue. By measuring shear wave propagation parameters using ultrasound or MRI the tissue elasticity map can be created. Since the terms [...] "Elasticity Imaging" [...] and [...] "Elastography" [...] are synonyms, the original term SWEI is often changed to SWE, which commonly stands for <b>Shear</b> <b>Wave</b> <b>Elastography.</b> The shear wave speed is governed by the shear modulus of tissue which is highly sensitive to physiological and pathological structural changes of tissue. Variation of the shear modulus may be several orders of magnitude depending on the structure and state of tissue. This variation of the shear wave speed increases in many tissues in the presence of disease, e.g. the cancerous tissues can be significantly stiffer than normal tissue. For this reason, the possibility of using shear waves in new diagnostic methods and devices has been extensively investigated over the last two decades.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to prospectively evaluate the use of point <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> for the assessment of liver fibrosis and to determine the usefulness and optimal location for obtaining elastography measurements in native and transplanted livers. Point <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> measurements were obtained from 100 consecutive patients presenting for percutaneous liver biopsy. Measurements were acquired within both the superior right hepatic lobe (segments VII/VIII) via an intercostal approach and the inferior right hepatic lobe (segments V/VI) via a subcostal approach. Analysis of variance was used to assess statistical differences between the degree of fibrosis on percutaneous liver biopsy and elastography measurements. No statistical difference was present when comparing elastography measurements in patients with hepatic steatosis compared with patients without steatosis (P = 0. 2759). There was no difference in the accuracy of elastography measurements in native livers versus transplanted livers (P = 0. 221). Point <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> can accurately differentiate between patients with no-to-mild hepatic fibrosis (F 0 –F 1) and moderate-to-severe hepatic fibrosis (>=F 2) with sensitivity of 72 % and specificity of 69 %. Point <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> can be used as a noninvasive method to assess fibrosis in patients with native or transplanted livers. In addition, measurements can be combined or taken separately from either the superior or inferior right hepatic lobe.

40|$|The {{presence}} of significant fibrosis is an indicator for liver disease staging and prognosis. The {{aim of the}} study was to determine reproducibility of real-time <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> using a hepatic biopsy as the reference standard to identify patients with chronic liver disease. Forty patients with chronic liver disease and 12 normal subjects received <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> performed by skilled operators. Interoperator reproducibility was studied in 29 patients. Fibrosis was evaluated using the Metavir score. The median and range <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> values in chronic liver disease subjects were 6. 15 kPa and 3. 14 - 16. 7 kPa and were 4. 49 kPa and 2. 92 - 7. 32 kPa in normal subjects, respectively. With respect to fibrosis detected by liver biopsy, <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> did not change significantly between F 0 and F 1 (p = 0. 334), F 1 and F 2 (p = 0. 611), or F 3 and F 4 (0. 327); a significant difference was observed between the F 0 -F 2 and F 3 -F 4 groups (p = 0. 002). SWE also correlated with inflammatory activity (Rs = 0. 443, p = 0. 0023) and ALT levels (Rs = 0. 287, p = 0. 0804). Age, sex and body mass index did not affect <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> measurements. Using receiver operator characteristic curves, two threshold values for <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> were identified: 5. 62 kPa for patients with fibrosis (≥F 2; sensitivity 80 %, specificity 69. 4 %, and accuracy 77 %) and 7. 04 kPa for patients with severe fibrosis (≥F 3; sensitivity 88. 9 %, specificity 81 %, and accuracy 89 %). Overall interobserver agreement was excellent and was analysed using an interclass correlation coefficient (0. 94; CI 0. 87 - 0. 97).

30|$|There is a {{correlation}} between hepatic parenchymal pathology and liver stiffness. As {{a surrogate marker of}} fibrosis and cirrhosis, the measurement of liver stiffness forms the basis of elastography. Stiffness, or the rigidity of an object, {{is the extent to which}} it resists deformation in response to a force applied. Elasticity is the tendency of solid materials to return to their original shape after being deformed by a force applied and removed. In elastography, such force is coupled with a system that measures the deformities caused by the force. Ultrasound elastography techniques include transient elastography (FibroScan®), acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI), <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> mode <b>elastography</b> and strain elastography. A recent review by Frulio and Trillaud provides details on different elastography techniques as well as a brief discussion on the main serum markers to assess for fibrosis [66]. A 2013 review by the Japan Society of Ultrasonics in Medicine discussed fundamental principles of elastography methods and physics of tissue elastic properties [67].|$|R
40|$|Non-invasive {{methods for}} liver {{stiffness}} assessment {{have been introduced}} over recent years. Of these, two main methods for estimating liver fibrosis using ultrasound elastography have become established in clinical practice: <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> and quasi-static or strain elastography. Shear waves are waves with a motion perpendicular (lateral) to {{the direction of the}} generating force. Shear waves travel relatively slowly (between 1 and 10 m/s). The stiffness of the liver tissue can be assessed based on shear wave velocity (the stiffness increases with the speed). The European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology has published Guidelines and Recommendations that describe these technologies and provide recommendations for their clinical use.

40|$|International audienceNon-invasive ultrafast imaging of {{intrinsic}} waves such as electromechanical waves or remotely induced <b>shear</b> <b>waves</b> in <b>elastography</b> imaging techniques for human cardiac applications remains a big challenge. In this {{paper we propose}} to perform ultrafast imaging of the heart with adapted sector size by coherently compounding diverging waves emitted from a standard transthoracic cardiac phased-array probe. As in ultrafast imaging with plane wave coherent compounding, diverging waves can be summed coherently to obtain high-quality images of the entire heart at high frame rate in a full field-of-view. To image the propagation of <b>shear</b> <b>waves</b> with a large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the field-of-view can be adapted by changing the angular aperture of the transmitted wave. Backscattered echoes from successive circular wave acquisitions are coherently summed at every location in the image to improve the image quality while maintaining very high frame rates. The transmitted diverging waves, angular apertures and subapertures sizes were tested in simulation and ultrafast coherent compounding was implemented in a commercial scanner. The improvement of the imaging quality was quantified in phantoms and in one human heart, in vivo. Imaging <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> propagation at 2500 frame/s using 5 diverging waves provided a large increase of the SNR of the tissue velocity estimates while maintaining a high frame rate. Finally, ultrafast imaging with 1 to 5 diverging waves was used to image the human heart at a frame rate of 4500 - 900 frames/s over an entire cardiac cycle.

40|$|Ultrasound <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> is {{becoming}} a valuable tool for measuring mechanical properties of individual muscles. Since ultrasound <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> measures shear modulus along the principal axis of the probe (i. e., along the transverse axis of the im-aging plane), the measured shear modulus most accurately represents the mechanical property of the muscle along the fascicle direction when the probe’s principal axis {{is parallel to the}} fascicle direction in the plane of the ultrasound image. However, it is unclear how the measured shear modulus is affected by the probe angle relative to the fascicle direction in the same plane. The {{purpose of the present study}} was therefore to examine whether the angle between the principal axis of the probe and the fascicle direction in the same plane af-fects the measured shear modulus. Shear modulus in seven specially-designed tissue-mimicking phantoms, and in eleven human in-vivo biceps brachii and medial gastrocnemius were determined by using ultrasound <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography.</b> The probe was positioned parallel or 20 ° obliquely to the fascicle across the B-mode images. The reproducibility of shear modulus measurements was high for both parallel and oblique conditions.

MethodsThis prospective study examined 57 consecutive patients with biochemically proven primary hyperparathyroidism and solitary parathyroid adenoma identified by ultrasound and confirmed {{by at least}} one of the following: surgical resection, positive Technetium– 99 m Sestamibi Scintigraphy (MIBI) scan, or fine needle aspiration biopsy with positive PTH washout (performed only in MIBI negative patients). Vascularity and <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> were performed for all patients. Parathyroid adenoma stiffness was measured as shear wave velocity in meters per second. ResultsThe median (range) pre-surgical value for PTH and calcium were 58 pg/mL (19, 427) and 10. 8 mg/dL (9. 5, 12. 1), respectively. 37 patients had positive MIBI scan. 20 patients had negative MIBI scan but diagnosis was confirmed with positive PTH washout. 42 patients underwent parathyroidectomy, and an adenoma was confirmed in all. The median (range) shear wave velocity for all parathyroid adenomas enrolled in this study was 2. 02 m/s (1. 53, 2. 50). The median (range) shear wave velocity for thyroid tissue was 2. 77 m/s (1. 89, 3. 70). The shear wave velocity of the adenomas was independent of adenoma size, serum parathyroid hormone concentration, or plasma parathyroid hormone concentration.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) is a remarkably flexible diagnostic platform {{due to the}} variety of clinically relevant physical, chemical, and biological phenomena it can detect. In addition to the host of endogenous contrast mechanisms available, MRI functionality can be further extended by incorporating exogenous factors to attain sensitivity to new classes of indicators. Molecular imaging with targeted injectable contrast agents and MR elastography with externally delivered acoustic vibrations are two such advancements with increasing clinical significance. Conventionally employed separately, this work explores how exogenous components can interact cooperatively in imaging disease and may be combined to more accurately stage disease progression and generate novel mechanisms of MR contrast, using contrast agents and acoustic stimulation as model systems. We imaged hepatic fibrosis in a rat model and found that collagen-binding paramagnetic contrast agents and <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> MR <b>elastography</b> had partially uncorrelated staging abilities, due to the disease condition's differential timing of collagen production and its stiff cross-linking. This complementary feature enabled us to form a composite multivariate model incorporating both methods which exhibited superior diagnostic staging over all stages of fibrosis progression. We then integrated acoustics and molecular-targeting agents at a deeper level {{in the form of}} a novel contrast mechanism, Acoustically Induced Rotary Saturation (AIRS), which switches "on" and "off" the image contrast due to the agents by adjusting the resonance of the spin-lock condition. This contrast modulation ability provides unprecedented clarity in identifying contrast agent presence as well as sensitive and quantitative statistical measurements via rapidly modulated block design experiments. Finally, we extend the AIRS method and show preliminary results for Saturation Harmonic Induced Rotary Saturation (SHIRS), which detects the second harmonic time-oscillation of iron oxide nanoparticles' magnetization in response to an oscillating applied field around B 0.

40|$|During {{prolonged}} low-level contractions, synergist {{muscles are}} activated in an alternating pattern of activity and silence called as alternate muscle activity.

Thus, we investigated whether {{the difference in the}} extent of fatigue of each plantar flexor synergist corresponded to the difference in the frequency of alternate muscle activity between the synergists using muscle shear modulus as an index of muscle stiffness. Nineteen young men voluntarily participated in this study. The shear moduli of the resting medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles (MG and LG) and soleus muscle (SOL) were measured using <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> ultrasound <b>elastography</b> before and after a 1 -h sustained contraction at 10 % peak torque during maximal voluntary contraction of isometric plantar flexion. One subject did not accomplish the task and the alternate muscle activity for MG was not found in 2 subjects; therefore, data for 16 subjects were used for further analyses. The magnitude of muscle activation during the fatiguing task was similar in MG and SOL. The percent change in shear modulus before and after the fatiguing task (MG: 16. 7 ± 12. 0 %, SOL: − 4. 1 ± 13. 9 %; mean ± standard deviation) and the alternate muscle activity during the fatiguing task (MG: 33 [20 – 51] times, SOL: 30 [17 – 36] times; median [25 th– 75 th percentile]) were significantly higher in MG than in SOL.

These results suggest that the degree of increase in muscle shear modulus induced by prolonged contraction corresponds to the frequency of alternate muscle activity between MG and SOL during prolonged contraction. Thus, it is likely that, compared with SOL, the alternate muscle activity of MG occurs more frequently during prolonged contraction due to the greater increase in fatigue of MG induced by the progression of a fatiguing task...|$|R

Two conditions, <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> frequency condition and <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> displacement amplitude condition, are required, however, these conditions are not severe restrictions in most applications. Using the proposed method, <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity of trapezius muscle is measured. The result is consistent with the velocity which is calculated from shear elastic modulus measured by ARFI method...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground: Ultrasound <b>Shear</b> <b>Wave</b> <b>Elastography</b> {{has been}} widely used in {{clinical}} practice to access tissues' stiffness non-invasively. However, the application of this technique to access myocardial stiffness clinically and non-invasively was yet not demonstrated. In this study, we introduce a new prototype for clinical application purposes, the Myocardial <b>Shear</b> <b>Wave</b> <b>Elastography</b> imaging (MSWEi) device. Methods: The MSWEi device lays on a linear phased-array probe (2. 75 -MHz, Vermon S. A., Tours, France) connected to an ultrafast ultrasound scanner (Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Aix-en-Provence, France), a dedicated sequence of <b>Shear</b> <b>Wave</b> <b>Elastography</b> and unfocused emissions at very high frame rate for myocardial stiffness evaluation, and a dedicated graphical user interface for physicians use in clinical settings. Results: This prototype was evaluated and validated in-vitro using calibrated mimicking tissue phantoms, providing accurate and robust measurements for tissues' stiffness up to 25 kPa. The device was also validated for stiffness estimation on different thin layers for thickness superior to 5 -mm, showing a bias estimation inferior to 15 %. Finally, the in-vivo and non-invasive application of the prototype was also evaluated on a patient. Conclusion: This study presented a new device to evaluate non-invasively myocardial stiffness using an ultrafast ultrasound scanner in a clinical setting. The in-vivo, non-invasive and clinical feasibility was demonstrated showing {{the potential of the}} device to evaluate myocardial stiffness accurately up to 25 KPa and for myocardial wall thickness superior to 5 -mm...|$|E
40|$|PublishedJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tDevelopment of <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> gave {{access to}} {{non-invasive}} muscle stiffness assessment in vivo. The {{aim of the}} present study was to define a measurement protocol to be used in clinical routine for quantifying the shear modulus of lower limb muscles. Four positions were defined to evaluate shear modulus in 10 healthy subjects: parallel to the fibers, in the anterior and posterior aspects of the lower limb, at rest and during passive stretching. Reliability was first evaluated on two muscles by three operators; these measurements were repeated six times. Then, measurement reliability was compared in 11 muscles by two operators; these measurements were repeated three times. Reproducibility of shear modulus was 0. 48 kPa and repeatability was 0. 41 kPa, with all muscles pooled. Position did not significantly influence reliability. <b>Shear</b> <b>wave</b> <b>elastography</b> appeared to be an appropriate and reliable tool to evaluate the shear modulus of lower limb muscles with the proposed protocol.
