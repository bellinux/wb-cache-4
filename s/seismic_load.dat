The effect of loading amplitudes on the relationships is presented.

From a building services perspective, the shear core houses communal services including stairs, lifts, toilets and service risers. Building serviceability requirements necessitates a proper arrangement of a shear core.

5000|$|Loose medium walls {{tend to be}} [...] "soil-on-a-shelf" [...] or [...] "soil-in-a-bag" [...] type systems. Loose medium {{systems have}} their soil packed into a shelf or bag and are then {{installed}} onto the wall. These systems require their media to be replaced {{at least once a}} year on exteriors and approximately every two years on interiors. Loose soil systems are not well suited for areas with any seismic activity. Most importantly, because these systems can easily have their medium blown away by wind-driven rain or heavy winds, these should not be used in applications over 8 feet high. There are some systems in Asia that have solved the loose media erosion problem by use of shielding systems to hold the media within the green wall system even when soil liquefaction occurs under <b>seismic</b> <b>load.</b> In these systems, the plants can still up-root themselves in the liquified soil under <b>seismic</b> <b>load,</b> and therefore it is required that the plants be secured to the system to prevent them from falling from the wall. Loose-soil systems without physical media erosion systems are best suited for the home gardener where occasional replanting is desired from season to season or year to year. Loose-soil systems with physical media erosion systems are well suited for all green wall applications.|$|E

Thus, the <b>seismic</b> <b>load</b> applied to the structure is efficiently reduced, which results in smaller cross sections for the beams and columns of the braced frames, smaller demands on the connections and, most importantly, the loads on the foundation are drastically decreased.|$|E

This paper presents seismic design of pile foundations for different ground conditions. Estimation of <b>seismic</b> <b>loads,</b> for a typical multi-storeyed building considered being located in different seismic zones, for different ground conditions according to Indian and European standard are presented. Design considerations based on various theories evolved on pile foundation performance concepts under seismic conditions are discussed.

40|$|A {{new design}} method named the Partial Capacity Design Method (PCDM) has been {{proposed}} by the Authors. In this method insteas of sise sway mechanism, partial side sway mechanism is employed, in which for a certain <b>seismic</b> <b>load</b> level (named target <b>seismic</b> <b>load)</b> some columns are allowed to develop plastic hinges while some selected columns are to remain elastic except at the base. To ensure these selected columns remain elastic, these columns are designed to resist magnified internal forces.

The performance of several symmetrical fully ductile concrete moment resisting frame designed {{in accordance with the}} latest Indonesian Seismic Code (SNI 03 1726 - 2002) using the proposed method has been presented elsewhere. In this paper the proposed method (PCDM) is used to design structures with vertical set-back. The seismic performances of the structures are evaluated using dynamic non-linear time history analysis. The results show that under the intended <b>seismic</b> <b>load</b> level (target <b>seismic</b> <b>load),</b> the selected columns remain elastic as expected.

40|$|On the {{assumption}} that allowable stress design method {{is going to be}} switched over to limit state design method for port and offshore structures in Japan, two of the authors have already studied the <b>load</b> factors of <b>seismic</b> <b>loads</b> based on reliability theory.

40|$|AbstractThe {{vibration}} {{characteristics and}} dynamic responses {{of rock and}} soil under <b>seismic</b> <b>load</b> can be estimated with dynamic finite element method (DFEM). Combining with the DFEM, the vector sum analysis method (VSAM) is employed in seismic stability analysis of a slope in this paper. Different from other conventional methods, the VSAM is proposed based on the vector characteristic of force and current stress state of the slope. The dynamic stress state of the slope at any moment under <b>seismic</b> <b>load</b> {{can be obtained by}} the DFEM, thus the factor of safety of the slope at any moment during earthquake can be easily obtained with the VSAM in consideration of the DFEM. Then, the global stability of the slope can be estimated on the basis of time-history curve of factor of safety and reliability theory. The VSAM is applied to a homogeneous slope under <b>seismic</b> <b>load.</b> The factor of safety of the slope is 1. 30 under gravity only and the dynamic factor of safety under <b>seismic</b> <b>load</b> is 1. 21. The calculating results show that the dynamic characteristics and stability state of the slope with input ground motion can be actually analyzed.

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{obstacles}} to be overcome for application of staggered wall systems is to ensure the seismic safety of the systems and to provide valid seismic design coefficients. In this study seismic performance and the behavior factors such as overstrength factors, ductility factors, and the response modification factors of reinforced concrete SWS structures were evaluated. The analysis {{results showed that the}} behavior factors obtained by pushover analysis and incremental dynamic analysis turned out to be similar to each other. The overstrength factors of the structures designed with medium-level <b>seismic</b> <b>load</b> turned out to be smaller than those of the structures designed with low-level <b>seismic</b> <b>load.</b> This is due mainly {{to the fact that the}} participation of gravity load is more significant in the design of the latter system. The structures with 9  m-long staggered walls showed higher overstrength than the structures with 6  m-long walls. The ductility factors were relatively uniform regardless of the height of the model structures and the length of the staggered walls with average value of 2.34. The response modification factors obtained by multiplying overstrength factor and ductility factor decreased as the number of stories increased. Except for the structure with 6  m-long staggered walls designed for medium-level <b>seismic</b> <b>load,</b> the response modification factors turned out to be higher than 3.0 which was used for evaluation of design <b>seismic</b> <b>load.</b> The magnitude of the response modification factors were contributed mainly from large overstrength rather than from large deformability. The response modification factors of the structures designed for low-level <b>seismic</b> <b>load</b> were higher than those of the structures designed for higher <b>seismic</b> <b>load.</b> Based on the analysis results, it is concluded that the RC SWS structures generally have adequate strength and ductility capacities to resist design <b>seismic</b> <b>load.</b> As the response modification factor of the model structures analyzed in this study ranged from 3.5 to 8, the current response modification factor of 3.0 seems to be in the conservative side and a little higher value of 3.5 or 4.0 may be more appropriate value for seismic design of staggered wall structures.|$|E
