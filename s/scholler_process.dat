5000|$|The {{first attempt}} at commercializing a process for ethanol from wood was done in Germany in 1898. It {{involved}} the use of dilute acid to hydrolyze the cellulose to glucose, {{and was able to}} produce 7.6 liters of ethanol per 100 kg of wood waste (18 gal per ton). The Germans soon developed an industrial process optimized for yields of around 50 gal per ton of biomass. This process soon found its way to the US, culminating in two commercial plants operating in the southeast during World War I. These plants used what was called [...] "the American Process" [...] â€” a one-stage dilute sulfuric acid hydrolysis. Though the yields were half that of the original German process (25 gal of ethanol per ton versus 50), the throughput of the American process was much higher. A drop in lumber production forced the plants to close shortly after the end of World War I. In the meantime, a small but steady amount of research on dilute acid hydrolysis continued at the USFS's Forest Products Laboratory. During World War II, the US again turned to cellulosic ethanol, this time for conversion to butadiene to produce synthetic rubber. The Vulcan Copper and Supply Company was contracted to construct and operate a plant to convert sawdust into ethanol. The plant was based on modifications to the original German <b>Scholler</b> <b>process</b> as developed by the Forest Products Laboratory. This plant achieved an ethanol yield of 50 gal per dry ton, but was still not profitable and was closed after the war.|$|E
