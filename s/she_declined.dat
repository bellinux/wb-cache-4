Fox wanted an A-list younger actress, and felt Rachel McAdams, then coming off successes in The Notebook and Mean Girls, {{would help the}} film's {{commercial}} prospects. However, <b>she</b> <b>declined</b> several offers to play Andy, telling the studio {{she was trying to}} avoid mainstream projects for a while.|$|E

Her final on-screen appearance {{was in the}} Frank Sinatra tribute Sinatra 75: The Best Is Yet to Come in 1990. <b>She</b> <b>declined</b> several offers of television work because {{she was forced to}} memorize scripts (as she was unable to read the cue cards without her glasses), and the bright studio lights caused her discomfort.|$|E
5|$|A year later, at {{the height}} of the 1975 Australian {{constitutional}} crisis, the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals. As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. <b>She</b> <b>declined,</b> stating that she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general. The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1951, {{relationships}} {{had deteriorated}} enough for Pollock, Newman, Still and Rothko to approach Betty Parsons {{with the idea}} of showing them exclusively, effectively leaving their erstwhile colleagues to fend for themselves. <b>She</b> <b>declined</b> the offer. Over the following three years Pollock, Still and Rothko moved to the Sidney Janis Gallery.

5|$|Ono {{is often}} {{associated}} with the Fluxus group, whose founder George Maciunas was her friend during the 1960s.

She did, however, collaborate with him, Charlotte Moorman, George Brecht, and the poet Jackson Mac Low, among others associated with the group.|$|E
5|$|She rekindled {{her studies}} {{too late in}} life to become a truly {{exceptional}} dancer, but she obsessively insisted on grueling daily practice (up to eight hours a day) that contributed to her subsequent physical and mental exhaustion. In September 1929, she was {{invited to join the}} ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples, but, as close as this was to the success she desired, <b>she</b> <b>declined</b> the invitation. While the public still believed the Fitzgeralds to live a life of glamor, friends noted that the couple's partying had somewhere gone from fashionable to self-destructive—both had become unpleasant company.|$|E

5|$|A coronial inquiry was {{conducted}} by the acting district officer in Talasea, which did not find a cause of death but concluded {{that there were no}} suspicious circumstances. It is believed that he died of complications from his war wounds. The men of the 10th Battalion AIF Club contacted his widow to ask that his remains be reinterred in the AIF Cemetery, Adelaide, South Australia, and offered their assistance, but <b>she</b> <b>declined,</b> choosing to have him remain buried on Garua Island in New Guinea.

5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting {{towards the end}} of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was {{prepared}} {{to go to war with}} Pakistan. In response, Manekshaw told her most of his armoured and infantry divisions were deployed elsewhere, only 12 of his tanks were combat-ready, and they would be competing for rail carriages with the grain harvest at that point of time. He also pointed out the Himalayan passes would soon open up, with the forthcoming monsoon in East Pakistan, which would result in heavy flooding. When Gandhi asked the cabinet to leave the room and Manekshaw to stay, he offered to resign. <b>She</b> <b>declined</b> to accept it, but sought his advice. He then said he could guarantee victory if she would allow him to prepare for the conflict on his terms, and set a date for it, and Gandhi agreed.|$|E
