5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire <b>safety</b> <b>controls</b> there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E

25|$|No single {{agency is}} {{responsible}} for all food safety regulations and enforcement in China, and the departments' duties often overlap. There are also local and regional food safety agencies, {{but there is no}} clear hierarchy of agencies at the local or national levels. In response to complexity of numerous agencies monitoring and regulating food safety, the National People's Congress established the State Food and Drug Administration in 2003. The State Food and Drug Administration was supposed to oversee the all aspects of food safety regulations and unify food <b>safety</b> <b>controls.</b> However, the State Food and Drug Administration has not become the main governing department as the government had intended, and the other national agencies have continued to regulate and monitor food safety. This unclear division of duties has created conflict and confusion when citizens have sought to complain or when a major crisis needed to be resolved.|$|E

40|$|Consumer {{demand for}} {{reliable}} food product quality and safety is growing. This trend, together with increased public regulation {{and attention to}} the legal liability of food processors and retailers creates derived demand for food safety assurance in farm production. In consequence, farms have adopted different measures, voluntarily or compulsorily, in their production practice to ensure reduced food safety risks from the farm product. Multiple individual indicators exist which reflect different facets of food safety practice. In fact, {{it is likely that}} production of a safer product is a result of several factors. However, little is known about what practices effect greater food <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> at the farm level, or how farms that take greater food <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> fare in comparison to other farms. This study develops a composite food <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> indicator by aggregating data from a set of individual indicators of food <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> and investigates the variation in food safety practices across farms.

40|$|Recently, highway <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> under extreme {{natural hazards}} in Taiwan has faced {{critical}} challenges because of latest extreme climates. In {{an effort to}} develop an efficient early warning system for highway safety, the authors have developed an early warning method based on disastrous rainfall indices and rainfall patterns. Fundamental concept of such a methodology is to reform risk prediction and risk management from passive mode to active mode to acquire more time for mitigation mobilization and safety evacuation. The threshold rainfall indices are used to characterize triggering mechanisms of rainfall-induced natural hazards and further applied as the early warning criteria for highway <b>safety</b> <b>control.</b> In this paper, development of such early warning system for highway <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> is introduced in detail.

40|$|Food borne illness today still {{results in}} high {{societal}} costs, even though FBOs have implemented food <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> systems. In addition, the susceptibility to food borne {{diseases of the}} human population {{is likely to increase}} in the coming decades. Thus food <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> needs to be improved. Since 2005, a new EU food safety policy aims to improve food safety through shifting primary responsibility for food safety from government to FBOs and through shifting food <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> from company level to supply chain level. This research aims to contribute to improvement of food safety by analyzing private incentive mechanisms aimed at food <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> on supply chain level. It focuses on the two stage supply chain between pig producers and slaughter company in the Netherlands. A framework for designing and developing incentive mechanisms for food <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> is developed. An incentive mechanism aimed at food <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> is defined as the set of the performance and compliance measurement system and the compensation scheme between buyer and supplier, which aims to induce the supplier to apply measures to <b>control</b> food <b>safety</b> hazards as the buyer requests. The framework includes all important characteristics of incentive mechanisms for food safety and their relationships. In this thesis the influence on supplier behaviour of four important characteristics of incentive mechanisms for food <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> are analysed, namely 1) the type of performance compensation, 2) the causes for variability in performance between suppliers, 3) the accuracy of a test to determine supplier performance, and 4) the reliability of information provided by the supplier. It uses different food safety hazards in pork: lesioned livers, Mycobacterium avium, and residues of antibiotics. Results show that a penalty for each lesioned liver was more effective to induce pig producers to use control measures than a collective premium. Variability in liver lesion prevalence between pig producers with a penalty for each lesioned liver occurred because each pig producer used different control measures with different effectiveness. The accuracy of a Mycobacterium avium test showed to {{have a significant impact on}} pig producer behaviour to use control measures if an incentive mechanism was in place. Finally, information about the use of antibiotics provided by pig producers without an incentive system for the reliability of the information was insufficiently reliable to guarantee absence of residues in pork. It is concluded in this thesis that private incentive mechanisms can be used to reduce opportunistic behaviour of pig producers, thereby improving food <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> on supply chain level and helping to raise food <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> to the next level. For optimal inducement it is important that the performance and compliance measurement system is attuned to the compensation scheme...|$|R
