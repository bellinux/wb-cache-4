25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of the optimistic bias is that people know more about themselves than they do about others. While individuals know how to think about themselves as a single person, they <b>still</b> <b>think</b> of others as a generalized group, which leads to biased estimates and inabilities to sufficiently understand their target or comparison group. Likewise, when making judgments and comparisons about their risk compared to others, people generally ignore the average person, but primarily focus on their own feelings and experiences.|$|E

25|$|We {{would often}} cross the broad avenue with the martial {{sounding}} name... The one that separated Courbevoie from Puteaux. It {{was in the}} peaceful garden of that welcoming household {{only a few years}} before the terrible year of 1914 that forms were born that, 50 years later, one would <b>still</b> <b>think</b> were new!

25|$|The two, at {{the extreme}} of their rivalry, {{climbing}} the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman , used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to me, {{it was clear that}} Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly then he would have cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E
25|$|Root threatens Mulch with {{imprisonment}} in {{the goblin}} prison Howler's Peak, and offers the dwarf a two-day head start if he assists in the break-in. The team use Mulch's original strategy to enter {{through one of}} the titanium foundation rods. One rod was not actually solid as Mulch and his cousin had diverted sewage into the shaft instead. After reaching the bottom of the foundation rod, and climbing through Mulch's recyclings, Butler, Root and Holly mount a desperate charge to the communications centre. While the three soldiers battle through an army of goblins, Artemis enters the network of deactivated plasma cannons to reach the centre by another route. Artemis manages to sneak into the hub long enough to communicate with Foaly, who uses Artemis's laptop to play back Cudgeon's own voice, revealing that Cudgeon planned to betray the goblins. Cudgeon is unfazed, and reactivates the plasma cannons to knock out all the goblins in Koboi Labs. Butler, Root and Holly smash their way into the centre, where Cudgeon holds Artemis at gunpoint. However, Foaly calls Artemis' mobile phone, and Artemis hands it to Koboi, who is then enraged to find that Cudgeon planned to betray her too. The two masterminds grapple with each other on Opal's hoverchair, and Cudgeon is killed when he is thrown into the open DNA cannon plasma feed, while the crash causes Opal to blackout, and destroys the remote control used by Opal to control LEP weaponry. Foaly uses the restored power to activate DNA cannons in Police Plaza, neutralizing most of the goblins involved in the revolt. Foaly remains in the Operations Booth, as the LEP outside, commanded by Captain Trouble Kelp, <b>still</b> <b>think</b> he is to blame for the revolt.|$|E

500|$|During {{the initial}} run of Dexter's Lab, a segment titled [...] "Rude Removal" [...] (season two, 1997) was produced. The short {{involves}} Dexter creating a [...] "rude removal system" [...] to diminish Dee Dee and Dexter's rudeness; however, it instead creates highly rude clones of both siblings. The episode was only shown during certain animation festivals {{and was never}} aired on Cartoon Network or any television channel due to the characters swearing, even though the swear words were censored. Tartakovsky commented that [...] "standards didn't like it." [...] Linda Simensky, then-vice president of original programming for Cartoon Network, said [...] "I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it's very funny. It probably would air better late at night." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1931, Yost told Grantland Rice that {{he still}} {{considered}} the 1925 team {{to be better than}} his [...] "Point-a-Minute" [...] from the early 1900s: [...] "I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> the best team I ever coached was the 1925 bunch. [...] They had everything. [...] Those early teams had speed and power. [...] But the game was simpler then. [...] That 1925 bunch, which included Friedman and Oosterbaan, could run an end, buck a line, throw passes, kick, block, tackle, think, and do about everything needed on a football field to gain ground and keep other people from gaining ground. [...] Don't forget about that 1925 team that our opponents had a hard time making first downs, much less winning the game." ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who {{has often}} been heavily {{influenced}} by the various Quatermass serials, and despite Kneale's dislike of it ("It sounded a terrible idea and I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it was," [...] he commented in 1986) and his refusal to write for it, unofficial references to Quatermass {{have appeared in the}} programme and its spinoffs. [...] Serials directly influenced include The Web of Fear, The Invasion, Spearhead from Space, The Ambassadors of Death, Inferno, The Seeds of Doom and Image of the Fendahl, as well as the 2007 [...] "The Lazarus Experiment", which echoes the first serial's climax in Westminster Abbey, with the use of Southwark Cathedral. Former Doctor Who script editor and producer Derrick Sherwin admitted on a DVD documentary that the idea of setting more serials on contemporary Earth in the early 1970s was to recall a Quatermass feel.|$|E

500|$|Lee {{conceptualized}} {{the video}} around {{the lyrics to}} the song: [...] "It's kind of about exposing that it's fake. And the video's more {{along the lines of}} exposing the real behind-the-scenes [...] of some of these people. It's basically showing the glamorous lifestyle and the depressed, selfish misery behind it. [...] It's like beating a dead horse at this point, but at the time Britney Spears was just coming out. But I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it's relevant." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "fans will get to see Amy Lee like never before. Instead of her homemade wings and signature gothic garb, the clip finds Lee dressed alternately as a wholesome teenager, a kitschy pop idol and a softly lit glamazon." [...] Amy Lee portrays the life of a model who promotes products by a company called [...] "Lies". The music video focuses on the struggles that Lee's character suffers with because of her modeling career and her opposite lifestyle.|$|E
500|$|Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, praised the episode, calling it [...] "a great episode because the {{accidents}} that befall the pro players are so funny." [...] Chris Turner, {{the author of the book}} Planet Simpson, said that the episode was the indication that [...] "the Golden Age [...] had arrived." [...] Nate Meyers gave the episode four and a half out of five, stating [...] "the script makes great use of the baseball superstars, giving each of them a strong personality and plenty of pep (the highlight has to be Mattingly's clash with Mr. Burns)." [...] Colin Jacobson disliked the episode: [...] "when [...] originally aired, I didn't like it. While I've warmed up to the show slightly over the last decade, I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it's generally weak, and I'd definitely pick it as Season Three's worst." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, the band had to remove two of the {{original}} tracks over allegations of copyright infringement. The two tracks, [...] "'Purity" [...] and [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", were inspired by a story that was published online about a girl named Purity Knight, who was kidnapped and buried alive. The website, called Crime Scene, presents fictional stories as real life crime cases. Originally, the website didn't include any disclaimer saying that it was a work of fiction. Many viewers believed that the story was true, including Slipknot frontman, Corey Taylor."I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> the story's real. It fucked our whole world up when we read it. Can you imagine a girl being buried in a box and have all this lecherous bullshit drip down on her from this guy? It just hurts your head." [...] The case was further {{complicated by the fact that}} audio samples from the authoring website were included in [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", which serves as a prelude to [...] "Purity".|$|E

500|$|Kneale {{never saw}} himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often {{critical}} of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series Doctor Who (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), {{for which he had}} once turned down an offer to write. [...] "It sounded a terrible idea and I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it was," [...] he commented in 1986. [...] "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has Crossroads and that's a stinker". He also slammed Blake's 7, which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: [...] "I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen of a thing called Blake's 7 which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" [...] and Doomwatch: [...] "I was approached to write Doomwatch. That didn't seem to be much good either." [...] Doctor Who was heavily influenced by Kneale's Quatermass serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from Quatermass.|$|E
500|$|Various plotlines leaked {{before the}} episode's release, {{the most notable}} being {{the death of the}} Lone Gunmen. The choice to kill off the trio was controversial; Gilligan himself later {{admitted}} that [...] "I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> we made the wrong choice on that one." [...] Spotnitz later said, [...] "I can't say I regret killing them off, as you know, no one really dies in The X-Files [...] But I do feel tonally {{it was a mistake to}} end the episode on such a somber note. I wish we'd ended it on a laugh or smile." [...] The actors who played The Lone Gunmen complimented the script. Harwood admitted that the episode would have either featured the trio's death or would have featured them [...] "walk off into the sunset without hobo bags over our shoulders." [...] Ultimately, he concluded that [...] "I was glad we were killed off in the end". Dean Haglund said that he [...] "liked the way we were sent off", and called the ending [...] "cool".|$|E
500|$|Talking further about Scritti Politti, a British post-punk band, Minogue reminisced {{about her}} {{collaboration}} with the band's frontman Green Gartside, who provides vocals on the track [...] "Someday", saying, [...] "To this day I haven't met him! I {{left a message on}} his answering machine, saying, [...] "Hi, it's Kylie! I just wanted to say thanks so much! You sound brilliant!" [...] "After Dark" [...] was co-written by Dennis, who had previously co-written [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] for Minogue. Torrini, who co-wrote [...] "Slow", revealed how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened".
