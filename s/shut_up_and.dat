In 2002, British singer Kelly Osbourne recorded a hard rock cover of the song with Incubus members Mike Einziger (on guitar) and José Pasillas (on drums); the cover was produced by her brother Jack Osbourne. Osbourne's cover was included as a bonus track on her debut album <b>Shut</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> on the soundtrack of MTV's reality television program The Osbournes.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor {{was originally devised}} by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, with his depiction as a rough-living and dangerous man developed through various pieces of concept art by Metzen. In an interview, Raynor's voice actor Robert Clotworthy cited one piece of this concept art in how he decided to voice the character. The art, showing Raynor on a hoverbike and outfitted with futuristic weaponry, gave Clotworthy the impression that as Raynor was someone people [...] "wouldn't mess with", {{he would not have}} to raise his voice as [...] "other characters [...] <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> listen" [...] or face the consequences. Clotworthy also stated that in the event that a StarCraft film was produced, he believed Clive Owen would be the perfect choice to play Raynor due to him [...] "being dangerous".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, {{the film}} was mocked on the Internet comedy series Nostalgia Critic, which {{highlighted}} the film's bad acting and writing, but encouraged viewers to see the movie: [...] "It truly {{is one of those}} films you have to see to believe." [...] The episode was taken down following claims of copyright infringement from Wiseau-Films. It was replaced by a short video titled [...] "The Tommy Wi-Show", in which host Doug Walker, dressed as Wiseau, mocked the threatened legal actions. The main review was later reinstated. Both Greg Sestero and Juliette Danielle have praised the review, and Sestero later made a cameo appearance on The Nostalgia Critic episode [...] "Dawn of the Commercials", reprising his role of Mark.

When Lisa takes a sip, she hallucinates, grows violent and paranoid, and wanders away from the ride, tripping out to the parade music. While Selma is looking for Lisa, Bart gets on a roller coaster called The Barrel Roll and ends up having to be rescued after the car stops {{in the center of}} one of the inversions. Lisa is soon found swimming nude in the Fermentarium, returned to Selma and given pills by an unlicensed doctor.|$|E
500|$|... "This Is England", {{much like}} the rest of the album that came out later that year, had been {{drastically}} re-engineered by Rhodes, with synths and football-style chants added to Strummer's incomplete recordings. Although Howard was an adept drummer, drum machines were used for virtually all of the percussion tracks. For the remainder of his life, Strummer largely disowned the album, although he did profess that [...] "I really like 'This Is England' [...] 'North and South' is a vibe." [...] In early 1986, the Clash disbanded. Strummer later described the group's end: [...] "When the Clash collapsed, we were tired. There had been a lot of intense activity in five years. Secondly, I felt we'd run out of idea gasoline. And thirdly, I wanted to <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> let someone else have a go at it." ...|$|E

500|$|She also {{performed}} {{it at the}} 2009 Super Bowl, which {{was held at the}} Pepsi Center in Denver, Colorado. According to Gil Kaufman from MTV, the performance featured [...] "a chair dance, lots of funky wah-wah and screaming guitar solos, and graphics of spinning rims and neon speed gauges on the mega screens". Rihanna performed [...] "Shut Up and Drive" [...] on her three major tours: Good Girl Gone Bad (2007–09), Last Girl on Earth (2010–11) and the Loud Tour (2011). The performances of the song on the Last Girl on Earth and the Loud Tour shows, featured a car present on the stage. In a review of one of the shows from the Loud Tour, Jonathan McCambridge from Belfast Telegraph commented about the performance, [...] "'During <b>Shut</b> <b>Up</b> <b>And</b> Drive', a car appeared from underneath the stage and a number of dancers then proceeded to pretend to batter the hell out of it for no obvious reason." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the critics}} were divided on Rihanna's {{decision}} to collaborate with Brown again. Toronto Stars Lucas Oleniuk stated that [...] "Nobody's Business" [...] {{is not a bad}} track, [...] "it’s one of the catchiest and freshest-sounding here — but the troubling subtext is as irksome as the irony of titling a song that proudly makes the pair’s business everybody's." [...] Bernard Perusse of Montreal Gazette noted that although it is a pretty fair R smoker, there is something nauseating and sinister about the song and that is its message. Being more critical towards the collaboration, Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times wrote that the track represents a sad inversion of the 1965 single [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] by Sonny & Cher, further noting [...] " [...] Instead of singing about connection, true love and wanting to shout it to the world, the song features a convicted abuser and the woman he assaulted asking everyone to <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> leave them alone." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the appeal, the Ninth Circuit {{overturned}} the district court's verdict and ruled that Accolade's decompilation of the Sega software constituted fair use. [...] The court's written opinion followed on October 20, 1992, and noted that the use of the software was non-exploitative, although commercial. Further, the court found that the trademark infringement, being required by the TMSS for a Genesis game to run on the system, had been inadvertently triggered by a fair use act and was the fault of Sega for having caused false labeling. [...] Ultimately, Sega and Accolade settled the case on April 30, 1993. As a part of this settlement, Accolade became an official licensee of Sega, and later developed and released Barkley <b>Shut</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> Jam! while under license. [...] The terms of the licensing, including whether or not any special arrangements or discounts were made to Accolade, were not released to the public. The financial terms of the settlement were also not disclosed, although both companies agreed to pay their own legal costs.|$|E

500|$|Nash is {{also known}} for his outspoken {{political}} views. [...] He was an early, public opponent of the 2003 Iraq War, wearing a custom-made T-shirt to the 2003 NBA All Star Game that stated [...] "No war – Shoot for peace". Although Nash did get positive support from teammate Nick Van Exel among others, he also drew criticism from David Robinson, a former Naval officer and fellow NBA player as well as commentators like Skip Bayless who criticized Nash as being uninformed and advised him to [...] "just <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> play". Nash has also been critical of Arizona's SB1070, legislation which seeks to aggressively address illegal immigration, as he felt [...] "the law obviously can target opportunities for racial profiling." [...] In August 2017, Nash was critical of President Donald Trump {{in the aftermath of}} the 2017 Unite the Right rally, stating that [...] "to defend white supremacists and then slang his shitty ass grape juice pretty much sums the man up", referring to a winery Donald Trump has in Charlottesville, Virginia.|$|E
500|$|On January 8, 1993, with Sega's {{petition}} for a rehearing still pending, the court took {{the unusual step of}} amending its October 20, 1992 opinion {{and lifted the}} injunction preventing Accolade from developing or selling Genesis software. [...] This was followed by a formal denial of Sega's {{petition for}} a rehearing on January 26. As Accolade's counterclaim for false labeling under the Lanham Act was declined by the Ninth Circuit, this essentially left [...] "each party as free to act as it was before the issuance of preliminary injunctive relief" [...] while the district court considered the counterclaim. Sega and Accolade ultimately settled on April 30, 1993. [...] As a part of this settlement, Accolade became an official licensee of Sega, and later developed and released Barkley <b>Shut</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> Jam! while under license.

500|$|The {{first floor}} {{contains}} {{one of the}} grandest rooms in the house, the Library. The room was {{formerly known as the}} Great Chamber; in a 16th-century mansion, such as Montacute, this room was the epicentre of all ceremony and state: hence, its position {{at the head of the}} principal staircase, making it the finale of a processional route. Here, the most important guests would have been received, and where the Phelips dined formally with their guests and where musical entertainments and dancing would take place. The Great Chamber at Montacute contains the finest chimney-piece in the house; however, its classical statuary depicting nudes are long gone, victims of Victorian prudery. During the 18th century the room was <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> used a store and permitted to decay; this explains why in the 19th century it was completely restored in [...] "Elizabethan style." [...] The strapwork ceiling, panelling and bookcases all date from this period. The only original features remaining are the heraldic stained glass in the windows and the Portland stone chimney-piece. The room contains an ornate carved wooden porch; installed in the library in the 1830s, it was originally in the parlour below.|$|E
