25|$|The {{development}} team {{used the}} basic work done for Sakura Wars while expanding and improving existing battle and dialogue functions, {{in addition to}} taking player feedback into consideration while making alterations. The amount of added content resulted {{in the number of}} discs increasing from two to three. The storyline was designed to be darker than that of Sakura Wars, featuring darker themes and political elements. Kyogoku's attempted coup was based upon the February 26 Incident. The game's subtitle was taken from the title of a famous anti-war poem written by Japanese author and poet Akiko Yosano, tying into the game's themes and story. The anime cutscenes were created by <b>studio</b> <b>Production</b> I.G. Sakura Wars 2 was their first work on the Sakura Wars series.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} ways to create techno, but the {{majority}} will depend upon the use of loop-based step sequencing as a compositional method. Techno musicians, or producers, rather than employing traditional compositional techniques, may work in an improvisatory fashion, often treating the electronic music studio as one large instrument. The collection of devices found in a typical studio will include units that are capable of producing many different sounds and effects. <b>Studio</b> <b>production</b> equipment is generally synchronized using a hardware- or computer-based MIDI sequencer, enabling the producer to combine in one arrangement the sequenced output of many devices. A typical approach to using this type of technology compositionally is to overdub successive layers of material while continuously looping a single measure or sequence of measures. This process will usually continue until a suitable multi-track arrangement has been produced.|$|E

25|$|A {{remake of}} Sakura Wars for the PlayStation 2, titled Sakura Wars: In Hot Blood, was {{announced}} in 2002 {{as part of the}} Sakura Wars World Project. Developed by Sega studio Overworks, the remake was directed by Teruyu Terada, who had been battle planner for later Sakura Wars titles. The remake originated as part of Sega's efforts to reintroduce the wider world to the Sakura Wars series. As the versions of Sakura Wars prior to this point seemed old and awkward when compared to its sequels up to that point, it was decided to remake Sakura Wars. New CGI segments were created, and the anime sequences redone by <b>studio</b> <b>Production</b> I.G. The subtitle was taken from a Tanka featured in Midaregami, a collection of tanka by famous Japanese writer and poet Akiko Yosano. Hiroi enjoyed her work, so featured quotes from her poems as subtitles for Sakura Wars titles several times following the first game's release.|$|E
25|$|Unlike these earlier shows, Moonlighting {{sometimes}} {{broke the}} fourth wall {{in much more}} involved and complex ways. Cold opens sometimes featured Shepherd and Willis (in character as Maddie Hayes and David Addison), other actors, viewers, or TV critics directly addressing the audience about the show's production itself. These cold opens were originally born out of desperation {{as a way to}} fill air time, since the dialogue on the show was spoken so quickly and the producers needed something to fill the entire hour. In some other episodes, the plot suddenly changed into extended sequences that involved crew dismantling or changing the sets, characters wandering off the set into other parts of the <b>studio,</b> <b>production</b> crew stepping into the scene as a deus ex machina (e.g. a propmaster suddenly walking into the scene and taking the villain's gun away), or guest actors dropping character and referring to each other by their real names. However, other than in stand-alone openings, the main actors never stepped out of character during the episodes.|$|E
