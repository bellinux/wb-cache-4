5|$|In Great Britain, Lord Hillsborough, who had {{recently}} been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, was alarmed {{by the actions of}} the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also ordered Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to direct the Massachusetts House to rescind the letter. The house refused to comply.|$|E

These included the Europe Minister Caroline Flint, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, the Minister for Children Beverley Hughes, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Hazel Blears, and Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell, who resigned minutes after the polls for the local and European elections had closed and <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister calling on him to step aside.|$|E

5|$|At {{the close}} of the 19th century the Catholic church in the Indies began {{targeting}} the majority-Muslim indigenous population. They were not alone; Protestant missionaries such as Sierk Coolsma of the Netherlands Missionary Union and Mattheus Teffer of the Netherlands Missionary Society had had some success with the Sundanese in Cianjur and Javanese in Ambarawa, respectively. Keijzer, before stepping down as head pastor in 1894, <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands asking that men be sent to learn the Javanese language, in order to enable them to preach to the people and translate the catechism and some prayer books.|$|E
5|$|Hermano Pule {{immediately}} sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop José Seguí in Manila rebuking the acts of the Tayabas friars, and accusing them of beatings and threatening the excommunication of cofradía members. He also challenged the friars' authority to do such acts because the aims of the cofradía were never against the Catholic faith. On January 29, 1841, Pule <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bishop of Nueva Cáceres restating that the cofradía was not against canon law. The letter was forwarded to the juez provisor of the bishopric, who then endorsed it to Fr. Antonio Mateo and Fr. Manuel Sancho, who rejected Pule's petition.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2008, it was {{reported}} that Favre was in contact with the Packers about a possible return to the team. On July 11, 2008, Favre <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Packers asking for his unconditional release to allow him to play for another NFL team. Packers general manager Ted Thompson announced he would not grant Favre an unconditional release and reaffirmed the organization's commitment to Aaron Rodgers as its new quarterback. Complicating matters was Favre's unique contract giving him the leverage to void any potential trade by not reporting to the camp of the team he might be traded to if the Packers elect to go that route.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{intended}} to {{only be a}} one-year project, Cirque du Soleil was scheduled to perform in 11 towns in Quebec {{over the course of}} 13 weeks running concurrent with the third La Fête Foraine. The first shows were riddled with difficulty, starting {{with the collapse of the}} big top after the increased weight of rainwater caused the central mast to snap. Working with a borrowed tent, Laliberté then had to contend with difficulties with the European performers. They were so unhappy with the Quebec circus's inexperience that they had, at one point, <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media complaining about how they were being treated.|$|E
5|$|The Ashaninkas were {{pressured}} to begin growing coca as cocaine trafficking increased in Peru {{by the early}} 1980s.

As the trade grew in the area, though, Gagnon talked to a United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent and <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Peruvian security police base commander in Mazamari in 1983. Gagnon was told, and heeded the advice of two drug traffickers, not make any further overtures about the cocaine trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Kentucky's citizens believed {{the state should}} be a mediator between the North and South. On December 9, 1860, Kentucky Governor Beriah Magoffin <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other slave state governors, suggesting that they {{come to an agreement}} with the North that would include strict enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, a division of common territories at the 37th parallel, a guarantee of free use of the Mississippi River, and a Southern veto over slave legislation. Magoffin proposed a conference of slave states, followed by a conference of all the states to secure the concessions. Because of the escalating pace of events, neither conference was held.|$|E

5|$|After the French {{conquest of}} Algeria, Abdelkader El Djezairi {{declared}} war against France, and requested assistance from Sultan Abd al-Rahman of Morocco. When the Sultan responded favorably, it triggered the Franco-Moroccan War. France sent warships to bombard Tangier on 6 August 1844, destroying {{large parts of}} the city and its defenses. The French then bombarded Essaouira, and occupied the Iles Purpuraires. After the French army defeated the Moroccan cavalry at the Battle of Isly on 14 August 1844, Sultan Abd al-Rahman asked for peace with France, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Tangier on 10 September 1844. Morocco's defeat caused a revolt in Rabat; in Salé, the city's nobility, known as the Sharif, <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sultan complaining about the lack of weapons and ammunition in the city.|$|E
5|$|Chilembwe {{also sought}} {{support for his}} {{uprising}} from the German forces in German East Africa, on Nyasaland's far northern border, hoping that a German offensive from the north combined with a native insurrection in the south might force the British out of Nyasaland permanently. On 24 January, he <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> German Governor by courier through Portuguese East Africa. The courier was intercepted and the letter was never received. During the latter stages of the East African Campaign, after the German invasion of Portuguese East Africa, the German colonial army actually helped to suppress anti-Portuguese rebellions, among the Makombe and Barue peoples, worrying that African uprisings would destabilise the colonial order.|$|E
5|$|Continuing a {{theme of}} his presidency, in 2006 Mosley called for Formula One {{manufacturers}} to develop technology relevant to road cars. In recent years, {{a large proportion of}} the enormous budget of Formula One has been spent on the development of very powerful, very high-revving engines, which some say have little applicability to road cars. Mosley has announced a 10-year freeze on the development of engines, which would allow manufacturers to spend more of their budgets on environmentally friendly technology such as the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) introduced in 2009. In July 2008, he <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Formula One teams, in which he called for the teams to propose future sporting regulations to address specific issues including reduced fuel consumption.|$|E

5|$|In June 1841, {{with the}} help of {{influential}} supporters (among them was Domingo Róxas), Pule again <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Real Audiencia requesting for the cofradía to be recognized. This letter was forwarded to the office of Governor-General Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri. The Governor-General himself personally reviewed the petition and was disturbed by the cofradías rule which excluded Spaniards and mestizos from joining without Pule's permission. This made De Oraá believe that it was a seditious organization where religion was used as a blind for potential insurgence against Spanish authorities. De Oraá then recommended Pule's dismissal from San Juan de Dios Hospital and had the cofradía outlawed in July 1841, ordering its disbandment and the arrests of its members. Pule immediately went into hiding to avoid capture.|$|E
5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and did not respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E
5|$|Jorge Godoy Rojas, {{architect}} of the University of Chile, suggested in an January 2007 article he wrote for the online newspaper El Cachapoal that a semi-autonomous legal entity be {{set up for the}} management of the cultural center. Such a legal entity had also been suggested to the authorities previously by local cultural organizations for several years, but they had been largely ignored. On 20 November 2008, fourteen local organizations, including the Tourism Chamber of Pichilemu, the Agrupación Ciudadana por un Pichilemu Limpio (Citizens Group for a Clean Pichilemu), and Canal 3 Pichilemu, <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pichilemu City Council requesting the creation of the Corporación Cultural de Pichilemu (Pichilemu Cultural Corporation) for the third time.|$|E

5|$|On February 22, 1972, the {{governors}} of the Passamaquoddy tribes at Indian Township and Pleasant Point {{wrote a letter to}} Louis R.

In early March, Bruce <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Department of the Interior recommending that the tribes' request be granted. No reply was forthcoming before April 1. Tureen met with William Gershuny, the Associate Solicitor for Indian Affairs, who said more time was needed. On mid-May, Tureen persuaded Governor Kenneth Curtis to issue a public statement saying that the Passamaquoddy deserved their date in court. Senators Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME) and Edmund S. Muskie (D-ME) and Representatives William Hathaway (D-ME) and Peter Kyros (D-ME) also issued similar statements of support.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 1824 Mr. Lowndes, the BFBS's {{secretary}} in Corfu, <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{society in which}} he mentioned that the sum paid to Meksi for his work was 6,000 piastras and that Archimandrite Grigor was paid 60 crowns. On September 5, 1824 the Saint Matthew's Gospel was published in Albanian. According to Lowndes' letters, the Albanian community of Missolonghi was extremely excited when mass was said with a piece from Saint Matthew, as since its translation they had been impatient to hear it in Albanian. In July 1827 the form in which the first 500copies of the New Testament were to be bound was decided in London. The entire edition amounted to 2,000copies.|$|E
5|$|Phocas's rule lacked {{legitimacy}} and quickly {{came to be}} resented by the populace and the elites of the Byzantine Empire. What prestige he had further eroded when the Persian shah Khosrau II (r. 590–628) declared war, and when the Byzantine forces began to suffer their first defeats. According to a later tradition, Priscus <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Exarch of Africa, Heraclius the Elder, urging him to revolt. This is probably a later invention, but if true, it would indicate the level of dissent even within Constantinople. Whatever {{the truth of the}} matter, in 608 Africa rose in revolt, and the Exarch's son, Heraclius the Younger, was dispatched against Constantinople {{at the head of a}} fleet. Unopposed by Phocas's forces, he landed at the suburb of Hebdomon on October 3 and marched to the capital, where pro-Heraclian riots had broken out. At this juncture, Priscus pretended to be ill, and withdrew to his mansion at the Boraïdou quarter, where he assembled the excubitores and his own retainers (bucellarii), thus depriving Phocas of his main source of armed support. He is also recorded by John of Nikiu to have safeguarded the women of Heraclius's family from retribution by Phocas.|$|E
