40|$|Objective: Impaired facial expression, {{including}} {{spontaneous and}} emotional movements such as smiling, has been often reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). There {{is a general}} consensus that spontaneous smiling is abnormal in PD. Investigations on posed smiling yield contrasting results. Moreover, no study has yet addressed the relationship between posed smiling and abnormalities of voluntary movements of the lower face, global motor impairment {{and the effects of}} dopaminergic medication. Methods: We investigated the kinematics of posed smiling (mimicking a smile shown in a picture) and those of voluntary movements of the lower face (<b>showing</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> as fast as possible - voluntary grinning) in 15 patients with PD (ON and OFF therapy) and in 16 healthy controls. Facial movements were recorded using a 3 D optoelectronic system and analyzed using dedicated software. Results: Some kinematic parameters of both posed smiling and voluntary grinning were abnormally lower in PD patients in comparison to healthy subjects. The kinematics of posed smiling correlated with those of voluntary grinning in PD patients but not in healthy controls. Posed smiling and voluntary grinning abnormalities were related to global motor severity but did not significantly improve upon L-dopa administration. Conclusions: These results suggest that posed smiling and voluntary grinning are both abnormal in PD patients and that they are likely mediated by a common pathophysiological mechanism. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Computers {{are used}} {{more and more}} in medical applications. Well{known {{examples}} are the analysis of radiographs or MR images [12, 9]. A special eld is the analysis of human faces and facial features. Already realized applications exist e. g. for face recognition [1, 2] or face analysis [13, 6]. With the presented system we consider the problem of diagnosis support of patients with facial paresis. Approximately 350 patients per year are registered in the Department of Otorhino{Larygology of the University of Erlangen with new occurrences of this type of paresis (cf. [17] as an overview). The current way to diagnose the paresis is a subjective judgement of the functionality of the face muscles by a physician. The patient performs mimic exercises such as closing the eyes or <b>showing</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth,</b> while he is observed by the physician. The subjective observations of the physician are then graded by means of two medical indexing systems [8, 14]. One part of the rehabilitation of the patients is to perform specic mimic exercises with the face's musculature. The success of the therapy is also observed by a physician or educated clinic personal. For every observation the patient has to travel to the clinics. Furthermore, educated personal is needed for the diagnosis and rehabilitation observation of the paresis. The applications of our system are on the one hand diagnosis support in the clinics. We want to improve the subjective judgments of a physician by objective measurements and numerical features from the face. On the other hand the supervision of the rehabilitation process of the patient will be enhanced by placing the system to the patient's home. The patient can use the system in a convenient environment and does not have to travel to the clinics. The patient does not {{have to pay for the}} more convenient observation environment by wearing any articial markers inside the face and he is allowed to move in front of the system's camera. We present two dierent approaches for the analysis of facial features which will measure the face during the performance of mimic exercises. The result is a value for every picture with the level of asymmetry of the eye and mouth region which can be used to classify the facial paresis. The asymmetry of the face can be used as we handle just patients with paresis in one half of the face. This class of patients is the most frequent class. Patients wit...|$|E
