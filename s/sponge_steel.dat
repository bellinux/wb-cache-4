40|$|Wound {{healing is}} a complicated, multistep process {{involving}} many cell types, growth factors and compounds 1 - 3. Because of this complexity, wound healing studies are most comprehensive when {{carried out in}} vivo. There are many in vivo models available to study acute wound healing, including incisional, excisional, dead space, and burns. Dead space models are artificial, porous implants which are used to study tissue formation {{and the effects of}} substances on the wound. Some of the commonly used dead space models include polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) <b>sponges,</b> <b>steel</b> wire mesh cylinders, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) material, and the Cellstick 1, 2. Each dead space model has its own limitations based on its material's composition and implantation methods. The steel wire mesh cylinder model has a lag phase of infiltration after implantation and requires a long amount of time before granulation tissue formation begins 1. Later stages of wound healing are best analyzed using the ePTFE model 1, 4. The Cellstick is a cellulose sponge inside a silicon tube model which is typically used for studying human surgery wounds and wound fluid 2. The PVA sponge is limited to acute studies because with time it begins to provoke a foreign body response which causes a giant cell reaction in the animal 5. Unlike other materials, PVA sponges are easy to insert and remove, made of inert and non-biodegradable materials and yet are soft enough to be sectioned for histological analysis 2, 5...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} Aspergillus japonicus ATCC 20236 to colonize {{different}} synthetic materials (polyurethane foam, stainless <b>steel</b> <b>sponge,</b> vegetal fiber, pumice stones, zeolites, and foam glass) and to produce fructooligosaccharides (FOS) from sucrose (165 g/L) is described. Cells were immobilized in situ by absorption, through {{direct contact with}} the carrier particles at the beginning of fermentation. Vegetal fiber was the best immobilization carrier as A. japonicus grew well on it (1. 25 g/g carrier), producing 116. 3 g/L FOS (56. 3 g/L 1 -kestose, 46. 9 g/L 1 -nystose, and 13. 1 g/L 1 -β-fructofuranosyl nystose) with 69 % yield (78 % based only in the consumed sucrose amount), giving also elevated activity of the β-fructofuranosidase enzyme (42. 9 U/mL). In addition, no loss of material integrity, over a 2 day-period, was found. The fungus also immobilized well on stainless <b>steel</b> <b>sponge</b> (1. 13 g/g carrier), but in lesser extents on polyurethane foam, zeolites, and pumice stones (0. 48, 0. 19, and 0. 13 g/g carrier, respectively), while on foam glass no cell adhesion was observed. When compared with the FOS and β-fructofuranosidase production by free A. japonicus, the results achieved using cells immobilized on vegetal fiber were closely similar. It was thus concluded that A. japonicus immobilized on vegetal fiber is a potential alternative for high production of FOS at industrial scale. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPerforming {{angiography}} in the {{prone position}} {{is a difficult}} technique; however it is useful in some emergency situation. We experienced a 60 years old male who was performed lipoma excision {{on his back in}} his family doctor's clinic. Since massive arterial bleeding could not be controlled with manual astriction, he transferred to our hospital in prone position with hemodynamic instability. Operating field was not kept because of massive bleeding; therefore surgical treatment was impossible. We planed emergency arterial embolization (AE) in prone position. Hence we chose the left radial artery for vascular access. The left subclavicle arteriography showed many major and minor feeding arteries from left subclavicular and axillary arteries and a massive extravasation of the contrast medium. Three major feeding arteries were performed AE with gelatin <b>sponge</b> and <b>steel</b> coils. After AE, massive bleeding was controlled. He could discharge from our hospital on the 5 th hospital day without any complication. Arterial embolization for life-threatening bleeding from subcutaneous hypervascular tumor in the prone position is first report to our knowledge, and it is extremely rare. However we thought that this technique is useful for patients who could not turn in the supine position, e. g. massive bleeding during renal biopsy and penetrating trauma from back...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of plasma {{hemoglobin}} {{values were}} made at many different sites of a Cross-Kay disk pump oxygenator during extracorporeal bypass in patients undergoing reparative valve surgery. Hemoglobin values were always higher {{in the line of}} the aspirator and defoaming chamber than in any other part of the system. Sampling immediately proximal and distal to the defoaming chamber revealed significant increases in plasma hemoglobin values {{as a result of the}} defoaming process. Studies of the hematological effects of the defoaming agent, polymethylsiloxane, which coats the disposable stainless <b>steel</b> <b>sponge</b> in the defoaming chamber, showed it greatly reduced the resistance of red cells to lysis by mechanical trauma. Similar studies of plasma showed the hemolytic effects of the defoaming agent are to some extent mediated by the plasma. It is concluded that the widely used defoaming agent, polymethylsiloxane, contributes to the hemolytic action of the bubbling, suctioning, and defoaming processes during open heart surgery. The addition of a water soluble surfactant material, that stabilizes emulsions (Pluronic F 68), blocked or prevented the hemolytic process without inter-fering with the action of the antifoam material...|$|R
40|$|The fructooligosaccharides (FOS) {{production}} using {{immobilized cells}} of the fungus Aspergillus japonicus ATCC 20236 was evaluated. Polyurethane foam, stainless <b>steel</b> <b>sponge,</b> vegetal fiber sponge, pumice stones, zeolites and cork were tested as immobilization carrier during the fermentation under submerged conditions. Experiments were carried out in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 1 g of carrier and 100 ml of sucrose medium (165 g/l) enriched with nutrient sources. The flasks were agitated in an orbital shaker at 160 rpm, 28 °C, for 48 h. Samples were withdrawn during the fermentation to determine the consumption of sucrose, liberation of glucose and fructose to the medium, production of FOS (1 -kestose (GF 2), 1 -nystose (GF 3) and 1 [...] fructofuranosyl nystose (GF 4)) and enzymatic activity of β-fructofuranosidase. At the fermentation end, the cell mass adhered to the carrier was quantified. The microorganism adhesion to the carrier varied to each tested material. Consequently, the FOS production and enzymatic activity also varied to each medium, due to {{the differences in the}} amount of free and immobilized cells present. The highest values of immobilized cells, FOS production and enzymatic activity were achieved by using vegetal fiber sponge as immobilization carrier, while cork gave the worst results. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and b-fructofuranosidase (FFase) by immobilized cells of Penicillium expansum was evaluated. In an initial stage, different low-cost materials including synthetic fiber, polyurethane foam, stainless <b>steel</b> <b>sponge,</b> loofah sponge, and cork oak were tested as carrier for the fungus immobilization. Additionally, {{the influence of}} the inoculum age (1 or 3 weeks) on cells immobilization, FOS and FFase production was also verified. Synthetic fiber and polyurethane foam were the best materials for P. expansum immobilization (2. 21 and 1. 98 g/g carrier, respectively) and FOS production (120. 3 and 104. 8 g/l), and gave also high results of FFase activity (23. 01 and 32. 42 U/ml). Then, the {{production of}} FOS and FFase by repeated batch fermentation with P. expansum immobilized on synthetic fiber was studied, aiming to improve the batch fermentation results. The results obtained in this stage were very promising with FOS yields of 87, 72, and 44 %, in the 3 initial cycles (60 h), respectively; the FFase activity was constant throughout the process (6 cycles, 96 h). Repeated batch fermentation with immobilized cells of P. expansum was found as being a technology with great potential for FOS and FFase production on industrial scaleThe financial support from FCT, the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (research grant SFRH/BPD/ 38212 / 2007) is gratefully acknowledged...|$|R
40|$|The {{retention}} of bacteria on food contact surfaces {{increases the risk}} of cross-contamination of these microorganisms to food. The risk has been considered to be lowered when the surfaces are dry, partly because bacterial growth and survival would be reduced. However, some non-spore-forming bacteria might be able to withstand dry conditions on surfaces for an extensive period of time. In this study the survival of Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Campylobacter jejuni on stainless steel surfaces at different initial levels was determined at room temperature. The transfer rates of these pathogens from kitchen <b>sponges</b> to stainless <b>steel</b> surfaces and from these surfaces to foods were also investigated. Staph. aureus was recovered from the surfaces for at least 4 days when the contamination level was high (10 (5) CFU/cm(2)) or moderate (10 (3) CFU/cm(2)). At low levels (10 CFU/cm(2)), the surviving numbers decreased below the detection limit (4 CFU/ 100 cm(2)) within 2 days. S. enteritidis was recovered from surfaces for at least 4 days at high contamination levels, but at moderate level, the numbers decreased to the detection limit within 24 h and at low level within 1 h. C jejuni was the most susceptible to slow-air-drying on surfaces; at high contamination levels, the numbers decreased below the detection limit within 4 h. The test microorganisms were readily transmitted from the wet sponges to the stainless steel surfaces and from these surfaces to the cucumber and chicken fillet slices, with the transfer rates varied from 20 % to 100 %. This study has highlighted the fact that pathogens remain viable on dry stainless steel surfaces and present a contamination hazard for considerable periods of time, dependent on the contamination levels and type of pathogen. Systematic studies on the risks of pathogen transfer associated with surface cleaning using contaminated sponges provide quantitative data from which a model of risks assessment in domestic setting could lead.
