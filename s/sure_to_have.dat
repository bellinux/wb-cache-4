While he brought with him Elisiv, his daughters, and his son Olaf, he left behind Tora and made <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his oldest son Magnus hailed as king. Gathering his fleet at Solund in the Sognefjord, Harald departed Norway in August, and landed first in Shetland and thereafter in Orkney (both under Norwegian control). In both places he was joined by several important lords, chieftains, and soldiers, including the Earls of Orkney, Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson. He next went to Dunfermline, where he met with Tostig's ally Malcolm III of Scotland (and according to some sources, with Tostig) who allocated him a couple thousand Scottish soldiers. According to most contemporary sources, Harald and Tostig met at Tynemouth on 8 September, Harald with a total force of, at the most, around 10–15,000 men on 240–300 longships, and Tostig with a mere 12 ships with soldiers. Not mentioned in the sagas, but accounted for by John of Worcester, Tostig had departed from his exile in Flanders already in May or June. He had then raided villages along the southern coast of Britain from the Isle of Wight to Sandwich. As Harold Godwinson gathered a large army in response, Tostig sailed north to meet with Harald, while Harold Godwinson remained in the south in expectation of invasion by William of Normandy, who for a long time had openly claimed the English throne.|$|E

500|$|Banjo-Kazooie was a {{critical}} and commercial success, selling more than 1.8 million copies in the United States and more than 405,000 units in Japan. GamePro described Banjo-Kazooie as a [...] "more complex, more fluid, and more attractive game than its plumber predecessor Super Mario 64. It's <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> even the staunchest [...] critics raising their eyebrows." [...] Writing for IGN, journalist Peer Schneider felt that Banjo-Kazooie was [...] "the best 3D platformer [...] ever played, and a more than worthy successor to Super Mario 64". James Ashton of N64 Magazine highlighted the game's length, noting that the game can take 40 or 50 hours to fully complete.|$|E

D'Antonio stated about the cover of Alive or Just Breathing, [...] "I wanted something that looked 'old school cut-and-paste' for the cover.

Steve Losey of Allmusic commented that [...] " [...] has mass appeal musically and lyrically", also opining that [...] "the coolest {{part about the}} poppy hook is the ELO type vocals that penetrate the song's middle". Lauren Summerford of Jesus Freak Hideout stated that [...] "Lead single 'So Long Self' is one the best tracks Coming Up To Breathe has to offer. With a lyrical hook <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> radio listeners singing along, this song finds [...] Millard bidding farewell to sinful nature and moving closer to Christ". Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today commented that [...] "It almost seems like MercyMe is overcompensating to gain artistic credibility with the bouncy single 'So Long Self,' an undeniably catchy breakup song with our sinful nature that echoes [...] Chapman covering The Beatles, {{going so far as}} to playfully evoke a carnival in the bridge".|$|E
500|$|Presley renewed Neal's {{management}} contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser. The group maintained an extensive touring schedule throughout {{the second half}} of the year. Neal recalled, [...] "It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him. They'd get a gang and try to waylay him or something." [...] The trio became a quartet when Hayride drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of Bill Haley, whose [...] "Rock Around the Clock" [...] had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.|$|E
500|$|On 30 May Ibrahim Pasha re-entered Jerusalem and {{the next}} day Egyptian troops {{attacked}} Beit Jala, a nearby Christian village. A reported 33 men and women were killed there because of their alleged involvement in the looting of Egyptian property. The purported revenge killings were halted by Ibrahim Pasha, but the residents' livestock was seized. The next day, over 1,000 rebels from the Ta'amirah tribe entered the adjacent town of Bethlehem to protect their families and the Christian inhabitants from potentially experiencing the same fate as Beit Jala. They refrained from directly confronting Ibrahim Pasha, however. Bethlehem's Muslim Quarter was destroyed by the Egyptian army and its inhabitants disarmed. This move was apparently a punishment for the killing of a favored loyalist of Ibrahim Pasha. Reverend William McClure Thomson wrote [...] "this terrible vengeance failed to quell the turbulent spirit of the people. They are ever distinguished in the great feasts at Jerusalem by their fierce and lawless manners, and if any row occurs they are <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a hand in it." [...] The peasant rebels had frequently requested from the Christians of Bethlehem that they fight alongside them against Ibrahim Pasha's troops. The Christians refused, citing their religious beliefs and political status, and sheltered in the town's monasteries for safety. On 3 June, the rebels decided to attack the monasteries and looted the city. On 4 June rebels launched an attack on Ibrahim Pasha and about 4,000 of his men at Solomon's Pools near al-Khader.|$|E

500|$|From {{the outset}} of the marriage, {{political}} members of the Rothschild family took an interest in Rosebery, and he was soon acclaimed as one of the rising hopes of the Liberal Party. As a hereditary peer, he already had a seat in the House of Lords and had made his maiden speech there on attaining his majority. But brilliant as he was, Rosebery tended to lethargy and boredom. Lord Granville in fact considered Rosebery's wife to be the more ambitious of the pair, and even advised her [...] "If you keep him up to the mark, [...] is <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his page in history." [...] The subtle driving of her often languid and lethargic husband to achieve his [...] "page in history" [...] was to become her [...] Rosebery's secretary Thomas Gilmour noted: [...] "She is thoroughly genuine and very tender and devoted to Lord Rosebery, {{it is easy to see}} that she is very proud of him, and she is a woman of considerable force of character and great energy, she may prove to be a powerful ally in his political career." [...] Rosebery was not a natural politician. He was an idealist who disliked the rancour of politics, in fact [...] "his innate dislike of politics was something Lady Rosebery always fought against." [...] However, he was a gifted orator, and this was an era when platform speaking was beginning to replace House of Commons debate. On a tour of America before his marriage, Rosebery had been impressed by the campaigning of prospective political candidates; in Britain little had changed in that respect since the hustings of the 18th century. He realised how an electorate could be swayed by a candidate touring his prospective constituency, aided by a well thought-out series of events, rallies and advertising, with the candidate's ideal and attractive family smiling by his side. Thus Lady Rosebery not only pushed and encouraged him behind the scenes but was now to become an encouraging and conspicuous figure by his side. In this way it could be said she was the first openly [...] "political wife" [...] in Britain.|$|E
