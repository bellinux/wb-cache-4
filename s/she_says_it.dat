500|$|Several {{critics have}} called Burger's Daughter a Bildungsroman, or coming-of-age story, {{although}} not the traditional ones which, according to Susan Gardner {{in her essay}} [...] "Still Waiting for the Great Feminist Novel", are dominated by male protagonists. While Gordimer was not a feminist author and Burger's Daughter is not a feminist novel, Gardner suggests that the book has [...] "a discernible woman-concerned subtext", making it [...] "impossible for feminists to dismiss or ignore". <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> has [...] "a potential feminist awareness" [...] that is [...] "obscured by more conventional patriarchal writing codes". Yelin writes that {{after the death of}} Rosa's mother, the statement [...] "Already she had taken on her mother's role in the household, giving loving support to her father" [...] illustrates [...] "the continuing hegemony of bourgeois-patriarchal ideology" [...] in the novel. Yelin suggests that this inconsistency is responsible for Rosa's struggle, the [...] "contradiction between feminism (Rosa's liberation as a woman) and the struggle for justice in South Africa".|$|E

500|$|Residents of Athens {{were divided}} into three classes: Athenians, metics, and slaves. [...] Each of these classes had {{different}} rights and obligations: for instance, Athenians could not be made slaves, while metics could. [...] Nicole Loraux writes that Athenian women were not considered citizens. This is not universally accepted, however. [...] Eva Cantarella disagrees, arguing that both of the Greek words used to denote citizenship, aste and politis, were {{used to refer to}} Athenian women. [...] Josine Blok argues that military and political service were not prerequesites of citizenship; instead, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>it</b> was participation in the cultic life of the polis which made a person a citizen. [...] Thus, according to Blok Athenian men and women were both considered citizens. [...] Similarly, Cynthia Patterson says that while the English word [...] "citizen" [...] connotes sharing in political and judicial rights, the equivalent Classical Athenian concepts were more about [...] "being a member of the Athenian family". [...] She thus argues that the English words [...] "citizen" [...] and [...] "citizenship" [...] are best avoided when discussing Classical Athenian concepts.|$|E

She later worked on these tracks in Trinidad, where she absorbed influences from the country's love of soca music. The lyrics of [...] "Boyz" [...] {{deal with the}} artist's time in Jamaica, and reference Jamaican dance moves. The song [...] "Hussel" [...] began as an image in M.I.A.'s head of refugees being smuggled in boats, which she expressed musically by imagining how [...] "if they banged that beat {{on the side of}} a boat, what would it sound like? [...] That's why it's all echo-y and submarine-y". The sounds on the intro were recorded from Keralan [...] fishermen chanting as they pull their fishing boats into the water. [...] "World Town" [...] used instrumentation from the temple music she recalled waking up to as a child in Sri Lanka. After playing the track to children in Liberia, she expressed a desire to record a video for the song there. M.I.A.'s [...] "flat, unaffected vocals and delivery of lyrics" [...] on some songs drew comparisons to British post-punk bands such as Delta 5 and The Slits. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> [...] "was just what was happening to me naturally...I wanted it to be difficult and raw and not get into it so much".|$|E

Brian is traumatized for no reason after finding out about Ida and, when he hears Quagmire come inside the house, he tries to hide under Peter and Lois' bed, but Quagmire finds him easily, because Brian's feet were sticking out from under the bed, and brutally beats him, thus threatening to blow his head off if he goes near Quagmire's house.

500|$|Magnus [...] "adores her {{daughter}} Ashley, respecting her independence and self-reliance – but that doesn't preclude some occasional mother-daughter friction". Tapping {{has said that}} there is a [...] "huge amount of respect" [...] between the two characters, adding [...] "Ashley knows that when her mother says she needs to do something then <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> for a reason. And Magnus has a huge amount of respect for Ashley because Ashley can do things that she can't." [...] Magnus made a hard choice of having Ashley even though she does not have her mother's longevity, and Magnus would outlive {{her daughter}}. In the first season Magnus recruits Will as her protégé. When asked what Magnus thinks of Will, Tapping stated [...] "I think Helen finds him fascinating. He's so idealistic, she sees in him all the qualities that she admires, but all the qualities that she knows will probably get beaten out of him over the course of time. His idealism and purity of thought and the way he analyses things... she absolutely respects that, but I think she also realises that there's going to come a time when he's going to become a bit jaded... There are a couple of episodes where there's been this bizarre sexual tension between the two of them... but generally there's just a huge healthy respect." [...] During a Blastr interview in 2011, Tapping further explains Magnus' relationship with Will; [...] "I love how this relationship has developed. [...] "It's been a really organic transformation of Will's character and Magnus. To actually bring somebody on board who, initially, it's all about teaching him the ropes. And then as the seasons have gone on he's come into his own. He's come into his own as a scientist. He's come into his own in terms of his relationship with the people in the Sanctuary." [...] Dunne meanwhile stated [...] "there's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters. And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of." ...|$|E
