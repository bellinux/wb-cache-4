Therefore, it is an intractable as well as challenging task to improve the water level control system of the SG. In this study, a new framework for building an adaptive Minimum Variance controller for stabilizing water-level of SG is proposed. We use the recursive least squares algorithm to identify the Input/Output models. Minimum Variance Control (MVC) law is also used to develop the adaptation controller. Emphasis is put on the evaluation of the parameter identification in order to avoid instabilities because of disturbances or insufficient excitations. This is especially of importance when the adaptive control is carried out in closed loop systems and without additional test signals.

40|$|The NISCO Cogeneration {{facility}} utilizes two {{fluidized bed}} boilers to generate 200 MW {{of electricity and}} up to 80, 000 LBS/HR of steam for process use. The partnership, of three industrial electricity users, Citgo, Conoco, and Vista Chemical, and the local utility, Gulf States utilities, was formed in the late 1980 's. In August and September 1992 two fluidized bed boilers were brought into operation to repower existing turbine generating equipment. The fluidized bed units were designed to utilize 100 percent petroleum coke, a locally produced fuel. Petroleum coke is a high heating value, low volatile, high sulfur fuel which is difficult to utilize in conventional boilers. It is readily available in most areas throughout the world, including North and South America. Because of superior environmental performance, lower capital cost, and fuel versatility, circulating fluidized bed boilers were selected to repower the existing turbines. Fluidized bed boilers were ideally suited for a repowering application. Existing equipment matched or was modified for utilization in the project optimizing capital cost. The fluidized bed boilers, designed and fabricated by Foster Wheeler, are each capable of producing 825, 000 LBS/HR of steam. This paper describes the results attained at NISCO during the first full year of operation. The design attributes of the project which enabled a successful and efficient unit startup are explained.

Additionally, the agency held that situation-specific factors, such as implementation and compliance costs, {{should not be}} considered when designating EGUs for regulation. In White Stallion Energy Center, LLC v. U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C.

Residual oil fly ash (ROFA) samples were analyzed for nickel (Ni) concentrations and speciation using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction (XRD), and a water-soluble Ni extraction method. ROFA water extraction residues were also analyzed for Ni speciation using XAFS and XRD. Total Ni concentrations in the ROFAs were similar, ranging from 1. 3 to 1. 5 wt%; however, stack gas Ni concentrations in the Unit A were {approx} 990 {micro}g/Nm{sup 3 } compared to {approx} 620 {micro}g/Nm{sup 3 } for Unit B because of the greater residual oil feed rates employed at Unit A to attain higher load (i. e., MW) conditions with a lower heating value oil. Ni speciation analysis results indicate that ROFAs from Unit A contain about 3 wt% NiSO{sub 4 } {center_dot} xH{sub 2 }O (where x is assumed to be 6 for calculation purposes) and a Ni-containing spinel compound, similar in composition to (Mg,Ni) (Al,Fe) {sub 2 }O{sub 4 }. ROFAs from Unit B contain on average 2. 0 wt% NiSO{sub 4 } {center_dot} 6 H{sub 2 }O and 1. 1 wt% NiO. XAFS and XRD analyses did not detect any nickel sulfide compounds, including nickel subsulfide (Ni{sub 3 }S{sub 2 }) (XAFS detection limit is 5 % of the total Ni concentration).

40|$|McDermott Technology, Inc. (a {{subsidiary}} of Babcock & Wilcox) is conducting the Advanced Emissions Control Development Project (AECDP) which {{is aimed at}} the development of practical, cost-effective strategies for reducing the emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) from coal-fired electric utility plants. The need for such controls may arise as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proceeds with implementation of requirements {{set forth in the}} Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA`s) of 1990. Promulgation of air toxics emissions regulations for electric utility plants could dramatically impact utilities burning coal, their industrial and residential customers, and the coal industry. AECDP project work will supply the information needed by utilities to respond to potential HAPs regulations in a timely, cost-effective, enviromnentally-sound manner which supports the continued use of the Nation`s abundant reserves of coal, such as those in the State of Ohio. The development work is being carried out using the 10 MW Clean Environment Development Facility wherein air toxics emissions control strategies can be developed under controlled conditions. The specific objectives of the project are to (1) measure and understand production and partitioning of air toxics species for a variety of coals, (2) optimize the air toxics removal performance of conventional flue gas cleanup systems, (3) develop advanced air toxics emissions control concepts, (4) develop and validate air toxics emissions measurement and monitoring techniques, and (5) establish a comprehensive, self-consistent air toxics data library. This project is supported by the Department of Energy, the Ohio Coal Development Office within the Ohio Department of Development and Babcock & Wilcox. A comprehensive assessment of HAP emissions from coal-fired electric utility boilers sponsored by the Department of Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute concluded that with the exception of selenium and mercury, the majority of trace elements are well controlled due to their association with the particulate phase of flue gas. Reflecting the current focus of the US EPA and state environmental agencies on mercury as a potential candidate for regulation, the project specifically targets the measurement and control of mercury species. This paper discusses the results of testing on the quantity and species distribution of mercury while firing Ohio high-sulfur coal to assess the mercury emissions control potential of conventional SO{sub 2 } and particulate control systems. Results from recent AECDP tests are presented and two alternative mercury speciation methods are compared.

EPA's conclusions and recommendations were presented in the ''Mercury Study Report to Congress'' and ''Study of Hazardous Air Pollutant Emissions from Electric Utility <b>Steam</b> <b>Generating</b> Units''. The first report addressed both the human health and environmental effects of anthropogenic mercury emissions, while the second addressed the risk to public health posed by the emission of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from <b>steam</b> electric <b>generating</b> <b>units.</b> Although these reports did not state that mercury controls on coal-fired electric power stations would be required given {{the current state of the}} art, they did indicate that the EPA views mercury as a potential threat to human health. Therefore, it was concluded that mercury controls at some point may be necessary. EPA also indicated that additional research/information was necessary before any definitive statement could be made. In an effort to determine the amount and types of mercury being emitted into the atmosphere by coal-fired power plants, EPA in late 1998 issued an information collection request (ICR) that required all coal-fired power plants to analyze their coal and submit the results to EPA on a quarterly basis. In addition, about 85 power stations were required to measure the speciated mercury concentration in the flue gas. These plants were selected on the basis of plant configuration and coal type. The Valmont Station owned and operated by New Century Energy in Boulder, Colorado, was selected for detailed mercury speciation of the flue gas as part of the ICR process.

Department of Energy, contracted with the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) to do a study evaluating the behavior of mercury at the Valmont Station. The activities conducted at the Valmont Station by the EERC not only included the sampling needed to meet the requirements of the ICR, but involved a much more extensive mercury research program. The following objectives for the sampling at New Century Energy's Valmont Station were accomplished: (1) Successfully complete all of the mercury sampling and reporting requirements of the ICR. (2) Determine the variability in mercury concentrations at the stack using mercury continuous emission monitors (CEMs). (3) Calculate mercury mass balances and emission rates. (4) Determine the mercury concentration in the fly ash as a function of particle size. (5) Determine the impact of a fabric filter on mercury emissions for a western bituminous coal...|$|R
40|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) ’s {{announcement}} {{that it will}} revise the effluent limitation guidelines for <b>steam</b> electric power <b>generating</b> <b>units</b> could affect not only how power plants use water, but also how they discharge it. The revised guidelines may lower discharge limits for various contaminants in flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater including mercury, selenium, arsenic, and nitrate/nitrite. Although the specific details of the guidelines are unknown at present, the power industry is evaluating various technologies that may address the new effluent limitation guidelines and promote water conservation. Moreover, the power industry is looking for avenues to increase water usage efficiency, reuse and recycle throughout its plant processes. Final rule approval is expected {{by the middle of}} 2014 and new regulations are expected to be implemented between 2017 and 2022 through 5 -year NPDES permit cycles. A growing interest exists in zero liquid discharge (ZLD) facilities and processes in power plant operations. Potentially stringent discharge limits along with water conservation and reuse efforts are two of the major drivers to achieve ZLD. Potential pollutant levels are so low that ZLD may be the best option, if not an outright requirement. A key disadvantage of thermal ZLD is its high capital cost. One way to reduce this cost is to pre-treat the liquid stream using innovative membrane technologies and reverse osmosis (RO) ...|$|R
