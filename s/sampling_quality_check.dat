30|$|The {{preparation}} of PMF pollen {{samples from the}} filter pads and the liquid collected in the flasks was carried out according to VDI-guideline 4330 Part 3 (2007) using ultrasonic and vacuum filtration to sediment the sample as filter cake on acetyl-ethylene membrane filters (12 -µm pore size, 50  mm diameter, sterile and free of DNA). <b>Sample</b> <b>quality</b> was <b>checked</b> by examining the filter cakes with pollen samples on the membrane filters under the binocular microscope and documented by digital microphotography. The bioaerosol samples (from filter cake) were transferred into a 15  ml tube free of DNA. After centrifugation (2, 000 rotations/min [rpm](~ 500  g), 5 min) the volume was reduced to 2  ml, and 2  ml of glycerol was added leading to 4  ml of 50  % glycerol pollen suspension (density 1.1  g/cm³). The pollen suspension was then mixed with a shaker and subsamples for the various analyses were taken and stored until subsequent analysis at – 20 C.|$|R
30|$|All {{deposition}} data {{analyzed in}} this study were obtained in the same way according to the VDI standard 4330 - 3 [46] specific for maize [47] as follows: the pollen samples were removed from the filter pads of the PMF and from the liquid in the 1.5 -L attached flask by using an ultrasonic bath (Sonorex Bandelin Super RK 102, BANDELIN electronic GmbH & Co. KG, Berlin, Germany) and vacuum filtration (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). These procedures sedimented the aerosol particle sample as a filter cake on an acetyl-ethylene membrane filter (12 μm pore size, 50 mm diameter, Whatman, Maidstone, UK), after pre-filtering the liquid through a 125 -μm metal mesh test sieve (100 mm diameter, Fritsch, Idar-Oberstein, Germany). <b>Sample</b> <b>quality</b> was <b>checked</b> by examining the filter cakes under a binocular microscope. A sample from each filter cake was transferred into a 15 -ml tube. After centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min), the volume was reduced to 2 ml. Then, 2 ml glycerol was added to give 4 ml 50 % glycerol pollen suspension (density 1.1 g/cm 3). The pollen suspension was mixed with a shaker and stored at − 20 °C until subsequent analysis.|$|R
30|$|DNA and RNA were {{extracted}} from triplicate microcosms with either soil-compost mixture (with and without pyrene treatment) at incubation days 0, 35, 48 and 160 and from microcosms with fertilized soil (with and without pyrene treatment) at incubation day 46. Total DNA and total RNA were consecutively {{extracted from}} 2  g of each soil or soil-compost sample using the RNA PowerSoil Total RNA Isolation Kit {{in combination with}} the RNA PowerSoil DNA Elution Accessory Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, USA). The extraction was performed following the manufacturer`s instructions with the one exception that the final RNA pellet was resuspended in 50  µl pure formamide for storage. DNA and RNA <b>samples</b> were <b>quality</b> <b>checked</b> by 1.2 % formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis and kept at − 80  °C until further analysis. In order to obtain the substantial amounts of RNA which are necessary to obtain reliable results, RNA extracted from triplicate soil-compost mixtures had to be pooled. Pooling the triplicate RNA extracts limited the informative value of the statistical procedures. RNA results are therefore shown for comparison with DNA results. For community sequencing cDNA was synthesized from RNA samples. Detailed information on the cDNA synthesis is given in the Additional file 1. 1  µl of the DNA or cDNA solution was used for Illumina sequencing (as described later on).|$|R
40|$|Full {{waveform}} sonic logging {{is routinely}} {{applied in the}} oil industry practice. The primary and secondary waves inform about the porosity, elastic parameters and the orientation of in-situ stresses acting around the borehole. The separation of Stoneley waves propagating in the drillhole enables to determine the permeability of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Permeability is generally estimated from the inversion processing of Stoneley interval transit-time data. Statistical methods can also be found in the literature, which offer quicker and simpler solution with revealing the empirical relationships between the characteristic data of Stoneley waves and permeability. These methods do not require the prior knowledge of porosity. Case studies assume a linear connection between the relative decrease in Stoneley-wave’s velocity of porous formations and the natural logarithm of permeability, which usually gives only a rough estimate. In this study, the regression model is improved by the determination of a more accurate nonlinear relationship between Stoneley wave slowness and permeability. The new algorithm is tested over a wide domains of petrophysical parameters using an exactly known permeability model and synthetic well logs. The exponential model is also applied to the statistical processing of real well-logging data, where the estimated permeability log is compared to laboratory data measured on core <b>samples.</b> The <b>quality</b> <b>checks</b> of synthetic and field results show that the application of the nonlinear model is highly recommended to get a more accurate and reliable estimation of hydrocarbon reserves...|$|R
30|$|To {{cover all}} {{objectives}} stated before, three {{different sets of}} data are used. The first aim is to improve compositional gradient prediction by utilizing suitable correlations for calculating molecular diffusion coefficients in gas mixture. For this purpose, a set of data from a gas condensate reservoir reported by Ghorayeb and Firoozabadi (2000) is employed which is shown in Table 1. In part 2, a sample from a supergiant gas condensate reservoir is chosen that is presented in Table 2. This sample is selected among more than 40 PVT <b>samples</b> after passing <b>quality</b> <b>check</b> based on procedure proposed by Osfouri et al. (2014). This set of data is interested because study on the compositional gradient of this supergiant reservoir {{is a part of}} comprehensive study on phase behavior of this gas condensate field. For the last part, as compositional gradient is more notable in volatile oil compare with other types of oil such as slightly volatile or black oil a volatile oil sample is selected from data reported by Hamoodi et al. (1996) refer to Table 3.|$|R

It {{was found that}} the crystal quality is very sensitive to oxygen partial pressure applied during growth and highly Ca doped crystals could only be obtained at elevated oxygen pressure. Whereas a secondary phase was observed for PrCa 2 Mn 2 O 7 grown at oxygen partial pressure below 1 bar, a pure phase can be achieved at 8 bar of oxygen.

Data <b>quality</b> <b>check</b> plots are produced daily and are accessible through a MAGIC internal web page to provide useful information about the telescopes and to pinpoint a possible failure or degradation of the performance. Each morning, a dedicated analyzer checks the automatically produced daily check report and alerts the experts in case of any major anomaly that could affect the data quality. In addition, for each data run a hardware data quality bit is generated, indicating the hardware status of the entire system as well as a weather quality bit.

Results: In Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Enugu, Kogi and Ogun States, a total of 415, 315, 231, 206 and 428 week 8 slides respectively were studied (a grand total of 1595 slides studied).
