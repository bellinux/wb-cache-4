40|$|For {{assessing}} {{the degree of}} population subdivision, and therefore {{the extent to which}} group selection might favor an altruistic trait, an appropriate measure is Nei's GST, defined by (F 0 -F) /(1 -F). F 0 is the probability that two alleles drawn from the same group are identical in state and F is the probability for two alleles drawn at random from the entire population. These probabilities can be assessed from molecular polymorphisms. GST has a number of properties that make it useful for empirical studies. When the mutation rate is small relative to the migration rate and the reciprocal of the group size, GST depends mainly on the absolute number of migrants per generation, moves rapidly to near equilibrium, and is independent of the number of alleles. The relative homogenizing effect of migration in the island and stepping-stone models is not as different as might be expected; one immigrant chosen randomly {{from the rest of the}} population is only one to two times as effective as one from a neighboring group, appreciably exceeding 2 only when there are 1000 or more groups.

40|$|A new rapid {{automated}} {{method for}} {{the identification and}} classification of microorganisms is described. It {{is based on the}} incorporation of 35 S-methionine into cellular proteins and subsequent separation of the radiolabelled proteins by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The protein patterns produced were species specific and reproducible, permitting discrimination between the species. A large number of Gram negative and Gram positive aerobic and anaerobic organisms were successfully tested. Furthermore, there were sufficient differences within species between the protein profiles to <b>permit</b> <b>subdivision</b> of the species. New typing schemes for Clostridium difficile, coagulase negative staphylococci, and Staphylococcus aureus, including the methicillin resistant strains, could thus be introduced; this has provided the basis for useful epidemiological studies. To standardise and automate the procedure an automated electrophoresis system and a two dimensional scanner were developed to scan the dried gels directly. The scanner is operated by a computer which also stores and analyses the scan data. Specific histograms are produced for each bacterial species. Pattern recognition software is used to construct databases and to compare data obtained from different gels: in this way duplicate "unknowns" can be identified. Specific small areas showing differences between various histograms can also be isolated and expanded to maximise the differences, thus providing differentiation between closely related bacterial species and the identification of differences within the species to provide new typing schemes.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The Greenland ice sheet {{is treated as}} a monomineralic rock formation, primarily metamorphic, but with a sedimentary veneer of snow and firn. This sedimentary member is perennial above the firn line, and the classical methods of stratigraphy and sedimentation can be profitably applied to it. During a 4 -year period 146 pit studies and 288 supplementary Rammsonde profiles were made along 1100 miles of over-snow traverse (Fig. 1). Temperature, density, ram hardness, and grain size were measured in the strata exposed in each pit. Stratification of snow results from variations in the conditions of deposition and is emphasized by subsequent diagenesis. Summer layers are coarser-grained and have generally lower density and hardness values than winter layers; they may also show evidence of surface melt. The onset of fall is usually identified by an abrupt increase in density and hardness accompanied by a decrease in grain size. This stratigraphic discontinuity is used as the annual reference plane. Strata in the upper 10 to 20 meters compose a succession of annual sequences which are preserved in recognizable form for at least several decades. Correlation of annual layers between pits, spaced 10 to 25 miles apart along the traverse of Figure 1, gives a picture of annual accumulation during the past 5 to 20 years for western Greenland between 69 and 77 °N. The control established by these data, together with information from earlier expeditions (primarily those of Koch-Wegener and DeQuervain) and from permanent coastal meteorological stations, {{have been used to}} make a map showing the distribution of gross annual accumulation, essentially the equivalent of annual precipitation, for the entire ice sheet (Fig. 30). In general, the accumulation contours follow the north-south trend of the coast lines, with extremes of less than 10 cm H 2 O in the northeast and more than 90 cm H 2 O per year in the south; the average for the ice sheet is 34 cm H 2 O per year. The zone of maximum precipitation lies close to the coast in two regions, one on the east coast between Angmagssalik and Scoresbysund, the other on the west coast between Upernavik and Thule. In addition to the existence of a useful stratigraphic record four diagenetic facies are recognized on the ice sheet. (1) The ablation facies extends from the outer edge, or terminus, of the glacier to the firn line. The firn line is the highest elevation to which the annual snow cover recedes during the melt season. (2) The soaked facies becomes wet throughout during the melting season and extents from the firn line to the saturation line, i. e., the uppermost limit of complete wetting. The saturation line is the highest altitude at which the 0 °C isothermal surface penetrates to the melt surface of the previous summer. (3) The percolation facies is subjected to localized percolation of melt water from the surface without becoming wet throughout. Percolation can occur in snow and firn of sub-freezing temperatures with only the pipe-like percolation channels being at the melting point. A network of ice glands, lenses, and layers forms when refreezing occurs. This facies extends from the saturation line to the upper limit of surface melting, the dry-snow line. Negligible soaking and percolation occur above the dry-snow line. (4) The dry-snow facies includes all of the glacier lying above the dry-snow line, and negligible melting occurs in it. The saturation line can be identified by discontinuities in temperature, density, and ram hardness data, and it may also be located by examination of melt evidence in strata exposed on pit walls. It is as sharply defined as the firn line; but the dry-snow line, although determined by the same methods, is an ill-defined transition zone 10 - to 20 -miles wide. The facies represent a response to climate, therefore changes in the location of facies boundaries may be used as indicators of secular climatic change. Since facies are not restricted to the Greenland ice sheet, they provide the basis for a general classification of glaciers. This "facies classification" is areal in nature and gives a greater resolution of characteristics than Ahlmann's "geophysical classification. " In particular, the "facies classification" <b>permits</b> <b>subdivision</b> of large glaciers which span the entire range of environments from temperate to polar. Ahlmann's useful distinction between temperate and polar glaciers takes on new meaning in the light of glacier facies. Thus, a temperate glacier exhibits only the two facies below the saturation line whereas {{one or both of the}} facies above the saturation line are present on polar glaciers. An attempt has been made to map the distribution of facies on the Greenland ice sheet (Fig. 48). The distribution of mean annual temperature on the ice sheet may be approximated by gradients with respect to altitude and latitude of 1 °C/ 100 m and 1 °C per degree latitude respectively. The altitude gradient is controlled by strong outgoing radiation, producing deep inversions and katabatic winds. The katabatic winds are warmed adiabatically as they descend along the surface of the ice sheets and this is the primary control determining the temperature gradient along the snow surface. The latitude gradient is based on temperature measurements made above 2000 m on the ice sheets and on average values from meteorological stations spanning 20 ° of latitude on the west coast. A contour map of isotherms based on these gradients compares well with temperature values obtained from pits on the ice sheet. (Fig. 40). The densification of snow and firn is discussed for the case where melting is negligible. The assumption is that accumulation remains constant at a given location and, under this assumption, the depth-density curve is invariant with time as stated by Sorge's law. As a layer is buried it moves through a pressure gradient under steady-state conditions, and it is assumed that the decrease in pore space with increasing load is simply proportional to the pore spaces, i. e., [ [...] . ] where [ [...] . ] = specific volume of firn ([ [...] . ] = firn density), [ [...] . ] = specific volume of ice = 1. 09 cm 3 /g, [ [...] . ] = load at depth z below the snow surface and m = a constant which depends on the mechanism of densification. The depth-density equation obtained from equation 8 is [ [...] . ] where K = [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ] = void ratio for snow of density [ [...] . ], and [ [...] . ] = void ratio for snow of density [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ] = density of snow when [ [...] . ] = 0. The consequences of the assumption in equation 8 compare favorably with observation. A fundamental change in the mechanism of densification is recognized within 10 m of the snow surface. The concept of a "critical density" is introduced. Before the density of snow attains the critical value it is compacted primarily by packing of the grains. The critical density represents the maximum value obtainable by packing and further compaction must proceed by other mechanisms. The rate of change of volume with increasing load decreases by a factor of 4 when the critical density is exceeded. The same equations hold in the case where melt is not negligible but the rates of densification are higher. Bauer's (1955) estimate for the balance of the ice sheet is revised. Two corrections are applied: (1) the average annual accumulation value of 31 cm H 2 O originally estimated by Loewe (1936) is revised to 34 cm H 2 O as a result of this study; (2) the relative areas of ablation and accumulation zones in Greenland north of 76 °N are more accurately defined. The net result is a slightly positive balance which is interpreted to mean that the Greenland ice sheet is essentially in equilibrium with present day climate...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 : Monitoring Response to Single-Dose (1000 cGy) Radiotherapy in a RIF- 1 Tumor Model The current {{standard}} of measure for monitoring chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic treatment response is tumor volume. Unfortunately, changes in tumor volume are generally slow and tumor volume {{does not necessarily}} indicate the degree of tumor viability. The development of marker(s) {{with the ability to}} detect an early therapeutic response would greatly aid in patient management, opening the possibility for both rapid dose optimization and replacement of ineffective therapies with alternative treatment. Previous studies have shown that diffusion measurements using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are sensitive to therapy-induced changes in cellular structure, allowing demarcation between regions of necrosis and viable tumor tissue. This sensitivity, based on the correlation between water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and tumor cellular density, may allow diffusion measurements to be employed in non-invasive monitoring of treatment response. Therapy-induced increases in tumor ADC preceding tumor regression have been reported in a variety of experimental tumor models and several human brain tumors. Despite the demonstrated diffusion sensitivity to therapeutic response in these particular studies, shortcomings still remain that hinder the efficacy of clinical application in oncology. Earlier studies have concentrated on the mean ADC present within the tumor, either within the entire tumor volume or a region of-interest (ROI) defined by the user, and their evolution pre-treatment and post-treatment. Because of inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity, volume-averaged ADC measurements suffer from poor correlation with treatment efficacy. In addition, most studies make little or no attempt to characterize the entire tumor volume (necrotic, viable, edema). The identification of regions of differing tissue viability should aid in the staging of treatment, therefore making accurate and reproducible tissue segmentation an important goal. The results of earlier, single-parameter studies indicate that a multi-parametric approach in which several MR parameters are monitored (ADC, T 2, M 0) may provide greater power than that of the single parameter approach. A multi-parametric or multi-spectral (MS) analysis uses pattern-recognition techniques, such as clustering, for image segmentation. Clustering algorithms use characteristics of the multiple MR-parameter dataset to group tissue of similar type, e. g., fat, muscle, viable tumor, necrosis. Specifically, k-means (KM) is an unsupervised segmentation algorithm that groups together similar tissue based on the difference in MR parameter space between the image voxel of interest and the mean parameter values of the voxels in that cluster. In the first step of the classification algorithm, it is applied to separate the data into two clusters (k = 2), tissue and background noise voxels. All voxels classified as background noise are set to zero and removed from further processing. In the second step, KM is applied to the remaining tissue voxels to segment the data into multiple tissue types. In the case of tumors, it is not clear in advance how many different types of tissue exist. The number of clusters, k, should be varied to ensure that all relationships between tissues are found. In the final step, the resulting KM maps may be compared to histological slices taken from the same tissue as the imaging slices in order to identify the tissue type of each cluster. In line with the studies and analyses described above, quantitative MRI was performed to investigate the spatial correlation between ADC, spin-spin (T 2) relaxation times, and proton density (M 0) in murine radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF- 1) tumors following single-dose (l 000 cGy) radiotherapy using the KM algorithm (Chapters 3 and 4) and different combinations of features and/or clusters. For all cluster/feature combinations, an in-depth comparison between KM-derived volume estimates and conventional histology via the hematoxylin-eosin (H 2 ̆ 6 E) staining procedure (for identification of viable tumor versus necrosis), as well as via hypoxic-inducible factor-lα. (HIF- 1 α) immunohistochemistry (for identification of regions of hypoxia versus well-oxygenated tissue) was performed (Chapter 3). The optimal cluster/feature combination was determined by minimizing the sum-of-squared-differences (SSD) between the actual datapoints and the ideal one-to-one correlation that should exist between KM-derived volume estimates and histology-derived volume estimates. The optimal cluster/feature combination was determined to be a 2 -feature (ADC, T 2) and 4 -c 1 uster (2 regions each of viable tissue and necrosis) segmentation. This KM method was then applied in analysis of the radiotherapeutic response: first, to gain insight into the various processes whose combination yield the total ADC response over time; second, to identify the contribution of tissue heterogeneity to the treatment response and changes in tumor growth kinetics and cell kill (Chapter 4). Comparisons between control and various time-points out to 14 days post-radiotherapy permitted more accurate tissue characterization and prediction of therapeutic outcome over analysis using ADC alone. The results based on histological validation demonstrated: (1) MS analysis provides an improved tissue segmentation method over results obtained from conventional methods employing ADC alone; (2) MS analysis <b>permits</b> <b>subdivision</b> based on the degree of necrosis, as well as delineation between well-oxygenated and hypoxic viable tissue; and (3) Individual KM volumes corresponded well with both H 2 ̆ 6 E volumes and regions with increased HIF- 1 α expression. The results based on the radiotherapeutic response demonstrated: (1) MS analysis provides a method for monitoring the range of tissue viability as a function of time post-treatment; (2) MS analysis permits assessment of the various contributions to the total ADC response post-treatment; (3) The relative fractions of well-oxygenated (i. e., radiosensitive) versus hypoxic (i. e., radioresistant) tissue pretreatment may be predictive of treatment response; and (4) The early ADC increase {{did not seem to be}} a result of radiation-induced vasogenic edema, but instead was most likely due to a slight reduction in cellular density following therapy. These studies provide a non-invasive method of tissue characterization that may be used in monitoring treatment response and optimizing drug dose-timing schemes, with the potential for predicting treatment efficacy. Part 2 : Role of Spreading Depression in Ischemic Stroke Stroke is a prevalent disease that ranks as the 3 rd leading cause of death and disability in the United States, according to NIH statistics, costing millions of dollars in medical costs and lost wages. At present, the mechanism by which focal ischemia evolves into infarction remains poorly understood. By determining the patho-physiological mechanisms involved in the evolution of focal brain ischemia, therapeutic strategies may be designed for instances of acute ischemic stroke. In the late 1980 s, researchers discovered MRI techniques that allow the detection of stroke very early after onset. Such techniques as diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging (DWI and PWI) have been applied both clinically and experimentally. Previous studies employing these techniques suggest that cortical spreading depression plays a detrimental role in the evolution of focal brain ischemia. Spreading depression (SD) is characterized by a spontaneous and reversible depression of cortical electrical activity that spreads from the site of onset as a wave with a speed of 2 - 5 mm/min. It is accompanied by an ionic redistribution, with efflux of potassium ions (K+) and influx of sodium, chloride, and calcium (Na+, Cl-, Ca 2 +) ions, as well as water. This results in cellular swelling and a decreased extracellular space (ES), yielding a decline in ADC. A positive correlation between the number of both spontaneous and induced SDs and infarct volume has well been documented, supporting the idea that SD inhibition might be neuroprotective if initiated early after ischemic onset. Even though these studies show promise in their ability to track SD using diffusion mapping, changes in ADCs reflect cytotoxic edema and do not necessarily correspond to SD or SD-like depolarizations or calcium (Ca 2 +) influx, leading to cell death. Recent studies have reported the use of manganese ions (Mn 2 +) as a depolarization-dependent contrast agent in monitoring brain activation through the application of glutamate, as well as in the study focal ischemia. Since extracellular accumulation of potassium (K+) ions or glutamate in ischemic tissue is believed to play a central role in the initiation and propagation of SDs, and knowing that Mn 2 +, having an ionic radius similar to that of Ca 2 +, is handled in a manner similar to Ca 2 +, these studies suggest the possible use of manganese ions (Mn 2 +) in tracking SD or SD-like depolarizations in the evolution of focal brain ischemia. In order to determine the utility of Mn 2 + as a marker for SD, two sets of T 1 -weighted MRI experiments were performed before applying Mn 2 + in an experimental stroke model (Chapter 6). First, for verification purposes, a glutamate administration group was evaluated to validate our use of the manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) method previously developed by Aoki et al, a modification of the original by Lin and Koretsky. When satisfied that the contrast enhancement was specific to glutamate only, a second set of experiments was performed. Here, experimental SD was elicited by chemical stimulation (direct application of concentrated potassium chloride [KC 1] on the exposed cortical surface) and compared with control conditions (perfusion of sodium chloride [NaC 1] on exposed brain cortex). This study demonstrated: (1) Mn 2 +, specific to Ca 2 + channel activity, is a more accurate marker for SD than DWI or T 2 methods; (2) Cortical restriction of MEMRI enhancement supports the contention that apical dendrites are necessary for SD propagation; (3) Subcortical enhancement is a result of corticalsubcortical neuronal connectivity; and (4) Because of the relatively slow clearance of Mn 2 +, MEMRI permits higher spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) via increased signal averaging. Based on these results, preliminary experiments involving the study of SD in focal ischemia using Mn 2 + were performed (Chapter 7). Initial results indicate: (1) MEMRI of ischemia, when compared with standard DWI/PWI methods, may provide a method for estimating the likelihood of progression to infarct at acute time points post onset of stroke. These studies provide a foundation for further investigation into the role of SD in stroke, and the application of Mn 2 + towards the design of therapeutic strategies targeting SD inhibition. Conclusions and Medical Significance The research within this dissertation employed magnetic resonance imaging techniques for monitoring the temporal evolution of pathological disease states such as focal ischemia and cancer, with and without therapeutic intervention. Optimization of these techniques in experimental models will open the possibility for future application in a clinical setting. Clinical availability of these non-invasive methods, with the ability to detect an early therapeutic response or to provide staging and prediction of tissue fate, would greatly aid in patient management of both cancer and stroke...|$|R
