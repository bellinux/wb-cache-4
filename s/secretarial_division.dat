50|$|Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) is {{the angel}} {{who wrote the}} Word of God tablets. According to the demon tablet, he is an Archangel, but Metatron himself claims to be an angel from the <b>secretarial</b> <b>division</b> who was enlisted by God to write the tablets before he left Heaven. God later claims {{that there was no}} special reason He chose Metatron, that Metatron was just the closest angel to the door when He walked in. When God left and the Archangels decided to take over everything, Metatron left Heaven and hid on Earth, cutting himself off {{completely}} to protect himself and the tablets as he rightly assumed that the Archangels would need him to fulfil their plans. On Earth, Metatron lived among a Native American tribe known as The Two Rivers who he gave immortality in exchange for stories and books. Metatron became enamored by human stories and even though he read as much as an angel is capable of, he hasn't been able to read every story written during the past few millennia he has spent on Earth.|$|E
40|$|This study empirically {{investigated}} six {{values of}} (Information and Communication Technology) ICT applications which could wield {{an influence on}} {{the improvement of the}} government sector service quality in Sri Lanka. The independent variables were the transparency, efficiency, accountability, reliability, staff satisfaction and staff readiness associated with ICT applications. The research model is conceptualized taking into account the positive relationships among the six independent variables and the dependent variable of service quality. The study was conducted in 12 Divisional <b>Secretarial</b> <b>divisions</b> (DS divisions) randomly selected from the North Central Province (NCP) in Sri Lanka, with a sample of 196 respondents. The data were collected through a structured questionnaire. The result of the correlation analysis reveals that four variables of transparency, efficiency, staff satisfaction and staff readiness were significant and positively correlated with the service quality of government service. 46 percent of the total variation of the service quality of government service was explained by the research model. But further explorations are needed to deal with the other values of ICT applications relevant to the service quality in government sector...|$|R
