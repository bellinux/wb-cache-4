The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also held {{together}} by magnets. While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the <b>Smart</b> Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. <b>Smart</b> Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad (which wakes up when the cover is removed). There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive. <b>Smart</b> Covers are not compatible with the original iPad. In June 2012, Apple started selling the <b>Smart</b> Case - a case with the combined function of a <b>smart</b> cover and a back protection case which is compatible with the iPad 2, and iPad 3rd & 4th generation devices.|$|E

We showed that irradiation with 1 minimal <b>smarting</b> dose (MSD) of UVA immediately following tar removal lowered the MSD for 6 h, demonstrated by subsequent challenge with UVA. Following 3 MSDs this “memory” effect was demonstrable for 24 h. The <b>smarting</b> reaction was area dependent—smaller areas of exposure require higher doses of UVA to induce <b>smarting.</b> <b>Smarting</b> followed reciprocity over a 6 -fold range of irradiances (2 – 12. 5 mW/cm 2) but higher irradiances required higher doses of UVA, perhaps due to a delay in the recognition and reporting of <b>smarting.</b> The <b>smarting</b> reaction and delayed erythema due to UVA and tar were equally blocked by sunscreen...|$|R

5|$|During the 1740s, <b>Smart</b> {{published}} many poems while {{a student}} at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He eventually left the university in 1749 to devote his time to poetry. In 1750, <b>Smart</b> started to familiarise himself with Grub Street, London's writing district, and met John Newbery, a publisher. Soon after, Newbery began publishing Smart's works in various magazines and in collections, including Poems on Several Occasions (1752). Of these works, <b>Smart</b> {{was known for his}} Seatonian Prize-winning poems, his pastoral poem The Hop-Garden, and his mock epic The Hilliad. In 1752, <b>Smart</b> married Newbery's daughter, Anna Maria Carnan, and had two daughters with her by 1754. Although many of Smart's works were published between 1753 and 1755, he had little money to provide for his family. At the end of 1755, he finished a translation of the works of Horace, but even that provided little income. Having no other choices, <b>Smart</b> signed a 99-year-long contract in November 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled The Universal Visiter or Monthly Memorialist, and the strain of writing caused Smart's health to deteriorate.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, Christopher <b>Smart’s</b> work is {{presented}} as a coherent project of ‘Englishing’ to produce nationalised verse celebrating England and promoting the Anglican Church. Chapter One places <b>Smart’s</b> original religious poetry within the context of his translations. The analysis concentrates on three themes: the promotion of England in the Hymns and Spiritual Songs; <b>Smart’s</b> manipulation of verbal effects as a variety of translation in Jubilate Agno; and an interpretation of A Song to David as a form of applied praise. Chapter Two provides an analysis of <b>Smart’s</b> translation of the Psalms alongside a number of other similar productions. Five elements are examined: narrative identity in translation, the place of <b>Smart’s</b> psalms within an anglicised liturgy; Christian elements, censoring the Psalms; and the creation of English lyric through the domestication of biblical verse. Chapter Three examines <b>Smart’s</b> translation of the fables of Phaedrus, where the significance of <b>Smart’s</b> Englishing project is reinforced in the context of his interpreting a Romanised text. The genre of fable is considered in its eighteenth-century political and educational contexts, illustrated with detailed reference to <b>Smart’s</b> periodical fables from the 1750 s and the poet’s rewriting of Phaedrus in the following decade. Finally, Chapter Four provides a complete assessment of the 1767 Works of Horace. First, <b>Smart’s</b> translation is considered alongside other translations and interpretations of Horace and his work. <b>Smart’s</b> Englished text is then explored in three areas: the translator’s paratextual mediation between text and reader, the creation of anglicised settings, and the development of English lyrical forms from Latin originals. The thesis concludes with an examination of how <b>Smart’s</b> translation work results in the creation of original lyric verse that seals the poet’s literary permanence...|$|R
