TV Week described Chris as being [...] "deeply conflicted" [...] over his decision to tell her about his sexuality.

500|$|The gestational {{period is}} of {{seven to eight}} months, after which a single calf is born. A female about to give birth {{isolates}} herself from her group, and remains alone for some days afterward. The newborn calf weighs [...] Around 50% of the calves die within {{the first six months}} of birth, and only 25% can survive after three years. In a study at Basle Zoo (Switzerland), where 43% of the offspring from captive breeding died before reaching the age of six months, the major causes of high juvenile mortality were found to be the spread of white muscle disease and deficiency of vitamin E and selenium in diets. The herd size, sex, interbreeding, and season did not play any role in juvenile mortality. The mother hides her calf while <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to feed, and returns mainly in the evening to suckle her young. She checks the calf's identity by sniffing its rump or neck. In the first month, suckling may occur for eight minutes. The mother and calf communicate with low bleats. She licks her offspring, particularly in the perineal region, and may consume its excreta.|$|E

She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he will not be able to protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to get off this island more than anything. That makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|E

The couple, happy in poverty, are now rapidly drifting on the shoals of matrimonial disaster, but the child saves them. She is weeping one day when Miss Brent, the society woman, enters the room. Miss Brent, who has never seen the child before, asks the cause of her sorrow, and tries to comfort her. The child tells her, and Julia's heart is touched. Though she has contemptously ignored the wife, she feels that she cannot ruin {{the life of the}} helpless child, even to win the artist's love. On the spur of the moment, she writes a farewell note to Jack, and gives it to the child, saying that it will cure all her sorrow. Then <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> of their lives forever. Jack realizes, when he sees that his child is the messenger, why Julia has broken with him. An outsider had made a sacrifice to save the future of little Marie, when he, her father, who had always loved her, had selfishly forgotten his duty. Remorsefully, he tears up the letter, and destroys the painting, not angrily, but as a symbol that he had cast the original out of his life. Then he makes peace with his wife and daughter, who are joyfully ready to forgive, and tells them that their love will keep him [...] the right path {{for the rest of his}} life, and that the lesson he has been taught will never be forgotten." ...|$|E

When Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) sees Rainie, she reveals what Ian has done, but he is unable to tell Denise when he suffers a stroke. Ian meets Rainie to tell her that he will not pay her anymore, but Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) catches Ian and pulls up behind him. Ian drives away so Rainie approaches Mick, thinking he is a customer. He rejects her but the police arrest him for soliciting a prostitute. To protect Ian, Mick pleads guilty. Rainie and Cora meet at the court, as Cora has come to support Linda Carter (Kellie Bright). Cora confronts Rainie, and realises that she is the prostitute involved, and sees how low she has fallen and gives her money to fund her addiction so she can stop her prostitution.

2500|$|Miley {{has several}} reasons for {{creating}} Hannah. She is afraid that if the kids at school discover she is famous they won't treat her the same. While she enjoys the attention of her fame as Hannah, she equally enjoys the option of [...] "stepping out" [...] of her role. Miley also values her privacy and doesn't want fans or paparazzi photographers mobbing her when <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> in public. In this way, Hannah Montana presents a unique inversion of typical celebrity experiences. While most celebrities become famous as themselves and later need disguises to not be noticed in public, Hannah Montana became famous while in disguise, and now has the freedom to be in public as herself.|$|E

Wall likened Grace trying to complete a puzzle as <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to find clues that lead to the actual killer.

Wall said that Grace is true to form and behaves [...] "very aggressive", kidnaps him and tries to force Charlie to talk.|$|E
2500|$|In June, Raisman competed at the National Championships in St. Louis. She placed {{third in}} the {{all-around}} with a two-day combined score of 120.950, and finished first on beam (30.650) and floor (31.250). Károlyi said: [...] "She is just so solid. <b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> there and doesn't act like she's bothered by anything. She knows she's trained, she knows she's ready, and she doesn't put any extra pressure on herself. I really love {{to have this kind}} of gymnast. She gives her heart." [...] Sacramone added: [...] "I don't think she necessarily gets enough credit for how well she competes. At the last two world championships, I don't think she's made any mistakes. She's the backbone. If you want her to go and do something, do a solid routine, she's going to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Especially {{important}} in dating {{the text is}} Miss Gittipin's reference to Miss Filligree; [...] "theres Miss Filligree work <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> in her coaches & her footman & her maids & Stormonts & Balloon hats & a pair of Gloves every day & the sorrows of Werter & Robinsons & the Queen of Frances Puss colour." [...] Stormonts were a type of hat popular in the early 1780s but falling out of fashion by 1784. Balloon bonnets (linen cases stuffed with hair) had become extremely popular by late 1784, as had Robinson hats and gowns (named after the poet and actress Mary Robinson). The mention of Werter is also {{a reference to a}} hat, not the 1774 novel. The balloon bonnet and the Robinson hat were in vogue from late 1783 to late 1784, when they overlapped slightly with the increasing popularity of the Werter. By mid-1785, however, all three had fallen out of fashion. This serves to situate An Island in late 1783-late 1784, and taken in tandem with the topical references, seems to confirm a date of the latter half of 1784.|$|E
