Tintin's image {{has been used to}} sell a wide variety of products, from alarm clocks to underpants. Countless <b>separate</b> <b>items</b> related to the character have been available, with some becoming collectors' items in their own right.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the elder Joseph Terry's death in 1850, Terry's was {{becoming}} a household name due to its previous trade successes across the country. The younger Joseph, along with his two brothers, Robert and John, are credited with moving confectionery production to an industrial scale with the leasing of a factory at Clementhorpe, beside the River Ouse, in 1862. Its location was particularly advantageous, as the 22-year-old Terry had drawn inspiration from the manipulation of the railways initiated by his father, and saw the benefit of importing and exporting from the river using steamboats. Vessels from the River Humber supplied coal for the factory, while larger ships would import ingredients such as sugar and cocoa from around the world twice a week. The Clementhorpe factory also improved the logistics of the company, providing ample room for the construction of warehouses to store stock. Two years later, there were 400 <b>separate</b> <b>items</b> in the firm's price list, with around 13 of them consisting of chocolate as a main ingredient; others included various candied peels, cakes, biscuits and jams among other more exotic products such as cream balls.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{continuing}} to use the side-scrolling perspective introduced to the series by , A Link to the Past reverts to an overhead perspective {{similar to that of}} the original. While A Link to the Past still uses mechanics and concepts from the original game, it also introduces new elements and innovations. For instance, arrows are now <b>separate</b> <b>items,</b> as bombs are in the original, instead of using a Rupee to fire an arrow. A Link to the Past also takes concepts from The Adventure of Link, such as the magic meter, which is used by items such as the Lamp. Control of Link is more flexible than in previous games, as he can walk diagonally and can run with the aid of the Pegasus Boots (Pegasus Shoes in the GBA version),although he cannot use the Pegasus boots diagonally. Link's sword attack was improved to swing sideways instead of merely stabbing forward; this gives his sword a broader range and makes combat easier. Link swings his sword as the default attack in future Zelda games, although stabbing is also possible in the later 3D incarnations.|$|E

5|$|Like {{almost all}} amazons, the Puerto Rican amazon is a herbivore. Its diet {{consists}} of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar {{obtained from the}} forest's canopy. The species has been recorded to consume more than 60 different materials, although its diet was historically more varied due to its larger range. Among the items it consumes are the pericarp of the seeds of sierra palm (Prestoea montana), tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa), and negra lora (Matayba domingensis); the fruits of bejuco de rana (Marcgravia sintenisii), camasey (Miconia sintenisii), cupey de altura (Clusia gundlachii), and palo de cruz (Rheedia portoricensis); the flowers of bejuco de rana, achiotillo (Alchornea latifolia), and Piptocarpha tetrantha; the leaves and twigs of cupeillo (Clusia grisebachiana), laurel sabino (Magnolia splendens), caimitillo verde (Micropholis garciniaefolia), and Piptocarpha tetrantha; the bark of bejuco de rana, cupeillo, and cachimbo cumun (Psychotria berteriana); and the buds of cuaba (Inga vera). It normally selects the fruits positioned {{directly in front of}} its eyes, picking them one at a time with some rare exceptions. When feeding, it uses a foot to pick up the food. The amazon feeds in a slow, paused manner taking 8–60seconds to consume <b>separate</b> <b>items.</b>|$|E

25|$|From 1696 to 1700, {{only about}} 250 <b>separate</b> <b>items</b> were issued {{from the major}} {{printing}} presses in the American colonies. This is a small number compared to {{the output of the}} printers in London at the time. London printers published materials written by New England authors, so the body of American literature was larger than what was published in North America. However, printing was established in the American colonies before it was allowed in most of England. In England, restrictive laws had long confined printing to four locations, where the government could monitor what was published: London, York, Oxford, and Cambridge. Because of this, the colonies ventured into the modern world earlier than their provincial English counterparts.|$|E
500|$|The Laws of the Game set out {{the basic}} {{equipment}} which must be worn by all players in Law 4: The Players' Equipment. Five <b>separate</b> <b>items</b> are specified: shirt (also known as a jersey), shorts, socks (also known as stockings), footwear and shin pads. [...] Goalkeepers are allowed to wear tracksuit bottoms instead of shorts.|$|E

30|$|On {{the basis}} of the assumption, it is easily found which over- or under-challenging {{situations}} fit a set of items given to a participant, by a simple calculation. In concrete terms, which situations fit the given data are identifiable by comparing the sum of the squared deviations (total sum of squares (TSS)), calculated from all items to one from the <b>separated</b> <b>item</b> sets (self-focused and task-focused) for each situation, which is represented as a ratio between TSS of all items and one of the <b>separated</b> <b>item</b> sets. We found that the ratio in the over-challenging item set was higher than one in the under-challenging situation for all persons in the comparison.|$|R
500|$|In modern times, the {{familiar}} Western layout, as left-to-right linear Chinese, {{has become more}} popular. Similar to Latin-letter text, the horizontal rows are read from left to right, then {{top of the page}} to the bottom. This is used especially in the People's Republic of China (mainland China), where the government mandated left-to-right writing in 1955. [...] The government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) followed suit in 2004 for official documents. [...] The use of punctuation has also become more common, whether the text is written in columns or rows. [...] The punctuation marks are clearly influenced by their Western counterparts, although some marks are particular to Asian languages: for example, the double and single quotation marks (『 』 and 「 」); the hollow period dot (。), which is otherwise used just like an ordinary period full-stop; and a special kind of comma called an enumeration comma (、), which is used to <b>separate</b> <b>items</b> in a list, as opposed to clauses in a sentence.|$|E
500|$|Avatars {{of famous}} musicians {{are part of}} the game, {{performing}} for songs by that artist and available as unlockable characters. Notably, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana is a playable avatar; Activision had sought to gain permission to use Cobain's image for the game for three years, including obtaining the necessary agreements with Courtney Love, who controls Cobain's estate, and Dave Grohl and Universal Publishing, who control Nirvana's catalog. Cobain's avatar was designed with input from Love, who provided photos and videos for the design team to use, and emphasized how she would like Cobain to appear, starting from his appearance in [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] and modifying it from there. The avatar includes the T-shirt design based on Daniel Johnston's [...] "Frog" [...] that Cobain had popularized. Johnny Cash is also a playable character, with tribute artist Terry Lee Goffee helping to provide motion capture for his character. Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson (of Garbage), and Matthew Bellamy (of Muse) are also playable avatars, all of whom performed motion capture for their own avatars. There are also unlockable fictional characters like Skeleton, Golden God, Shadow, Frankenrocker, and Gerald Contest Winner. Though Activision approached Jon Bon Jovi to appear in the game, Bon Jovi turned down the offer. [...] While the standard character creator is available for all versions of the game, the Xbox 360 version allows players to import their Xbox Live Avatar into the game, while the Freestyle mode on the Wii version of the game allows use of the players' Miis in the game. Nine of the characters from previous installments return in this game. They all have a costume that they start with and 3 more can be unlocked by completing challenges. Doing this will unlock also new pieces of clothing for the costume to use for user generated rockers. Also, while Gibson no longer sponsors the game, other guitar manufacturers, like Ibanez, ESP, Paul Reed Smith and Schecter, lent the likenesses of their instruments, allowing for new combinations on assembling custom guitars and basses. For the first time, also, sponsored clothing pieces can be used in customization (these being shoes from Vans, Dr. Martens and Converse) There is no money in the game leaving everything available to use, including unlockables. Instruments can also be unlocked to use. Also some clothing now can be changed in style. There are four styles for each; the one shown, two others that were <b>separate</b> <b>items</b> in previous games (with exceptions), and one new one (with exceptions). Pregenerated characters outfits can only be changed and users can only decide which outfit they wear. However they can still edit their instruments. Virtual avatars of the real life rockers can also not be changed in any way, including instruments.|$|E

Overall, the vaccine was administered to over 440,000 children in 44 states, three Canadian provinces, and Helsinki, Finland, and the final report required the evaluation of 144,000,000 <b>separate</b> <b>items</b> of information. After the announcement, when asked whether the effectiveness of the vaccine could be improved, Salk said, [...] "Theoretically, the new 1955 vaccines and vaccination procedures may lead to 100 percent protection from paralysis of all those vaccinated." ...|$|E

On each saddle cloth, in similar positions, lay each man’s full equipment of about 25 <b>separate</b> <b>items,</b> all cleaned and polished up to the nines—saddles, stirrups and irons, bridles and bits, water bottles, feed bags, greatcoats, saddle bags, dixies, etc. etc." [...] On Friday 17 August, the Division moved back to El Fukhan. [...] "Six men on leave to Port Said." [...] The New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade arrived at Tel el Marakeb the next day for a fortnight on the beach before they returned to El Fukhari near Tel el Fara.|$|E
2500|$|Opinions among {{writers and}} editors differ {{on whether to}} use the serial comma. In American English, a {{majority}} of style guides mandate use of the serial comma, including APA style, The Chicago Manual of Style, The MLA Style Manual, Strunk and White's Elements of Style, and the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual. In contrast, the Associated Press Stylebook and the stylebook published by The Canadian Press for journalistic writing advise against it. It is used less often in British English, but a few British style guides require it, notably The Oxford Style Manual. According to The Oxford Companion to the English Language, [...] "Commas are used to <b>separate</b> <b>items</b> in a list or sequence … Usage varies as to {{the inclusion of a}} comma before and in the last item … This practice is controversial and is known as the serial comma or Oxford comma, because {{it is part of the}} house style of Oxford University Press." [...] Some use it only where necessary to avoid ambiguity, in contrast to such guides as Garner's Modern American Usage, which advocate its routine use to avoid ambiguity.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, after {{defeating}} an enemy, players {{must move}} to the corpse to retrieve any loot reward from it. [...] Because combat in Rohan {{is intended to be}} on horseback, and because it is incredibly inconvenient to swing the war-steed around just to loot a corpse, Riders of Rohan introduced the concept of Remote Looting. [...] Instead of having to travel back to a defeated enemy's corpse, loot rewards are automatically placed into the Remote Loot panel. [...] An alert is then displayed to the player which, when clicked, will open the Remote Loot panel. [...] This panel will hold a maximum of 50 items for 1 hour (in game time, not real time). [...] If any subsequent items are added before 1 hour has expired, the oldest items will be purged first. [...] If the player waits more than an hour, items that have been in Remote Loot for that hour will be purged. [...] Each item has its own timer. [...] Once the Remote Loot panel is opened, the player can opt to retrieve the loot or discard it. [...] Loot rewards discarded from the Remote Loot panel are irretrievable. [...] Players are not able to place items from their inventory back into Remote Loot. [...] Stacks of items will be placed into Remote Loot, but subsequent items of the same type will not stack with each other; they count as <b>separate</b> <b>items.</b> [...] For example, if a player is awarded 3 Athelas Potions, the whole stack of 3 will be placed into Remote Loot as 1 item. [...] If the player is later awarded 2 more Athelas Potions, the new stack of 2 will not stack onto the existing stack of 3. [...] The stack of 2 will occupy a separate item slot in Remote Loot, until the player retrieves the items. [...] The new looting rules were initially only implemented in Rohan, but due to positive player feedback were expanded {{to the rest of the}} game world in an update later that year.|$|E
