6000|$|... 247. I {{am sorry}} to find a notion current among artists, that they can, in some degree, imitate in a picture {{the effect of the}} stereoscope, by {{confusion}} of lines. There are indeed one or two artifices by which, as stated in the text, an appearance of retirement or projection may be obtained, so that they partly supply the place of the <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>effect,</b> but they do not imitate that effect. The principle of the human sight is simply this:--by means of our two eyes we literally see everything from two places at once; and, by calculated combination, in the brain, of the facts of form so seen, we arrive at conclusions respecting the distance and shape of the object, which we could not otherwise have reached. But it is just as vain to hope to paint at once the two views of the object as seen from these two places, though only {{an inch and a half}} distant from each other, as it would be if they were a mile and a half distant from each other. With the right eye you see one view of a given object, relieved against one part of the distance; with the left eye you see another view of it, relieved against another part of the distance. You may paint whichever of those views you please; you cannot paint both. Hold your finger upright, between you and this page of the book, about six inches from your eyes, and three from the book; shut the right eye, and hide the words [...] "inches from," [...] in the second line above this, with your finger; you will then see [...] "six" [...] on one side of it, and [...] "your," [...] on the other. Now shut the left eye and open the right without moving your finger, and you will see [...] "inches," [...] but not [...] "six." [...] You may paint the finger with [...] "inches" [...] beyond it, or with [...] "six" [...] beyond it, but not with both. And this principle holds for any object and any distance. You might just as well try to paint St. Paul's at once from both ends of London Bridge as to realize any <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>effect</b> in a picture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an automatic and robust approach to synthesize stereoscopic videos from ordinary monocular videos acquired by commodity video cameras. Instead of recovering the depth map, the proposed method synthesizes the binocular parallax in stereoscopic video {{directly from the}} motion parallax in monocular video. The synthesis is formulated as an optimization problem via introducing a cost function of the <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>effects,</b> the similarity, and the smoothness constraints. The optimization selects the most suitable frames in the input video for generating the stereoscopic video frames. With the optimized selection, convincing and smooth stereoscopic video can be synthesized even by simple constant-depth warping. No user interaction is required. We demonstrate the visually plausible results obtained given the input clips acquired by ordinary hand-held video camera. Index Terms — Stereoscopic video synthesis, parallax, optimization. I...|$|R

40|$|Interchanging {{the left}} and right eye views of a scene (pseudoscopic viewing) has been {{reported}} to produce vivid <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>effects</b> under certain conditions. In two separate field studies, we examined the experiences of 124 observers (76 in Study 1 and 48 in Study 2) while pseudoscopically viewing a distant natural outdoor scene. We found large individual differences in both the nature and the timing of their pseudoscopic experiences. While some observers failed to notice anything unusual about the pseudoscopic scene, most experienced multiple pseudoscopic phenomena, including apparent scene depth reversals, apparent object shape reversals, apparent size and flatness changes, apparent reversals of border ownership, and even complex illusory foreground surfaces. When multiple effects were experienced, patterns of cooccurrence suggested possible causal relationships between apparent scene depth reversals and several other pseudoscopic phenomena. The latency for experiencing pseudoscopic phenomena was found to correlate significantly with observer visual acuity, but not stereoacuity, in both studies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Stereoscopic videos {{have become}} very popular in recent years. Most of these videos are {{developed}} primarily for viewing on large screens located at some distance away from the viewer. If we watch these videos on a small screen located near to us, the depth range of the videos will be seriously reduced, which can significantly degrade the 3 D effects of these videos. To address this problem, we propose a linear depth mapping method to adjust the depth range of a stereoscopic video according to the viewing configuration, including pixel density and distance to the screen. Our method tries to minimize the distortion of stereoscopic image contents after depth mapping, by preserving the relationship of neighboring features and preventing line and plane bending. It also considers the depth and motion coherences. While depth coherence ensures smooth changes of the depth field across frames, motion coherence ensures smooth content changes across frames. Our experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method can improve the <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>effects</b> while maintaining the quality of the output videos...|$|R
40|$|High-quality {{stereoscopic}} image content must be viewable {{in a variety}} of visual environments, from 3 -D theaters to 3 -D mobile devices. <b>Stereoscopic</b> <b>effects,</b> however, are affected by screen size, viewing distance, and other parameters. In this study, the authors focus on the {{stereoscopic image}} quality experience of viewing 3 -D content on a mobile device in order to compare it with that of viewing 3 -D content on a large screen. The stereoscopic image quality experience was evaluated using Interpretation Based Quality (IBQ) methodology, which combines existing approaches to image quality evaluation, such as the paired comparison and interview, and assesses the viewer experience using both quantitative and qualitative data. Five stereoscopic images were used in the experiment. The results of the experiment suggest that the discomfort felt while viewing stereoscopic images on a 3 -D mobile device arise from not only visual fatigue but also the effects of the smaller screen size. The study also revealed the types of stereoscopic images that are suitable for viewing on 3 -D mobile devices...|$|R
