5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms and signs which {{vary depending on the}} individual and the duration of lead exposure. Symptoms are nonspecific and may be <b>subtle,</b> <b>and</b> someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms. Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur.|$|E
5|$|The film {{contains}} around fifty {{shots with}} computer-generated imagery. Alfredson {{wanted to make}} them very <b>subtle</b> <b>and</b> almost unnoticeable.

The crew used a combination of real cats, stuffed cats and computer-generated imagery.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{principal}} Upanishads {{can be associated with}} one of the schools of exegesis of the four Vedas (shakhas). Many Shakhas are said to have existed, of which only a few remain. The new Upanishads often have little relation to the Vedic corpus and have not been cited or commented upon by any great Vedanta philosopher: their language differs from that of the classic Upanishads, being less <b>subtle</b> <b>and</b> more formalized. As a result, they are not difficult to comprehend for the modern reader.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{fundamental}} group or the higher homotopy groups of a space, homology groups are important topological invariants. Although some (co)homology theories are computable using tools of linear algebra, many other important (co)homology theories, especially singular (co)homology, are not computable directly from their definition for nontrivial spaces. For singular (co)homology, the singular (co)chains and (co)cycles groups are often {{too big to}} handle directly. More <b>subtle</b> <b>and</b> indirect approaches become necessary. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is such an approach, giving partial information about the (co)homology groups of any space by relating it to the (co)homology groups of two of its subspaces and their intersection.|$|E
5|$|The hormones of the {{pituitary}} {{have different}} {{actions in the}} body, and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. The symptoms may be <b>subtle</b> <b>and</b> are often initially attributed to other causes. In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient. The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities. Growth hormone deficiency {{is more common in}} people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a large}} duck, and the male's long central tail {{feathers}} {{give rise}} to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running {{from the back of}} its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more <b>subtle</b> <b>and</b> subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female dabbling ducks. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century common {{concepts}} of what should be protected in national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading {{the federal government and the}} people of Florida that the <b>subtle</b> <b>and</b> constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|Many of Grant's {{associates}} {{were able}} to capture his confidence through flattery and brought their intrigues openly to his attention. One of these men, Orville E. Babcock, was a <b>subtle</b> <b>and</b> unscrupulous enemy of reformers, having served as Grant's personal secretary for seven years while living in the White House. Babcock, twice indicted, gained indirect control of whole departments of the government, planted suspicions of reformers in Grant's mind, plotted their downfall, and sought to replace them with men like himself. Grant allowed Babcock to be a stumbling block for reformers who might have saved the President from scandal. Grant's secretary of state, Hamilton Fish, who was often at odds with Babcock, made efforts to save Grant's reputation by advocating that reformers be appointed to or kept in public office. Grant also unwisely accepted gifts from wealthy donors that cast doubts on his reputability.|$|E
5|$|The Chronic is {{the debut}} studio album by American hip hop {{recording}} artist Dr. Dre. It {{was released on}} December 15, 1992, by his own record label Death Row Records and distributed by Interscope Records and Priority Records. Recording sessions for the album took place in June 1992 at Death Row Studios in Los Angeles and at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. The album is named after a slang term for high-grade cannabis, and its cover is a homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers. It was Dr. Dre's first solo album after he had departed from hip hop group N.W.A and its label Ruthless Records over a financial dispute. On The Chronic, he included both <b>subtle</b> <b>and</b> direct insults at Ruthless and its owner, former N.W.A member Eazy-E. Although a solo album, it features many appearances by Snoop Dogg, who used the album as a launch pad for his own solo career.|$|E

5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very <b>subtle,</b> <b>and</b> not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.|$|E
