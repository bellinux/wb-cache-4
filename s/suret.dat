5000|$|Huseynov {{is one of}} the co-founders of Azerbaijan Popular Front. With {{the arrival}} of Azerbaijan Popular Front in power in May 1992, Panah Huseynov was {{appointed}} the Secretary of State of Azerbaijan Republic. In early 1993, he became the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan but was removed in June 1993 following demands from the rebelling general <b>Suret</b> Huseynov (unrelated to Panah Huseynov) to sack Huseynov and dissolve the Cabinet of Ministers.

Huseynov and Javadov supported Aliyev in the 1993 presidential elections, and he was victorious. In the summer of 1993, <b>Suret</b> Huseynov's Ganja Brigade seized 10 villages from Armenians in the Karabakh zone. After this operation Huseynov was officially proclaimed a National Hero and appointed a Prime Minister of Azerbaijan. The same year Javadov was offered the medal of a national hero, {{but he refused to}} accept it until Azerbaijan fully restored its control over its historical territory Karabakh and the independence of the new Azerbaijan Republic was fully secure.|$|E

50|$|After the {{reorganization}} of the NKR Defense Army, the tide of Azeri advances was finally stopped. By September-December 1992 Azerbaijan's army was exhausted and suffered heavy losses. Faced with an imminent defeat, <b>Suret</b> Huseynov moved {{what was left of}} his army out of Aghdara and back to Ganja, where it could be recuperated and restocked by the 104th Guards Airborne Division of the Soviet Airborne Troops. However, after recuperating Huseynov did not march on Aghdara, but on Baku, intending to overthrow President Abulfez Elchibey in a military coup. In February 1993, direct evidence of treason by Azerbaijani Minister of Defense Rahim Gaziyev and <b>Suret</b> Huseynov was found in recorded conversation where Gaziyev was telling Huseynov about deliberate abandoning of Azerbaijani soldiers encircled in Hasanriz village by Armenians to their fate. By February 1993 the Armenians took back Aghdara. Later that year they regained not only their original positions, but also pushed forward to establish a security buffer zone around the former territory of NKAO, thus further expanding the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. However, the majority of Goranboy Region, captured by the Azeris {{in the early stages of}} the offensive, was not taken back by the Armenians. To this day it remains under the control of Azerbaijan.|$|E

50|$|On 13 June 1992, Azerbaijan {{launched}} its main offensive against {{the region of}} Goranboy, located north of Nagorno-Karabakh, which was defended by just two small and poorly-equipped Armenian voluntary detachments. This three-day offensive was code-named Operation Goranboy and commanded by <b>Suret</b> Huseynov. After fifteen hours of fierce fighting against Azerbaijani forces, the two Armenian detachments were forced to retreat. Azerbaijan managed to capture several dozen villages in the Goranboy region originally held by the Armenian forces, and the entire Armenian civilian population of this region fled. On 4 July 1992, the Azerbaijanis captured the largest town in the region, Mardakert.|$|E
50|$|Rovshan Javadov and <b>Suret</b> Husseynov {{publicly}} {{opposed the}} Bishkek deal {{and threatened to}} start military operations if Russian troops were to come to Azerbaijan as {{called for in the}} treaty. The political outrage caused by the potential return of Russian troops to Azerbaijan forced Heydar Aliev and Boris Yeltsin to amend that part of the treaty. In June 1994 Javadov announced his aim to run for the November 1995 parliamentary elections in which he would represent the opposition block to the authoritarian rule of Heydar Aliyev. In August 1994 he announced a plan to impeach Heydar Aliyev once he won the elections to the parliament.|$|E
50|$|After {{return of}} Heydar Aliyev to power as the President of Azerbaijan Republic, Guliyev was {{appointed}} to the post of Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan. Priority tasks assigned to Guliyev were implementing reforms in the agricultural sector and preventing further inflation. In May 1995, Guliyev was appointed the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan thus replacing <b>Suret</b> Huseynov and held the position until July 1996. Guliyev was also elected a Deputy to the National Assembly of Azerbaijan in November 1995. During his term, he participated in the UN project for declaring Sumgait a free economic zone and signed a contract with foreign oil companies for exploration, development and production at Karabakh oil field. In 1996 Fuad Guliyev left the position of Prime minister due to his poor health. He was replaced by Artur Rasizade.|$|E
50|$|Azerbaijan's {{military}} functioned in {{much the}} same manner; however, it was better organized during {{the first years of the}} war. The Azerbaijani government also carried out conscription and many Azerbaijanis enthusiastically enlisted for combat in the first months after the Soviet Union collapsed. Azerbaijan's National Army consisted of roughly 30,000 men, in addition to nearly 10,000 in its OMON paramilitary force and several thousand volunteers from the Popular Front. <b>Suret</b> Huseynov, a wealthy Azerbaijani, also improvised by creating his own military brigade, the 709th of the Azerbaijani Army and purchasing many weapons and vehicles from the 23rd Motor Rifle Division's arsenal. İsgandar Hamidov's bozqurt or Grey Wolves brigade also mobilized for action. The government of Azerbaijan also poured a great deal of money into hiring mercenaries from other countries through the revenue it was making from its oil field assets on and near the Caspian Sea.|$|E
50|$|The {{day after}} Mahir Javadov's {{statements}} {{he was invited}} by Chief Attorney Ali Omarov to {{the headquarters of the}} Attorney General's office to explain what had happened. At the Attorney General's office, a secret and an illegal attempt was made by presidential guards to arrest Javadov. Mahir Javadov resisted the arrest and with eight members of his security personnel from OPON quickly disarmed the forty-five presidential guards. Javadov arrested Omarov and others who were executing the illegal arrest warrant apparently issued by Aliyev. As soon as the news of the events spread, most of the National Army rebelled and OPON fighters seized most government buildings and openly challenged the authoritarian rule of Aliyev. Aliyev was forced to back down and blamed Prime Minister <b>Suret</b> Husseynov for causing chaos in the country. After two days of negotiations, Aliyev convinced Javadov that {{he had nothing to do}} with the arrest of the OPON members. To avoid civil war, Javadov agreed to peace and released all captured members of Aliev's militia.|$|E
5000|$|Lieutenant General Mammadov was {{deputy chief}} {{commander}} of Leningrad Military District {{before he was}} invited to lead the Ministry of Defense in Azerbaijan. On September 2, 1993 acting President Heydar Aliyev appointed Mammadov the Minister of Defense of Azerbaijan. He was appointed to the post at powerful colonel <b>Suret</b> Huseynov's request when Aliyev assumed power in June 1993, mainly because of his close ties to Russian military officials, including the Russian Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, in the hope that closer military ties with Russia would benefit Azerbaijan. However, the connections yielded the opposite. During his official visit to Russia in 1994, Mammadrafi Mammadov agreed to station two regiments of Russian armed forces in Azerbaijan which was announced by Grachev during the joint press conference. Since the motion was not previously communicated to and approved by President Aliyev, the claims were immediately refuted by outraged Aliyev himself. Within the next few months, Grachev as well as Anatoly Kornukov travelled to Azerbaijan to persuade Azerbaijani authorities to allow Russian military presence in Azerbaijan but were denied the requests.|$|E
50|$|The Azerbaijani thrust {{ground to}} a halt when the armor was driven off by {{helicopter}} gunships. It was claimed that many of the crew members of the armored units in the Azerbaijani Army launched assault were Russians from the 104th Guards Airborne Division, based out of Ganja and, ironically enough, so were the units that eventually stopped them. According to an Armenian government official, they were able to persuade Russian military units to bombard and effectively halt the advance within a few days. Russia also supplied arms to the Armenians. This allowed the Armenian government to make up its losses and reorganize a counteroffensive to restore the original lines of the front. Given the reorganization of the NKR Defense Army, the tide of Azerbaijani advances was finally stemmed. By the autumn of 1992, the Azerbaijani army was exhausted and had suffered heavy losses. Faced with imminent defeat, <b>Suret</b> Huseynov moved what was left of his army out of Aghdara and back to Ganja, where it could recuperate and restock on ammunition and armaments found at the 104th Guards Airborne Division's base. In February-March of the following year, the NKR Defense Army helped turn the tide into an unprecedented wave of advances.|$|E
50|$|On 13 June 1992, Azerbaijan {{launched}} the main large-scale three-day offensive against {{the region of}} Goranboy (the territory of the former Shahumyan rayon of Azerbaijan SSR) located north of Nagorno-Karabakh, which was defended by just two , small and poorly-equipped, Armenian voluntary detachments.

As many as 4 tank battalions and 2 mechanized infantry battalions of the 23rd Division of the former Soviet Union Army, as well as 4 additional battalions of the Azerbaijan Army and various brigades from the neighboring regions, were joined in this operation. After 15 hours of fierce fighting against the Azerbaijani forces, the two Armenian detachments withdrew. Azerbaijan managed to capture several dozen villages in the Goranboy region originally held by the Armenian forces, and the entire Armenian civilian population of this region fled. According to the report of the Memorial human rights society which sent its mission to Goranboy {{in the aftermath of the}} operation, there were no civilian casualties, as Armenians had fled the region before the Azerbaijani troops approached them. The population of the neighbouring Azeri and Russian villages remained unaffected.|$|E

40|$|In Nazım Hikmet’s poems, the {{critical}} attention is usually directed towards his ideological ideas and concerns. However, {{like every other}} poet, he also infused his poems with the magic of life and love. Nazım Hikmet is a universal folk poet who presented his devotion and passion for life and his admiration of nature in his poetry. In his poem called “Masalın Masalı”, he summarizes his life and the life adventure of humanity using {{only a limited number}} of words: “su, çınar, ben, <b>suret,</b> şavk, benim, bize, bana, güneş, kedi, ömür, sonra, sıcak, ulu, serin, şiir, başı, bir de. ” The tensions in the poem starting with the oppositions of water/sun and I/we, continuing with the opposition of adult/child, reach a conclusion with the oppositions of birth/death and being/nothingness. These tensions are presented in a certain order with a fairy tale style. The limited vocabulary used in the poem and the oppositions creating the tension are words and phrases connected to the whole of humanity and thus demonstrate the universal value of the poem...|$|E
30|$|Previous {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} that the order of training trials influences {{the efficiency of the}} training and the trainee’s ability to visually categorize trained and novel exemplars (e.g. Birnbaum, Kornell, Bjork, & Bjork, 2013; Carvalho & Goldstone, 2014, 2015; Kang & Pashler, 2012; Pashler & Mozer, 2013; Wahlheim, Dunlosky, & Jacoby, 2011; Zulkiply & Burt, 2013). A common finding in the literature is that individuals who are trained with an easy-to-hard schedule demonstrate better transfer than groups who are trained exclusively with hard trials or with a hard-to-easy schedule. The easy-to-hard effect has been demonstrated in a variety of species, including dogs (Pavlov, 1927), pigeons (Lawrence, 1952), and rats (Liu, Mercado, Church, & Orduna, 2008). Easy-to-hard training is also more efficient if the transition from easy to difficult items is gradual rather than abrupt (Lawrence, 1952). In humans, the easy-to-hard phenomenon has been shown in visual (Hornsby & Love, 2014; McLaren & <b>Suret,</b> 2000) and auditory (Church, Mercado, Wisniewski, & Liu, 2013; Liu et al., 2008) modalities. To account for the easy-to-hard effect, it has been hypothesized that the easy items provide good information about category structure, are easily encoded in memory, and serve as the foundation for learning more difficult items (Avrahami et al., 1997; Hornsby & Love, 2014).|$|E
40|$|Correction Notice: An erratum {{for this}} article was {{reported}} in Vol 36 (1) of Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes (see record 2010 - 02315 - 003). In the article “Learned predictiveness effects in humans: A function of learning, performance, or both?” by M. E. Le Pelley, M. B. <b>Suret,</b> and T. Beesley (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes, 35, 312 – 327), an incorrect equation was printed. The correct version of Equation 2 is: Δαp > 0 if |λ - Vp| |λ - VQ|. ] Many previous studies of animal and human learning indicate a processing advantage for cues previously experienced as good predictors of outcomes over those experienced as poorer predictors. Four studies of human associative learning investigated whether learned predictiveness acts {{at the level of}} learning (modulating the rate at which cue–outcome associations form), performance (modulating the strength of behavioral responses), or both. In Experiments 1 – 3, it was found that retrospectively altering the learned predictiveness of cues influenced responding to those cues, demonstrating that learned predictiveness influences performance. Experiment 4 indicates that learned predictiveness also influences learning by demonstrating that the learned predictiveness of a cue affects the acquisition of an association between a novel cue and the outcome with which it is paired...|$|E
30|$|Experiment 2 {{directly}} {{compares the}} performance and knowledge retention of groups trained using an easy-to-hard training schedule and a hard-to-easy training schedule. Categorizing lesions is a good test of the predictions of two types of scheduling procedures because it requires integration of information across multiple dimension (e.g. size, coloration, symmetry, and contour) (Ashby & Spiering, 2004; Spiering & Ashby, 2008). When categorization requires perceptual integration, some studies found a learning advantage for the easy-to-hard approach (Church et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2008; McLaren & <b>Suret,</b> 2000), while others report a learning advantage for the hard-to-easy approach (Spiering & Ashby, 2008). In the current experiment, all participants received {{the same number of}} easy, medium, and difficult training trials. Participants in the easy-to-hard group were trained with the easy items first, followed by the medium items and hard items. Participants in the hard-to-easy group learned items in the reverse order. Item difficulty was determined using the Ease values of the skin lesion images obtained in Experiment 1. Pre-training and post-training performance for the two schedules was tested immediately after training and two weeks later. The pre-training and post-training performance was correlated with the Ease value of individual test items. The two training conditions were compared by examining overall performance, as well as difficulty-specific performance, in the immediate and two-week post-test.|$|E
40|$|The Reverse TAC effect {{occurs when}} {{learning}} {{of a hard}} discrimination is facilitated by pre-training on an easier discrimination on the same dimension, even though the response assignments used in pre-training on that easy discrimination are reversed when shifting to the harder discrimination. The Reverse TAC effect has been demonstrated in both animal (Mackintosh and Little, 1970) and human experiments (McLaren and <b>Suret,</b> 2003). We consider two explanations for this effect; one is the associability-based hypothesis {{and the other is}} the strategic re-coding-based hypothesis. Associability theory gives an account based on a combination of associability processes and generalization. Associability is a learning rate parameter determined by the relative predictability of an outcome based on its relationship with the target stimulus. If the target stimulus is a relatively good predictor of the outcome (compared to other stimuli present), then this will tend to maintain, or increase associability. This then controls the rate of learning in a simple, associatively-based discrimination learning process. On the other hand, the strategic re-coding theory explains the Reverse TAC effect by appealing to a combination of the adoption of some cognitively derived strategy with simple discrimination learning and emphasizes the interaction between cognitive and associative processes. To assess these hypotheses, we carried out two experiments focusing on the effect of varying the amount of training. Our conclusion is that the strategic re-coding hypothesis is the less plausible account of the Reverse TAC effect. Instead, our empirical data suggested that if subjects ’ initial motivation was relatively low and they faced a situation where their performance deteriorated (through no fault of their own) {{over an extended period of}} time, then the associability of the to-be-discriminated stimuli would decrease, resulting in a deterioration in their performance...|$|E
