40|$|The Forward-Looking Interferometer (FLI) is an {{airborne}} sensor concept for detection and estimation of potential atmospheric hazards to aircraft. The FLI concept {{is based on}} high-resolution Infrared Fourier Transform Spectrometry technologies {{that have been developed}} for satellite remote sensing. The FLI is being evaluated for its potential to address multiple hazards, during all phases of flight, including clear air turbulence, volcanic ash, wake vortices, low <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> <b>visibility,</b> dry wind shear, and icing. In addition, the FLI is being evaluated for its potential to detect hazardous runway conditions during landing, such as wet or icy asphalt or concrete. The validation of model-based instrument and hazard simulation results is accomplished by comparing predicted performance against empirical data. In the mountain lee wave data collected in the previous FLI project, the data showed a damped, periodic mountain wave structure. The wave data itself will be of use in forecast and nowcast turbulence products such as the Graphical Turbulence Guidance and Graphical Turbulence Guidance Nowcast products. Determining how turbulence hazard estimates can be derived from FLI measurements will require further investigation...|$|E

To {{meet the needs of}} the commercial fleet, such a sensor should address multiple hazards to warrant the costs of development, certification, installation, training, and maintenance. The FLI concept is based on high-resolution Infrared Fourier Transform Spectrometry (FTS) technologies that have been developed for satellite remote sensing. These technologies have also been applied to the detection of aerosols and gases for other purposes. The FLI concept is being evaluated for its potential to address multiple hazards including clear air turbulence (CAT), volcanic ash, wake vortices, low <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> <b>visibility,</b> dry wind shear, and icing during all phases of flight (takeoff, cruise, and landing). The research accomplished in this second phase of the FLI project was in three major areas: further sensitivity studies to better understand the potential capabilities and requirements for an airborne FLI instrument, field measurements that were conducted in an effort to provide empirical demonstrations of radiometric hazard detection, and theoretical work to support the development of algorithms to determine the severity of detected hazard...|$|E

Previous sensitivity and characterization studies addressed the phenomenology that supports detection and mitigation by the FLI. Techniques for determining the range, and hence warning time, were demonstrated for several of the hazards, and a table of research instrument parameters was developed for investigating all of the hazards discussed above. This work supports the feasibility of detecting multiple hazards with an FLI multi-hazard airborne sensor, and for producing enhanced IR images in reduced visibility conditions; however, further research must be performed to develop a means to estimate the intensities of the hazards posed to an aircraft and to develop robust algorithms to relate sensor measurables to hazard levels. In addition, validation tests need to be performed with a prototype system...|$|E

Under high solar activity, the critical frequencies became higher, the reflection from the layer occurred {{closer to the}} radar, and the corresponding <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> decreased.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> distance measurement from aircrafts in conditions of complex spatial structure. The range determination in active laser <b>range</b> finders, including <b>slant</b> <b>range,</b> is based on measuring the time difference of two time points, the time point when the pulse exits the laser range finders, and the time point when the pulse comes back, after being reflected from a target. The signal emission reflected from a target is a variable of random process, because of the irradiated surface length, even under narrow field radiation. When determining the <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> distance from aircraft to a target, {{it is necessary to}} identify the signal emission reflected from a target, from background signal reflected by underlying surface. We propose two methods of <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> measurements, provided identification of target that is located on the underlying surface with complex structure. The first method is based on the measurement of <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> distance when the lower edge of the radiation field is aligned with the pointing direction. The second method is based on the measurement of <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> distance when the upper edge of the radiation field is aligned with the pointing direction. We propose structural schemes based on these methods and describe their operation principles. Evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages for each method is given...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a fast {{geometric}} rectification {{method for}} space-borne SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) digital image in <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> with no ground control point is introduced, {{which is based}} on the imaging principle of SAR and the law of geometric distortion in <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> image. The main idea is at first to resample a <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> SAR image to a ground range image with a definite ground spacing because the ground spacing corresponding to each pixel in slant is different caused by the different view angle. The coordinate system of the resampled image can be recognized as a plane rectangular coordinate system formed by the flight direction and the ground range direction. For the plain areas, the ground range image can be transformed into the image in a projected geographic coordinate system by four corner points whose ground coordinates can be calculated by the imaging equation. The rectified image is obtained with high accuracy; While for the areas with fluctuation topography, a higher precision rectification can be made based on the ground range image for it maintains the information of the original SAR <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> image(ground range and flight height) ...|$|R

At last, the processing errors and limitations of scene size in azimuth of the new algorithm are both analyzed.|$|R

This letter presents a new Chebyshev <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> function approximation that is shown to increase the accuracy of the analytical approximation of the bistatic point target spectrum. The performance of the new method is compared to the conventional Taylor series approximation approach in the generation of the point target spectrum. The new approach is shown to provide a more accurate approximation of the <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> function with negligible increase in processing requirements compared to the traditional Taylor series approximation. The accuracy improvement is shown to yield a more accurate spectrum that can be exploited in bistatic SAR focusing algorithms...|$|R

30|$|The diurnal {{minimum of}} the <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> in the E channel was seen near noon (see left column of Fig.  1 a). In {{the morning and}} evening, {{reflection}} from the layer occurred farther from the radar due to the lower critical frequency (see left column of Fig.  1 d) and the corresponding <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> increased accordingly. The minimum <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> in the F 2 channel showed a similar behavior in winter and equinox (see right column of Fig.  1 a). However, for the F 2 layer, decreases in the critical frequency were often accompanied by increases in the maximum height (and vice versa). Therefore, the <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> varied more rapidly in the F 2 channel than in the E channel. There were two local maximums in the diurnal dependence of <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> in summer. In addition to the nighttime maximum, there was a maximum near noon. The latter became most prominent under low solar activity. During the minimum of solar activity, the critical frequency of summer daytime F 2 layer decreased to the values corresponding to the E and F 1 layers. This {{can lead to a}} partial or total screening of the F 2 channel. In Fig.  1 a, the F 1 layer screens the F 2 channel at 13 LT in June 2010, and the E layer screens both the F 1 and F 2 channels at 12 LT in May 2010.|$|R
3000|$|Using {{elevation}} angles, {{we could}} significantly minimize the error. However, {{there was a}} shortcoming in that HF radar that cannot measure the <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> to the reflection point directly (in case of GB). In practical terms, one often assumes that the reflection point {{is located in the}} path middle point, and the <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> to the reflection point is equal to half of the full GB <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> (Bristow et al. 1994; He et al. 2004). This is correct for the spherical ionosphere. However, in general cases, the reflection point can significantly move out from the middle point due to ionospheric gradient along the propagation path. Figure  2 b shows a ratio between the full <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> and the <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> to the reflection point. The ratio is usually greater than two. Since beam # 0 is oriented towards the North, it usually has negative electron density gradients. The greatest gradients would appear at local times when the solar terminator passes through the propagation path. However, as shown in Fig.  2 b (right column), the ratio reaches values of ~ 2.3 even during daytime under low solar activity (the F 1 layer was lifted to the heights of the F 2 layer during this period). Figure  3 b illustrates a systematic error due to regular gradients. The offset is shown for the distance calculated by Eq. (5) using the elevation angle and r [...]...|$|R

A turbojet powered airplane was flown at altitudes ranging from 10 to 160 m over a 20 -microphone array positioned over grass and concrete.

In one method, a microphone close to the flight path is compared to down range microphones. In the other method, comparisons are made between two microphones which were equidistant from the flight path but positioned over the two surfaces.

Using a three-by-two repeated measures design, three groups of ten subjects each were tested at one of th~ee simulated sun angles(0, 90, and 180 degrees) and at two terrain tex-tures (hilly and flat).

30|$|In our analysis, we {{have used}} the GB echoes {{identified}} using the standard technique (Blanchard et al. 2009). We have excluded the echoes originating behind the radar by interferometer data analysis (Milan et al. 1997). The technique for identification of such echoes is similar to those described in Bland et al. (2014). For reliable identification of one-hop GB echoes, we have considered a number of criteria for the <b>slant</b> <b>range,</b> effective reflection height, and power for a certain beam, local time, and date. More specifically, we have developed a GB model (GBM) for each radar data (Oinats et al. 2016). GBM is based on HF propagation simulation {{in the framework of}} the waveguide approach (Oinats et al. 2012) and IRI- 2012 ionosphere (Bilitza et al. 2014). It includes a set of the following HF GB characteristics: the <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> corresponding to the skip distance, elevation angle, true height of reflection, <b>slant</b> <b>range,</b> and ground distance to the ionospheric reflection region. All the characteristics have been calculated for each radar beam for the entire period under consideration. Using the model, we have determined possible <b>slant</b> <b>ranges</b> and effective heights for each HF channel. This makes it possible to separate the regular GB reflected by E and F 2 ionospheric layers from other echoes. Since all the radar range gates satisfying the mask are determined at a certain local time, we searched for the range gate, that received the maximum power, and recorded the corresponding <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> and elevation angle values.|$|R
