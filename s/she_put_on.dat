Devine hit a four and a six from the last two balls of the 19th over bowled by Farrell to leave New Zealand requiring 14 runs from the last over, which Perry bowled.|$|E
25|$|Bembenek was {{diagnosed}} with post-traumatic stress disorder, complicated by a growing addiction to alcohol. As a form of therapy, Carson encouraged her to devote time to her passion of painting. Bembenek had made paintings since childhood, and her early work had {{been the subject of}} an exhibition at UW–Milwaukee in 1992. Carson constructed a studio for her, and she eagerly returned to her art. She had a fragile recovery, and after several years she had amassed about thirty paintings which <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> display at a local art gallery. This potentially transformative return to public life was wrecked when the gallery burned down in a freak fire and all the paintings were destroyed.|$|E

Poirot realised this {{when he had the}} man followed back to the lodge. Andersen's chemistry background (although he was probably not a Jewish refugee) came in useful for preparing injections of hashish to produce ecstasy in his adherents, and also for injecting them with relevant bacteria when he wanted to kill them and inherit their estates. Andersen was about to inject Miss Carnaby with tuberculosis bacteria to tie in with the fictional ailment she told him about. The proof has been obtained in the laboratory in the sanctuary that the police have raided.|$|E
25|$|She was {{the first}} woman to score both a test century and a One Day International century for the Kiwis. Her test hundred came against India in Dunedin in 1976-77 while her one-day {{international}} century came against the International XI in the 1982 World Cup, when <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> 180 with Lesley Murdoch.She also set the record for becoming the oldest woman to score her maiden ODI hundred in Women's ODI history(at the age of 39 years and 48 days) She scored 400 runs in Test match cricket at the excellent average of 44.44. In 16 One Day Internationals from 1973 to 1982 she scored 488 runs at 32.53. She also took 3 for 17 against Australia with her right arm medium pace, her only ODI wickets.|$|E
25|$|She {{could not}} perform La Dame aux Camélias on a London stage because of British {{censorship}} laws; instead, <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> four of her proven successes, including Hernani and Phédre, plus four new roles, including Adrienne Lecouvreur by Eugène Scribe and the drawing-room comedy Frou-frou by Meilhac-Halévy, {{both of which}} were highly successful on the London stage. In six of the eight plays in her repertoire, she died dramatically in the final act. When she returned to Paris from London, the Comédie Française asked her to come back, but she refused their offer, explaining that she was making far more money on her own. Instead, she took her new company and new plays on tour to Brussels and Copenhagen, and then on a tour of French provincial cities.|$|E

25|$|Early on 16 October, Marie Antoinette was {{declared}} {{guilty of the}} three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against {{the internal and external}} security of the State, and high treason because of her intelligence activities {{in the interest of the}} enemy; the latter charge alone was enough to condemn her to death. At worst, she and her lawyers had expected life imprisonment. In the hours left to her, she composed a letter to her sister-in-law, Madame Élisabeth, affirming her clear conscience, her Catholic faith, and her love and concern for her children. The letter did not reach Élisabeth. Preparing for her execution, she had to change clothes in front of her guards. <b>She</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a plain white dress, white being the color worn by widowed queens of France. Her hair was shorn, her hands bound painfully behind her back and she was put on a rope leash. Unlike her husband, who had been taken to his execution in a carriage (carrosse), she had to sit in an open cart (charrette) for the hour it took to convey her from the Conciergerie via the rue Saint-Honoré thoroughfare to reach the guillotine erected in the Place de la Révolution, (the present-day Place de la Concorde). She maintained her composure, despite the insults of the jeering crowd. A constitutional priest was assigned to her to hear her final confession. He sat by her in the cart, but she ignored him all the way to the scaffold.|$|E

500|$|William McGurk {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} Contemporary Psychology. Although McGurk praises the book's description of the est seminars, noting that it [...] "present {{a clear picture of}} the process", he also criticizes Fenwick's subsequent analysis, saying she [...] "sounds like a different person" [...] than in the first section. [...] McGurk writes that [...] "It's as though <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> her psychoanalytically oriented, professional hat and ran a tape that was far from being effective." [...] A review in Publishers Weekly states that Fenwick's [...] "inbred detachment may have kept her from the full impact of the 'experience' the training was meant to be (and is for many)". [...] Even so, the review notes that Fenwick [...] "scores heavily" [...] in the section where she questions the nature of the est training and Erhard's background; it recommends that Getting It be read alongside Luke Rhinehart's The Book of est.|$|E
500|$|Arriving in New York, Gauthier {{struggled}} to find a niche in an already crowded music scene. <b>She</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a performance in Vaudeville entitled Songmotion, which combined Javan music with dancers. New York was already home to many North American and European musical performers, so Gauthier focused on her Javan musical repertoire, which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing. Gauthier began giving annual recitals at Aeolian Hall, and in November 1917 her performance there {{caught the eye of}} many leading composers. She developed her own reputation quickly, known as a [...] "...sensitive purveyor of interesting, untried songs". She gave renditions of three songs by Maurice Ravel. [...] Her performance then also included American premieres of Stravinsky's Three Japanese Lyrics and Griffes' Five Poems of Ancient China and Japan. The performance was a great success, and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers. Stravinsky arranged to have Gauthier to premiere all of his vocal pieces.|$|E
500|$|Knowles {{commented on}} the song, [...] "It's energetic, {{aggressive}} and filled with hard beats". She explained that the album was completed in three weeks, which is the reason most of the record, including [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] sounds aggressive. She further clarified {{that she did not}} intend to write an angry song, [...] "Swizz's [...] had that tough vibe, like the guy had cheated, and I wanted to write something honest. If you're in a relationship, even if the man's cheating and you end up not wanting him, the thought of another woman benefiting from the lessons you taught him." [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] features Knowles as the female protagonist impersonating a threatened woman involved in a love triangle. She is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from all the efforts <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> to make her lover a better man. Frances Romero of Time magazine noted that Knowles' anger is due to her man's wandering eye, her desire to leave, and the thought of having to give him up to some unworthy woman.|$|E

Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone, manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a [...] "try this for a while" [...] experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, {{he had not been}} able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. [...] "When <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!'

500|$|Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{called the}} show [...] "possibly her flashiest, fastest moving, and most {{entertaining}} production yet", {{and added that}} the night belonged to Spears, as [...] "she managed to prove that she's still progressing as a showgirl. Not only that, she's doing it better than even diehard defenders would’ve predicted. At 29, the pop star whose career seemed in danger of ending just {{a couple years ago}} has shown that she's back– hopefully this time to stay." [...] Evelyn McDonnell of Spin said that [...] "the idol America loves to hate went all out. Her body perpetually moved, she sang steadfastly into her headset (okay, she's got plenty of digital support, but she doesn't merely lip-sync), and she shimmied through an endless parade of outfits. [...] Having been knocked down by the tabloid press and the public repeatedly in recent years, Spears is now desperately seeking our attention. And she earns it. Haters go home." [...] Kelley L. Carter of MTV commented that [...] "the Spears that captivated the audience at the Staples Center [...] was the old, fun-loving, free-wheeling Spears— with a sexy, showgirl twist. There wasn't much pretense, though those glamazon outfits blinded in the best way possible. Instead, there was just good dance music." [...] Carla Meyer of The Sacramento Bee stated that [...] "Though Spears performed like a pro throughout the show, hitting all her marks, she had shown hesitancy in her movements— natural for the first stop on a tour.

500|$|Nichols {{was cast}} as Shana [...] "Scarlett" [...] O'Hara in the live-action film {{adaptation}} of the G.I. Joe franchise [...] (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. [...] "I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then when I finally got to read it myself... I really, really liked it... I liked {{that there were two}} kick-ass female roles. And I liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised when I read the script." [...] <b>She</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> approximately [...] of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had [...] "an appealing manner and comely biceps" [...] as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her [...] "savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness." [...] After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played Anna Farrier.

Madonna is Madonna for a reason. And we saw it firsthand Sunday." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot called the show an [...] "S party to Ancient Egypt". Along with reminding the audience of her older hits, Madonna had [...] "important career-advancing work to do ... after all, never does anything unless she's got something to sell, and with a new studio album due out in March and a tour to follow, she had plenty on her to-do list". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that although the singer was not as [...] "indefatigable" [...] as she had been, she was a [...] "party girl turned regent: a queen on her throne, a homecoming queen strutting in the bleachers, a church singer fronting a choir". Pareles called Madonna [...] "grown-up", and wrote that <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a show appropriate for the NFL. Peter Robinson of The Guardian called the performance low-key for the singer, despite the large audience.
