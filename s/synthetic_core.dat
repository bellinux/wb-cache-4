40|$|In this Master thesis {{there was}} {{conducted}} polymer flooding of two-layered <b>synthetic</b> <b>cores,</b> {{where the two}} layers had different permeabilities, representing a stratified reservoir. The main purpose of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} crossflow within these layered porous media due to viscosity contrast of the injected fluids. It was tried to distinguish the separable effects of crossflow due to advection and diffusion. In particular it was desirable to find out if there was any significant diffusion of polymer between the two layers. A novel method was used to determine adsorption levels and inaccessible pore volumes within the layers of the cores. The polymer used for the core floodings was a synthetic polymer named Flopaam 5115 SH. In addition, a tracer was added to the polymer solution. This tracer was an elevated salt content within the injected brine, compared to the saturating brine, so that it could be easily detected by a resistivity apparatus. The polymer production curve was determined by a pressure transducer connected to a coil. To investigate polymer diffusion within the cores they were shut in for two days after being flooded with polymer, allowing time for diffusion to act. They were then flooded with polymer again for a second time. At the beginning of the second polymer flood it should have been possible to see a change in the response of the production curve, {{if there had been a}} significant diffusion of polymer between the two layers during the two days the core was shut in. Numerical simulations were also run with different sensitivities, in order to get a better understanding of what had happened during the laboratory core flooding experiments. The results showed that within the layered cores the high permeability layer was filled up with the injected fluid faster than the low permeability layer. Based on the numerical simulations and the experimental work it can be concluded that there were crossflow of the injected fluid from the high permeability layer to the low permeability layer. The crossflow between the layers of different permeabilities was mostly caused by viscous crossflow, both salt and polymer diffusion was negligible. Based on the sensitivity studies utilizing numerical simulation it seemed to be good fluid conductivity in the area between the two layers within the <b>synthetic</b> <b>cores.</b> Differences in adsorption time between the simulated and experimental cases is probably caused by the adsorption of polymer happening abruptly in the simulator, but during the flooding of the cores in the lab the polymer adsorption happened over time and were thus less concentrated at the flood front. A final concluding remark of this Master thesis is that doing experimental tests on <b>synthetic</b> two-layered <b>cores</b> can give interesting results for evaluation of polymer flooding. ...|$|R

Starting from aromatic heterocycles and focusing on a strategy of benzene annulation from heterocyclic-diene alkynyl-dienophile pairs forming tricyclic fused heterocycles were readily synthesized. The allowance of major product selection was demonstrated by solvent choice during heating; fully aromatic heterocycles were favored when PhNO 2 was chosen, {{in as little as}} 10 % by volume.

40|$|Formation {{damage of}} oil {{reservoirs}} {{as a result}} of fines migration is a major reason for productivity decline. Formation fines are defined as unconfined solid particles present in the pore spaces of formations. Their migration, caused by fluid flow in the reservoir, can cause pore plugging and permeability reduction. In the last 3 decades, many studies have characterized fines and their migration effect on permeability reduction. There are many techniques in the industry to remediate the damage, especially in the near-wellbore region. Nanofluids (NFs) that contain nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit specific properties, including a high tendency for adsorption and being good candidates for injection into the nearwellbore region, because of the small nanoparticle sizes. In this paper, a packed column is used to study the use of different types of NPs to reduce fines migration in synthetic porous materials. Three types of NPs [...] MgO, SiO 2, and Al 2 O 3 [...] are used here to investigate their effects on fines movement. The results indicate that fines may adhere to the matrix grains, hindering their migration, when the porous materials are soaked with NFs. Furthermore, to check the mechanisms of this remediation technique, the effect of nanoparticle concentration and fluid flow rates in the medium on fines detachment was studied. A theoretical model was used to calculate total energy of interaction for the surfaces to check experimental results, which was also validated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures for samples from <b>synthetic</b> <b>cores.</b> The results showed that addition of 0. 1 wt% of MgO and SiO 2 NPs reduced fines migration by 15 % compared with the reference state.

40|$|According to the macro-econometric literature, {{the impact}} of {{exogenous}} oil price shocks on Inflation have greatly increased {{in the last two}} decades throughout OECD countries while the persistence of those shocks on long-term inflation, namely core inflation, has dramatically decreased.

As the contribution of core inflation to the total headline inflation volatility bottomed, most of the volatility of headline inflation should thus be explained by changes in the spread between headline and core inflation indicators: a factor closely linked to commodity markets. This economic analysis should have important financial arbitrage implications in the futures market: are exogenous shocks on oil futures markets incorporated into zero coupon inflation indexed swap prices? To investigate this issue, we propose on the one hand a four-factor model for both inflation and nominal rates, and on the other hand a two-factor model for commodities.
