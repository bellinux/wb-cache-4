50|$|Geron Corporation was {{the first}} company to develop human {{embryonic}} stem cell lines in the mid-1990s. As the Champion of Telomerase Therapeutics at Geron, Villeponteau {{was interested in the}} status of telomerase in embryonic stem cells. As it turns out, embryonic stem cells have very high levels of telomerase. However, other aspects of embryonic stem cells were not ideal for human therapeutics (e.g. the formation of terotoma cancers), so many scientists and practitioners focused instead on adult stem cells, which do not typically generate tumors. In 2008, Villeponteau formulated a botanical mix that provided telomere support and boosted adult stem cell populations. Extensive work at Genescient showed definitively that the formulation can double maximum Drosophila life span under <b>specific</b> <b>stress</b> conditions In 2009 Villeponteau cofounded Centagen, which is a biotech company dedicated to developing stem cell technologies that can rejuvenate human adult stem cells from blood, bone marrow, or adipose tissue.

40|$|The {{use of a}} form {{of remote}} sensing {{to aid in the}} {{management}} of large turfgrass fields (e. g. golf courses) has been proposed. A turfgrass field of interest would be surveyed in sunlight by use of an airborne hyperspectral imaging system, then the raw observational data would be preprocessed into hyperspectral reflectance image data. These data would be further processed to identify turfgrass stresses, to determine the spatial distributions of those stresses, and to generate maps showing the spatial distributions. Until now, chemicals and water have often been applied, variously, (1) indiscriminately to an entire turfgrass field without regard to localization of <b>specific</b> <b>stresses</b> or (2) to visible and possibly localized signs of stress for example, browning, damage from traffic, or conspicuous growth of weeds. Indiscriminate application is uneconomical and environmentally unsound; the amounts of water and chemicals consumed could be insufficient in some areas and excessive in most areas, and excess chemicals can leak into the environment. In cases in which developing stresses do not show visible signs at first, it could be more economical and effective to take corrective action before visible signs appear. By enabling early identification of <b>specific</b> <b>stresses</b> and their locations, the proposed method would provide guidance for planning more effective, more economical, and more environmentally sound turfgrass-management practices, including application of chemicals and water, aeration, and mowing. The underlying concept of using hyperspectral imagery to generate stress maps as guides to efficient management of vegetation in large fields is not new; it has been applied in the growth of crops to be harvested. What is new here is the effort to develop an algorithm that processes hyperspectral reflectance data into spectral indices <b>specific</b> to <b>stresses</b> in turfgrass. The development effort has included a study in which small turfgrass plots that were, variously, healthy or subjected to a variety of controlled stresses were observed by use of a hand-held spectroradiometer. The spectroradiometer readings in the wavelength range from 350 to 1, 000 nm were processed to extract hyperspectral reflectance data, which, in turn, were analyzed to find correlations with the controlled stresses. Several indices were found to be correlated with drought stress and to be potentially useful for identifying drought stress before visible symptoms appear...|$|R

40|$|Small {{heat shock}} {{proteins}} (sHsps) have multiple cellular functions. However, the biological function of sHsps in pathogenic microorganisms is largely unknown. In {{the present study}} we identified and characterized the novel sHsp Hsp 21 of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Using a reverse genetics approach we demonstrate the importance of Hsp 21 for resistance of C. albicans to <b>specific</b> <b>stresses,</b> including thermal and oxidative stress. Furthermore, a hsp 21 ∆/∆ mutant was defective in invasive growth and formed significantly shorter filaments compared to the wild type under various filamentinducing conditions. Although adhesion to and invasion into human-derived endothelial and oral epithelial cells was unaltered, the hsp 21 ∆/∆ mutant exhibited a strongly reduced capacity to damage both cell lines. Furthermore, Hsp 21 was required for resisting killing by human neutrophils. Measurements of intracellular levels of stress protective molecules demonstrated that Hsp 21 is involved in both glycerol and glycogen regulation and {{plays a major role}} in trehalose homeostasis in response to elevated temperatures. Mutants defective in trehalose and, to a lesser extent, glycerol synthesis phenocopied HSP 21 deletion in terms of increased susceptibility to environmental stress, strongly impaired capacity to damage epithelial cells and increased sensitivity to the killing activities of human primary neutrophils. Via systematic analysis of the three main C. albicans stress-responsive kinases (Mkc 1, Cek 1, Hog 1) under a range of stressors, we demonstrate Hsp 21 -dependent phosphorylation of Cek 1 in response to elevated temperatures. Finally, the hsp 21 ∆/∆mutant displayed strongly attenuated virulence in two in vivo infection models. Taken together, Hsp 21 mediates adaptation to <b>specific</b> <b>stresses</b> via fine-tuning homeostasis of compatible solutes and activation of the Cek 1 pathway, and is crucial for multiple stages of C. albicans pathogenicity. Hsp 21 therefore represents the first reported example of a small heat shock protein functioning as a virulence factor in a eukaryotic pathogen...|$|R
