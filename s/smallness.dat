5|$|Journey is an indie {{video game}} {{developed}} by thatgamecompany {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. It was released on March 13, 2012, via the PlayStation Network. In Journey, the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other's names until after the game's credits. The only form of communication {{between the two is}} a musical chime. This chime also transforms dull, stiff pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The robed figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air. The developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of <b>smallness</b> and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player's actions, building a single theme to represent the game's emotional arc throughout the story.|$|E
25|$|The “New Faction”, despite of its <b>smallness,</b> {{significantly}} {{changed the}} situation in the Parliament. It truly said a totally different and new word in Georgia’s politics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Smallness</b> of CP violating phases: {{since no}} CP {{violation}} additional to that {{predicted by the}} standard model has been discovered so far, the additional terms in the MSSM Lagrangian must be, at least approximately, CP invariant, so that their CP violating phases are small.|$|E
25|$|The gas {{consists}} of very small particles known as molecules. This <b>smallness</b> of their size {{is such that}} the total volume of the individual gas molecules added up is negligible compared to {{the volume of the}} smallest open ball containing all the molecules. This is equivalent to stating that the average distance separating the gas particles is large compared to their size.|$|E
25|$|Regarding adjectives, Kannada had {{and still}} has a few native words that can be classed as true adjectives. Apart from these, {{mentioned}} in 'Numbers and natural adjectives', Kannada used and uses the genitive of nouns and verbal derivatives as adjectives. e.g. ಚಿಕ್ಕದ ಕೂಸು - Small baby (literally: baby of <b>smallness).</b> It may be {{said that there are}} not real 'adjectives' in Kannada, as these can be called moreover, nouns of quality.|$|E
25|$|And {{during the}} Car festivals {{and during the}} Ayya Vaikunda Avataram {{celebrations}} the worshippers {{are not allowed to}} draw water from Muthirikkinaru because of the uncomfortable situation because of the <b>smallness</b> of the well and the huge crowd. During those days one or two Panividaiyalars use to draw waters from the well and use to throw into the crowd, by which the whole crowd gets a few drops poured on their heads.|$|E
25|$|O’Neill was in {{permanent}} conflict with Portugal. While other contemporaries wrote poems that protested against national life under Salazar, O’Neill’s attack ran deeper. Poems such as ‘Standing at Fearful Attention’ and ‘Portugal’ {{suggested that the}} dictatorial regime was a symptom (the worst symptom) of graver ills– lack of courage and <b>smallness</b> of vision– woven into the nation’s psyche. Other poems, such as ‘Lament of the Man Who Misses Being Blind’, seemed to hold religion and mysticism responsible for an obscurantism that made change difficult if not impossible.|$|E
25|$|The journey, a {{distance}} of over a mile {{at a point where}} the tides run swiftly, was a dangerous one, and its reputation, the roughness of the water, and the <b>smallness</b> of the boats deterred travellers. Daniel Defoe visited the crossing from the Aust side in the 18th century, but did not trust the ferry to survive the bad weather, and elected to go via Gloucester instead. By that time, ferry crossings from New Passage, between Redwick near Pilning and Sudbrook on the Welsh side, rivalled the Aust passage, which became known as the Old Passage.|$|E
25|$|MPS I H-S, Hurler–Scheie {{syndrome}}, is {{less severe}} than Hurler syndrome alone. Symptoms generally begin between ages 3 and 8. Children may have moderate intellectual disability and learning difficulties. Skeletal and systemic irregularities include short stature, marked <b>smallness</b> in the jaws, progressive joint stiffness, compressed spinal cord, clouded corneas, hearing loss, heart disease, coarse facial features, and umbilical hernia. Respiratory problems, sleep apnea, {{and heart disease}} may develop in adolescence. Some persons with MPS I H-S need continuous positive airway pressure during sleep to ease breathing. Life expectancy is generally into the late teens or early twenties.|$|E
25|$|Nanavati spent 3 {{years in}} prison; it was feared that a pardon for him could elicit an angry {{reaction}} from the Sindhi community to which the Ahuja family belonged. At around this time, the government received an application for pardon from Bhai Pratap, a Sindhi trader {{who had been a}} participant in the Indian independence movement, and had been convicted for misusing an import licence. Given his freedom fighter background, and the relative <b>smallness</b> of his offence, the government was inclined to pardon Bhai Pratap. Finally, an application seeking pardon for Nanavati was obtained even from Mamie Ahuja, sister of the deceased. She gave her assent for his pardon in writing. Vijayalakshmi Pandit, then governor of Maharashtra, pardoned Bhai Pratap and Nanavati on the same day.|$|E
25|$|Diocesan bishops are {{required}} to appoint a judicial vicar to whom is delegated the bishop's ordinary power to judge cases (canon 1420 of the Code of Canon Law, canon 191 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches). In the Latin church, the judicial vicar may also be called officialis. The person holding this post must be a priest, have earned a doctorate in canon law (or at least a license), be at least thirty years old, and, unless the <b>smallness</b> of the diocese or {{the limited number of}} cases suggests otherwise, must not be the vicar general. As one of the jobs of the judicial vicar is to preside over collegiate tribunals, many dioceses have adjutant judicial vicars who can preside over collegiate tribunals in place of the judicial vicar and must have the same qualifications.|$|E
25|$|The One {{acts as the}} {{determining}} factor on the Indefinite Dyad, which is called 'the Great and the Small,' and eliminates its indeterminacy, which encompasses every possible relation between largeness and <b>smallness</b> or between excess and deficiency. Thus the One produces determinate relations between magnitudes by making the indeterminacy of the Indefinite Dyad determinate, and just these relations are understood by advocates of the unwritten doctrines to be the Forms of Numbers. This is the origin of determinate Twoness, which can from various perspectives {{be seen as the}} Form of Doubleness or the Form of Halfness. The other Forms of Numbers are derived in the same way out of the two fundamental principles. The structure of space is implicit in the Forms of Numbers: the dimensions of space somehow emerge from their relations. Key details of this extra-temporal emergence of space are missing from the surviving ancient testimonies, and its nature is debated in the scholarly literature.|$|E
25|$|A {{place of}} a number field F is an {{equivalence}} class of absolute values on F. Essentially, an absolute value is a notion to measure the size of elements f of F. Two such absolute values are considered equivalent if they give rise to the same notion of <b>smallness</b> (or proximity). In general, they fall into three regimes. Firstly (and mostly irrelevant), the trivial absolute value | |0, which takes the value 1 on all non-zero f in F. The second and third classes are Archimedean places and non-Archimedean (or ultrametric) places. The completion of F {{with respect to a}} place is given in both cases by taking Cauchy sequences in F and dividing out null sequences, that is, sequences (x'n)n ∈ N such that |x'n| tends to zero when n tends to infinity. This can be shown to be a field again, the so-called completion of F at the given place.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{of cooling}} {{has been shown to}} {{influence}} the frost resistance of tissues, but the actual rate of freezing will depend not only on the cooling rate, but also on the degree of supercooling and the properties of the tissue. Sakai (1979a) demonstrated ice segregation in shoot primordia of Alaskan white and black spruces when cooled slowly to 30nbsp&°C to -40nbsp&°C. These freeze-dehydrated buds survived immersion in liquid nitrogen when slowly rewarmed. Floral primordia responded similarly. Extraorgan freezing in the primordia accounts for the ability of the hardiest of the boreal conifers to survive winters in regions when air temperatures often fall to -50nbsp&°C or lower. The hardiness of the winter buds of such conifers is enhanced by the <b>smallness</b> of the buds, by the evolution of faster translocation of water, and an ability to tolerate intensive freeze dehydration. In boreal species of Picea and Pinus, the frost resistance of 1-year-old seedlings is on a par with mature plants, given similar states of dormancy.|$|E
25|$|By {{the date}} of the second marquee-auction of 126 more plots, the Land Company had built roads and was {{repairing}} the pier. Plots were advertised more energetically than before and promoted on the basis of Herne Bay's <b>smallness,</b> cheapness, ripeness for speculation and its proximity to the railway line. Sales were aimed at landlords wanting to buy cheaply and rent at profit, because at that time house-ownership was uncommon and tenancy was the norm. Prospective purchasers were promised trams and buses to take tenants to the railway station, or even an extra railway station close to the estate. The empty and rural nature of this spot was translated into promises of botanising, shooting, bathing, sailing and angling. Although no cheap train was provided on this occasion, plots sold at £8 to £32, making the Land Company £1,370. During 1889 sales were promoted by newspaper advertisements rather than auctions, and the pier's repairs were said to be ongoing. According to these advertisements there were croquet lawns and tennis courts plus a spring.|$|E
500|$|Cheetahs {{have a high}} {{concentration}} of nerve cells, arranged in a band in the centre of the eyes. This arrangement, called a [...] "visual streak", significantly enhances the sharpness of the vision. Among the felids, the visual streak is most concentrated and efficient in the cheetah. The nasal passages are short and large; the <b>smallness</b> of the canines helps to accommodate the large nostrils. The cheetah is unable to roar due to the presence of a sharp-edged vocal fold within the larynx.|$|E
500|$|He {{had a great}} {{influence}} {{on the development of}} Armenian music in the 20th century. [...] "Naturally, he immediately became an example for young national composers and a hero in Armenia," [...] suggests Maya Pritsker. Khachaturian's influence can be traced in nearly all trends of Armenian classical music traditions (symphonic and chamber), including on Arno Babajanian, a significant Armenian composer of the late Soviet period. His unique symphonic interpretation has influenced Edvard Mirzoyan, Konstantin Orbelyan and others. Khachaturian is credited for bringing Armenian music recognized worldwide. Poet Hamo Sahyan said about Khachaturian: [...] "He became the big denial of our myth of <b>smallness,</b> [...] became the symbol of measuring our small people with the great ones... became our certificate of civilization." ...|$|E
500|$|McCay {{married in}} 1891, and the {{marriage}} was not a happy one. [...] According to McCay biographer John Canemaker, McCay depicts marriage in Rarebit Fiend as [...] "a minefield of hypocrisy, jealousy, and misunderstanding". [...] McCay was a short man, barely five feet (...) tall. [...] He was dominated by his wife, who stood as tall as he was. [...] Images of small, shy men dominated by their taller or fatter wives appear frequently in Rarebit Fiend. [...] Gigantism, with characters overwhelmed by rapidly growing elements, was another recurring motif, perhaps as compensation on McCay's part {{for a sense of}} <b>smallness.</b> [...] McCay's brother Arthur had been put in a mental asylum, which may have inspired the themes of insanity that are common in the strip.|$|E
500|$|Religion and God are omnipresent {{throughout}} the collection, as evidenced {{from the first}} poem, [...] "Padamu Jua". Amir often uses the word [...] "Tuhan" [...] ("God"). However, unlike his earlier poems which used it {{in a similar manner}} to [...] "Dewa" [...] ("Deity"), in Nyanyi Sunyi the word is used as understood in Abrahamic religions, such as Amir's own Islam; Amir shows influences from Sufism. In some cases, writes Teeuw, Amir treats God almost as a lover, using familiar terms such as [...] "engkau" [...] ("you") to address Him. However, Amir recognises that he cannot be one with God. Jassin writes that Amir seems aware of his own <b>smallness</b> before God, acting as a puppet for God's will; Teeuw notes that Amir recognises that he would not exist if God did not.|$|E
500|$|Readings of Nyanyi Sunyi {{have tended}} to focus on {{religious}} undertones. According to Balfas, religion and God are omnipresent throughout the collection, beginning with its first poem [...] "Padamu Jua". In it, Jassin writes, Amir shows a feeling of dissatisfaction over his own lack of power and protests God's absoluteness, but seems aware of his own <b>smallness</b> before God, acting as a puppet for God's will. Teeuw summarises that Amir recognises that he would not exist if God did not. Jassin finds that the theme of religion is meant as an escape from the poet's worldly sorrows. Johns, however, suggests that ultimately Amir finds little solace in God, as he [...] "did not possess the transcendent faith which can make a great sacrifice, and resolutely accept the consequences"; instead, he seems to regret his choice to go to Sumatra and then revolts against God.|$|E
500|$|VanDerWerff {{said that}} Morrison had [...] "a nice {{moment when he}} underplays the scene where he talks about how Will once {{contemplated}} suicide after getting caught cheating on a test", though while Lynch thought the [...] "idea of the scene was nice", it was [...] "more awkward than meaningful". Slezak called it [...] "the worst moment of the episode", and criticized the [...] "utter lack of context" [...] regarding what else Will might have been going through. Kubicek described it as an [...] "embarrassingly uncomfortable speech", and Will's implicit comparison of cheating on a test to the stresses of teenage homosexuality was [...] "just wrong". VanDerWerff thought that the next part of the sequence had [...] "a <b>smallness,</b> a realness to the scene that's kind of beautiful, really", and that it feels [...] "like they're actual high school kids"; Votta commented that [...] "as the kids admit {{all the things they}} are looking forward to", it reminds viewers why they are [...] "rooting for this ragtag bunch".|$|E
500|$|In his 1961 article [...] "The Abstract Sublime", {{originally}} published in ARTnews, the art historian Robert Rosenblum drew comparisons between the Romantic landscape paintings of both Friedrich and Turner with the Abstract Expressionist paintings of Mark Rothko. Rosenblum specifically describes Friedrich's 1809 painting The Monk by the Sea, Turner's The Evening Star and Rothko's 1954 Light, Earth and Blue as revealing affinities of vision and feeling. According to Rosenblum, [...] "Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us {{on the threshold of}} those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite <b>smallness</b> of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detail—a bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscape—is no longer necessary; we ourselves are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures as if we were looking at a sunset or a moonlit night." ...|$|E
2500|$|Economic {{vulnerability}} (based on {{instability of}} agricultural production, instability of {{exports of goods}} and services, economic importance of non-traditional activities, merchandise export concentration, handicap of economic <b>smallness,</b> {{and the percentage of}} population displaced by natural disasters) ...|$|E
2500|$|Ruben Studdard {{emerged as}} the winner with Clay Aiken as a very close runner-up. [...] Out of 24 million votes recorded, Studdard {{finished}} just 134,000 votes ahead of Aiken, and the <b>smallness</b> of the margin of victory made this result highly controversial.|$|E
2500|$|Here [...] is an {{infinitely}} {{small amount}} of time and according to Newton, we can now ignore it because of its infinite <b>smallness.</b> He justified the use of [...] as a non-zero quantity by stating that fluxions were a consequence of movement by an object.|$|E
2500|$|In his Dictionary of London, Charles Dickens, Jr. {{commented on}} the <b>smallness</b> of the tunnel: [...] "there is not much head-room left, {{and it is not}} {{advisable}} for any but the very briefest of Her Majesty's lieges to attempt the passage in high-heeled boots, or with a hat to which he attaches any particular value." ...|$|E

When she was eight she traveled to Cuba, where she won two silver medals in vaulther first international awards. She practiced diving from the age of 12. She was nicknamed [...] "chiqui" [...] because of her <b>smallness.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Not every functor G : C → D admits a left adjoint. If C is a {{complete}} category, then the functors with left adjoints can be characterized by the adjoint functor theorem of Peter J.

2500|$|Steven Weinberg {{rejects the}} {{argument}} about the fine-tuning of the carbon cycle, arguing that [...] "the fine-tuning of the constants of nature here does not seem so fine". He acknowledges that he currently has no explanation (apart from a multiverse) for the <b>smallness</b> of the cosmological constant, but cautions that [...] "It is {{still too early to}} tell whether there is some fundamental principle that can explain why the cosmological constant must be this small." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, it was {{not clear}} how to do a {{continuation}} from [...] to [...] dimensions as the calculations relied on the <b>smallness</b> of the expansion parameter [...] The computational methods for a nonperturbative treatment were not at hand by this time. For this reason the idea of asymptotic safety in quantum gravity was put aside for some years. Only in the early 90s, aspects of [...] dimensional gravity have been revised in various works, but still not continuing the dimension to four.|$|E
2500|$|Thévenard had {{surrendered}} {{his ship}} without a shot being fired by either side. When taken on board Renard, her <b>smallness</b> surprised {{him and he}} requested {{to return to his}} ship to continue the fight. Coghlan naturally laughed at this request. Thévenard then asked that Coghlan award him a certificate stating that he had not acted in a cowardly manner. Coghlan replied [...] "No, I cannot do that; but I will give you one that shall specify you have acted 'prudently'!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing for Dawn News Mehar Khursheed wrote, [...] "A commendable {{quality in}} the novel was {{the way in which}} a child’s point of view is {{presented}} to the reader, as it takes one back to the insecurity that comes with the <b>smallness</b> of age and stature. For a debut novel, it is not too indecent an effort. However, English literature from Pakistan will always have a lot at stake as the audience and the expectation to deliver the culture, times and region one has set out to represent, responsibly and honestly, is twofold." ...|$|E
2500|$|From the Book of Isaiah , she {{was struck}} by another passage: [...] "you shall be carried at the breasts, and upon the knees they shall caress you. As one whom the mother caresseth, so will I comfort you." [...] She {{concluded}} that Jesus would carry her to the summit of sanctity. The <b>smallness</b> of Thérèse, her limits, became in this way grounds for joy, more than discouragement. It is only in Manuscript C of her autobiography that she gave to this discovery the name of little way, petite voie.|$|E
2500|$|In that series, Akilathirattu {{speaks of}} a well as, [...] "the {{eighteen}} castes assembling in one place, and bathing from the same well." [...] This refers to the prevalence of a seemingly innocuous practice of the people, gathered around Vaikundar, bathing together from the water of this well. People of different castes bathed together at this well, mindless of their social differences. Physical closeness was necessitated, {{mainly because of the}} <b>smallness</b> of the well. Besides bathing, they drank this water as cure for their illness. They cooked their food with the use of this water, and eat in community feast along with Vaikundar.|$|E
2500|$|In the Standard Model, leptonic family numbers (LF numbers) {{would be}} {{preserved}} if neutrinos were massless. [...] Since neutrino oscillations have been observed, neutrinos {{do have a}} tiny nonzero mass and conservation laws for LF numbers are therefore only approximate. This means the conservation laws are violated, although because of the <b>smallness</b> of the neutrino mass they still hold to a very large degree for interactions containing charged leptons. However, the (total) lepton number conservation law must still hold (under the Standard Model). Thus, {{it is possible to}} see rare muon decays such as µ → eγ or µN→eN: ...|$|E
2500|$|The finale vote {{had been}} {{controversial}} {{due to the}} <b>smallness</b> of the margin. Ryan Seacrest also added fuel by mistakenly announcing the difference in vote count first as 13,000, then 1,335, but eventually revealed later to be around 130,000. [...] There was much discussion in the communication industry about the phone system being overloaded, and that more than 150 million votes were dropped, making the voting results suspect. [...] In an interview {{prior to the start}} of the fifth season, executive producer Nigel Lythgoe revealed that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wild card week onward until the finale.|$|E
