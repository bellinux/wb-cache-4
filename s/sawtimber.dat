In the Southeast hispid cotton rat population density increases with {{the density of}} broomsedge (Andropogon virginicus) and other low growing plants, but declines with succession to brush and trees. In Texas pine-hardwood forests, hispid cotton rats were captured most often in narrow streamside management zones which have more light and thus more ground cover, and slightly less often in wider zones. In longleaf pine-slash pine stands of central Louisiana hispid cotton rats were captured in <b>sawtimber,</b> sapling, and regeneration stands but not in pole-sized timber; standswith surface cover {{were more likely to}} support hispid cotton rats. Pole-sized timber is dense, little light reaches the ground, and surface cover is minimal. In Louisiana and Mississippi, hispid cotton rats were more numerous in cut than in uncut bottomland hardwoods. They were also more numerous in cottonwood (Populus spp.) plantations than in uncut cottonwood stands. In northern Georgia intensive site preparation following clearcutting of pine-hardwood mixtures increases forage production and increased numbers of small mammals (presumably including hispid cotton rats).|$|E

In Washington, western tanager was observed on sites dominated by older (35-year- and 60-year-old) red alder (A. rubra), but not on sites containing young (4-year- and 10-year-old sites) red alder. Although western tanagers were fairly common on recently harvested sites, western tanagers were detected at the most points in [...] "mature" [...] and [...] "old-growth" [...] ponderosa pine in northern Idaho and western Montana. Western tanagers had higher densities in mature (33 feet, >10 m tall) conifer plots and young conifer/mature conifer transition plots than in young (3-33 feet, 1-10 m tall) conifer plots in British Columbia. Western tanagers occurred at an average density of 53.2 birds/100 ha in <b>sawtimber</b> Douglas-fir stands (>80-150 years old), 37.0/100 ha in mature Douglas-fir stands (>100 years old), and 3.1/100 ha in sapling Douglas-fir stands (<20 years old) in northern California. Although western tanagers occurred at higher densities in young Douglas-fir forest in Oregon, the stands were 40 to 72 years old. Mature forest was from 80 to 120 years old, and old-growth forest was 200 to 525 years old.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An intertemporal spatial {{equilibrium}} {{model of}} the eastern Oregon softwood log market was employed to es-timate the market and economic welfare impacts of restoration thinning programs established on national forests in the region. Programs treated only lands with <b>sawtimber</b> thinning volume and varied by the extent of public subsidies for costs, the types of costs that could be subsidized, and {{the form of the}} subsidy payment. Impacts on private harvest tim-ing, numbers of mills, and postprogram log prices in the region were found to vary markedly with the form of the pro-gram. Log consumers (lumber mills) consistently realized relatively large surplus gains, while private log producers' surplus showed smaller but consistent losses. For a comparable subsidy budget, programs that subsidized only hazard removal costs, on sites where net unsubsidized <b>sawtimber</b> returns promised to be less that these costs, led to a larger area treated than did programs with more flexible subsidy conditions. Across all programs, net agency receipts from <b>sawtimber</b> sales were estimated to be insufficient to cover the costs of all areas in need of thinning treatment (lands with and without <b>sawtimber</b> thinning volume).

40|$|North Mississippi has {{significant}} hardwood timber resources. Hardwood timber {{in the region}} has traditionally been {{an important source of}} raw material for furniture and other wood-based industries. In recent years, however, demand has greatly increased for hardwood timber for use in the pulp and paper industry, resulting in increased harvest levels of pole-sized and small sawtimber-sized hardwoods in the region. Increased harvests of hardwood timber have given rise to concerns about the longerterm availability of hardwoods that are large enough in size to be efficiently converted into lumber and other solid wood products. Futures options, futures contracts, leases, and limited partnerships were initially considered for potential application to increase the longer-term production of hardwood <b>sawtimber</b> on nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) lands in North Mississippi. Considering the resource, the NIPF ownership, and the timber markets involved, limited partnerships were chosen for further evaluation.

Four subsectors are included in the model: the forest owners, who supply <b>sawtimber,</b> pulpwood and forest fuels; the sawmills which demand sawtimber; the pulp and paper industry which demands pulpwood; and the energy industry which demands forest fuels. The results show that the short run elasticities are fairly consistent with earlier studies and that sluggish adjustment in the capital stock is important in determining the short and intermediate run responses. Simulation shows that an increase in the demand for forest fuels has a positive effect on the equilibrium price of all the three types of wood, and a negative effect on the equilibrium quantities of <b>sawtimber</b> and pulpwood.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Human-induced {{fragmentation}} of forests is increasing, yet {{the consequences of}} these landscape changes to vertebrate communities are poorly understood. Despite progress {{in our understanding of}} how bird communities respond to forest fragmentation caused by agricultural or urban development, we have little understanding of these dynamics in landscapes undergoing intensive forest management, where mature forest islands are separated by younger forest stands of varying ages. I developed a conceptual framework on vertebrate-habitat relationships in spatially complex landscapes and applied this landscape ecological perspective in the design and implementation of a field study on the relationship between landscape structure and breeding bird abundance patterns in the central Oregon Coast Range. I sampled 10 subbasins (250 - 300 ha) in each of 3 basins based on the proportion of subbasin in a large <b>sawtimber</b> condition and the spatial distribution pattern of that <b>sawtimber</b> within the subbasin. I systematically sampled each subbasin for birds during the breeding season and developed digital vegetation cover maps for each subbasin. I developed a spatial analysis program for quantifying landscape structure using the Arc/Info Geographic Information System. Using analysis of variance and regression procedures, I quantified the independent effects of habitat area and habitat pattern on several bird species, focussing on species associated with large <b>sawtimber.</b> Species varied dramatically in the strength and nature of the relationship between abundance and several gradients in habitat area and pattern at the subbasin scale. Relationships between bird abundance and landscape structure were generally weak; landscape structure typically explained less than one-third to one-half of the variation in each species' abundance among the 30 subbasins. Most species were positively associated with gradients in increasing landscape heterogeneity or {{fragmentation of}} their habitats; that is, they were associated with the more fragmented habitats.

Twenty-four 11 -acre plots were installed in well stocked stands representing north or east and south or west aspects. Stands between group openings were cut to residual basal areas of 65 and 85 ft 2 per acre using free thinning or structural control. Tree quality in residual stands was evaluated using U. S.

40|$|Abstract Providing {{economic}} incentives to landholders {{is an effective}} way of promoting sustainable forest management, conservation and restoration. In Hawaii, the main native hardwood species with commercial value is Acacia koa (koa), but lack of successful examples of koa plantation forestry hinders private investment. Financial models, which have been offered to encourage investment, assume that a particular minimum volume of merchantable wood will be harvested at rotation age. No {{studies have been done}} to determine the appropriateness of the assumed volumes for koa plantations. Three 18 - to 28 -year-old koa plantations were studied to determine butt-log size, crown class and crop tree potential. Estimates of present and future merchantable <b>sawtimber</b> volume were made for each plantation. Results indicate that most existing plantation koa trees fork so close to the ground that they will produce little to no merchantable wood. Projected <b>sawtimber</b> yields from crop trees in these plantations at age 45 years are 10, 15 and 90 m 3 /ha, which are below the 135 m 3 /ha yield used in the most recent financial analysis of returns on investment in koa forestry.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of forested landscapes is frequently required in civil engineering practice. In this study, some spatial analysis techniques are presented {{that might be}} employed with Landsat TM data to analyze forest structure characteristics. A case study is presented wherein fractal dimensions (FDs), along with a simple spatial autocorrelation technique (Moran’s I), were related to stand density parameters of the Oakmulgee National Forest located in the southeastern United States (Alabama). The results indicate that when smaller trees do not dominate the landscape (< 50 %), forested areas can be differentiated according to breast sizes and thus important flood plain characteristics such as ratio of obstructed area to total area can be estimated from remotely sensed data using the studied indices. This would facilitate the estimation of hydraulic roughness coefficients for computation of flood profiles needed for bridge design. FD and Moran’s I remained fairly constant around the values of 2. 7 and 0. 9 (resp.) for samples with either greater than 50 % saplings or less than 50 % <b>sawtimber</b> and with ranges of 2. 7 – 2. 9 and 0. 6 – 0. 9 as the saplings decreased or the <b>sawtimber</b> increased.

30|$|Similar to {{the results}} with the {{segmented}} taper model in Sabatia and Burkhart (2015), use of the best upper stem diameters in the polynomial model {{in the current study}} mainly improved the performance of the taper model in the upper half of the tree bole (Figs.  3 and 4). Consequently, volumes of tree boles that are longer than 50  % of the tree’s total height will be predicted more precisely by a DH+ taper model than they would be predicted by a DH model. On the other hand, tree boles that do not include, or only include a small part of, the stem portion above 50  % of total height are unlikely to be predicted differently by a DH+ taper model compared to how they would be predicted by a DH one. This explains the observation that the decrease in volume prediction error, due to use of the M 3 _HABH taper model, was largest for total aboveground volume and smallest for <b>sawtimber</b> volume (Table  4). <b>Sawtimber</b> top diameter limits were, on average, at a relative height of 60  % for trees in the split-validation data set and at a relative height of 67  % for those in the independent-validation data set.
