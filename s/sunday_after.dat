5|$|In 1724 {{the feast}} of the Visitation fell on the fourth <b>Sunday</b> <b>after</b> Trinity, thus the next cantata Bach {{composed}} was a chorale cantata for the fifth <b>Sunday</b> <b>after</b> Trinity. Bach did apparently not compose a cantata for the sixt <b>Sunday</b> <b>after</b> Trinity in 1724 while absent from Leipzig. Bach's second year in Leipzig passed without composing a chorale cantata specifically for the fourth <b>Sunday</b> <b>after</b> Trinity. He composed one for this occasion in 1732, Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV177, one of the later additions to the chorale cantata cycle. Also for TrinityVI Bach composed a chorale cantata at a later date (BWV9).|$|E
5|$|One unique {{feature of}} the ELCA {{calendar}} {{is that it has}} given congregations the options of two dates for the Transfiguration. Following most other Western Churches, the ELCA moved the Transfiguration from its August 6 date to the Last <b>Sunday</b> <b>after</b> Epiphany (the Sunday immediately preceding Ash Wednesday) as an option to the traditional Last <b>Sunday</b> <b>after</b> Epiphany in an effort to encourage a wider observance of the Transfiguration within congregations. However, the traditional date of August 6 was left on the calendar. Congregations were given the option of observing Transfiguration on the Last <b>Sunday</b> <b>after</b> the Epiphany and August 6, thus leaving open the possibility that the Transfiguration could be commemorated twice within a calendar year. In Sweden, Transfiguration Day is celebrated on the seventh <b>Sunday</b> <b>after</b> Trinity Sunday, which is the eighth <b>Sunday</b> <b>after</b> Pentecost.|$|E
5|$|When Alfred Dörffel listed Bach's chorale cantatas as a {{cycle in}} 1878 he ranged Meine Seel erhebt den Herren between the cantata for the sixt <b>Sunday</b> <b>after</b> Trinity (BWV9) {{and the one}} for the seventh <b>Sunday</b> <b>after</b> Trinity (BWV107).|$|E

5|$|Anarchist writer Bob Black, {{a former}} member, has criticized the Church, {{alleging that the}} group {{has come to be}} {{characterized}} by conformism and submission to authority.

5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata at a decisive {{turning point in}} his career. Moving from posts {{in the service of}} churches and courts to the town of Leipzig on the first <b>Sunday</b> <b>after</b> Trinity, 30 May 1723, he began the project of composing a new cantata for every occasion of the liturgical year.

5|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 12 August 1714.

He made revisions for that performance, such as transposing it from C minor to D minor and changing the obbligato viola to violoncello piccolo. In the same service, he also performed a new work, : one before and one after the sermon.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{followed}} a specific structure {{for most of}} the cantatas of his chorale cantata cycle, especially the 40 he presented consecutively from the first <b>Sunday</b> <b>after</b> Trinity of 1724 to Palm Sunday of 1725. In this chorale cantata format he retained the original text and melody of the chorale on which the cantata was based in the outer stanzas, typically treating the first as a chorale fantasia and the last as a four-part chorale setting, while the inner stanzas were reworded by a librettist as the basis for recitatives and arias, usually with music independent of the chorale tune.|$|E
