5|$|Functionalism, {{which began}} in the 1930s, relied on {{rational}} architecture making use of bricks, concrete, iron and glass, preferably to meet <b>social</b> <b>needs.</b> Its main proponents in Denmark were Frits Schlegel, Mogens Lassen, Vilhelm Lauritzen and, especially Arne Jacobsen with his Bellavista developments north of Copenhagen. Another of Jacobsen's masterpieces was the Aarhus City Hall which he designed together with Erik Møller in 1937 and completed in 1948. The tower is 60 meters tall and the tower clock face has a diameter of 7 meters. The building is made of concrete plated with marble from Porsgrunn in Norway.|$|E

He put great importance on law and citizen participation. These ideas he most equated to Rome and to the United States, a society which he viewed as exhibiting similar qualities. In order to civilize the Argentine society and make it equal to that of Rome or the United States, Sarmiento believed in eliminating the caudillos, or the larger landholdings and establishing multiple agricultural colonies run by European immigrants.|$|E
5|$|The {{state has}} a large, {{multimodal}} transportation system with the largest road network in the country. The state is well connected to its nine neighbouring states and almost all other parts of India through the national highways (NH). It boasts 42 national highways, with a total length of 4,942km (9.6% of the total NH length in India). The Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation was established in 1972 to provide economical, reliable, and comfortable transportation in the state with connecting services to adjoining states and boasts as being the only State Transport Corporation that runs in profit in the entire nation. All cities are connected to state highways, and all district headquarters are being connected with four lane roads which carry traffic between major centres within the state. One of them is Agra Lucknow Expressway, which is a 302km (188mi) controlled-access highway constructed by Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) to reduce vehicular traffic in previously congested roads. This expressway is country’s largest Greenfield Expressway which reduced the travel time between Lucknow and Agra from 6 hours to 3.30 hours. Other district roads and village roads provide villages accessibility to meet their <b>social</b> <b>needs</b> as also the means to transport agriculture produce from village to nearby markets. Major district roads provide a secondary function of linking between main roads and rural roads. Uttar Pradesh has the highest road density in India, (1,027km per 1000km2) and the largest surfaced urban-road network in the country (50,721km).|$|E

40|$|For the {{purposes}} of this study, <b>social</b> <b>need</b> is defined as need at an aggregate level, as expressed in statements of the form "Community X needs provision Y". The assessment of <b>social</b> <b>need</b> is of central importance in the determination of resource allocation, and "needs studies" are a major tool of social planners and researchers. Social indicators are also seen as being useful for determining <b>social</b> <b>need.</b> An examination of the literature relating to resource allocation reveals that there are some inadequacies in the way <b>social</b> <b>need</b> has been conceptualised, and that it has often been understood from within an essentially positivist perspective, as having some sort of independent existence and as being objectively measurable. Further conceptual exploration leads to an alternative formulation, where the emphasis is on the act of definition of <b>social</b> <b>need,</b> rather than on need per se. A model of <b>social</b> <b>need</b> statements is proposed, based on three different forms of need definition which are referred to as population defined need, care-taker defined need and inferred need. In any particular case of assessing the need for a specific service, or the needs of a particular community, there may be differences between these three forms of need definition. Several propositions are developed suggesting factors which may be significant in influencing judgements of <b>social</b> <b>need,</b> and which may lead to differences between population defined, caretaker defined and inferred need statements. These factors relate to the type of community, the type of provision or service, and the design and methodology of the needs study. An exploratory research study was designed to investigate these propositions about factors which may affect need judgements. Three different communities in southern Tasmania were selected, and the "needs" for four different forms of social provision were studied in each area. The overall "needs" of each community were also investigated. The research was undertaken in order to deter-mine a picture of population defined, caretaker defined and inferred need for each study area. Several different methodologies were used: a household survey, a survey of caretakers (service providers and opinion leaders), analysis of census data, analysis of service statistics and newspaper monitoring. The results of the research clarify the differences between the three forms of need statement. They indicate some of the factors which may be significant in contributing to these differences, and in affecting the way <b>social</b> <b>need</b> is defined. It is concluded that the proposed model of need statements represents a potentially useful framework for the study of <b>social</b> <b>need,</b> and {{on the basis of the}} research results the model is used to derive a number of suggestions for the design, assessment and analysis of needs studies. A frame-work for community development, based on the model, is also proposed, and further research questions arising from the study are identified...|$|R
