5|$|Tinne {{acquired}} a significant collection of clothes from shops in Bold Street, Liverpool shops and her local dressmaker. The collection comprised both off-the-rail items and bespoke outfits. She also made <b>some</b> <b>clothes,</b> including special outfits for her children's dance shows. The collection {{is held by}} National Museums Liverpool, donated in three stages by Emily Tinne's daughter, Alexine. Due to {{the sheer volume of}} items, Alexine would put out two tea chests per week, which would be collected by the museum. The collection includes more than 700 items, though many other items could not be accepted due to the low quality. The total collection included over 1000 items. The collection is the largest from an individual owned by a museum in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|On Day 98, one housemate {{was invited}} into the Diary Room. Camilla entered, and {{received}} a celebratory reception as she was informed she was the 1500th visitor to the Big Brother diary room. She was then told that she, and three friends in the house, would later that day dine with Big Brother. While the housemates had their meal with Big Brother, they were oblivious {{to the fact that}} one of each had a loved one in the house, leaving a gift for them. Max's mother cooked his favourite meal and left it simmering on the stove, David's mother left his saddle and boots for him in the bedroom, Camilla's friend left her <b>some</b> <b>clothes</b> and personal possessions, and Jamie's mother left him a clean pair of fisherman pants, a new headband and a much-needed belt.|$|E

According to Lieberman, she was {{planning}} {{to spend the day}} cleaning up the apartment in anticipation of a dinner visit by her cousin two nights later. She had a two-hour online chat with her mother, during which she mentioned that she was planning to check out the Windows on the World restaurant on top of the nearby North Tower of the World Trade Center, where a friend was to be married the next spring. At 4 p.m. she signed off and went to drop off <b>some</b> <b>clothes</b> at a neighborhood dry cleaners, then went to a Century 21 where she used the couple's American Express card to buy lingerie, a dress, pantyhose and bed linens. Afterwards she bought three pairs of shoes at an annex to the store.|$|E

500|$|Peter Hall {{directed}} the Bayreuth Ring after Chéreau. His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens {{in the simplest}} of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained [...] "The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – {{and as soon as}} someone appears they hastily throw on <b>some</b> <b>clothes</b> to protect their modesty." [...] While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.|$|E
500|$|Because {{there was}} no food for the {{passengers}} on the PT boats, Jean and MacArthur's aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Colonel Sidney L. Huff, packed tins of food into four duffel bags, one for each PT boat. Huff removed the four-star rank number plates from MacArthur's car {{so they could be}} used in Australia, and took a mattress for the MacArthurs to lie on. Stories later circulated that it was full of cash or gold. Other stories had it that furniture from MacArthur's residence in the Manila Hotel had been loaded on board the PT boats, even, in one version of the story, the piano. In fact, each passenger was limited to one piece of luggage weighing [...] or less. Jean took a small suitcase with <b>some</b> <b>clothes.</b> It sported a label from the Hotel New Grand in Yokohama, where she stayed during her honeymoon. Ah Cheu wrapped her possessions in a handkerchief. MacArthur took nothing.|$|E

500|$|As Mulder remembers it, {{that night}} he found Schaefer, in a dazed state, walking naked down a highway in Klass County. After getting him <b>some</b> <b>clothes,</b> Mulder takes Schaefer to a diner, where the pilot {{explains}} {{that he and his}} partner were dressed as aliens while flying a secret U.S. military vehicle designed to resemble a UFO. He thinks that he, his partner, and the two teenagers were abducted by real aliens in a real UFO, but Schaefer is also unsure if his surroundings are real or a hallucination, and he tells Mulder that he may not even exist himself, as he cannot be sure. His superiors soon come to take him away; before leaving the diner with the military officer, he tells Mulder that [...] "I'm a dead man." [...] The diner's cook, however, has a different version of the story. He tells Jose Chung that Mulder was in the diner by himself that night with no one else, and that he kept asking the cook strange questions about UFOs and alien abductions while ordering piece after piece of sweet potato pie.|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. cites guerrilla art {{and fashion}} as major influences. Her mother {{works as a}} {{seamstress}} in London. An early interest in fashion and textiles – designing confections of [...] "bright fluorescent fishnet fabrics" [...] — was a hallmark of her time at Central Saint Martins College. M.I.A. was a roommate of fashion designer Luella Bartley and is a long-time friend of designer Carri Mundane. Clothes from her limited-edition [...] "Okley Run" [...] line — Mexican and Afrika line jackets and leggings, Islamic-inspired and water melon-print hoodies, and tour-inspired designs – were sold in 2008 during New York fashion week. She commented, [...] "I wanted to tie all my work together. When I make an album, I make a number of artworks that go with it, and now I make <b>some</b> <b>clothes</b> that go with it too. So this Okley run was an extension of my Kala album and artwork." [...] Spin described her designs as [...] "1000 watt Malcolm McLaren-meets-Basquiat", that complimented her personal style that could [...] "run from futurist aerobic instructor to new wave pirate to queenly candy raver".|$|E
500|$|The next day, the {{newspaper}} has an item about Finn and Rachel, who were spotted on their stakeout. Quinn is furious with Finn, and Finn is already mad about seeing Quinn with Sam. They confront each other, then sing a barbed {{version of the}} duet [...] "I Don't Want to Know" [...] as their glee club assignment. Quinn then gives an ultimatum: if Finn wants their relationship to continue, he cannot sing any more duets with Rachel. Rachel has other ideas, and later sings [...] "Go Your Own Way" [...] to Finn, who accompanies her on the drums. Some sharp accusations are thrown before Sam bitterly reveals {{that he was at}} the motel because his parents are unemployed and his family lives there now that their house has been foreclosed on—Kurt was bringing Sam <b>some</b> <b>clothes,</b> and Quinn was helping Sam babysit his younger brother and sister. Sam storms out. When the club discovers from Quinn that Sam has pawned his guitar, they buy it back for him and offer their support.

500|$|The shows {{featured}} couture costumes {{designed by}} fashion house Ralph and Russo. Designer Tamara Ralph said Beyoncé {{asked them to}} be [...] "really creative" [...] while creating items with [...] "an ultra-glamorous feel to them". The duo's inspiration was [...] "modern showgirl", {{paying attention to the}} [...] "comfort and flexibility of each outfit and the ease of getting {{in and out of the}} pieces with quick costume changes". All the crystals for the show were provided by Swarovski; a team of 20 couturiers worked to complete the looks, which were embellished with more than 500,000 crystals from Swarovski Elements in four weeks. Beyoncé wore shoes by Stuart Weitzman. The dancers were dressed in Dolce & Gabbana and David Koma clothes. The band wore Alexander Vauthier clothes while The Mamas wore pin-up girl clothing. <b>Some</b> <b>clothes</b> for the show were also designed by Beyoncé's mother Tina Knowles. Beyoncé also worked with David Koma who designed a panelled bodysuit with lace detailing. Koma described his collaboration during an interview with Vogue, saying, [...] "I absolutely love to work with Beyoncé and her team and I'm very happy that she is back... She looks more beautiful than ever and it's always a pleasure to work with her!". Co-designer Michael Russo further described his collaboration with Beyoncé, [...] "Beyoncé always delivers energetic performances...

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, who had previously directed Rihanna videos for [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Drive". The video was shot in Venice, Los Angeles on April 3, 2008. The video begins with Rihanna {{standing in front of}} a black backdrop for the opening of the song. As the first verse starts, the scene is intercut with another of Rihanna looking out the window at her boyfriend and standing behind the front door as he approaches and asks to come in. As Rihanna walks way from the door singing the lyrics [...] "Don't tell me you're sorry cos you're not", the viewer realizes that her boyfriend has perhaps done something wrong and been unfaithful. During the first chorus and second verse, Rihanna is shown in a different outfit, this time sitting in a silver Porsche in a garage. As Rihanna pulls out of the garage and onto the street, her ex-boyfriend walks alongside the car as she drives and begs her to forgive him; she pulls away. For the bridge, Rihanna is shown sitting on a bed as well as in front of the black backdrops as she reads a text message from her ex-boyfriend, who asks to meet her. During the last chorus, Rihanna appears in a different outfit and walks into a lounge, where she puts <b>some</b> <b>clothes</b> on a table and then sits on a sofa. As her ex-boyfriend walks in, the singer gets up and walks over to the clothes, where she withdraws some matches and strikes one, dropping it on what is made aware to be some of her ex-boyfriend's clothes. As the song comes to and end, Rihanna walks out of the room whilst he tries to put out the fire.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of March 6, the {{collective}} began unloading several large, heavy boxes from a white station wagon and bringing them into the townhouse. [...] A few minutes before noon, {{an explosion in the}} townhouse basement tore the building apart. [...] Two more large explosions followed, collapsing the front of the building. The ruptured gas mains below the building caught fire, consuming part of the structure. Robbins and Oughton, presumably assembling a bomb in the basement, died in the blast. Gold was trapped under falling beams and died from asphyxiation. Boudin, taking a shower at the time, fled the building naked. Wilkerson, who was dressing, ran from the rubble clad only in jeans. [...] Anne Hoffman, wife of actor Dustin Hoffman and the Wilkerson's next-door-neighbor (the Hoffman apartment was partially damaged in the blast), grabbed a shower curtain and covered Boudin with it. Susan Wager, ex-wife of actor Henry Fonda, rushed up the street and helped the two women to her home. Wager gave them both <b>some</b> <b>clothes,</b> but the two women fled. Jacobs was not in the townhouse at the time, and went into hiding after the blast.|$|E
