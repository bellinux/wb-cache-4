Both the static and the active cameras are calibrated to a common reference, so that data coming from one of them can be easily projected onto the other, in order to coordinate the control of the active sensors. Another possible use of the master/slave approach consists of a static (master) camera extracting visual features of an object of interest, while the active (<b>slave)</b> <b>sensor</b> uses these features to detect the desired object without the need of any training data.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a cluster-based decentralized variational filtering algorithm with minimum resource allocation for simultaneous sensor localization and target tracking.

With the recent advancement in both electronics and wireless communication networks, implementing WSNs in practical applications has become feasible and can be expected. in the near future. However, current communications protocols are not suitable for use in WSNs due to the unique characteristics and the system constraints such as low power consumption, and low computational and hardware complexity. 'İn this thesis, we focus on the physical (PRY) layer design issues including. transmission medium selection, and transceiver design. Specifically, we first study a WSN architecture with a centralized topology. Motivated by the factor that if not properly treated, carrier frequency offset (CFO) and multipath channel can cause great degradation of data detection performance in conventional carrier-based radio systems (narrow-band and wide-band systems), we address CFO and channel estimation for multiple <b>slave</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes. Relying on a unique TDMA-like training head pattern, the joint multi-user CFO and channel estimation problem can be easily decoupled. Furthermore, the joint CFO and channel estimation for each <b>slave</b> <b>sensor</b> can also be treated separately without significant performance degradation. Different CFO and channel estimators are derived and compared. Optimal training design, specifically the pilot symbols placement, for burst transmission systems is also investigated, and an equal-preamble-postamble (EPP) placement scheme is shown to be optimal. In the second half of the thesis, the emerging ultra-wideband (UWB) radio technology is investigated in the context of WSNs. We believe that this new radio technology is a strong candidate for WSN applications d?e to its unique advantages. The modulation d receiver schemes are stqdied and block-coded modulation and a novel noncoherent receiver are proposed for impulse radio (IR) UWB systems. The critical challenge of timing synchronization for IR-UWB signals is also studied, and a new code-assisted synchronization scheme is proposed. This semi-analog based synchronization scheme enables the usage of both coherent and noncoherent receivers, and can be executed under either blind or data-aided mode.

40|$|Abstract—The prime {{motivation}} {{of our work}} is to balance the inherent trade-off between the resource consumption and {{the accuracy of the}} target tracking in wireless sensor networks. Toward this objective, the study goes through three phases. First, a cluster-based scheme is exploited. At every sampling instant, only one cluster of sensors that located in the proximity of the target is activated, whereas the other sensors are inactive. To activate the most appropriate cluster, we propose a nonmyopic rule, which is based on not only the target state prediction but also its future tendency. Second, the variational filtering algorithm is capable of precise tracking even in the highly nonlinear case. Furthermore, since the measurement incorporation and the approximation of the filtering distribution are jointly performed by variational calculus, an effective and lossless compression is achieved. The intercluster information exchange is thus reduced to one single Gaussian statistic, dramatically cutting down the resource consumption. Third, a binary proximity observation model is employed by the activated <b>slave</b> <b>sensors</b> to reduce the energy consumption and to minimize the intracluster communication. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of tracking accuracy, internode communication, and computation complexity...|$|R
40|$|The {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} is an emerging technology that may greatly aid humans by providing ubiquitous sensing, computing and communication capabilities, through which people can more closely interact with the environment wherever they go. To be context-aware, {{one of the central}} issues in sensor networks is location tracking, whose goal is to monitor the roaming path of a moving object. While similar to the location-update problem in PCS networks, this problem is more challenging in two senses: (1) there is neither a central control mechanism nor a backbone network in such an environment and (2) the wireless communication bandwidth is very limited. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol based on the mobile agent paradigm. Once a new object is detected, a mobile agent will be initiated to track the roaming path of the object. The agent is mobile since it will choose the sensor closest to the object to stay. The agent may invite some nearby <b>slave</b> <b>sensors</b> to cooperatively position the object and inhibit other irrelevant (i. e. farther) sensors from tracking the object. As a result, the communication and sensing overheads are greatly reduced. Our prototyping of the location-tracking mobile agent based on IEEE 802. 11 b NICs and our experimental experiences are also reported...|$|R

40|$|Smart {{parking is}} a typical IoT {{application}} that can benefit from advances in sensor, actuator and RFID technologies to provide many services to its users and parking owners of a smart city. This paper considers a smart parking infrastructure where sensors are laid down on the parking spots to detect car presence and RFID readers are embedded into parking gates to identify cars and help in the billing of the smart parking. Both types of devices are endowed with wired and wireless communication capabilities for reporting to a gateway where the situation recognition is performed. The sensor devices are tasked to play {{one of the three}} roles: (1) <b>slave</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes located on the parking spot to detect car presence/absence; (2) master nodes located at one of the edges of a parking lot to detect presence and collect the sensor readings from the slave nodes; and (3) repeater sensor nodes, also called “anchor” nodes, located strategically at specific locations in the parking lot to increase the coverage and connectivity of the wireless sensor network. While slave and master nodes are placed based on geographic constraints, the optimal placement of the relay/anchor sensor nodes in smart parking is an important parameter upon which the cost and efficiency of the parking system depends. We formulate the optimal placement of sensors in smart parking as an integer linear programming multi-objective problem optimizing the sensor network engineering efficiency in terms of coverage and lifetime maximization, as well as its economic gain {{in terms of the number}} of sensors deployed for a specific coverage and lifetime. We propose an exact solution to the node placement problem using single-step and two-step solutions implemented in the Mosel language based on the Xpress-MPsuite of libraries. Experimental results reveal the relative efficiency of the single-step compared to the two-step model on different performance parameters. These results are consolidated by simulation results, which reveal that our solution outperforms a random placement in terms of both energy consumption, delay and throughput achieved by a smart parking network...|$|E

Recognizing people’s physical activity has {{a broad range}} of applications. These include helping people maintaining their energy balance by developing health assessment and intervention tools, investigating the links between common diseases and levels of physical activity, and providing feedback to motivate individuals to exercise. In addition, fall detection has become a hot research topic due to the increasing population over 65 throughout the world, as well as the serious effects and problems caused by fall. In this work, the Sun SPOT wireless sensor system is used as the hardware platform to recognize physical activity and detect fall. The sensors with tri-axis accelerometers are used to collect acceleration data, which are further processed and extracted with useful information. The evaluation results from various algorithms indicate that Naive Bayes algorithm works better than other popular algorithms both in accuracy and implementation in this particular application. This wearable system works in two modes: indoor and outdoor, depending on user’s demand. Naive Bayes classifier is successfully implemented in the Sun SPOT sensor. The results of evaluating sampling rate denote that 20 Hz is an optimal sampling frequency in this application. If only one sensor is available to recognize physical activity, the best location is attaching it to the thigh. If two sensors are available, the combination at the left thigh and the right thigh is the best option, 90. 52 % overall accuracy in the experiment.

Reef aquarists aim to replicate these marine ecosystems within aquariums in their homes, for the aesthetic beauty of such coral reef tanks.

The project, that this thesis is based on, involves {{the development of a}} control and monitoring system for a marine ecosystem sustained within an aquarium. The aim for the system was to control and monitor water parameters not yet considered by existing systems, in turn improving the stability of the ecosystem and reducing maintenance of the aquarium.

The 1 -wire bus system provides the sufficient control and operation signal, a unique ID serial number of each sensor and it supports multiple temperature sensors by a driving power (Parasite Power) on single line. On the 1 -Wire bus system, temperature sensors are supplied by two types of power supplies, external Power supply and Parasitic Power. The aim of this project is to program the microprocessor (Arduino) by using Arduino programming language to work as a temperature sensor type DS 18 B 20 and also as a slave on the 1 -Wire bus system. This report explains the 1 -Wire bus system techniques and how the communication is achieved between the master and the <b>slave</b> (<b>sensors)</b> to measure the temperature values. The measured temperature values are collected from the output of each active sensor on the 1 -Wire bus. These data are displayed by the personal computer (PC) which is worked as a master on the 1 -Wire bus, and the data are represent the measured temperature values from twelve active sensors on the bus system. In this thesis, the temperature values from the 12 active sensors can be read and displayed on the master (PC) by using the following programs: Open Logger One Wire (OLOW) program, One Wire Viewer, DigiTemp and OWFS and I validated all the temperature values from these active sensors which are read and monitored by the drive bus programs. The comparison is done among the measured temperature values to see if the active sensors are given accurate temperature values with different drive bus programs. The project shows that the sensors can be connected in a network with the master, by using 1 -Wire bus techniques.

30|$|The {{suggested}} BodyQoS protocol comprises of an Admission Control, QoS scheduler and Virtual MAC (VMAC) [61]. The functionalities {{of admission}} control and QoS scheduler are implemented on the master node (aggregator) and <b>slave</b> nodes (<b>sensors).</b> The admission control and scheduler for a master node are {{handled by the}} aggregator. For a slave node, the admission and scheduler are handled by sensor nodes. The benefits of admission control are: (i) the node transmits the request for new QoS channel reservation which can be accepted or rejected. The acceptance or rejection {{is based on the}} availability of bandwidth, (ii) polling of individual sensor to access channel, and (iii) measures the criticality level of a patient’s data. In the QoS scheduler, there are three types of traffic considered that are aggregator to a sensor, Sensor to the aggregator and best effort delivery. The VMAC is used to connect the transport layer with MAC layer. The suggested protocol [61] consumes a higher amount of energy of sensors because most of the activities are performed on sensors. Another limitation of this protocol is that each sensor waits for verifying the availability of slots to transmit data which reduces the performance of the suggested MAC in terms of collision with a higher delay.|$|R

40|$|SAR Interferometry (InSAR) {{is a well}} {{established}} remote sensing technique widely employed for the retrieval of topographic information. The relative vertical accuracy of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generated through InSAR techniques depends, among other factors, on the spatial separation between master and <b>slave</b> <b>sensors</b> and on the signal correlation between both datasets. In monostatic single-pass configurations, master and slave data are acquired simultaneously by sensors mounted on the same platform. As a consequence, the single-pass interferogram does not present temporal decorrelation and is less affected by spatially correlated artifacts. However, the fixed baseline limits the achievable relative vertical accuracy. On the other hand, repeat-pass configurations offer a flexible choice of baseline enabling the retrieval of very fine elevation measurements, provided that the temporal decorrelation can be kept small. Nevertheless, since the datasets are acquired independently, the interferograms are subject to artifacts due to, e. g., aircraft motion or propagation in the inhomogeneous atmosphere. Hence, the extraction of precise terrain information from repeat-pass data requires an accurate phase calibration, i. e., the removal of all undesired phase biases. In this thesis, the joint use of single- and repeat-pass datasets in a multi-mode configuration is proposed in order {{to profit from the}} stability of the single-pass derived DEMs in relation to spatially correlated artifacts, {{as well as from the}} robustness to noise associated with large baseline acquisitions. As the large-baseline interferometric phase is highly sensitive to the unknown topography and to systems errors and other artifacts, large phase variations between neighboring pixels are observed. The former in association with elevated noise can compromise the phase unwrapping, thus preventing the retrieval of accurate height measurements. In order to overcome this limitation and to promote a robust phase calibration, the use of data simultaneously acquired with an additional carrier frequency is proposed. Hence, the final DEM is extracted from a Dual-Frequency and Dual-Baseline (DFDB) dataset with the help of new algorithms developed for the proposed configuration. Specifically, a method for the mitigation of artifacts in the single-pass data due to multiple reflections in the aircraft is suggested. Furthermore, a dual-channel region-growing algorithm is proposed for efficient phase unwrapping. An active-contour-based unwrapping error correction strategy is developed for the treatment of residual errors associated with challenging terrain characteristics. A DFDB framework is proposed for the calibration of residual constant and linear baseline errors and global phase offsets, including alternatives in the complex domain and considering the use of external reference data. Finally, the joint estimation of the underlying topographic information is discussed and the problem of the correction of spatially correlated artifacts in the repeat-pass data and noise reduction are tackled. All developed algorithms are validated with DFDB data acquired with the F-SAR sensor during two campaigns in Germany: the first over tidal flats in the Jade Bight, North Sea; and the second over a calibration test-site in Kaufbeuren. In both cases, the proposed methodology allows the generation of elevation models with relative and absolute vertical accuracies in the order of centimeters. Lastly, the developed phase unwrapping framework is applied to TanDEM-X large-baseline data, demonstrating the use of the algorithm for single-pass spaceborne datasets with multiple acquisitions...|$|R

It is provided with smart sensors equipped with signal conversion electronics, individual identification and communication means decreasing {{the complexity of the}} measurement system and also the measurement errors that can appear during analog signal transmission along the cables from the sensors to the measuring unit. The applied wireless communication system operates in the 433 MHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific, Medical) licence free frequency band for transmission of commands and data between a remote PC compatible computer (Master unit) and the smart <b>sensors</b> (<b>Slave</b> units) in the distance of several hundred meters.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an operational concept and {{the implementation of}} an automated process chain for the characterisation of hyperspectral sensors. The process chain includes the definition of sensor independent measurement procedures, the conduction of the measurements and {{the analysis of the}} recorded data to determine sensor parameters. The design driver for the setup of the Calibration Home Base (CHB) was the imaging spectrometer APEX (Airborne Prism EXperiment). But the facility can also be used for the characterisation of other optical sensors like the DLR sensors ROSIS (Reflective Optics System Imaging Spectrometer), ARES (Airborne Reflective Emissive Spectrometer) and AISA (Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for different Applications). The first part of this thesis describes the setup of the laboratory and its devices (chapter 2) as well as the operational concept for the automatic conduction of characterisation measurements (chapter 3). The concept divides the measurement process into three functional modules: a generic measurement control module (Master), a module for the control of the laboratory devices (<b>Slave)</b> and a <b>sensor</b> specific control module (Sensor) per sensor. The single modules interact via TCP/IP on the intranet by exchanging commands using well-defined XML formatted data. The implementation of the concept is described in Chapter 4. Utilising the new Slave software the laboratory can be operated fully automated. The operator in the laboratory does not need a broad knowledge of the operation of the individual devices. The necessary manual settings are interactively reported to the operator by the Slave module. Furthermore the Slave module monitors a multitude of possible errors of the single laboratory devices. In addition the Slave enables external users to use the laboratory needing nothing more than the description of the interface. The Master software is the central superordinate module which controls the Slave and the respective Sensor module. The Master hosts the various characterisation measurement procedures and executes the detailed instructions of the actual procedure(s). The Master offers many different options for the execution of measurements. For example, it is possible to use the emulate mode, or to control only the laboratory devices or the sensor, or to transfer data, or to carry out a data analysis. A time estimation function enables the evaluation of the estimated time for the execution of a measurement series. The Master module has comprehensive monitoring functions to ensure a safe operation of the laboratory, to intercept arising errors, to interrupt the measurement process and to inform the operator immediately. Besides the monitoring functions, the Master stores the actual device settings in measurement logs which are necessary for the analysis software. The current measurement process can be monitored using an internal web site. The operator has to access the laboratory only in case of a necessary manual interaction. This is beneficial for working safety aspects (dark room) and cost reasons. Each sensor needs its individual Sensor module for the communication with the Master module, due to different internal devices which have to be controlled (sensor mirrors, internal calibration devices, shutter, etc.). The sensor control software has to provide an input interface for the communication with the Sensor module. If this is missing the sensor control software has to be modified. For the implementation of a new sensor, a Sensor module is needed and a new sensor interface and a GUI to capture the sensor parameter values have to be implemented in the Master module. The implementations of the two sensors AISA and ROSIS are described in chapter 4. 4. With the newly developed software modules larger measurement series can be performed automatically in less time. The second part of the thesis was the development of generic characterisation measurement and analysis methods for imaging spectrometers in the wavelength range from 0. 4 μm to 2. 5 μm (chapter 5). The three main types are spectral, geometric and radiometric characterisation. Each of the defined measurement methods describes the setup of the necessary laboratory devices and explains the measurement principle. For the essential device parameters general selection criteria were defined. The developed IDL analysis procedures are generic except for the conversion of the raw data into the defined generic data format (ENVI cube format). Each analysis procedure has quality and error checks. The first and second part of this work have been verified independently using the sensors AISA and ROSIS (chapter 6). The third part of the thesis exemplifies characterisation measurements and data analysis performed for the two above mentioned sensors intending to test the methods and to draw some conclusions from the results...|$|R
