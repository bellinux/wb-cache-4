5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires {{could be used as}} support.|$|E

25|$|Gait {{abnormality}} is a {{deviation from}} normal walking (gait). Watching a patient walk {{is the most}} important part of the neurological examination. Normal gait requires that many systems, including strength, sensation and coordination, function in an integrated fashion. Many common problems in the nervous system and musculoskeletal system will <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way a person walks.|$|E
25|$|In the semiclassical {{approach}} of quantum chaos, phenomena are identified in spectroscopy {{by analyzing the}} statistical distribution of spectral lines and by connecting spectral periodicities with classical orbits. Other phenomena <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> time evolution of a quantum system, or in its response to various types of external forces. In some contexts, such as acoustics or microwaves, wave patterns are directly observable and exhibit irregular amplitude distributions.|$|E
25|$|About 1% of {{hospital}} admissions {{result in an}} adverse event due to negligence. However, mistakes are likely much more common, as these studies identify only mistakes that led to measurable adverse events occurring soon after the errors. Independent review of doctors' treatment plans suggests that decision-making could be improved in 14% of admissions; many of the benefits would have delayed manifestations. Even this number may be an underestimate. One study suggests that adults in the United States receive only 55% of recommended care. At the same time, a second study found that 30% of care in the United States may be unnecessary. For example, if a doctor fails to order a mammogram that is past due, this mistake will not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first type of study. In addition, because no adverse event occurred during the short follow-up of the study, the mistake also would not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second type of study because only the principal treatment plans were critiqued. However, the mistake would be recorded in the third type of study. If a doctor recommends an unnecessary treatment or test, it may not show {{in any of these}} types of studies.|$|E

25|$|Amid the Diocletian Persecutions, Anthony {{wished to}} become a martyr and in 311 went to Alexandria. He visited those who were imprisoned {{for the sake of}} Christ and comforted them. When the Governor saw that he was confessing his Christianity publicly, not caring what might happen to him, he ordered him not to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city. However, the Saint did not heed his threats. He faced him and argued with him in order that he might arouse his anger so that he might be {{tortured}} and martyred, but it did not happen.|$|E
25|$|Measuring the {{percentage}} of applicants who were denied coverage does not capture any effect that occurs before an application is submitted. If individuals with serious health conditions never apply because they expect {{that they will be}} denied coverage, they will not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> declination rate. Conversely, if they apply with multiple insurers in hopes of finding one that will issue them a policy, they will be overrepresented in the declination rate. The 2001 Commonwealth Fund study found that a majority of adults reported that it was at least somewhat difficult to find an affordable health insurance policy. Among adults over 30, {{the percentage}} reporting difficulty did not vary significantly by age. Those with health problems were somewhat more likely to report having difficulty obtaining affordable health insurance (77% versus 64% of those in good health).|$|E

500|$|Table 5 {{shows the}} intransitive {{indicative}} inflection for patient person {{and number of}} the verb neri- [...] "to eat" [...] in the indicative and interrogative moods (question marks mark interrogative intonation—questions have falling intonation on the last syllable as opposed to most Indo-European languages in which questions are marked by rising intonation). The indicative and the interrogative mood each have a transitive and an intransitive inflection, but here only the intransitive inflection is given. Interestingly, consonant gradation like that in Finnish appears to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> verb conjugation (with strengthening to pp in the 3rd person plural and weakening to v elsewhere).|$|E

After Tom dies, George Shelby eulogizes Tom by saying, [...] "What a thing {{it is to be a}} Christian." [...] Because Christian themes play such a large role in Uncle Tom's Cabin—and because of Stowe's frequent use of direct authorial interjections on religion and faith—the novel often takes the [...] "form of a sermon." ...|$|E
500|$|Both {{the opening}} and {{the ending of the}} film were {{reworked}} in various ways. First it would begin with a flashback to Tony's childhood. Then like Iron Man it would begin in medias res, with Tony crashing in Tennessee before a voiceover that would lead to how he got there, until it got changed to the final version. For the climactic tanker battle, it was originally considered that Brandt would <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> James Bond tradition of the henchman coming back for the heroes. Instead they chose to use Killian himself, and have Pepper, whom he abused earlier, cause his downfall as a way of poetic justice. The final dialogue was originally written as [...] "I am Tony Stark" [...] to be a response to the first film's ending, but eventually it changed to [...] "I am Iron Man" [...] to enhance the mythical qualities.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} months of the Obama administration, Biden assumed the role of an {{important}} behind-the-scenes counselor. [...] One role was to adjudicate disputes between Obama's [...] "team of rivals". [...] The president compared Biden's efforts to a basketball player [...] "who does a bunch of things that don't <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stat sheet." [...] Biden {{played a key role in}} gaining Senate support for several major pieces of Obama legislation, and was a main factor in convincing Senator Arlen Specter to switch from the Republican to the Democratic party. [...] Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton regarding his opposition to sending 21,000 new troops to the war in Afghanistan. [...] His skeptical voice was still considered valuable within the administration, however, and later in 2009 Biden's views achieved more prominence within the White House as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.|$|E

Alton then recalls about a funny guy in Korea who got his brains blown out over the Pacific and that [...] "there's nothing funny about that". Jerry (frightened) eventually goes to the bathroom, abandoning George (also frightened), who attempts to compliment Alton about his book, Fair Game. George gets uncomfortable and tells Alton {{he has to make}} a phone call. He meets Jerry in the bathroom and both mention how terrified they are because of Alton; they decide to go home if Elaine does not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next ten minutes. When they return, Alton receives a message from Elaine, who will arrive in thirty minutes, which worries them both.|$|E
500|$|The TV {{portion of}} the game {{received}} a generally positive reception. Andy Kelly from PC Gamer noted its high production values and Takahashi, Gies and Ogilvie praised {{the performance of the}} actors, with Gies singling out Gillen and Reddick as Paul Serene and Martin Hatch respectively. The perspective offered in the TV series was applauded by Houghton, Loveridge, and Ogilvie for successfully filling many gaps in the story and added additional depth to the game's characters, as well as humanizing the game's villains according to Gies and Kelly. Other critics held a completely different opinion, with Paras saying that the show is mediocre and far below the industry's standard, criticizing it for being irrelevant. Reeves felt that the show was unnecessary, since the TV characters rarely <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. Both Orry and Buchholtz criticized the show for disconnecting the player from the game, and that the time spent on working on the TV show could have been saved by using in-engine cutscenes. Peter Brown from GameSpot criticized the show's dialogue, calling them [...] "cheesy", and obvious product placement. The show's costuming is eccentric, and some critics complained of excessive reuse of props throughout the four episodes.|$|E
500|$|The {{premiere of}} Vampyr in Germany was delayed by UFA, as the studio wanted the American films Dracula and Frankenstein to be {{released}} first. The Berlin premiere was 6 May 1932. At this premiere, the audience booed the film which led to Dreyer cutting several scenes out of the film after the first showing. The film was distributed in France by Société Générale de Cinema who also distributed Dreyer's previous film The Passion of Joan of Arc. The Paris premiere was in September 1932 where Vampyr was the opening attraction of a new cinema on the Boulevard Raspail. At a showing of the film in Vienna, audiences demanded their money back. When this was denied, a riot broke out that led to police having to restore order with night sticks. When the film premiered in Copenhagen, Denmark in March 1933, Dreyer did not <b>show</b> <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> USA, the film premiered with English subtitles under the title [...] "Not Against The Flesh"; an English-dubbed version, edited severely as to both the film continuity and the music track, appeared {{a few years later}} on the roadshow circuit as [...] "Castle of Doom". [...] Dreyer soon had a nervous breakdown and went to a mental hospital in France. The film was a financial failure.|$|E
