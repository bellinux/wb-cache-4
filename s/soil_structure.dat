40|$|Possible {{periglacial}} involution structures {{exposed in}} several road cuts within Mesa Verde National Park (MVNP) were documented and analyzed {{to determine whether}} the structures originated from periglacial processes. GIS-based surface analyses including slope, aspect, and timberline approximation were performed to favor north, northeast, and northwest facing slopes, low gradient, and timberline above 2, 400 meters (7, 874 feet). The suitability analysis confirmed that the MVNP area could have sustained periglacial features during the last glacial maximum. The relict <b>soil</b> <b>structures</b> found in the study area were also analyzed based on size, location within the soil layers, soil composition, degree of deformation, and the interpenetration and irregularity of the structures. Based on our analyses, we conclude that the relict structures found in MVNP likely formed by freeze-thaw processes. Other geomorphological processes that could potentially produce similar <b>soil</b> <b>structures,</b> including mass wasting, differential loading, springs, drainage channels, bioturbation, glaciation, and liquefaction, were considered.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityGround reinforcement using stress resisting inclusions in natural ground and in earthwork construction has become widely used. A number of different systems of reinforcement are available, and new ones continue to be developed. However, the behavior of reinforced <b>soil</b> <b>structures</b> has not been fully understood in practice. For example, several researchers have acknowledged the influence of reinforcement stiffness {{on the development of}} tensile forces in the reinforcement; yet, the estimation of the reinforcement forces is still largely empirical. The objectives of this research are: 1) To develop a simplified analytical method for estimating the lateral earth pressure coefficient in reinforced <b>soil</b> <b>structures</b> {{as a function of the}} reinforcement stiffness, the soil stiffness, and the shear transfer between the soil and the reinforcement. 2) To evaluate the suitability of an existing computer program, SSCOMP, for predicting stresses and deformations in reinforced <b>soil</b> <b>structures</b> when a more complete analysis is needed than can be obtained by using the simplified method. The simplified analytical method reasonably predicted the tension in eleven reinforced soil walls. Furthermore, the computed tension using this method, agreed with the results of the finite element analysis. Reasonable quantitative agreement was obtained between the computed reinforcement tension from the finite element analysis and the measured values. However, the agreement was less impressive as far as the deformation is concerned. Success in the application of SSCOMP for cases in which its accuracy could be checked means that SSCOMP can be used to study the influence of different parameters on the behavior of reinforced <b>soil</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is most often}} observed in saturated, loose (low density or uncompacted), sandy soils. This is because a loose sand {{has a tendency to}} compress when a load is applied; dense sands by contrast tend to expand in volume or 'dilate'. If the soil is saturated by water, a condition that often exists when the soil is below the ground water table or sea level, then water fills the gaps between soil grains ('pore spaces'). In response to the soil compressing, this water increases in pressure and attempts to flow out from the soil to zones of low pressure (usually upward towards the ground surface). However, if the loading is rapidly applied and large enough, or is repeated many times (e.g. earthquake shaking, storm wave loading) such that it does not flow out in time before the next cycle of load is applied, the water pressures may build to an extent where they exceed the contact stresses between the grains of soil that keep them in contact with each other. These contacts between grains are the means by which the weight from buildings and overlying soil layers are transferred from the ground surface to layers of soil or rock at greater depths. This loss of <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> causes it to lose all of its strength (the ability to transfer shear stress) and it may be observed to flow like a liquid (hence 'liquefaction').|$|E

O uso de apenas este tipo de solos pode proporcionar o aumento, por vezes insustentรกvel, do custo da execuรงรฃo das estruturas e o aumento do seu impacto ambiental. Deste modo, as estruturas de solo reforรงado perdem a sua vantagem competitiva em relaรงรฃo a outros tipos de estruturas (muros de betรฃo, muros de gravidade, muros de gabiรตes, etc.). Para {{resolver}} este problema podem ser utilizados outros tipos de solos (solos locais, finos, com propriedades fรญsicas e mecรขnicas piores mas, no entanto, mais baratos) para a execuรงรฃo deste tipo de estruturas. De forma geral, com este estudo pretendeu-se contribuir para o incremento do conhecimento sobre a utilizaรงรฃo de solos finos para a construรงรฃo de estruturas de solo reforรงado (muros e taludes). Para tal avaliaram-se as diferenรงas no comportamento mecรขnico dos materiais compรณsitos (solo granular reforรงado versus solo fino reforรงado) e das estruturas de solo reforรงado constituรญdas com os dois tipos de solos. Assim, os objetivos deste estudo foram avaliar: a influรชncia de vรกrios parรขmetros nas propriedades mecรขnicas e na capacidade de carga dos solos reforรงados com geossintรฉticos; a influรชncia de vรกrios parรขmetros no dimensionamento das estruturas de solo reforรงado; e o comportamento das estruturas dimensionadas (incluindo a estabilidade global e a influรชncia do processo construtivo) recorrendo a uma ferramenta numรฉrica (PLAXIS). Para cumprir os objetivos propostos foram realizadas anรกlises experimentais em laboratรณrio (anรกlise do comportamento do solo reforรงado atravรฉs de ensaios triaxiais e de California Bearing Ratio) e anรกlises numรฉricas (dimensionamento de estruturas de solo reforรงado; modelaรงรฃo numรฉrica do comportamento atravรฉs de uma ferramenta numรฉrica comercial com o mรฉtodo dos elementos finitos). Os resultados dos ensaios experimentais mostraram que o comportamento mecรขnico e a capacidade de carga do solo foram incrementados com a inclusรฃo das camadas de geossintรฉtico. Este efeito variou com os diversos parรขmetros analisados mas, de forma geral, foi mais importante no solo fino (solo com propriedades mecรขnicas piores). As anรกlises numรฉricas mostraram que as estruturas de solo fino precisaram de maior densidade de reforรงos para serem estรกveis. Alรฉm disso, as estruturas de solo fino foram mais deformรกveis e o efeito do seu processo construtivo foi mais importante (principalmente para estruturas de solo fino saturado). The geosynthetic reinforced <b>soil</b> <b>structures</b> usually {{consist of}} granular soils with good physical and mechanical properties. The use of only {{this type of}} soils can provide an unsustainable increase in the execution cost of such structures and of their environmental impact. In addition, {{the benefit of the}} reinforced <b>soil</b> <b>structures</b> related to the other types of structures (concrete walls, gravity walls, gabions walls, etc.) could be missed. For this reason, other types of soils, local soils, fine soils, cheaper, but also with worst physical and mechanical characteristics, can be used for the execution of these structures. Overall, this study aims to contribute to increasing the knowledge on the use of fine soil for the construction of reinforced <b>soil</b> <b>structures</b> (walls and embankments). For this purpose, the differences in the mechanical behaviour of composite materials (reinforced granular soil versus reinforced fine soil) and reinforced <b>soil</b> <b>structures</b> made with two types of soils were evaluated. Thus, the objectives of this study were to evaluate: the influence of several parameters on the mechanical properties and bearing capacity of the reinforced soil; the influence of several parameters on the design of reinforced soil structures; and the behaviour of the designed structures (including the verification of the global stability and the effect of the constructive process) using a numerical tool (PLAXIS). In order to fulfil those goals, experimental laboratory analysis (analysis of reinforced soil behaviour through triaxial and California Bearing Ratio tests) and numerical analysis (design of reinforced <b>soil</b> <b>structures</b> and numerical modelling of the behaviour of reinforced <b>soil</b> <b>structures</b> using a commercial numerical tool with finite element method) were carried out. The results of experimental tests showed that the mechanical behaviour and the soil bearing capacity were increased with the inclusion of the geosynthetic layers. This effect ranged with the several parameters analysed but, in general, was more important in the fine soil (soil with poor mechanical properties). The numerical analysis showed that the fine <b>soil</b> <b>structures</b> needed a higher density of reinforcement to be stable. In addition, the fine <b>soil</b> <b>structures</b> were more deformable and the effect of their construction process was more important (especially for fine saturated <b>soil</b> <b>structures).</b> Doutoramento em Engenharia Civil...|$|R
