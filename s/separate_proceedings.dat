25|$|Meanwhile, {{condemnation}} proceeded {{against other}} property {{owners in the}} area. At this time, the eminent domain procedures governing the District of Columbia required the city to condemn land, and for the landowner to fight the condemnation in court before a jury. The jury then determined if the condemnation was required, and what compensation should be awarded the property owner. In two <b>separate</b> <b>proceedings,</b> juries found land to be worth just 1 cent per square foot. Senator James McMillan (R-Michigan), chair of the Senate District of Columbia Committee, brought S.2637 {{to the floor of}} the Senate on June 24. McMillan argued that the cemetery trustees were not opposed to the road, just to the price to be paid for the condemned land. Senator George Graham Vest (D-Missouri) asked that the bill be temporarily tabled, and it was. On July 14, Senator Matt Whitaker Ransom (D-North Carolina) presented the Senate with a petition from 1,000 cemetery lotholders opposed to the Senate and House bills. (PHC director George Wagner later characterized the dispute over lotholder support as one Senator lying to another.) The objections raised by Vest and other senators were seemingly resolved by July 24, when McMillan again called the bill for a vote on the Senate floor. One change to the bill had been made, providing for federally-financed construction of a retaining wall on cemetery property if one was needed. But once more the bill was put on hold. Senator David Turpie (D-Indiana) objected to the bill overall, and Senator Francis Cockrell (D-Missouri) wanted a cap put on the price of the compensation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{bifurcated}} patent litigation systems, {{claims of}} infringement {{and validity of}} a patent are decided independently {{of each other in}} <b>separate</b> court <b>proceedings</b> at different courts. In non-bifurcated systems, infringement and validity are decided jointly in the same proceedings at a single court. We build a model that shows the key trade-off between bifurcated and non-bifurcated systems and how it affects the incentives of plaintiffs and defendants in patent infringement cases. Using detailed data on patent litigation cases in Germany (bifurcated) and the U. K. (non-bifurcated), we show that bifurcation creates situations in which a patent is held infringed that is subsequently invalidated. We also show that having to challenge a patent's validity in <b>separate</b> court <b>proceedings</b> under bifurcation implies that alleged infringers are less likely to do so. We find this to apply in particular to more resource-constrained alleged infringers. Finally, we find parties to be more likely to settle in a bifurcated system...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of planned economy in Russia after the 1917 October Revolution had {{a result that}} the whole economy was treated as one state owned organization. From 1922 the courts’ jurisdiction in cases between state owned enterprises was abolished and these cases were transferred to arbitration committees. On May 3, 1931 the state’s economic arbitration was established. It was separated completely from the courts’ system and was included into administration structures. It had {{nothing in common with}} the private arbitration and with the conciliatory proceedings. The state’s arbitration was an instrument of central planning and its activity were to strengthen the realization of economic plans. By doing it, the state’s arbitration performed two functions in the management of economy. It could pass legal acts on one side and on the other it considered the economic disputes between state institutions. From 1931 to October 1, 1991 (when arbitration was abolished) its functions have not been changed. The analysis of legal character of this institution causes problems and controversies among lawyers. The state’s arbitration was a hybrid. It was bounded with the administration and the arbitrators, very often not being lawyers, were not independent. From the other hand, the arbitration proceedings was somehow connected with the proceedings applied in the courts. Despite that, it should be treated as a <b>separated</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The state’s arbitration was an administrative, not judicial body...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of the {{probabilistic}} nature of patents on the functioning of Germany's bifurcated patent litigation system where infringement and validity of a patent are decided independently by different courts. We show that bifurcation creates situations in which a patent is held infringed that is subsequently invalidated. Our conservative estimates indicate that 12 % of infringement cases in which the patent's validity is challenged produce such 'invalid but infringed' decisions. We also show that having to challenge a patent's validity in <b>separate</b> court <b>proceedings</b> means that more resource-constrained alleged infringers are less likely to do so. We find evidence that 'invalid but infringed' decisions create uncertainty which firms that were found to infringe an invalid patent attempt to reduce by filing more oppositions against newly granted patents immediately afterwards...|$|R
