"The major {{steps in}} the {{preparation}} of smoked fish are salting (bath or injection of liquid brine or dry salt mixture), cold smoking, cooling, packaging (air/vacuum or modified), and storage. Smoking, one of the oldest preservation methods, combines the effects of salting, drying, heating and smoking. Typical <b>smoking</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> is either cold (28-32°C) or hot (70-80°C). Cold smoking does not cook the flesh, coagulate the proteins, inactivate food spoilage enzymes, or eliminate the food pathogens, and hence refrigerated storage is necessary until consumption", although dry cured hams are cold smoked and require no refrigeration.|$|E

The predominant processing and preservation techniques employed is smoke-drying (93. 75 %) with sundrying accounting for 6. 25 %. Two types of traditional smoking kiln used were oil drum and raffia palm racks. Firewood and kerosine are the main combustion fuels used during smoke-drying.

40|$|Introduction : <b>Smoking</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> {{has changed}} its {{function}} nowadays from just the preservative task to flavoring and coloring. The method of smoking {{has also been}} developed from traditional, which had used a simple technology to the modern method. In recent years, preparation of liquid smoke manufactured from certain varieties of wood pyrolysates have been successfully used {{as a substitute for}} the traditional smoking in a kiln. Material and methods : The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the effect of cold smoking of mackerel fish on the proximate composition, water activity, salt content and microbial aspect of smoked fish treated using oak sawdust and liquid smoke either salted or un-salted. Sensory analysis was carried out by using score sheet organoleptic and hedonic test. Identification of pathogenic bacteria was done by API- 20 E method. Factorial design was administered to compare the effect of traditional and liquid smoke method to brined and unbrined smoked fish. Results and Discussion : The content of protein, lipid, water activity and salt of the two products were not significantly different (p> 0. 05). This means that the quality between two products were similar. Only moisture content of the products were very significantly different (p> 0. 01) caused by the phenomenon of osmosis between moisture of fish and brine. Study of liquid smoke treatment was found that liquid smoke was easier compared to oak sawdust smoke. It was also found that smoking reduces the number of colonies of bacteria. The number of colonies were about 1 x 103 /g – 5 x 103 /g after 2 day storage for unbrined smoked fish, while in brined smoked fish, no colonies were found after 3 day storage. Pseudomonas sp were present in both raw mackerel and the unbrined smoked fish sample, but were absent in the brined smoked fish...|$|E
40|$|Until {{recently}} CO 2 {{has been}} utilized as an anesthetic method before gill cutting of Norwegian Atlantic salmon farmed fish. From 1. July 2012 {{this is no}} longer permitted in Norway since it causes strong aversive reactions and severe stress to the animal. In the search for alternative methods for sedation and anesthesia carbon monoxide (CO) has gained interest. In our project, studies demonstrate that CO treatment has a positive effect on product quality and animal welfare. The use of CO in slaughtering, processing and packaging of muscle foods has been reviewed. The present thesis focuses on how sedation of Atlantic salmon with CO affects animal welfare and quality of fish when used as an alternative method prior to anaesthetization. CO is widely used in meat and fish industry for <b>smoking</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> or packaging of meat to maintain product quality. In this study CO was used to sedate salmon by diffusion of the gas in seawater tanks with fish. The level of CO in the seawater was estimated on the basis of oxygen level measured in the seawater and the length of time of diffusion. The methodology to measure CO in water by use of GC-chromatography was not until recently available in our laboratories. Behavior analysis and cortisol levels indicate that CO treatment may result in a more calm fish, not showing increased cortisol values compared to other treatments but rather a tendency of the opposite. However, at high levels of CO a more rapid swimming activity was observed. Another effect was a more rapid onset of rigor mortis and a faster decrease in pH observed in CO exposed salmon compared to the control group. Early onset of rigor mortis could indicate stressed fish, but in this case a more likely explanation is the anaerobic metabolism as a secondary response of CO treatment. Moreover, fillet from CO treated salmon showed a higher degree of red color. Mackerel fillets exposed to CO also showed a perceptible more red color. Both fillets of salmon and mackerel are rich in Mb compared to e. g. cod fishes. In the search for factors with a controlling effect on CO we focused on a recently discovered globin located in nerve tissue, neuroglobin (Ngb). Ngb has been shown to protect the brain during stress and hypoxia in fish. Ngb was detected in salmon brain tissue, but only in small amounts, 1 - 10 μg/g, after immune prespitation and western analysis. Thus in order to study salmon neuroglobin (sNgb) in more detail, we cloned and expressed the protein in E. coli. Recombinant sNgb showed a strong response using a salmon Ngb specific antibody, raised against the C-terminal peptide of sNgb. Homology modeling of 3 D structures of sNgb and mouse neuroglobin indicated that sNgb has a more flexible structure compared to the mammalian neuroglobins that have typical psychrophilic characteristics. <p...|$|E

Fish smoked with Anogeissus leiocarpus recorded lower moisture, but higher dry matter, ash and crude protein content in comparison to fish smoked with Tamarindus indica.

40|$|ObjectiveDespite {{available}} medical therapies, {{patients with}} {{peripheral arterial disease}} (PAD) remain {{at high risk for}} cardiovascular events. The n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), derived from marine sources, have been shown to improve cardiovascular mortality. The Omega- 3 Index (O 3 I), a proportion of the n- 3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in the red blood cell membrane, correlates with cardiovascular risk. Previous investigations have found that n- 3 PUFA supplementation, fish consumption, older age, and smoking history affect the O 3 I in different patient populations, although similar correlations have never been explored in PAD. We hypothesized that in our PAD cohort, blood content of omega- 3 fatty acids would directly and positively correlate with a history <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> oil supplementation and older age and inversely correlate with a smoking history and obesity. MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 111 patients who had an ankle-brachial index of < 0. 9 associated with claudication symptoms. We used linear regression to determine the association between clinical factors and the O 3 I. ResultsThe mean age of the cohort was 69  ± 8  years; 37 % had diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A 1 c, 7 % ± 1 %), and 94 % reported current smoking or a history <b>of</b> <b>smoking.</b> The mean O 3 I was 5 % ± 2 %.
