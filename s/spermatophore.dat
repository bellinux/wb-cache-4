5|$|The {{majority}} of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation. In most of these, the male deposits a <b>spermatophore,</b> a small packet of sperm {{on top of}} a gelatinous cone, on the substrate either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent. The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the <b>spermatophore</b> vary between species. In some, the <b>spermatophore</b> may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the <b>spermatophore</b> or restrained with an embrace called amplexus. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, Hynobiidae and Cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproduction}} of octopuses {{has been studied}} {{in only a few}} species. One such species is the giant Pacific octopus, in which courtship is accompanied, especially in the male, by changes in skin texture and colour. The male may cling to the top or side of the female or position himself beside her. There is some speculation that he may first use his hectocotylus to remove any <b>spermatophore</b> or sperm already present in the female. He picks up a <b>spermatophore</b> from his spermatophoric sac with the hectocotylus, inserts it into the female's mantle cavity, and deposits it in the correct location for the species, which in the giant Pacific octopus is the opening of the oviduct. Two spermatophores are transferred in this way; these are about one metre (yard) long, and the empty ends may protrude from the female's mantle. A complex hydraulic mechanism releases the sperm from the <b>spermatophore,</b> and it is stored internally by the female.|$|E
5|$|Sperm {{competition}} and chemicals introduced to females through mating {{have a negative}} effect on females and their lifespan. In males, production of the <b>spermatophore,</b> sperm, and secondary chemicals reduces their lifespan. As the number of copulations increase, the rate of mortality also increases in both sexes.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>spermatophores</b> is widespread in earthworms {{from the family}} Lumbricidae but their function remains un-clear. We tested three functional hypotheses (sperm transfer, nuptial gift and copulatory plugs) to explain the {{presence of}} these structures in the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Oligochaeta, Lumbricidae). None of the hypotheses tested were sup-ported from our results and we found that <b>spermatophores</b> had no effect on the reproductive success of this earthworm species. <b>Spermatophores</b> appeared in all the matings that produced cocoons and hence may be used as reliable indicators of a recent copulation. Key words: Earthworm reproduction, <b>spermatophores,</b> nuptial gift, copulatory plug, Eisenia fetida In earthworms from the family Lumbricidae (Oligo-chaeta), <b>spermatophores</b> have often been described. <b>Spermatophores</b> are defined as capsules formed by glands in the neighbourhood of the male pore, filled with spermatozoa and placed on the body of the partner (Michaelsen 1926). In most lumbricids <b>spermatophores</b> appear frequently after mating. Nevertheless, the cur-rent knowledge about them is based only on anatomica...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of Gastropoda Vermetidae <b>spermatophores</b> is recorded. They {{correspond to the}} <b>spermatophores</b> of the species Thylacodes arenarius (L., 1758) (= Serpulorbis arenarius (L., 1767)). The morphological characteristics of the different <b>spermatophores</b> observed are showed and the records are analyzed {{in the light of}} the reproductive strategies of such aphallic sessile invertebrates...|$|R
50|$|Some {{vertebrates}} also reproduce via <b>spermatophores.</b> Males of most salamander and newt species create <b>spermatophores,</b> {{which the}} females {{may choose to}} take up or not, depending {{on the success of}} the male's mating display.|$|R
5|$|Schilthuizen et al. (2005) {{described}} the spatial {{structure of a}} population of A. inversus in Malaysia. Schilthuizen et al. (2007) found that there is sexual selection in mating with snails of the opposite chirality. This means that the left-handed snails mate more often with right-handed snails than they do with snails of the same coiling. Additionally there are anatomical adaptations of the <b>spermatophore</b> and of the female part of the reproductive system {{for the success of}} these matings.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{is often}} aerial and often {{involves}} pheromones. Butterflies then {{land on the}} ground or on a perch to mate. Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. Simple photoreceptor cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours. The male passes a <b>spermatophore</b> to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may cover her with his scent, or in some species such as the Apollos (Parnassius) plugs her genital opening to prevent her from mating again.|$|E
5|$|Crested and marbled newts {{live and}} breed in vegetation-rich ponds or similar aquatic {{habitats}} {{for two to}} six months and usually {{spend the rest of}} the year in shady, protection-rich land habitats close to their breeding sites. Males court females with a ritualised display, ending in the deposition of a <b>spermatophore</b> that is picked up by the female. After fertilisation, a female lays 200–400 eggs, folding them individually into leaves of water plants. Larvae develop over two to four months before metamorphosing into land-dwelling juveniles.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "penis" [...] in most unshelled male {{cephalopods}} (Coleoidea) is a {{long and}} muscular end of the gonoduct used to transfer <b>spermatophores</b> to a modified arm called a hectocotylus. That in turn is used to transfer the <b>spermatophores</b> to the female. In species where the hectocotylus is missing, the [...] "penis" [...] is long and able to extend beyond the mantle cavity and transfer the <b>spermatophores</b> directly to the female.|$|R
50|$|An ovipore is a pore-like sexual {{organ of}} a female insect that gets inseminated by the <b>spermatophores</b> ejected by the {{aedeagus}} of a male insect during copulation. The <b>spermatophores</b> that pass through the ovipore are stored in most insect species in another organ called spermatheca.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of release of sperm from crustacean <b>spermatophores</b> {{has long been}} debated. Many factors such as external physical pressure, inbibition of water by substances within and an Qviducal secretion have been suggested {{to be responsible for}} the opening up of <b>spermatophores</b> (Mouchet/ 1931; Bloch, 1935; Subramoniam, 1977) ...|$|R
5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single <b>spermatophore</b> is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E
5|$|When {{copulation}} takes place, {{the male}} butterfly or moth places a capsule of sperm (<b>spermatophore)</b> in a receptacle {{of the female}} (called the corpus bursae). The sperm, when released from the capsule, swims directly into or via a small tube into a special seminal receptacle (spermatheca), where the sperm is stored until it is released into the vagina for fertilisation during egg laying, which may occur hours, days, or months after mating. The eggs pass through the ovipore. The ovipore {{may be at the}} end of a modified ovipositor or surrounded by a pair of broad setose anal papillae.|$|E
5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and <b>spermatophore</b> transfer.|$|E
50|$|The sperm of {{arthropods}} is {{not passed}} to the female as liquid with free-swimming spermatozoa, but contains capsules called <b>spermatophores</b> in which the actual spermatozoa are enclosed. In addition to the <b>spermatophores,</b> in some species the aedeagus also discharges a spermatophylax, a ball of nutritious secretions to aid the female in producing offspring.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In Uca triangularis bengali, when mating occurs, the <b>spermatophores</b> get {{stored in}} the {{spermatheca}} which in turn induces the maturation of the ovary. The sperm plug prevents further mating and the <b>spermatophores</b> are released in batches. By the time the spermatheca is empty, the ovary reaches the advanced stage of maturation and mature eggs are released for fertilization...|$|R
50|$|In mating, {{the male}} {{deposits}} <b>spermatophores</b> {{on the underside}} of the female's thorax, between the walking legs. The female then extrudes eggs, which pass through the <b>spermatophores.</b> The female carries the fertilised eggs with her until they hatch; the time may vary, but is generally less than three weeks. Females lay 10,000-50,000 eggs up to five times per year.|$|R
5|$|Adult {{butterflies}} consume only liquids, ingested {{through the}} proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, {{from which they}} obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and {{studies have suggested that}} the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift, along with the <b>spermatophore,</b> during mating.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{aggregate}} {{in large}} numbers (>20 individuals) under rocks and logs along the immediate edge of the breeding sites and breed explosively over a few days. Suitable breeding sites include small fish-free ponds, marshes, shallow lakes and other still-water wetlands. Like other ambystomatid salamanders, they have evolved a characteristic courtship dance where they rub bodies and release pheromones from their chin gland prior to assuming a copulatory mating position. Once in position, the male deposits a <b>spermatophore,</b> which is a gooey stalk tipped with a packet of sperm, and walks the female forward to be inseminated. Males may mate more than once and may deposit as many as 15 spermatophores {{over the course of}} a five-hour period. The courtship dance for the long-toed salamander is similar to other species of Ambystoma and very similar to A.jeffersonianum. In the long-toed salamander, there is no rubbing or head-butting; the males directly approach females and grab on, while the females try to rapidly swim away. The males clasp the female from behind the forelimbs and shake, a behavior called amplexus. Males sometimes clasp other amphibian species during breeding and shake them as well. The male only grabs with the front limbs and never uses his hind limbs during the courtship dance as he rubs his chin side to side pressing down on the female's head. The female struggles but later becomes subdued. Males increase the tempo and motions, rubbing over the female's nostrils, sides, and sometimes the vent. When the female becomes quite docile the male moves forward with his tail positioned over her head, raised, and waving at the tip. If the female accepts the males courtship, the male directs her snout toward his vent region while both move forward stiffly with pelvic undulations. As the female follows, the male stops and deposits a <b>spermatophore,</b> and the female will move forward with the male to raise her tail and receive the sperm packet. The full courtship dance is rarely accomplished in the first attempt. Females deposit their eggs a few days after mating.|$|E
5|$|Danube crested newts {{have the}} longest aquatic {{phase in the}} genus Triturus. Adults move to their {{breeding}} sites in February or March and usually stay there for six months; occasionally, they may even stay longer or return to the water in autumn. Males court females with a display of ritualised body movements. When they have gained the female's interest, they guide it over a <b>spermatophore</b> they deposit on the ground, which the female then takes up with her cloaca. The eggs are fertilised internally. As in other crested newts, a female lays around 200 eggs per season, which are folded individually into leaves of aquatic plants. Larvae develop over two to four months until they reach metamorphosis and leave the water.|$|E
40|$|During mating male bushcrickets {{transfer}} large <b>spermatophores,</b> {{which have}} been demonstrated {{to play an important}} role in female nutrition and egg production. Until now only relatively unspeci¢c substances such as water and proteins were known to be present within these <b>spermatophores.</b> We found that in the bushcricket Ephippiger zelleri the <b>spermatophores</b> contain substantial amounts of carotenoids (mainly lutein and zeaxanthin) that are also found in the eggs of this species. Carotenoids are well known for their positive e¡ects on survival and reproduction in animals. This is the ¢rst example, to our knowledge, where such speci¢c vitamin-like substances were found to be transferred from male to female during mating...|$|R
40|$|Animal species {{usually have}} a single sperm-storage site in the female body, but females of the squid Heterololigo bleekeri possess two {{distinct}} sperm-storage sites simultaneously. Use of two sperm-storage sites correlates with alternative male mating behaviours: large consorts guard females and place <b>spermatophores</b> inside the oviduct just before spawning, whereas small ?sneaker? males place <b>spermatophores</b> on the membrane around the female?s mouth within the arm crown, where a seminal receptacle is present. Previous work showed that permatophore and sperm morphology diverge between consort and sneaker males. Here we show novel dichotomous adaptations in the sperm-transfer strategy of males of this squid, {{associated with the use}} of two distinct sperm-storage sites on females. The spermatangia ejaculated from <b>spermatophores</b> were clearly dimorphic: all spermatangia ejaculated from <b>spermatophores</b> smaller than 12 mm from small sneaker males were drop-shaped, whereas all spermatangia from <b>spermatophores</b> longer than 12 mm from larger consort males were rope-shaped. In addition, the drop shaped spermatangia were distinct in having a spine on their base, which might reduce the risk of it being shed from the female?s body surface. Our findings suggest that existence of alternative sperm storage sites, and related biological and environmental factors, lead to the evolution of divergent sperm transfer strategies...|$|R
50|$|The genus is parasitic, manly on serpulid polychaete worms. They {{are known}} to have <b>spermatophores.</b>|$|R
5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs. The front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has {{a pair of}} clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female's vagina. A <b>spermatophore</b> is deposited in the female, following which the sperm {{make their way to}} a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species. After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with hemolymph and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.|$|E
5|$|Coconut crabs mate {{frequently}} and quickly {{on dry land}} in the period from May to September, especially between early June and late August. Male coconut crabs have spermatophores and deposit a mass of spermatophores on the abdomen of the female; the abdomen opens {{at the base of}} the third pereiopods, and fertilisation is thought to occur on the external surface of the abdomen as the eggs pass through the <b>spermatophore</b> mass. The extrusion of eggs occurs on land in crevices or burrows near the shore. Shortly thereafter, the female lays her eggs and glues them to the underside of her abdomen, carrying the fertilised eggs underneath her body for a few months. At the time of hatching, the female coconut crab releases the eggs into the ocean. This usually takes place on rocky shores at dusk, especially when this coincides with high tide. The empty egg cases remain on the female's body after the larvae have been released, and the female eats the egg cases within a few days.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species have}} a sperm {{transplant}} mechanism. Crickets are one such species that can prematurely remove <b>spermatophore</b> after copulation, which terminates sperm transfer. In one study, males {{were randomly assigned}} to females to create half-sib families to determine the heritability of <b>spermatophore</b> retention time in females. The researchers found that there was additive genetic variance in the timing of <b>spermatophore</b> removal by females. These results suggest that the timing of the <b>spermatophore</b> removal is determined partly by genotype and is independent of the quality of a female's mate. This shows no difference between the fitness of females who freely remove the <b>spermatophore</b> and the fitness of females that are forced to accept complete ejaculates.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the biology of the members of this genus. As is true of most members of the Pyramidellidae sensu lato, they are most likely ectoparasites. It has been {{reported}} living on the serpulid polychaete Pomatoleios kraussi (Barird) which is likely the host.Hori & Kuroda (2001) described <b>spermatophores</b> from the species Iolaea scitula. <b>Spermatophores</b> are also known from other members of the Chrysallidinae.|$|R
2500|$|Males {{can reach}} a body size of 32cm; females grow to 25cm. In mating, the male {{deposits}} <b>spermatophores</b> {{on the underside}} of the female's thorax, between the walking legs. The female then extrudes eggs, which pass through the <b>spermatophores.</b> The female carries the fertilized eggs with her until they hatch; the time may vary, but is generally less than three weeks. A large female may lay up to 100,000 eggs.|$|R
50|$|In {{most species}} of butterflies, pheromones {{play a role}} in {{courtship}} and mate recognition, and can {{play a role in}} deterring mates. <b>Spermatophores</b> contain anaphrodisiacs, pheromones that reduce the attractiveness of the females to subsequent males, indicating evolution driven by intrasexual selection between males. These reduce male harassment of mated females. <b>Spermatophores</b> contain nonfertile sperm (apyrene) to increase the anaphrodisiac effect. The transfer of anaphrodisiacs thus reduces female mating choice.|$|R
25|$|During copulation, sperm is {{transferred}} from male to female inside a <b>spermatophore.</b> There are several theories regarding the adaptive value of using a <b>spermatophore.</b> It contains certain chemicals that may inhibit the female’s sex drive. Alternatively, it may physically plug the female’s gonophore. In either explanation, the <b>spermatophore</b> prevents the female from reproducing with another male. In essence, {{the use of a}} <b>spermatophore</b> is evolutionarily favorable because it increases the probability of the male’s genetic code being transferred to subsequent generations by lessening potential competition from other males.|$|E
25|$|When {{the male}} has {{identified}} a suitable location, he deposits the <b>spermatophore</b> and then guides the female over it. This allows the <b>spermatophore</b> to enter her genital opercula, which triggers {{release of the}} sperm, thus fertilising the female. The mating process can take from 1 to 25+ hours and depends {{on the ability of}} the male to find a suitable place to deposit his <b>spermatophore.</b> If mating continues too long, the female may lose interest, ending the process.|$|E
25|$|Courtship {{occurs in}} two phases. During the aerial phase, a male pursues and often forces a female to the ground. During the ground phase, the {{butterflies}} copulate and remain attached for about 30 to 60 minutes. Only 30% of mating attempts end in copulation, suggesting that females {{may be able}} to avoid mating, though some have more success than others. During copulation, a male transfers his <b>spermatophore</b> to a female. Along with sperm, the <b>spermatophore</b> provides a female with nutrition, which aids her in egg laying. An increase in <b>spermatophore</b> size increases the fecundity of female monarchs. Males that produce larger spermatophores also fertilize more females' eggs.|$|E
50|$|In the male, the {{position}} of testis from juvenile to adult is different. The position of testis moved backward until it reached the final position at the hinder end of the body during the adult stage. Fully mature male octopus consist of fully- formed <b>spermatophores</b> in the Needham’s sac. They usually had up to 13 <b>spermatophores</b> in the Needham’s sac. Furthermore, their reproductive organ will increase in size over the lifetime.|$|R
