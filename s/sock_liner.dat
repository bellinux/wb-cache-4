25|$|The insole is the {{interior}} {{bottom of a}} shoe, which sits directly beneath the foot under the footbed (also known as <b>sock</b> <b>liner).</b> The purpose of insole is to attach to the lasting margin of the upper, which is wrapped around the last during {{the closing of the}} shoe during the lasting operation. Insoles are usually made of cellulosic paper board or synthetic non woven insole board. Many shoes have removable and replaceable footbeds. Extra cushioning is often added for comfort (to control the shape, moisture, or smell of the shoe) or health reasons (to help deal with differences in the natural shape of the foot or positioning of the foot during standing or walking).|$|E
5000|$|The Chuck Taylor All Star and Stripes, Shoe - Romanelli was {{the first}} artist to {{collaborate}} with Converse when the Chuck Taylor All Star shoes were first introduced. The All Star and Stripes shoe, with the All Star silhouette and futuristic touches, debuted in June 2010. The shoes were a combination of classic Converse style and modern details as Romanelli regularly fuses vintage Americana while using a modern approach. Romanelli added stars and stripes to {{two versions of the}} shoe and both versions incorporated clean uppers with 12-ounce duck canvas and leather with antiqued details that together make up the stripes of the American flag. Wool toe caps lent the feeling of a vintage peacoat and gum soles added to the classic look and feel of the shoe. In addition, Romanellis abbreviated [...] "Dr. X" [...] moniker appeared on the tongue and a unique rendition of the American Eagle could be found on the <b>sock</b> <b>liner.</b> The shoe was available in high-top leather and duck canvas with wool toe caps and gum soles.|$|E
40|$|Elevated stump skin {{temperatures}} {{and the accompanying}} thermal discomfort are side effects of prosthesis use that may reduce amputee quality of life, particularly in hot or humid surroundings. Lower skin temperatures might be achieved through more effective heat transfer in the prosthesis, a process governed {{in part by the}} thermal conductivity of the <b>sock,</b> <b>liner,</b> and socket layers. To assess the thermodynamic properties of currently available components, an instrument capable of measuring the heat flux across a regulated temperature differential was developed. Experimental results show that the thermal conductivity ranged from 0. 085 – 0. 266 W/m 8 K for liner materials and from 0. 148 – 0. 150 W/m 8 K for socket materials. The results of this study demonstrate that the prescription of typical multi-layer prostheses constructed with the higher thermal conductivity materials might reduce temperature-related discomfort in patients...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the affect of SkyFlex training would have on jumping ability. The SkyFlex is a shoe constructed with a forefoot platform elevating the heel. The design purports enhancement of the stretch reflex in the Gastrocnemius and Soleus muscles. The SkyFlex includes an Airlon Flexfit <b>sock</b> <b>liner</b> designed to keep the ankle warm during training, minimizing tightness and flexibility reductions. Division I varsity male volleyball players (n= 17) were tested for the following: standing vertical jump, approach jump, court sprint, shuttle run, and anthropometry. Two-way AN OVA found no statistical significance (p< 0. 05) on any of the variables except for the differences between sessions of reaction forces.

40|$|Each {{time the}} foot {{contacts}} the ground during running {{there is a}} rapid deceleration that results in a shock wave that is transmitted from the foot to the head. The fatigue of the musculoskeletal system during running may decrease {{the ability of the}} body to absorb those shock waves and increase the risk of injury. Insoles are commonly prescribed to prevent injuries, and both custom-made and prefabricated insoles have been observed to reduce shock accelerations during running. However, no study to date has included a direct comparison of their behaviour measured over the same group of athletes, and therefore great controversy still exists regarding their effectiveness in reducing impact loading during running. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyse the acute differences in stride and shock parameters while running on a treadmill with custom-made and prefabricated insoles. Stride parameters (stride length, stride rate) and shock acceleration parameters (head and tibial peak acceleration, shock magnitude, acceleration rate, and shock attenuation) were measured using two triaxial accelerometers in 38 runners at 3. 33 m/s before and after a 15 -min intense run while using the <b>sock</b> <b>liner</b> of the shoe (control condition), prefabricated insoles and custom-made insoles. No differences in shock accelerations were found between the custom-made and the control insoles. The prefabricated insoles increased the head acceleration rate (post-fatigue, p = 0. 029) compared to the control condition. The custom-made reduced tibial (pre-fatigue, p = 0. 041) and head acceleration rates (pre-fatigue and post-fatigue, p = 0. 01 and p = 0. 046) compared to the prefabricated insoles. Neither the stride nor the acceleration parameters were modified as a result of the intense run. In the present study, the acute use of insoles (custom-made, prefabricated) did not reduce shock accelerations compared to the control insoles. Therefore, their effectiveness at protecting against injuries associated with elevated accelerations is not supported and remains unclear...|$|E

50|$|Appropriate {{clothing}} {{helps to}} prevent hypothermia. Synthetic and wool fabrics {{are superior to}} cotton as they provide better insulation when wet and dry. Some synthetic fabrics, such as polypropylene and polyester, are used in clothing designed to wick perspiration away from the body, such as <b>liner</b> <b>socks</b> and moisture-wicking undergarments. Clothing should be loose fitting, as tight clothing reduces the circulation of warm blood. In planning outdoor activity, prepare appropriately for possible cold weather.

5000|$|Even {{before a}} [...] "hot" [...] or irritated {{area on the}} foot is felt, taping a {{protective}} layer of padding or a friction-reducing interface between the affected area and the footwear can prevent {{the formation of a}} blister. Bandages, moleskin and tapes generally must be applied to the foot daily, and most have a very high coefficient of friction (COF), but a friction-management patch applied to the shoe will remain in place much longer, throughout many changes of socks and insoles. This type of intervention may be used with footwear that is worn daily, with specialty shoes and boots like hockey skates, ice skates, inline skates, ski boots and cleats, or even with orthotic braces and splints. For periods of sustained use such as hiking and trail running, especially where water ingress or moisture build up in the shoe or boot can occur, moisture wicking <b>liner</b> <b>socks</b> can provide the required friction protection.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBesides {{mechanical}} properties {{the quality of}} ski boots is determined by their comfort characteristics. Boot climate is a major comfort measure, especially cold feet affect comfort. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the microclimate in ski boots during skiing. The boot climate was assessed by temperature, relative humidity and water absorption. Temperature and relative humidity were measured using 4 sensors placed on the foot above the metatarsophalangeal joints of the first and second toe, in the arch of the foot sole, on the dorsum of the foot above os cuneiforme II, and between liner and shell at the medial ankle. To determine the amount of absorbed water in <b>liners</b> and <b>socks</b> a precision balance was used. Two subjects were recorded during five skiing days. Two low and two high quality ski boots of two different boot producers were used for the tests. During all measurements the temperature inside the ski boot decreased when skiing at ambient temperature between - 6. 8 °C and 6. 0 °C. The temperature at the toes dropped in four cases clearly below 20 °C. High relative humidity values up to 93 % and high water absorption in <b>socks</b> and <b>liners</b> up to 45. 5 g were observed. The results indicate that the ski boot temperature was not affected by ski boots of low quality. It is recommended to reconsider the basic construction of liners in order to improve their moisture management. One possible improvement may be to construct the liner in a way that sweat and potentially melted snow are stored as far away as possible from the foot. In this case the outer layer of the liner should have a higher water uptake than the inner layer. In addition, highly hydrophobic sock materials should be selected in order to keep the socks dry and to avoid that the feet get wet...|$|R
