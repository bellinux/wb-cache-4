25|$|Pennsylvania {{departed}} Liverpool for Philadelphia at 2:30pm February 21, 1874, with {{a typical}} small winter-passage complement of two saloon and twelve steerage-class passengers, and some $250,000 of cargo. On {{the night of}} February 27, the ship ran into a hurricane on the open sea. Giant waves swept everything from the ship's decks and flooded the passenger saloon, while the ship struggled to retain headway. At around midnight, a mammoth wave <b>slammed</b> <b>down</b> upon the vessel, sweeping away all the lifeboats and liferafts, and breaking the foreboom and {{all four of the}} ship's forward hatches. Water began pouring into the holds, until they were about one quarter full. Tragically, the huge wave had also swept away the wheelhouse, the mate's house, and part of the wooden ship's bridge, taking with them the captain of the ship and four crew members, none of whom were ever seen again.|$|E
500|$|Hawley {{also brought}} his visual effects {{supervisor}} John Ross from Fargo. Ross coordinated multiple visual effects vendors for Legion, {{which he described}} as [...] "a bit of a crapshoot" [...] because artists were often not able {{to work on the}} same shot week-to-week. He noted that though [...] "hundreds of thousands of dollars" [...] was spent on major visual effect sequences for the show, [...] "we don’t dwell on that aspect. There’s a jeep that gets <b>slammed</b> <b>down</b> , which the characters hide behind before it gets flung back into the building, but we pan off it, just throwing it away, because the destruction isn’t the point of the scene." [...] He compared this mindset to M. Night Shyamalan's approach to superpowers in Unbreakable. When realizing characters' special abilities, Ross said it [...] "comes down to tying this fantastic beam coming out to somebody’s hand, and showing how it lights up a face and distorts the air as it travels across frame. We want it to look as much like a live interactive element as we can imagine it to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Flight tests {{proceeded}} fairly smoothly until 4May1978, when HB1001 {{was making}} its 36th flight. The aircraft pitched {{up just as}} it made contact with the ground which forced the pilot, Bill Park, to abort the landing and make a second attempt. The impact had however been so hard that the landing gear had become jammed in a semi-retracted position. Efforts to lower the gear were unsuccessful and Bill Park was forced to climb again, and eject when his fuel ran out. The aircraft was destroyed on impact {{in the vicinity of}} the Groom Lake facility. Park survived, but suffered a concussion, forcing him to retire from further test flights. Dyson, who was in the chase plane, recounted: [...] "Just before touchdown the airplane pitched up... It seemed it <b>slammed</b> <b>down</b> on the ground real hard... He [...] raised the gear on the go around, and when he tried to extend it on approach, only one of the mains and the nose wheel came down. All this time, gas was being consumed... I suggested he climb up to 10,000 feet for ejection... He started climbing, but the engine started flaming out, from the lack of fuel, so he ejected." ...|$|E

2500|$|A [...] "shock test" [...] was {{performed}} on the three materials by dropping a block of each approximately six feet onto the ground. [...] The block of ice shattered into many pieces. [...] The block of regular pykrete broke into two pieces, but did not shatter. [...] The block of pseudo-pykrete would not break, even when <b>slammed</b> <b>down</b> from the same height.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Niers was {{tortured}} and executed {{over the course}} of three days in September 1581. On the first day, strips of flesh were torn from his body and heated oil was poured into his wounds. [...] On the second day, his feet were smeared with heated oil and then held above glowing coal, thereby roasting him. On the third day, 16 September 1581, he was dragged to the place of execution and broken on the wheel; the wheel was <b>slammed</b> <b>down</b> upon him 42 times. Still alive, he was finally dismembered by quartering.|$|E
2500|$|The Nazis {{disguised}} their [...] "Final Solution" [...] as {{the mass}} [...] "resettlement to the east". The victims {{were told they}} were being taken to labour camps in Ukraine. In reality, from 1942 on for most Jews, deportations meant only death at either Bełżec, Chełmno, Sobibór, Majdanek, Treblinka, or Auschwitz-Birkenau. Some trains that had already transported goods to the Eastern front on their return carried human cargo bound for extermination camps. The plan was being realized in the utmost secrecy. In late 1942 during a telephone conversation Hitler's private secretary Martin Bormann admonished Heinrich Himmler who was informing him about 50,000 Jews already exterminated in a concentration camp in Poland. [...] "They were not exterminated – Bormann screamed – only evacuated, evacuated, evacuated!" [...] and <b>slammed</b> <b>down</b> the phone, wrote Enghelberg.|$|E

5000|$|While Chalker {{earned a}} {{reputation}} both as an innovator and performer, he was also known for his quick temper and strong personality. Sometimes after onstage mistakes, he {{had a tendency to}} <b>slam</b> <b>down</b> his fretting bar and yell profanities, a habit that led bandleader Hank Thompson to remark: ...|$|R
2500|$|... 30 July 1966: 60-6941 (Article 135), {{one of the}} two drone carriers, {{was lost}} during a test flight off the California coast. The pilot and launch control {{engineer}} ejected safely but the engineer drowned. Article 135 was operating 300 miles from the California coast to carry out a test launch of a D-21. The aircraft was flying at Mach 3.2+ when the crew made sure that the Marquardt engine on the D-21 had the required airflow. The drone was launched but the D-21 engine failed to start and it <b>slammed</b> <b>down</b> on the launch pylon causing the mother ship to pitch up. The pressure from the Mach-3.2 airflow [...] "ripped the fuselage forebody from the wing planform". The crew were unable to escape at this high speed but managed to eject as the forebody tumbled towards the sea. The pilot was picked up by helicopter from the sea but the LCO drowned.|$|E

50|$|The STO (Space Tornado Ogawa) is a sweep {{in which}} a wrestler wraps one arm across the chest of his/her {{opponent}} and sweeps the opponent's leg with his/her own leg to slam the other wrestler back-first. This {{can also be a}} lariat-legsweep combination to <b>slam</b> <b>down</b> the opponent. This is also a move used often in Judo and in other grappling martial arts. This maneuver can be used running and standing.|$|R
50|$|The wrestler {{approaches}} the opponent from behind, and lifts {{him on his}} shoulders into a seated position, the electric chair. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up by his thighs and pushes him forward and <b>down,</b> <b>slamming</b> him <b>down</b> to the mat chest first. The wrestler may also sit <b>down</b> while <b>slamming</b> the opponent.|$|R

60|$|No {{matter where}} he went, {{or what he}} did; no matter how thick the crowd about him, or how loud the din; still, like a {{relentless}} ghost, that mild old lady was ever at his side, mutely pointing and affably smiling. Of course he gave in, lifted one tray, saw much flannel, nearly blew his venerable nose off sniffing at one suspicious bottle, and <b>slamming</b> <b>down</b> the lid, scrawled a mysterious cross, bowed and fled.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' {{said the}} little one, 'you must remain at your post, but I shall {{give you a}} piece of good advice; you shall go up into the pulpit, and remain {{standing}} there. You need never mind what you see or hear, {{it will not be}} able to do you any harm, if you remain in your place until you hear the lid of the chest <b>slam</b> <b>down</b> again behind the dead; then all danger is past, and you can go about the church, wherever you please.' ...|$|R
60|$|Quitzow being settled,--for {{the country}} is in {{military}} occupation of Friedrich and his allies, and except in some stone castle a man has no chance,--straightway Putlitz or another mutineer, with his drawbridge up, was battered to pieces, and his drawbridge brought <b>slamming</b> <b>down.</b> After this manner, in an incredibly short period, mutiny was quenched; and it became apparent to Noble Lords, and to all men, that here at length was a man come who would have the Laws obeyed again, and could and would keep mutiny down.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Sherlock Holmes--" [...] I began, but {{the words}} had a most magical effect, for the window {{instantly}} <b>slammed</b> <b>down,</b> and within a minute the door was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man, with stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses.|$|E
6000|$|The {{aggressive}} captain {{lined the}} ball at Bo Stranathan. The Natchez shortstop had a fine opportunity to make the catch, but he made an inglorious muff. Tay Tay hurried to bat.

50|$|The {{vertical}} {{component of the}} vibration {{that could not be}} eliminated because of the weight needed to balance the pistons is called hammering. This is destructive to both the locomotive and the roadbed. In some locomotives, this hammering can be so intense that at speed, the drivers alternately jump from the rail head, then <b>slam</b> <b>down</b> hard on the rails as the wheels complete their rotation. Unfortunately, hammering is inherent to conventional two-cylinder piston-driven steam locomotives {{and that is one of}} the several reasons they have been retired from service.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Everything I'm Not" [...] {{music video}} {{featured}} The Veronicas singing with their band while trashing a car of an ex-boyfriend, apparently named Ryan, for cheating on Lisa by painting and smashing {{the car with}} paint buckets while the ex-boyfriend looked on from a video camera. When it's {{too much for the}} ex-boyfriend to handle, he drops his cell phone on the ground. In the end, it seems like the police catch them doing it and they <b>slam</b> <b>down</b> the camera, smashing the ex-boyfriend's chances of seeing his car for the final time.|$|R
5000|$|Much of {{the story}} and {{gameplay}} puts focus on the [...] "energy leash", a rope of energy projected from a device on Grayson's left hand. The leash allows him to pull enemies towards him, activate certain devices and traps, and <b>slam</b> <b>down</b> a ball of energy that launches all nearby enemies into the air. The player can also kick enemies or run and slide into them. If an enemy is launched into the air from the whip or by being kicked/slid into, he goes into slow motion, allowing players to perform skillshots.|$|R
