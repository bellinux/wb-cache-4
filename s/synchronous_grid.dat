In 2006, Québec's transmission system {{was recognized by}} the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as a full interconnection because it is asynchronous with neighboring systems. Québec will consequently {{be able to develop}} its own reliability standards, as needed, and these will apply in addition to the relevant North American standards. Besides the Quebec Interconnection, there are three other interconnections in North America: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—To {{support a}} high {{penetration}} of intermittent {{solar and wind}} power generation, many regions are planning to add new high capacity transmission lines. These additional transmis-sion lines strengthen grid synchronization, but will also increase the grid’s short circuit capacity, and furthermore will be very costly. With a highly interconnected grid and variable renewable generation, a small grid failure can easily start cascading out-ages, resulting in large scale blackout. We introduce the “digital grid, ” where large <b>synchronous</b> <b>grids</b> are divided into smaller segmented grids which are connected asynchronously, via multileg IP addressed ac/dc/ac converters called digital grid routers. These routers {{communicate with each other}} and send power among the segmented grids through existing transmission lines, which have been repurposed as digital grid transmission lines. The digital grid can accept high penetrations of renewable power, prevent cas-cading outages, accommodate identifiable tagged electricity flows, record those transactions, and trade electricity as a commodity.

40|$|AbstractWe {{provide a}} short {{notation}} for processes with parallel inputs and outputs. With this specification format <b>synchronous</b> networks or <b>grid</b> protocols {{can be specified}} in a straightforward way. For a certain class of connected networks we prove a correctness theorem that characterizes I/O behavior. We illustrate our approach by an example on the approximation of a one-dimensional wave equation...|$|R
5000|$|Denmark has two {{separated}} transmission systems, {{of which}} the eastern one is synchronous with Nordic (former NORDEL) and the western one with the <b>synchronous</b> <b>grid</b> of Continental Europe. The phases of the two systems are not synchronized, and can therefore only be connected via transformers and direct current.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variable-frequency}} transformer (VFT) is used {{to transmit}} electricity between two ( [...] or synchronous) alternating current frequency domains. The VFT is a relatively recent development. Most asynchronous grid inter-ties use high-voltage direct current converters, while <b>synchronous</b> <b>grid</b> inter-ties are connected by lines and [...] "ordinary" [...] transformers, but without {{the ability to control}} power flow between the systems.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} a [...] "Super Grid" [...] is not new- the term itself was used to {{describe}} the emerging unification of the Great Britain grid in the 60s.Europe has been unifying its grids since the 1950s and its largest unified grid is the <b>synchronous</b> <b>grid</b> of Continental Europe serving 24 countries. There are studies and ongoing discussions regarding creation of a <b>synchronous</b> <b>grid</b> spanning 13 time zones that would result from unifying the UCTE grid with that of the IPS/UPS Interconnection serving Russia, Ukraine and other countries of the former Soviet Union.Such mega systems are experiencing scaling problems as a result of network complexity, transmission congestion, and the need for rapid diagnostic, coordination and control systems.Advocates of schemes such as the SuperSmart Grid claim that such a major technological upgrade is necessary to assure the practical operation and promised benefits of such transcontinental mega grids.|$|E
50|$|The National Electricity Market (NEM) is the Australian {{wholesale}} electricity {{market that}} covers the electrically connected states and territories of eastern and southern Australia, and the associated <b>synchronous</b> electricity transmission <b>grid.</b> The Australian Energy Market Commission develops and maintains the Australian National Electricity Rules, which have the force of law for the NEM in the participating states and territories. The Rules are enforced by the Australian Energy Regulator.|$|R
50|$|On 31 December 2013, the Northern, Eastern and Western grids were {{synchronised}} {{with the}} Southern regional grid, creating a single <b>synchronous</b> AC <b>grid</b> {{over the whole}} of India. As a result, the converter station is no longer required for its original purpose of asynchronously linking the Eastern and Southern grids, although it can still {{be used as an}} embedded power flow device to help control power flow within the AC system. The stations could potentially be dismantled and moved to elsewhere to export/import power from other countries. Sometimes the excess power fed to the southern grid by this HVDC link is flowing back to Western region through the 765 KV AC lines between Southern grid and the Western grid which is not desired.|$|R
50|$|The {{frequency}} (F) of a {{synchronous generator}} is {{directly proportional to}} its speed (N). When multiple synchronous generators are connected in parallel to electrical grid, the frequency is fixed by the grid, since individual power output of each generator will be small compared to the load on a large <b>grid.</b> <b>Synchronous</b> generators connected to the grid run at various speeds but they all run at the same frequency because they differ {{in the number of}} poles (P).|$|R
50|$|High-voltage {{direct current}} lines or {{variable-frequency}} transformers {{can be used}} to connect two alternating current interconnection networks which are not necessarily synchronized with each other. This provides the benefit of interconnection without the need to synchronize an even wider area. For example, compare the wide area <b>synchronous</b> <b>grid</b> map of Europe (above left) with the map of HVDC lines (below right).|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} {{to build this}} powerline was made in 1977 and it went in operation in 1985. [...] The line went out of service after Poland joined the <b>synchronous</b> <b>grid</b> of Continental Europe (UCTE). [...] However, there was a plan to re-activate this line after 2010 by constructing a back-to-back conversion station on the Polish end of the line, {{but this was not}} implemented.|$|E
5000|$|The power {{stations}} has installed capacity of 2,520 MW. It {{is fueled by}} natural gas, fuel oil and coal. [...] In November 2008, Inter RAO UES and Moldelectrica signed an agreement to separate some power units in the power station from the IPS/UPS system and synchronize them with the <b>synchronous</b> <b>grid</b> of Continental Europe in Romania through the 400 kV Kuchurgan-Vulcăneşti and Vulcăneşti-Isaccea transmission lines.|$|E
30|$|Other {{areas in}} the figure are worth note. Denmark reached 42 % {{penetration}} of VRE, Germany 20 %, and California 14 % in 2015, but these areas are parts of larger <b>synchronous</b> AC <b>grids</b> and can ship excess power from VRE to neighboring regions and rely on the overall system for stability support. Larger synchronous AC systems, such as the Western Interconnection of the United States that is coordinated for reliability by the Western Electrical Coordinating Council (WECC) are only around 14 % wind and solar by capacity and 9 % by annual energy [34]. The WECC power system has a peak demand of approximately 150  GW. Studies have been conducted to examine the impacts of high levels of VRE in the WECC [35]. These {{studies have shown that}} 35 % on an annual basis and 65 % on an instantaneous basis are technically possible.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of <b>synchronous</b> generators to <b>grid</b> voltage unbalance and grid faults. A Model of a synchronous generator with a full converter is implemented in the SimPowerSystems toolbox in Matlab/Simulink. Methods to modify the converter control schemes to improve the synchronous generator systems response to grid voltage unbalance and grid faults are investigated. Grid faults including grid voltage unbalance, and line-to-ground faults are introduced into the model at specific times to analyse {{the performance of}} the wind generation system. Improvements in {{the performance of the}} synchronous generator WECS to the grid disturbances are illustrated...|$|R
30|$|The smaller {{systems are}} true <b>synchronous</b> AC <b>grids</b> with ultra-high levels of renewables. These are mostly very small systems under 1  MW of {{installed}} capacity that {{are located in}} remote areas and island power systems. At the very small {{end of the spectrum}} are island like Ta’u in America Samoa located in the South Pacific. This island recently replaced its diesel generators with a 1.4  MW PV system and 6  MWh battery system [25]. The average load is only around 80  kW. The reason that the installed capacity for the PV and battery is so much higher than the average load is because the system must be sized to fully meet its energy needs with only solar energy and the capacity factor for solar even in the best locations is around 20 %. So to produce enough power for 24 -h operations a PV system would need to be sized at least 5 times larger than the load on a daily basis. The PV and energy storage must also be designed to provide several days of power when there is no sun.|$|R
