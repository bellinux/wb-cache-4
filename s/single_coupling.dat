500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the UK in December 1972, with a special offer price of £3.10, {{the same as a}} typical single LP from that period. It reached number 16 in the charts. The cover was designed by Glover and featured a colour photo of the band on the front and rear covers, and black and white photos in the inside gatefold. The release in the US was delayed until April 1973, because Warner Bros. wanted to release Who Do We Think We Are first. They were motivated into releasing it due to a steady flow of UK imports being purchased, and it was an immediate commercial success, reaching number 6 in the charts. Warner Brothers also released [...] "Smoke on the Water" [...] as a <b>single,</b> <b>coupling</b> the live recording on Made in Japan with the studio version on Machine Head, and it reached number 4 in the Billboard charts. A recording of [...] "Black Night" [...] from the Tokyo gig, one of the encores that was not on the album, was released as the B-side to the single [...] "Woman from Tokyo" [...] in Europe, and as a single in its own right in Japan.|$|E

The band also issued a greatest hits compilation in late 1979 Greatest Hits 1972–1978, and released a <b>single,</b> <b>coupling</b> [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] with [...] "For You and I", which failed to chart.|$|E
50|$|Because proton decay {{involves}} violating both lepton and baryon number simultaneously, {{no single}} renormalizable R-parity violating coupling leads to proton decay. This has motivated {{the study of}} R-parity violation where only one set of the R-parity violating couplings are non-zero which is sometimes called the <b>single</b> <b>coupling</b> dominance hypothesis.|$|E

50|$|Soon after {{entering}} service, problems were experienced with failing connecting rods, big end bearings breaking {{up as well}} as cracks developing in the motion girder of the Alligator crossheads. After investigations by SAR engineers with assistance from the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the crossheads, slide bars and coupling rods were modified. The crossheads were converted to the multiple-bearing type with single guide bars while the three independent coupling rods were replaced with the more conventional <b>single</b> <b>coupling</b> rod with knuckle joints.|$|E
5000|$|Available as a four-door sedan, with a {{traditional}} Panhard layout, the A20 Colt 1000 was powered by a 977 cc engine producing [...] at 6,000 rpm. The Colt 1000 was introduced in July 1963. Top speed was 125 km/h. Traditional throughout, the Colt 1000 also had a column shifter for its (fully synchronized) four-speed manual transmission. In December 1965, a 3-speed semi-automatic transmission was also added, unfortunately named SCAT (<b>Single</b> <b>Coupling</b> Automatic Transmission). Top speed remained the same. Standard and DeLuxe models were available, for the Van {{as well as for}} the sedan.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{release of}} the session was on 19 March 1971 in the US by Decca Records, {{as well as a}} <b>single</b> <b>coupling</b> the tracks [...] "My Baby Left Me" [...] and [...] "Lovin' You Is Good For Me, Baby" [...] (Decca 32831.) It was issued in the UK by MCA Records in March 1972 after Lawrence played some tracks to company {{president}} Mike Maitland. However, Maitland had left the company by the time the LP was released, so it was not promoted and was not commercially successful.|$|E

5000|$|The group next {{released}} a <b>single</b> <b>coupling</b> [...] "Alone in Georgia" [...] and [...] "Can Anybody Hear Me?" [...] on Vertigo in the UK and by Phillips in Germany. The second album followed, and Coopman on the Progressive Rock Archives website, in 2000, again cited [...] "Tapestry of Delights" [...] when he observed: [...] "Much better is the surprisingly rare second album for Vertigo, (A Ballad of) A Peaceful Man. The solos are tighter and more controlled and the compositions are better. It is also less bluesy, very crisply produced and features good multi-part singing, greatly enriching their textures".|$|E

After investigations by SAR engineers with assistance from South Africa's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the crossheads, slide bars and coupling rods were modified. The crossheads were converted to the multiple-bearing type with single guide bars, a more sophisticated method of filtering out the cylinder and valve lubricant from the exhaust steam replaced the original centrifuge while the three independent coupling rods were replaced with the more conventional <b>single</b> <b>coupling</b> rod with knuckle joints.|$|E
5000|$|Rechristened Leviathan, Elektra {{launched}} their recording career in April 1969, with the simultaneous issue of two singles. Three of the chosen tracks - [...] "Remember The Times", [...] "Second Production" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] had been initially been conceived as Span recordings, {{and the newly}} composed [...] "The War Machine" [...] completed the quartet. Elektra's media campaign was titled 'The Four Faces of Leviathan'. Despite the commercial failure of both singles, work continued on the band's album at Trident Studios. As a taster for the LP, a further <b>single</b> <b>coupling</b> [...] "Flames" [...] and [...] "Just Forget Tomorrow" [...] was recorded in the summer. By {{the time that it}} surfaced in October 1969, however, Leviathan had split up. Holzman stated dissatisfication with the album, and Bennett, who had returned to the band part-time, felt that he could earn more as a building site labourer.|$|E

5000|$|In 1971 the band's self-titled {{album was}} {{released}} on Triangle Records, with all the tracks on the LP having been written by Souffreau and Van Der Schueren. In September 1971, a <b>single</b> <b>coupling</b> the songs [...] "Carry On" [...] and [...] "Child" [...] was released, again on Triangle Records, and these songs were later added as bonus tracks to the 1992 reissue of the Irish Coffee album on the Voodoo label. The band went on to play so many concerts that Hugo Verhoye decided to leave, and he was replaced by Raf Lenssens before the song [...] "Down Down Down" [...] was released as a single {{at the end of}} the year. In the spring of 1973, Jean Van Der Schueren left the band to continue his classical guitar studies, and he was replaced by Luc De Clus, who had been playing guitar since the age of five. [...] In June 1974, [...] "Witchy Lady" [...] (b/w [...] "I'm Hers") {{was released on}} the Barclay Records label and received quite a large amount of radio airplay but unfortunately failed to reach the charts.|$|E
