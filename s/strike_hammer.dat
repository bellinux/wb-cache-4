50|$|Until 2011, {{the bells}} hung in a steel yoke. In {{the course of}} the cathedral renovations of 2011/2, this yoke was {{replaced}} with a new oak wood yoke, intended to produce a softer ring. The new yoke consists of 24 m3 of wood and its load-redistributing substructure weighs 6 tonnes. In addition, the electrical system was renovated: the motor was replaced and each bell was equipped with its own electronically-operated <b>strike</b> <b>hammer.</b>|$|E
40|$|Clapper Tongue and Moon Walker {{were created}} from {{research}} on the coastline fortifications at Berwick-upon-Tweed during the Berwick Gymnasium Fellowship (October 2008 -March 2009) funded by Arts Council England and English Heritage. Clapper Tongue is a 45 -kg bronze life cast head and shoulders {{in the form of}} a bell suspended from the ceiling, fitted with an electronic <b>strike</b> <b>hammer,</b> ringing on an hourly timer. Cobbing liaised with the Whitechapel Bell Foundry to establish the optimum high copper bronze alloy to achieve a resonant sound for the bell-like sculpture, to account for its unusual non-symmetrical shape. Clapper Tongue also referenced the warning bell tower that was tolled when enemy lines approached the town, part of the area’s broader defensive architecture, from artillery ramparts built in 1558 to WWII concrete pillboxes. The title ‘Clapper Tongue’ refers to the anatomy and anthropomorphism of bronze bells, parts of which are labelled ‘neck’, ‘lip’, ‘shoulder’, and ‘clapper tongue. ’ Moon Walker (13 : 15 mins) is a video documenting Cobbing walking backwards in a circle besides the Berwick coastline, with footage reversed so that he appeared to be walking forwards into his footprints in the sand. The performative action engages with Roberts Smithson’s theorization of entropy in ‘Monuments of Passaic’ (1967); namely how earthly material is subject to an irreversible process of erosion and dispersal. The erasure of a ‘drawn’ line of footprints along the coast in the Moon Walker video also echoes the palimpsest of shifting borderlines between England and Scotland in Berwick...|$|E

25|$|Operation Black Lion (15 June – 19 October 1972) was a Royal Lao Government counter-offensive {{against a}} People's Army of Vietnam thrust that cut the Kingdom of Laos in two at Khong Sedone during May 1972. Two regiments of Royalist {{military}} irregulars retaliated on 15 June 1972, attacking the Communist 39th Regiment {{in an air}} assault while Royal Lao Air Force tactical air <b>strikes</b> <b>hammered</b> the 39th. During the next month, the 39th Regiment would suffer an estimated 360 casualties and be rendered ineffective for attacks. On 18 July, they retreated, leaving a rear guard to be overrun.|$|R
5000|$|Americus's {{innovation}} was {{the addition}} of an [...] "escapement" [...] to Silbermann's realization of a string striking action design. Unlike Cristofori's design (to which of course Americus had no access) which interposed an intermediate lever between the lever that the key lifts and the <b>striking</b> <b>hammer,</b> Americus placed an upstanding wooden [...] "jack" [...] pivoting from this lever acting directly on a leather clothed notch in the hammer butt. An adjustable screw mounted underneath the hammer flange support rail, known as a [...] "set-off", impacts upon the jack, disengaging it from the hammer which is thus launched into free flight before it strikes its course of strings.|$|R

50|$|Shorinji Kempo {{incorporates}} zen {{for mental}} training. Techniques are mainly divided into 3 categories: gōhō (剛法 hard techniques - hand <b>strikes,</b> chops, <b>hammers,</b> elbows, knees, kicks, reaps, stomps, and blocks); jūhō (柔法 soft techniques - throws, pins, chokes, joint manipulations, dodges and releases) and; seihō (整法 healing techniques - acupressure, bone setting, and resuscitation techniques).|$|R
50|$|The {{permanent}} {{magnetic field}} holds the hammer spring in stressed, ready to strike position. The driver sends electric current to hammer coil, which then creates electromagnetic field opposite to the permanent magnetic field. When both fields equalize, the energy {{stored in the}} spring is released to <b>strike</b> the <b>hammer</b> against the ribbon and prints a dot on the paper.|$|R

50|$|On small upright pianos, {{the soft}} pedal moves the hammers {{closer to the}} strings. On grand pianos, the soft pedal moves the hammers {{sideways}} so each <b>hammer</b> <b>strikes</b> only part of its string group.|$|R
50|$|They are {{triggered}} by pressure rather than impact. This makes them safe during transport, as they normally cannot detonate {{in a bag}} or storage container. Detonating them by <b>striking</b> with a <b>hammer</b> does work.|$|R
50|$|It {{requires}} {{only one person}} to operate. Each hammer is connected by a rope to a fixed frame in the bell-ringing room. When in use the ropes are taut, and pulling one of the ropes towards the player will <b>strike</b> the <b>hammer</b> against the bell. To enable normal full circle ringing on the same bells, the ropes are slackened to allow the hammers to drop away from the moving bells.|$|R

50|$|A variant on the Marxophone idea is the marxoguitar or guitar-marxophone, {{created by}} Ranjit Bhatnagar. In 2010 {{he made a}} six-hammer device that could be {{attached}} to an electric guitar at the bridge, creating a Marxophone-like repeated <b>hammer</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{planishing}} hammers {{are generally}} {{in contact with}} the outside surface of the piece, they are flat, have rounded edges and are polished to avoid marring the work. Pneumatic (air powered) planishing <b>hammers</b> <b>strike</b> hundreds of blows per minute.|$|R
50|$|Another type, the single-stroke bell, has no {{interrupting}} contacts. The <b>hammer</b> <b>strikes</b> the gong once {{each time}} the circuit is closed. These are used to signal brief notifications, such as a shop door opening for a customer, rather than continuous warnings.|$|R
50|$|The Dulcitone has {{a similar}} sound to the {{glockenspiel}} since its sound is made by <b>hammers</b> <b>striking</b> tuning forks. The dulcitone uses soft hammers which damp the forks, compared to the hard hammers of the glockenspiel, creating a more gentle sound.|$|R
50|$|The {{blacksmith}} lapwing or {{blacksmith plover}} (Vanellus armatus) occurs commonly from Kenya through central Tanzania to southern and southwestern Africa.

50|$|Closing {{a circuit}} to render a device {{operational}} might also violate the Biblical prohibition of makeh bapatish (<b>striking</b> the final <b>hammer</b> blow, i.e. completing a product).

This concept was later abandoned.|$|R
40|$|This study delves {{into the}} history of the presentations and transformations of John Massey’s As the <b>Hammer</b> <b>Strikes</b> (A Partial Illustration) (1982) and Douglas Gordon’s Play Dead; Real Time (2003). John Massey’s As the <b>Hammer</b> <b>Strikes</b> (A Partial Illustration) was {{initially}} presented as three synchronised 16 mm film projections. Its presentation format was migrated twice and from a film installation it became a video installation. Douglas Gordon’s Play Dead; Real Time was first exhibited as a three-channel video installation (two screens and one monitor). In some recent exhibitions, depending on the space allowed and the configuration of the room, the artist has chosen to add a second monitor, meaning that the work temporarily became a four-channel video installation. In this paper, I explore how the re-exhibitions of these two artworks have challenged their authenticity...|$|R
25|$|Because {{one of its}} {{decomposition}} {{products is}} a gas, S4N4 {{can be used as}} an explosive. Purer samples tend to be more explosive.
