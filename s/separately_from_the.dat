5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the courtroom, and women may have been excluded.

If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat <b>separately</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> men.|$|E
