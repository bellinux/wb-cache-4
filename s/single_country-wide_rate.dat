In the Laos Government’s <b>country-wide</b> <b>rating</b> of district development levels, these two districts {{rank among the}} poorest districts {{as measured by the}} national poverty index and suffer some of the highest UXO accident rates. The UXO problem in Laos will be solved through accurate survey, correct clearance prioritisation and, most importantly, the implementation of large-scale clearance. Regionally HALO has over 1,000 local staff in both Sri Lanka and Cambodia and almost 4,000 in Afghanistan conducting such clearance operations. The Government of Laos requires this scale of clearance if Millennium Development Goal 9 (reduce the impact of UXO) is to be met.|$|R
50|$|The {{system of}} multi-member {{constituencies}} {{has been criticized}} {{over the years by}} many politicians, who claim that it is easy for the government to gerrymander the boundaries. The Baabda-Aley constituency, established for the 2000 election, is a case in point: the predominantly Druze area of Aley (in the east of Beirut) were combined, in a single constituency, with the predominantly Christian area of Baabda. The same thing happens in the South, meaning that although several seats within the constituency are allocated to Christians, they have to appeal to an electorate which is predominantly Muslim. Many opposition politicians, mostly Christians, have claimed that the constituency boundaries were extensively gerrymandered in the elections of 1992, 1996, 2000, 2005 and 2009. There have also been calls {{for the creation of a}} <b>single,</b> <b>country-wide</b> constituency.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{estimate}} time {{trends in}} the recourse to radical prostatectomy (RP) and associated short-term outcomes after RP in Italy, as population-based data on RP adoption and outcomes are available mainly from Northern America and Northern Europe. Patients and Methods All RPs for prostate cancer performed between 2001 and 2010 were extracted from the Italian national archive of hospital discharge records. Age-specific and age-standardised RP rates were computed. The effect of procedural volume on in-hospital mortality, complications, and length of stay (LOS) was estimated by multilevel regression models. Results In all, 144 432 RPs were analysed. <b>Country-wide</b> RP <b>rates</b> increased between 2001 and 2004, and thereafter remained stable, with large differences between geographical areas. The mean hospital volume increased in the first study years, without centralisation but due to increasing RP numbers at the population level. The median LOS declined from 10 to 8 days over the study period (mean from 11. 7 to 9. 2 days). In-hospital mortality declined from 0. 16...|$|R

Thus 1943 became the year of lowest rates in the history of malaria in this country. Although malaria appears to be of decreasing importance as a public health problem in this country there are two reasons why malaria control operations must still be carried on: 1) Malaria is traditionally an endemic disease in the Southeastern States which as a unit show mortality and morbidity rates of 2 to 3 times the rates for the country; and 2) The cyclic character exhibited by the epidemic curve of malaria suggests that in spite of the consistent downward trend of the last ten years the time may yet come when the disease will sharply increase in another cycle. Carriers returning from abroad after service with the armed forces may provide the impetus which will give rise to another upswing in the epidemic curve. For these reasons considerable emphasis is being given by the Office of Malaria Control in War Areas toward maintaining efforts directed at decreasing the hazard from malaria in the endemic areas of the Southeast. In considering choice of areas for control operations it has been the policy of MCWA to concentrate on the most important counties as determined by death rates. It is generally considered that reporting of deaths due to malaria is more reliable than the reporting of eases, although glaring examples of the respective faults of either are not difficult to demonstrate...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{builds a}} general oligopolistic {{equilibrium}} model to investigate how within-sector firm heterogeneities affect wage <b>rate,</b> <b>country-wide</b> profits, and welfare. Using linear inverse demands, I consider asymmetric sectors, each involving n Cournot oligopolists producing horizontally differentiated varieties with constant, though asymmetric, costs. I link {{a measure of}} the average within-sector firm heterogeneity with the economy-wide, endogenously determined, and competitive wage rate. For interior equilibriums, the higher the "average" the lower the wage rate. Once general equilibrium feedbacks from wage rate are considered, the "average" has an unclear impact on country-wide profits and welfare, depending on moments of the technology distribution as well as demand parameters. The findings have implications to better understand antitrust and related policies. ...|$|R
40|$|The soil-transmitted nematode, Strongyloides stercoralis {{is one of}} the most-{{neglected}} of all neglected tropical diseases. It is globally distributed, favouring the humid, wet climates of {{the tropics}} and subtropics. Inadequate sanitary conditions promote the spread of S. stercoralis infection. In South-East Asia, many countries provide the ideal ecological and economic setting for high S. stercoralis infection rates. Yet, in most of these countries, {{little is known about the}} actual prevalence and distribution of S. stercoralis. One reason for this lack of knowledge pertains to the time- and resource-intensive diagnostic methods used to detect S. stercoralis infection. The Koga Agar culture method and the Baermann method are considered to be the best coprological diagnostic methods for field settings today. Both detect the parasite with high sensitivity. This sensitivity can be increased further by examining stool samples for several consecutive days, thereby increasing the chances of detecting low-intensity chronic infections. Diagnostic challenges, however, lead to the omission of S. stercoralis in studies of soil-transmitted helminths and few studies focus on S. stercoralis, specifically. These factors lead to an underreporting of the nematode's prevalence, not only in South-East Asia but worldwide. We have reviewed the scientific literature of the last 25 years and estimated <b>country-wide</b> prevalence <b>rates</b> for South-East Asia. We aim to summarise what is known today about the prevalence of S. stercoralis in South-East Asia, as well as to ascertain the risk factors and diagnostic methods most commonly applied...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on ethnographic field {{research}} undertaken in a public health clinic in the periphery of São Paulo, {{as well as an}} examination of the "Humanisation of Childbirth Campaign". The Humanisation Campaign is a Brazilian public health initiative targeted at low-income women that aims to drastically lower <b>country-wide</b> caesarean <b>rates.</b> This paper will consider how pregnant women actively seek to be labeled 'at risk' during ante-natal care by doctors, nurses and health care technicians in order to ensure access to caesarean technology during their birthing process, {{in order to avoid the}} discrimination and physical abuse often associated with a vaginal delivery. I suggest that experiences of riscos, or riskiness, bear heavily on women's pragmatic adoption of interventionist birthing. Riscos, as it has been explained to me, is experienced both bodily and socially, as a physical threat to bodies that is experienced via physical and social violence within the clinic. In this paper, I plan to explore the phenomenology of risk, and how, for women from the periphery, risk to body and health is an embodied experience, and situated within the social and political context within which individual experience occurs. Ethnographic work suggests that women seek inclusion into 'expert' biomedical risk assessments and categories that ordinarily exclude or overlook them. This paper will be situated in an examination of the Humanisation of Birth Campaign, it will explore the conflicting meanings about what 'natural, normal and tradtional' means in Brazil, and the ongoing debate over birthing that is currently encapsulated in the narratives surrounding the Humanisation Campaign. (cont.) This pragmatic desire to adopt risk labels offers a window into understanding a new range of questions about how public health narratives have direct implications for women's reproductive health, while at the same time reconfigure women's conceptions of, and negotiations with, bodily risk and flexibility. by Laurie Michelle Denyer.

40|$|This paper proposes {{measures}} {{to quantify the}} effective level and the effective progressivity of taxation in a fiscally decentralized country taking income sorting into account. Using data on the universe of Swiss taxpayers, we find that rich households effectively face significantly lower average and marginal tax rates and lower progressivity than in the benchmark case that does not consider income sorting. This is because high-income households systematically avoid high taxation by locating in low-tax jurisdictions. The results are stronger for singles than for families, indicating that singles are more sensitive to spatial tax differentials than families. Although income tax schedules of the Swiss federation, the 26 cantons and the more than 2, 600 municipalities are all strictly progressive, the effectively paid <b>country-wide</b> average tax <b>rate</b> is regressive for households with very high incomes and without children. The proposed measure of the effective average and marginal tax rates also allows us to adequately describe {{the evolution of the}} country-wide tax burden over time. We document that about half of the reduction in the tax burden on top incomes between 1975 and 2009 is due to reductions in statutory tax rates and about half to stronger income sorting of the population. Our results also hold when we account for the disutility from housing prices into which tax rates capitalize...|$|R
