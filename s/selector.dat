5|$|Brown was a Queensland <b>selector</b> from 1950–51 to 1959–60, and an Australian <b>selector</b> in 1952–53 after {{defeating}} New South Wales' Chappie Dwyer in an election. He was {{the first}} Queenslander in 23 years {{to serve as a}} national <b>selector.</b> His brief tenure as a national <b>selector</b> was marked by abuse and harassment from parochial Queenslanders, upset that he did not include his fellow statesmen in the Test team. Brown's sports store was vandalised and he resigned as a <b>selector</b> within a year. In 1992, Brown was elected a life member of the Queensland Cricket Association, and in 2000 was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for his services to cricket.|$|E
5|$|Gallaher {{retired from}} playing after the All Blacks' tour, but {{remained}} {{involved in the}} sport as a coach and <b>selector.</b> He coached at age group level for Ponsonby and in 1906 succeeded Fred Murray as sole <b>selector</b> of the Auckland provincial team. He was Auckland <b>selector</b> until 1916; over this time Auckland played 65 games, won 48, lost 11 and drew 6. Gallaher did make a brief comeback as a playertravelling as the <b>selector</b> of an injury depleted Auckland team, he turned out against Marlborough at Blenheim in 1909; Marlborough won 8–3. He also played against the Maniapoto sub-union just over a week later. Auckland held the Ranfurly Shield from 1905 to 1913, successfully defending it 23 times. The team struggled to retain the shield during 1912 and 1913 and eventually lost it to Taranaki in a 14–11 defeat. During Gallaher's tenure as <b>selector</b> Auckland inflicted a 11–0 defeat of the touring 1908 Anglo-Welsh side, defeated the New Zealand Māori in 1910, and beat Australia 15–11 in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Gallaher {{was also}} a {{national}} <b>selector</b> from 1907 to 1914, and with George Nicholson co-coached the All Blacks against the 1908 Anglo-Welsh team. A number of Gallaher's team-mates from the 1905–06 tour {{were included in the}} New Zealand squad for the series; of three Tests, the All Blacks won two and drew the other. During Gallaher's incumbency as a national <b>selector,</b> New Zealand played 50 matches, won 44, lost four and drew two. This included 16 Tests, of which only one was lost and two drawn.|$|E
30|$|As an extension of [22, 30], {{apart from}} simple <b>selectors,</b> we propose to use also a new kind of <b>selectors,</b> called {{extended}} <b>selectors,</b> which are created from available <b>selectors</b> (the current simple <b>selectors</b> and extended <b>selectors)</b> for splitting blocks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Selectors</b> were of two types: village <b>selectors</b> {{and free}} <b>selectors.</b> Village <b>selectors</b> were {{expected}} to live on their selections and could work on the roads. Free <b>selectors</b> were unable {{to work on the}} roads, but could keep their existing jobs and work the land. South Sassafras (Kallista) was open to free <b>selectors.</b>|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{we present}} three {{examples}} to illustrate Algorithm  1. Example  5 uses only basic <b>selectors,</b> Example  6 uses only simple <b>selectors,</b> and Example  7 uses both simple <b>selectors</b> and extended <b>selectors</b> for the granulation process. The {{aim is to}} show the effectiveness {{of different kinds of}} <b>selectors.</b>|$|R
5|$|He was an Australian <b>selector</b> from 1967 to 1979. Immediately {{after his}} appointment, he was embroiled in {{controversy}} during the First Test against India at Brisbane in 1967–68. The Queensland Cricket Association {{wrote to the}} board, complaining that Harvey, who was the <b>selector</b> on duty at the Test, had missed two hours of play. He had been at a race meeting {{at the invitation of}} the QCA president. The ACB gave Harvey a talking to. Despite this, he retained his position at the next annual election, with Queensland's Ken Mackay failing to gain a seat on the selection panel.|$|E
5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control <b>selector,</b> {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire <b>selector</b> provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E
5|$|Ahsan had {{conflicts}} with former Pakistan captain Javed Burki. A controversy regarding his bowling action {{resulted in the}} premature end of his international career {{when he was only}} 23. He worked as chief <b>selector,</b> team manager of Pakistan, and member of the 1987 Cricket World Cup organising committee. He died in Karachi on 8 March 2013, aged 73.|$|E

30|$|Apart {{from simple}} <b>selectors,</b> we {{introduced}} and used extended <b>selectors</b> for our method. We used information gain to choose blocks and <b>selectors</b> for granulating partitions. We also proposed a normal form {{which is used}} to represent concepts in a unified way. By Example  7, we showed that using both simple <b>selectors</b> and extended <b>selectors</b> is more effective than using only simple <b>selectors.</b> We have also implemented our method for a number of DLs.|$|R
30|$|We now {{describe}} a bisimulation-based concept learning method for information systems in DLs via Algorithm  1. It {{is based on}} the general method of [22]. In this algorithm, the kinds of <b>selectors</b> applied in the granulation process depend on Steps  2 and  19. We can use only basic <b>selectors,</b> only simple <b>selectors</b> or both of simple <b>selectors</b> and extended <b>selectors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Canavan was {{appointed}} manager of Fermanagh in November 2011 on a three-year term {{to be reviewed}} annually, with trainer Kieran Donnelly and <b>selector</b> Enda Kilpatrick joining him. His first game against Antrim, saw Fermanagh winning by a scoreline of 2 – 11 to 1 – 06.|$|E
5|$|In retirement, Brown briefly {{served as}} a Test <b>selector</b> and sold cars and, later, sports goods. In 2000, {{he was awarded the}} Medal of the Order of Australia for his {{services}} to cricket. At {{the time of his death}} in 2008, he was Australia's oldest Test cricketer.|$|E
5|$|In retirement, Davidson {{served on}} the boards of various organisations across fields as varying as charity, medicine, {{industry}} and sport. He was a national cricket <b>selector</b> for five years and was the President of the New South Wales Cricket Association from 1970 to 2003.|$|E
3000|$|Let D be {{a set of}} {{available}} <b>selectors</b> (at the beginning, D= ∅). At each step in the granulation process, <b>selectors</b> are created and added into D. Together with the current partition Y, we have D= {D_ 1, D_ 2, [...]..., D_h}, called the current set of <b>selectors.</b> Extended <b>selectors</b> are defined using the current set of <b>selectors</b> and object roles of the sublanguage as follows.|$|R
5000|$|Later {{variants}} (MP9-N, MP45) {{have new}} designed ambidextrous three-position <b>selectors.</b> The old Steyr style cross-bolt push button <b>selectors</b> are replaced with new [...] "HK" [...] style <b>selectors.</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{tested the}} method using simple <b>selectors</b> and {{extended}} <b>selectors</b> for different datasets. Our experimental {{results show that}} the method is valuable and extended <b>selectors</b> support it significantly.|$|R

5|$|Macartney's {{omission}} {{was part}} of the most infamous disputes in Australian cricket history and led to a fracas. Australian captain and <b>selector</b> Clem Hill wanted to include Macartney for the Third Test, but another member of the panel, former player Peter McAlister objected and said that Hill should omit himself if he wanted Macartney to play. Tensions between the two selectors were high, and came to a head in a selection meeting ahead of the Fourth Test. McAlister criticised Hill's tactics and policies towards his bowlers, provoking an exchange of insults regarding the other's leadership ability. Hill then bloodied McAlister with a powerful blow to the nose and the ensuing brawl lasted between 10 and 20 minutes. Furniture was knocked across the room, artwork shattered and Hill had to be restrained from throwing McAlister out of the third floor window, before resigning as a <b>selector.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{delivering}} the Oliver Plunkett trophy {{back to the}} Cavan town club, he {{then went on to}} become a <b>selector</b> with the Tyrone under 21 panel in 2015. He was part of the management team which consisted of Fergal Logan (Manager) and Brian Dooher. They guided the under 21s to an Ulster Final victory against Donegal in Celtic Park, and subsequently, to the All Ireland title, defeating Tipperary in the final.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{relations}} between classification and competition, using the theoretical framework of selection system theory. In a particular competitive arena more than one classification system can be in use. The proportion of classification systems in use by consumers that are also in use by the dominant <b>selectors</b> is a determinant of the risks of category spanning and radical innovation. Furthermore, these risks can be better understood by taking into account whether the selection system has different stages occupied by <b>selectors</b> of different types and {{by looking at the}} relations between the <b>selectors</b> of the primary market and the <b>selectors</b> of these <b>selectors.</b> Highlights ► Selection system theory serves to clarify the relation between classification and competition. ► In one particular competitive arena more than one classification system can be in use.

5|$|Although {{he disliked}} committees, Hutton {{served as an}} England Test <b>selector</b> in 1975 and 1976, but {{business}} commitments limited his availability so he resigned in 1977. Hutton became involved with Surrey cricket in later years but maintained links with Yorkshire, and became president of Yorkshire county cricket in January 1990. In his final years, Hutton suffered from ill health and became increasingly frail. In September 1990, he suffered a ruptured aorta shortly after watching a cricket match at the Oval. After an unsuccessful operation, he died on 6 September.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{defeated}} South Africa 4–0 {{and senior}} {{players such as}} Bill O'Reilly were pointed in their comments about the enjoyment of playing under Richardson's captaincy. A group of players who were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour. For some, the prospect of playing under Bradman was daunting, as was the knowledge that he would additionally be sitting in judgement of their abilities {{in his role as}} a <b>selector.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{the tour}} with a duck, Kippax {{recovered}} with 89 at Leicester before contracting a {{heavy dose of}} influenza that forced him to miss the next four matches. On his return, he struggled for form, and was not chosen for the first Test. Kippax was the third <b>selector</b> on tour, and was out-voted by his fellow selectors, so the press speculated that the decision caused disharmony within the team. Australia won the game and Kippax failed in the next two tour matches, so he missed out on the next Test at Lord's, which was lost.|$|E
30|$|This example {{demonstrates}} that using both simple <b>selectors</b> and extended <b>selectors</b> {{is better than}} using only simple <b>selectors.</b> The former reduces the number of iterations of the main loop {{and the length of}} the resulting concept.|$|R
30|$|We have {{implemented}} the bisimulation-based method using the mentioned <b>selectors</b> and information gain measures for concept learning in DLs w.r.t. Setting  3. The {{aim is to}} study effectiveness of simple <b>selectors</b> and extended <b>selectors</b> {{as well as to}} provide experimental results for the concept learning method. The evaluation results show that the concept learning method is valuable and extended <b>selectors</b> support it significantly.|$|R
30|$|Extended <b>selectors</b> {{are useful}} for the {{granulation}} process. Using them, we have more <b>selectors</b> {{that can be used}} to split blocks and we can obtain better partitions than using only simple <b>selectors.</b> Furthermore, using extended <b>selectors,</b> the number of iterations of the main loop of the learning method is usually reduced significantly. This leads to simpler resulting concepts with higher accuracy in classifying new objects.|$|R
5|$|Gallaher's {{brother-in-law}} Bolla Francis {{played for}} Ponsonby, Auckland and New Zealand sides {{for a number}} of years, including when Gallaher was a <b>selector.</b> In 1911, at age 29, and in the twilight of his All Blacks' career, he decided to switch to the professional sport of rugby league. Francis went on to represent New Zealand in rugby league, making him a dual-code international. It is unlikely his switch to rugby league was done without Gallaher's knowledge. Francis did eventually return to rugby union as a coach.|$|E
5|$|He was a Test <b>selector</b> for the Australian {{team from}} 1970 to 1981, filling the vacancy {{left by the}} {{retirement}} of former Test captain Ryder. Loxton's tenure on the selection panel coincided with a period of great upheaval in Australian cricket, {{on and off the}} field. Up until 1965, Australia had never lost a Test series to any country other than England, and their bilateral contests were regarded as the de facto world championship. However, in the next five years, Australia lost away to the West Indies 2–1, and to South Africa twice, 3–1 and 4–0 respectively. The former all-rounder became a <b>selector</b> after the whitewash in South Africa, joining Bradman and Harvey on the panel. During the 1970–71 home series against England, which Australia lost 2–1, the trio made a raft of changes, handing debuts to nine players, the largest number in a season since 1945–46 when competition resumed after World War II. One of the new players that Harvey and Loxton recommended to Bradman was Dennis Lillee, who went on to become one of Australia's greatest fast bowlers and the world’s leading wicket-taker. However, the season ended acrimoniously when captain Bill Lawry was sacked before the final Test without being informed of his fate; he only learned of his omission second hand.|$|E
5|$|However, the SA Cricket Association had no {{hesitation}} in appointing Bradman as their {{delegate to the}} Board of Control in place of Hodgetts. Now working alongside {{some of the men}} he had battled in the 1930s, Bradman quickly became a leading light in the administration of the game. With the resumption of international cricket, he was once more appointed a Test <b>selector,</b> and {{played a major role in}} planning for post-war cricket.|$|E
