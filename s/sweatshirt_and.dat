2500|$|At around 9:05p.m. EDT on Wednesday, June 17, 2015, the Charleston Police Department began {{receiving}} {{calls of}} a shooting at Emanuel AME Church. A man described as white, with sandy-blond hair, around 21 {{years old and}} [...] in height, wearing a gray <b>sweatshirt</b> <b>and</b> jeans, opened fire with a Glock 41 [...]45-caliber handgun {{on a group of}} people inside the church at a Bible study attended by Pinckney. The shooter then fled the scene. He had been carrying eight magazines holding hollow-point bullets. Until surpassed by the 2017 Sutherland Springs church shooting, this was the largest mass shooting at an American place of worship, alongside a 1991 attack at a Buddhist temple in Waddell, Arizona.|$|E
2500|$|Closing out the year, Watching Movies {{with the}} Sound Off {{was named to}} {{multiple}} [...] "Albums of the Year" [...] lists by major publications. Complex ranked the album number 12 on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "Mac's greatest asset isn't his bars, it's his songwriting. When he actually {{moves away from the}} dusty, MF Doomy, Stones-Throwish beats that dominate the album, he not only diversifies his sound, he hits his full stride." [...] The album was also named a runner-up for Album of the Year at the 2013 HipHopDX Year End Awards. They elaborated saying, [...] "Mac moved geographically and spiritually, and he also moved units. He wasted no time entrenching himself in the Left Coast music scene—primarily through his work with Odd Future members Earl <b>Sweatshirt</b> <b>and</b> The Internet." ...|$|E
50|$|From 1936 - 2002 (with the {{exception}} of the 1974 alternate home uniform), the club sported blue undershirts or <b>sweatshirts</b> <b>and</b> tri-colored stirrup stockings, with a red anklet and two white stripes on a navy blue background on the upper sock. In 1974, the team wore red <b>sweatshirts</b> (<b>and</b> solid red stirrups) at home and traditional blue sweats with tri-colored stirrups on the road. Since 2003, the team has worn all-red stockings with both their home and away uniform sets, along with red sweatshirts, with one exception: as part of the 2009 logo and uniform redesign, the Red Sox initially wore solid blue stockings <b>and</b> <b>sweatshirts</b> with their road uniforms. The changes drew some criticism from fans for being too similar to the Yankees' uniforms, and the team switched back to red <b>sweatshirts</b> <b>and</b> stockings after their first road trip and the remainder of the season. While Curt Schilling notably wore stirrup stockings during his Boston career, most players have abandoned stirrups for full socks.|$|R

2500|$|First {{impression}} formation can {{be influenced}} by the use of cognitive short hands such as stereotypes and representative heuristics. [...] When asked to rate the socioeconomic status (SES) and degree of interest in friendship with African American and Caucasian female models wearing either a K-Mart, Abercrombie & Fitch, or non-logoed sweatshirt, Caucasian models were rated more favorably than the African American models. Abercrombie & Fitch wearers were rated as higher SES than the other sweatshirts. Interestingly, participants wanted to be friends with the Caucasian model most when she was wearing a plain <b>sweatshirt</b> <b>and</b> the African American model most when she was wearing either the plain or K-Mart sweatshirt. It is unclear why the plain sweatshirt was most associated with friendship, but the general results suggest that mismatching class and race reduced the model's friendship appeal.|$|E
2500|$|Rolling Stone {{positioned}} it {{at number}} 19 {{on their list}} of the 20 best hip hop albums of the year. They commented saying, [...] "Mac Miller surprised critics and fans alike with his experimental Album Two. The plucky Pittsburgh MC culled influences from everyone from Flying Lotus to Schoolboy Q, while showcasing his own brand of dusty, space-funk-influenced production." [...] It was ranked at number 14 on XXLs list of the best albums of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "Along with several guest appearances from Ab-Soul to Earl <b>Sweatshirt</b> <b>and</b> Action Bronson, Miller improved lyrically as he bridged the gap between hip-hop and party anthems with records such as [...] "Gees" [...] and [...] "The Star Room", which displayed a much more strikingly viewpoint of an independent hip-hop artist." [...] HipHopDX deemed {{it one of the}} top 25 albums of 2013 saying, [...] "Mac Miller went far left for his 2013 effort. He credits a lot of the sonics to his own personal tastes, growth and {{a lot of time with}} Odd Future offshoots, The Internet. He mixed the same early bravado and experimentation from his debut into an album that didn't so much push the envelope as rip up the envelope and throw all of his influences in a blender." ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether women aged 65 and older are wearing <b>sweatshirts</b> <b>and</b> sweatpants for activewear, and, if so, to investigate the types of activities they are worn for, reasons for wearing, feature preferences, and fitting problems.
