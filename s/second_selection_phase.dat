Realized within full-sib family heritabilities (hR 2) {{in the first phase}} of selection (0 - 14 generations) were larger in 16 -pair lines than in 4 - and 8 -pair lines. In the second phase of selection (> 14 generations), hR 2 declined significantly (P<. 01) in all lines, and only the I 16 and M 16 lines had hR 2 values significantly (P<. 01) greater than zero. Realized genetic correlations involving number born, 12 -day litter weight, weaning weight and six-week weight tended to decline in the second phase of selection. The I 16, M 16 and control (C 16) replicates were crossed in all combinations at generation 14. Crosses were then selected within litters for high postweaning gain. The hR 2 values in the crossbred lines were all larger than those in the <b>second</b> <b>selection</b> <b>phase</b> for M 16 - 1, M 16 - 2 and I 16 - 1, but not for I 16 - 2. Within each Ne level, total response was significantly (P<. 01) less for I lines compared with M lines. Total response increased as Ne increased, within each level of i. Relatively small differences in realized i values among Ne lines could not account for this result. The difference in total response among the Ne lines at a given selection intensity may be due to inbreeding depression and a combination of interactions involving "drift" and selection. By crossing replicates of the M lines with the C 16 control, the effects of inbreeding depression were removed. Inbreeding depression and genetic drift, as defined herein, were equally important in accounting for differences among Ne lines in total response...|$|E
40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Biologia (Biologia do Desenvolvimento), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2011 Upon {{hydration}} in {{a simple}} medium, pollen grains germinate and develop a cytoplasmic extension designated as the pollen tube, {{the growth rate of}} which can reach up to 4 μm s- 1, {{making it one of the}} fastest polarized cellular growths in nature. This apical growth is oscillatory and its control has been systematically shown to be underlined by ion dynamics, namely ion fluxes across the membrane and cytoplasmatic ionic gradients. These phenomena were identified and characterized by means of imaging techniques and by Self Referencing Vibrating Probes. Thus far the ions known to be involved are Chloride (Cl-), Calcium (Ca 2 +), Proton (H+) and Potassium (K+), which apical fluxes oscillate with the same frequency as that of the apical growth. Zonia et al. (2002) identified and characterized the Cl- fluxes in growing pollen tubes from two species, Lilium longiflorum and Nicotiana tabacum, showing that this ion leaves the pollen tube through an oscillating efflux at the tip and enters through a non-oscillating influx at the shank of the tube, starting at approximately 15 μm from the tip. These authors also associated the efflux of Cl- to the Ins(3, 4, 5, 6) P 4 (Inositol 3, 4, 5, 6 tetra-kis-phosphate) signaling pathway. This compound, known for inhibiting receptor mediated Ca 2 + dependent Cl- currents, inhibited the pollen tube growth, induced the increase of the cellular volume and compromised the normal efflux of Cl-. Other inhibitors were also tested: DIDS (4, 4 '-di-iso-tiocianate-stilbeno- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid), o NPPB (5 -nitro- 2 -(3 -fenil-propil-amino) benzoic acid) and niflumic acid completely inhibited the pollen tube growth, the cytoplasmic streaming and caused the increase of the cellular volume. Nevertheless, only DIDS completely abolished the oscillatory effluxes of Cl-. Zonia et al. (2002) showed that the Cl- fluxes are essential to the pollen tube growth due to its role in the maintenance of the cellular volume. This observation let to the hypothesis that the fluxes of water through the plasma membrane follow the fluxes of Cl-. The work developed in this thesis lay with the isolation and characterization of the anionic currents present in the pollen grain protoplasts of two species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Lilium longiflorum. The first species was chosen due to the fact that it is the biological model for plants, endowing it with the necessary molecular tools for the latter identification of the channel or channels responsible for the Cl- fluxes reported in Zonia et al. (2002). The second species was chosen not only because it has been recurrently used as a model in the study of development of pollen tubes, but also because it would allow for a comparison between the same type of currents in two very different species. The necessity of developing specific protocols for the isolation of the anionic currents in this system stemmed from the fact that, although there was already published reports on anionic currents in plant cell protoplasts, namely from leaf meristem, from stomata and from apical root cells, the existing protocols were inadequate, for producing quality protoplasts and for not allowing the patch clamp technique to be applied. It was necessary to adjust the time of incubation in the enzyme solution, and the time and speed of the centrifugation steps in the protocol for the production and isolation of protoplasts. For the isolation of the anionic currents it was necessary to adjust the osmolarity of the bath and pipette solutions, their ionic content. The anionic currents found in the plasma membrane of pollen grain protoplasts from Arabidopsis thaliana and Lilium longiflorum were characterized by means of the Whole Cell (WC) configuration of the patch clamp technique, under symmetrical anionic concentrations, in which Cl- was the permeable anion in greater concentration. Under these experimental conditions, it was possible to identify, in the protoplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana, three different anionic current populations, all with a strong outward rectification. These were ICl 1 (current lost during rundown, after the establishment of the WC configuration), ICl 2 (current insensitive to the inhibitor NPPB), and ICl 3 (current inhibited by 100 μM of NPPB). ICl 2 and ICl 3 were measured after rundown. Despite the strong outward rectification, the putative channels responsible for the detected anionic currents allow the passage of current in both directions (inwardly and outwardly), since both negative and positive currents suffered rundown and were inhibited by NPPB. The currents presented a time dependent activation for the more positive membrane potentials (Vm), that is, an activation induced by depolarizing Vm. This can be described by three current components, one which is instantaneous - Iinst (sub millisec) and two which are time dependent - I 1 e I 2, characterized by the time constants  1 (hundreds of millisec) and  2 (tens of millisec), respectively. Using a tail protocol it was possible to observe that these currents are also characterized by a hyperpolarizing time dependent deactivation. The variation of the cord conductance (G) with Vm was also studied, by fitting a Boltzmann equation to the values of G when plotted against Vm. This analysis revealed that ICl 1 has a different sensitivity to variation in Vm. By diminishing the Cl- concentration in the bath solution ([Cl-]out) after the rundown, it was possible, not only to confirm the anionic nature of the currents but also to determine that ICl 1 and ICl 3 are regulated by [Cl-]out. The ionic selectivity of the two populations of currents was studied by replacing part of the [Cl-]out by NO 3 -. It was possible to conclude that the permeability to NO 3 - was two times higher than to Cl- (PNO 3 -/PCl-). The effect of three different intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca 2 +]in, in the nM, μM and mM range), was studied showing that all three currents increased in intensity with increasing [Ca 2 +]in, while their sensitivity to NPPB decreased. The sensitivity of G to variations in Vm was not changed. The populations of anionic currents - ICl 1, ICl 2 and ICl 3 – with very similar characteristics were also found in pollen grain protoplasts from Lilium longiflorum. These differed, not only in the response to [Ca 2 +]in, but also in the sensitivity to NPPB, which was inferior, since the minimal NPPB concentration needed was 500 μM. Other differences laid with the PNO 3 -/PCl-, which in these currents was 1. 2, and with the fact that these were not regulated by [Cl-]out. From the values of the currents it was possible to calculate the anionic fluxes that these could originate. By varying the Vm and [Ca 2 +]in is was possible to oscillate the values of the calculated fluxes in a manner compatible with the observed Cl- fluxes reported by Zonia et al. (2002) in growing pollen tubes from Lilium longiflorum. It was not possible to perform the same comparison for Arabidopsis thaliana, since the Cl- fluxes in growing pollen tubes haven’t been characterized in this species yet. Nevertheless it is possible to claim with some level of confidence that the anionic currents here described can be responsible for the observed fluxes. The identification of the channel or channels responsible for the observed anionic currents was also attempted. Through the analysis of the pollen grain transcriptomic it was possible to isolate the following gene candidates: CLC-c, CLC-d, MSL 10, ALMT 12, SLAH 2, SLAH 3 and CaCC. The first two genes, CLC-c and CLC-d, were eliminated in a <b>second</b> <b>selection</b> <b>phase,</b> not only because they were both localized in intracellular membranes, namely the tonoplast and the trans-Golgi network, but also because all the CLC channels so far characterized revealed themselves as anion:H+ cotransporters. MSL 10 was also eliminated because these channels aren’t regulated by cytoplasmic Ca 2 + or by Vm. ALMT 12 was eliminated because, unlike the currents elicited by this channel, the anionic currents described here suffered a decrease in intensity when 5 mM of malate was added to the bath solution, indicating a smaller permeability to this anion. The candidates SLAH 2 and SLAH 3, homologues of SLAC 1, were not selected because they have yet to be electrophysiologically characterized. The best candidate was CaCC, since the currents in the animal homologues have been characterized, revealing themselves very similar to the ones described in this thesis. Unfortunately it was impossible to confirm this identification due to a lack of a true KO mutant for this gene. Ao germinar, o grão de pólen forma uma extensão citoplasmática designada por tubo polínico, cujo crescimento é polarizado e apical, podendo atingir os 4 μm s- 1. Este crescimento distingue-se por ser oscilatório e por estar intimamente associado a fluxos iónicos através da membrana plasmática e aos gradientes citoplasmáticos que os fluxos originam. Estes fenómenos foram identificados e caracterizados através de técnicas de Imagiologia e de Sondas Vibráteis Auto Referenciáveis. Até à data os iões que se sabem estar envolvidos são o Cloreto (Cl-), Cálcio (Ca 2 +), Protão (H+) e Potássio (K+), cujos fluxos apicais oscilam com a mesma frequência que o crescimento. Zonia e colaboradores (2002) identificaram e caracterizaram os fluxos de Cl- em tubos polínicos de duas espécies, Lilium longiflorum e Nicotiana tabacum, mostrando que este ião sai do tubo polínico através de um efluxo oscilante no ápice e entra através de um influxo não oscilante nos lados do tubo, e que tem inicio a aproximadamente 15 μm da ponta. Estes autores associaram o efluxo de Cl- à via de sinalização do Ins(3, 4, 5, 6) P 4 (Inositol 3, 4, 5, 6 tetra-kis-fosfato). Este composto, conhecido por inibir correntes de Cl- dependentes de Ca 2 + e mediadas por receptores, inibiu o crescimento do tubo polínico, induziu o aumento do volume celular e comprometeu o normal efluxo de Cl-. Outros inibidores de correntes aniónicas também foram testados: o DIDS (ácido 4, 4 '-di-iso-tiocianato-stilbeno- 2, 2 '-disulfónico), o NPPB (ácido 5 -nitro- 2 -(3 -fenil-propil-amino) benzóico) e o ácido niflúmico inibiram completamente o crescimento do tubo polínico, o streaming citoplasmático e causaram o aumento do volume celular. No entanto, apenas o DIDS conseguiu destruir os efluxos oscilatórios de cloreto. Com este artigo, Zonia e colaboradores (2002) mostraram que os fluxos de Cl- são essenciais ao crescimento do tubo devido ao seu papel na manutenção do volume celular. Esta observação levou à hipótese de que os fluxos de água através da membrana plasmática seguiam os fluxos de Cl-. O trabalho desenvolvido durante o meu doutoramento e que conduziu a esta tese prendeu-se com o isolamento e a caracterização das correntes aniónicas em protoplastos de grão de pólen de duas espécies, a Arabidopsis thaliana e o Lilium longiflorum. A primeira espécie foi escolhida por ser o modelo biológico das plantas e por possuir as ferramentas moleculares necessárias à identificação dos possíveis canais responsáveis pelos fluxos de Cl- descritos por Zonia e colaboradores (2002). A segunda espécie foi escolhida não só por ser um modelo recorrentemente utilizado no estudo do desenvolvimento em tubos polínicos, mas também por permitir uma comparação entre o mesmo tipo de correntes em duas espécies tão distintas. A necessidade de desenvolver protocolos específicos para o isolamento das correntes aniónicas neste sistema surgiu do facto de, apesar de já se ter estudado correntes aniónicas em protoplastos de células vegetais, nomeadamente do meristema da folha, dos estomas e da raiz apical, os protocolos existentes eram desadequados, quer por não produzirem protoplastos de qualidade, quer por impedirem a aplicação da técnica de patch clamp. No protocolo para a produção e isolamento de protoplastos foi necessário ajustar os tempos de incubação na solução enzimática e a velocidade e tempo de centrifugação. Para o isolamento das correntes aniónicas foi necessário ajustar a osmolaridade das soluções de banho e de pipeta, ajustar as concentrações dos iões em solução. As correntes aniónicas presentes na membrana plasmática dos protoplastos de grãos de pólen de Arabidopsis thaliana e Lilium longiflorum foram caracterizadas na configuração de célula inteira (Whole-Cell, WC) da técnica de retalho controlado (patch clamp), sob condições simétricas de concentração aniónica, sendo o Cl-, o ião permeável presente em maior quantidade. Nestas condições experimentais foram identificadas nos protoplastos de Arabidopsis thaliana três populações diferentes de correntes aniónicas, todas com rectificação positiva: ICl 1 (corrente perdida por rundown depois da entrada em WC – diluição de factores intracelulares para a pipeta por difusão), ICl 2 (corrente insensível a NPPB), e ICl 3 (corrente inibida por 100 μM de NPPB). ICl 2 e ICl 3 foram medidas depois do rundown. Apesar da forte rectificação outward, os possíveis canais responsáveis pelas correntes aniónicas detectadas permitem a passagem de corrente em ambas as direcções (inward e outward), já que quer as correntes positivas, quer as negativas sofrem perda de intensidade por rundown e são inibidas por NPPB. As correntes apresentam também uma activação dependente do tempo para os potenciais de membrana (Vm) mais positivos, isto é, induzida por potenciais de membrana (Vm) depolarizantes, podendo esta ser descrita com três componentes, uma instantânea - Iinst (sub milissegundos) e duas dependentes do tempo - I 1 e I 2, caracterizadas pelas constantes  1 (centenas de milissegundos) e  2 (dezenas de milissegundos), respectivamente. Utilizando um protocolo de cauda, foi possível observar que estas correntes sofrem também uma desactivação dependente do tempo, desta vez induzida por Vm hiperpolarizantes. A variação da condutância corda (G) destas correntes com Vm também foi estudada. Aos resultados obtidos foi ajustada uma equação de Boltzmann, cujos parâmetros demonstraram uma sensibilidade diferente de ICl 1 a variações no Vm. Diminuindo a concentração de Cl- na solução de banho ([Cl-]out), depois de o rundown terminar, permitiu descobrir que as populações ICl 2 e ICl 3 são reguladas por [Cl-]out. A selectividade iónica das populações ICl 2 e ICl 3 foi estudada através da substituição de parte da [Cl-] na solução de banho por NO 3 -, chegando-se à conclusão que a permeabilidade ao NO 3 - era duas vezes maior que a permeabilidade ao Cl- (PNO 3 -/PCl-). Foi também averiguado o efeito de três concentrações intracelulares de cálcio diferentes ([Ca 2 +]in, na gama de nM, μM e mM), mostrando que as três diferentes populações de correntes viram a sua intensidade aumentar com o aumento de [Ca 2 +]in, enquanto a sensibilidade ao NPPB diminuía. A sensibilidade da condutância corda a variações do Vm não se modificou. Três populações de correntes aniónicas - ICl 1, ICl 2 e ICl 3 - com características semelhantes foram medidas em protoplastos de grãos de pólen de Lilium longiflorum. Estas diferiram não só na resposta ao [Ca 2 +]in mas também na sensibilidade ao NPPB, que era inferior, já que a concentração mínima de NPPB necessária foi de 500 μM. Outras diferenças prenderam-se com PNO 3 -/PCl-, que no caso destas populações de correntes foi de 1. 2, e com o facto de estas não serem reguladas por [Cl-]out. A partir dos valores das correntes foi possível calcular os fluxos aniónicos que estas poderiam originar. Fazendo variar o Vm e a [Ca 2 +]in foi possível fazer oscilar os valores dos fluxos calculados de forma compatível com os fluxos de Cl- descritos em tubos polínicos em crescimento de Lilium longiflorum. Não foi possível realizar a mesma comparação para a Arabidopsis thaliana, uma vez que os fluxos de Cl- ainda não foram descritos para esta espécie. Apesar disso é possível afirmar com alguma segurança que as correntes aniónicas aqui descritas podem ser responsáveis pelos fluxos observados. Durante o meu doutoramento também foi realizada uma tentativa de identificar o canal ou canais responsáveis pelas correntes observadas. Através da análise transcriptómica dos grãos de pólen de Arabidopsis foi possível isolar numa primeira fase os seguintes candidatos: CLC-c, CLC-d, MSL 10, ALMT 12, SLAH 2, SLAH 3 e CaCC. Os dois primeiros candidatos, CLC-c e CLC-d, foram eliminados numa segunda fase, não só por terem sido localizados em membranas intracelulares, nomeadamente no tonoplasto e nas vesículas trans-Golgianas, mas também porque até à data os CLC caracterizados revelaram-se cotransportadores anião:H+. O MSL 10 foi eliminado uma vez que estes canais não são regulados pelo Ca 2 + citosólico ou pela voltagem. O ALMT 12 foi eliminado como candidato pois, ao se adicionar 5 mM de malato às correntes aniónicas encontradas nos protoplastos de grãos de pólen de Arabidopsis thaliana, estas sofreram uma diminuição na sua intensidade, indicando que estes canais são menos permeáveis ao malato, ao contrário dos ALMT 12. Os possíveis canais SLAH 2 e SLAH 3, homólogos ao canal SLAC 1, acabaram por não ser escolhidos uma vez que os respectivos canais ainda não foram caracterizados. O candidato que se revelou ser o melhor foi o CaCC, uma vez que as correntes dos homólogos em animais já foram caracterizadas, tendo-se revelado muito semelhantes às descritas nesta tese. Infelizmente foi impossível confirmar esta identificação devido à falta de um verdadeiro mutante KO para o gene em questão. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(FCT, SFRH/BD/ 27399 / 2006...|$|E

When this phase is implemented as an optimization process, the search criterion and the search algorithm are the two major topics involved. In this thesis, we concentrate in optimization processes conducted using genetic algorithms guided by both single- and multi-objective functions. We first focus on finding the best search criterion. Various search criteria are investigated, such as diversity, the error rate and ensemble size. Error rate and diversity measures are directly compared in the single-objective optimization approach. Diversity measures are combined with the error rate and with ensemble size, in pairs of objective functions, to guide the multi-optimization approach. Experimental results are presented and discussed. Thereafter, we show that besides focusing {{on the characteristics of}} the decision profiles of ensemble members, the control of overfitting at the <b>selection</b> <b>phase</b> of overproduce-and-choose strategy must also be taken into account. We show how overfitting can be detected at the <b>selection</b> <b>phase</b> and present three strategies to control overfitting. These strategies are tailored for the classifier ensemble selection problcm and compared. This comparison allows us to show that a global validation strategy should be applied to control overfitting in optimization processes involving a classifier ensembles selection task. Furthermore, this study has helped us establish that this global validation strategy {{can be used as a}} tool to measure the relationship between diversity and classification performance when diversity measures are employed as single-objective functions. Finally, the main contribution of this thesis is a proposed dynamic overproduce-and-choose strategy. While the static overproduce-and-choose selection strategy has traditionally focused on finding the most accurate subset of classifiers during the <b>selection</b> <b>phase,</b> and using it to predict the class of all the test samples, our dynamic overproduce-and- choose strategy allows the selection of the most confident subset of classifiers to label each test sample individually.

The implied literals of each literal is computed dynamically during the search. Therefore, it is call a dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> strategy. In general, computing dynamically a weight is time-consuming. Hence, so far no SAT solver applies successfully a dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection.</b> Since the implied literal of our strategy conforms to that of the search process, the usual two watched-literals scheme can be applied here. Thus, the cost of our dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> is very low. To improve Glucose 2. 0 which won a Gold Medal for application category at SAT 2011 competition, we build five <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> schemes using the dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> policy. On application instances of SAT 2011, Glucose improved by the dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> is significantly better than the original Glucose. We conduct also experiments on Lingeling, using the dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> policy, and build two <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> schemes. Experimental results show that the improved Lingeling is better than the original Lingeling. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures, 4 table...|$|R
