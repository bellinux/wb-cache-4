5|$|Australias keel {{was laid}} at John Brown & Company's Clydebank yard on 23 June 1910, and was {{assigned}} the yard number 402. The ship was launched by Lady Reid on 25 October 1911, {{in a ceremony}} which received extensive media coverage. Australias design was altered during construction to incorporate improvements in technology, including the newly developed nickel-steel armour plate. While it was intended that the entire ship be fitted with the new armour, manufacturing problems meant that older armour had {{to be used in}} some sections: the delay in <b>sourcing</b> the older armour plates set construction back half a year. Despite this, John Brown & Company delivered the ship £295,000 under budget.|$|E
5|$|By late 1988, the Pioneer Square station {{structure}} was 70 percent complete, and work had begun on the station's entrances and the vaulted ceiling. The station {{was the subject}} of two controversies during its construction over the use of South African materials in its construction, as the country was then under a Metro boycott for its Apartheid policies. In late 1987, Atkinson-Dillingham was forced to remove steel beams used for temporary shoring at the station box after unknowingly <b>sourcing</b> it from South Africa. Metro later acquired South African black granite {{to be used in the}} station's platform and mezzanine, which was discovered and returned; the incident resulted in the resignation of Metro's executive director, amid outcry from African American leaders.|$|E

Delays in the first flight and certification of the RJX pushed back expected delivery to Drukair to after April 2002. BAe Systems cancelled the RJX program in November 2002, due to receiving orders from only two airlines, Drukair and British European. With British European threatening legal action to enforce their contract with BAE Systems, the aircraft manufacturer offered to fulfil the contract for Drukair, although airline management decided against acquiring the aircraft, citing potential problems with <b>sourcing</b> spare parts for the aircraft in future.|$|E

5|$|During the 1640s and 1650s, Velázquez {{served as}} both court painter and curator of PhilipIV's {{expanding}} collection of European art. He {{seems to have}} been given an unusual degree of freedom in the role. He supervised the decoration and interior design of the rooms holding the most valued paintings, adding mirrors, statues and tapestries. He was also responsible for the <b>sourcing,</b> attribution, hanging and inventory of many of the Spanish king's paintings. By the early 1650s, Velázquez was widely respected in Spain as a connoisseur. Much of the collection of the Prado today—including works by Titian, Raphael, and Rubens—were acquired and assembled under Velázquez's curatorship.|$|E

5|$|As in the First World War, white Rhodesians {{volunteered for}} the forces readily and in large numbers. Over 2,700 had come forward before the war was three weeks old. Somewhat ironically, the Southern Rhodesian recruiters' main problem was not <b>sourcing</b> {{manpower}} but rather persuading men in strategically important occupations such as mining to stay home. Manpower controls were introduced to keep certain men in their civilian jobs. The SRAF accepted 500 recruits {{in the days following}} the outbreak of war, prompting its commander Group Captain CW Meredith to contact the Air Ministry in London with an offer to run a flying school and train three squadrons. This was accepted. In January 1940 the Southern Rhodesian government announced the establishment of an independent Air Ministry to oversee the Rhodesian Air Training Group, Southern Rhodesia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS).|$|E

40|$|Blind <b>source</b> {{separation}} algorithms typically {{require that}} the number of <b>sources</b> are known in advance. However, it is often the case {{that the number of}} <b>sources</b> change over time and that the total number is not known. Existing <b>source</b> separation techniques require <b>source</b> number estimation methods to determine how many <b>sources</b> are active within the mixture signals. These methods typically operate on the covariance matrix of mixture recordings and require fewer active <b>sources</b> than mixtures. When <b>sources</b> do not overlap in the timefrequency domain, more <b>sources</b> than mixtures may be detected and then separated. However, separating more <b>sources</b> than mixtures when <b>sources</b> overlap in time and frequency poses a particularly difficult problem. This paper addresses the issue of <b>source</b> detection when more <b>sources</b> than sensors overlap in time and frequency.

5|$|Of {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the crewmen, soldiers, sailors and gunners alike, nothing has been recorded. The only source of information for these men has been through osteological analysis of the human bones found at the wrecksite. An approximate composition of some of the crew has been conjectured based on contemporary records. The Mary Rose would have carried a captain, a master responsible for navigation, and deck crew. There would also have been a purser responsible for handling payments, a boatswain, the captain's second in command, at least one carpenter, a pilot in charge of navigation, and a cook, all of whom had one or more assistants (mates). The ship was also staffed by a barber-surgeon who tended to the sick and wounded, along with an apprentice or mate and possibly also a junior surgeon. The only positively identified person who went down with the ship was Vice-Admiral George Carew. McKee, Stirland and several other authors have also named Roger Grenville, father of Richard Grenville of the Elizabethan-era Revenge, captain during the final battle, although the accuracy of the <b>sourcing</b> for this has been disputed by maritime archaeologist Peter Marsden.|$|E
25|$|During seed based {{restoration}} projects, it {{is generally}} recommended to source from local populations, to minimize the effects of maladaptation. One of the many challenges of restoration is that every species is different and requires different <b>sourcing</b> guidelines. Rather than putting strict distance recommendations, other guidelines recommend <b>sourcing</b> seeds to match similar environmental conditions. For example, <b>sourcing</b> for Castilleja levisecta found that farther source populations that matched similar environmental variables were better suited for the restoration project than closer source populations. Restoration guidelines vary drastically between states and agency. For example, Minnesota is broken up into 9 seed <b>sourcing</b> zones, where its neighbor Iowa, is broken into three latitudinal zones. US Forest Service recently developed provisional seed zones based {{on a combination of}} minimum winter temperature zones, aridity, and the Level III ecoregions.|$|E
