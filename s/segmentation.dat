25|$|During the <b>segmentation</b> of {{vertebrate}} embryos, {{waves of}} gene expression sweep across the presomitic mesoderm, the tissue {{from which the}} precursors of the vertebrae (somites) are formed. A new somite is formed upon arrival of a wave at the anterior end of the presomitic mesoderm. In zebrafish, {{it has been shown}} that the shortening of the presomitic mesoderm during <b>segmentation</b> leads to a Doppler effect as the anterior end of the tissue moves into the waves. This Doppler effect contributes to the period of <b>segmentation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hedgehog is also {{involved}} in <b>segmentation</b> in the annelid worms; because parallel evolution seems unlikely, this suggests a common origin of <b>segmentation</b> between the two phyla. Whilst Hh does not induce the formation of segments, it seems to act to stabilize the segmented fields once they have appeared.|$|E
25|$|This <b>segmentation</b> {{may result}} from {{deliberate}} policy. <b>Segmentation</b> and positioning are powerful marketing techniques, but the trade-off—against better focus—is that market segments may effectively be put beyond reach.

30|$|As LCE ≤ GCE for any two <b>segmentations,</b> it {{is clear}} that GCE is a tougher measure than LCE. Martin et al. showed that, as expected, when pairs of human <b>segmentations</b> of the same image are compared, both the GCE and the LCE are low; conversely, when random pairs of human <b>segmentations</b> are compared, the {{resulting}} GCE and LCE are high.|$|R
25|$|Notch {{signaling}} {{is central}} to somitogenesis. In 1995, Notch1 was shown to be important for coordinating the <b>segmentation</b> of somites in mice. Further studies identified the role of Notch signaling in the <b>segmentation</b> clock. These studies hypothesized that the primary function of Notch signaling does not act on an individual cell, but coordinates cell clocks and keep them synchronized. This hypothesis explained the role of Notch signaling {{in the development of}} <b>segmentation</b> and has been supported by experiments in mice and zebrafish. Experiments with Delta1 mutant mice that show abnormal somitogenesis with loss of anterior/posterior polarity suggest that Notch signaling is also necessary for the maintenance of somite borders.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the retrospective or off-line multiple change-point detection problem. Methods {{for exploring the}} space of possible <b>segmentations</b> of a sequence for a fixed number of change points may {{be divided into two}} categories: (i) enumeration of <b>segmentations,</b> (ii) summary of the possible <b>segmentations</b> in change-point or segment profiles. Concerning the first category, a forward dynamic programming algorithm for computing the top L most probable <b>segmentations</b> and a forward-backward algorithm for sampling <b>segmentations</b> are derived. Concerning the second category, a forward-backward dynamic programming algorithm and a smoothing-type forward-backward algorithm for computing two types of change-point and segment profiles are derived. The proposed methods are mainly useful for exploring the space of possible <b>segmentations</b> for successive numbers of change points and provide a set of assessment tools for multiple change-point models. We show using examples that the proposed methods may help to compare alternative multiple change-point models (e. g. Gaussian model with piecewise constant variances or global variance), predict supplementary change points, highlight overestimation of the number of change points and summarize the uncertainty concerning the location of change points...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{increasingly}} large {{medical imaging}} data sets be-come available {{for research and}} are analysed by a range of algorithms segmenting anatomical structures automatically and interactively. While they provide <b>segmentations</b> on a much larger scale than possible to achieve with expert annotators, they are typically less accurate than experts. We present and compare approaches to estimate <b>segmentations</b> on large imaging data sets based on {{a small number of}} expert annotated examples, and algorithmic <b>segmentations</b> on a much larger data set. Re-sults demonstrate that combining algorithmic <b>segmentations</b> is reliably outperforming the average individual algorithm. Furthermore, injecting organ specific reliability assessments of algorithms based on expert anno-tations improves accuracy compared to standard label fusion algorithms. The proposed methods are particularly relevant in putting the results of large image analysis algorithm benchmarks to long-term use...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{new method}} for {{averaging}} multidimensional images is presented, {{which is based}} on signed Euclidean distance maps computed for each of the pixel values. We refer to the algorithm as “shape-based averaging ” (SBA) because of its similarity to Raya and Udupa’s shape-based interpolation method. The new method does not introduce pixel intensities that were not present in the input data, which makes it suitable for averaging nonnumerical data such as label maps (<b>segmentations).</b> Using segmented human brain magnetic resonance images, SBA is compared to label voting for the purpose of averaging image <b>segmentations</b> in a multiclassifier fashion. SBA, on average, performed as well as label voting in terms of recognition rates of the averaged <b>segmentations.</b> SBA produced more regular and contiguous structures with less fragmentation than did label voting. SBA also was more robust for small numbers of atlases and for low atlas resolutions, in particular, when combined with shape-based interpolation. We conclude that SBA improves the contiguity and accuracy of averaged image <b>segmentations.</b> Index Terms—Combination of <b>segmentations,</b> shape-based averaging (SBA), shape-based interpolation (SBI), signed Euclidean distance transform.

To minimize the effect of tumour size factor, measurement variability was expressed {{as a percentage of the}} mean diameter/area measurement. Thus, mean SD was divided by the mean diameter or area (mean SD/diameter or area). Mean values were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test.|$|R
