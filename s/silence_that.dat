5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she is suggesting masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish {{the opposite of what}} they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E
5|$|Although Sunnydale {{has long}} been {{familiar}} with demons and monsters who have inhabited the town and fed off its residents, in this episode the conventions by which societal functions are so disrupted by the unexplained <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> significant chaos results, enough to warrant both Riley and Buffy going on patrol to keep order. Buffy and Willow walk down a familiar street, arm-in-arm and easily startled, and see a bank closed and patrons running into a liquor store that is obviously open. The breakdown of order also causes sudden religious fervor; {{a group of people}} have gathered on the street to read the Bible (Revelation 15:1 is written on a signboard—an allusion to the seven angels with seven plagues as there are seven Gentlemen, according to author Nikki Stafford). Opportunistic capitalist fervor results in a man selling overpriced dry erase boards. Community, notes Patrick Shade (citing sociologist George Herbert Mead), consists of institutions such as language, religion, and economics. When one institution disappears, Sunnydale residents begin to depend more heavily on the others. Mostly, however, individuals are isolated from one another during the silence. Even the Scoobies find their bonds shaken, as they are unable to use the witty banter that has marked them as a group thus far. (This awkwardness extended even to the actors: the first silent scene the entire cast attempted was the Scoobies gathering in Giles' apartment following the discovery that all of Sunnydale's denizens had lost their voices. It took several rehearsals as the scene came out mistimed, with all of the actors having trouble playing off one another without the use of verbal cues, or all pantomiming over one another.) Without a common language to fall back upon the Scoobies are forced to depend on their shared history to help them recover well {{enough to be able to}} take action.|$|E

25|$|Article 416 of the Italian Penal Code {{that has}} its origins in the fascist period (1930), defined simple {{organized}} crime {{on the basis of}} the presence of three elements: the associative bond, the organized structure, the criminal program. Organized crime of the mafia type presents additional specific characteristics: the associative bond has such an intimidating capacity to cause subjection and omertà. It is at such a level that it may be considered a system, an absolute rule of obedience and a law of <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> first of all demands, from the entire population, the refusal to collaborate with law enforcement. An actual submission to the power of the mafia.|$|E

25|$|A {{phone call}} on October 22, 1969, {{answered}} by freelance investigative journalist, Seymour Hersh, and his subsequent independent inquiry, broke {{the wall of}} <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> was surrounding the My Lai massacre. Hersh initially tried to sell the story to Life and Look magazines; both turned it down. Hersh {{then went to the}} small Washington-based Dispatch News Service, which sent it to fifty major American newspapers; thirty of them accepted it for publication. New York Times reporter Henry Kamm investigated further and found several My Lai massacre survivors in South Vietnam. He estimated the number of killed civilians as 567. Next, Ben Cole published an article about Ronald Ridenhour, a helicopter gunner and an Army whistleblower, who was among the first started to uncover the truth about the My Lai massacre. Joseph Eszterhas of The Plain Dealer, who was a friend of Ronald Haeberle and knew about the photo evidence of the massacre, published the grisly images of the dead bodies of old men, women, and children on November 20, 1969. Time magazine's article on November 28, 1969 and in Life magazine on December 5, 1969, finally brought My Lai to the fore of the public debate about Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|After {{the three}} beats of <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> open the score, a tubular bell is struck three times very quietly (pianissimo), with 12 beats between the strikes and gap of 18 beats {{between the groups}} of three. This bell tells {{of the death of}} Britten—it is the funeral bell. It {{continues}} to be struck in groups of three widely spaced intervals for most of the piece, fading out for a time in the last 21 bars, only to reappear at the last. After the bell has struck there is a brief pause for three beats of silence, and then the first violins begin setting the pattern which the rest of the ensemble will follow at slower speeds. Half of the first violins begin playing the descending A minor scale, playing first one note from the very top of their range, then returning to the beginning and playing two notes, and then three and four and so on. The other half of the violins play notes from an A minor chord. These notes start a fourth lower and drop in pitch only when it is overrun by the first. This creates a swirling effect of increasing tension which is relieved by dropping the note. They begin playing very quietly (pianississimo) but gradually over the piece build up until they are playing very loudly (fortississimo).|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{received}} generally well by critics. Brian Zoromski of IGN stated that: [...] "Any episode that places Michael and Dwight {{outside of their}} normal office environment is set up for some very funny (and usually awkward) situations and 'The Convention' is no exception. Some of the episode's best uncomfortable moments centered on Michael believing he's {{the life of the}} party and that he's Jim's friend. Michael and Dwight pretending to laugh along to an inside joke made by Jim's new boss, Josh, is a prime example. Michael's comment, 'I love inside jokes. Love to be part of one someday,' creates the kind of uncomfortable <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> The Office excels at." [...] Also on IGN, the show received a 9.8 out of 10 [...] "incredible" [...] rating from the site's editorial staff.|$|E
500|$|Sonnet 102 {{is a part}} of the Fair Youth sequence, and it is also {{connected}} with the surrounding sonnets (100, 101, and 103) in detailing a <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> has arisen between the poet and his muse. David West contends that this sequence may be in response to the Rival Poet sequence. The Rival Poet sequence of sonnets mention a rival for either the affections of the Fair Youth, or that they are addressing other writers that may be a [...] "worthier pen" [...] (Sonnet 79). There is a rather long list of people that scholars believe are likely candidates for the title of the fair youth addressed in the Sonnets: William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke; Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery; and Henry Wriothesley, Third Earl of Southampton are the most common candidates.|$|E
500|$|Some inter-war architects {{developed}} this approach further. Some traditional classical memorials had been criticised in both England and Germany as being fussy and overly ornate. Men such as Lutyens took the classical principles, but simplified {{them until the}} design became almost abstract. These memorials used abstract, beautiful designs intended to remove the viewer from the real world, and focus them on an idealised sense of self-sacrifice, {{a continuation of the}} principle of a [...] "beautiful death". In many ways the simplified, but still classical, forms of memorials like the Cenotaph meant that mourners could read their own thoughts and concerns onto the memorial. Where dead soldiers were shown, they were depicted in an image of serenity and peace, often physically distanced from the viewer on a high platform, the entire effect reflected by the <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> traditionally surrounds ceremonies at the Cenotaph.|$|E

500|$|The {{finished}} song is {{a combination}} of two different recording attempts. The first attempt occurred almost immediately after the Get Back/Let It Be sessions, in February 1969, with Preston. This was subsequently combined with a second version made during the Abbey Road sessions proper in April. The two sections together ran to nearly 8minutes, making it the Beatles' second-longest released track. Lennon used Harrison's Moog synthesizer with a white noise setting to create a [...] "wind" [...] effect that was overdubbed on {{the second half of the}} track. During the final edit, Lennon told Emerick to [...] "cut it right there" [...] at 7minutes and 44seconds, creating a sudden, jarring <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> concludes the first side of Abbey Road (the recording tape would have run out within 20seconds as it was). The final mixing and editing for the track occurred on 20 August 1969, the last day all four Beatles were together in the studio.|$|E
500|$|The album {{contains}} three secret tracks placed {{onto the}} twelfth track after <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> follows the track's primary song [...] "(The Return of) The Electric Horseman". The {{first of these}} is called [...] "Vladimir" [...] which, according to Fanning is about a transvestite. The second song is called [...] "SS" [...] which refers to Australian cricket bat manufacturer Stuart Surridge, which is often known by those initials. The song refers {{in part to the}} bat itself, though mostly to cricket in general, with lyrics [...] "Then we'll race like jets for the fading moon; Then we all fall down", which refers to running for the opposite crease following striking the ball, and then diving to the ground to secure the run. The third and final secret track is called [...] "Come Away" [...] which also appeared as a B-side for the single of [...] "Pick You Up". In a first for the group, it had the guitarist Darren Middleton as lead vocalist, while a spoken sound sample {{at the end of the}} song is the bass guitarist John Collins' voice.|$|E
500|$|The {{memorial}} forms a {{sharp contrast}} with both the earlier monuments of the South African War and most monuments contemporary to the First World War. Memorials of the South African War typically included figures of soldiers, sometimes dying in conflict, but always heroically in a [...] "beautiful death". Classical symbolism was often used to distance the event of death from the observer, as typified in William Colton's work at Worcester. Most First World War memorials reacted to the criticism of this approach by adopting cleaner architectural forms, but still retaining the ideal of a [...] "beautiful death", an approach which {{can be seen at}} Lutyens' Southampton Cenotaph, the precursor to his more famous Cenotaph on Whitehall. These memorials frequently used abstract, beautiful designs intended to remove the viewer from the real world, and focus them on an idealised sense of self-sacrifice. Soldiers in these memorials were still frequently depicted as Homeric warriors, and classical ideals and symbols remained popular, as can be seen at the Machine Gun Corps Memorial by Francis Derwent Wood, close to the Royal Artillery Memorial itself. Where dead soldiers were shown, they were depicted in an image of serenity and peace, often physically distanced from the viewer on a high platform, the entire effect reflected by the <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> traditionally surrounds ceremonies at the Cenotaph.|$|E
