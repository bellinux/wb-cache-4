5|$|The <b>spatial</b> <b>structure</b> and {{positioning}} of the mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{research into}} the role of young children’s <b>spatial</b> <b>structuring</b> ability in the development of number sense, particularly in terms of insight into numerical relations. We take Battista and Clements’ (1996, p. 503) definition to define the act of <b>spatial</b> <b>structuring</b> as “the mental operation of constructing an organization or form for an object or set of objects”. Insight into numerical relations involves the structuring (e. g., (de) composing) of quantities (e. g., understanding six to be three and three but also five and one or four and two), which is essential for the development of higher-order mathematical abilities. Through exploring and comparing, for example, symmetrical double-structures (as represented by egg cartons) to dot configurations (as represented by dice configurations), children can come to recognize an underlying structure such as two rows of three. Such insights can help to establish children’s awareness of <b>spatial</b> <b>structures,</b> to support children’s ability to recognize and manipulate such structures in various contexts and settings, and to use <b>spatial</b> <b>structuring</b> to abbreviate numerical procedures. The research questions are defined as follows: 1. What strategies for solving spatial and numerical problems characterize young children’s <b>spatial</b> <b>structuring</b> abilities? 2 a. How can young children be supported in learning to recognize and make use of <b>spatial</b> <b>structures</b> for abbreviating numerical procedures? 2 b. What characterizes a learning ecology that can facilitate the development of children’s <b>spatial</b> <b>structuring</b> ability? The research followed the guidelines of Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) and socio-constructivism. It was conducted at a local elementary school with an intervention group that was a combined grade 1 and grade 2 with four- to six-year old children (N = 21). A comparable non-intervention group (N = 17) did not participate in the instruction experiment, but was included to provide additional data for developing and analyzing the interviews and the instruction experiment. To answer the first research question, a set of tasks was designed for gauging children’s <b>spatial</b> <b>structuring</b> and numerical ability in a one-to-one clinical (pre- and post-) interview setting. These interviews contributed to creating a strategy inventory for classifying children’s strategies into one of four phases in a developmental trajectory, which describes children’s <b>spatial</b> <b>structuring</b> ability regarding this particular interview setting. Cumulative cyclic, classroom-based, design research was used to answer the second research question. This involved designing, testing and refining a hypothetical learning trajectory (HLT) with five corresponding instruction activities for an instruction experiment. The retrospective analysis of the data followed the principles of constant comparison. Qualitative analyses of the instruction experiment and comparisons between the phase classifications for the pre- and post-interview, reflected the benefit of an instructional setting that supports awareness of <b>spatial</b> <b>structuring</b> for fostering young children’s insight into numerical relations. This also highlighted the role of the learning ecology in a kindergarten setting regarding an overarching context, shared vocabulary, children’s own productions and constructions, interactive learning, and the socio-mathematical norm of <b>spatial</b> <b>structuring.</b> The teachers who participated had gained an increased awareness of the role of <b>spatial</b> <b>structuring</b> ability in young children’s mathematical development. As such, the local instruction theory contributes to the need for educational practice that stimulates <b>spatial</b> <b>structuring...</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>spatial</b> <b>structures</b> {{displayed}} by remote sensing imagery are essential information characterizing {{the nature and}} the scale of spatial variation of Earth surface processes. This paper provides {{a new approach to}} characterize the <b>spatial</b> <b>structures</b> within remote sensing imagery using stochastic models an geostatistic metrics. Up to now, the second-order variogram has been widely used to describe the spatial variations within an image. In this paper, we demonstrate its limitation to discriminate distinct image <b>spatial</b> <b>structures.</b> We introduce a different geostatistic metric, the first-order variogram, which used in combination with the second-order variogram, will prove its efficiency to describe the image <b>spatial</b> <b>structures.</b> We then develop a method based on the simultaneous use of both first- and second-order variogram metrics to model the image <b>spatial</b> <b>structures</b> as the weighted linear combination of two stochastic models: a Poisson line mosaic model and a multi-Gaussian model. The image <b>spatial</b> <b>structures</b> are characterized by the variance weight and the variogram range related to each model. This method is applied to several SPOT-HRV Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images from the VALERI database in order to characterize the nature of the processes structuring different types of landscape. The mosaic model is an indicator of strong NDVI discontinuities within the image mainly generated by anthropogenic processes such as the mosaic pattern of crop sites. The multi-Gaussian model shows, evidence of diffuse and continuous variation of NDVI generally engendered by ecological and environmental processes such as the fuzzy pattern observed over forest and natural vegetation sites...|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} study {{predation}} and population oscillations, Huffaker used mite species, one being the predator {{and the other}} being the prey. He set up a controlled experiment using oranges, which the prey fed on, as the spatially structured habitat in which the predator and prey would interact. At first, Huffaker experienced difficulties {{similar to those of}} Gause in creating a stable predator–prey interaction. By using oranges only, the prey species quickly became extinct followed consequently with predator extinction. However, he discovered that by modifying the <b>spatial</b> <b>structure</b> of the habitat, he could manipulate the population dynamics and allow the overall survival rate for both species to increase. He did this by altering the distance between the prey and oranges (their food), establishing barriers to predator movement, and creating corridors for the prey to disperse. These changes resulted in increased habitat patches and in turn provided more areas for the prey to seek temporary protection. When the prey would become extinct locally at one habitat patch, they were able to reestablish by migrating to new patches before being attacked by predators. This habitat <b>spatial</b> <b>structure</b> of patches allowed for coexistence between the predator and prey species and promoted a stable population oscillation model. Although the term metapopulation had not yet been coined, the environmental factors of spatial heterogeneity and habitat patchiness would later describe the conditions of a metapopulation relating to how groups of spatially separated populations of species interact with one another. Huffaker's experiment is significant because it showed how metapopulations can directly affect the predator–prey interactions and in turn influence population dynamics.|$|E
