60|$|But {{the elderly}} woman brought another interruption. She dropped her iron on the shirtwaist, {{clutched}} at the board, fumbled it, caved {{in at the}} knees and hips, and like a half-empty sack collapsed on the floor, her long shriek rising in the pent room to the acrid <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>scorching</b> cloth. The women at the boards near to her scrambled, first, to the hot iron to save the cloth, and then to her, while the forewoman hurried belligerently down the aisle. The women farther away continued unsteadily at their work, losing movements {{to the extent of}} a minute's set-back to the totality of the efficiency of the fancy-starch room.|$|E
60|$|He {{did this}} in an episodic way, {{very much as}} he gave orders to his tailor for every {{requisite}} of perfect dress, without any notion of being extravagant. On the contrary, he would have despised any ostentation of expense; his profession had familiarized him with all grades of poverty, and he cared much for those who suffered hardships. He would have behaved perfectly at a table where the sauce was served in a jug with the handle off, {{and he would have}} remembered nothing about a grand dinner except that a man was there who talked well. But {{it had never occurred to}} him that he should live in any other than what he would have called an ordinary way, with green glasses for hock, and excellent waiting at table. In warming himself at French social theories he had brought away no <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>scorching.</b> We may handle even extreme opinions with impunity while our furniture, our dinner-giving, and preference for armorial bearings in our own case, link us indissolubly with the established order. And Lydgate's tendency was not towards extreme opinions: he would have liked no barefooted doctrines, being particular about his boots: he was no radical in relation to anything but medical reform and the prosecution of discovery. In the rest of practical life he walked by hereditary habit; half from that personal pride and unreflecting egoism which I have already called commonness, and half from that naivete which belonged to preoccupation with favorite ideas.|$|E

Our troopers were pointing and slashing; well, and of course at first I myself... What would you have! An enemy's an enemy. Yet a sort of sickening awe crept into my heart. There was no tumult--only a low deep murmur dwelt over them interspersed with louder cries and groans while that mob kept on pushing and surging past us, sightless and without feeling. A <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>scorched</b> rags and festering wounds hung in the air. My horse staggered in the eddies of swaying men. But it was like cutting down galvanized corpses that didn't care. Invaders! Yes... God was already dealing with them.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} the {{blackness}} was relieved {{as if by}} the striking of a match. The man below had brought an electric torch into play, and now Jimmy could see clearly. He had been right in his surmise. It was Lord Wisbeach. He was kneeling {{in front of the}} safe. What he was doing to the safe, Jimmy could not see, for the man's body was in the way; but the electric torch shone on his face, lighting up grim, serious features quite unlike the amiable and slightly vacant mask which his lordship was wont to present to the world. As Jimmy looked, something happened in the pool of light beyond his vision. Gentleman Jack gave a muttered exclamation of satisfaction, and then Jimmy saw that the door of the safe had swung open. The air was full <b>of</b> a penetrating <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>scorched</b> metal. Jimmy was not an expert in these matters, but he had read from time to time of modern burglars and their methods, and he gathered that an oxy-acetylene blow-pipe, with its flame that cuts steel as a knife cuts cheese, had been at work.|$|R

6000|$|A LANTERN {{light from}} {{deeper in the}} barn [...] Shone on {{a man and woman}} in the door [...] And threw their lurching shadows on a house [...] Near by, all dark in every glossy window. [...] A horse's hoof pawed once the hollow floor, [...] And the back of the gig they stood beside [...] Moved in a little. The man grasped a wheel, [...] The woman spoke out sharply, [...] "Whoa, stand still!" [...] "I saw it just as plain as a white plate," [...] She said, [...] "as the light on the {{dashboard}} ran [...] Along the bushes at the roadside--a man's face. [...] You must have seen it too." [...] "I didn't see it. [...] Are you sure----" [...] "Yes, I'm sure!" [...] "--it was a face?" [...] "Joel, I'll have to look. I can't go in, [...] I can't, and leave a thing like that unsettled. [...] Doors locked and curtains drawn will make no difference. [...] I always have felt strange when we came home [...] To the dark house after so long an absence, [...] And the key rattled loudly into place [...] Seemed to warn someone to be getting out [...] At one door as we entered at another. [...] What if I'm right, and someone all the time-- [...] Don't hold my arm!" [...] "I say it's someone passing." [...] "You speak as if this were a travelled road. [...] You forget where we are. What is beyond [...] That he'd be going to or coming from [...] At such an hour of night, and on foot too. [...] What was he standing still for in the bushes?" [...] "It's not so very late--it's only dark. [...] There's more in it than you're inclined to say. [...] Did he look like----?" [...] "He looked like anyone. [...] I'll never rest to-night unless I know. [...] Give me the lantern." [...] "You don't want the lantern." [...] She pushed past him and got it for herself. [...] "You're not to come," [...] she said. [...] "This is my business. [...] If the time's come to face it, I'm the one [...] To put it the right way. He'd never dare-- [...] Listen! He kicked a stone. Hear that, hear that! [...] He's coming towards us. Joel, go in--please. [...] Hark!--I don't hear him now. But please go in." [...] "In the first place you can't make me believe it's----" [...] "It is--or someone else he's sent to watch. [...] And now's the time to have it out with him [...] While we know definitely where he is. [...] Let him get off and he'll be everywhere [...] Around us, looking out of trees and bushes [...] Till I sha'n't dare to set a foot outdoors. [...] And I can't stand it. Joel, let me go!" [...] "But it's nonsense to think he'd care enough." [...] "You mean you couldn't understand his caring. [...] Oh, but you see he hadn't had enough-- [...] Joel, I won't--I won't--I promise you. [...] We mustn't say hard things. You mustn't either." [...] "I'll be the one, if anybody goes! [...] But you give him the advantage with this light. [...] What couldn't he do to us standing here! [...] And if to see was what he wanted, why [...] He has seen all there was to see and gone." [...] He appeared to forget to keep his hold, [...] But advanced with her as she crossed the grass. [...] "What do you want?" [...] she cried to all the dark. [...] She stretched up tall to overlook the light [...] That hung in both hands hot against her skirt. [...] "There's no one; so you're wrong," [...] he said. [...] "There is.-- [...] What do you want?" [...] she cried, and then herself [...] Was startled when an answer really came. [...] "Nothing." [...] It came from well along the road. [...] She reached a hand to Joel for support: [...] The <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>scorching</b> woollen made her faint. [...] "What are you doing round this house at night?" [...] "Nothing." [...] A pause: there seemed no more to say. [...] And then the voice again: [...] "You seem afraid. [...] I saw by the way you whipped up the horse. [...] I'll just come forward in the lantern light [...] And let you see." [...] "Yes, do.--Joel, go back!" [...] She stood her ground against the noisy steps [...] That came on, but her body rocked a little. [...] "You see," [...] the voice said. [...] "Oh." [...] She looked and looked. [...] "You don't see--I've a child here by the hand." [...] "What's a child doing at this time of night----?" [...] "Out walking. Every child should have the memory [...] Of at least one long-after-bedtime walk. [...] What, son?" [...] "Then I should think you'd try to find [...] Somewhere to walk----" [...] "The highway as it happens-- [...] We're stopping for the fortnight down at Dean's." [...] "But if that's all--Joel--you realize-- [...] You won't think anything. You understand? [...] You understand {{that we have to be}} careful. [...] This is a very, very lonely place. [...] Joel!" [...] She spoke as if she couldn't turn. [...] The swinging lantern lengthened to the ground, [...] It touched, it struck it, clattered and went out.|$|E
50|$|Instead, Passive houses {{sometimes}} have a dual purpose 800 to 1,500 watt heating and/or cooling element {{integrated with the}} supply air duct of the ventilation system, for use during the coldest days.
