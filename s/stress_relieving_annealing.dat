Twenty 10 x 10 x 10 mm low carbon steel samples were divided into four groups (A, B, C and D) with five samples in each group. Group A samples were not welded while group B, C and D were welded using electric arc welding techniques and then subjected to <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>annealing.</b> Samples in group B, C and D were thereafter heat–treated by normalizing, annealing and quenching respectively.

This was determined by using two different methods of stress measurement. These methods involved strain gauges and ultrasonic testing. Specifically, critically refracted longitudinal (L[CR]) waves have been used to evaluate residual stresses and their dissipation in sample plates. The material investigated in this experiment was A. S. T. M. 1008 / 1010 steel. Each test specimen was approximately 30. 5 cm by 40. 6 cm and 1. 3 cm thick (12 in by 16 in by 1 / 2 in). Each specimen was cut with T shaped slots cut from each edge of the plate. The geometry of the plate and the welds should provide for a uniaxial tension stress field in the area of investigation. After the plates were <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> by <b>annealing,</b> the transverse slots were then welded and allowed to cool. Strain gauges were then applied to the area of interest in the middle of the plate oriented parallel to the long side of the plate. Stress measurements would be made across the weld bead. Initial ultrasonic measurements were then performed. Both sides of the plates were investigated. At differing time intervals, a sample plate's welds were cut through. Strain gauge and ultrasonic measurements were then repeated. By comparing the before and after information, differential strain measurements and ultrasonic travel times were determined. A control plate determined zero stress travel-time data. The LCR travel-time and strain gauge measurements of the plates not only indicate that there is a measurable stress relaxation in the plates, but also that it occurs in a time dependent and predictable manner. Much of the stress relief occurred soon after the weld. The peak stress 375 minutes (6 1 / 4 hours) after the weld was approximately 250 MPa (35. 5 ksi). Within 20 hours the stress had decayed to approximately 220 MPa (31. 9 ksi). At 700 hours the stress was approximately 180 MPa (26 ksi) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-Gear teeth failure due to fatigue is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} observed. Even a slight reduction in the root tensile stress results in great increase in the fatigue life of a gear. If gear fails in tensile fatigue, the results are catastrophic and occur {{with little or no}} warnings. Therefore for all the reasons mentioned above, this work is of more practical importance. For many years, gear design has been improved by using improved material, hardening surfaces with heat treatment and carburization, and shot penning to improve surface finish etc. Few more efforts have been made to improve the durability and strength by altering the pressure angle, using the asymmetric teeth, altering the geometry of root fillet curve and so on. Most of the above methods do not guarantees the interchangeability of the existing gear systems. This work presents the possibilities of using the stress redistribution techniques by introducing the <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> features in the stressed zone to the advantage of reduction of root fillet stress in spur gear. This also ensures interchangeability of existing gear systems.

One alloy (B 1) is ASTM A 532 class IA Ni-Hard containing 4. 2 wt. pct. Ni. The second alloy (B 2) is similar to B 1 but higher in Cr, Si, and Mo. The third alloy (T 1) also falls in the same ASTM specification, but it contains 3. 3 wt. pct. Ni. The alloys were evaluated in both as-cast and stress-relieved conditions except for B 2, which was evaluated in the stress-relieved condition only. While the matrix of the high Ni alloys is composed of austenite and martensite in both conditions, the matrix of the low Ni alloy consists of a considerable amount of bainite, in addition to the martensite and the retained austenite in as cast condition, and primarily bainite, with some retained austenite, in the <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> condition.
