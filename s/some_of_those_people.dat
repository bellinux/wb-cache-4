The xenomorphs, having matured, escape confinement by killing off one of their own to use their acidic blood to burn through their enclosures, aware of their blood's acidity from said genetic memory. They then capture Dr. Jonathan Gediman and kill a second scientist. They damage the Auriga and kill <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> who do not evacuate, including General Perez and Elgyn. Another crew member is cocooned for eggmorphing. Military scientist Dr. Wren reveals that the ship's default command in an emergency is to return to Earth. Realizing this will unleash the xenomorphs on Earth, Ripley 8, the mercenaries, Wren, a Marine named DiStephano and a surviving xenomorph host, Purvis, decide to head for the Betty and use it to destroy the Auriga. Along the way, Ripley 8 discovers a laboratory which contains the grotesque results of the previous seven failed attempts to clone Ellen Ripley. The surviving one begs Ripley 8 to euthanise her; she complies and then incinerates the lab and its contents.|$|E

40|$|In The Law of Peoples (1999) Rawls {{offers a}} model of the world, divided into {{countries}} without pressures of nationalism, which he calls "peoples. " If <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>peoples</b> were liberal democracies, others consult all citizens, though not equally, and others were badly governed, what obligations would the well-ordered countries have to the badly-ordered ones? There is one class of unjust society called "burdened" that is not malicious but lacks the political traditions and institutions needed to be well-ordered, and it may also be unable to care for its citizens. Well-ordered societies owe these burdened ones a "Duty of Assistance" to help them become well-ordered. Rawls thinks that what they most need is political assistance to create just institutions, and perhaps some small, temporary economic aid for acute crises, for two reasons. Economics teaches that large-scale crises like famine or mass migration are caused by (bad) governments, and aren't inevitable consequences of drought. If a just people wants to prevent large-scale disasters, donating large amounts of cash won't help. The permanent cure is just government. Also, he denies that there are any real countries that have too few resources to support their population. If so, poverty or hunger is not inevitable anywhere, and what we call problems of poverty are really symptoms of bad government. I agree that political aid is extremely important. However, I disagree with the unimportance of material assistance. First I show that his empirical ground doesn't support an "institutions only" approach. Second, I argue that (a) primary goods are heterogeneous, and redistribution means different things for different kinds of goods, (b) needs for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these may be adequately assured by good government, but not just burdened societies can have long-term need for others. The duty of Assistance requires redistribution of more goods, to more types of society than Rawls asserts. Third, Rawls argues that economic redistribution is an important matter for domestic justice, and not a concern at the international level. I challenge one of his illustrations, showing that it is not completely assured by a just domestic society. by Karen Rothkin. Thesis (S. M.)

He would not hunt for the boy, he would hunt for a crowd; in the centre of a big crowd or a little one, sooner or later, he should find his poor little friend, sure; and the mangy mob would be entertaining itself with pestering and aggravating the boy, who would be proclaiming himself King, as usual.

6000|$|Of {{course we}} ascended {{to the summit}} of the dome, and of course we also went up into the gilt copper ball which is above it.--There was room there for a dozen persons, with a little crowding, and it was as close and hot as an oven. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> who are so fond of writing their names in {{prominent}} places had been there before us--a million or two, I should think. From the dome of St. Peter's one can see every notable object in Rome, from the Castle of St. Angelo to the Coliseum. He can discern the seven hills upon which Rome is built. He can see the Tiber, and the locality of the bridge which Horatius kept [...] "in the brave days of old" [...] when Lars Porsena attempted to cross it with his invading host. He can see the spot where the Horatii and the Curatii fought their famous battle. He can see the broad green Campagna, stretching away toward the mountains, with its scattered arches and broken aqueducts of the olden time, so picturesque in their gray ruin, and so daintily festooned with vines. He can see the Alban Mountains, the Appenines, the Sabine Hills, and the blue Mediterranean. He can see a panorama that is varied, extensive, beautiful to the eye, and more illustrious in history than any other in Europe.--About his feet is spread the remnant of a city that once had a population of four million souls; and among its massed edifices stand the ruins of temples, columns, and triumphal arches that knew the Caesars, and the noonday of Roman splendor; and close by them, in unimpaired strength, is a drain of arched and heavy masonry that belonged to that older city which stood here before Romulus and Remus were born or Rome thought of. The Appian Way is here yet, and looking much as it did, perhaps, when the triumphal processions of the Emperors moved over it in other days bringing fettered princes from the confines of the earth. We can not see the long array of chariots and mail-clad men laden with the spoils of conquest, but we can imagine the pageant, after a fashion. We look out upon many objects of interest from the dome of St. Peter's; and last of all, almost at our feet, our eyes rest upon the building which was once the Inquisition. How times changed, between the older ages and the new! Some seventeen or eighteen centuries ago, the ignorant men of Rome were wont to put Christians in the arena of the Coliseum yonder, and turn the wild beasts in upon them for a show. It was for a lesson as well. It was to teach the people to abhor and fear the new doctrine the followers of Christ were teaching. The beasts tore the victims limb from limb and made poor mangled corpses of them in the twinkling of an eye. But when the Christians came into power, when the holy Mother Church became mistress of the barbarians, she taught them the error of their ways by no such means. No, she put them in this pleasant Inquisition and pointed to the Blessed Redeemer, who was so gentle and so merciful toward all men, and they urged the barbarians to love him; and they did all they could to persuade them to love and honor him--first by twisting their thumbs out of joint with a screw; then by nipping their flesh with pincers--red-hot ones, because they are the most comfortable in cold weather; then by skinning them alive a little, and finally by roasting them in public. They always convinced those barbarians. The true religion, properly administered, as the good Mother Church used to administer it, is very, very soothing. It is wonderfully persuasive, also. There is a great difference between feeding parties to wild beasts and stirring up their finer feelings in an Inquisition. One is the system of degraded barbarians, the other of enlightened, civilized people. It is a great pity the playful Inquisition is no more.|$|E

Even though this is common among many languages, older Japanese texts have the added challenge of a variant grammar structure and writing style that forces scholars {{to be aware of the}} differences in the classical variation of the language. To that end, the author named Aoki Rosui may not be a household name within many circles of Japanese literary study. Still, extensive study of the horror stories known as kaidan and hyaku monogatari as well as Edo period Japanese literature as a whole is incomplete without knowing of his life and his contribution entitled Otogi hyaku monogatari. By gaining a rudimentary knowledge of the man behind this collection of ghost tales, as well as the people who exerted a significant influence on him, his reasons and methods taken in writing his collection of stories can be explored. At the same time, the classification of certain types of media into conventions known as genres is a very ambiguous field. Working through a variety of genres, both specific to Japan and general, will reveal the sheer variety that the kaidan category allows the author to explore. Preceding the annotated translation of a selection of Otogi hyaku monogatari will be a brief introduction and analysis of each of the stories that have been selected, using various references as support for the types of mythological and historical icons contained within them.

"Two <b>of</b> <b>Those</b> Women" [...] is an {{interesting}} study of a particular section of society {{at a particular time}} — Englishwomen living in small hotels in the South of France and Italy in order to enjoy a standard of living they would be unable to maintain in England. [...] "All over the South of France and Italy particularly there are thousands of these women staying at pensions and small hotels, drifting from place to place, rudderless, unwanted, and patently unhappy. They have the atmosphere of exiles, as of people who have committed some crime in their own country, and dare not return. And in many cases the crime that they have committed is, I suspect, the unpardonable crime of poverty. Women who have held <b>some</b> kind <b>of</b> social position in their own country, and become impoverished, develop the not unreasonable idea that they can live more cheaply, and with more dignity, in a foreign hotel." [...] The two women of the title are secondary casualties of World War I. The older woman’s son has suffered mental damage, the younger woman’s lover is unaccounted for. The older woman remembers her son as he used to be, as a child and as a soldier. The dialogue is moving, all the more so for being very funny: [...] " [...] 'Games! that was what he was so good at. Cricket, football, all those things. They said there were several colleges at both Oxford and Cambridge anxious to have him because he could run a hundred yard in — ten minutes, was it?'

She made a vague gesture {{in the direction of the}} North Pole." [...] The plot leaves open the possibility of an overly neat ending — that the older woman’s son may be the younger woman’s missing lover — but this story is memorable not for its plot, but as a remarkable, sensitive portrait of a vulnerable, damaged group of people at one time and place.|$|R
