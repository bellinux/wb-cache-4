5|$|When {{the park}} was {{enclosed}} in 1637 there were six gates in the boundary wall: Coombe Gate, Ham Gate, Richmond Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate and Sheen Gate. Of these, Richmond Gate has the heaviest traffic. The present gates were designed by Sir John Soane and were widened in 1896. Sheen Gate was where the brewer John Lewis asserted pedestrian right of entry in 1755 after Princess Amelia had denied it. The present double gates date from 1926. Coombe Gate (later known as Ladderstile Gate) provided access to the park for the parishioners of Coombe, with both a gate and a step ladder. The gate was locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735. The <b>stepladder</b> was reinstated after John Lewis's case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884. The present gate dates from 1901. The present wrought iron gates of Roehampton Gate were installed in 1899. Ham Gate was widened in 1921, when the present wrought iron gates were installed. The chinoiserie lantern lights over the gate were installed in 1825.|$|E

Of these thirty-one automatic bids, a total of 30 teams receive automatic bids for winning their conference tournament championship. The Ivy League does not hold a tournament, so its regular season champion receives the automatic bid. Because Cornell, Dartmouth, and Harvard finished in a tie for first place, Ivy League rules called for a two-game <b>stepladder</b> playoff. Dartmouth defeated Harvard in the first game and went on to face Cornell for the automatic bid, which Cornell won 64-47.|$|E

Three years later, during a promotional event for the Live at Blues Alley album in July 1996, Cassidy noticed an ache in her hips, which she attributed to stiffness from painting murals while perched atop a <b>stepladder.</b> The pain persisted and X-rays revealed a fracture. Further tests found that cancer had spread to her bones, causing the fracture, {{as well as to}} her lungs. Her doctors estimated she had three to five months to live. Cassidy opted for aggressive treatment, but her health deteriorated rapidly. On September 17, at a benefit concert for her at the Bayou, she made her final public appearance, closing the set with [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] {{in front of an audience}} of family, friends, and fans. [...] Additional chemotherapy was ineffective and Cassidy died on November 2, 1996 at her family's home in Bowie, Maryland.

40|$|This {{expanded}} and {{updated version of}} a best-selling classic guides readers to help a child overcome anxiety and fears. It describes in detail strategies and techniques they can combine into a comprehensive self-help programme for a child's particular needs. From separation anxiety to general anxiety, social anxiety, specific phobia and panic disorder, the book describes the common types of childhood anxiety, how anxiety originates, and options {{for dealing with the}} problem, with or without a therapist's help. In this updated version, the progression of chapters reflects the authors' clinical programme, in which major skills are introduced early and then are consolidated and built upon in later chapters. Throughout, the book employs a step-by-step approach that is both structured and directive.

500|$|Typically, {{there were}} two dog {{trainers}} on the set, each teetering on a <b>stepladder</b> only Lassie could see and waving a chunk of meat at the dog. [...] "It would look as though Lassie was looking at Jon (Provost), but he was really looking past Jon at the piece of beef", Lockhart recalled in 2004. When Provost delivered his line, the trainer behind Lockhart would whisper [...] "Lassie!" [...] and wave another piece of meat. Lassie's head would turn to Lockhart who would deliver her line. Then the trainer behind Provost would get Lassie's attention again, and Provost would deliver his next line. [...] "The sound editor would cut out all that," [...] Lockhart said, [...] "You finally got to where you never heard the trainers. Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it." [...] In addition to the main Lassie, three other Lassies might be involved in an episode shoot: a stand-in for rehearsals, a stunt double, and a [...] "fighter" [...] for scenes involving battles with other animals.|$|E
2500|$|When the PBA Tour {{introduced}} the World Series of Bowling during the 2009–10 season, the televised finals for all tournaments {{in the series}} used the four-man <b>stepladder</b> format.

The top four qualifiers all bowled together, and the top three scorers would {{move on to the}} next match, with the lowest score finishing in fourth place. The next match would then take the two top scorers (low score finishing in third place), and these two bowlers competed head-to-head in the final match. Starting in 2012, the WSOB switched back to the four-man <b>stepladder</b> format, with the exception of the PBA World Championship which featured a five-man <b>stepladder</b> final.|$|E

40|$|The American {{legal system}} and economy {{continues}} to sink ever-further into the morass of modern tort law. Tort lawyers greet {{the introduction of new}} products to the market by opening a new file for the inevitable lawsuits that will follow. Modern tort law strangles technological innovation in the cradle and costs American consumers billions of dollars a year in higher costs and goods and services. The American tort law system is an international embarrassment and a domestic scandal. Studies estimate that the American tort law system costs upwards of $ 152 billion per year, or some 2. 2 % of American GNP (Tillinghast 1995, p. 16). This figure is roughly two-and-a-half times more expensive than the average of most major foreign industrialized nations. 1 The majority of these costs are for expenses to run the tort system itself, rather than compensation to injured parties. 2 These direct costs only capture a small element of the harm caused by a runaway tort system. Tort liability has substantially raised the price of many products, from <b>stepladders</b> (30 % of the cost of <b>stepladders)</b> to vaccines (90 % of the cost of vaccines) (Huber 1988; Discussion 1989, p. 2237).

Poppe's building was heavily ornamented, but employed a modern layout in the stacks, with metal shelving and <b>stepladders</b> rather than floor divisions for minimal fire risk and maximum visibility. It was heavily damaged in the Second World War and eventually renovated and enlarged in a simplified form with a flat roof.

In 1916, Christiansen purchased a woodworking shop in Billund which had been in business since 1895. The shop mostly helped construct houses and furniture, and had a small staff of apprentices. The workshop burned down in 1924 when a fire ignited some wood shavings. Ole Kirk constructed a larger workshop, and worked towards expanding his business even further. When the Great Depression hit, Ole Kirk had fewer customers and had to focus on smaller projects. He began producing miniature versions of his products as design aids. It was these miniature models of <b>stepladders</b> and ironing boards that inspired him to begin producing toys.|$|R
