40|$|Cajal bodies (CBs) are nuclear organelles {{involved}} in the maturation of <b>small</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>ribonucleoproteins</b> required for the processing of pre-mRNAs. They concentrate coilin, splicing factors and the survival of motor neuron protein (SMN). By using immunocytochemistry and transfection experiments with GFP-SUMO- 1, DsRed 1 -Ubc 9, GFP-coilin and GFP-SMN constructs we demonstrate the presence of SUMO- 1 and the SUMO conjugating enzyme (Ubc 9) in a subset of CBs in undifferentiated neuron-like UR 61 cells. Furthermore, SUMO- 1 is transiently localized into neuronal CBs from adult nervous tissue in response to osmotic stress or inhibition of methyltransferase activity. SUMO- 1 -positive CBs contain coilin, SMN and <b>small</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>ribonucleoproteins,</b> suggesting that they are functional CBs {{involved in}} pre-mRNA processing. Since coilin and SMN have several putative motifs of SUMO- 1 modification, we suggest that the sumoylation of coilin and/or SMN might {{play a role in}} the molecular reorganization of CBs during the neuronal differentiation or stress-response.
