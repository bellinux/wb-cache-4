25|$|In the Baltic Sea {{the most}} {{important}} species are Atlantic cod, herring, and <b>sprat.</b> Many studies that analyze the stomach contents of these fish indicate that cod is the top predator, preying on the herring and <b>sprat.</b> <b>Sprat</b> form particularly high concentrations in the Bornholm Basin in the southern Baltic Sea. Although cod feed primarily on adult <b>sprat,</b> <b>sprat</b> tend to prey on the cod eggs and larvae.|$|E
25|$|A similar cascade {{occurred}} in the Baltic Sea {{at the end of}} 1980s. After a decline in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), the abundance of its main prey, the <b>sprat</b> (Sprattus sprattus), increased and the Baltic Sea ecosystem shifted from being dominated by cod into being dominated by <b>sprat.</b> The next level of trophic cascade was a decrease in the abundance of Pseudocalanus acuspes, a copepod which the <b>sprat</b> prey on.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sprat</b> was {{designed}} to Air Ministry Specification 5/24 for an RAF advanced trainer and Fleet Air Arm deck-landing trainer. It was specified that the aircraft should be readily convertible to a seaplane, again {{to be used as}} a trainer. The specification produced contracts for three machines, the Vickers Vendace, the Parnall Perch and the <b>Sprat.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{recipe is}} often mistranslated into English, with {{anchovies}} being substituted for <b>sprats.</b> This is because <b>sprats</b> (Sprattus sprattus) pickled in sugar, salt and spices {{have been known}} in Sweden as ansjovis {{since the middle of}} the 19th century, while true anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus) are sold in Sweden as sardeller (sardelles). Also, small herrings (Clupea harengus) may be used instead of <b>sprats.</b>|$|R

The condition factor was estimated through both morphometric measures and C/N ratios. Globally, <b>sprats</b> exhibited a better condition than sardines and anchovies. <b>Sprats</b> showed a better condition in the coastal area, while anchovies presented the best condition on the continental shelf and on the shelf break. The central area was the most favorable for sardines and the most unfavorable for <b>sprats.</b> All species presented a better condition in June than in July.

25|$|The <b>Sprat,</b> {{though a}} smaller aircraft, had strong family resemblances {{to the earlier}} Velos torpedo bomber. The <b>Sprat</b> was a staggered, single-bay biplane with equal-span wings that could be folded for carrier stowage. The {{fuselage}} centre section was built around a tubular-steel structure which linked the engine mounting and the wooded-framed rear fuselage. The two dual-control open cockpits were both behind {{the trailing edge of}} the wing for optimum visibility. Unusually, the instruments were placed on the rear spar of the upper wing centre section, where they could be read from both cockpits. The rudder area was large compared to that of the fin and a braced tailplane was placed on top of the rear fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Thomas <b>Sprat</b> {{wrote his}} History of the Royal Society in 1667 and set forth, {{in a single}} document, the goals of {{empirical}} science ever after. He expressed grave suspicions of adjectives, nebulous terminology, and all language that might be subjective. He praised a spare, clean, and precise vocabulary for science and explanations that are as comprehensible as possible. In Sprat's account, the Royal Society explicitly rejected anything that seemed like scholasticism. For <b>Sprat,</b> as {{for a number of}} the founders of the Royal Society, science was Protestant: its reasons and explanations had to be comprehensible to all. There would be no priests in science, and anyone could reproduce the experiments and hear their lessons. Similarly, he emphasised the need for conciseness in description, as well as reproducibility of experiments.|$|E

This annual nomadism involved packing up everything, even the planks on the outside of their longhouses, to transport in their canoes.|$|E

25|$|Copepods {{and other}} {{zooplankton}} are plentiful in the North Sea. These tiny organisms are crucial {{elements of the}} food chain supporting many species of fish. Over 230 species of fish live in the North Sea. Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, mackerel, herring, pouting, <b>sprat,</b> and sandeel are all very common and are fished commercially. Due to the various depths of the North Sea trenches and differences in salinity, temperature, and water movement, some fish such as blue-mouth redfish and rabbitfish reside only in small areas of the North Sea.|$|E
25|$|Trabzon's {{regional}} cuisine {{is traditionally}} reliant on fish, especially hamsi (fresh European Anchovy {{similar to the}} British <b>Sprat</b> or American Smelt). Trabzon meets 20% of the total fish production in Turkey. Regional dishes include the Akçaabat köfte (spicy lamb meatball from the Akçaabat district), Karadeniz pidesi (canoe shaped pita bread, often filled with ground beef, cheese and eggs), kuymak (a Turkish fondue made with cornmeal, fresh butter and cheese), Vakfıkebir ekmeği (large country-style bread), Tonya tereyağı (Tonya butter), tava mısır ekmeği (deep-dish corn bread) and kara lahana çorbası (bean and cabbage soup). Taflan kavurması is a cherry laurel dish served with onions and olive oil. Trabzon is also famous for its hazelnuts. The Black Sea region of Turkey is the world's largest producer of cherry and hazelnut; and a large production area of tea; all of which {{play an important role}} in the local cuisine.|$|E
25|$|In 1648 Wilkins became Warden of Wadham College, in Oxford {{and under}} him the college prospered. He fostered {{political}} and religious tolerance and drew talented minds to the college, including Christopher Wren. Although he was a supporter of Oliver Cromwell, Royalists placed their sons in his charge. From those interested in experimental science, he drew together a significant group known as the Oxford Philosophical Club, which by 1650 had been constituted {{with a set of}} rules. Besides some of the London group (Goddard, Wallis, Ward, Wren who was a young protégé of Scarburgh), it included (in the account of Thomas <b>Sprat)</b> Ralph Bathurst, Robert Boyle, William Petty, Lawrence Rooke, Thomas Willis, and Matthew Wren. Robert Hooke was gradually recruited into the Wilkins group: he arrived at Christ Church, Oxford in 1653, working his way to an education, became assistant to Willis, and became known to Wilkins (possibly via Richard Busby) as a technician. By 1658 he was working with Boyle.|$|E

25|$|The {{commander}} of the East Indies station, Admiral Peter Rainier had initially assigned Lind's old command, , to escort a convoy of two East Indiamen. News of the convoy and its light escort reached Rear-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois, who was in command of a squadron raiding merchant shipping in the area, and deciding the odds were favourable, decided to attempt to capture the convoy. Unbeknownst to Linois, Rainier had decided to upgrade the convoy's escort and replaced the Wilhelmina with the 50-gun , placing Lind in temporary command, as Centurions nominal commander Captain John <b>Sprat</b> Rainier had been taken ill. Lind took command on 9 September, but had gone ashore during a stop at Vizagapatam when Linois's forces, consisting of the 74-gun Marengo and the frigates Sémillante and Atalante appeared. Lieutenant James Robert Phillips had been left in command while Lind was on shore, and opened fire on the approaching French. As soon as Lind realised what was happening he tried {{to return to his}} ship, but the Indian boatmen refused to row him out, until the French moved further away. A brief lull in the fighting allowed Lind to return to his ship, but he found the Centurions rigging had been too badly damaged to allow him to pursue the French. Instead he anchored between the French and the merchants, placing himself between them but out of range of supporting fire from the shore batteries. He attempted to arrange for cannon to be brought to the beach to provide covering fire, but this proved to be impractical.|$|E
500|$|At Madras Admiral Rainier [...] {{had become}} {{increasingly}} concerned during September by Linois's depredations, and {{had decided to}} strengthen his convoy escorts. He [...] replaced Wilhelmina with the 50-gun HMS Centurion. Centurion was under the nominal command of Captain John <b>Sprat</b> Rainier, who was seriously ill at Madras, so Captain James Lind assumed temporary command. Lind sailed from Madras to Vizagapatam earlier in the month with the Indiamen Barnaby and Princess Charlotte and anchored in the roads, while the Indiamen loaded cargo ready for the return journey to Madras. The ships were still anchored in the roads at 06:00 on 15 September when Linois's squadron appeared on the horizon to the south-west, approximately [...] away. The only flag visible on the strange ships was on board one of the frigates, which displayed the St George's Cross. Lieutenant James Robert Phillips, in command of Centurion while Lind was ashore, was not convinced by this ensign: {{he was aware that}} a French squadron was in the region, and positioned his ship so that his broadside faced the approaching vessels. At 09:45 the French came within range and Phillips opened fire, cautiously at first until he could be sure of the identity of the strangers.|$|E
500|$|There {{had been}} an attempt in 1667 to {{establish}} a permanent [...] "college" [...] for the society. Michael Hunter argues that this was influenced by [...] "Solomon's House" [...] in Bacon's New Atlantis and, to a lesser extent, by J. V. Andreae's Christianopolis, dedicated research institutes, rather than the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, since the founders only intended for the society {{to act as a}} location for research and discussion. The first proposal was given by John Evelyn to Robert Boyle in a letter dated 3 September 1659; he suggested a grander scheme, with apartments for members and a central research institute. Similar schemes were expounded by Bengt Skytte and later Abraham Cowley, who wrote in his Proposition for the Advancement of Experimental Philosophy in 1661 of a [...] "'Philosophical College", with houses, a library and a chapel. The society's ideas were simpler and only included residences for a handful of staff, but Hunter maintains an influence from Cowley and Skytte's ideas. Henry Oldenburg and Thomas <b>Sprat</b> put forward plans in 1667 and Oldenburg's co-secretary, John Wilkins, moved in a council meeting on 30 September 1667 to appoint a committee [...] "for raising contributions among the members of the society, in order to build a college". These plans were progressing by November 1667, but never came to anything, given the lack of contributions from members and the [...] "unrealised—perhaps unrealistic"—aspirations of the society.|$|E

In the Baltic, copepods of the genus Acartia can be present in large numbers. However, they are small in size with a high escape response, so herring and <b>sprat</b> avoid trying to catch them.
