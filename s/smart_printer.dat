5000|$|As {{computer}} power grew, {{it became}} possible {{to host the}} PS system in the computer rather than the printer. This led to the natural evolution of PS from a printing system to one that {{could also be used}} as the host's own graphics language. There were numerous advantages to this approach; not only did it help eliminate the possibility of different output on screen and printer, but it also provided a powerful graphics system for the computer, and allowed the printers to be [...] "dumb" [...] {{at a time when the}} cost of the laser engines was falling. In a production setting, using PostScript as a display system meant that the host computer could render low-resolution to the screen, higher resolution to the printer, or simply send the PS code to a <b>smart</b> <b>printer</b> for offboard printing.|$|E
30|$|A company {{specialized}} in printing technologies, wanted an application {{to monitor the}} <b>smart</b> <b>printers</b> deployed to their customers. The application shall allow the monitoring of: (i) the different states assumed by the printer during a given interval of time; (ii) printing parameters (including velocity, number of prints, and quantity of ink); and (iii) overall equipment effectiveness statistics. The final aim {{of the system is}} to enable predictive maintenance and continuous monitoring of the devices, so as to increase the level of service for the customers.|$|R

The aim of the project is to design and develop {{software}} and a <b>smart</b> fabric <b>printer</b> that can print electronic materials containing inks with interactive capabilities. The consortium consists of three creative partners Diffus Design, Base Structures and Zaha Hadid Architectsand four technical and research based partners University of Southampton, Institut f√ºr Textiltechnik Aachen, Grafixoft and Ardeje.|$|R
5000|$|The 'most popular' ticket machine, Ticketer Large, is {{designed}} for busy urban routes. It is a fixed point solution, with an ITSO-compliant <b>smart</b> card reader, <b>printer</b> and an electronic point of sale machine. [...] This was the original Ticketer system; the other three machines, which differ only in their hardware, were developed by Corvia {{at the request of}} bus operators who had special requirements.|$|R
