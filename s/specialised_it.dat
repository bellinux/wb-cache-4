40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a study of}} the personal social services’ (PSS) organisation and economy as conditions for social workers’ assessments of needs and appropriate interventions. One central aim was to study how different organisation models affect social workers’ client work, especially concerning possibilities to establish supportive relationships with the clients. The study includes all staff in the PSS in three Swedish municipalities (n= 247) with different organisation models: a specialised organisation, an integrated (generic) organisation as well as a combined organisation with elements of both specialisation and integration. Data collection used an on-line survey questionnaire which allowed various types of data, including relatively in-depth qualitative data. Consequently both quantitative and qualitative analysis methods were used. The results reveal significant differences between the studied organisations. Neither the specialised organisation nor the combined one is able to create sufficient economic or organisational conditions for working with clients. This also holds true for assessment of needs and possibilities to make appropriate interventions, such as establishing working alliances. Social workers in the integrated organisation, on the contrary, to a high extent report adequate conditions for assessments of needs and interventions. This organisation hence appears as more advantageous than the combined and the <b>specialised.</b> <b>It</b> is also striking that social workers in the specialised organisation perceive the organisation as not being focused on supportive relationships with clients, and sometimes as a direct obstacle. The specialised organisation is also characterised by substantial workload, social workers’ lack of time for their clients and discontinuity.

40|$|From the biogeographic and biospeleological {{points of}} view, the {{subterranean}} fauna of Sardinia {{is one of}} the most interesting in the Mediterranean area: very rich in taxa, mostly endemic and highly <b>specialised,</b> <b>it</b> is apparently well known and currently investigated. Nevertheless, the amount of unexpected discoveries is still increasing every year. In the present thesis, at first, owing to the general low interest of the public for the protection of invertebrate endemic, troglobitic organisms, we have selected among the endemic vertebrate species protected by European, national and regional laws, those that should be helpful - as “Umbrella Species” – for the conservation of this very important natural heritage. The choice of the genus Speleomantes (Amphibia, Plethodontidae) showed how many endemic organisms could be protected with the conservation of the karst areas where these Amphibians are present (in particular, in Sulcis-Iglesiente and Nuorese areas). The second phase consisted in the study of larval morphology and natural history of some species of troglobitic beetles. Their larvae, in fact, seem to be much more vulnerable than adults to the anthropogenic impact in caves. Finally, the yearly temperature variations in Bue Marino cave (Dorgali, Eastern Sardinia), the most visited show cave in Sardinia, have been monitored with the aim of increasing our knowledge of the touristic impact on subterranean animal species. During the samplings in the field, several troglobitic organisms, new for the Science, or never previously reported from some caves, have been discovered and in part described, showing how scarce is our knowledge of the subterranean Biodiversity in the island, compared with the real potential of the Sardinian karst...|$|E

European Science Foundation Policy Briefing Science communication in Europe As scientific research becomes ever more <b>specialised,</b> <b>it</b> {{is becoming more and more}} difficult to exchange ideas across scientific disciplines. At the same time, scientists need to increasingly develop abilities to communicate their ideas and discoveries not only with each other but with policy makers at all levels and with the public at large.

To do this effectively requires an investment in time, training and resources within an overall communication policy. By comparing and contrasting different approaches in Europe we should be able to develop and implement “best practice ” at both the national and European levels.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of electronic patient records (EPRs) in large hospitals has {{for close to}} two decades been considered {{as a means for}} improving the exploitation of the health care resources. Both at the governmental level, in the hospitals, and in public institutions, there have been arguments about how an EPR should constitute a foundation for efficiency improvement, information systems integration and increased collaboration across departments and hospitals as well as for quality assurance in diagnostic work. The results have so far been disappointing. Despite a series of heavily funded national and international initiatives, there has only been very modest success in establishing working Electronic Patient Records (EPRs) in large hospitals. The present study looks more closely into this phenomenon and seeks to explore and explain why large projects often fail. Subsequently, I seek to suggest conditions and mechanisms for more successfully establishing working EPRs. A large-scale EPR will unquestionably inscribe certain behaviour in organisational practice, which might result in failures caused by rigidity and inflexibility. On the other hand, the EPR might in itself behave in unforeseen ways or be used differently than initially planned, thus posing new challenges for designers. Accordingly, the design and {{implementation of}} large-scale EPRs are not merely a technical effort. Such a process must take into account that large hospitals are very complex organisations. Clinical work is highly <b>specialised.</b> <b>It</b> is characterised by state-of-the-art knowledge, high levels of education, but also by a very complex division of labour. The heterogeneous user-groups and professionals are very often recognised with different agendas and interests Broadly sketched, I address questions related to the organisation of large-scale IT-projects, strategies for integration of EPRs with existing IT-systems in hospitals, and strategies for how to perform standardisation processes. I also look into mechanisms for alternative organisation of work centred on EPRs. In addition, I discuss how the EPR might support collaboration among heterogeneous users in complex and specialised organisations. From a theoretical point of view this study is based on the fields of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Science and Technology Studies in general and Actor Network Theory in particular (ANT). ANT offers an apparatus for describing and conceptualising the relationship between technological and social components. The CSCW literature has focused quite extensively on how an information system can support distributed collaborative work among groups of users. This is an important point related to the use of EPRs because real usefulness can only be achieved if the different professionals in the hospitals share some comprehension of what an EPR should do, and agree to use it in certain ways. The term 'information infrastructures' has been valuable in illustrating the complexity of organisations and IT-systems and how they are mutually intertwined. dr. scient. dr. scient...|$|E

40|$|All {{organisms are}} {{dependent}} upon their habitat for the resources necessary for survival and reproduction, but they vary immensely {{in the degree}} to which they are specialized on particular resources. Habitat specialists appear to evolve in environments where preferred resources are stable, however specialists are vulnerable to extinction should these resources become scarce. Given global declines in the quantity and quality of available habitats, it is critical to understand why species are specialised, and what resources they are specialized on, in order to determine their vulnerability to habitat loss. Coral reefs are home to a diverse assemblage of coral-associated organisms and of these, corallivorous fishes are among the most specialised. One such species, the harlequin filefish, Oxymonacanthus longirostris, is distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific in areas of high coral cover. This study investigated the ecology of O. longirostris to determine how <b>specialised</b> <b>it</b> is, the roles of prey quality and predation pressure as drivers of specialisation, and the consequences of being a coral specialist in light of increasing coral degradation. Most animals consume a narrower range of food resources than is potentially available in the environment. Chapter 2 examined the drivers of this prey selection by testing the consequences of prey preferences for key fitness-related parameters. While the diet of O. longirostris was dominated by the most abundant coral species, Acropora nobilis, fish appeared to preferentially feed on rarer acroporids, such as Acropora millepora. Choice experiments confirmed strong preferences for these rarer corals, suggesting diet is constrained by availability of different coral species. In a feeding experiment, reproductive pairs fed on non-preferred corals exhibited dramatic declines in condition and reproductive output compared with those fed preferred corals. These experiments suggest that fish distinguish between available corals based on their intrinsic value as prey, that reproductive success is dependent on the presence of particular coral species, and that differential loss of preferred corals could have significant consequences for population success. Foraging theory predicts that preferred prey should maximise energetic reward relative to the energy expended to access, capture, and consume prey. However, the relative roles of differences in the nutritive value of prey and costs associated with differences in prey accessibility are not always clear. Chapter 3 investigated within-colony feeding in O. longirostris to establish if prey accessibility determines foraging patterns. O. longirostris exhibited non-uniform patterns of foraging in the field, feeding midway along branches. On simulated corals, fish replicated this pattern when food accessibility was equal along the branch. However, when food access varied, fish consistently modified their foraging behaviour, feeding where food was most accessible. When foraging patterns were compared with coral morphology, fish preferred larger polyps and less skeletal protection. Consequently, it appears that patterns of prey selectivity are influenced by coral morphology, with fish preferring corals with structural characteristics that increase prey accessibility. A selective coral diet may further benefit O. longirostris by reducing predation risk. Many organisms primarily interact with their surroundings using non-visual sensory systems and may have evolved mechanisms to 'blend in' with chemical components of their habitat. One potential mechanism of camouflage is through the sequestering of dietary elements, causing a consumers odour to chemically match the odour of its prey. Chapter 4 tested for diet-induced chemical crypsis in O. longirostris by using the olfactory preferences of coral-obligate crabs to determine the effect of coral diet on fish odour. Crabs strongly preferred the odour of filefish fed their normal coral host, suggesting coral-specific dietary elements that influence odour are sequestered. In behavioural trials, predatory cod were less attracted to filefish odour presented alongside the coral it had been feeding on, suggesting reduced detectability. This evidence suggests that a close coupling between diet and habitat can form an effective antipredator strategy. Many animals select a habitat from the range of those available, driven by factors such as food quality or shelter availability, and these preferences may have consequences for the distribution and abundance of populations. Chapter 5 examined how the distribution and abundance of O. longirostris relates to coral architecture and diversity. The main drivers of distribution and abundance among reefs were coral species richness and availability of branching coral. Feeding territories had a higher percentage of Acropora coral than surrounding habitat. In addition, feeding territories had a higher percentage of the structurally important branching coral, A. nobilis, and the preferred prey species, A. millepora. Pair-wise choice experiments in which both structural complexity and coral tissue quality were independently manipulated showed that habitat choice was primarily based on shelter characteristics. These results suggest species-diverse coral habitats, which provide structural complexity along with nutritionally important prey, may be essential for population persistence. While extinctions of marine species are infrequent, local extinctions are becoming common. Yet, the role of habitat degradation and resource specialisation in explaining local extinction is still poorly understood. On coral reefs, coral bleaching is an increasingly frequent cause of coral mortality that can result in dramatic changes to coral community composition. Chapter 6 documents the local extinction of O. longirostris following a mass bleaching event. Local extinction occurred on reefs that lost all colonies of the key prey species, A. millepora, even though overall coral cover remained high. In an experimental test, fish continued to select bleached A. millepora over non-preferred species, irrespective of their condition. These results suggest that behavioural inflexibility may limit the ability of specialists to cope with even subtle changes to resource availability. This study demonstrates that O. longirostris is a highly specialised species that has evolved precise behavioural mechanisms to exploit the corals with which it associates. Its reliance on a relatively limited suite of corals leaves it highly vulnerable to climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances that threaten to reduce coral cover and abundance. This study also highlights how variable corals can be with regards to their value as prey and habitat. It appears that habitats that contain a specific combination of corals may be necessary for the survival and persistence of O. longirostris. When assessing the vulnerability of such highly specialised species, it is important to understand and evaluate the full range of their critical resources...|$|E
