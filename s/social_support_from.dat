Beginning in the later part of 1944, following the defeat of the Warsaw Uprising and the promotion of the populist program of the PKWN, the London exiled government's delegation was increasingly seen by the majority of Poles as a failed enterprise, its political-military organizations became isolated, and the resistance against the new communist political and administrative forces decisively weakened. The population was tired of the years of oppression and conflict and the ideas expressed in the PKWN Manifesto and their progressive implementation attracted widening <b>social</b> <b>support.</b> <b>From</b> 1944 in liberated areas, responding to promulgated slogans, workers spontaneously took over existing factory installations, established workers' councils, undertook reconstruction, activation and production. A considerable labor struggle and compulsion were necessary for the PPR to claim the factories and enforce its own rules.|$|E

25|$|While some {{research}} indicates that psychological resilience is a relatively stable personality trait, new research suggests that positive emotions are critical to trait resilience. This {{is not to say}} that positive emotions are merely a by-product of resilience, but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual. Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources. <b>Social</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> caring adults encouraged resilience among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities.|$|E

25|$|Fostering {{resilience}} {{in children}} requires family environments that are caring and stable, hold {{high expectations for}} children’s behavior and encourage participation {{in the life of}} the family. Most resilient children have a strong relationship with at least one adult, not always a parent, and this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord. The definition of parental resilience, as the capacity of parents to deliver a competent and quality level of parenting to children, despite the presence of risk factors, has proven to be a very important role in children's resilience. Understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental resilience. Even if divorce produces stress, the availability of <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes. Any family that emphasizes the value of assigned chores, caring for brothers or sisters, and the contribution of part-time work in supporting the family helps to foster resilience. Resilience research has traditionally focused on the well being of children, with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the resilience of parents.|$|E
2500|$|Later, Vanita {{condenses}} {{the ideas}} {{in her book}} into an article, [...] "Same-sex Weddings, Hindu Traditions and Modern India". Here, she summarizes specific cases in which women specifically committed joint-suicides, were married and separated, or successfully married. She points out three different [...] "forces that have helped female couples". These are: the law courts, the media, and some Hindu authorities (such as the swamis mentioned earlier in this article) from her book. [...] When female couples can stay together under the social pressures {{and get to the}} courts, the courts generally hold up their decisions, holding {{to the fact that the}} women are consenting adults. While this does not necessarily stop the harassment, it does lend the couple further legitimacy under the laws. In addition, the more successful same-sex marriages of women are those in which the women are financially independent. If they have <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> their families and community—for the most part—then they may be able to live in peace together. The media may also play an important role in same-sex marriages. In drawing attention to their marriages, women who do not necessarily know about LGBT rights groups may be contacted and supported by those groups after media attention. However, the flip side of this is that the anti-LGBT groups also may reach out against their marriage.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the factors affecting the stages of exercise behaviors changes of low back pain patients. Methods: The participants in this study were 220 low back pain patients who have been treated by therapeutic exercise or had the exercise treatment under the doctor's advice. The tools used for this study were the stages of exercise behavior change, intrinsic motivation questionnaires, and physical activity <b>social</b> <b>support</b> scale (PASS). Results: The group that did exercise (preparation stage, maintenance stage, action stage) was 75. 9 % but the group that did not exercise (precontemplation stage, contemplation stage) was 24. 1 %. <b>Social</b> <b>supports</b> <b>from</b> family members and friends and motivation affected the exercise behaviors changes. And 34. 6 % of the exercise behavior change can be explained by the <b>social</b> <b>support</b> (family, friend) and motivation. Conclusion: There were two recommendations for maintaining the exercise behaviors of low back pain patients based on theo-retical background. First, we recommended more exercise programs which reinforce <b>social</b> <b>supports</b> <b>from</b> family and friend for constant exercise behaviors of low back pain patients.

Individuals with high (N = 105) and low (N = 194) social anxiety completed measures of perceived <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> perceived <b>social</b> <b>support</b> derived <b>from</b> Facebook, and subjective well-being. For the high social anxiety group, Facebook <b>social</b> <b>support</b> explained a significant amount of additional variance in subjective well-being, with offline <b>social</b> <b>support</b> failing to contribute significantly to the model.

40|$|The present article {{describes}} preliminary {{results of a}} study that aims to analyse the relationship among Portuguese adolescent perception of parental styles, <b>social</b> <b>support</b> received <b>from</b> family and peers and their school behaviour. Participants were 537 adolescents aged between 14 and 16. The “Parental Author- ity Questionnaire”, the “Perceived Social Support-Friends Scale” and “Perceived Social Support-Family Scale” were used to measure adolescent perceptions. Overall, Portuguese adolescents perceive their par-ents as using predominantly a democratic parental style. Associations between school behaviour and pa-rental styles show that “well-behaved” adolescents perceive their parents as less permissive. On the other hand, adolescents who misbehave perceive their parents as more permissive and authoritarian. As regards the relationship between perceived school behaviour and <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> adolescents recognise receiving greater <b>support</b> <b>from</b> peers than from family, and adolescents who “often behave badly” are those who re-fer to receiving less <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> either <b>from</b> the family or peers...|$|R

There is increasing evidence that emotional distress is an occupational hazard for physicians. Measures exploring the relationships between occupational stress, <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> locus of control, and depression were administered to a group of 210 family physicians. The results indicated that occupational stress exerted a direct effect on depression. This relationship was moderated directly by family <b>social</b> and emotional <b>support</b> and indirectly by the influence of locus of control on family <b>social</b> <b>support.</b> <b>Support</b> <b>from</b> peers was not significantly related to depression. The findings suggest that individuals with a strong sense of personal control also possess beneficial support systems in the presence of stressful situations.
