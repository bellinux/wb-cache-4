40|$|This applied {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the opinions and perceptions of classroom teachers and school administrators toward <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> in an urban religious school located in the mid-Atlantic United States. The researcher also investigated how these opinions and perceptions impacted the school’s culture and students’ learning abilities. The theoretical framework of the study was based on the social cognitive theory, which is based on the reciprocal causality that a strong sense of collective efficacy enhances teachers’ selfefficacy beliefs, whereas weak collective efficacy beliefs undermine teachers’ sense of efficacy and vice versa. Self-efficacy and collective efficacy shape the normative school environment in which teachers work and students can perform. Three research questions guided the present study: How do opinions or perceptions of <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> from classroom teachers, school administrators, and district personnel affect the substitute teaching process and student learning continuity? What methods of collaboration and strategies can classroom teachers, school administrators, and district personnel use to enhance substitute teachers’ efficacy? How could the professional development of <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> improve instruction? This study used a qualitative approach that involved surveys and interviews as instruments to collect data. The study sample consisted of available regular classroom <b>teachers,</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers,</b> and administrators from the research site. Traditional methods were used to analyze and synthesize the collected data. The validity of the findings was ensured through member checking, peer review, and triangulation. Findings revealed that the leadership at the target institution has a philosophy and practice of integrated and comprehensive services both for <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> and regular staff in the school system. Therefore, the general opinions and perceptions of the school administrators, classroom <b>teachers,</b> and <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> about <b>substitute</b> teaching remain positive. That means <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> are fully integrated into the target school system. Relationships between permanent staff members and substitutes also remain positive in that institution. The productive teaching and learning process takes place when <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> are in charge of the classrooms and their contributions positively impact the students continuing learning. These outcomes may contribute to the improvement of the views and practices of education policy makers, school leaders, classroom teachers, curriculum department, support staff, students, parents, community members, and school partners about <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> and integrate their value into the school system toward the learning continuity of students...|$|R
40|$|Problem: Studies {{indicated}} {{that the presence of}} <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> who are deficient in classroom management skills can be a deterrent to the educational continuity of the students. Due to increasing amounts of negotiated sick leave and compensated time for professional development, teachers are spending more time out of the classroom. Thus, {{there is a need for}} <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> to be better prepared to carry on the educational process. However, in New Jersey, there is no provision for training this segment of staff, either through the county, the state, or educational institutions. In a effort to improve the current skills of <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers,</b> this study tested and evaluated a model hypertext computer-based training program that was designed to better prepare <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> for their classroom responsibilities. Procedure: In the first phase of the study, a hypertext CBT program was developed to (a) increase knowledge of classroom management, (b) provide a cost-effective solution to expensive training, and (c) administer training without constraints of time or staff. The second phase of the study field-tested the program using a modified quasi-experimental version of a non-equivalent control group design. Employing a multiple-choice instrument, the experimental group (new <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers)</b> used a pretest, application, posttest design to determine if computer-based training could increase their current level of knowledge. Control group I (experienced substitutes), and control group 2 (experienced teachers) used a posttest-only design to determine benchmarks for the study. Results: (1) Comparison between the experimental group 2 ̆ 7 s pretest score (60. 25) and control group I 2 ̆ 7 s posttest-only score (59. 25) indicated no difference in these groups 2 ̆ 7 knowledge, suggesting knowledge of classroom management techniques was not necessarily gained with experience. (2) The analysis of the pretest (60. 25) and posttest (78. 50) scores of the experimental group indicated the CBT program produced the desired results, at the. 05 level of significance. (3) The posttest-only knowledge-based test administer to control group 2 (85. 50) supported this author 2 ̆ 7 s expectations that experienced teachers would score significantly higher than either the new <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 pretest scores or the experienced <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 posttest scores. (4) After the application of CBT, there was no significant difference between the knowledge of classroom management techniques of the CBT trained <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> and experienced teachers. Conclusion: The conclusions of this study are: (I) as demonstrated through the results, the hypertext CBT program created and tested for this study shows a significant increase in <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of classroom management. (2) All <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> needed training regardless of experience. (3) The CBT program was successful under the conditions of the study. And (4), further research is needed to determine if the knowledge gained through this program can be transferred into the classroom. Conclusion: The conclusions of this study are: (I) as demonstrated through the results, the hypertext CBT program created and tested for this study shows a significant increase in <b>substitute</b> <b>teachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of classroom management.
