50|$|Due to {{the change}} of axles, the 4x4 LTs came with {{completely}} different wheel rims to standard LTs. All 4x4 LTs have 6 <b>stud</b> <b>tube</b> type split-rims in 6.5J width. The standard tyre fitment on these rims is 7.00x16 or 7.50x16. The biggest tyre that these rims will take is 9.00x16 (or 255/100/16), which will give another 6 cm of ground clearance, but that will require arch modifications in the front. Mefro has a 16x8J ET0 rim in their portfolio, that will fit the 4x4 LT, but these can't be bought directly. Owners have managed {{to get hold of}} these rims over a group buy. The Mefro rims will then allow to run 285/75/16 tyres on the 4x4 LT.|$|E
50|$|Cobi is a Polish toy {{company with}} its {{headquarters}} in Warsaw, Poland. Cobi's most prominent toys are building blocks with an interlocking <b>stud</b> and <b>tube</b> system similar to Lego blocks. Cobi blocks are sold primarily in Poland and central Europe.|$|R
50|$|The blocks {{were of a}} {{very similar}} grid pattern to the LEGO system, but due to {{existing}} LEGO patents, were slightly different. Rather than using a <b>stud</b> and <b>tube</b> system, Loc Blocs used a tall stud and short channels {{on the bottom of}} bricks. The tall studs were just tall enough to engage the channels. The knobs were too tall and spaced just a little bit off for fitting between LEGO tubes.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} pairs of shoes, one {{of which had been}} made in 1938 and the other in 1939. There was a mineral water bottle of a type {{supplied}} to hotels in Morecambe, Lancaster and Ingleton, and containing a blue 'crown' top not introduced until 1940. Other items found with the man included a wristlet watch, handkerchief, shaving <b>tube,</b> <b>studs,</b> toothbrush, fountain pen, propelling pencil, compass, box of matches, tablets, flashlamp, and toiletries. The man had a key but the police were unable to identify the lock which it opened.|$|R
