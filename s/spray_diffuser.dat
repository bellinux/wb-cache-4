50|$|Artwork media {{requiring}} fixative include drawings done in pencil, charcoal, and pastel. An artist {{will often}} fix layers {{of a work}} in progress, in order to easily add further layers. Such a technique requires a workable fixative. Fixative is most commonly available in aerosol sprays. Fixative can also come in a liquid form {{that can be used}} from the bottle via a manual <b>spray</b> <b>diffuser.</b> This form is better for one's lungs and has less of an impact on the environment.|$|E

Gold inner {{compartment}} with <b>spray</b> <b>diffuser.</b> Impressed on base : Eau de Toilette No 5 Chanel Paris 50 ml 80 % vol 17 fl oz [...] Date: 2000 - 2005 - from the The Betty Smithers Design Collection at Staffordshire University. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a sprinkler head for fire extinguishing systems, said sprinkling head having a lock, a seal, a strike {{head and a}} trigger device whereby the lock also assumes {{the function of the}} <b>spray</b> <b>diffuser.</b> In the event of a fire, a trigger device is provided comprising a trigger element produced from a shape memory alloy and provided with two legs which move towards or away from each other {{in the event of a}} temperature increase. Furthermore, a rounded expanded outlet and a sprinkler diffuser for distributing the extinguishing water are provided in the sprinkler head...|$|E
40|$|Surface aerators {{are used}} as {{temporary}} and permanent systems to add oxygen to and remove nitrogen gas from hatchery waters. Rates of gas transfer across a water-gas boundary are greater for an oxygen-enriched atmosphere than for air. We compared an enclosed agitator, a pumped <b>spray,</b> and <b>diffusers</b> (airstones) with respect to oxygen absorption efficiency and nitrogen stripping over a range of influent gas (oxygen or air) flow rates. Results indicate the enclosed agitator, receiving oxygen, {{can be used as}} a low-cost, portable oxygenation and degassing system...|$|R
40|$|Everyday {{life can}} no longer be {{imagined}} without fragrances and scented products. For the consumer, countless products exists which are solely or partly intended to give off a certain scent in sufficient concentrations to odorize a complete room. <b>Sprays,</b> <b>diffusers</b> and evaporators, scented candles and automatic devices for the distribution of fragrance liquids are typical examples of such products. If the consumer uses such products, his consent to the release of certain chemicals in his home can be implied, however, he may not know what kind of fragrance substances and solvents will be present in which concentrations. In this study, we determined the volatile emissions of a number of fragrance products in detail. Measurements were carried out under controlled conditions in test chambers. The products were tested in a passive (unused) and an active state, wherever applicable. Following a defined test protocol, the release of volatile organic compounds, ultrafine particles and NO x was monitored for each product. The potential for forming secondary organic aerosols under the influence of ozone was studied, and for a selection of products the long-term emission behavior was assessed. A remarkable variety of fragrance substances was found and more than 100 relevant compounds were identified and quantified. While it is the intended function of such products to release fragrance substances, also considerable amounts of non-odorous solvents and by-products were found to be released from several air fresheners. Emissions rates exceeding 2 mg/(unit*h) were measured for the five most common solvents...|$|R
40|$|A trade {{study of}} the {{feasibility}} of conducting J- 2 X testing in the Glenn Research Center (GRC) Plum Brook Station (PBS) B- 2 facility was initiated in May 2006 with results available in October 2006. The Propulsion Test Integration Group (PTIG) led the study with support from Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and Jacobs Sverdrup Engineering. The primary focus of the trade study was on facility design concepts and their capability to satisfy the J- 2 X altitude simulation test requirements. The propulsion systems tested in the B- 2 facility were in the 30, 000 -pound (30 K) thrust class. The J- 2 X thrust is approximately 10 times larger. Therefore, concepts {{significantly different from the}} current configuration are necessary for the <b>diffuser,</b> <b>spray</b> chamber subsystems, and cooling water. Steam exhaust condensation in the spray chamber is judged to be the key risk consideration relative to acceptable spray chamber pressure. Further assessment via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and other simulation capabilities (e. g. methodology for anchoring predictions with actual test data and subscale testing to support investigation...|$|R
