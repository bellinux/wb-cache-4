25|$|A {{table saw}} or <b>sawbench</b> is a {{woodworking}} tool, {{consisting of a}} circular saw blade, mounted on an arbor, that is driven by an electric motor (either directly, by belt, or by gears). The blade protrudes through {{the surface of a}} table, which provides support for the material, usually wood, being cut.|$|E
50|$|The Lahey family {{emigrated from}} their native Ireland to Australia in 1862. Francis Lahey, {{his wife and}} eleven {{children}} arrived in Sydney, but immediately travelled north to Brisbane. The family began farming in the Pimpama region in 1870. In 1875 Francis Lahey purchased a sugar mill and <b>sawbench</b> at Tygum, Waterford for his sons.|$|E
50|$|It was {{converted}} to a sawmill around 1879. The waterwheel was removed and replaced with a Thomson double-vortex turbine, built by Williamsons (now Gilbert Gilkes & Gordon Ltd) of Kendal. This {{is thought to be}} the only remaining working variety of its type. In its heydey, the 10 hp (7.46 kW) created by the turbine drove a range of woodworking machinery - a rack <b>sawbench,</b> circular saw, thicknesser (planer), and lathes - by a series of belts and pulleys off a central line shaft.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of flood {{damage to}} a culvert along Devonshire Avenue in the San Fernando Valley, 1935. At center, a large, muddy crevice is visible {{at the side of}} the road above and behind it. Automobiles {{traverse}} the road, and at the road's rightmost area, men can be seen peering over the far side, while <b>sawbenches</b> stand to block a portion of the guard rail that has been washed-out. A gently rolling hill is visible in the background. The road was fifteen hundred feet west of Reseda Avenue. This image taken prior to the construction of a bridge...|$|R
50|$|Adverts for Hewlett and Blondeau {{engines and}} <b>sawbenches</b> {{appeared}} in the Luton News during late 1919 with the last advertisement being on the 12 February 1920. A {{decision was made to}} close the works and Fuller, Horley and Son & Cassell of London arranged a six-day sale of the site and contents of the factory starting on Tuesday 19 October 1920. The 8 acre site with 110000 sq ft of buildings failed to reach the second asking bid of Â£50,000 and went for private treaty, eventually being sold to Electrolux and forming part of the then new Electrolux factory where some of the original buildings remain to this day. Much of the site was redeveloped in the 1990s and early 2000s into residential housing.|$|R
50|$|Then, he was {{strapped}} onto a board, {{and placed}} upon a <b>sawbench,</b> {{his arms and}} legs fastened. The executioners team then sought to start by sawing him from the head downwards, but Boucasra's sons intervened, and demanded that one began between Melec's legs instead, because otherwise, he would die too quickly. Under the terrible screams of Melec and his relatives, thus began his execution. Once they had sawed him up to the navel, they pulled out the saw in order to commence from the other side. Melec {{is said to have been}} still conscious, asking for some water. His friends, though, thought it best to hasten his demise and shorten his sufferings, and the executioners went on, sawing him from skull to navel so he fell apart. In the process, chunks of flesh were ripped out by the saw's teeth, causing blood to splatter everywhere, thus making the execution quite unbearable to watch.|$|E
5000|$|Economically, the Queensland {{government}} {{supported the}} view advocated by Meston {{that the first}} duty of reserves was [...] "that they be self- supporting institutions". The labour of inmates as directed by the Superintendent focussed on grazing and agricultural production. Ringbarking and vegetation clearing, fencing, prickly pear cutting and tending to stock (initially sheep for wool and later beef cattle) were ongoing tasks throughout {{the life of the}} reserve. A range of crops were grown with varying degrees of success, with the reserve vulnerable to the extremes of flooding and droughts. Crops included cotton, potatoes, pumpkins, corn and melons, and stock fodder. An orchard of seven acres had been established by 1918 with 500 citrus trees. Between 1918 and 1922 another 9 acres (3.64 ha) is thought to have been used for orchard purposes and other fruits were grown. A 260 ft (79.25m) bore, capped by a windmill and connected to pipelines, tanks and stock troughs was sunk near the orchard for the reserve's water needs in 1916. The water's excessive iron content meant that it could not be used as effectively as hoped. Other infrastructure known to have been constructed included extensive fencing, horse yards, a woolshed in 1913, dams, a butcher's shop, new yards and a dip in 1919, a milling shed for a small <b>sawbench</b> and engine, and a bridge over the Dawson River.|$|E
40|$|The Analytical Development Section of Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) was {{requested}} by the Facilities Disposition Projects (FDP) to determine the holdup of enriched uranium in the 321 -M facility {{as part of an}} overall deactivation project of the facility. The 321 -M facility was used to fabricate enriched uranium fuel assemblies, lithium-aluminum target tubes, neptunium assemblies, and miscellaneous components for the production reactors. The results of the holdup assays are essential for determining compliance with the Waste Acceptance Criteria, Material Control & Accountability, and to meet criticality safety controls. This report covers holdup measurements on two <b>sawbench</b> components that were used for cutting U-Al fuel rods. The benches contained U-Al residue scattered on the bench tops and bagged up in plastic containers. It was very important to obtain an estimate of the HEU content of this residue in order to remove criticality concerns before vacuuming it into a much smaller volume. A portable high purity germanium (HPGe) detection system and a portable sodium iodide (NaI) detection system were used to determine highly enriched uranium (HEU) holdup and to determine holdup Np- 237 and Am- 241 that were observed in these components. The measured Np- 237 and Am- 241 contents were especially important in these components because their presence is unusual and unexpected in 321 -M. It was important to obtain a measured value of these two components to disposition the saw benches and to determine whether a separate waste stream was necessary for release of these contaminated components to the E-Area Solid Waste Vault. The reported values for Np- 237 are < 0. 8 mg on each of the two bench tops and < 3 {micro}g in the bag of chips. The reported values for Am- 241 are < 500 ng on the two bench tops and < 15 ng in the bag of chips. Our results demonstrate an upper limit of {sup 235 }U content of 0. 4 g on the two benchtops and of 0. 1 mg in the bag of chips. These reported values completely eliminated the criticality concerns. This report discusses the methodology, non-destructive assay (NDA) measurements, and results of the holdup measured {{for each of the three}} actinide species in these saw benches...|$|E
