40|$|The initial {{part of the}} {{ejaculatory}} duct of Orchesella villosa contains a “valve” and a “sorter” avoiding respectively the reflow and allowing {{the separation of the}} secretion for the spermatophore stalk from the <b>sperm</b> <b>fluid.</b> For most of its length, the {{ejaculatory duct}} lumen is divided into two parts: in the dorsal part the <b>sperm</b> <b>fluid</b> flows while in the ventral district the secretion for the stalk occurs. Laterally, {{on both sides of the}} duct, longitudinal muscle fibers are present. The epithelium of the dorsal region consists of two types of long secretory cells; the most peculiar of them are those provided with extracellular cisterns flowing directly into the duct lumen as it occurs in 1 st type of epidermal cells. These cells could be involved in the control of the viscosity of the <b>sperm</b> <b>fluid.</b> The second type of cells produce a secretion probably involved in the formation of the outer coat of the apical sperm droplet. The ventral epithelium consists of short cells contributing to the enrichment of the secretion for the spermatophore stalk and perhaps also to the viscosity of the secretion flowing in the lumen. In the distal part of the ejaculatory duct, the ventral district is provided with a thick layer of muscle fibers and with 3 + 3 cuticular laminae dividing the lumen into a series of slits through which the secretion of the stalk is squeezed out into filaments. This organization allows the twisting and hardening of these filaments. A drop of <b>sperm</b> <b>fluid</b> is laid on top of the long and rigid spermatophore stalk...|$|E
40|$|Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and BKV, JCV, and SV 40 polyomaviruses (PYVs) are oncogenic viruses {{associated}} with different human tumors. Our {{aim was to}} determine if PYV and HPV sequences could be detected in human genital tumors. HPV types 6 b, 11, 16, and 18 and PYV were investigated in 22 genital tumor samples and the corresponding adjacent normal tissues, by PCR and filter hybridization. HPV and PYV sequences were also searched in six <b>sperm</b> <b>fluid</b> and four peripheral blood cell (PBC) samples. HPV- 16 sequences were revealed in 7 of 14 cervical tumors and 1 of 1 vaginal adenocarcinoma, whereas 1 of 14 cervical carcinoma tested positive for HPV- 18. Interestingly, each normal cervical tissue surrounding the neoplasm obtained from the same patient was positive for HPV type- 16 and - 18 with the same prevalence detected in tumors. BKV sequences were found in 9 of 14 cervical tumors, 1 of 7 vulvar tumors, and 1 of 1 adenocarcinoma, but also in normal tissues from cervix (13 of 14), vulva (6 of 7), <b>sperm</b> <b>fluid</b> (5 of 6) and PBC (3 of 4) samples. SV 40 sequences were detected in 1 of 14 normal cervical tissue, 2 of 6 sperm fluids and 1 of 4 PBCs. None of the samples were JCV positive. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation reporting on the simultaneous association of both HPV and PYV with human genital tumors. These results suggest that PYV, together with HPV, may be involved as a cofactor in the onset/progression of human genital tumors, and raise the possibility that PYV act synergistically with HPV to enhance their pathogenicity in vivo. In addition, HPV and PYV may complement each other in infecting human genital tissues...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian {{spermatozoa}} {{after their}} development in testis undergo the post-testicular maturation in epididymis where acquire their fertilization ability and competence of movement. The epididymis is tissue with very active fluid-absorbing and fluid-secreting activity. Epididymal fluid contains ions and small molecules, proteins, glycoproteins and enzymes. The surface of spermatozoa is exposed {{directly to the}} epididymal fluid, and the sperm plasma membrane is significantly changed. Some testicular proteins are altered, masked, or replaced by new proteins/glycoproteins of epididymal origin. Several proteins produced by epididymis have been described in various mammalian species and shown {{to be associated with}} spermatozoa suggesting a role in the sperm maturation and/or sperm-egg binding and fusion. We isolated proteins from fluid, tissue and sperm of boar epididymis, and separated them by chromatographic and electrophoretic methods. We searched for known proteins using panel of antibodies and tested proteins of epididymal fluid for binding abilities. In the epididymis, we found proteins described as proteins of seminal plasma and associated with the sperm surface, such as spermadhesins, beta-microseminoprotein and acrosin inhibitor. These proteins were detected in epididymal <b>sperm,</b> <b>fluid</b> and tissue. We showed that some epididymal proteins may bind the spermatozoa and change the binding sites on the sperm surface. We determined and identified some proteins from boar epididymal fluid with affinity to heparin, hyaluronan and zona pellucida glycoproteins. These phenomena indicate that epididymal fluid proteins bind to the sperm surface during epididymal maturation and might subsequently play role in the sperm capacitation or sperm-zona pellucida binding...|$|E

40|$|Sexual selection, {{differences}} in reproductive success between individuals, continues beyond acquiring a mating partner and affects ejaculate size and composition (sperm competition). <b>Sperm</b> and seminal <b>fluid</b> {{have very different}} roles in sperm competition but both components encompass production costs for the male. Theoretical models predict that males should spend ejaculate components prudently and differently for <b>sperm</b> and seminal <b>fluid</b> but empirical evidence for independent variation of sperm number and seminal fluid volume is scarce. It is also largely unknown how <b>sperm</b> and seminal <b>fluid</b> variation affect future mating rate. In bedbugs we developed a protocol to examine the role of seminal fluids in ejaculate allocation {{and its effect on}} future male mating rate. Using age-related changes in <b>sperm</b> and seminal <b>fluid</b> volume we estimated the lowest capacity at which mating activity started. We then showed that sexually active males allocate 12 % of their sperm and 19 % of their seminal fluid volume per mating and predicted that males would be depleted of seminal fluid but not of sperm. We tested (and confirmed) this prediction empirically. Finally, the slightly faster replenishment of seminal <b>fluid</b> compared to <b>sperm</b> did not outweigh the faster decrease during mating. Our results suggest that male mating rate can be constrained by the availability of seminal fluids. Our protocol might be applicable to a range of other organisms.

40|$|Seminal fluid {{often makes}} {{up a large}} part of an ejaculate, yet most {{empirical}} and theoretical studies on sperm competition have focused on how sperm characteristics (number and quality) affect fertilization success. However, seminal <b>fluid</b> influences own <b>sperm</b> performance and may potentially influence the outcome of sperm competition, by also affecting that of rivals. As a consequence males may be expected to allocate their investment in both <b>sperm</b> and seminal <b>fluid</b> in relation to the potential level of competition. Grass goby (Zosterisessor ophiocephalus) is an external fertilizer with guardsneaker mating tactics, where sperm competition risk varies according to the tactic adopted. Here, we experimentally manipulated grass goby ejaculates by separately combining <b>sperm</b> and seminal <b>fluid</b> from territorial and sneaker males. While sperm of sneaker and territorial males did not differ in their performance when they interacted with their own seminal <b>fluid</b> only, <b>sperm</b> of sneakers increased their velocity and fertilization rate in the presence of territorial males’ seminal fluid. By contrast, sneaker males’ seminal fluid had a detrimental effect on the performance of territorial males’ sperm. Sperm velocity was unaffected by the seminal fluid of males employing the same tactic, suggesting that seminal fluid’s effect on rival-tactic sperm is not based on a self/non-self recognition mechanism. Our findings show that cross interactions of <b>sperm</b> and seminal <b>fluid</b> may influence the fertilization success of competing ejaculates with males investing in both <b>sperm</b> and seminal <b>fluid</b> in response to sperm competition risk...|$|R

The present study deals with anesthetic induction, characterization of <b>sperm</b> <b>fluid,</b> cooling and freezing of sperm of the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus. In {{the first chapter}} the natural anesthetics menthol and eugenol were tested in adult specimens aiming to determine the ideal concentration for handling the Nile tilapia. In the second chapter the <b>sperm</b> <b>fluid</b> of the Nile tilapia was characterized according to the following parameters: collected volume, which showed the feasibility of collect in sufficient volume without the need of sacrificing the fish; sperm concentration, which showed significant variation between specimens; pH and osmolarity, which confirm the information of the literature; sperm motility time, which proved that the spermatozoa of tilapia are differentiated concerning accumulated energy {{when compared to other}} freshwater species; and sperm head morphometry, characterized by size (length, width, perimeter and area) and head shape (ellipticity, rugosity, elongation and regularity). In the third chapter we evaluated the feasibility of preservation of tilapia sperm using different extenders and cooled at 4 ÂC. The sperm motility rate was evaluated with the aid of the Computer-assisted Sperm Analyzer (CASA) System. In this, the ACP- 104, media based on powdered coconut water, showed best sperm motility rate for up to 72 hours after storage. In the fourth chapter was evaluated the effects of different cryoprotectants on the post-thaw Nile tilapia sperm, using the software Sperm Class Analyzer (SCA).

40|$|AbstractIntroductionMoxibustion is {{commonly}} used as a traditional Chinese medicine treatment. The aim was to investigate how the exposure of moxa smoke influences sperm parameters, testis index and serum sex hormones in Wistar male rats. Methods 48 Wistar rats were randomly assigned, n= 12 /group, to a control group or one of three moxa-smoke groups: M 1 (low concentration, 0. 4 % of optical density), M 2 (middle concentration, 2 %) and M 3 (high concentration, 15 %). Rats in moxa smoke groups were exposed at the respective concentrations of M 1 (0. 4 % of optical density), M 2 (2 %) and M 3 (15 %) for 12 weeks, at 5 days per week and 200 min per day. Dynamic analyses of <b>sperm</b> <b>fluid</b> {{were used to determine}} sperm concentration, progressive motility, sperm motility, linearity (LIN), wobble (WOB), straightness (STR), velocity of curved line (VCL), velocity of straight line (VSL) and velocity of average path (VAP). The testis index (TI) was measured, and serum sex hormones were determined by using ELISA. ResultsAt the end of 12 weeks of treatment, when the control group was compared with the moxa-smoke groups, the moxa-smoke groups exhibited the following results: sperm concentrations were significantly higher in groups M 1 and M 3 (p= 0. 013), progressive motility was significantly higher in M 1 (p= 0. 006), and sperm motility was significantly higher in groups M 1, M 2 and M 3 (M 1, p= 0. 003; M 2, p= 0. 044; M 3, p= 0. 008). Compared to the control group, TI was also significantly higher in groups M 1, M 2 and M 3 (M 1, p= 0. 004; M 2, p= 0. 003; M 3, p= 0. 002), as were serum total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT) and testosterone secreting index (TSI), respectively (TT, p= 0. 000; FT, TSI, p= 0. 001). Compared to M 1, TT was significantly lower in groups M 2 and M 3 (M 2, p= 0. 021; M 3, P= 0. 001). The comparison of LIN, WOB, STR, VCL, VSL and VAP between groups showed no significant differences. ConclusionAs compared to the non-moxa-smoke control group, low, middle and high concentrations of moxa smoke are effective to improve the male reproductive system in Wistar rats. More specifically, low moxa-smoke concentration seems slightly better than high concentrations for improving the sperm concentrations, progressive motility and sperm motility, TI, TT, FT, TSI of Wistar rats...|$|E

40|$|Background: Ejaculates {{contain a}} diverse mixture of <b>sperm</b> and seminal <b>fluid</b> proteins, the {{combination}} of which is crucial to male reproductive success under competitive conditions. Males should therefore tailor the production of different ejaculate components according to their social environment, with particular sensitivity to cues of sperm competition risk (i. e. how {{likely it is that}} females will mate promiscuously). Here we test this hypothesis using an established vertebrate model system, the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus), combining experimental data with a quantitative proteomics analysis of seminal fluid composition. Our study tests for the first time how both <b>sperm</b> and seminal <b>fluid</b> components of the ejaculate are tailored to the social environment. Results: Our quantitative proteomics analysis reveals that the relative production of different proteins found in seminal fluid – i. e. seminal fluid proteome composition – differs significantly according to cues of sperm competition risk. Using a conservative analytical approach to identify differential expression of individual seminal fluid components, at least seven of 31 secreted seminal fluid proteins examined showed consistent differences in relative abundance under high versus low sperm competition conditions. Notably three important proteins with potential roles in sperm competition – SVS 6, SVS 5 and CEACAM 10 – were more abundant in the high competition treatment groups.

Simultaneous hermaphrodites offer a unique opportunity to determine such costs, since both genders are expressed concurrently. By limiting copulation of focal individuals in pairs of pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis) to either the male role or the female role, we were able to compare the fecundity of single sex individuals with paired hermaphrodites and non-copulants. Additionally, we examined the investment in <b>sperm</b> and seminal <b>fluid</b> of donors towards feminized snails and hermaphrodites. Results Compared to non-mating focal snails, reciprocating individuals as well as male and female copulants experienced a significant fecundity reduction (~ 40 %) after, on average, 3. 07 ± 0. 12 copulations in their allowed roles (for donors 2. 98 ± 0. 16 copulations and for recipients 3. 14 ± 0. 12 copulations). In a single copulation, significantly more sperm was donated to partners that were restricted to mating in the female role than to hermaphrodites, while seminal fluid transfer was unaffected by recipient type.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. The goal of {{this work}} was to {{identify}} the nuclease associated with sperm DNA degradation in the <b>sperm</b> and surrounding <b>fluid</b> of the vas deferens and cauda epididymis of the mouse. Earlier work in our laboratory demonstrated sperm nucleolytic activity that cleaved chromatin {{to the size of}} 50 kbp with Mn 2 + and Ca 2 +, which could be reversed using EDTA. We have named this activity Sperm Chromatin Fragmentation (SCF). The reversible nature and activation of SCF using Mn 2 + and Ca 2 + are hallmarks of the nuclease topoisomerase IIB. When SCF is active {{for a period of time}} a different activity is observed that completely and irreversibly degrades the sperm chromatin. We have named this activity Sperm DNA Degradation (SDD). The complete degradation seen in SDD is much more pronounced in sperm from the vas deferens and the activity is greatly accelerated by the use of EGTA and Ca 2 +. We found that this combination causes the buffer to become acidic, and it is this acidity that activates the nuclease rather than EGTA and Ca 2 +. We developed a purification scheme for this nuclease, and then identified it as DNAse II, a known acidic nuclease, by Western blot analysis. The cauda epididymis and vas deferens act as storage areas for sperm, but may also function as a quality control mechanism for defective sperm. This is suggested by the drop in number of defective sperm seen in the cauda epidydimis compared to the caput suggesting they are being marked for degradation. The presence of DNase II in the vas deferens has yet to be described in the literature. Here we present evidence of its presence and activity in the <b>sperm</b> and luminal <b>fluid</b> of the male reproductive tract...|$|R

In conclusion, sex allocation and sexual conflict both contribute to decreased female fecundity in pond snails...|$|R
40|$|Sperm {{swimming}} at low Reynolds number {{have strong}} hydrodynamic interactions when their concentration {{is high in}} vivo or near substrates in vitro. The beating tails not only propel the <b>sperm</b> through a <b>fluid,</b> but also create flow fields through which sperm interact with each other. We study the hydrodynamic interaction and cooperation of sperm embedded in a two-dimensional fluid by using a particle-based mesoscopic simulation method, multi-particle collision dynamics (MPC). We analyze the sperm behavior by investigating {{the relationship between the}} beating-phase difference and the relative sperm position, as well as the energy consumption. Two effects of hydrodynamic interaction are found, synchronization and attraction. With these hydrodynamic effects, a multi-sperm system shows swarm behavior with a power-law dependence of the average cluster size on the width of the distribution of beating frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{were prepared}} against rabbit sperm antigens by fusing P 3 -X 63 -Ag 8 - 653 mouse myeloma cells with lymphocytes from Ba!b/c mice immunized with Tergito! NP 4 O deter-gent-so!ubiized rabbit epididymal <b>sperm.</b> Ascites <b>fluid</b> from mice injected {{with two of}} these hybridomas (8 C 4. 1 and 8 C 10. 5) was negative in immobilization and agglutination methods, however, acrosome positive on methanol fixed sperm and plasma membrane positive on unfixed sperm in indirect immunofluorescence. Insemination of female rabbits with the sperm treated with either of these monoclonal antibodies resulted in significant reduction in fertility as seen by the percentage of 9 -day implants/corpora lutea ratio (8 C 4. 1, 25. 7 %; 8 C 10. 5, 1. 9 %; and control, 64. 7 %). Though the antibodies inhibited in vitro binding of the rabbit sperm with zonac pellucidae of rat ova, fertilization in vivo was not affected significantly. The antibodies did not demonstrate antiblastocyst activity by immunofluorescence. Both of these monoclonal antibodies appeared to recognize the same antigen by the SDS-PAGE/Protein Blot enzyme immunobinding procedure. The antigen was of testicular origin and had a molecular weight of approximately 63, 000 daltons. It is concluded that these monoclonal antibodies which were organ specific, block post-fertilization fertility by inhibiting some step necessary for viable embryo formation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that males may vary the quality of their ejaculates in response to sperm competition, although the mechanisms by which they do so remain unclear. The viability of sperm is an important aspect of ejaculate quality that determines competitive fertilization success in the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus. Using in vitro mixtures of <b>sperm</b> and seminal <b>fluid</b> from pairs of male crickets, we show that seminal fluid can affect the viability of sperm in this species. We found that males who invest greatly in the viability of their own sperm can enhance the viability of rival sperm, providing the opportunity for males to exploit the investments in sperm competition made by their rivals. Transitive effects of seminal fluids across the ejaculates of different males are expected to have important implications for the dynamics of male investments in sperm competition...|$|R
40|$|Immunoelectrophoretic {{analyses}} {{were used to}} compare the antigenic characteristics of <b>sperm</b> and <b>fluids</b> recovered via cannulae implanted in the rete testis and proximal vas deferens of living bulls. Ejaculated semen, seminal vesicle fluid and blood serum also served as antigen sources. Although each reproductive fluid contained some blood antigens, these antigens were most numerous in rete testis fluid. Certain antigens present in rete testis fluid, but not detectable in blood serum, were associated with testicular sperm; others, common to seminal vesicle fluid, may be secretory products or enzymes originating in the seminiferous tubules. Some antigens apparently are selectively resorbed, utilized, or altered within the epididymis since all nonblood antigens entering the epididymis in rete testis fluid were not detected in cauda epididymal plasma. Other antigens in cauda epididymal plasma common to seminal vesicle fluid probably are secretory products of the epididymis. Studies of saline soluble antigens released by sonication of testicular and epididymal sperm revealed that sperm undergo antigenic modification during their epididymal passage. Some antigens apparently are lost from sperm into the surrounding fluid, while others possibly modified, remain associated with the cells. Furthermore, sperm acquire new anti-gens presumed to be secreted by the epididymis. Certain antigens available in seminal vesicle fluid at ejaculation already are present on testicular as well as epididymal sperm. Secretion and absorption of protein, changes in antigenicity of sperm under-going maturation, and other aspects of epididymal physiology have been eluci-dated by immunological studies (Hunte...|$|R
2500|$|Traumatic insemination, {{also known}} as {{hypodermic}} insemination, is the mating practice in some species of invertebrates in which the male pierces the female's abdomen with his penis and injects his sperm through the wound into her abdominal cavity (hemocoel). The sperm diffuse through the female's hemolymph, reaching the ovaries and resulting in fertilization. The process is detrimental to the female's health. It creates an open wound which impairs the female until it heals, and is susceptible to infection. [...] The injection of <b>sperm</b> and ejaculatory <b>fluids</b> into the hemocoel can also trigger an immune reaction in the female. Bed bugs, which reproduce solely by traumatic insemination, have evolved a pair of sperm-receptacles, known as the spermalege.

However, statistical experiments showed no conclusive evidence for that hypothesis; as of 2003, the preferred explanation for that organ is hygienic protection against bacteria.|$|R
40|$|Studying mate {{choice at}} the gamete level can provide {{valuable}} insights into proximate mechanisms {{that underlie the}} evolution of mating systems. The objective was to assess whether ovarian <b>fluid</b> enhances <b>sperm</b> performance based on relatedness of mates in lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, an iteroparous salmonid. Twelve trios were used, each composed of a female and two male fish; one male was related (full sibling) to the female, whereas the other was unrelated. Sperm from each male was activated in hatchery water or ovarian fluid from each corresponding female. No significant difference in sperm velocity was detected between the related and unrelated male fish when activated in hatchery water. However, when sperm was activated in ovarian <b>fluid,</b> <b>sperm</b> velocity from the related male {{was significantly higher than}} that of the unrelated male fish. Overall, ovarian <b>fluid</b> enhanced <b>sperm</b> performance of related male fish and might act as part of a recognition system to select sperm of a specific genotype. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
