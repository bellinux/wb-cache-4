After {{a lot of discussion}} and some deep soul searching, we realized that our current tour has given us the opportunity to leave Destiny's Child on a high note, united in our friendship and filled with an overwhelming gratitude for our music, our fans, and each other. After all these wonderful years working together, we realized that {{now is the time to}} pursue our personal goals and solo efforts in earnest...No matter what happens, we will always love each other as friends and sisters and will always support each other as artists. We want to thank all of our fans for their incredible love and support and hope to see you all again as we continue fulfilling our destinies. —Destiny's Child, MTV ...|$|E

500|$|Dylan {{had married}} Sara Lownds in November 1965. By {{the time the}} {{basement}} sessions started in Big Pink around June 1967, he had two children: Maria (Sara's daughter from her first marriage) and Jesse Dylan. Anna Dylan was born on July 11, 1967. Both Heylin and biographer Sid Griffin suggest that recording had to move from Dylan's home to Big Pink {{when it became clear}} that the sessions were getting in the way of family life. Domesticity was the context of The Basement Tapes, as Hudson said in The Last Waltz: [...] "Chopping wood and hitting your thumb with a hammer, fixing the tape recorder or the screen door, wandering off into the woods with Hamlet ... it was relaxed and low-key, which was something we hadn't enjoyed <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> children." [...] Several Basement Tapes songs, such as [...] "Clothes Line Saga" [...] and [...] "Apple Suckling Tree", celebrate the domestic aspects of the rural lifestyle.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} shot using the video mode of two Canon EOS 5D Mark II and one Canon EOS 1D Mark IV digital single-lens reflex cameras, which helped the filmmakers {{look more like}} typical park visitors. To {{compensate}} for their inability to control the lighting, the film was shot in monochrome mode. [...] "e were shooting with really fast lenses wide open, so our depth of field was razor thin. Black and white helped us enormously with focus and composition, <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing almost everything in camera and didn't use a focus puller," [...] Moore recalled. It was an irreversible choice. [...] "ecause the 5D doesn't shoot RAW, we customized settings in its monochromatic mode and couldn't go back to color, {{even if we had}} wanted to." [...] Moore was comfortable with the result because of the surrealistic, dreamlike quality it created, forcing viewers to see the familiar sights of the Disney parks in a new way.|$|E

[...] "Honestly," [...] he said, [...] "what we do now doesn't feel that much {{different from what we}} were doing then. We're very thankful to all of you out there for continuing to let us play in our corner of the sandbox."

Zinedine Zidane also praised Iniesta, stating on the Spanish radio station Cadena COPE, [...] "Iniesta really impresses me. He's got so much influence in Spain's game. He reminds me of myself." [...] Fernando Torres, Spain's striker, said, [...] "We've been playing together <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> 15 and I have never, ever seen him play badly." [...] He {{is widely regarded as}} one of the most respected and best midfielders of all time.|$|E
2500|$|Overstock filed {{a lawsuit}} against the hedge fund Rocker Partners in 2005, for libel, unfair {{business}} practices and tortious interference, saying it colluded with a research firm, Gradient Analytics, in short-selling the company while paying Gradient Analytics to publish negative reports about Overstock.com and supplying pre-publication copies to Rocker. Naked short-selling was not alleged in that suit. In a conference call with analysts in August 2005, a day after the suit was filed, Byrne said that [...] "there's been a plan <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in our teens to destroy our stock, drive it down to $6--$10 ... and even a plan for how the company would then get whacked up." [...] He said that the conspirators were part of a [...] "Miscreants Ball", headed by a [...] "Sith Lord", who he refused to identify but said [...] "he's one of the master criminals from the 1980s." [...] Byrne said the conspiracy included hedge funds, journalists, investigators, trial lawyers, the SEC, and Eliot Spitzer." [...] Gradient countersued, alleging Byrne waged a smear campaign.|$|E
2500|$|St. John's {{runs counter}} to the usual {{emphasis}} on rankings and selectivity. In the past, St. John's College chose {{not to participate in}} any collegiate rankings surveys and did not provide requested survey information. However, the school was still included in many ranking guides. In 2014, Annapolis President Christopher B. Nelson wrote a post to address the issue in his SignPosts for Liberal Education blog: After many years of refusing to participate at all in the rankings generated by U.S. News & World Report—one of the most prominent providers of college rankings—St. John's this year submitted statistical information for its survey. This change in practice was prompted by engaged parents who increasingly were asking whether the underlying data about St. John's in U.S. News was reliable. <b>Since</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not submitting information, we could not vouch for its reliability. Although St. John's would prefer not to be ranked, and has long asked not to be ranked, U.S. News continued to rank us. We concluded, therefore, that we had to supply statistical data in order to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information U.S. News was publishing about us.St. John's experienced an unprecedented leap upward in the 2014 U.S. News rankings after submitting data (as opposed to not providing information and still being ranked), as reported in the Washington Post.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a conference}} call with analysts in August 2005, Byrne said that [...] "there's been a plan <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in our teens to destroy our stock, drive it down to $6–$10 ... and even a plan for how the company would then get whacked up." [...] He said that the conspirators were part of a [...] "Miscreants Ball," [...] headed by a [...] "Sith Lord," [...] who he refused to {{identify}} but said [...] "he's one of the master criminals from the 1980s." [...] Byrne said the conspiracy included hedge funds, journalists, investigators, trial lawyers, the SEC, and Eliot Spitzer. Fortune writer Bethany McLean said that Byrne had become a [...] "hero to those who believe that short-sellers are the operators of Wall Street's ultimate black box, predators who destroy companies through innuendo, bullying, political connections—and sometimes through an illegal practice known as 'naked shorting.'" [...] Byrne financed and largely wrote a full-page advertisement in the Washington Post which said [...] "Naked short-selling ... is literally stealing money from the widows, retirees, and other small investors." [...] In a letter to the Wall Street Journal in April 2006, Byrne contended that [...] "blackguards have practiced 'failure to deliver'" [...] of securities, were [...] "destroying businesses and (probably) destabilizing our capital markets." [...] Since 2005, Overstock has filed two lawsuits relating to the matters under Byrne's direction. After her article appeared in 2005, McLean was attacked by Byrne with such vehemence that she ceased covering him.|$|E
2500|$|Abe {{was arrested}} and interrogated over eight sessions. When asked why she had severed Ishida's genitalia, Abe replied, [...] "Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. I {{wanted to take the}} part of him that brought back to me the most vivid memories." [...] The {{interrogating}} officer was struck by Abe's demeanor when asked why she had killed Ishida. [...] "Immediately she became excited and her eyes sparkled in a strange way." [...] Her answer was: [...] "I loved him so much, I wanted him all to myself. But <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not husband and wife, as long as he lived he could be embraced by other women. I knew that if I killed him no other woman could ever touch him again, so I killed him....." [...] In attempting to explain what distinguished Abe's case from over a dozen other similar cases in Japan, William Johnston suggests that it is this answer which captured the imagination of the nation. [...] "She had killed not out of jealousy but out of love." [...] Mark Schreiber notes that the Sada Abe incident occurred {{at a time when the}} Japanese media were preoccupied with extreme political and military troubles, including the Ni Ni Roku incident and a looming full-scale war in China. He suggests that a sensationalistic sex scandal such as this served as a welcome national release from the disturbing events of the time. The incident also struck a chord with the ero-guro-nansensu ("erotic-grotesque-nonsense") style popular at the time, and the Sada Abe Incident came to represent that genre for years to come.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of July, Maroney competed at the Olympic Trials in San Jose, California. [...] After {{the first day of}} competition she said, [...] "I'm thankful that I'm even here. I knew I had to hit vault because it's the most important event for me to make the Olympic team." [...] Though she had falls on both bars and beam on day one, and a major loss of formation on bars during day two, she placed seventh in the all-around with a two-day combined score of 117.650. In event finals, she placed first on vault scoring 31.700 and fifth on floor scoring 29.700. Afterwards, Maroney was chosen {{as a member of the}} team that was sent to the 2012 Summer Olympics. [...] She said, [...] "This is the best feeling – it's just so amazing. I'm in shock right now. I think this will be the happiest I'll ever be in my life. [...] It's the absolute best feeling knowing that I trained so hard for this and all the hard things that I have accomplished and now to be on this team. [...] These girls are my best friends. [...] My team mate Kyla Ross, we have been best friends <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> six years old so it's just absolutely amazing to be going to the Olympics." [...] When asked about feeling pressure to win gold on vault at the Olympics, she replied, [...] "If I do my job I know I can get the gold medal. [...] That's what they picked me to be on the team for, so I need to be confident about that." ...|$|E
