40|$|Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) {{represent}} a powerful learning paradigm {{able to provide}} accurate and reliable decision functions in several application fields. In particular, they are really attractive for application in medical domain, where often {{a lack of knowledge}} exists. Kernel trick, on which SVMs are based, allows to map non-linearly separable data into potentially linearly separable one, according to the kernel function and its internal parameters value. During recent years non-parametric approaches have also been proposed for learning the most appropriate kernel, such as linear combination of basic kernels. Thus, SVMs classifiers may have several parameters to be tuned and their optimal values are usually difficult to be identified a-priori. Furthermore, combining different classifiers may reduce risk to perform errors on new unseen data. For such reasons, we present an hyper-solution framework for SVM classification, based on meta-heuristics, that searches for the most reliable hyper-classifier (<b>SVM</b> <b>with</b> a basic kernel, <b>SVM</b> <b>with</b> a <b>combination</b> of kernel, and ensemble of SVMs), and for its optimal configuration. We have applied the proposed framework on a critical and quite complex issue for the management of Chronic Heart Failure patient: the early detection of decompensation conditions. In fact, predicting new destabilizations in advance may reduce the burden of heart failure on the healthcare systems while improving quality of life of affected patients. Promising reliability has been obtained on 10 -fold cross validation, proving our approach to be efficient and effective for an high-level analysis of clinical data...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSupport Vector Machines (SVMs) {{classification}} {{learning is}} a powerful paradigm to investigate inverse input-output relationship of a specific problem according to some available and representative dataset. In particular, SVMs are able to identify even non-linear relationship by mapping non-linearly separable data into potentially linearly separable one through families of spatial transformation (kernel trick). With respect to this, several parameters (i. e., kernel function and its internal parameters) have to be tuned; however the optimal configuration is usually difficult to be defined a-priori. In this paper, a hyper-solution framework for SVM classification is presented. The main idea is to perform, simultaneously, three different SVM-based classification learning tasks: Model Selection, Multiple Kernel Learning and Ensemble Learning. The meta-heuristic known as Genetic Algorithms (GA) has been proposed {{to search for the}} most reliable final hyper-classifier (an <b>SVM</b> <b>with</b> a basic kernel, an <b>SVM</b> <b>with</b> a <b>combination</b> of kernel, or an ensemble of different SVMs, respectively), and the corresponding optimal configuration. We have applied the proposed framework on a critical and quite complex problem: the on-line assessment of structural health of aircraft fuselage panels, a crucial task both in military and civilian settings. In particular, the framework has been used to implement a diagnosis task, that is detecting a possible damage and identifying the structural component involved, according to the strain field measured through a monitoring sensor network deployed on the helicopter fuselage panels. Finite Elements (FE) simulation has been configured to simulate the response of a real panel to different damages. The resulting simulated strain fields have been used to build a dataset. Results obtained through 3 folds-cross validation proved the framework is reliable. Finally, when compared to results obtained by the authors in a previous work based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) classification learning paradigm, the proposed SVM framework proved to be more effective and reliable...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{point out}} that there exist scaling and {{initialization}} problems in most existing multiple kernel learning (MKL) approaches, which employ the large margin principle to jointly learn both a kernel and an SVM classifier. The reason is that the margin itself can not well describe how good a kernel is due to the negligence of the scaling. We use the ratio between the margin and the radius of the minimum enclosing ball to measure the goodness of a kernel, and present a new minimization formulation for kernel learning. This formulation is invariant to scalings of learned kernels, and when learning linear combination of basis kernels it is also invariant to scalings of basis kernels and to the types (e. g., L 1 or L 2) of norm constraints on combination coefficients. We establish the differentiability of our formulation, and propose a gradient projection algorithm for kernel learning. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both <b>SVM</b> <b>with</b> the uniform <b>combination</b> of basis kernels and other state-of-art MKL approaches. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent {{breakthroughs}} in computer vision and digital microscopy have prompted {{the application of}} such technologies in cancer diagnosis, especially in histopathological image analysis. Earlier, an attempt to classify hepatocellular carcinoma images based on nuclear and structural features {{has been carried out}} on a set of surgical resected samples. Here, we proposed methods to enhance the process and improve the classification performance. Methods: First, we segmented the histological components of the liver tissues and generated several masked images. By utilizing the masked images, some set of new features were introduced, producing three sets of features consisting nuclei, trabecular and tissue changes features. Furthermore, we extended the classification process by using biopsy resected samples in addition to the surgical samples. Results: Experiments by using support vector machine (<b>SVM)</b> classifier <b>with</b> <b>combinations</b> of features and sample types showed that the proposed methods improve the classification rate in HCC detection for about 1 - 3 %. Moreover, detection rate of low-grades cancer increased when the new features were appended in the classification process, although the rate was worsen in the case of undifferentiated tumors. Conclusions: The masking process increased the reliability of extracted nuclei features. The additional of new features improved the system especially for early HCC detection. Likewise, the combination of surgical and biopsy samples as training data could also improve the classification rates. Therefore, the methods will extend the support for pathologists in the HCC diagnosis...|$|R

Combining the features and classifying them using SVM and then finally comparing the results with the previous approach not only gives a better accuracy, but also evaluates the generalization ability under the limited training samples.

40|$|Abstract—Using discriminative classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines (<b>SVMs)</b> in <b>combination</b> <b>with,</b> {{or as an}} {{alternative}} to, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) {{has a number of}} advantages for difficult speech recognition tasks. For example, the models can make use of additional dependencies in the observation sequences than HMMs provided the appropriate form of kernel is used. However standard SVMs are binary classifiers, and speech is a multi-class problem. Furthermore, to train SVMs to distinguish word pairs requires that each word appears in the training data. This paper examines both of these limitations. Tree-based reduction approaches for multiclass classification are described, {{as well as some of}} the issues in applying them to dynamic data, such as speech. To address the training data issues, a simplified version of HMM-based synthesis can be used, which allows data for any word-pair to be generated. These approaches are evaluated on two noise corrupted digit sequence tasks: AURORA 2. 0; and actual in-car collected data. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Ensemble {{learning}} algorithms such as boosting {{can achieve}} better performance by averaging over {{the predictions of}} base hypotheses. However, most existing algorithms are limited to combining only {{a finite number of}} hypotheses, and the generated ensemble is usually sparse. It has recently been shown that the support vector machine (<b>SVM)</b> <b>with</b> a carefully crafted kernel can be used to construct a nonsparse ensemble of infinitely many hypotheses. Such infinite ensembles may surpass finite and/or sparse ensembles in learning performance and robustness. In this paper, we derive two novel kernels, the stump kernel and the perceptron kernel, for infinite ensemble learning. The stump kernel embodies an infinite number of decision stumps, and measures the similarity between examples by the ℓ 1 -norm distance. The perceptron kernel embodies perceptrons, and works with the ℓ 2 -norm distance. Experimental results show that <b>SVM</b> <b>with</b> these kernels is superior to boosting with the same base hypothesis set.
