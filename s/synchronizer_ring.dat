The cone's taper {{means that a}} given amount of movement of the actuator makes the surfaces approach (or recede) much more slowly than in a disc clutch. As well, a given amount of actuating force creates more pressure on the mating surfaces.The best known example of a cone clutch is a <b>synchronizer</b> <b>ring</b> in a manual transmission. The <b>synchronizer</b> <b>ring</b> is responsible for [...] "synchronizing" [...] the speeds of the shift hub and the gear wheel to ensure a smooth gear change.|$|E

40|$|Robust and {{efficient}} synchronizers are keys elements to ensure good gear shift in heavy vehicles. In {{order to improve}} existing as well as develop new synchronizers, efficient simulation tools are needed. In this contribution, a mechanical system with 5 degrees of freedom modelling a generic synchronizer consisting of engaging sleeve, <b>synchronizer</b> <b>ring</b> and gearwheel are considered. Due {{to the design of}} the different components and their interactions the synchronizing process is described in terms of different steps or phases; presynchronization, main synchronization, blocker transition and engagement. The four main phases are further divided into sub-phases. To study the whole process in a unified manner, Constrained Lagrangian Formalism (CLF) {{turns out to be a}} suitable method in which the interactions between components (sleeve, <b>synchronizer</b> <b>ring</b> and gearwheel) are described by unilateral or/and bilateral constraints imposed on generalized coordinates of the system during different phases. Using CLF a mathematical model of a generic synchronizer is developed and represented by the system of differential-algebraic equations. Kinematics and kinetics of the generic synchronizer are modelled for each sub-phase. The sleeve is considered as a master and the gearwheel is considered as a slave. The statement of the dynamics problem for a generic synchronizer is given and the numerical algorithm is implemented in Matlab for solving the differential-algebraic equations resulting from CLF. The generic synchronizer computational model is adapted to available experimental setup and validated using obtained measurement data. Sensitivity of the synchronization time is studied varying the cone angle, coefficient of dry friction and sleeve force. Effect of driveline vibrations on synchronization performance is also studied...|$|E
40|$|Synchronizers are a {{ubiquitous}} {{component of}} almost every type of transmission in modem vehicles. They are mechanical devices whose function {{is to ensure that}} components rotating at different rates can be harmonized smoothly and without eroding their surfaces. They are responsible for both the durability of the transmission and the comfort of the passengers. This work analyzes the capabilities and limitations of synchronizers to be used in a novel transmission. It is a contribution to a larger project whose goal is to develop a hybrid, clutchless transmission for a performance vehicle that will improve efficiency by eliminating the friction and mechanical losses inherent in a traditional clutch. An overview of the synchronization process is presented followed by a simplified mathematical model of the common baulk-ring synchronizer. The model is experimentally validated in order to make predictions of the device's performance on the new transmission. Several simulated scenarios are then developed that provide information that is critical for designing synchronizers for the clutchless transmission. Matlab code was developed for these simulations and is provided at the end for replication of the results. Considering the demanding environment under which the synchronizers are expected to operate in the clutchless transmission, the possible failure modes of the synchronizer components are investigated. Finite element analysis (FEA) is used to predict the maximum loads on the <b>synchronizer</b> <b>ring</b> before the material yields. An energy analysis is also performed to ensure that the energy dissipation rate of the friction surfaces is adequate. by Amado Antonini. Thesis: S.

50|$|Synchronizing {{rings are}} made of metal and can be {{provided}} with anti-wear coatings called a friction lining.Common metals for <b>synchronizer</b> <b>rings</b> are brass and steel. The linings typically consist of molybdenum, iron, bronze or carbon.The synchronizing rings are produced either by massive forming (common forging) or sheet metal shaping. The latter involves the stamping of the blank out of a sheet metal strip and the subsequent machining with follow-on composite tools or transfer tools. A friction lining usually consists of thermally splashed molybdenum. Alternatively, iron or bronze sinter friction layers can be used. Carbon-coated <b>synchronizer</b> <b>rings</b> are particularly wear resistant and offer very good friction behavior. Due to their higher price, these are reserved for high-performance transmissions.|$|R

Between 1988 and 1993 the {{transmission}} featured an internal slave cylinder, the next year (1994) the transmission was redesigned to have an external slave cylinder for easier maintenance.

50|$|Triple-cone {{synchronizers}} {{are used}} on 1st and 2nd gears. These synchronizers have three friction surfaces, which increase {{their ability to}} transfer the flow of torque more smoothly from one gear to another. Synchronizers act as clutches to speed up or slow down the gearsets that are being shifted to, and greater friction area results in easier shifting for the driver. The 3rd, 4th, and reverse synchronizers are double-cone, while the 5th and 6th gear synchronizers are single-cone. All of the friction surfaces on the <b>Synchronizer</b> <b>rings</b> are sintered bronze. The ratios in the 6-speed are widely spaced for versatile performance and efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the intermediate shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the <b>synchronizer</b> <b>rings</b> for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear shafts. The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The clutch release bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Hot working dies are {{influenced}} by three main factors causing their destruction: the cyclically changeable mechanical loads, intensive thermal shocks, as well as intensive friction, and erosion. The great variety of the shapes of forgings, the material they are made of (carbon steel, alloy steel, brass) and the precision of their production – whether {{they are supposed to}} undergo further treatment or are considered to be the final products – result in a variety of problems encountered in the production process. In this paper the wear mechanisms of different types of forging dies, covered by the composite layer “nitride layer / PVD coating” were analysed. Design/methodology/approach: In order to estimate the influence of the different shapes of forgings for their wear mechanism, it was decided to that maintenance tests on two series of tools with different shapes made of DIN 1. 2344 steel, coated with composite layer “nitrided layer/CrN coating” needed to be taken. The first one was designed for production of gears pre-forging and the second one was designed for the production of steel <b>synchronizer</b> <b>rings.</b> Findings: The abrasive wear together with thermal-mechanical fatigue and plastic strain is a crucial factor of the process of wearing of forging dies for the production of forgings with high dimensional accuracy and not subject to further mechanical treatment. The variety of the shapes of the forging and the precision with which it is made have strong influence on the intensity of the abrasive wear of forging dies. Research limitations/implications: To ensure higher effectiveness of the application of hybrid technologies of surface treatment for the increase of the durability of forging dies, the complex analysis of the influence of such various aspects of the forging process as: surface treatment, the shape of the die and the cooling and lubricating system are necessary on {{the development of a new}} generation of dies with increased operational durability. Practical implications: The obtained results of the tests have been practically applied in the FA “Swarzędz” enterprise to increase the durability of the forging dies for steel <b>synchronizer</b> <b>rings.</b> Originality/value: In order to ensure a required level of effectiveness of the use of layered composites of the “nitrided layer/ PVD coating” type for the increase in the durability of forging dies, it is necessary to properly select the composites on the basis of the analysis of the intensity of forging dies wear mechanisms...|$|R
