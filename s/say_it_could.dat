25|$|The Piraeus Athena {{has been}} {{determined}} to be an original, and many believe that the Athena Mattei exposed in the Louvre is the sole existing copy of it, even though {{the position of the}} right arm is in a different position. There are various artists who have been thought to have possibly made the Piraeus Athena. Some <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be the work of Cephisodotos, who is known to have made a statue of Athena during the fourth century BC. Others say that it may be the work of Euphranor because it shares similarities with one of his other works, the Apollo Patroos. Similarities include a full face and long neck that indicates a similarity in style, according to the scholar, Olga Palagia.|$|E
25|$|Some Green Minibus Unions {{have called}} for the Government to provide a new fleet of buses which can hold up to 20 people, 4 more people than the current 16 people. They <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> help ease traffic {{congestion}} during rush hour and possible push up profits which may turn away possible fare increases. There {{are a few of}} the new buses in service at the moment, but because it is only legal to have 16 passengers in a minibus, the extra area is used as a luggage rack. The Government has responded saying that it would be prudent to first study the implications of such expansion in the context of a Public Transport Strategy Study first, which should take two years ending in 2017 or 2018.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2010 in Potsdam, about 70 {{supporters}} of the Berlin chapter of the Bandidos MC, who usually are hostile to the Hells Angels, moved to the Berlin chapter of the Hells Angels. Police reports say the background of this step is unknown.

Other sources <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> {{have something to do with}} the immigrant background of the Berlin chapter of the Bandidos. German Bandidos probably have a problem with members of foreign origin.
