5000|$|The {{programme}} attracted controversy {{several months}} before it was finally broadcast, with the dog fouling incident coming in for particular criticism. Dorothy Kelk, {{speaking on behalf of}} the Preston branch of Friends of the Earth, said the BBC had been [...] "extremely irresponsible", adding: [...] "Dog excrement fouling a road is unhygienic and can cause illness in young children." [...] On the same issue, Ken Hudson, the Conservative leader of Preston City Council, said: [...] "I think we have sufficient problems trying to regulate people to collect dog droppings without artificially manufacturing a programme which causes effluent on the streets." [...] But defending the scene, a BBC spokesman said: [...] "The filming of the dog-walking scene demonstrates in exaggerated form one of the challenges residents would face if <b>street-cleaning</b> <b>services</b> were cut. The residents rose to the challenge and cleaned up the small amount of dog dirt extremely quickly." ...|$|E

It summarises evidence from a study of <b>street-cleaning</b> <b>services</b> in the UK, which shows that resource allocation does not always follow needs – even {{at a time when}} there was public spending growth and the needs of deprived neighbourhoods were to the fore – and that it can be skewed to better-off areas, making service-provision actually part of the problem for residents in these neighbourhoods. The author argues that, although today’s austerity presents significant challenges for those who wish to protect the most vulnerable, it may still be possible to find ways to deliver services which do not simply reinforce inequality. This paper is part of a series of papers which have resulted from the Whose Economy? seminar series, held in Scotland in 2010 – 2011, whose purpose was to provide a space for researchers, representative organisations, policy-makers and people with experience of poverty to come together and explore the causes of poverty and inequality in today’s Scotland...|$|E

On the other hand, not registering deaths, especially those who died during the 1930s famines and prison inmates, was common. For example, during the Holodomor, starving peasants tried (despite the official ban) to escape to the cities where they could earn or beg for food. Many of them died in the streets. In 1933, the <b>street-cleaning</b> <b>service</b> of Kiev picked up 9,472 dead bodies. Only 3,991 of them were officially registered while 5481 were disposed of without formal registration according to the instructions of the prosecutor's office.|$|R
