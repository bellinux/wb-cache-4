The most important pre-Hispanic structure are found at the Xochicalco and Teopanzolco archeological sites. The first is a city that was built {{on top of a}} large hill, with the Temple of Quetzalcoatl as its center. This temple is really a pyramid with significant Toltec influence with four columns in the center. Teopanzolco has a pyramid with twin temples, as it was built by the <b>safter</b> they conquered the area. After the , major constructions here were Christian instead of the native pagan. In {{the first half of the}} 16th century, a series of fortress-like church and monastery complexes were built around the slopes of the Popocatepetl volcano from Cuernavaca to Tetela del Volcán, and on into Puebla state, all related to early evangelization efforts. Today, these monasteries are no longer used as such, although most of the churches associated with them remain active, and are now a World Heritage Site. Non-ecclesiastical buildings from the colonial and independence periods were mostly confined to the capital of Cuernavaca and include the Palacio de Cortés, the Borda Gardens and the Morelos and Ocampo Theaters. Much of the rest of the state was divided into large haciendas, many dedicated to sugar production, with large senorial mansions for their owners. Some of these include Hacienda de Chiconcuac, Hacienda de San Gaspar and Hacienda de Ixtoluca. One notable 20th-century structure was the Japananese style house built by Woolworths heiress Barbara Hutton, just outside the city of Cuernavaca.|$|E

40|$|It is internationally {{recognized}} that teachers {{play a significant}} role in developing suitable values in their pupils. Students also learn strategies for identifying problems, making decisions, and finding solutions both in and out of school. Among them creative thinking skills play a prominent role in their learning process. Techniques developed specifically to teach creative thinking and examine how they may be applied to the classroom, are precise things to be considered. Awareness with techniques designed to improve creative thinking gives individuals a set of tools to use in their exploratory behaviour. Though there are various methods, the major innovative thinking skills that play the crucial role in learning process are visualization and creative dramatics, Torrance and <b>Safter's</b> incubation model, use of metaphors and analogies, divergent thinking strategies and commercial and competitive programmes. Brainstorming, the acronym scamper which is a useful tool for many creative endeavours and can assist children as well as adults in using the idea-spurring questions that can help them generate diverse ideas, and future solving problem, are the most popular innovative techniques that the teachers employ in moulding the young buds into colourful blossoms who are sole responsible to create the society more modest where we can live pleasantly.

40|$|AbstractEngineering {{education}} in higher institutions {{as a whole}} continues to face many challenges despite the implementation of many teaching and learning approaches. The engineering profession requires both ‘hands-on’ experience and conceptual knowledge and therefore, experiential learning can be suitably used {{as a foundation for}} teaching and learning of engineering (Lynch and Russell, 2009). Engineering study programmes involving certain skills and attributes that are not generally achieved in traditional delivery methods have been proven to be successfully implemented through experiential learning activities (Harrisberger, 1976). This study is conducted to explore whether creativity and innovative thinking can be nurtured through experiential learning environment at university level. Creative approaches to solving problems lead to innovation in technology which is essential to fuel the economy (Roberts, 2010). The study investigated how construct-based creativity models reflect creative behaviour through an experiential-based learning environment. The construct-based model used is by Torrance and <b>Safter</b> (Torrance and <b>Safter,</b> 1999) by measuring students against a list of creativity attributes. The framework of the research involves five componentsnamely field observations, focus group interviews, student questionnaires, creativity test and student portfolio assessments. Participants were students and instructors from the Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment and the Faculty of Information Science and Technology who participated in the Malaysian ROBOCON 2010. The ROBOCON 2010 is an annual international robot contest for undergraduate students of higher institutions. Initial findings suggest that students’ creativity dimensions have been nurtured and enhanced {{as a result of the}} problem solving process involved in the experiential learning activities. The findings of this preliminary work will be used in future for more detailed study on nurturing creativity and innovation among students.

He left no {{surviving}} family, except for his wide family of friends, students, and colleagues, and the rich legacy of his life’s work, in both mathematics and as an art collector. “Sammy”, as he has long been called by all who {{had the good fortune}} to know him, was one of the great architects of twentieth-century mathematics and definitively reshaped the ways we think about topology. The ideas that accomplished this were so fundamental and supple that they took on a life of their own, giving birth first to homological algebra and in turn to category theory, structures that now permeate much of contemporary mathematics. Born in Warsaw, Poland, Sammy studied in the Polish school of topology. At his father’s urging, he fled Europe in 1939. On his arrival in Princeton, Oswald Veblen and Solomon Lefschetz helped him (as they had helped other refugees) find a position at the University of Michigan, where Ray Wilder was building up a group in topology.

40|$|The {{functional}} duality of eosinophils, {{involved in}} a protective response or in pathogenesis is illustrated in various parasitic infections. In schistosomiasis, eosinophils {{have been shown to}} mediate schistosomula killing, in the presence of antibodies. The association of eosinophil-dependent cytotoxic antibody isotypes with resistance of reinfection (IgE and IgA antibodies), whereas in vitro blocking antibody isotypes (IgG 4, IgM) were detected in susceptible subjects, suggested a participation of eosinophils in antibody-dependent protective response. However eosinophils could participate to granuloma formation and consequently to the pathological reactions during schistosomiasis. Activation of eosinophils by antibodies, leading to release of granule proteins have been studied in patients with filariasis. Eosinophil peroxidase, EPO was released <b>safter</b> IgE-dependent activation whereas Eosinophil Cationic Protein, ECP, was released after IgG- and IgA-dependent activation of eosinophils, results suggesting a process of differential release mediators. Interactions between eosinophils and interleukins, and specially IL- 5 are discussed. Whereas a receptor for IL- 5 has been characterized on human eosinophils, recent studies have shown that eosinophils, expressed the messenger RNA encoding IL- 5. These results associated to data showing the synthesis of other cytokines indicate that eosinophils are not only the source of cytotoxic mediators involved in the effector phase of immunity but also of growth and regualtory factors, participating to immunoregulation...|$|E

The internal consistency and inter-rater reliability of squiggling was found to be acceptable. Mixed results were found between the six subscales in terms of concurrent validity with the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT: Torrance, Bal & <b>Safter,</b> 2008). Squiggling subscales Elaboration and Imagination showed signs of psychometric strength. However, Fluency and Originality require revision. Concurrent validity of the subscales Flexibility and Integration were not established. A matched-participants design enabled testing of hypothesised differences in creative thinking abilities with children with Asperger syndrome using the TTCT (Torrance et al., 2008) : Abstractedness, Fluency, Originality, Integration, Elaboration, Resistance to Premature Foreclosure and Flexibility. Children with Asperger syndrome demonstrated a significantly higher level of elaboration and abstract imagination in their drawings relative to a comparison group of typically-developing children matched on age, visual motor integration ability and non-verbal IQ. Findings indicate partial support for the Weak Central Coherence Theory (Shah and Frith, 1983) and Leslie???s (1987) Meta-Representational Deficit hypothesis. Children with Asperger syndrome demonstrated understanding and expression of abstract concepts as graphical representations, thereby supporting their use in clinical assessments and interventions. No support was found for the Executive Dysfunction Theory (Pennington & Ozonoff, 1996) or for the Hyper-Systemising Theory (Baron-Cohen, 2006).
