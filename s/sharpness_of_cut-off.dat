The <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> this <b>cut-off</b> {{is related to}} the <b>sharpness</b> (narrowness) <b>of</b> the assumed impact-parameter distribution of the multiplicities. The position and motion <b>of</b> the <b>cut-off</b> point are related to geometrical and KNO scaling and their violation, in particular, by the rise of the ratio sigma sub e sub l /sigma sub t.

It significantly improves the <b>cut-off</b> performance <b>of</b> the lumped element based Bessel type LPF. The <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> pass <b>cut-off</b> <b>of</b> the DGS based Bessel filter is comparable to that <b>of</b> the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the Butterworth kind LPF. The frequency range of 10 dB return loss of the DGS based Bessel LPF is 1. 91 GHz as against 0. 8 GHz for the lumped element based Bessel LPF. The variation in group delay of the DGS based Bessel LPF in pass-band is 42. 8 ps; whereas the DGS based Chebyshev and Butterworth LPF have group delays 277 ps and 120 ps respectively. 4 page(s...|$|R

In the current study similar perception experiments were carried out with real rubbing sounds generated by gently gliding pieces of paper {{back and forth over}} each other. It is shown that the results of the previous and the current experiments can be explained from the calculated perceptual brightness and <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the synthetic and real rubbing sounds. The perceived speed appears to be positively related to the brightness of the sounds, while the perceived pressure is negatively related to the brightness and positively to the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the sounds...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe work {{described}} in this paper explores if the same visual modality (<b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> curvature) {{can be used to}} express different dimensions of emotions (arousal and valence) depending on the modalities it is combined with. We propose two novel approaches to visually express emotions in affective agents. Both models employ a simplistic character consisting of an abstract body modelled as a closed sequence of concatenated curves. Emotions are represented in terms of arousal and valence dimensions. In the first model, the arousal value is expressed through the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the curves that comprise the character outline, while the valence value is expressed through the curvature of the character's mouth. In the second model, the arousal value is expressed through the character's movement, while the valence value is expressed through the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the curves that comprise the character outline. Thus, <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> curvature is used to express arousal in the first model and valence in the second one. The paper also describes a user experiment which investigated whether the arousal and valence expressed by our models are appropriately perceived by the users or not. The results support both models and suggest that <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> curvature could be used to express arousal or valence if consistently combined with other appropriate modalities...|$|R

40|$|A {{large sample}} of {{threshold}} tuning curves of single units from {{various levels of}} the auditory pathway was used {{in order to examine}} the relationship between best frequency and a measure <b>of</b> <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> tuning. This measure is simply the tuning curve bandwidth at 20 dB above threshold on a square-root scale of frequency. The transformation was found to be largely independent of unit best frequency, suggesting that it is suitable for comparing <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> tuning between samples. No difference in <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> tuning was found between samples of units from nuclei in the lemniscal auditory pathway, although units from the anterior auditory field showed broader tuning than those in the lemniscal pathway...|$|R
