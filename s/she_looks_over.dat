25|$|He {{is perhaps}} best known for his portraits, and his sitters {{including}} {{some of the most important}} men and women of his time. His portrait of painter Lydia Field Emmet in 1892 depicts Emmet in a pose typically reserved for men in old masters' paintings. Emmet's hand is on her hip and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder at the audience.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills {{applying}} red lipstick, {{in a car}} mirror, while the instrumental of the song plays. She leaves the car and passes by a man, who is afterwards seen standing between two women wearing plastic masks of Kills' face. The music mutes {{and the sound of}} footsteps is heard repeatedly as Kills approaches a cracked mirror. After hearing a noise behind her, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder as her reflection looks to her as well. Kills is dragged into the mirror, and the title card of the first act, [...] "Vanity". During the section, a metal skull is shown while Kills lip-synchs the song in front of a mirror. The visual transitions to its second act, dubbed [...] "Control", in which she holds an axe while standing on top of a glass box. A man is seen inside the box, filming her as she moves around it. The video then shifts to act three, named [...] "Sex", in which Kill is depicted singing to a skull. Towards the end of the video, Kills is seen handcuffed and chained while sitting on the floor, and seducing a blindfolded man.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{discussed}} {{instance of}} a pillow shot in any Ozu film—indeed, {{the most famous}} crux in the director's work—is the scene that takes place at an inn in Kyoto, in which a vase figures prominently. During the father and daughter's last trip together, after a day sightseeing [...] with Professor Onodera {{and his wife and}} daughter, they decide to go to sleep, and lie down on their separate futons {{on the floor of the}} inn. Noriko talks about what a nice person Onodera's new wife is, and how embarrassed she feels for having called Onodera's remarriage [...] "filthy." [...] Shukichi assures her that she should not worry about it, because Onodera never took her words seriously. After Noriko confesses to her father that she found the thought of his own remarriage [...] "distasteful," [...] <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> to discover that he is already asleep, or seems to be. She looks up towards the ceiling and appears to smile.|$|E
60|$|Julien was {{a little}} staggered. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> at him and laughed scornfully.|$|R
60|$|He {{took some}} loose pages {{up in his}} hand. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Anna did not pause, but <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} with slightly lifted eyebrows.|$|R
6000|$|... "So," [...] said Otter after a pause. [...] "Well, the Shepherdess, {{as these}} Settlement people call her, {{will want to}} find her father. Say, Baas, she is proud, is she not? <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> our heads and speaks little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not a {{very good}} ladder, but it's quite firm," [...] says I, as he seemed to be afraid of it. And he didn't look a broken-down old man, either. You can see {{yourself}} what he is. Straight as a poker, and life enough in him yet. But he made no move, and I began to feel foolish. Then she comes forward. [...] "Oh! Thank you, Mr Franklin. I'll help my father up." [...] Flabbergasted me--to be choked off like this. Pushed in between him and me without as much as a look my way. So of course I dropped it. What do you think? I fell back. I would have gone up on board at once and left them on the quay to come up or stay there till next week, only they were blocking the way. I couldn't very well shove them on one side. Devil only knows what was up between them. There she was, pale as death, talking to him very fast. He got as red as a turkey-cock-- dash me if he didn't. A bad-tempered old bloke, I can tell you. And a bad lot, too. Never mind. I couldn't hear what she was saying to him, but she put force enough into it to shake her. It seemed--it seemed, mind!--that he didn't want to go on board. Of course it couldn't have been that. I know better. Well, she took him by the arm, above the elbow, as if to lead him, or push him rather. I was standing not quite ten feet off. Why should I have gone away? I was anxious to get back on board as soon as they would let me. I didn't want to overhear her blamed whispering either. But I couldn't stay there for ever, so I made a move to get past them if I could. And that's how I heard a few words. It was the old chap--something nasty about being [...] "under the heel" [...] of somebody or other. Then he says, [...] "I don't want this sacrifice." [...] What it meant I can't tell. It was a quarrel--of that I am certain. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder, and sees me pretty close to them. I don't know what she found to say into his ear, but he gave way suddenly. He looked round at me too, and they went up together so quickly then that when I got on the quarter-deck I was only {{in time to see the}} inner door of the passage close after them. Queer--eh? But if it were only queerness one wouldn't mind. Some luggage in new trunks came on board in the afternoon. We undocked at midnight. And may I be hanged if I know who or what he was or is. I haven't been able to find out. No, I don't know. He may have been anything. All I know is that once, years ago when I went to see the Derby with a friend, I saw a pea-and-thimble chap who looked just like that old mystery father out of a cab.|$|E
50|$|Angela tells Nathan {{that she}} won't help {{now as he}} pushed her aside {{to work with the}} government. As she says this <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> a file on Danko, it has a {{newspaper}} clipping and mentions a killing.|$|E
60|$|As {{the girl}} did so <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{her hand at}} me, and lifted her eyebrows very slightly.|$|R
60|$|He {{handed her}} the letter she had written and left {{on the table at}} Mrs. Jethway's. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> it vacantly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{a corner}} of the old grassy ditch, just where the marsh and the yellow flowers came nearest to it.|$|R
50|$|Julia visits Mrs. Rudge in a {{psychiatric}} home. Mrs. Rudge confesses that she killed Olivia after learning of the murder. As Julia leaves <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder at Mrs. Rudge, who sees Olivia's eyes and dies of a fright-induced heart attack.|$|E
5000|$|As Wesley weeps {{and holds}} Fred's body in his arms, {{she begins to}} convulse, {{throwing}} them both to the floor. Fred rises from the floor as Ilyria, her hair and eyes now a frozen blue. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> Fred's hand and remarks, [...] "This will do." ...|$|E

60|$|Priscilla stood {{quiet for}} a minute. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the crowd, and then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at the poor Hof-rath, who now began {{to show that he}} was a little frightened.|$|R
6000|$|His wife overheard him and pausing in her task of {{refilling}} {{the glasses}} {{for the rich}} man's party <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder and said: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> it carefully, {{and as the}} {{ten minutes}} had passed without sign of the governess's return, asked what {{naturally}} followed in the morning's employment.|$|R
50|$|The {{central figure}} of The Street Enters the House {{is a woman}} dressed in blue and white, viewed from behind and above. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> her balcony at a busy street scene, a riot of colours, lines, and angles. On {{the road in front}} of her, workers lift poles to form the walls of a new building, {{surrounded}} by a pile of bricks. On every side of this construction, white and blue houses lean into the street. Two of the balconies are occupied by other figures peering down into the road. A line of horses flies past the foreground.|$|E
50|$|After {{the wind}} dies, Helena emerges to find Koenig dying. Before {{she can do}} anything, he is gone. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> the devastation that was once an idyllic {{woodland}} and breaks down, sobbing. She is brought up short by a hand touching her shoulder, more so when she sees it belongs to Lee Russell. He had hoped she would heed his warning, he says, but {{he was unable to}} fully transition back to her world to articulate the danger. What he is now was once her husband, but the Astro 7 crew was transformed by an unknown form of radiation. He ended up on this planet, the opposite of his former self—antimatter, by her definition.|$|E
50|$|Natasha {{comes in}} with the tramp Luka. She puts him in the kitchen to sleep with the three already there. Luka, a merry fellow, begins to sing, but he stops when all the others object. The whole group sits silent when Vassilisa comes in, sees the dirty floor, and gives orders for an {{immediate}} sweeping. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> the new arrival, Luka, and asks to see his passport. Because he has none, he is more readily accepted by the others. Miedviedeff, who is a policeman and Vassilisa’s uncle, enters the cellar {{to check up on}} the lodging. He begins to question Luka, but when the tramp calls him sergeant, Miedviedeff leaves him alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you ridiculous child!" [...] {{observed}} Mrs. Jellyby with an abstracted air as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{the dispatch}} last opened; [...] "what a goose you are!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{detected}} {{the anguish of}} a slow mind with an instinctive dread of obscure places wherein new discoveries can be made. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder to say: ...|$|R
60|$|Ellen posted her letter. She {{dropped it}} into the box thoughtfully, and thoughtfully {{returned}} to the flat. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder, but Constable Plimmer was out of sight.|$|R
50|$|Clinton Road in West Milford, Passaic County, New Jersey, is {{the subject}} of local {{folklore}} that includes alleged sightings of ghosts, strange creatures and gatherings of witches, Satanists and the Ku Klux Klan. Supposedly, if you go to one of the bridges at the reservoir and throw a penny into the water, within a minute it will be thrown back out to or at you by the ghost of a boy who drowned while swimming below or had fallen in while {{sitting on the edge of}} the bridge. In some tellings an apparition is seen; in others the ghost pushes the teller into the water if he or <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> the side of the bridge in order to save him.|$|E
5000|$|Like other Renaissance {{paintings}} of the Madonna and Child which include John the Baptist, the subject arises from a non-Biblical tradition that Virgin Mary and the Child Jesus met Christ's cousin St John the Baptist, on the Holy Family's Flight into Egypt. The Virgin is depicted with one breast bared, {{as if she has}} recently been suckling her infant son; this recalls the theme of the Virgin breastfeeding common in medieval painting. In her hands is a book (traditionally Isahia chapt. 53) which she attempts to hold away from her son, the contents of which probably foretell his future sacrifice and his taking over himself the evil of the world. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> her left shoulder onto a scroll being read by a pair of angels; this {{is likely to be the}} scroll reading Ecce Agnus Dei ('Behold the Lamb of God'), usually an attribute of John the Baptist.|$|E
50|$|Wayne is outraged {{about the}} truth {{and is about to}} shoot Katherine, when Adam enters the house. The two fight out of view, but Adam manages to wound Wayne. Katherine holds Wayne at gunpoint while Bree treats Adam's wounds. Wayne taunts Katherine, saying his friends on the force will ensure he will get out, and that he will never leave her alone. Katherine, realizing the truth of this, shoots Wayne in the chest, killing him. Bree rushes {{out of the house and}} asks her three friends to provide an alibi for Katherine. When the police {{question}} the four women, Katherine is in a trance-like state. The police conclude the shooting was in self-defense and release Katherine. As she walks out of her house free <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> the police line and sees her friends (Susan Delfino, Bree Hodge, Gabrielle Solis and Lynette Scavo) looking at her smiling. Katherine's daughter, Dylan, comes out of the crowd to confront her, in a loving way.|$|E
60|$|What was he doing? <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} upon the paper, and saw figures and signs. When he had jotted down something {{he went to}} the telescope again.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{the crowd}} with flaming audacity and stepped down. At Tommy’s request she stood upon the chair again, while he mounted the second chair and started the bidding.|$|R
60|$|She {{permitted}} {{herself to}} go to a motion-picture show. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> all the posters in front of the theater, and a train-wreck, a seaside love-scene, a detective drama, all invited her.|$|R

5000|$|The {{narrative}} {{returns to}} the snail, still trying to reach its goal. After making a decision on its progress, it moves off as a young couple approaches the flowerbed. The young man remarks that on Friday admission to the gardens is sixpence, to which she asks {{if it is not}} worth sixpence. He asks what [...] "it" [...] means. She replies [...] "anything." [...] As they stand {{at the end of the}} flowerbed, they both press the young woman's parasol into the soil. His hand rests on top of hers. This action expresses their feelings for each other, as do their insignificant words. The narrator states that these are words with [...] "short wings for their heavy body of meaning." [...] Their feelings are evident to the two of them as well as others. The young man speaks to the young woman, Trissie, telling her they should have their tea now. She asks where they have tea in the garden. As <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> a long grass path, she quickly forgets about the tea and wants to explore the gardens.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Klein is {{awakened by}} the sound of {{footsteps}} and animal growls. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> the drawings and the figures (the people) are gone. Suddenly, she sees people running back and forth inside the cave. She tries to get closer while asking whose there. Outside, the sheriff hears Dr. Klein scream. Rushing into the cave, he finds her face down with a spear in her back dead. The sheriff begins to explore the cave, but returns to the hole only to find Dr. Klein's body has vanished. He looks at the drawing to see a figure moving, pulling a dead figure with a spear in it. Then {{the other side of the}} drawing shows many figures with spears moving toward the other figure. He grabs some water and begins scrubbing the figures off the wall. As he is doing this, a primitive hunter appears behind him and begins to throw his spear. When the sheriff scrubs the figures off the wall, the primitive hunter disappears before the spear can hit him. After cleaning off the cave painting, the sheriff then heads to his truck and leaves.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} {{anything}} that could be altered," [...] Mrs. Harvey said, [...] "I have a dressmaker in the house now. She could easily do what you need. <b>She's</b> <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> my wardrobe." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was plain}} {{that in her}} opinion this respite had now lasted long enough. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} {{to make sure that}} she had closed the door, then leaned a little forward and spoke.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she had to}} ride between {{walls and}} villas, and lost sight of all till she emerged on the parade, and thought she saw Uncle Clement's hat above the crowd as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> their heads.|$|R
