5|$|Manitoba is the nation's largest {{producer}} of <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> and dry beans, {{and one of}} the leading sources of potatoes. Portage la Prairie is a major potato processing centre, and is home to the McCain Foods and Simplot plants, which provide French fries for McDonald's, Wendy's, and other commercial chains. Can-Oat Milling, one of the largest oat mills in the world, also has a plant in the municipality.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian Economic Union {{is the top}} {{producer}} of sugar beet and sunflower, producing 18.6% of the world's sugar beet and 22.7% of the world's sunflowers in 2012, {{as well as a}} top {{producer of}} rye, barley, buckwheat, oats and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed.</b> It is also a large producer of potatoes, wheat and grain (and grain legumes).|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed.</b> When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E
50|$|For {{commercial}} purposes, <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> {{are usually}} classified by the pattern on their husks. If the husk is solid black, the seeds are called black oil <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds.</b> The crops may {{be referred to}} as oilseed <b>sunflower</b> crops. These <b>seeds</b> are usually pressed to extract their oil. Striped <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> are primarily used for food; as a result, they may be called confectionery <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Less notable {{but equally}} {{important}} is the operation of Spitz International, originally Alberta <b>Sunflower</b> <b>Seeds,</b> which produces Spitz brand <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> and pumpkin seeds. These products are shipped worldwide. The majority of the <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> are produced locally, but the pumpkin seeds are produced in China.|$|R
5000|$|Seed feeders are {{the most}} common type of feeders. They can vary in design from tubes to hoppers and trays. <b>Sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> or mixed seeds are popular for use in these feeders and will attract many songbirds such as cardinals, finches, and chickadees. Black oil <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> are {{especially}} popular with bird enthusiasts. The outer shell of the black oil <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> are thinner and easier to crack than other types of <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds.</b> In addition, the kernel is larger than the striped or white <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds.</b> Black Oil <b>Sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> also contain a large amount of fat; therefore they are especially good to use in the winter. Most bird feeders are designed to dispense sunflower-sized foods, but there are specialty [...] "finch feeders" [...] with smaller openings to dispense the tiny Guizotia abyssinica (Niger seed), which is a favorite of smaller finches.|$|R
25|$|We {{have told}} about a certain canon of Polish bread. It {{would be wrong}} however to {{conclude}} that there's only one type of it which is worth mentioning. Each good bakery makes its bread slightly differently. Breads are made of various cereals (not just wheat or rye), whole grain breads abound and sometimes some traditional extra ingredients are used (e.g. onion, <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> or lard).|$|E
25|$|The {{fruit is}} an achene, similar to <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed,</b> {{with a single}} seed inside a hard outer hull. The starchy {{endosperm}} is white and makes up {{most or all of}} buckwheat flour. The seed coat is green or tan, which darkens buckwheat flour. The hull is dark brown or black, and some may be included in buckwheat flour as dark specks. The dark flour is known as blé noir (black wheat) in French, along with the name sarrasin (saracen).|$|E
25|$|Citrus fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, olive oil, and wine—Spain's {{traditional}} agricultural products—continued to {{be important}} in the 1980s. In 1983 they represented 12%, 12%, 8%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of the country's agricultural production. Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and dairy products. Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983. Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains. Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export. Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> oil that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the European Community.|$|E

2500|$|One {{of the few}} {{accounts}} of the Spix in captivity was given by Rev. F.G. Dutton, president of the Avicultural Society U.K. in 1900: [...] "I have not yet seen a good-tempered Spix... My Spix, which is really more a Conure than a Macaw, will not look at sop of any sort, except sponge cake given from one's fingers, only drinks plain water, and lives mainly on <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed.</b> It has hemp, millet, and canary, and peanuts, but I {{do not think it}} eats much of any of them. It barks the branches of the tree in which it is loose, and may eat the bark. It would very likely be all the better if it would eat bread and milk, as it might then produce some flight feathers, which it never yet has had. But I expect it would not eat any sop, even if I gave it nothing else." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{recent years}} farmers have been {{producing}} alternative crops which are economically viable, and amongst these are organic farm crops. [...] Hemp and wool from sheep {{are the main}} areas of fibre production of Canada. [...] Wool production was on average 16,022,000pounds (7,267t) in the 1930s and 9,835,000 pounds (4,461t) in 1949. Fibre flax from flaxseed has been exported to the United Kingdom. Crop growers may supplement their income with beeswax and honey and learn beekeeping. Enterprising land owners have had success growing as well as packaging and marketing the <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed.</b> Crops are not only for human consumption but also for animal consumption, which opens a new market such as canary seed. Cuniculture, or rabbit farming, is another livestock enterprise. Cannabis is an important crop in some areas, making up 5% of British Columbia's GDP. According to BC Business Magazine, the crop is worth $7.5 billion to the province annually, and gives employment to 250,000 people.|$|E
2500|$|Pumpkins {{that are}} still small and green may be eaten {{in the same way}} as squash or zucchini. [...] In the Middle East, pumpkin is used for sweet dishes; a {{well-known}} sweet delicacy is called halawa yaqtin. In South Asian countries such as India, pumpkin is cooked with butter, sugar, and spices in a dish called kadu ka halwa. Pumpkin is used to make sambar in Udupi cuisine. In Guangxi province, China, the leaves of the pumpkin plant are consumed as a cooked vegetable or in soups. In Australia and New Zealand, pumpkin is often roasted in conjunction with other vegetables. In Japan, small pumpkins are served in savory dishes, including tempura. In Myanmar, pumpkins are used in both cooking and desserts (candied). The seeds are a popular <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> substitute. In Thailand, small pumpkins are steamed with custard inside and served as a dessert. In Vietnam, pumpkins are commonly cooked in soups with pork or shrimp. In Italy, it can be used with cheeses as a savory stuffing for ravioli. Also, pumpkin can be used to flavor both alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages.|$|E

40|$|Pesticide {{residues}} {{are found}} in oilseeds and crude oils: they are mainly organophosphate insecticides (pirimiphos-methyl, dichlorvos, malathion) used in empty storage facilities and for application to stored cereal grains. Even if pests {{are found in}} stored oilseeds, French regulation does not permit use of these insecticides on stored oilseeds, as they have affinity for these lipophilic subtances. These residues arise from cross-contamination during mechanical contact with storage bins and grain handling equipment, and not from illegal use. This uptake of insecticide residues from their storage environment by oilseeds can lead to levels that exceed regulatory limits. An investigation of 11 grain storage companies allowed us to follow the course of 27 <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> batches, from reception at the storage facilities to outloading. Samples from each of these batches, made at outloading, were analysed content for insecticide residues. Traceability of <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> established by storers allowed us to identify the origine of observed cross-contamination cases. Substances discovered were dichlorvos, pirimiphos-methyl and malathion (and chlorpyriphos-methyl in a single case). Pirimiphos-methyl was most commonly detected, but most cases of non-accordance with regulatory levels were observed with dichlorvos and malathion. Main cross-contamination hazard resulted from treatment of cereals at outloading, just before <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> were outloaded, especially when these cereals treatments were frequent on that elevator. Other situations led to cross-contaminations, but generally of lower levels: outloading of <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> after outloading of cereal that was treated at the reception, several weeks or months before; <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> stored in bin that contained previously treated cereal; empty bins and handling equipment treated before receipt of <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds...</b>|$|R
