2500|$|The Mexican Armed Forces' {{policy on}} sexual {{orientation}} is ambiguous, leaving homosexual and bisexual soldiers in a [...] "legal limbo". Officially, {{there is no}} law or policy preventing homosexuals from serving, and applicants are not questioned on the subject. In practice, however, outed homosexual and bisexual soldiers are subject to severe harassment and are often discharged. One directive, issued in 2003, described actions [...] "en contra de la moral o de las buenas costumbres dentro y fuera del servicio [...] " [...] ("contrary to morality or good manners on- and off-duty") as <b>serious</b> <b>misconduct</b> warranting disciplinary action. Other references to morality are found throughout military documents, leaving room for interpretation with regards to sexual orientation. Although there is no clear position from current military leadership, several retired generals have agreed that homosexual soldiers were usually removed from service either through an encouraged withdrawal or dishonorable discharge.|$|E
2500|$|In general, BDSM play {{is usually}} {{structured}} {{such that it}} is possible for the consenting partner to withdraw his or her consent during a scene; for example, by using a safeword that was agreed on in advance. Use of the agreed safeword (or occasionally a [...] "safe symbol" [...] such as dropping a ball or ringing a bell, especially when speech is restricted) is seen by some as an explicit withdrawal of consent. Failure to honor a safeword is considered <b>serious</b> <b>misconduct</b> and could even change the sexual consent situation into a crime, depending on the relevant law, since the bottom or top has explicitly revoked his or her consent to any actions that follow the use of the safeword (see Legal status). For other scenes, particularly in established relationships, a safeword may be agreed to signify a warning ("this is getting too intense") rather than explicit withdrawal of consent; and a few choose not to use a safeword at all. This is sometimes the case for [...] "punishment scenes" [...] between master/slave couples or for some extreme or edgeplay scenes which may include abductions, rape play, or interrogation. This scene dynamic may be referred to as [...] "consensual nonconsent". In some scenes or relationships, it may be impossible for consent to be withdrawn {{in the middle of a}} scene, or the bottom may have the ability to revoke consent for a relationship as a whole, but not for a particular scene.|$|E
40|$|With women {{offenders}} representing {{only seven}} percent of the U. S. prison population, prevailing correctional policies {{continue to focus on}} the risk and needs of male offenders. However, in recent years, the female prison populations have increased more rapidly than male populations (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2005). Such rapid growth draws strong attention to existing practices of assessing and classifying women offenders (Van Voorhis, 2004). Current classification procedures involve the use of statistically-derived assessments that predict an offender’s likelihood of recidivism or an inmate’s likelihood of <b>serious</b> <b>misconducts.</b> They provide a risk score that determines the custody level of one’s prison assignment if incarcerated or level of community supervision if on probation or parole.

However, {{on the issue of}} <b>serious</b> professional <b>misconduct,</b> the Appeal Court panel was split 2:1 with the dissenting senior judge, Sir Anthony Clarke, concluding Meadow was [...] "guilty of serious professional misconduct" [...] and provided detailed reasons for his conclusion.

5000|$|On 24 May 2010, the GMC panel found Wakefield {{guilty of}} <b>serious</b> {{professional}} <b>misconduct</b> on four counts of dishonesty and 12 involving {{the abuse of}} developmentally challenged children, and ordered that he be struck off the medical register. John Walker-Smith was also found guilty of <b>serious</b> professional <b>misconduct</b> and struck off the medical register, but that decision was reversed on appeal to the High Court in 2012, because the GMC panel had failed to decide whether Walker-Smith actually thought he was doing research {{in the guise of}} clinical investigation and treatment. The High Court criticised [...] "a number of" [...] wrong conclusions by the disciplinary panel and its [...] "inadequate and superficial reasoning". Simon Murch was found not guilty.|$|R

Since, therefore, unless in case of personal culpability, {{there is no way of}} getting rid of them except by quartering them on the public as pensioners, it is of the greatest importance that the appointments should be well made in the first instance; and it remains to be considered by what mode of appointment this purpose can best be attained.|$|E

The commission considered this methodology scientifically irresponsible and a case of <b>serious</b> scientific <b>misconduct.</b> The commission considered these stories likely to be invented either by Bax or the informants. The commission was unable to interview these two informants, because one has died and the other one could not be found.

He was reinstated in 2006 after he appealed and the court ruled (2 to 1) that his actions in court had amounted to <b>misconduct</b> though not <b>serious</b> enough to warrant him being struck off.
