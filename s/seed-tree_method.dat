50|$|After {{the site}} has been {{successfully}} regenerated, seed trees may be commercially harvested or the trees may be retained for visual enhancement and as backup against catastrophic losses of regeneration due to agents such as fire or drought. The presence of seed trees distinguishes the <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method</b> from clearcutting. Many people consider the <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method</b> more aesthetically pleasing than clearcutting because some mature trees are retained on the site for at least until regeneration becomes well established.|$|E
50|$|<b>Seed-tree</b> <b>method</b> {{is usually}} applied to plants with a wind blown seed, rather not {{to those with}} hard seeds, like oak and beech that do not travel far from the {{originating}} tree.|$|E
50|$|Shelterwood is {{very similar}} to seed-tree as a {{regeneration}} method. Both use natural regeneration to create an even aged stand. However, the <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method</b> is focused on very few trees that will be wind dispersed. So for example red pine 25/ha, 7/ha for larch, 15-20/ha for Douglas fir.|$|E
50|$|This {{means that}} in shelterwood the trees will be removed at some time {{as part of the}} <b>method,</b> but with <b>seed-tree</b> <b>methods</b> there are so few that it is not {{necessary}} to make a cut just to remove them, they are more likely to be taken when performing a tending or thinning operation or other cut than a removal cut.|$|R
50|$|Seed {{trees are}} trees left after {{reproduction}} cutting to provide seeds for natural regeneration in the <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method.</b> These trees serve {{as both the}} gene source for the new crop of regeneration and {{as a source of}} timber during future cuttings. Because of its importance, a seed tree should be carefully chosen based upon both economic and biological factors. Selected seed trees should be the desired species, phenotypically superior, prolific in seeding and flowering, sturdy and healthy, free of damage, and of good growth form.|$|E
50|$|An even-aged {{regeneration}} {{method that}} retains widely spaced residual trees {{in order to}} provide uniform seed dispersal across a harvested area. In the <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method,</b> 2-12 seed trees per acre (5-30/ha) are left standing in order to regenerate the forest. They will be retained until regeneration has become established at which point they may be removed. It may not always be economically viable or biologically desirable to re-enter the stand to remove the remaining seed trees. Seed-tree cuts can also be viewed as a clearcut with natural regeneration and can also have all of the problems associated with clearcutting. This method is most suited for light-seeded species and those not prone to windthrow.|$|E
50|$|In general terms, the shelterwood {{system is}} a series of partial cuts that removes the trees of an {{existing}} stand over several years and eventually culminates in a final cut that creates a new even-aged stand. It is an even-aged regeneration method that removes trees in a series of three harvests: 1) Preparatory cut; 2) Establishment cut; and 3) Removal cut. The success of practising a shelterwood system is closely related to: 1. the length of the regeneration period, i.e. the time from the shelterwood cutting to the date when a new generation of trees has been established; 2.the quality of the new tree stand with respect to stand density and growth; and 3.the value increment of the shelter trees. Information on the establishment, survival and growth of seedlings influenced by the cover of shelter trees, {{as well as on the}} growth of these trees, is needed as a basis for modelling the economic return of practising a shelterwood system. The method's objective is to establish new forest reproduction under the shelter of the retained trees. Unlike the <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method,</b> residual trees alter understory environmental conditions (i.e. sunlight, temperature, and moisture) that influence tree seedling growth. This method can also find a middle ground with the light ambiance by having less light accessible to competitors while still being able to provide enough light for tree regeneration. Hence, shelterwood methods are most often chosen for site types characterized by extreme conditions, in order to create a new tree generation within a reasonable time period. These conditions are valid foremost on level ground sites which are either dry and poor or moist and fertile.|$|E
40|$|A {{stochastic}} {{optimization model}} is developed {{to make a}} selection between the planting method and the <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method,</b> {{taking into account the}} uncertainty of, and the legal requirement on, the stocking level of the established seedlings in a given year after regeneration action. Uncertainty is quantified as the variation of the mortality rate of planted seedlings for the planting method, and as the prediction error for the <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method.</b> The objective of the forest landowner is assumed to maximize the expected net present value (NPV). Numerical simulations show that the owner should prefer the <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method</b> to the planting method for Scots pine stand. However, if the risk-free selection model is used, it overestimates the expected NPV by about 2 %. Sensitivity analysis shows that a less restrictive forest act could improve the expected net present value both for the planting method and the <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method.</b> Sensitivity analysis also shows that decreasing the level of variation of the mortality rate (or prediction error) increases the expected NPV. ...|$|E
40|$|Research {{on natural}} {{regeneration}} {{is crucial for}} the development of sustainable forestry practices, in light of the global climate changes taking place. In this study, 151 plots were sampled in six Pinus pinaster stands that were naturally regenerated by the <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method</b> in Mediterranean forests in central Spain. The objectives of the survey were to study the suitability of different forest stands designated for natural regeneration as well as to analyse seedling establishment and the relationship between regeneration and different site factors. Analysis of variance and multivariate analysis with canonical ordination techniques were employed. Full and partial redundancy analyses on a correlation matrix were used to carry out a direct gradient analysis of regeneration density as a function of site factors. Nearly all stands presented seedling densities over 2, 000 seedlings ha− 1 and were thus found to be suitable for natural regeneration of Pinus pinaster by the seed-tree selection method. Significant variables that best explained total seedling and viable seedling density were spring and autumn precipitation of the year prior to establishment, spring and summer precipitation of the year of establishment and percentage cover of litter. There were no signs of competition between shrubs and seedlings, but a negative significant correlation with grass cover was observed. Pinus pinaster natural regeneration was successful with the <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method,</b> although it appeared to be highly dependent on climate and stand conditions.

40|$|Silvicultural systems {{integrate}} both regeneration {{and intermediate}} operations {{in an orderly}} process for managing forest stands. The clearcutting method of regeneration favors the development of species that are moderately intolerant to intolerant of shade. In fact, clearcutting is the most proven and widely used method of successfully regenerating bottomland oak species in the South. The <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method</b> of regeneration favors the establishment of light-seeded species. Mechanical soil scarification may be necessary if the desired species requires bare mineral soil for establishment. The shelterwood method of regeneration can provide {{for the development of}} heavy-seeded species, but has produced highly variable results with southern bottomland oaks. The single-tree selection method of regeneration favors the development of shade-tolerant species. When single-tree selection is applied repeatedly to stands containing commercially valuable shade-intolerant species, composition will gradually shift to less-valuable, more-tolerant species. Consequently, the single-tree selection method of regeneration is not recommended for any commercially valuable bottomland hardwood tree species. Group selection, in its strictest application, creates only small openings that usually fail to allow sufficient light to the forest floor for satisfactory establishment and development of shade-intolerant bottomland species. Patch cutting, a combination of uneven-aged (group selection) and even-aged (clearcutting) silviculture, designed to create larger openings, has been successfully used to produce an uneven-aged stand that consists of many small, irregularly shaped, even-aged groups...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{management}} in Sweden {{can be characterized}} by even-aged silviculture heavily relying on three established harvest regimes: clearcutting, the <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method,</b> and the shelterwood system. Less intense, small-scale retention harvest systems such as single tree and group selection harvest are rarely used. In addition, natural regeneration dynamics without enrichment planting have barely been studied. Consequently, this study examined natural regeneration establishment in a multi-layered Pinus sylvestris-Picea abies forest stand in southwest Sweden after target diameter harvesting and soil scarification. The creation of forest canopy gaps had {{a positive effect on}} total seedling density five years after harvest, mainly due to a significantly higher number of Betula pendula individuals. Seedling density of more desirable tree species suitable for continuous cover forestry such as Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea and Picea abies also increased substantially in gaps when compared to pre-harvest conditions or the unharvested plots. In contrast, soil scarification did not increase the number of seedlings of desired tree species due to a significant decrease in Picea abies abundance. Soil moisture and gap size significantly improved Betula pendula seedling establishment while a larger number of Quercus petraea seedlings were observed in Vaccinium myrtillus patches. We conclude that canopy gaps are beneficial under the encountered stand conditions to initiate forest regeneration, and that soil scarification without the timely occurrence of a mast year of desired tree species is not effective in the type of forest studied...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out on Cupressus lusitanica {{plantations}} at Beldong Forest, Jebel Marra, Western Sudan to evaluate {{the performance of the}} natural regeneration of Cupressus Lusitanica as affected by various local site factors (Plateau, Slope and Depression). Growth and survival rates of natural regeneration were determined and analyzed to determine the most suitable measures to be adopted in such conditions in favor of natural regeneration compared to the nursery seedlings produced at relatively high cost. For natural regeneration trials, the sample plots were selected from all over the forest using completely Randomized Block Design. The study showed that, site significantly affects the depth to which roots can penetrate, hence has significant effect on the growth and survival of Cupressus Lusitanica regeneration. The analysis showed that, there is an increase in organic matter content as moving from the top {{to the bottom of the}} plateau in depression areas. This has resulted in a good performance in height growth and rate of survival of the natural regeneration from ridges towards depression. The same holds for the old plantations. Natural regeneration of C. lusitanica in plateau occurs in patches and in very dense clusters, but mortality rate was very high, almost about 75 % died because of shallow soil and high competition between seedlings. The study recommended that, <b>seed-tree</b> <b>method</b> for C. lusitanica in the area is the suitable method for the natural regeneration together with prescribed burning...|$|E
