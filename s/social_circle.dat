5|$|During this time, his <b>social</b> <b>circle</b> grew {{to include}} William Cameron Edwards. Through Edwards, Rutherford was {{introduced}} to the Birkett family, which included former Member of Parliament Thomas Birkett. Rutherford married Birkett's niece, Mattie Birkett, in December 1888. The couple had three children: Cecil (born in 1890), Hazel (born in 1893), and Marjorie (born in 1903, but died sixteen months later). Rutherford had a traditional view of gender roles, and was happy to leave most child-rearing responsibilities to his wife.|$|E
5|$|La Peau de chagrin firmly {{established}} Balzac {{as a writer}} of significance in France. His <b>social</b> <b>circle</b> widened significantly, and he was sought eagerly by publishers for future projects. The book served as the catalyst {{for a series of}} letters he exchanged with a Polish baroness named Ewelina Hańska, who later became his wife. It also inspired Giselher Klebe's opera Die tödlichen Wünsche.|$|E
5|$|At the German Embassy in Washington, D.C., on January 2, 1873, Savage {{married the}} aristocratic Anna Josephine Scheible, a German widow {{three years older}} than he who had arrived in war-torn America in 1864 with her first husband, Gustav, to look after family-owned land in Georgia. Gustav Scheible died in 1866 and Anna became a {{favorite}} of the Washington <b>social</b> <b>circle.</b> Her marriage to Savage produced one daughter, who later married Anatol de Carriere, a minor nobleman and an Imperial Russian Councilor of State.|$|E

5|$|In 1878, Lorne was {{appointed}} Governor General of Canada. Louise became viceregal consort, but her stay was unhappy {{as a result}} of homesickness and dislike of Ottawa. Following Victoria's death in 1901, Louise entered the <b>social</b> <b>circle</b> established by her brother, the new king, Edward VII. Louise's marriage survived thanks to long periods of separation; the couple reconciled in 1911 and she was devastated by her husband's death in 1914. After the end of the First World War in 1918, at the age of 70, she began to retire from public life, undertaking few public duties outside Kensington Palace, where she died at age 91.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Green flees {{her wedding}} day and seeks out {{childhood}} friend Monica Geller, a New York City chef. They become roommates, and Rachel joins Monica's <b>social</b> <b>circle</b> of single people in their mid-20s: struggling actor Joey Tribbiani, business professional Chandler Bing, masseuse and musician Phoebe Buffay, and newly divorced paleontologist Ross Geller, Monica's older brother. To support herself, Rachel becomes a waitress at Central Perk, a Manhattan coffeehouse where the group often hangs out; when not there, the six are usually at Monica and Rachel's nearby West Village apartment, or Joey and Chandler's across the hall.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's {{first three}} years in the Senate were unremarkable. McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many {{different}} organizations, covering a wide range of topics. His aides and many in the Washington <b>social</b> <b>circle</b> described him as charming and friendly, and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties. He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a small circle of colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|After {{he wrote}} the pilot, he {{approached}} actors for the main characters. Christopher Eccleston was Davies' first choice {{for the role of}} Stuart Jones; Eccleston declined because of his age and suggested his friend Aidan Gillen instead. The roles of Vince Tyler and Nathan Maloney were quickly given to Craig Kelly and Charlie Hunnam, and the secondary character Alexander Perry, originally written for the television producer Phil Collinson during his brief acting career, was portrayed by Antony Cotton, who later played the gay character Sean Tully in Coronation Street. The series was allocated a £3,000,000 budget, and was produced by Red Productions, owned by his friend and former colleague Nicola Shindler, and filmed by Cracker and Hillsborough director Charles McDougall and The Grand director Sarah Hardin on location in Manchester. The eight 40-minute episodes emulated experiences from his social life and includes an episode where the minor character Phil Delaney (Jason Merrells) dies of a cocaine overdose, unnoticed by his <b>social</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Anne Crewe's great-grandson, John Crewe (1742–1829), {{was created}} the first Baron Crewe in 1806. A {{prominent}} Whig politician, he was a lifelong friend and supporter of Charles James Fox; his wife Frances Crewe (née Greville; 1748–1818) was a famous beauty and political hostess who gave lavish entertainments at the hall. The Crewes' <b>social</b> <b>circle</b> included many of the major figures of the day, and visitors to the hall during this period included politicians Fox and George Canning, philosopher Edmund Burke, playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, poet William Spencer, musicologist Charles Burney, and artists Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence. John Crewe had the park landscaped and the hall extended, and also had the interior remodelled in the neo-Classical style then fashionable. Some forty years later, his grandson Hungerford Crewe (1812–94) went to considerable expense to have the interiors redecorated in a more sympathetic Jacobethan style.|$|E
5|$|Eva Anna Paula Hitler (née Braun; 6 February 1912– 30 April 1945) was the {{longtime}} companion of Adolf Hitler and, for fewer than 40 hours, his wife. Braun met Hitler in Munich {{when she was}} a 17-year-old assistant and model for his personal photographer; she began seeing him often about two years later. She attempted suicide twice during their early relationship. By 1936, she was a part of his household at the Berghof near Berchtesgaden and lived a sheltered life throughout World War II. Braun was a photographer, and many of the surviving colour photographs and films of Hitler were taken by her. She was a key figure within Hitler's inner <b>social</b> <b>circle,</b> but did not attend public events with him until mid-1944, when her sister Gretl married Hermann Fegelein, the SS liaison officer on his staff.|$|E

5|$|Fellini secured {{financing}} {{through the}} producers Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti, {{who wanted to}} cast Silvana Mangano (De Laurentiis' wife) as Gelsomina and Burt Lancaster as Zampanò, but Fellini refused these choices. Giulietta Masina had been {{the inspiration for the}} entire project, so Fellini was determined never to accept an alternative to her. For Zampanò, Fellini had hoped to cast a nonprofessional and, to that end, he tested a number of circus strongmen, to no avail. He also had trouble finding the right person for the role of Il Matto. His first choice was the actor Moraldo Rossi, {{who was a member of}} Fellini's <b>social</b> <b>circle</b> and had the right type of personality and athletic physique, but Rossi wanted to be the assistant director, not a performer. Alberto Sordi, the star of Fellini's earlier films The White Sheik and I Vitelloni, was eager to take the role, and was bitterly disappointed when Fellini rejected him after a tryout in costume.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 4 December 1979, 22-year-old Teresa DeSimone had been working as a {{part-time}} barmaid in the Tom Tackle public house (now called The Encore public house) in Commercial Road, Southampton. By day she was employed as a full-time clerk for the Southern Gas Board. She had been employed at the pub {{for less than a}} month, working two evenings each week, partly to widen her <b>social</b> <b>circle</b> and partly to supplement her income to pay for the Ford Escort car that she had bought three months previously. The pub was located centrally in the city, only 50yards (46metres) from the police station and law courts, and near the city's central train station and the Gaumont Theatre (now The Mayflower). When her shift at the Tom Tackle ended at 23:00 (11:00p.m.) she went on to a night club in nearby London Road, in the company of her friend Jenni Savage. Although the discothèque was a relatively short distance from the public house, they travelled in Savage's car, leaving DeSimone's Ford Escort in the pub car park.|$|E

25|$|The dual-sphere {{nature of}} women’s work, in {{household}} domestic labor, {{and in the}} marketplace, allowed for both additional opportunities at financial resources {{as well as a}} larger <b>social</b> <b>circle</b> than their male counterparts.

Among Brazilian-born adult ex-slaves in Salvador in the 18th century, 60% were women.|$|E
