5|$|Resolution was {{provided}} by the same 1989 study that confirmed the link between Xenopsaris and Pachyramphus. In it, Xenopsaris and six other genera previously held in the three families were found to actually form a fourth family, later named Tityridae. This new family is where the genus is now placed by the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society. A 2007 study of mitochondrial DNA confirmed the white-naped xenopsaris' place in the Tityridae, and its close relationship to Pachyramphus, as well as the genus Tityra. These three genera were found to be more distantly related to a fourth genus Iodopleura (the purpletufts), although further <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> to understand the complete relationship between these four genera.|$|E

5|$|Redback {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the milking of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse immune systems makes polyclonal antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with pepsin, and the active F(ab')2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback antivenom in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough to inactivate 5mg of redback spider venom in a test tube. The antivenom has been safely administered to women {{in various stages of}} pregnancy. Redback antivenom has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for its effectiveness has been lacking. Recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> to confirm or refute its effectiveness. It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by Steatoda spiders; however, as these cases are often mild and the evidence of its effectiveness is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the antivenom has been reported as effective with bites of L. katipo, and L. tredecimguttatus. Animal studies also support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from L. mactans, L. hesperus, and L. tredecimguttatus (synonym L.lugubris).|$|E

40|$|This {{comparative}} {{study examined the}} leadership role of art department chairpersons in selected midwestern four-year colleges and universities. It compared the leadership role of the art department chairperson to his/her immediate supervisor's perception of that same role. Literature relating to leadership and leader behavior for chairpersons in administration and art education administration was reviewed. The Leadership Behavior Description Questionnaire-Ideal (LBDQ-Ideal) and a demographic data survey were used. A {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) was used to measure statistical significance in Initiating Structure and Consideration. The population comprised forty-one colleges and universities with enrollments of 3500 or more students in eight midwestern states. Responses <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> from each art department chairperson and his/her immediate supervisor to have matched pairs for the study. Art department chairpersons were sent a demographic data survey to identify their specific environment and background. CONCLUSIONSThere is no significant statistical difference in the leadership role of art department chairpersons and their immediate supervisors' perceptions of that same role using the LBDQ-Ideal in the subscale areas of Initiating Structure and Consideration. RECOMMENDATIONS(1) A <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> to develop and incorporate into existing art education specific programs for art department chairpersons and/or or art administrators and for those interested in becoming an art department chairperson. (2) A <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> to develop strategies to increase the awareness of fellow staff and immediate supervisors as to the role and responsibilities of art department chairpersons. (3) A <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> to develop in-service and pre-service training programs to emphasize the importance of skill development in both task-related (Initiating Structure) and people-related (Consideration) dimensions of effective educational leadership.

25|$|Although {{the link}} between {{attachment}} styles and marital satisfaction has been firmly established, the mechanisms by which attachment styles influence marital satisfaction remain poorly understood.

MS analyzers are useful in these studies because of their shorter analysis time, and higher sensitivity and specificity compared to UV detectors commonly attached to HPLC systems.

As long as there are no interferences or ion suppression, the LC separation can be quite quick.|$|E
