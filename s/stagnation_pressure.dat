Unstart can be {{alternatively}} thought of {{in terms of a}} decreasing <b>stagnation</b> <b>pressure</b> inside of a supersonic duct; whereby the upstream <b>stagnation</b> <b>pressure</b> is greater than the downstream <b>stagnation</b> <b>pressure.</b> Unstart is also the result of a decreasing throat size in supersonic ducts. That is the entrance throat is larger than the diffusing throat. This change in throat size gives rise to the decreasing mass flow which defines unstart.|$|E

This anomaly appears to be fundamentally related to the two-phase process and not merely to the present specific nozzle geometry. The fluid appears to be metastably all liquid below the saturation pressure. The data are compared to various flow models. No model adequately describes the whole range of the experiment...|$|R

25|$|An {{airspeed}} indicator is a {{differential pressure gauge}} with the pressure reading expressed in units of speed, rather than pressure. The airspeed {{is derived from the}} difference between the ram air pressure from the pitot tube, or <b>stagnation</b> <b>pressure,</b> and the static pressure. The pitot tube is mounted facing forward; the static pressure is frequently detected at static ports on one or both sides of the aircraft. Sometimes both pressure sources are combined in a single probe, a pitot-static tube. The static pressure measurement is subject to error due to inability to place the static ports at positions where the pressure is true static pressure at all airspeeds and attitudes. The correction for this error is the position error correction (PEC) and varies for different aircraft and airspeeds. Further errors of 10% or more are common if the airplane is flown in “uncoordinated” flight.|$|E

[...] The pitot tube is most often located on the wing or front section of an aircraft, facing forward, where its opening is exposed to the relative wind.

2500|$|Supersonic flow behaves very {{differently}} from subsonic flow. Fluids react {{to differences in}} pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is [...] "told" [...] to respond to its environment. Therefore, since sound is in fact an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, {{the speed of sound}} in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that [...] "information" [...] can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself {{in the case of a}} fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a <b>stagnation</b> <b>pressure</b> as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid [...] "knows" [...] the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties – temperature, density, pressure, and Mach number—in an extremely violent and irreversible fashion called a shock wave. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see Reynolds number) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes.|$|E
