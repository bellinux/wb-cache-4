25|$|B-trees have {{substantial}} advantages over alternative implementations {{when the time}} to access the data of a node greatly exceeds the time spent processing that data, because then the cost of accessing the node may be amortized over multiple operations within the node. This usually occurs when the node data are in <b>secondary</b> <b>storage</b> such as disk drives. By maximizing the number of keys within each internal node, {{the height of the}} tree decreases and the number of expensive node accesses is reduced. In addition, rebalancing of the tree occurs less often. The maximum number of child nodes depends on the information that must be stored for each child node and the size of a full disk block or an analogous size in <b>secondary</b> <b>storage.</b> While 2-3 B-trees are easier to explain, practical B-trees using <b>secondary</b> <b>storage</b> need a large number of child nodes to improve performance.|$|E
25|$|Tries can be slower in {{some cases}} than hash tables for looking up data, {{especially}} if the data is directly accessed on a hard disk drive or some other <b>secondary</b> <b>storage</b> device where the random-access time is high compared to main memory.|$|E
25|$|Introduced by IBM in 1956, HDDs {{became the}} {{dominant}} <b>secondary</b> <b>storage</b> device for general-purpose computers {{by the early}} 1960s. Continuously improved, HDDs have maintained this position into the modern era of servers and personal computers. More than 200 companies have produced HDDs historically, though after extensive industry consolidation most current units are manufactured by Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital. HDD unit shipments and sales revenues are declining, though production (exabytes per year) is growing. Flash memory has a growing {{share of the market}} for <b>secondary</b> <b>storage,</b> in the form of solid-state drives (SSDs). SSDs have higher data-transfer rates, higher areal storage density, better reliability, and much lower latency and access times. Though SSDs have higher cost per bit, they are replacing HDDs where speed, power consumption, small size, and durability are important.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{processors}} have made enormous gains in speed. But {{increase in the}} speed of the <b>secondary</b> and tertiary <b>storage</b> devices could not cope with these gains. The result is that the <b>secondary</b> and tertiary <b>storage</b> access times dominate execution time of data intensive computations. Therefore, in scientific computations, efficient data access functionality for data stored in <b>secondary</b> and tertiary <b>storage</b> is a must. In this extended abstract, we give an overview of PART, a runtime library {{that can be used in}} applications that process tape-resident data. We present user interface and underlying optimization strategy. We also discuss performance improvements provided by the library on the High Performance Storage System (HPSS). The preliminary results reveal that the optimizations can improve response times by up to 97 : 2 %. ...|$|R

40|$|Flywheels are {{excellent}} <b>secondary</b> energy <b>storage</b> devices and several applications in road vehicles are under development. They {{can be used}} in hybrid vehicles with an internal combustion engine (ICE) as the prime mover or {{can be used in}} hybrid energy storage (HES) to complement the battery. When used in HES, they are utilized to load level the battery so as to protect it from peak loads and enhance its capacity and life. This paper deals with defining the main characteristics of the flywheel for an application as a <b>secondary</b> energy <b>storage</b> device for an electric vehicle. Various strategies for defining flywheels are explained. A real world customer usage data is also presented.

25|$|As {{the number}} of {{independent}} processors in a supercomputer increases, the way they access data in the file system and how they share and access <b>secondary</b> <b>storage</b> resources becomes prominent. Over the years a number of systems for distributed file management were developed, e.g., the IBM General Parallel File System, BeeGFS, the Parallel Virtual File System, Hadoop, etc. A number of supercomputers on the TOP100 list such as the Tianhe-I use Linux's Lustre file system.|$|E
25|$|One {{more recent}} {{application}} for flash memory is {{as a replacement}} for hard disks. Flash memory does not have the mechanical limitations and latencies of hard drives, so a solid-state drive (SSD) is attractive when considering speed, noise, power consumption, and reliability. Flash drives are gaining traction as mobile device <b>secondary</b> <b>storage</b> devices; they are also used as substitutes for hard drives in high-performance desktop computers and some servers with RAID and SAN architectures.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} IBM PC market (1981â€“83) the major {{programming}} tool vendors all made compilers that {{worked in a}} similar fashion. For example, the Microsoft Pascal system consisted of two compiler passes and a final linking pass (which could take minutes on systems with only floppy disks for <b>secondary</b> <b>storage,</b> although programs were very much smaller than they are today). This process was less resource-intensive than the later integrated development environment (IDE). Vendors of software development tools aimed their products at professional developers, and the price for these basic tools plus ancillary tools like profilers ran into the hundreds of dollars.|$|E

50|$|Soon {{after the}} {{discovery}} of the SWNHs, the scientists made efforts to study the structure of this new material. In 2000, a detailed X-ray diffraction examination showed that the interhorn-wall distance was 0.4 nm, greater than the interlayer spacing of graphite (0.335 nm). Thus SWNH aggregates should have both microporosity and mesoporosity originating from the above specific structure. An exact surface characterization of SWNHs can extend the application possibilities to <b>secondary</b> energy <b>storage.</b>|$|R
25|$|The first {{commercial}} computer was the Ferranti Mark 1, built by Ferranti and {{delivered to the}} University of Manchester in February 1951. It {{was based on the}} Manchester Mark 1. The main improvements over the Manchester Mark 1 were {{in the size of the}} primary storage (using random access Williams tubes), <b>secondary</b> <b>storage</b> (using a magnetic drum), a faster multiplier, and additional instructions. The basic cycle time was 1.2 milliseconds, and a multiplication could be completed in about 2.16 milliseconds. The multiplier used almost a quarter of the machine's 4,050 vacuum tubes (valves). A second machine was purchased by the University of Toronto, before the design was revised into the Mark 1 Star. At least seven of these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957, one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam.|$|E
500|$|Joel Hruska of ExtremeTech criticized {{continuing}} integration problems {{between the}} Desktop and apps on Windows 8.1, pointing out examples {{such as the}} Photos app, which [...] "still refuses to acknowledge that users might have previous photo directories", and that the Mail app [...] "still canâ€™t talk to the desktopâ€”if you try to send an email from the Desktop without another mail client installed, Windows will tell you thereâ€™s no mail client capable of performing that action." [...] However, he praised the improvements to other apps, such as People and News (pointing out UI improvements, and the News app using proper links when sharing stories, rather than non-standard links {{that can only be}} recognized by the app). Although praising the more flexible snapping system, he still pointed out flaws, such as an inability to maintain snap configurations in certain situations.

500|$|Later on, critics {{felt that}} the Xbox One's {{functionality}} had matured over the year following its launch; Jeff Bakalar of CNET, assigning it a score of 8/10, acknowledged improvements to Xbox One's software since its original release, but that its user interface was still unintuitive in comparison to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 4, explaining that [...] "navigating the interface seems {{to be much more}} problematic than it rightfully should be, and there's simply not enough transparency in the logic within it. There are oddities peppered throughout, which is the root for countless headaches and frustrations." [...] Xbox One's in-game performance was mixed, with some titles showing slower performance over PS4, but some multi-platform games performing better on Xbox One than PS4. CNET praised the wider lineup of multimedia services and apps on Xbox One over PS4, not requiring Xbox Live Gold for online save data storage, support for high-speed USB 3.0 as <b>secondary</b> <b>storage,</b> and having a [...] "slightly better" [...] lineup of upcoming exclusives, concluding that [...] "While the PS4 had a clear advantage at launch, that edge is slowly evaporating as Microsoft has worked feverishly to undo most of the Xbox One's original missteps." ...|$|E

40|$|MEMS {{storage devices}} are new {{non-volatile}} <b>secondary</b> <b>storages</b> that have outstanding advantages over magnetic disks. MEMS storage devices, however, are {{much different from}} magnetic disks in the structure and access characteristics. They have thousands of heads called probe tips and provide the following two major access facilities: (1) flexibility: freely selecting a set of probe tips for accessing data, (2) parallelism: simultaneously reading and writing data with the set of probe tips selected. Due to these characteristics, it is nontrivial to find data placements that fully utilize the capability of MEMS storage devices. In this paper, we propose a simple logical model called the Region-Sector (RS) model that abstracts major characteristics affecting data retrieval performance, such as flexibility and parallelism, from the physical MEMS storage model. We also suggest heuristic data placement strategies based on the RS model and derive new data placements for relational data and two-dimensional spatial data by using those strategies. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed data placements improve the data retrieval performance by up to 4. 0 times for relational data and by up to 4. 8 times for two-dimensional spatial data of approximately 320 Mbytes compared with those of existing data placements. Further, these improvements are expected to be more marked as the database size grows. ...|$|R
2500|$|Endianness {{refers to}} the {{sequential}} order in which bytes are arranged into larger numerical values, when stored in computer memory or <b>secondary</b> <b>storage,</b> or when transmitted over digital links. Endianness is of interest in computer science because two conflicting and incompatible formats are in common use: words may be represented in big-endian or little-endian format, depending on whether bits or bytes or other components are ordered from the big end (most significant bit) or the little end (least significant bit).|$|E
2500|$|An {{improved}} algorithm [...] {{supports a}} single pass down the tree from the root to the node where the insertion will take place, splitting any full nodes encountered on the way. This prevents {{the need to}} recall the parent nodes into memory, which may be expensive if the nodes are on <b>secondary</b> <b>storage.</b> However, to use this improved algorithm, we {{must be able to}} send one element to the parent and split the remaining Uâˆ’2 elements into two legal nodes, without adding a new element. This requires U = 2L rather than U = 2Lâˆ’1, which accounts for why some textbooks impose this requirement in defining B-trees.|$|E
