50|$|When {{the candy}} level gets too high, Hoss clicks his car unlock system, which causes a giant saw car (spoof of the Gotengo from Godzilla: Final Wars) to <b>drill</b> <b>out</b> of the ground. They escape and devise {{a plan to}} attack the Underworld.|$|R
5000|$|Potential {{resources}} — Potential {{resources are}} those that exist in a region and {{may be used in}} the future. For example, petroleum occurs with sedimentary rocks in various regions, but until the time it is actually <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> and put into use, it remains a potential resource.|$|R
5000|$|Potential {{resources}} {{are known to}} exist and {{may be used in}} the future. For example, petroleum may exist in many parts of India and Kuwait that have sedimentary rocks, but until the time it is actually <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> and put into use, it remains a potential resource.|$|R
5000|$|The {{underwater}} stage lift {{was produced}} by Handling Specialty. [...] In order for the platform stage to rise and fall in the water without a wake, {{the surface of the}} stage has thousands of tiny holes which were <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> by the Cirque du Soleil team.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Drilling</b> <b>out</b> {{components}} was {{a popular}} way to lighten racing bicycle components in the 1970s. Eddy Merckx's hour record-winning bike has heavily-drilled handlebars and chainring. Cyclists jokingly refer to the incorporation of [...] "drillium" [...] in the machine, {{as if it were}} an exotic metal which confers lightness.|$|R
5000|$|An auger is a {{drilling}} device, or drill bit, that usually includes a rotating helical screw blade called a [...] "flighting" [...] {{to act as}} a screw conveyor to remove the <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> material. The rotation of the blade causes the material {{to move out of the}} hole being drilled.|$|R
50|$|Reamers are {{stabilizers}} {{that have}} cutting elements embedded on their fins, {{and are used}} to maintain a gauged well-bore. They {{can be used to}} <b>drill</b> <b>out</b> doglegs and key-seats in hard formations. Due to the cutting ability of the reamer the bit does less work in maintaining well-bore gauge and more work drilling.|$|R
5000|$|Such an {{operation}} is often also called hyperbolic Dehn filling, as Dehn surgery proper {{refers to a}} [...] "drill and fill" [...] operation on a link which consists of <b>drilling</b> <b>out</b> a neighborhood of the link and then filling back in with solid tori. Hyperbolic Dehn surgery actually only involves [...] "filling".|$|R
5000|$|... “How {{can you not}} grin, or laugh hysterically (as much of the {{audience}} did) as he pulls a <b>drill</b> <b>out</b> to carve sticks that become his dancers, {{and then at the}} end of the show, magically, a fully jointed foot. Ward is thoroughly engaging, a seasoned performer…” Deirdre Towers, The Dance Enthusiast, May 2015.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes, the {{existing}} lighting on a vehicle {{is modified to}} create warning beacons. In the case of wig-wag lighting, this involves adding a device to alternately flash the high-beam headlights, or, in some countries, the rear fog lights. It can also involve <b>drilling</b> <b>out</b> other lights on the vehicle to add ‘hideaway’ or ‘corner strobes’.|$|R
50|$|The screw {{is first}} <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> {{to the proper}} {{diameter}} for that extractor. The extractor is then inserted into this hole and turned counter-clockwise using a tap wrench. As the extractor is turned, the flutes on the tool dig into the screw, causing it to lock tightly and apply sufficient torque to remove the screw.|$|R

50|$|At 250 tonnes, the {{original}} block of marble had its centre <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> in the Michelangelo quarry {{to reduce its}} weight {{as far as possible}} for transportation down the steep winding road to the Michelangelo Studio, Carrara. This in itself was a feat of logistics and required careful planning and patience to ensure it reached the studio safely.|$|R
50|$|A {{coiled tubing}} truck {{is used to}} deploy {{continuous}} tubing into an oil or gas well. They are normally used for well cleanouts (both over balanced or jetvac underbalanced, plug pulling or <b>drill</b> <b>outs,</b> fishing, spotting of acid or cement, installation of umbilicals such as flatak, or instrument and camera runs in vertical or horizontal oil and gas wells.|$|R
50|$|After {{being fired}} from L&H Turner found work flying for a small <b>drilling</b> company <b>out</b> of Midland, Texas. George Beverly Barham ran an oil <b>drilling</b> company <b>out</b> of Louisiana that was doing work in the oil fields of west Texas near the panhandle. Barham had a Stinson that Turner piloted for him flying out of Midland, Texas.|$|R
50|$|The bikes Engers rode pioneered {{lightweight}} techniques, frequently featuring <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> brakes, chainwheels {{and other}} components. The bikes were often {{designed and built}} by his friend and mentor, the late Alan Shorter. It was not uncommon for Engers {{to arrive at a}} morning event with a Shorter bicycle frame built the previous night and thus unpainted.|$|R
50|$|Installation of MLS {{systems in}} multi-screened cased wells {{simplifies}} the decommissioning process for all systems, {{which is one}} reason why such installations are becoming popular. Having a smooth, low-friction, consistent inside-diameter pipe surrounding the MLS system simplifies removal of the MLS components. The multi-screened well casing can then be decommissioned using standard methods such as pressure grouting or by <b>drilling</b> <b>out</b> the casing.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{repairing}} cracks or damaged areas in glass, in particular, glass coatings provided on tile. The method includes removing the damaged area using a high speed diamond burr <b>drilling</b> <b>out</b> a cavity that extends slightly {{into the base}} material of the tile. All loose material is then cleaned from the <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> cavity and the cavity is filled adjacent the upper surface of the coating with a filler material including chopped silica fibers mixed with a binder. The filler material is packed into the cavity and a repair coating is applied {{by means of a}} brush or sprayed thereover. The repair includes borosilicate suspended in solution. Heat is applied at approximately 2100 F. for approximately five minutes for curing the coating, causing boron silicide particles of the coating to oxidize forming a very fluid boron-oxide rich glass which reacts with the other frits to form an impervious, highly refractory layer...|$|R
50|$|The {{canonical}} decomposition allows SnapPea to tell two cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds {{apart by}} turning the problem of recognition into a combinatorial question, i.e. checking if the two manifolds have combinatorially equivalent canonical decompositions. SnapPea is also able to check if two closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds are isometric by <b>drilling</b> <b>out</b> short geodesics to create cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds and then using the canonical decomposition as before.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} downhole motors in the Tiwi geothermal field in the Philippines, The discussion includes the application Of a Dyna-Drill with insert-type bits for drilling through surface alluvium. The economics {{of this type of}} drilling are compared to those of conventional rotary drilling. The paper also {{describes the}} use of a turbodrill that <b>drills</b> <b>out</b> scale as the well produces geothermal fluids...|$|R
5000|$|An {{escutcheon}} {{can also}} refer to {{an item of}} door furniture. In this case, it is an architectural item that surrounds a keyhole or lock cylinder, and is often part of a lockset. Escutcheons help to protect a lock cylinder from being <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> or snapped, {{and to protect the}} surrounding area from damage and wear {{from the end of the}} key when it misses the keyhole.|$|R
5000|$|Practitioners may {{recommend}} detoxification as {{a treatment}} to address the notion that mercury poisoning arises from consumption of contaminated fish and from dental amalgam fillings - Quackwatch states: [...] "Removing good fillings {{is not merely a}} waste of money. In some cases, it results in tooth loss because when fillings are <b>drilled</b> <b>out,</b> some of the surrounding tooth structure will be removed with it.".|$|R
50|$|A suet feeder is {{typically}} a metal cage-like construction {{with a plastic}} coating that contains a cake or block of suet to feed woodpeckers, flickers, nuthatches, and many other species of insect eaters. Suet logs are also very common. These wooden logs have holes <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> for suet to be inserted. Suet is high in fat which helps to keep birds warm and nourished during the cold winter.|$|R
50|$|Dominion {{took over}} {{operations}} of the prospect and on March 8, 2005 spudded the Dawson 34-3 No. 1 well 970 ft west of the Young #1 well. After <b>drilling</b> <b>out</b> from under the surface pipe, they encountered their first good gas kick at 2510 ft, which was flared to the pit. The second major gas show was encountered at 3510 ft, when the well exploded with a huge fire ball.|$|R
2500|$|A bit used {{to enlarge}} an {{existing}} hole {{is called a}} core drill bit. The existing hole {{may be the result}} of a core from a casting or a stamped (punched) hole. [...] The name comes from its first use, for <b>drilling</b> <b>out</b> the hole left by a foundry core, a cylinder placed in a mould for a casting that leaves an irregular hole in the product. This core drill bit is solid.|$|R
30|$|Result in Fig.  14 {{suggests}} that the backfilling improve the pillar stability. This could be caused by confinement effect of backfilling and the infiltration of backfilling slurry content into the failure zone improves mechanical properties of the broken pillars. In order to examine the behavior of backfilled pillars, modeled pillar was set up and tested in the laboratory. Cylindrical cores were <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> and prepared to simulate pillar models from Ainoura sandstone block sample.|$|R

50|$|Major Hathaway begins {{interrogating}} Olham. As he's {{about to}} <b>drill</b> <b>out</b> his chest {{to find the}} bomb, Olham breaks loose and escapes, accidentally killing his friend Nelson in the process. With the help of underground stalker Cale, Olham avoids capture and sneaks into the hospital where his wife Maya is an administrator to get the high-tech scan redone and prove he's not a replicant. But the scan is interrupted by security forces before it can deliver the answer.|$|R
40|$|Drill-press jig used {{to remove}} {{improperly}} installed rivets. Drillpress jig makes possible to drill accurately-centered, straight holes through rivets. Key component of jig is a drill bushing with spherical recess machined into base. Contour of recess matches contour of rivet head. Operator holds jig handle {{with one hand}} and controls drill with other. Handle and screw head hold drill bit in place over center of rivet so rivet <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> through its axis. With rivet removed, parts separated and refastened or reused elsewhere...|$|R
50|$|Straight fluted extractors {{may come}} in a kit that also has {{associated}} drills, drill bushings, and special nuts, or be sold individually. The screw is <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> with the appropriate drill and drill bushing. The extractor is then hammered into the hole with a brass hammer, because a steel hammer will cause the extractor to break. The appropriate special nut is then attached {{to the end of}} the extractor. The nuts can then be turned with a wrench to remove the screw.|$|R
50|$|In some countries, for {{instance}} in Germany, wall boxes for electrical fittings generally are not actual rectangular boxes at all but standard-sized round recessed containers. This has the advantage that the corresponding round holes can be simply <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> with a hole saw rather than needing the cutting out of a rectangular shape to accommodate the wall box. Even with those round-hole systems, the faceplates that cover them are mostly rectangular however. Round-hole systems {{do not appear to}} be common in the English-speaking world.|$|R
50|$|In early 1947, Superior Oil {{erected a}} {{drilling}} and production platform in 20 ft of water some 18 mi off Vermilion Parish, La. But it was Kerr-McGee Oil Industries (now Anadarko Petroleum), as operator for partners Phillips Petroleum (ConocoPhillips) and Stanolind Oil & Gas (BP) that completed its historic Ship Shoal Block 32 well in October 1947, months before Superior actually drilled a discovery from their Vermilion platform farther offshore. In any case, that made Kerr-McGee's well the first oil discovery <b>drilled</b> <b>out</b> {{of sight of}} land.|$|R
