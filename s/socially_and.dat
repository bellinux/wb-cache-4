The dam has been controversial both domestically and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Following their Star Search audition, Johnny and the Moondogs {{changed their}} name to Japage 3 (combining letters {{from each of}} the member's names: John, Paul, and George).

5|$|Languages express meaning by {{relating}} a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must {{be something}} that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention.

5|$|Volcanic {{ash fall}} is physically, <b>socially,</b> <b>and</b> {{economically}} disruptive. Volcanic ash can affect both proximal areas and areas {{many hundreds of}} kilometres from the source, and causes disruptions and losses {{in a wide variety}} of different infrastructure sectors. Impacts are dependent on: ash fall thickness; the duration of the ash fall; the grain size and chemistry of the ash; whether the ash is wet or dry; and any preparedness, management and prevention (mitigation) measures employed to reduce effects from the ash fall. Different sectors of infrastructure and society are affected in different ways and are vulnerable to a range of impacts or consequences. These are discussed in the following sections.|$|E

5|$|Article 15 prohibits {{discrimination}} on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them. This right can be enforced against the State as well as private individuals, with regard to free access to places of public entertainment or places of public resort maintained partly or wholly out of State funds. However, the State is not precluded from making special provisions for women and children or any <b>socially</b> <b>and</b> educationally backward classes of citizens, including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment and prevents the State from discriminating against anyone in matters of employment on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, place of residence or any of them. It creates exceptions for the implementation of measures of affirmative action for the benefit of any backward class of citizens in order to ensure adequate representation in public service, as well as reservation of an office of any religious institution for a person professing that particular religion.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Stojanović was {{contracted}} to the Prijedor {{branch of the}} state railway company to provide healthcare for its employees. In 1936, he was {{contracted to}} an iron ore mining company in Ljubija, a town near Prijedor, and would visit the mining company clinic twice a week. He also taught hygiene at the gymnasium in Prijedor. Together with other intellectuals from the town, he gave lectures to the miners at their club in Ljubija. His lectures were usually about medical issues, but he also described {{the economic and social}} position of workers in more advanced countries. He socialised with the miners and treated their family members for free. He was very active <b>socially,</b> <b>and</b> also participated in sports. In 1932, he founded the tennis club of Prijedor, which continues to bear his name. Stojanović once bought new kit for all members of the Rudar Ljubija football club. His contracts with the railway company and the mining company were both terminated in 1939. The railway employees protested in Prijedor, and Stojanović's contract with that company was subsequently renewed.|$|E
