5|$|Upon {{tropical}} cyclogenesis on 5December, {{the surrounding}} atmospheric conditions were generally favorable for continued development, however, a northeasterly wind flow generated wind shear, somewhat inhibiting development and partially exposing Sam's low level center of circulation as it tracked westward. Over {{the following two}} days, however, the tropical cyclone's rainbands were able to fully enclose the center of circulation. During the evening hours of 6December, however, Sam began to interact with a shortwave trough, causing the cyclone to curve southward and towards the northwestern coast of Australia. Over the following day, an eye started to form and Sam began to rapidly intensify. At 0400UTC, the storm attained Category3 cyclone intensity on the Bureau of Meteorology cyclone scale. Ten hours later, Category4 intensity was achieved. At the time, <b>Sam</b> <b>had</b> featured an eye measuring 30mi (40km) in diameter. Objective Dvorak intensity analysis gave the system a rating of 7.7, corresponding to an estimated intensity of 215km/h (135mph). Around the same time, Sam briefly became stationary before resuming its southward trek. Continuing to intensify, TCWC Perth upgraded the cyclone to Category5 intensity at 2000UTC, with winds of 195km/h (120mph) and a minimum pressure of 950hPa (mbar; 28.06inHg). However, in post-storm analysis, it was analyzed that <b>Sam</b> <b>had</b> had in fact peaked with winds of 205km/h (125mph) and a minimum pressure of 935 hPa (mbar; 27.61 inHg). The JTWC rated the storm as a Category3 hurricane on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale. At the same intensity, Sam made landfall near Lagrange, Western Australia at 1300UTC on 8December. Upon moving ashore, Sam began to slowly weaken over the Great Sandy Desert. On 9December, the JTWC ceased the monitoring of the system, as the weakened Sam began to curve eastward. After {{a brief period of}} restrengthening over central Australia on 13December, Sam finally weakened below tropical cyclone intensity the following day before dissipating shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins in}} an {{abandoned}} warehouse, where Dean (Ackles) is attacked by the djinn that he is hunting. He suddenly finds himself {{in a world in}} which his mother (Smith) was not killed by the demon Azazel. He and his brother Sam (Jared Padalecki) were not raised to be hunters of supernatural creatures, but are no longer close, as Dean is irresponsible, disloyal, and drinks too much in this alternate reality; when a confused Dean calls him for help, Sam thinks that he is drunk. In the new reality, Dean is dating the beautiful Carmen (Michelle Borth), and Sam is at law school and engaged to Jessica (Palicki)another victim of Azazel. Although Dean enjoys his new life, a ghostly young woman seems to be haunting him and he is confronted by an image of corpses in his closet.

25|$|In The Return of the King, Sam single-handedly rescued Frodo from Cirith Ungol and, {{dressed in}} {{scavenged}} Orc-armour, the two {{began to make}} their way across the plateau of Gorgoroth. They finally arrived, against all odds, at Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring could be destroyed. However, Gollum had secretly followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and <b>Sam</b> <b>had</b> almost reached their destination, Gollum attacked them, but Frodo threw him down. Sam faced Gollum on his own, letting Frodo continue up the mountain to finish their mission. Like Bilbo and Frodo before him, Sam spared Gollum's life out of pity, and turned his back on the beaten (but still wily) creature and followed Frodo.|$|E

Back in Walford Sam tries to {{continue}} her fling with David and when this goes nowhere she tries to come between Ricky and his girlfriend, Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). Initially Ricky thinks he still has feelings for Sam, but eventually realises he is better off with Bianca and tries to let Sam down gently.

Despite this, Ricky will not reconsider getting back with Sam and opts to try to make amends with Bianca. Sam is forced to admit defeat. Soon after, she meets a Spanish man named Guillermo, who is holidaying in England. When he invites her to join him in Spain she leaps at the chance and leaves Walford again in March 1996.|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{explanation}} is that he needed another adventure to delay Frodo and Sam, because the episode at Cirith Ungol {{was moved to the}} third movie, and so a new climax was needed. In fact, according to the timeline given by Tolkien, Frodo and <b>Sam</b> <b>had</b> only reached the Black Gate {{at the time of the}} fall of Isengard. Jackson also argues that it was necessary for Faramir to be tempted by the Ring because in his films everyone else was tempted, and letting Faramir be immune would be inconsistent in the eyes of a film audience. Co-screenwriter Philippa Boyens and actor David Wenham defended the changes to Faramir's character in order to increase dramatic tension: Faramir's [...] "sea-green incorruptible" [...] nature in the book would not have [...] " [...] well filmically". Wenham (who had not read the book until after filming had commenced) also found Tolkien's original [...] "dramatically dead".|$|E
500|$|In 1925, {{the studio}} {{expanded}} its operations and acquired the Brooklyn-based theater company, Vitagraph. Later that year, Sam Warner urged his brother, Harry, {{to sign an}} agreement with Western Electric to develop a series of talking [...] "shorts" [...] using the newly developed Vitaphone technology. Sam died of pneumonia in 1927 (just before the premiere of the first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer), and Jack became sole head of production. Sam's death left Jack inconsolable. One biographer writes, [...] "Throughout his life, Jack had been warmed by Sam's sunshiny optimism, his thirst for excitement, his inventive mind, his gambling nature. <b>Sam</b> <b>had</b> {{also served as a}} buffer between Jack and his stern eldest brother, Harry. In the years to come, Jack ran the Warner Bros. Burbank studio with an iron hand. Following his brother's death, he became increasingly difficult to deal with and inspired the resentment of many of his employees.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{also had}} a brief sexual relationship with hospital Lothario Sam Strachan. She and <b>Sam</b> <b>had</b> a one night stand in episode [...] "The Borders of Sleep", {{and went on to}} become close friends, with Maddy assisting Sam in caring for a teenage prostitute he felt responsible for. She also supported him through his Non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, and enlisting his support in illegally proving a patient's death through negligence. In the show's tenth series, Maddy also formed a fast respect for the new head of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit, Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow). Pow ruled out a romance between the two characters, however, stating: [...] "They're protective of each other, but they're more like brother and sister than anything else. I don't think he's ready for the relationship merry-go-round at Holby just yet". He added that: [...] "Any man would be a fool to turn down Maddy, but Linden wants his wife back". Similarly, Lewington has assessed that neither Sam nor Linden are Maddy's ideal man, and instead she is [...] "waiting for a new hunk!" ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was some}} puzzlement {{expressed}} by several reviewers, including Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal and Votta, {{as to why}} Finn would think <b>Sam</b> <b>had</b> been such a great performer to begin with {{that it was so}} important to bring him back. Despite that, Votta was pleased by Sam's return as was Bell, who thought {{it was one of the}} more enjoyable aspects of the episode. Sam's scene with Blaine, however, was met with criticism, but of Blaine's characterization, not Sam's: BuddyTV John Kubicek pointed out that Blaine [...] "essentially calls Sam a whore" [...] and that [...] "he's like a completely different person". Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger described the scene as [...] "pretty out of character" [...] for Blaine, and The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said that the entire subplot, including Finn's antagonism toward Blaine, was [...] "so sloppily assembled" [...] he was glad it was ended in the following scene. The confrontation between Kurt and Sebastian over Blaine was little remarked onâ€”West enjoyed it, but said she had been hoping for more.|$|E
