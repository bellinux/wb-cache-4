50|$|The IBM 1311 Disk <b>Storage</b> <b>Drive</b> was {{announced}} on October 11, 1962 and {{was designed for}} use with several medium-scale business and scientific computers. The 1311 was about {{the size and shape}} of a top-loading washing machine and stored 2 million characters (12,000,000 bits) on a removable IBM 1316 disk pack. Seven models of the 1311 were introduced during the 1960s. They were withdrawn during the early 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The term render {{farm was}} born during the {{production}} of the Autodesk 3D Studio animated short The Bored Room in July 1990 when, to meet an unrealistic deadline, a room filled with Compaq 386 computers was configured to do the rendering. At the time the system wasn't networked so each computer had to be set up by hand to render a specific animation sequence. The rendered images would then be 'harvested' via a rolling platform to a large-format optical <b>storage</b> <b>drive,</b> then loaded frame by frame to a Sony CRV disc.|$|E

30|$|When {{used with}} the Raspberry Pi, most tested class 6 and class 10 flash <b>storage</b> <b>drives</b> provide a {{significant}} better data rate for sequential write compared with the class 4 drives. The sequential read performance of all tested drives {{is limited by the}} maximum data rate of the storage card interface, the Raspberry Pi Model B is equipped with. The SD card interface on the Raspberry Pi implements a 4 -bit data bus and 50  MHz clock rate. Therefore, the theoretical maximum data rate is 25  MB/s, which cannot be reached in practice. For comparison, the data rate of the flash <b>storage</b> <b>drives</b> for sequential read and write was also measured with the internal Realtek RTS 5227 PCI Express card reader of a Lenovo ThinkPad X 240 notebook. The results in Table  4 show that the maximum data rate of the tested class 10 drives for sequential read is more than double the data rate, the drives provide in the Raspberry Pi.|$|R

5000|$|The KIM-1 {{included}} {{a somewhat more}} complex built-in Terminal Interface Monitor software called TIM that was [...] "contained in 2048 bytes of ROM in two 6530 ROM/RAM/IO arrays". This monitor software included the ability to run a cassette tape for <b>storage,</b> <b>drive</b> the LED display, and run the keypad. As soon as the power was turned on, the monitor would run and the user could immediately start interacting with the machine via the keypad. The KIM-1 {{was one of the}} first single-board computers, needing only an external power supply to enable its use as a stand-alone experimental computer. This fact, plus the relatively low cost of getting started, made it quite popular with hobbyists through the late 1970s.|$|E

50|$|Most server {{oriented}} software automated tiered storage vendors offer tiering as {{a component}} of a general storage virtualization stack offering, an example being Microsoft with their Tiered Storage Spaces. However, automated tiering is now becoming a common part of industry standard operating systems such as Linux and Microsoft Windows, {{and in the case of}} consumer PCs, Apple OSX with its Fusion Drive. This solution allowed a single SSD and hard disk drive to be combined into a single automated tiered <b>storage</b> <b>drive</b> that ensured that the most frequently accessed data was stored on the SSD portion of the virtual disk. A more OS agnostic version was introduced by Enmotus which supports real-time tiering with its FuzeDrive product for Linux and Windows operating systems, extending support to storage class memory offerings such as NVDIMM and NVRAM devices.|$|E

50|$|Another {{selling point}} of {{proprietary}} DVR systems is compression. Video compression removes information {{in exchange for}} a smaller file size. Increasing compression leads to the ability to store longer periods on a disk, at the expense of sacrificing some of the detail in the images.

As <b>storage</b> <b>drives</b> become cheaper and larger, compression sacrifices are improving.|$|R
