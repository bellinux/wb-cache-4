25|$|In {{the context}} of OA, the most {{attractive}} intra- articular sites for gene transfer are the <b>synovium</b> and the articular cartilage. Most experimental {{progress has been made}} with gene transfer to a convenient intra-articular tissue, such as the <b>synovium,</b> a tissue amenable to genetic modification by a variety of vectors, using both in vivo and ex vivo protocols.|$|E
25|$|During {{pregnancy}} {{women experience}} CTS due to hormonal changes (high progesterone levels) and water retention (which swells the <b>synovium),</b> which are common during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The {{indirect}} {{ex vivo approach}} involves {{harvest of}} <b>synovium,</b> isolation and culture of synoviocytes, in vitro transduction, and injection of engineered synovicytes into the joint.|$|E
25|$|While using MRI, true lesions at the rotator {{interval}} region {{between the}} parts of the supraspinatus and subscapularis are all but impossible to distinguish from normal <b>synovium</b> and capsule.|$|E
25|$|This {{contributes}} to local inflammation in a joint, specifically the <b>synovium</b> with edema, vasodilation and entry of activated T-cells, mainly CD4 in microscopically nodular aggregates and CD8 in microscopically diffuse infiltrates.|$|E
25|$|The disease {{progresses}} {{by forming}} granulation tissue {{at the edges}} of the synovial lining, pannus with extensive angiogenesis and enzymes causing tissue damage. The <b>synovium</b> thickens, cartilage and underlying bone begin to disintegrate and the joint is getting destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Genes may be {{delivered}} to <b>synovium</b> in animal models of RA and OA by direct, in vivo injection of vector or by indirect, ex vivo methods involving autologous synovial cells, skin fibroblasts, or other cell types such as mesenchymal stem cells.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{advances}} in ultrasonography like high-frequency transducers (10MHz or higher) have improved the spatial resolution of ultrasound images depicting 20% more erosions than conventional radiography. Color Doppler and power Doppler ultrasound {{are useful in}} assessing the degree of synovial inflammation as they can show vascular signals of active synovitis. This is important, since {{in the early stages}} of RA, the <b>synovium</b> is primarily affected, and synovitis seems to be the best predictive marker of future joint damage.|$|E
25|$|However, during {{onset of}} osteoarthritis, the {{collagen}} matrix becomes more disorganized {{and there is}} a decrease in proteoglycan content within cartilage. The breakdown of collagen fibers results in a net increase in water content. This increase occurs because whilst there is an overall loss of proteoglycans (and thus a decreased osmotic pull), it is outweighed by a loss of collagen. Without the protective effects of the proteoglycans, the collagen fibers of the cartilage can become susceptible to degradation and thus exacerbate the degeneration. Inflammation of the <b>synovium</b> (joint cavity lining) and the surrounding joint capsule can also occur, though often mild (compared to the synovial inflammation that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis). This can happen as breakdown products from the cartilage are released into the synovial space, and the cells lining the joint attempt to remove them.|$|E
2500|$|Cartilaginous bodies or osteocartilaginous {{bodies with}} central {{ossification}} may be noted. [...] They are typically spherical in shape. [...] Sizes range from several millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. [...] The <b>synovium</b> of the involved joint demonstrates villous hyperplasia, which imparts a wrinkled appearance on gross examination. [...] There may be cartilaginous bodies {{attached to the}} <b>synovium.</b> [...] Synovial involvement may be focal or diffuse in nature.|$|E
2500|$|The direct in vivo {{approach}} is intra-articular insertion of a vector to affect synovicytes. Vectors play crucial role in success of this method. [...] The effect of Different vectors for in vivo gene delivery to <b>synovium</b> is summarized in Table 2: ...|$|E
2500|$|In this condition, {{cartilaginous}} metaplasia {{takes place}} within the synovial membrane of the joint. Metaplastic <b>synovium</b> organizes into nodules. [...] With minor trauma, nodules are shed as small bodies into the joint space. [...] In some patients, the disease process may involve tendon sheaths and bursal sacs.|$|E
2500|$|Synovial {{osteochondromatosis}} (SOC) (synonyms include synovial chondromatosis, primary synovial chondromatosis, synovial chondrometaplasia) is a {{rare disease}} that creates a benign change or proliferation in the <b>synovium</b> or joint-lining tissue, which changes to form bone-forming cartilage. [...] In most occurrences, {{there is only one}} joint affected, either the knee, the hip, or the elbow. Rarely involves the TMJ.|$|E
2500|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{degenerative}} {{joint disease}} {{which is the}} western world's leading cause of pain and disability. [...] It {{is characterized by the}} progressive loss of normal structure and function of articular cartilage, the smooth tissue covering the end of the moving bones. This chronic disease not only affects the articular cartilage but the subchondral bone, the <b>synovium</b> and periarticular tissues are other candidates. People with OA can experience severe pain and limited motion. OA is mostly the result of natural aging of the joint due to biochemical changes in the cartilage extracellular matrix.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{structures}} {{within the}} joint {{can also be}} affected. The ligaments within the joint become thickened and fibrotic and the menisci can become damaged and wear away. Menisci can be completely absent {{by the time a}} person undergoes a joint replacement. New bone outgrowths, called [...] "spurs" [...] or osteophytes, can form on the margins of the joints, possibly in an attempt to improve the congruence of the articular cartilage surfaces {{in the absence of the}} menisci. The subchondral bone volume increases and becomes less mineralized (hypomineralization). All these changes can cause problems functioning. The pain in an osteoarthritic joint has been related to thickened <b>synovium</b> and subchondral bone lesions.|$|E
2500|$|Transient {{synovitis}} {{of the hip}} (also called toxic synovitis; {{see below}} for more synonyms) is a self-limiting condition {{in which there is}} an inflammation of the inner lining (the <b>synovium)</b> of the capsule of the hip joint. The term irritable hip refers to the syndrome of acute hip pain, joint stiffness, limp or non-weightbearing, indicative of an underlying condition such as transient synovitis or orthopedic infections (like septic arthritis or osteomyelitis). In everyday clinical practice however, irritable hip is commonly used as a synonym for transient synovitis. [...] It {{should not be confused with}} sciatica, a condition describing hip and lower back pain much more common to adults than transient synovitis but with similar signs and symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rheumatoid}} nodule, {{which is}} {{sometimes in the}} skin, {{is the most common}} non-joint feature and occurs in 30% of people who have RA. It is a type of inflammatory reaction known to pathologists as a [...] "necrotizing granuloma". The initial pathologic process in nodule formation is unknown but may be essentially the same as the synovitis, since similar structural features occur in both. The nodule has a central area of fibrinoid necrosis that may be fissured and which corresponds to the fibrin-rich necrotic material found in and around an affected synovial space. Surrounding the necrosis is a layer of palisading macrophages and fibroblasts, corresponding to the intimal layer in <b>synovium</b> and a cuff of connective tissue containing clusters of lymphocytes and plasma cells, corresponding to the subintimal zone in synovitis. The typical rheumatoid nodule may be a few millimetres to a few centimetres in diameter and is usually found over bony prominences, such as the elbow, the heel, the knuckles, or other areas that sustain repeated mechanical stress. Nodules are associated with a positive RF (rheumatoid factor) titer, ACPA, and severe erosive arthritis. Rarely, these can occur in internal organs or at diverse sites on the body.|$|E
50|$|Just {{beneath the}} intima, most <b>synovium</b> has a dense net of {{fenestrated}} small blood vessels that provide nutrients {{not only for}} <b>synovium</b> {{but also for the}} avascular cartilage.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{inflamed}} <b>synovium</b> {{is accompanied}} by extra macrophage recruitment (as well as the existing type A cells), fibroblast proliferation and an influx of inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, monocytes and plasma cells. When this happens, the <b>synovium</b> can interfere with the normal functioning of the joint. Excessive thickened <b>synovium,</b> filled with cells and fibrotic collagenous tissue, can physically restrict joint movement. The synovial fibroblasts may make smaller hyaluronan {{so it is a}} less effective lubricant of the cartilage surfaces. Under stimulation from invading inflammatory cells, the synovial cells may also produce enzymes (proteinases) that can digest the cartilage extracellular matrix. Fragments of extracellular matrix can then further irritate the <b>synovium.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The inner {{lining of}} the joint {{consists}} of the <b>synovium</b> (also called the synovial membrane), a thin layer located between the joint capsule and the joint cavity. The word [...] "synovium" [...] {{is derived from the}} word [...] "synovia" [...] (or synovial fluid), which is a clear, viscous fluid produced by the <b>synovium,</b> and its main purpose is to reduce friction between the joint cartilages during movement. <b>Synovium</b> is also important to maintain proper joint function by providing the structural support and supply of the necessary nutrients to the surrounding cartilage. Synovial membrane is divided into two compartments - the outer layer (subintima) and the inner layer (intima). The inner layer is mainly composed of two cell types, specialized macrophages (macrophage-like synovial cells) and fibroblast-like synoviocytes, which are important in maintaining the internal joint homeostasis. These cells represent the main source of hyaluronic acid and also other glycoproteins, major components of the synovial fluid.|$|E
