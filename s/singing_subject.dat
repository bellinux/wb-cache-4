2500|$|Rabbi Shapiro's primary argument, {{based on}} the {{language}} of this baraita as well as traditional commentaries to it, was that women were only discouraged from performing public Torah reading based on a social concern for {{the dignity of the}} congregation ("Kevod HaTzibur"). While Jewish law usually demands that public rituals be led by those who are obligated in that particular ritual- and women are generally considered to be not obligated in public Torah reading- R. Shapiro demonstrated that public Torah reading is an exception, {{based on the}} baraita's explicitly allowing a minor, who is also not obligated, to lead. therefore, he argued, only [...] "the dignity of the congregation" [...] was invoked to discourage women from reading. He then analyzed the weight of the [...] "dignity of the congregation" [...] prohibition. Analyzing authorities on the law of Kevod HaTzibur, he noted a number of other situations which were rabbinically prohibited due to the [...] "dignity of the congregation", such as rolling a Torah scroll in front of the congregation or having a person too young to have a beard serve as Hazzan. Citing authorities who held that congregational dignity could be waived in some of these matters, including the common practice of having teenagers lead the congregation in contemporary synagogues, he concluded that a congregation could waive its dignity on this issue as well, and an Orthodox congregation choosing to do so could call a woman to the Torah {{in much the same way}} that it could choose to have a teenager lead prayers at a Bar Mitzvah. Rabbi Shapiro also briefly addressed certain other objections, arguing for example that because some authorities have held that women can read the Megilla on Purim to men, chanting the Megilla, and hence the Torah, is not a kind of <b>singing</b> <b>subject</b> to restrictions on the issue of kol isha, the female singing voice.|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} interrelations of voice, body and {{technology}} in popular music from a musicological perspective. It {{is an attempt to}} outline a systematic approach to the history of music technology with regard to aesthetic aspects, taking the identity of the <b>singing</b> <b>subject</b> as a main point of departure for a hermeneutic reading of popular song. Although the argumentation is based largely on musicological research, it is also inspired by the notion of presentness as developed by theologian and media scholar Walter Ong. The variety of the relationships between voice, body, and technology with regard to musical representations of identity, in particular gender and race, is systematized alongside the following cagories: (1) the “absence of the body,” that starts with the establishment of phonography; (2) “amplified presence,” as a signifier for uses of the microphone to enhance low sounds in certain manners; and (3) “hybridity,” including vocal identities that blend human body sounds and technological processing, whereby special focus is laid on uses of the vocoder and similar technologies...|$|E

This practice-based, artistic {{research}} unpacks the entangled {{process of}} making new music, conscious that the performer-author is the site where embodied problem solving takes place. The principal focus of {{the paper is the}} author’s realization of Alexander Garsden’s [ja] Maser, for voice and electronics, created by recording and reconstituting vocal elements using traditional compositional and performative methods as well as studio recording and granular synthesis. The author approaches the realization of this new work as an experimental practice in dialogue with theoretical frames that inform and situate the research. 2 ̆ 2 The grain of the voice 2 ̆ 2 (Barthes) is a central theoretical touch-point for this case-study which also engages with ideas derived from texts by Connor, Deleuze and Guattari, Dolar, Chion, Auslander, Cavarero and Harraway. The author contends that theoretical grounding can be utilized to support and parse vocal practice, mediated by technology and the collaborative process, to more effectively negotiate performer subjectivity in the realization of new music. The results of these investigations through artistic research provide insight into the approaches a performer might devise to solve practical and philosophical problems in new electro-acoustic music while negotiating the granular, unstable nature of subjectivity...|$|E

40|$|The idea of {{political}} community is appealing on a gut-level. Hayek suggested that certain genes and instincts still dispose us toward the ethos and {{mentality of the}} hunter-gatherer band, and that modern forms {{of political}} collectivism have, in part, been atavistic reassertions of such tendencies. Picking up on Hayek, Klein (2005) has suggested a combination of yearnings: 1) a yearning for coordinated sentiment (like Smithian sympathy); and 2) a yearning that the sentiment encompass the whole group. This paper reports on an experiment designed to explore the demand for encompassment by having <b>subjects</b> <b>sing</b> together. In each trial, {{one person in the}} room was designated not to sing unless every one of the others in the room had made a payment sufficient so as to have that person <b>sing.</b> <b>Subjects</b> chose to sacrifice money to achieve encompassment 47. 4 percent of the time, with 59. 6 percent of the subjects doing so in at least one trial. An exit questionnaire showed that subjects' chief reason for making such a sacrifice was a belief that the singing would be more enjoyable if it encompassed the whole group, and reported enjoyment is significantly higher with encompassment. We discuss the experiment as a parable for a penchant toward political collectivism. Encompassment, political psychology, Hayek, the people's romance...|$|R

40|$|Evidence for the {{absolute}} nature of long-term auditory memory {{is provided by}} analyzing the production of familiar melodies. Additionally, a two-component theory of absolute pitch is presented, which conceives of this rare ability as consisting of a more common ability, pitch memory, and a separate, less common ability, pitch labeling. Forty-six <b>subjects</b> <b>sang</b> two different popular songs and their productions were compared to the actual pitches used in recordings of those songs. 40 % of the <b>subjects</b> <b>sang</b> the correct pitch {{on at least one}} trial; 12 % of the subjects hit the correct pitch on both trials, and 44 % came within two semitones of the correct pitch on both trials.

The Arcadians resolved to return to the fields of truth, always <b>singing</b> of <b>subjects</b> of pastoral simplicity and drawing their inspiration from Greco-Roman bucolic poetry. The ideal parameters for the artistic work were simplicity and a sense of measure and beauty. Common to all the poets was the desire to oppose the poetry of the Marinists, and return to classic poetry, embracing also the recent rationalist influence of Descartes. Norms and rituals of the academy took their cue from classic and pastoral mythology, as in the custom of assuming 'pastoral' names; (Crescimbeni, for example, chose that of Alfesibeo Cario). The fourteen founder members included the librettist Silvio Stampiglia.|$|R

40|$|Karaoke {{singing is}} a very popular {{entertainment}} among young people in Asia. It is a leisure singing activity with the singer's voice amplified with special acoustic effects in the backdrop of music. Music video and song captions are shown on television screen to remind the singers during singing. It {{is not uncommon to}} find participants singing continuously for four to five hours each time. As most of the karaoke singers have no formal training in singing, these amateur singers are more vulnerable to developing voice problems under these intensive singing activities. This study reports the performance of 20 young amateur singers (10 males and 10 females, aged between 20 - 25 years) on a series of phonatory function tasks carried out during continuous karaoke singing. Half of the singers were given water to drink and short duration of vocal rests at regular intervals during singing and the other half sang continuously without taking any water or rest. The subjects who were given hydration and vocal rests sang significantly longer {{than those who did not}} take any water or rest. The voice quality, as measured by perceptual and acoustic measures, and vocal function, as measured by phonetogram, did not show any significant changes during <b>singing</b> in the <b>subjects</b> who were given water and rest during the <b>singing.</b> However, <b>subjects</b> who <b>sang</b> continuously without drinking water and taking rests showed significant changes in the jitter measure and the highest pitch they could produce during singing.
