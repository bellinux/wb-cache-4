5|$|Barrhill flourished {{until about}} 1885, when {{population}} in the village itself peaked at 50, and two effects caused a population decline. Firstly, a recession set in across New Zealand that made people move to where work opportunities presented themselves, and locally those opportunities were created near the stations of the Methven Branch railway. Wason began to gradually <b>sell</b> <b>off</b> parts of his land holdings from the mid-1880s.|$|E

5|$|Lesser Hampden is a {{football}} stadium located immediately beside {{the western end}} of Hampden Park. The ground was constructed in the early 1920s after additional ground was purchased to expand the main stadium. Queen's Park proposed in 1990 to <b>sell</b> <b>off</b> Lesser Hampden to fund redevelopment works on the main stadium, but this was rejected by planners. It is used by Queen's Park for training, reserve team matches and youth football. Lesser Hampden was refurbished for use as a warm-up area during the 2014 Commonwealth Games.|$|E
5|$|Rensselaerswyck {{continued}} {{as a legal}} entity until the mid-1840s, having survived Dutch and British colonial times, even being given a special patent by Queen Anne to confirm the patroon's fiefdom upon British takeover of the area. The end of the manor came with the Anti-Rent War, when many tenants rose against the successors of Stephen Van Rensselaer III (who had died in 1839), having much influence on the Legislature elections of the time, and eventually intimidating the Van Rensselaer family enough to <b>sell</b> <b>off</b> most of its holdings.|$|E

5|$|Bass moved {{production}} of Stones to its Burton upon Trent and Tadcaster breweries. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing interests, including their breweries and the Stones brand to the Belgian brewer Interbrew. Interbrew contracted the {{production of}} cask conditioned Stones to Marston's in Burton. Competition concerns forced Interbrew to <b>sell</b> <b>off</b> certain brands in December 2001, including Stones Bitter, which was bought by the American Coors Brewing Company (later Molson Coors). Molson Coors currently produce keg Stones Bitter at their brewery in Tadcaster, and the canned version at their Burton brewery. The cask product was initially contract brewed at the Highgate Brewery in Walsall, West Midlands, before moving to Everards of Leicester in 2005. The cask product ceased production in June 2012.|$|E

5|$|Cope {{had little}} formal {{scientific}} training, and he eschewed a teaching position for field work. He made regular {{trips to the}} American West, prospecting in the 1870s and 1880s, often {{as a member of}} United States Geological Survey teams. A personal feud between Cope and paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh led to a period of intense fossil-finding competition now known as the Bone Wars. Cope's financial fortunes soured after failed mining ventures in the 1880s, forcing him to <b>sell</b> <b>off</b> much of his fossil collection. He experienced a resurgence in his career {{toward the end of his}} life before dying on April 12, 1897.|$|E
5|$|In 1774, the {{government}} of Prince Edward Island passed the Quit Rent Act 1774 to force the proprietors to pay their dues to maintain civil infrastructure on the island. However, many proprietors continued to simply not pay their quitrent. In 1781, {{the government}}, led by Governor Walter Patterson, compulsorily acquired {{approximately half of the}} island using a process known as escheat. That same year, the government held a public auction to <b>sell</b> <b>off</b> the land that had been compulsorily acquired. However, following a concerted effort by the proprietors to get the Colonial Office to reverse the action, the Crown overturned the sales conducted at the auction in 1783. The proprietors requested that Governor Patterson be removed from his office, and the Colonial Office did so in 1786.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, the two cart sheds {{on either}} side of the lane leading into the farm were removed. That year, Councillor T. R. Parker {{purchased}} a plot of land on the site from King's College. Manor Farm continued as a working farm until the following year, when the local council began to <b>sell</b> <b>off</b> much of the land surrounding the buildings for housing developments. Councillor Parker presented his land to the Ruislip Village Trust as the site of a future public hall, and the Trust passed it to the urban district council in 1964 stipulating that that would be the sole use. The council obliged and the Winston Churchill Hall was built in 1965.|$|E

5|$|In late October 2009, Halcyon {{announced}} it would auction off the rights to future Terminator material and was seeking $60–70 million, though the only offer made was by director Joss Whedon for $10,000. In December 2009, Halcyon {{issued a statement saying}} that they were looking at various options including sale and refinancing of the rights with an announcement on the outcome no later than February 1, 2010. On February 8, 2010, an auction was held to determine the owner of the Terminator rights. After studios Sony Pictures and Lionsgate bid separately, Pacificor, the hedge fund that pushed Halcyon into bankruptcy, made a deal for $29.5 million. Pacificor hired an agency to <b>sell</b> <b>off</b> the rights to the franchise.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s, {{a drought}} forced Del Valle to <b>sell</b> <b>off</b> {{much of his}} land, but he {{retained}} Camulos and prospered there. By {{the time of his}} death in 1880, he had expanded the house to twenty rooms, and the compound had become a self-sustaining ranch, complete with a brick winery, chapel, barn and workers' housing. Records indicate that in 1870 the ranch was largest vintner in the area. A stagecoach line opened in 1874 and in 1887, Southern Pacific ran a rail line past the ranch, including a depot at Camulos, ending the ranch's isolation.|$|E
5|$|Orr's first {{professional}} contract {{was one of}} the first in professional ice hockey to be negotiated by an agent. It made him the highest-paid player in NHL history as a rookie. His second contract was the first million-dollar contract in the NHL. However, after his retirement, Orr learned he was deeply in debt and he had to <b>sell</b> <b>off</b> most of what he owned. Orr broke with his agent Alan Eagleson and sued the Black Hawks to settle his contract. Orr and his family returned to Boston where Orr went into business to rebuild his finances. Orr aided the investigations that led to Eagleson's fraud convictions and disbarment. Orr also supported the lawsuit that exposed the corruption of the NHL's pension plan.|$|E

5|$|The cellar of the {{building}} contained a barber's shop, a grocery store and a butcher shop. The remaining premises were used as apartments for rent. When Dimitri Orlov died in 1911 while building a railroad in the Russian Far East, his widow, left with five children, had to <b>sell</b> <b>off</b> the house to pay her family's debts. In 1983, renovation works were started on {{the building}} to convert it into a hotel. Since {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union in 1991, various reconstruction works have been largely unsuccessful. As of 2009, the Castle of Richard the Lionheart still stands empty and fenced off in renovation.|$|E
5|$|With the MDHB on {{the verge}} of {{bankruptcy}} a decision was taken to shut down and <b>sell</b> <b>off</b> the whole of the south docks system. The warehouses were emptied and in 1972 the Albert Dock finally closed down. The Brunswick Dock gates, which separated the South Docks system from the River Mersey, were opened allowing tidal movements in and the process of the clogging up the docks with sewage polluted silt began. In many senses just as the Albert Dock's development had symbolised the prosperity in the Liverpool {{at the time of its}} construction, its subsequent decline after the Second World War symbolised the collapse of the local economy as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's {{final game}} at the stadium was their FA Premier League match on 7 May 2006 against Wigan Athletic, the last game of the season. The team needed to better the result of {{neighbours}} Tottenham Hotspur to again secure qualification for the Champions League. Having been 2–1 behind, a hat trick by captain and all-time leading goal scorer Thierry Henry secured qualification, with Henry kneeling down to kiss the turf on scoring what {{proved to be the}} final goal seen at the stadium. The last goal scored in a regulation {{game at the}} stadium came in a Football Aid charity match when lifelong fan Alan Alger scored a penalty in the final minute of a fixture played on Thursday 8 June 2006 (exactly one month and one day after Henry's goal). After the stadium's closure, Arsenal held an auction to <b>sell</b> <b>off</b> many of the stadium's parts, including pieces of the pitch, the goalposts and former manager George Graham's desk. Sale of the stadium's seats had to be cancelled after it was found they contained trace amounts of the toxic metal cadmium.|$|E
