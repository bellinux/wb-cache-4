5|$|Velociraptor was warm-blooded to some degree, as it {{required}} a <b>significant</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> to hunt. Modern animals that possess feathery or furry coats, like Velociraptor did, {{tend to be}} warm-blooded, since these coverings function as insulation. However, bone growth rates in dromaeosaurids and some early birds suggest a more moderate metabolism, compared with most modern warm-blooded mammals and birds. The kiwi is similar to dromaeosaurids in anatomy, feather type, bone structure and even the narrow anatomy of the nasal passages (usually a key indicator of metabolism). The kiwi is a highly active, if specialized, flightless bird, with a stable body temperature and a fairly low resting metabolic rate, making it a good model for the metabolism of primitive birds and dromaeosaurids.|$|E

2500|$|The {{relatively}} {{low energy density}} of pumped storage systems requires either large flows and/or large differences in height between reservoirs. The only way to store a <b>significant</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> is by having {{a large body of}} water located relatively near, but as high above as possible, a second body of water.

2500|$|While {{observations}} {{have come}} in which narrow the window during which the epoch of reionization could have taken place, it is still uncertain which objects provided the photons that reionized the IGM. To ionize neutral hydrogen, an energy larger than 13.6 eV is required, which corresponds to photons with a wavelength of 91.2 nm or shorter. This is in the ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum, {{which means that the}} primary candidates are all sources which produce a <b>significant</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> in the ultraviolet and above. How numerous the source is must also be considered, as well as the longevity, as protons and electrons will recombine if energy is not continuously provided to keep them apart. Altogether, the critical parameter for any source considered can be summarized as its [...] "emission rate of hydrogen-ionizing photons per unit cosmological volume." [...] With these constraints, it is expected that quasars and first generation stars and galaxies were the main sources of energy.|$|E
