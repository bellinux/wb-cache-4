40|$|Abradable <b>seal</b> <b>rubber</b> {{has been}} widely used in aero-engine fans to improve their {{efficiency}} by reducing the clearance between rotating and stationary components. To investigate the high-speed scraping behavior between a vulcanized silicone rubber and a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V fan blade and evaluate the abradable performance of <b>seal</b> <b>rubber,</b> abrasion tests were conducted at a blade tip velocity of 50 – 300  m/s with an incursion rate of 100  μm/s. The influences of the blade tip velocity on the wear mechanism and interaction forces were specially analyzed. It is shown that abrasive wear and pattern wear are the predominant wear mechanisms, and pattern wear {{can be seen as}} the emergence and propagation of cracks. With an increase of the blade tip velocity, both of the final incursion depth and wear mass loss of <b>seal</b> <b>rubber</b> exhibit growth trends. The gradual changes of rubbing forces with an increase of rubbing time are the characteristic of abrasive wear, and force curves with unstable mutations are a reflection of pattern wear. At a constant incursion rate of 100  μm/s, the maximum values of interaction forces decrease first and then grow with an increase of the blade tip velocity, and the blade tip velocity of 150  m/s becomes the cut-off point between abrasive wear and pattern wear...|$|R

We can find complexity arising from some causes of leakage {{even in a}} simple square-ring <b>rubber</b> <b>seal.</b> The major causes are (1) large displacement around a head-gasket generated by the combustion, (2) seal distortion at a high compression, (3) <b>seal</b> <b>rubber</b> degradation induced by coolant microorganism deterioration, (4) uncontrolled seal production and (5) unsuitable rubber composition.

30|$|The proper {{assembly}} of underground precast concrete structures is often {{critical in the}} construction of underground structures. In particular, interfacial waterproofing between precast concrete segments is a key factor influencing use, safety, and life span. Current practice is to incorporate waterproofing rubber strips in the design. During the installation process, compressive stress is applied to the strip by post-tensioning to achieve performance. For this paper, lateral constraint compression tests were carried out on composite rubber seal strips that utilize putty. Special waterproofing and sealing test devices were designed to investigate corresponding relationships between water pressure and compressive stress (or strain). A relationship between water resistance pressure and compression stress and strain of the putty-based composite rubber strip was proposed based on the series tests and the control target of the minimum compression strain of the putty composite rubber strip was then suggested. Finally, full-scale waterproofing tests on tunnel joints were conducted. The experimental results provide a scientific reference for the engineering application and design of composite <b>sealing</b> <b>rubber</b> strips putty for underground post-tensioned precast concrete structures.|$|E

Before collecting water samples, all materials were well flushed with the water {{that was to be}} sampled later. Samples for the anion and cation analytics were filtered with a 0.45 -μm membrane filter. To prevent the formation of metal hydroxide complexes, samples for the major and trace elements were acidified with sub-boiled nitric acid (HNO 3) to pH[*]<[*] 2 immediately after sampling. Samples for anion analytics (SO 4, F, Cl) were darkened with aluminium foil and frozen until the day of analysis. Water samples for CFC measurements were collected from the outflow B 1 in 1 -L faceted glass bottles locked in water-filled gas-tight brass tubes. The empty glass bottle is plunged completely in a metallic tin. The water is filled in the glass bottle using a rubber tube positioned at its bottom. The sampling is carried out in a 10 -L plastic bucket. After complete overflow of the bottle and the tin and continuous flushing for at least several minutes to remove atmospheric air from the sample bottle, the tube was pulled out and the bottle was closed under water in the tin.

40|$|In the paper, the {{relaxation}} {{processes in the}} el astomeric compositions based on nitrile rubber and filed with ground vulcanizate are studied. The ground vulcanizate is obtained from waste products of molded rubber products. The particle size is 0. 63 – 1. 00 mm. The main elastic and stress-strain properties of elasomeric compositions under research are determined. The dependence of the properties on the ground vulcanizate dosage is considered. It is shown that the growth of ground vulcanizate dosage increases the viscosity of the rubber compounds. At {{the same time the}} stress relaxation rate was practically not changed. The processes of compression and tension stress relaxation in vulcanizates are studied. It is revealed that the nature of the process of physical relaxation does not change with increasing the dosage of the ground vulcanizate. There is the growth of the modulus with the increasing of the filler dosage. It is determined that the degree of stress relaxation in tensile strain is practically independent on the do sage of the filler and it has an extreme character for the compressed samples. It is shown that the use of ground vulcanizate as a filler for elastomeric compositions based on NBR can slow processes of the chemical stress relaxation in the elastomeric matrix, as well as it can improve the physical and mechanical properties of vulcanizates. The results of studies suggest that ground vulcanizate {{can be used as a}} filler for <b>sealing</b> <b>rubber...</b>|$|E

30|$|Because {{of errors}} at the {{interface}} {{of the whole}} joint, there were gaps between the maximum joint width and the minimum joints width in different places along the joint. Epoxy resin and chloroprene rubber glue were brushed in the groove, making the groove depth less than 6  mm. According to preliminary measurements, {{the depth of the}} groove was reduced by 2  mm, and the compression strain calculated by the average value was approximately 52 %. At the same time, stress of the post-tensioning steel bars was monitored using strain gauges. The maximum stress loss of the steel bars before and after fastening the bolts was taken. As the post-tensioning steel bars were tensioned and the bolts fastened to a maximum value of 40  MPa and the minimum value of 10  MPa, the difference of displacement among the steel bars was 50 – 200  μm. Water injection by pressure pump was completed after tensioning to the presetting loading levels. Every pressure level was maintained up to 10 – 15  min. To observe whether there was leaking at the joint surface (Ministry of Housing and Urban Rural Development of People’s Republic of China 2012). During this period, the water pressure value was allowed to decrease due to permeable water absorption on the concrete surface. Waterproofing was judged to fail once water droplets exuded from the joints and the surrounding concrete surface upon repressing when water pressure was reduced. The design value of water resistance pressure of this test was 0.12  MPa. During the test, the water pressure in the interface was gradually increased to 0.06, 0.08, 0.1  MPa and the design value of 0.12  MPa. Results indicated that there were no leakages at the interface of the strip denoting waterproofing ability of the <b>sealing</b> <b>rubber</b> strip in the joint interface was qualified under the designed water resistance pressure of 0.12  MPa.|$|E
