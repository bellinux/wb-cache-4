Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would {{spend much of their}} time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools. In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.|$|E

40|$|This PhD project aims to {{demonstrate}} the importance of giving space to local student voices as forms of subjugated knowledges to inform the curriculum on Family and Child Care. It does so by reflecting upon the process and product of critical autobiographical assignments which social work students at the University of the Western Cape, an historically black university in South Africa, undertake on <b>their</b> own <b>families.</b> In so doing it provides on-the-ground information about students' family circumstances. Social work is purportedly a profession that challenges inequalities and social exclusion. It therefore seems pertinent to examine the issues of privilege, inequality and subjugation in relation to issues of the social work curriculum. The family stories which students wrote in their assignments are analysed {{in terms of how}} privileges and disadvantages in relation to race, gender and age have affected students' and family members' ability to flourish as human beings. The students' stories of cultural racism which they <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members were exposed are analysed as an instance of misrecognition, and stories of institutional racism are analysed from a human capabilities perspective. The responses to these forms of racism by <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members are also reported on. Furthermore, gender and generation are examined in terms of the responsibilities that <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members undertook to care for each other. Responsibilities include cooking, cleaning, care-giving in relation to dependents, and acquiring resources for family members through paid employment. Students stories revealed that the way in which <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members were recognised or misrecognised, and the access they had to resources depended on <b>their</b> gender <b>and</b> generational positioning in the household. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the insights which emerge from these accounts of privilege and disadvantage in order to renew the social work curriculum. Important areas for consideration in the curriculum which emerge from the analysis of students' stories include questioning the assumed usefulness of systems theories for social work, the inclusion of the concept of (mis) recognition, the human capabilities approach, the political ethics of care, participatory action research, <b>and</b> including <b>students</b> as co-constructors rather than consumers of the curriculu...|$|R
25|$|Dirk took a great {{interest}} in the personal welfare of his <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> and was meticulous in making sure they received adequate support; indeed, he encouraged Leggett to apply for a Prize Fellowship at Magdalen, which he held from 1963 to 1967. In the end Leggett's thesis consisted of studies of two somewhat disconnected problems in the general area of liquid helium, one on higher-order phonon interaction processes in superfluid 4He and the other on the properties of dilute solutions of 4He in normal liquid 3He (a system which unfortunately turned out to be much less experimentally accessible than {{the other side of the}} phase diagram, dilute solutions of 3He in 4He).

25|$|From {{the late}} 1920s through the mid-1930s, the Holy Cross Fathers, {{who run the}} University of Notre Dame, {{controlled}} the college's administration.

During World War II, St. Thomas served as a training base for naval officers, which kept the school open when men who would have attended college were fighting in the war. After the war, in 1948, the college established 'Tom Town' on the eastern end of the lower quadrant, which is currently home to the O'Shaughnessey-Frey Library.
