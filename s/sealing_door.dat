40|$|Vid tillverkning av den kulglass som säljs i glassbarer och på restauranger används en hårdglassmaskin. Glassmaskinen kyler och blandar glassmassan till rätt temperatur och konsistens innan glassen kan serveras. Oceanpower är ett kinesiskt företag som bland annat utvecklar och tillverkar glassmaskiner. Ett nytt konstruktionsförslag har tagits fram för dörren som försluter kylcylindern på deras hårdglassmaskin OPH 42. Genom studiebesök och egna {{analyser}} har förbättringsmöjligheter kunnat lokaliseras hos den befintliga förslutningsdörren. Dessa har främst varit kopplade till hygienen och den dagliga rengörningen av maskinen. En mängd olika koncept för en ny konstruktion av dörren togs fram och utvärderades mot en kravspecifikation. Konceptet som valdes som det mest passande byggde på att ett munstycke monteras på förslutningsdörren med hjälp av en bajonettlåsning vilket kan lossas varje gång glassmaskinen skall rengöras. Således kan det gallerförsedda munstycket diskas för hand eller i maskin istället för att gallret rengörs på plats på maskinen. Förslutningsdörren som tidigare var fäst på maskinfronten med en fast led på ena sidan konstruerades om så att rotationsleden kunde glida i ett spår. Detta gör att dörren kan tryckas på plats rakt framifrån och på så sätt minska belastningen på den gummipackning som tätar förslutningsdörren. Dörren spänns åt med två handtag på var sida för att sprida trycket på packningen. When the gelato sold in {{ice cream}} {{bars and restaurants}} is manufactured, an ice cream machine is used. The ice cream machine cools and mixes the ice cream to the right temperature and consistency {{before it can be}} served. Oceanpower is a Chinese company that, among other things, develops and manufactures ice cream machines. A new design proposal to the door that seals the cooling cylinder on their ice cream machine OPH 42 has been developed. Through interviews, visits and analysis of the ice cream machine has opportunities for improvement been localized in the existing <b>sealing</b> <b>door.</b> These have mainly been linked to hygiene and the daily cleaning of the machine. A variety of concepts for a new design of the door was developed and evaluated against a set of requirements. The concept that was chosen as the most fitting was based on a nozzle mounted on the <b>sealing</b> <b>door</b> with a bayonet lock which can be released each time the ice cream machine should be cleaned. Accordingly, the nozzle can be washed by hand or machine instead of that the grill must be cleaned in place on the machine. The <b>sealing</b> <b>door</b> which was previously attached to the machine front with a fixed point on one side was reconstructed so that the rotation point could slip in a groove. This means that the door can be pushed into place from the front, thus reducing the load on the rubber gasket that seals the door. The door is clamped by two handles on each side to spread the pressure on the gasket...|$|E
