5000|$|In the 1960s, Shera {{designed}} {{a proposal for}} his project of [...] "Social Epistemology", building {{on the work of}} Douglas Waples of the Graduate Library School at Chicago. Waples dealt with social effects of reading, and asked the basic questions of the new discipline that Shera named social epistemology. This new discipline is a study {{of the ways in which}} society can access and perceive its environment or information. It can also provide a framework for the production, flow, integration, and consumption of information throughout society. One of the most practical applications of social epistemology is in the library profession. A librarian aims to be an efficient mediator between man and his access to recorded knowledge. Tools to achieve this goal are classification schemes, <b>subject</b> <b>headings,</b> <b>indexes,</b> and other devices for the subject analysis of bibliographic units.|$|R

40|$|Background: Performing {{exercise}} in thermally stressful environments impairs exercise capacity and performance. Cooling during exercise {{has the potential}} to attenuate detrimental increases in body temperature and improve exercise capacity and performance. Objective: The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of practical cooling strategies applied during continuous {{exercise in}} hot environments on body temperature, heart rate, whole body sweat production, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), thermal perception and exercise performance. Methods: Electronic database searches of MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, Scopus and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) were conducted using medical <b>subject</b> <b>headings,</b> <b>indexing</b> terms and keywords. Studies were eligible if participants were defined as ‘healthy’, the exercise task was conducted in an environment ≥ 25 °C, it used a cooling strategy that would be practical for athletes to use during competition, cooling was applied during a self-paced or fixed-intensity trial, participants exercised continuously, and the study was a randomised controlled trial with the comparator either a thermoneutral equivalent or no cooling. Data for experimental and comparator groups were meta-analysed and expressed as a standardised mean difference and 95 % confidence interval. Results: Fourteen studies including 135 participants met the eligibility criteria. Confidence intervals for meta-analysed data included beneficial and detrimental effects for cooling during exercise on core temperature, mean skin temperature, heart rate and sweat production during fixed-intensity exercise. Cooling benefited RPE and thermal perception during fixed-intensity exercise and improved self-paced exercise performance. Conclusion: Cooling during fixed-intensity exercise, particularly before a self-paced exercise trial, improves endurance performance in hot environments by benefiting RPE and thermal perception, but does not appear to attenuate increases in body temperature...|$|R

The objective {{of this paper is}} to propose a framework for comparing phenotype annotations of orthologous genes based on the Medical <b>Subject</b> <b>Headings</b> (MeSH) <b>indexing</b> of biomedical articles in which these genes are discussed.

For the citation side, all existing methods, including Medical Text Indexer (MTI) by National Library of Medicine and the state-of-the-art method, MeSHLabeler, deal with text by bag-of-words, which cannot capture semantic and context-dependent information well. Methods: We propose DeepMeSH that incorporates deep semantic information for large-scale MeSH indexing. It addresses the two challenges in both citation and MeSH sides. The citation side challenge is solved by a new deep semantic representation, D 2 V-TFIDF, which concatenates both sparse and dense semantic representations. The MeSH side challenge is solved by using the 'learning to rank' framework of MeSHLabeler, which integrates various types of evidence generated from the new semantic representation.

40|$|The study {{responds}} to the new paradigms of knowledge organization in the 21 st century, trying to assess whether the current Czech terminology is still corresponding to it. We analyze and review Czech equivalents to the terms: knowledge organization, subject access, classification, <b>subject</b> <b>headings,</b> and <b>indexing</b> language (<b>subject,</b> systematic). The respective terms {{were introduced to the}} Czech terminology primarily due to Blahoslav Kovář during the 1970 s. Early in 2000 s they have been incorporated into the Czech terminology database of library and information science (TDKIV). Our analysis is based on the study of the theoretical literature focused at conceptual and terminological principles of the field. The methodology is based on modeling; we provide a comparison of Kovář's process model with our own proposal of an updated model of knowledge organization, adapted to the changed paradigm. Kovář's model sees knowledge organization as a sub-process of input and output processing phase within the framework of linear communication in the information system. The proposed updated model presents an extended concept of knowledge organization as a process carried on during several stages of the information lifecycle, in the information system and beyond, within the context of non-linear network environment...|$|R

40|$|Carterette, Benjamin A. Medical {{professionals}} leverage {{health-related data}} to address questions and support decision-makings. However, {{many of these}} medical tasks require intensive manual effort in identifying useful information in the noisy data. The rapid growth of data is making these tasks more and more costly and time-consuming. In this thesis, we develop effective medical information retrieval (IR) systems to reduce search-related manual work for three representative medical related tasks, namely electronic medical records (EMR) based cohort identification, Medical <b>Subject</b> <b>Headings</b> (MeSH) <b>indexing,</b> and gene ontology annotation (GOA). For cohort identification, we improve the search precision and recall from three aspects: 1) we design a multi-level evidence aggregation strategy for effective merging and scoring of the distributed evidence in EMR; 2) we develop a novel statistical IR model that significantly alleviates two medical language related issues in medical IR; 3) we further enhance the search performance by effectively incorporating domain knowledge into our system. For MeSH indexing and GOA, we demonstrate how to use IR to address specific needs. In particular, we investigate different query formulation methods and explore various ways in which IR work together with other techniques such as Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

The search was limited to humans and papers in the English language. Relevant guidelines were also searched using the same criteria in the National Guidelines Clearinghouse, the National Electronic Library for Health, the Organising Medical Networked Information (OMNI) and the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) Infobase. The literature search, study selection and data extraction were carried out by two authors (SU and DM) independently, and a third author (JC) made the final decision in case of disagreement.
