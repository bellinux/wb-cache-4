25|$|Clemens {{signed a}} four-year, $40 million {{deal with the}} Toronto Blue Jays after the 1996 season. In his first start in Fenway Park {{as a member of}} the Blue Jays, he pitched eight innings {{allowing}} only 4 hits and 1 earned run. 16 of his 24 outs were strikeouts, and every batter who faced him struck out at least once. As he left the field following his last inning of work, he <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> angrily towards the owner's box.|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, he famously officiated {{over the}} first all LBW hat trick in cricket, taken by Horace Fisher, the Yorkshire slow left-armer against Somerset CCC at Bramall Lane in 1932. After giving Mitchell-Innes and Andrews out lbw, he <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> the wicket at batsman Luckes when the third appeal was made, and finally-almost in disbelief-announced, [...] "As God's my witness, that's out, too." [...] and lifted his finger. [...] "I was never more sure that I was right in each case," [...] he said afterwards, {{and each of the}} batsmen agreed that he had been trapped dead in front.|$|E
2500|$|He {{is notable}} {{as the first}} bowler to ever claim a hat trick of LBW victims, {{in the course of}} taking 5 for 12 against Somerset at Sheffield in August 1932. Umpire Alex Skelding, after {{dispatching}} Mandy Mitchell-Innes for five and then Bill Andrews first ball in the same manner, <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> the wicket at the new man Wally Luckes, when the third appeal was made. After a pregnant pause, he stated, [...] "As God's my witness, that's out, too". In the same match, Fisher posted his highest ever first-class score in Yorkshire's only innings, an unbeaten 76, as Yorkshire ran out winners by an innings and 93. Earlier that week Fisher took six wickets for 11 runs, against Leicestershire at Bradford, which remained his best bowling return.|$|E
60|$|The lineman, a young fellow, {{paused in}} the {{cracking}} of a hard-boiled egg to <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> at the couple.|$|R
60|$|He {{wanted to}} get right away from London and {{everybody}} and lie in the quiet darkness and <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> at the stars.|$|R
25|$|That night, Walt {{is unable}} to fall asleep, and this time, a fly lands on the smoke detector's {{flashing}} light as Walt <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> at it.|$|R
60|$|Dawes <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at {{the picture}} with a caustic {{expression}} on his face.|$|E
60|$|Ferris <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at him, and {{his face}} showed almost livid through the {{luminous}} night.|$|E
60|$|So {{they rolled}} me over on my back, where I <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> into Warden Atherton's face.|$|E
60|$|He would {{sneak out}} on moonless winter nights and <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> at the stars, and {{afterwards}} {{find it difficult}} to tell his father where he had been.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What! Don't {{you love}} him?' said Jocelyn, with a {{surprised}} <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> {{at her as}} she stood, in her concern appearing the very Avice who had kissed him twenty years earlier.|$|R
40|$|A {{young boy}} wearing a patron saint medal <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> at {{a figure of}} Christ crucified on a cross. The {{following}} information is printed {{on the back of}} the postcard: “Proprieta dell ’Istituto Saveriano. Missioni Estere – Parma. Foto Frassineti S. X. Giuntoli – Milan. ” There is no handwriting on the back...|$|R
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at the window-sill {{overhead}} and measured {{the size of}} the room with his eye.|$|E
60|$|Gratian <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at her. She had {{a longing}} for George--to know what he thought and felt.|$|E
60|$|The silent, {{hard-faced}} Hans leant {{forward and}} <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> the darkling water, his hand behind his ear.|$|E
50|$|An unnamed {{woman and}} her {{guardian}} are standing {{on the surface of}} a Pattern Juggler planet which is being evacuated. The woman agrees with her guardian to spend one more hour before returning to their ship. She <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> towards the stars and has the machinery in her clothing magnify one of them, revealing it to be colored green.|$|R
6000|$|... [Loud and {{continued}} applause, amidst which THE CALIFORNIAN turns {{from the man}} in the berth before him, and restores order by marching along the aisle of the car in his stocking feet. The heads vanish behind the curtains. As the laughter subsides, he returns to his berth, and after a <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> and down the tranquillized car, he is about to retire.] ...|$|R
60|$|A {{horror of}} the spirit came over me, and, as if rapt away from myself, I <b>stared</b> sheer <b>up</b> at him.|$|R
60|$|They {{stopped and}} stood in a row, and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at the kittens. They had very small eyes and looked surprised.|$|E
60|$|At that {{he laughed}} in good earnest, and slapped his breech-clouts repeatedly. All {{at once he}} stopped, and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> the ridge.|$|E
60|$|He {{pushed his}} chair back and, rising slowly from the table, confronted him. Captain Brisket, red-faced and confident, <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at him composedly.|$|E
6000|$|... [BURLACOMBE {{touches his}} forelock and goes. MRS. BRADMERE stands [...] quite still, thinking. Then {{going to the}} photograph, she <b>stares</b> [...] <b>up</b> at it.] ...|$|R
60|$|It is no use. I {{shall never}} be able to sleep in a bed again. I have tried it now, {{numerous}} times, and every such night is a horror. If I could but only persuade him to go to bed! But no. He sits there, and sits there--I know he does--while I <b>stare</b> and <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> into the blackness and think and think, continually think, of him sitting there. I wish I had never heard of the eternity of forms.|$|R
60|$|Kirk {{put an arm}} round him. Bill <b>stared</b> gravely <b>up</b> {{into his}} face. There was a silence. From outside came a sudden {{rumbling}} crash. Bill jumped.|$|R
60|$|The {{searcher}} {{placed the}} photo {{in the pool}} of light. The tiny face of a girl <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at them, unmoved, from its short hair.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Stringham <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at him, {{surprised}} at this picture. But she had plainly {{an idea that}} after an instant resisted it. [...] "That was his professional propriety." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lionel <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at him. [...] "O God!" [...] {{he cried}} presently, [...] "I know not what to believe. I am a shuttle-cock flung {{this way and}} that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can see that, fool." [...] A bulky body {{interposed}} between Peter Blood and the window. The half-naked man on {{the straw}} rolled his black eyes to <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> fearfully out of a clay-coloured face at this intruder. A knowledge of English was unnecessary to inform him that here came an enemy. The harsh, minatory note of that voice sufficiently expressed the fact. [...] "I can see that, fool; just as I can see what the rascal is. Who gave you leave to set Spanish legs?" ...|$|R
50|$|Next, Arthur “rescues” Eliza from boredom {{by placing}} her with Mrs. Fielding. This accomplished, Arthur can finally {{concentrate}} on his apprenticeship, {{but he quickly}} realizes {{that he is in}} love with Mrs. Fielding. This comes as such a shock to him that he actually goes out to the house in the country where Mrs. Fielding is staying and <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> at her window at night. She is frightened, recognizes him, and tells him to see her in the city. The next day they finally admit their feelings to each other and agree to marry.|$|R
60|$|Someone {{has told}} them--I think I first started {{the idea in}} my pamphlet--that the thing is to sleep {{on a pile of}} hemlock branches. I think I told them to listen to the wind sowing (you know the word I mean), sowing and crooning in the giant pines. So there they are upside-down, doubled up on a couch of green spikes that would have killed St. Sebastian. They <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> at the sky with blood-shot, restless eyes, waiting for the crooning to begin. And there isn't a sow in sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "C-consent to this marriage, c-consent to this marriage." [...] There was yet {{room for}} Isaac Worthington to be amazed, {{and for a}} while he <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at Jethro, speechless.|$|E
60|$|He lay on {{his back}} and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at me, and his eyes had a glassy stare. Then he roused himself by an effort, and raised himself upon his elbow.|$|E
60|$|Derek {{had come}} closer; {{he put his}} hand down and gripped her arm. Her eloquence dried up before the intentness of his face, and she just <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "The man who {{had just}} entered the shop was a short, slight, hunched, beetle-browed man, with long arms and very short bandy legs. Apparently I had {{interrupted}} a meal. He stared about the shop {{with an expression of}} expectation. This gave way to surprise, and then to anger, as he saw the shop empty. 'Damn the boys!' he said. He went to <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> and down the street. He came in again in a minute, kicked the door to with his foot spitefully, and went muttering back to the house door.|$|R
2500|$|... "'Don't Tell Me' was {{the most}} {{unlikely}} follow-up to 2000's 'Music'. Stop-and-go guitar riffs, an atypical structure and peculiar lyrics ('Tell the bed not to lay/Like the open mouth of a grave/Not to <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> at me/Like a calf down on its knees') made it an unlikely hit to boot. But a hit is exactly what it was, earning Madonna her 27th Top 5 hit and 24th gold single (tying the Beatles). [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] found Madonna at her most soulful, with a vocal performance reminiscent of the forceful tone of [...] "Express Yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{a certain}} grimly genteel street they paused to <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> at {{a row of}} grimly respectable houses; for, though the name wasn't {{on any of the}} doors, they were sure Mr. Dombey still lived there. A rough dog lay on one of the doorsteps, and a curtain fluttered at an open upper window. Poor Di was {{growling}} in his sleep, and above there little Paul was watching for the golden water on the wall, while faithful Florence sung to him, and Susan Nipper put away derisive sniffs and winks in closets and behind doors for the benefit of 'them Pipchinses.' ...|$|R
