5|$|His first {{squadron}} was No. 29 Squadron RAF, {{based at}} RAF West Malling, flying the two-seater Hawker Demon. In February 1939 No 29 Squadron re-equipped with the Bristol Blenheim. Braham was disappointed at not being {{trained on the}} Hawker Hurricane and his reaction to this news was request a transfer which was refused. The squadron spent three months converting onto the Blenheim. In August 1939 No. 29 did convert to the Hurricane but upon the outbreak of war the squadron was reverted to the Blenheim {{as part of its}} reorientation to night fighter rather than daylight fighter operations. Braham soon earned the nickname 'Bob', which <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> throughout his service career. He had chosen this Christian name as his radio call sign to distinguish himself from the multitude of other Johns in the unit.|$|E
5|$|In {{later life}} Lilly {{obtained}} a large atlas and marked {{the path of}} his movements in {{the war and the}} location of battles and skirmishes. He often used the atlas when telling war stories. His colonel's title <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{for the rest of his}} life, and his friends and family used it as a nickname for him. Lilly served as chairman of the Grand Army of the Republic, a brotherhood of Union Civil War veterans, in 1893. During his term he helped organize an event that brought tens of thousands of Union war veterans, including Lilly's battery, together in Indianapolis for a reunion and a large parade.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{was born}} Selina Catherine Eaton to mother Catherine Calvert Eaton and Gordon Dunn Eaton. In her childhood, {{she loved her}} father (whom she affectionately called Daddy), but resented her narcissistic mother. It is later {{revealed}} that Selina's father was an adulterer who died {{from a heart attack}} while having sex with his secretary, and that her mother only <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> to provide for her. Selina attended Smith College, and Yale Law School. As a young woman, she married Andrew Meyer, a shady real estate developer, with whom she has a daughter, Catherine. She eventually divorces Andrew for repeatedly cheating on her, and shows little (if any) maternal instinct towards her daughter.|$|E

5|$|In the Matsya Purana, Ila was disinherited after {{becoming}} a female or kimpurusha. Ila's father passed his inheritance directly to Pururavas, ignoring the three sons Ila-Sudyumma bore as a male. Pururavas ruled from Pratishtanapura (present-day Allahabad), where Ila <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> The Ramayana says that having returned to manhood, Ila ruled Pratishtana while his son Shashabindu ruled over Bahlika. The Devi-Bhagavata Purana tells {{that as a}} man Sudyumma governed the kingdom and as a woman remained indoors. His subjects were disturbed by his sex changes and did not respect him as they once had. When Pururavas attained adulthood, Sudyumma left his kingdom to Pururavas {{and went to the}} forest for penance. The sage Narada told Sudyumma a nine-syllable mantra, Navakshara, which would please the Supreme Goddess. Pleased with his austerities, the Goddess emerged before Sudyumma, who was in his female form Ilā. Sudyumma praised the Goddess, who merged the king's soul with herself and thus, Ilā gained salvation.|$|E
5|$|Tapp {{is forced}} to move further into the asylum, where he is {{captured}} by Pighead and {{is placed in the}} Shotgun Collar, which is later used in Saw III. Still in the trap, Tapp finds a second victim who is being held by Jigsaw. The victim, Jennings Foster, blames Tapp for being in his trap and thus harbors hatred for him. Tapp finds Jennings in a Pendulum Trap similar to the one used in Saw V. Tapp releases Jennings, who quickly runs away, believing that Tapp would get him killed if he <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Tapp moves on to find the next victim left behind by Jigsaw. He traverses the asylum and is led to the grave of his former partner Detective Steven Sing. It is there that Tapp discovers that Jigsaw has captured Melissa Sing, Detective Sing's widow. She has become a neglectful parent and is convinced that it is Tapp's fault that her husband was killed. Melissa is found in an Iron Maiden-esque Trap with spinning blades that will mangle her body should the device close on her. Jigsaw informs her that Tapp did not call for backup when searching Jigsaw's lair and that every one of the traps there could have been easily avoided by using standard police procedure, which makes Tapp responsible for his partner's death. Tapp saves Melissa. She says Jigsaw gave her the option to leave Tapp, so she quickly runs away.|$|E

25|$|Following {{from this}} kind of thought Munch thus {{considered}} a territorial defence of Denmark impossible, and illusions about this downright dangerous.

These ideas <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> throughout his political career, and he would manage to stamp them quite firmly on Danish Foreign Policy.|$|E

Because of this discrimination, Albert Einstein, a champion of racial tolerance, hosted Anderson on many occasions, the first being in 1937 when she was denied a hotel before performing at Princeton University. She last <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> months before he died in 1955.|$|E

He was committed to find and paint all the birds of North America for eventual publication. His goal was to surpass the earlier ornithological work of poet-naturalist Alexander Wilson.

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} it was not {{sufficient}} for the husband simply to say to his wife (in the presence of two witnesses) not to converse with a man. And if she nonetheless conversed with him, she was still permitted to her husband and (if a daughter of a Kohen) still permitted to eat from sacrifices. If, however, she entered a private place with the man and <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> long enough to have committed misconduct, she was forbidden to her husband and forbidden to eat from sacrifices, and if her husband died, she was required to perform the ceremony of halizah and could not contract a levirate marriage.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his career, Howerd hid his {{potentially}} career-destroying homosexuality (acts between consenting males being {{illegal in}} England and Wales until 1967) from both his audience and his mother, Edith.
