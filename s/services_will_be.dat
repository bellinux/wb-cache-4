5|$|Network Rail, in its July 2011 London & South East route {{utilisation}} strategy, {{recommended that}} all services from Herne Hill towards Blackfriars should terminate {{in the bay}} platforms at Blackfriars after London Bridge's redevelopment is completed in 2018 and the diverted Thameslink trains return there. Passengers from Herne Hill would then have had to change at Blackfriars to travel further north. Network Rail made this recommendation because more <b>services</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> using the route between St Pancras and London Bridge from 2018; sending trains from Herne Hill to the terminating platforms {{on the western side}} of Blackfriars (instead of the through tracks on {{the eastern side of the}} station) would have removed the need for them to cross in front of trains to/from Denmark Hill and trains to/from London Bridge at junctions south of Blackfriars.|$|E

25|$|Lima Memorial Health System, {{formerly}} Lima Memorial Hospital, a level 2 trauma center, {{can trace}} its roots to 1899, {{when it began}} as Lima City Hospital. Formed by the Pastors Union of Lima, the 13-bed facility was the first community hospital in northwest Ohio. During the Great Depression, the city of Lima helped to finance a larger hospital, which opened on Memorial Day 1933 on the city's east side. The region's first open-heart surgery was performed at Lima Memorial on April 22, 1997. In 1999 LMHS entered into a Joint venture with Blanchard Valley Health Association ("BVHA") and ProMedica Health System. Lima Memorial Health System is currently undergoing an extensive remodel phase. The eight story patient tower is being converted to all private rooms, and all cardiac <b>services</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> combined to one area. A new surgery center is under construction at this time, and the installation a level 2 neonatal ICU is in the works.|$|E
500|$|Rising {{standards}} of achievement at Dartington enabled Imogen to organise performances of more demanding works, such as Bach's Mass in B minor in July 1950 to honour the 200th anniversary of Bach's death. Three years in preparation, this endeavour brought a tribute {{from one of}} the audience: [...] "I don't know, and can't imagine what the music of heaven is like. But when we all get there, please God, if any conducting is still necessary I hope your <b>services</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> required and that I will be in the chorus". By the middle of 1950 Imogen's professional focus was changing. She had attended the first two Aldeburgh Festivals in 1948 and [...] 1949, and in 1950 accepted a commission [...] to provide a choral work for performance at the 1951 festival. Sensing {{that it was time to}} leave Dartington, she gave a year's notice, part of which was spent on sabbatical, studying Indian music at Rabindranath Tagore's university in West Bengal. A fruit of this visit was her Ten Indian Folk Tunes for recorder. On 21 July 1951 her one-act opera, Benedick and Beatrice, was performed at Dartington, to mark her departure.|$|E

500|$|A core {{feature of}} Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. The game can track any Uruk (A [...] "nastier orc," [...] the general antagonists of the game) that the player comes into contact with. While there are [...] "generic" [...] Uruk for the player to fight en masse, {{and will be}} as cannon fodder as part of Sauron's armies, the game will begin {{tracking}} Uruk that perform any notable talents within the game, such as killing the player, or surviving an encounter with the player. These Uruk will be promoted into captains. Defeating these leaders will help to weaken Sauron's army, and these leaders will drop a rune which the player can install on Talion's weapons to provide additional buffs in battle. Alternatively, being killed by a leader will cause the current mission to be cancelled and the player returned to a safe point to continue exploring, and the leader will gain additional power, making him more difficult to defeat in the next encounter. If the procedurally generated Orcs survive an encounter with Talion, they will also be promoted. Further, such deaths are tracked through online servers, and the player's friends on the various network <b>services</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> notified of this death and be offered the chance to accept a Vendetta mission, and exact revenge on the Uruk. If the mission is successful the game will give rewards to both the original player and the victorious friend.|$|E
