40|$|The {{label-free}} amperometric {{detection of}} a rabbit IgG antigen by an anti-rabbit IgG antibody {{is achieved by}} observing the electrochemistry at a glassy carbon electrode modified with antibody entrapped in an electrodeposited polypyrrole membrane. In a flow injection apparatus the electrode is pulsed between - 0. 2 and + 0. 4 V versus Ag/AgCl. The pulsing of the electrode switches the polypyrrole membrane between the oxidised and reduced states. When antigen is injected into the flow stream a change in current is observed at the electrode despite the antigen or antibody being redox inactive at the potentials employed. It is proposed that this current {{is due to a}} change in the flux of ions {{into and out of the}} polypyrrole matrix during a pulse when the poly-anionic antigen is present. The immunoreaction was reversible because the 200 ms pulse at each potential was too short to allow <b>secondary</b> <b>bonding</b> <b>forces</b> (hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic forces) which are responsible for the strength of the antibody-antigen complex to be established. The consequence of the reversibility of the antigen-antibody binding is a low apparent affinity constant but an easily regenerated recognition interface. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

The films were characterized during sorption and desorption experiments using near-infrared, fluorescence, gravimetric measurements, {{differential scanning calorimetry}} and dynamic mechanical analysis. There were three water molecules per repeat unit in DGEB-DDM and four water molecules per repeat unit in DGEB-DDS films containing a saturated water content. Fluorescence provided evidence that water hydrogen bonds to the sulfone group and interacts with the tertiary nitrogen groups. These interactions accounted for two-thirds {{of the water in}} DGEB-DDM and three-fourths of the water DGEB-DDS. The remaining water hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl and ether groups. No more than one out of every four-hydroxyl groups per repeat unit in either film formed a secondary cross-link to the tertiary nitrogen, sulfone or ether group based on shifts in the NIR peaks of the free and hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups in films heated above the Tg. The isolated NIR spectrum for water was deconvoluted to identify three spectroscopically distinct species in which zero, {{one or two of the}} hydrogen atoms were hydrogen bonded. The three species designated S 0, S 1 and S 2 were present in a ratio of approximately 3 : 9 : 5 respectively in both saturated polymers. Results were combined to develop a two-dimensional static model of the molecular interactions. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and DMA properties were measured simultaneously to model property changes as a function of the bound water content. Two glass transition temperatures were identified in samples containing a heterogeneous concentration of water, while a single Tg was identified in samples containing a homogeneous concentration of water. Water within the epoxy networks formed more hydrogen bonds with the polymer network than the number of secondary cross-links that were broken. A mathematical model was derived and tested based on the relative mole fraction of the three distinct species of water to predict the Tg of the wet polymer. The mathematical model has the potential to be applied to any polymer that undergoes changes in <b>secondary</b> <b>bonding</b> <b>forces,</b> if no covalent bonds are broken. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{presence}} of silicate layers {{may be expected}} to decrease the water uptake due to a more tortuous path for the diffusing molecules that must bypass impenetrable platelets. The improved barrier characteristics, chemical resistance, reduced solvent uptake, and flame retardance of clay–polymer nanocomposites take advantage from the hindered diffusion pathways through the nanocomposite. The water uptake of composite materials measured under the saturation conditions (168 h) are shown in Table 1. The results showed maximum water absorption for the neat polyamide film 16.1 % due to exposure of amide and sulfonyl polar groups to the surface of polymer where water molecules developed <b>secondary</b> <b>bond</b> <b>forces</b> with these polar groups. The increase in weight of the hybrid films due to uptake of water gradually decreased as the organoclay content in nanocomposites increased. This decrease is apparently due to the mutual interaction between the organic and inorganic phases. This interaction resulted in lesser availability of amide and sulfonyl groups to interact with water.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of {{composite materials}} in the aerospace industry has driven {{a need for a}} greater understanding of bonded composite joints. There are generally two types of composite joint used in the aerospace industry; <b>secondary</b> <b>bonded</b> joints and cocured joints. <b>Secondary</b> <b>bonded</b> joints are produced by bonding two cured composite laminates together with an adhesive. However, when composites and adhesives are used to manufacture large parts in the aerospace industry, it is often convenient to co-cure the two materials at the same time. This helps to reduce the high costs associated with autoclave curing and also to reduce processing time. However, despite the apparent advantages, co-curing is not without its drawbacks. Any moisture stored in the composite material prior to co-curing is released during the cure cycle and has a negative effect on the joint. This can also result in interfacial failure. A way around this problem is to either dry the composite material prior to curing or to engineer the composite surface using a variety of surface treatments to promote adhesion, such as an atmospheric pressure plasma treatment [1]. The former option will be investigated in this work. The effects of moisture on the fracture performance of <b>secondary</b> <b>bonded</b> composite joints is well publicised. Moisture can be introduced into the composite laminate prior to [2] or after [3] <b>secondary</b> <b>bonding.</b> The moisture can plasticize the adhesive and reduce the glass transition temperature of the adhesive [4]. However, compared to <b>secondary</b> <b>bonded</b> joints, relatively little work has been carried out on co-cured joints.

40|$|The intermolecular <b>bond</b> <b>force</b> {{existing}} between adhesive membrane receptors and {{extracellular matrix}} (ECM) molecules {{is believed to}} regulate key cell functions, such as growth, apoptosis, motility, and mechanotransduction. From a clinical perspective, understanding the mechanics of cell-matrix bonds may be key to unraveling the factors, which promote or inhibit wound healing as well understanding the mechanisms by which cancer cells grow and metastasize. Models describing molecular bond behavior have been studied for close to a century, but accumulation of knowledge in this area has accelerated in recent years due to the advent of methods, such as atomic force microscopy, to study biological forces in the piconewton range. Based {{on the work of}} Evans and others, the concept has emerged that molecular pairs do not possess characteristic bond strength, but rather that bond strength varies {{as a function of the}} rate at which a disrupting force is applied. On a theoretical basis, this effect may be explained by the complexity of the energy landscape typical of most biological bonds. Thus, bonds subjected to a lower rate of force loading exhibit weaker <b>bond</b> <b>force,</b> owing to the added contribution of thermal activation energy, while bonds subjected to a higher rate of force loading exhibit higher <b>bond</b> <b>force.</b> What is not generally considered is the way in which membrane compliance in cells may contribute to perceived force loading, and in turn, <b>bond</b> <b>force.</b> Our laboratory has previously determined a relationship between membrane compliance and <b>bond</b> <b>force</b> employing high-resolution force spectroscopy, whereby the more deformable domains of the cell membrane are associated with lower <b>bond</b> <b>force</b> and the less deformable domains(cont.) are associated with higher <b>bond</b> <b>force.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to analyze this distinction in light of Evans' theory of bond energetics, and to develop a model accounting for the contribution of membrane mechanics to single <b>bond</b> <b>force.</b> by Brendan T.

Dynamic force spectroscopy is simulated between two cells of varying micromechanical properties adhered by a single bond with a constant kinetic off-rate.
