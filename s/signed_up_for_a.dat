5|$|While {{training}} as a teacher, O'Reilly joined the Sydney University Regiment, {{a unit of the}} Militia Forces (Army Reserve). He did not enjoy his time in the military, and along with most of his peers, regarded the commanding officer as inept. O'Reilly was a non-conformist who did not enjoy taking orders, and was unimpressed with the firearm drills, because the recruits were armed only with wooden sticks. However, he <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second year to raise money for his education. Fed up with military routines he considered to be pointless, O'Reilly volunteered to be a kitchen hand.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin got the {{inspiration}} {{to write his}} next play, a courtroom drama called A Few Good Men, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah (who had graduated from Boston University Law School and <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps). Deborah told Sorkin {{that she was going}} to Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few Good Men.|$|E

Lists of subscribers {{were included in the}} books as endorsements. If enough people subscribed, there might be a reprint.

In 1984, he made his final performance for the WGYT and <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> course in Theatre Studies at Cardiff University after graduating from Oxford. He worked sporadically for the Sherman Theatre's publicity department and claimed unemployment benefit in the interim.

[...] He had <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pilot for CBS called Late Bloomers before agreeing to appear on Enterprise. One of the reasons he agreed to join the cast of Enterprise was that he had previously worked with Kerry McCluggage, one of the co-founders of UPN, on Quantum Leap.

500|$|After Stafford left {{to become}} a {{humanitarian}} worker, over two hundred applicants <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> nationwide search to be her replacement. Griffin eventually narrowed the list to three finalists, which consisted of Summer Bartholomew, former Playboy centerfold Vicki McCarty, and Vanna White. Griffin gave {{each of the three}} women an opportunity to win the job by putting them in a rotation for several weeks after Stafford's departure. In December 1982, Griffin named White as Stafford's successor, saying that he felt she was capable of activating the puzzle board letters (which is the primary role of the Wheel hostess) better than anyone else who had auditioned. White became highly popular among the young female demographic, and also gained a fanbase of adults interested in her daily wardrobe, in a phenomenon that has been referred to as [...] "Vannamania".
