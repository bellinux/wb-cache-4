40|$|The Obama Administration 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Clean Power Plan 2 ̆ 2 for {{addressing}} industrial carbon emissions is controversial {{as a matter}} of environmental policy. It also has important constitutional implications. The rule was initially crafted not by officers or employees of the Environmental Protection Agency, but by two private lawyers and a scientist with industry ties. Private parties operate extra-constitutionally, and no existing legal doctrine tethers constitutional scrutiny to the nature <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> delegated to them. The nondelegation doctrine applies to delegations by Congress-not to agencies 2 ̆ 7 <b>subdelegations</b> <b>of</b> legislative <b>power</b> to private parties. The other doctrinal lens for reviewing rulemaking by entities other than Congress [...] Chevron U. S. A. v. National Resources Defense Council, Inc. and its progeny-is equally blind to <b>subdelegations</b> <b>of</b> policymaking authority to parties that function beyond the boundaries of the Constitution. This Article takes up the issue of private rulemaking, and argues that its inescapable constitutional implications warrant a stronger nondelegation doctrine and a morenuanced approach to Chevron that emphasizes public accountability,legitimacy, transparency, and rational decision-making over notions of agency prerogative...|$|R

The maxim has had some success as an operating principle in the restriction of delegation of legislative and judicial powers, but the demands of modern governmental regulatory practices have inhibited its application in the delegation <b>of</b> administrative <b>powers.</b> Exceptions are rare and dependent on the statute conferring power.|$|R

2500|$|During the Mexican War of Independence, various insurgents such as Ignacio and Rafael López Rayón, José María Liceaga, Julián and Francisco Villagrán and Luis Herrera found refuge here. The most {{important}} person to do so was Mariano Matamoros, who was here from 1807 to 1808. During this time, he offered his services as priest at the Landa mission church. [...] In 1825, Landa {{was part of the}} municipality of Jalpan according to the first state constitution. Until 1917, Landa was a <b>subdelegation</b> <b>of</b> the district/municipality of Jalpan de Serra. In this year, it was made a full delegation, and the community of Landa was recognized as a town.

50|$|Chile's {{interest}} in expanding into {{the islands of}} the Pacific Ocean dates to the presidency of José Joaquín Prieto (1831-1841) and the ideology of Diego Portales, who considered that Chile's expansion into Polynesia was a natural consequence of its maritime destiny. Nonetheless, {{the first stage of}} the country's expansionism into the Pacific began only a decade later, in 1851, when—in response to an American incursion into the Juan Fernández Islands—Chile's government formally organized the islands into a <b>subdelegation</b> <b>of</b> Valparaíso. That same year, Chile's economic {{interest in}} the Pacific were renewed after its merchant fleet briefly succeeded in creating an agricultural goods exchange market that connected the Californian port of San Francisco with Australia. By 1861, Chile had established a lucrative enterprise across the Pacific, its national currency abundantly circulating throughout Polynesia and its merchants trading in the markets of Tahiti, New Zealand, Tasmania, Shanghai; negotiations were also made with the Spanish Philippines, and altercations reportedly occurred between Chilean and American whalers in the Sea of Japan. This period ended {{as a result of the}} Chilean merchant fleet's destruction by Spanish forces in 1866, during the Chincha Islands War.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Mexican War of Independence, authorities arrested the head of Indian communities along with suspected insurgents in October 1810. This was despite the fact that Nahua groups had organized to defend against the insurgents upon hearing that they were enemies of the king and planned to destroy churches. One accused insurgent was José Antonio Díaz, the parish priest of Almoloyán and friend of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. Later he would join the insurgent army. During the war, the city of Colima was taken by the insurgents Jose Antonio Torres at the end of 1810 without resistance and taken back by the royalist army in 1811. [...] In 1811, royalist troops defeated the insurgents under José Calixto Martinez at the Battle of Los Llanos de Santa Juana. Insurgents took back the city in 1812 under the command of Ignacio Sandoval and Miguel Gallaga. In 1813, the city was in royalist hands with the city swearing allegiance to the monarchist constitution. In 1821 the Plan of Iguala for Mexican independence was proclaimed in the city, and accepted by local authorities. Immediately after Independence, Colima was still a <b>subdelegation</b> <b>of</b> Guadalajara. In 1821, Colima lost the Zapotlán areas along with the towns of Tecalitlán and Xilotlán, but gained the town of Tonila. This and earlier losses of territory would define the area’s modern borders.|$|R

40|$|This article {{refers to}} Hans J.

It considers some problems with the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> Poland {{as well as some}} specific features <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> relations in East-Central Europe. Considering the idea <b>of</b> <b>power</b> present in Morgenthau’s political thought the author indicates the flexibility of this concept as well as some Morgenthau’s warnings against a narrow and single-factor understanding <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> Discussing the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> Poland the article underlines both material and some less tangible factors, including the social reception of the liberal reforms. The relations of Poland with Russia and Germany illustrate the relative character <b>of</b> <b>power</b> as both neigbours remain much more powerful countries in any aspects <b>of</b> <b>power</b> defined by Morgenthau. Besides, the Morgenthau’s concept <b>of</b> <b>power</b> helps to identify some regional problems that may destabilize the political relations in Europe. Thus the effective Polish foreign policy should be based on the proper evaluation <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and intentions <b>of</b> its two key neigbours as well as the understanding of mechanisms accompanying the power relations in the region...|$|R
