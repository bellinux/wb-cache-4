25|$|Throughout these events, Desmond learns of {{allusions to}} the prophetic {{end of the}} world in 2012 from a former Animus test subject, Subject 16; the event {{turns out to be a}} repeat of the {{disaster}} which wiped out the ancient civilization, and he finds out that his memories hold the key to Earth's surviving a second <b>solar</b> <b>storm.</b> During his experiences, Desmond is aided by holographic projections of three of the ancient race's rulers: Jupiter, Minerva, and Juno.|$|E
25|$|GPS {{compasses}} {{share the}} main advantages of gyrocompasses. They determine true North, {{as opposed to}} magnetic North, and they are unaffected by perturbations of the Earth's magnetic field. Additionally, compared with gyrocompasses, they are much cheaper, they work better in polar regions, they are less prone {{to be affected by}} mechanical vibration, and they can be initialized far more quickly. However, they depend on the functioning of, and communication with, the GPS satellites, which might be disrupted by an electronic attack or by the effects of a severe <b>solar</b> <b>storm.</b> Gyrocompasses remain in use for military purposes (especially in submarines, where magnetic and GPS compasses are useless), but have been largely superseded by GPS compasses, with magnetic backups, in civilian contexts.|$|E

The {{mission is}} to study distributions of ionospheric and thermospheric densities, geomagnetic disturbances, and ionospheric irregularities. This mission relates to the Sun and <b>solar</b> <b>storms</b> in that it studies the effects of <b>solar</b> <b>storms</b> on geospace. This mission can save astronauts and satellites.|$|R

500|$|In the episode, the TARDIS is {{hit by a}} <b>solar</b> <b>storm,</b> {{sending the}} Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) to a monastery on an island on Earth in the 22nd century, which has been {{converted}} into a factory to pump acid off the island. To prevent death from the acid, the workers have utilized a [...] "programmable matter" [...] called the Flesh, which creates a doppelgänger (called [...] "Ganger") controlled by the worker. As the <b>solar</b> <b>storm</b> hits, the Gangers become independent, and the Doctor, Amy and Rory must work to prevent the two groups from breaking into a war.|$|E
500|$|Following from [...] "The Rebel Flesh", alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) and {{his companions}} Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) are on an acid-pumping factory on a remote island in the 22nd century where {{the crew of the}} factory create [...] "Gangers", the Flesh duplicates they control. However, a <b>solar</b> <b>storm</b> has caused the Gangers to become conscious, and the Doctor must prevent a war breaking out between the humans and Gangers.|$|E
500|$|Most {{scientific}} estimates, however, {{say that}} geomagnetic reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to complete, {{and do not}} start on any particular date. Furthermore, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that the solar maximum would peak in late 2013 or 2014, {{and that it would}} be fairly weak, with a below-average number of sunspots. In any case, there was no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a geomagnetic reversal, which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth. Instead, a solar maximum would be mostly notable for its effects on satellite and cellular phone communications. David Morrison attributed the rise of the <b>solar</b> <b>storm</b> idea to physicist and science popularizer Michio Kaku, who claimed in an interview with Fox News that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites, and to NASA's headlining a 2006 webpage as [...] "Solar Storm Warning", a term later repeated on several doomsday pages.|$|E

50|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>storms</b> {{are caused}} by {{disturbances}} on the Sun, most often coronal clouds associated with solar flare CMEs emanating from active sunspot regions, or less often from coronal holes. The Sun can produce intense geomagnetic and proton storms capable of causing power outages, disruption or communications blackouts (including GPS systems) and temporary/permanent disabling of satellites and other spaceborne technology. <b>Solar</b> <b>storms</b> may be hazardous to high-latitude, high-altitude aviation and to human spaceflight. Geomagnetic storms cause aurorae.|$|R

500|$|The TARDIS {{is caught}} in the first waves of a [...] "solar tsunami" [...] and materialises on Earth in the 22nd century. The Doctor, Amy and Rory find {{themselves}} on a remote island, where a factory housed in a former castle monastery pumps a valuable, highly corrosive acid to the mainland. The skeleton crew of the factory uses a self-replicating fluid called the Flesh from which they create doppelgängers of themselves, colloquially called [...] "Gangers". The crew control the Gangers from special harnesses, operating in the hazardous environment of the factory via the disposable bodies. The Doctor, initially posing as a weatherman, fears {{the worst part of}} the solar tsunami will strike the solar-powered factory soon, threatening those still remaining, and offers to take the crew in his TARDIS. The foreman, Miranda Cleaves (Raquel Cassidy), refuses to shut down the factory until she receives orders from the mainland. As the <b>solar</b> <b>storm</b> begins, the Doctor races to disconnect the solar collector, but an electrical strike hits the castle, throwing the Doctor off the tower and knocking everyone inside unconscious.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that a <b>solar</b> <b>storm</b> of this {{magnitude}} occurring today would likely cause more widespread problems for a modern and technology-dependent society.

40|$|Several {{topics are}} {{discussed}} in this review of the solar cycle. The basic solar-interplanetary magnetic structure is considered, and the high speed solar wind streams and their sunspot cycle variation are described, with attention to the sunspot cycle variation, the high speed solar wind streams and geomagnetic disturbances, and the causes of changes of the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field. <b>Solar</b> <b>storms,</b> <b>solar</b> flares, and magnetic bubbles are examined with attention directed to the solar cycle variation of transient polar activities and the interplanetary disturbances associated with <b>solar</b> <b>storms.</b> Some features of cosmic rays, the 11 -year cycle variation and the Forbush decreases, are considered. Attention is also directed to the terrestrial atmosphere and to the outer planets and their relation to the solar cycle...|$|R
50|$|On Earth, auroras are {{triggered}} by <b>solar</b> <b>storms</b> of energetic particles, which disturb Earth's magnetic field.

40|$|Until recently, {{electricity}} utilities in mid- and low-latitude regions believed that <b>solar</b> <b>storms</b> had no (or only insignificant) {{effect on their}} power systems. Then it was noticed that the onset of damage in several large transformers, leading to their failure, correlated very closely with the Halloween storm of 2003. Since then engineers have started to appreciate that a very severe storm could have serious consequences outside the high-latitude regions. There are many uncertainties in predicting the effects of <b>solar</b> <b>storms</b> on electrical systems. The severity and time of arrival of a storm are difficult to model; so are the geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) expected to flow in the power networks. Published information about the responses {{of different types of}} transformers to GICs is contradictory. Measurements of the abnormal power flows in networks during <b>solar</b> <b>storms</b> generally do {{not take into account the}} effects of the current distortion and unbalance, potentially giving misleading signals to the operators. The normal requirement for optimum system management, while allowing for the possibility of faults caused by lightning, birds and other causes, limits the capacity of system operators to respond to the threats of GICs, which are not assessed easily by the N −  1 reliability criterion. A utility’s response to the threat of damage by GICs depends on the expected frequency and magnitude of <b>solar</b> <b>storms.</b> Approaches to formulating a response are located in a system model incorporating space physics, network analysis, transformer engineering, network reliability and decision support and the benefits are identified. Approaches adopted in high-latitude regions might not be appropriate where fewer storms are expected to reach damaging levels. The risks of an extreme storm cannot be ignored, and understanding the response mechanisms suitable for low-latitude regions has the capacity to inform and reduce the uncertainty for power systems planners and operators worldwide...|$|R
