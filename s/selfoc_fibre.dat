40|$|An {{analysis}} is given of dispersion in an optical fibre waveguide having a continuous radial variation of refractive index using the scalar wave approximation. Solutions are presented {{for the particular}} case of <b>Selfoc</b> <b>fibre</b> taking into account mode dispersion, material dispersion and group delay. It is shown that for a correctly matched input Gaussian beam the pulse dispersion is small although in practice {{it is likely to}} be ~ 1 ns over a length of 1 km...|$|E
