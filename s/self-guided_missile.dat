50|$|Iron Dome: an Israeli missile system {{featuring}} multiple-target {{tracking and}} <b>self-guided</b> <b>missile</b> interceptors. Due {{to the ongoing}} increase of its engagement range and new missile and interception improvements, plus Surface-to-air missile capability, it has developed into a fully-fledged air defence system. By November 2012, the system had intercepted over 400 rockets fired into Israel by Gaza Strip militants. Based on operational success, defense reporter Mark Thompson estimates that Iron Dome is currently the most-effective and most-tested counter missile system in existence.|$|E
5000|$|Dreadnought was a Cardassian <b>self-guided</b> <b>missile,</b> {{containing}} {{one thousand}} kilograms of matter, and another thousand of antimatter. Tuvok describes this as enough {{to destroy a}} small moon. Although described as a <b>self-guided</b> <b>missile,</b> in practice Dreadnought functions much like an autonomous starship, and it even had life support capability on board. It possesses shields, phasers, a complement of quantum torpedoes, a Thoron shock emitter, a plasma wave weapon, engines capable of reaching at least Warp 9, and a sophisticated computer AI. It appears in the Voyager episode of the same name. It had been captured by the Maquis due to a failed detonator and reprogrammed to attack its original creators. It was dragged into the Delta Quadrant {{in much the same}} manner as Voyager, and when unable to resolve the unforeseen situation it locked on to a planet that was similar to the one it was programmed to target, but which was inhabited by innocents. Dreadnought was equipped with an exceptionally sophisticated artificial intelligence, capable of [...] "paranoia" [...] to a certain degree, as when reprogrammer B'Elanna Torres attempted to prevent it from destroying the innocent planet, it {{came to the conclusion that}} she had been captured by her Cardassian enemies and forced to make up a story to prevent the attack; it then pretended to follow her commands and shut down, only to re-activate and continue its mission once she was no longer aboard.|$|E
5000|$|Strategically, the Eighth Fleet's goal is {{to instill}} enough {{operational}} caution and sensitivity to losses in Haven to force redeployments of starships in defensive postures, reducing Haven's offensive resources. To expedite this, they are assigned the lion's share of Manticore's cutting-edge warfighting hardware, including the new [...] "Apollo" [...] <b>self-guided</b> <b>missile</b> system and [...] "Keyhole" [...] platforms that increase the efficacy of their own counter-missiles. Their first two raids do indeed instill some panic into the Havenite populace, but on the third, at Solon, a defensive ambush led by Admiral Javier Giscard is waiting for them. Honor is sorely trounced, losing several ships and being forced to abandon a vessel captained by her best friend, Admiral Michelle [...] "Mike" [...] Henke, Countess Gold Peak, to its own devices; Henke is believed killed in action.|$|E

50|$|BRAMS - Self-propelled Anti-aircraft System is an {{automated}} anti-aircraft system designated for destroying low flying targets using its twin barrel 30 mm gun with {{high rate of}} fire and 4 <b>self-guided</b> anti-aircraft <b>missiles.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Radioplane Company was an American {{aviation}} company which produced drone aircraft primarily {{for use as}} gunnery targets. During World War II they produced over 9,400 of their Radioplane OQ-3 model, a propeller-powered monoplane, making it the most-used target aircraft in the US. In the post-World War II era they introduced their Radioplane BTT series, which was produced for years and eventually reached almost 60,000 examples. They also produced several radio control and <b>self-guided</b> <b>missiles,</b> the largest being the GAM-67 Crossbow, which didn't enter service. The company was purchased by Northrop Corporation in 1952, and moved to one of Northrop's factories in 1962. One of the last projects carried out at the original Radioplane factory in Van Nuys, California, was {{the construction of the}} Gemini Paraglider.|$|R
5000|$|Similar in {{purpose to}} the Cardassian Dreadnought, the Tactical Armor Units are <b>self-guided</b> <b>missiles</b> with {{sophisticated}} artificial intelligence. They are {{much smaller than}} Dreadnought, being {{only a few feet}} in length, and while nowhere near as powerful, they are nonetheless classified as weapons of mass destruction, capable of destroying everything in a 200-kilometer radius with a highly focused antimatter explosion. Their coordination and control is done through a [...] "Strategic Command Matrix", analogous to a nuclear control network of the type used by the United States. Each one possesses shielding, warp drive of indeterminate speed, and a sentient, genius-level artificial intelligence programmed to do whatever is necessary to reach their targets and detonate. They can detect and prevent tampering, are intelligent enough to find a way past almost any obstacle, and can win engagements even when outnumbered. They were created by a Delta Quadrant race called the Druoda, and the devices were greatly feared for their endurance and tenacity.|$|R
50|$|Spaceflight {{is similar}} in style to the Wing Commander or X-Wing titles. Most races {{initially}} adopt a neutral stance towards the player, unless they ambush the player in between star systems. The player can then choose to attack or hold their fire, which can influence future relations with that species. The player may also choose to launch an unguided probe to initiate communications with neutral or friendly species. The player-controllable vehicles consist of the main Trailblazer-class cruiser (top left screenshot on box back) and small spacecraft chassis that can be quickly reconfigured for three different roles (that of a space superiority fighter, a powerful <b>self-guided</b> kamikaze <b>missile</b> with poor maneuverability or a weak homing missile with excellent maneuverability). The player can also launch an escape pod if the Trailblazer is hopelessly crippled.|$|R
2500|$|Early {{on in the}} Buccaneer's career, {{conventional}} anti-ship missions {{would have}} employed a mix of iron bombs and rockets at close range. [...] This tactic became increasingly impractical {{in the face of}} Soviet anti-aircraft missile advances, thus later Buccaneers were adapted to make use of several missiles capable of striking enemy ships from a distance. [...] The Anglo-French Martel missile was introduced upon the Buccaneer, but its operational experience was described as having been [...] "very temperamental", and its deployment required an attacking Buccaneer to increase its altitude and thus its vulnerability to being attacked itself. [...] An extensive upgrade programme undertaken in the 1980s enabled compatibility with several new pieces of equipment; including the Sea Eagle <b>missile,</b> a <b>self-guiding</b> 'fire-and-forget' <b>missile</b> capable of striking targets at an effective range of , five times that of the Martel AJ 168 anti-ship missile, and also being significantly more powerful.|$|R
