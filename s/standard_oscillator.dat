We extend the <b>standard</b> <b>oscillator</b> construction of the unitary representations of non-compact Lie superalgebras over standard Fock spaces to generalised Fock spaces which allows us to define the action of oscillator determinants raised to non-integer powers. We prove that the proposed construction yields all the unitary representations including those with continuous labels.

We apply our general results to the physically important case of four-dimensional conformal superalgebra su(2, 2 | 4) and show how it yields readily its unitary representations including those corresponding to supermultiplets of conformal fields with continuous (anomalous) scaling dimensions.

40|$|Experimentalists {{seeking to}} improve the {{coherent}} lifetimes of quantum bits have generally focused on mitigating decoherence mechanisms through, for example, improvements to qubit designs and materials, and system isolation from environmental perturbations. In {{the case of the}} phase degree of freedom in a quantum superposition, however, the coherence that must be preserved is not solely internal to the qubit, but rather necessarily includes that of the qubit relative to the "master clock" (e. g. a local oscillator) that governs its control system. In this manuscript we articulate the impact of instabilities in the master clock on qubit phase coherence, and provide tools to calculate the contributions to qubit error arising from these processes. We first connect <b>standard</b> <b>oscillator</b> phase-noise metrics to their corresponding qubit dephasing spectral densities. We then use representative lab-grade and performance-grade oscillator specifications to calculate operational fidelity bounds on trapped-ion and superconducting qubits with relatively slow and fast operation times. We discuss the relevance of these bounds for quantum error correction in contemporary experiments and future large-scale quantum information systems, and discuss potential means to improve master clock stability.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain free kappa-deformed quantum fields (with c-number commutators) we {{proposed}} new concept of kappa-deformed oscillator algebra [1] and the modification of kappa-star product [2], implementing in the product of two quantum fields the change of standard kappa-deformed mass-shell conditions. We recall here that the kappa-deformed oscillators recently introduced in [3]-[5] lie on standard kappa-deformed mass-shell. Firstly, we study kappa-deformed fields with the standard kappa-star product, what implies that in the oscillator algebra the corresponding kappa-deformed oscillators lie on standard kappa-deformed mass-shell. We argue that for the kappa-deformed algebra of such field oscillators which carry fourmomenta on kappa-deformed mass-shell {{it is not possible}} to obtain the free quantum kappa-deformed fields with the c-number commutators. Further, we study kappa-deformed quantum fields with the modified kappa-star product which implies the modification of kappa-deformed mass-shell. We obtain large class of kappa-deformed statistics depending on six arbitrary functions which provides the c-number field commutator functions. Such general class of kappa-oscillators can be described as the kappa-deformation of <b>standard</b> <b>oscillator</b> algebra obtained by composing general kappa-deformed multiplication with the deformation of the flip operator.

40|$|In {{this work}} we have {{investigated}} some properties of classical phase-space with symplectic structures consistent, at the classical level, with two noncommutative (NC) algebras: the Doplicher-Fredenhagen-Roberts algebraic {{relations and the}} NC approach which uses an extended Hilbert space with rotational symmetry. This extended Hilbert space includes the operators θ^ij and their conjugate momentum π_ij operators. In this scenario, the equations of motion for all extended phase-space coordinates with their corresponding solutions were determined and a rotational invariant NC Newton's second law was written. As an application, we treated a NC harmonic oscillator constructed in this extended Hilbert space. We have showed precisely that its solution is still periodic {{if and only if}} the ratio between the frequencies of oscillation is a rational number. We investigated, analytically and numerically, the solutions of this NC oscillator in a two-dimensional phase-space. The result led us to conclude that noncommutativity induces a stable perturbation into the commutative <b>standard</b> <b>oscillator</b> and that the rotational symmetry is not broken. Besides, we have demonstrated through the equations of motion that a zero momentum π_ij originated a constant NC parameter, namely, θ^ij=const., which changes the original variable characteristic of θ^ij and reduces the phase-space of the system. This result shows that the momentum π_ij is relevant and cannot be neglected when we have that θ^ij is a coordinate of the system. Comment: 18 pages. JHEP style. Corrections mad...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{micromachining}} using femtosecond pulses, is a {{most promising}} and versatile technique, having a variety of applications. The main features are an efficient and localized energy deposition, low ablation thresholds and no thermal and mechanical damage of the substrate material. The maximum benefits are obtained when one operates just above ablation or modification threshold. Under typical focusing conditions the required energies are 10 s of nJ, which is slightly above the output of standard femtosecond oscillators. Amplified laser systems {{on the other hand}} are overkill for microstructuring as the pulse energy has to be strongly attenuated, resulting in a low average output power and process speed. This limits the achievable throughput and effects the overall process quality. The Chirped Pulsed Oscillator (CPO) is a new approach that resolves this problem. By adding a multipass cell into a <b>standard</b> <b>oscillator,</b> the cavity is extended. The low repetition rate results in pulse energies an order of magnitude higher.

40|$|Voltage {{controlled}} oscillators (VCOs) {{are essential}} components of RF circuits used in transmitters and receivers {{as sources of}} carrier waves with variable frequencies. This, together with a rapid development of microelectronic circuits, led to an extensive research on integrated implementations of the oscillator circuits. One of the known approaches to oscillator design employs resonators with active inductors electronic circuits simulating the behavior of passive inductors using only transistors and capacitors. Such resonators occupy {{only a fraction of}} the silicon area necessary for a passive inductor, and thus allow to use chip area more eectively. The downsides of the active inductor approach include: power consumption and noise introduced by transistors. This thesis presents a new approach to active inductor oscillator design using selfoscillating active inductor circuits. The instability necessary to start oscillations is provided by the use of a passive RC network rather than a power consuming external circuit employed in the <b>standard</b> <b>oscillator</b> approach. As a result, total power consumption of the oscillator is improved. Although, some of the active inductors with RC circuits has been reported in the literature, there has been no attempt to utilise this technique in wideband voltage controlled oscillator design. For this reason, the dissertation presents a thorough investigation of self-oscillating active inductor circuits, providing a new set of design rules and related trade-os. This includes: a complete small signal model of the oscillator, sensitivity analysis, large signal behavior of the circuit and phase noise model. The presented theory is conrmed by extensive simulations of wideband CMOS VCO circuit for various temperatures and process variations. The obtained results prove that active inductor oscillator performance is obtained without the use of standard active compensation circuits. Finally, the concept of self-oscillating active inductor has been employed to simple and fast OOK (On-Off Keying) transmitter showing energy eciency comparable to the state of the art implementations reported in the literature...|$|E
