50|$|<b>Specim,</b> Spectral Imaging Ltd is a European {{technology}} firm {{headquartered in}} Oulu, Finland. <b>Specim</b> manufactures and sells imaging spectrographs, hyperspectral cameras and systems. Specim's airborne AISA hyperspectral cameras have been utilized {{for example in}} monitoring the environmental effects of major industrial catastrophes such as Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Red mud spill.|$|E

40|$|Hyperspectral {{remote sensing}} {{technology}} can help monitor hemlock health across {{large areas of}} the landscape. This study examines the capability of a commercially available sensor (<b>Specim’s</b> AISA Eagle) to map hemlock decline due to hemlock wooly adelgid (HWA) infestation in the Catskill Mountain area of New York. The AISA Eagle was able to classify hemlock health at the tree level into an 11 -class rating system with a one-class tolerance accuracy of 88 percent. The ability of this instrument to predict decline below class 4 (when dieback and transparency reach levels first noticeable in the field) is based upon “pre-visual” changes in chlorophyll content and function that are typical of incipient HWA infestation and early stress. This technology will enable land managers to assess and monitor detailed changes in forest health across the landscape so that integrated pest management programs can be effectively implemented...|$|R

30|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was investigated}} by a VNIR hyperspectral camera by <b>Specim</b> (Oulu, Finland). The camera was {{mounted on a}} rotation stage to acquire the images in push broom technique, i.e. by scanning the manuscript horizontally and acquiring full spectral information for one vertical line on the manuscript at a time. The spectral range was 400 – 1000  nm with 212 wavelength channels (rebinned from 1200) with a spectral sampling of 2.8  nm and 1600 spatial pixels. Two objectives were used. With the first one (OL 17, <b>Specim,</b> focal length 17  mm), one image of the entire miniature was acquired with a spatial sampling of approx. 250  μm at a camera-manuscript distance of 62  cm. The scan was acquired with 50  ms integration time, 6  fps (frames per second) and 0.01 /s rotation speed. With the second one (OL 50, <b>Specim,</b> focal length 50  mm), smaller zones were imaged with a spatial sampling of approximately 40  μm. In this “zoom” configuration (distance camera-manuscript of 40  cm), the acquisition parameters were 200  ms integration time, 4 fps and 0.07 /s rotation speed. During the investigation, diffuse illumination is provided by three 20  W halogen lamps, placed at 0.4  m away. The data was normalized with dark and bright field images using the <b>Specim</b> plug-in in ENVI (Harris Corporation, Melbourne, Florida, USA). To check {{the quality of the}} reflectance image cube the reflectance spectra from the white and black diffuse reflectance standards placed in the image scene were examined: they showed in the range between 450 and 900  nm a noise level of 1.7 % reflectance for the white reference and 0.5 % for the dark reference.|$|E

As a result, the acquired spectral cube contains a full spectrum at each image pixel, that, just like in reflectance spectroscopy, can be related to the sample’s surface material composition.|$|E

The CCD camera has a 1600 × 840 pixels resolution; the entrance slit is 30 μm wide. The focal length of the lens is 23 mm. The translation system measures 1.30 m and was controlled by IDAQ software. The hyperspectral system works horizontally or vertically. Two halogen lamps illuminate the sample. A Prophotonix Cobra slim UV line scan illuminator of 30 °Cm also allows excitation at 365 nm for UV fluorescence imaging. The treatment of the data cube is performed with ENVI 5.0 + IDL software.

40|$|Hyperspectral remote-sensing in the {{reflected}} infrared and thermal infrared regions offers {{a unique and}} efficient alternative for mineral mapping, as most minerals exhibit spectral features in these regions, mainly in the shortwave and longwave infrared. Airborne hyperspectral data in both spectral regions, acquired with the AisaFENIX and AisaOWL (<b>Specim)</b> sensors over Makhtesh Ramon in Israel, were analyzed. Calculating the reflectance and emissivity spectra of each pixel in the shortwave infrared and longwave infrared region images, respectively, and determining mineral indices enabled identifying the dominant minerals in this area—kaolinite, calcite, dolomite, quartz, feldspars and gypsum—and mapping their spatial distribution in the surface. The benefit of using hyperspectral data from both reflected infrared and thermal infrared regions to improve mineral identification was demonstrated...|$|E

The downwelling irradiance data, however, are rarely used for any atmospheric correction or compensation of different sun-sensor geometry, partly because they are sensitive towards continuous motion of the airborne platform. The airborne hyperspectral system AISA Eagle (<b>Specim,</b> Ltd., Finland), combined with the Fiber Optic Downwelling Irradiance Sensor (FODIS), were used for ground-based outdoor static measurements. The FODIS sensor was tilted into various zenith and azimuth angles. The data analysis revealed high sensitivity of the raw recorded FODIS signal towards different angular position. Simple cosine corrections reduced variation in the recorded FODIS signal. The variability (standard deviation of all measurements) decreased by 88...|$|E
