25|$|VPID (or video payload identifier) packets are {{increasingly}} {{used to describe}} the video format. In early versions of the <b>serial</b> <b>digital</b> <b>interface,</b> it was always possible to uniquely determine the video format by counting the number of lines and samples between H and V transitions in the TRS. With the introduction of dual link interfaces, and segmented-frame standards, this is no longer possible; thus the VPID standard (defined by SMPTE 352M) provides a way to uniquely and unambiguously identify the format of the video payload.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>serial</b> <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces</b> use a {{separate}} clock pin {{to signal the}} arrival of individual bits of data. However, Wozniak decided that {{a separate}} wire for a clock signal was not necessary; and as ADB {{was designed to be}} low-cost, it made economical sense to leave it out.

The Y, Cr, and Cb samples are co-sited (acquired at the same instance in time), and the Y' sample is acquired at the time halfway between two adjacent Y samples.|$|R
25|$|In {{the high}} {{definition}} <b>serial</b> <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> (and in dual-link HD), additional check words are provided {{to increase the}} robustness of the interface. In these formats, the four samples immediately following the EAV packets (but not the SAV packets) contain a cyclic redundancy check field, and a line count indicator. The CRC field provides a CRC of the preceding line (CRCs are computed independently for the Y and C streams), {{and can be used}} to detect bit errors in the interface. The line count field indicates the line number of the current line.|$|E
25|$|For HDTV applications, the <b>serial</b> <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> {{is defined}} by SMPTE 292M. Two bit rates are defined, 1.485Gbit/s, and 1.485/1.001Gbit/s.

The 1.485Gbit/s version of the standard supports other frame rates in widespread use, including 60Hz, 50Hz, 30Hz, 25Hz, and 24Hz. It is common to collectively refer to both standards as using a nominal bit rate of 1.5Gbit/s.|$|E

50|$|To enable {{applications}} to sense, control, {{and communicate with}} a single low-power microcontroller, the EFM32 MCUs contain complete analog and <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces.</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces</b> include USART, low energy UART, I2C, and USB. The timer and triggers block of the MCU includes a cryotimer, low energy pulse counter (PCNT), and backup Real-Time-Counter (RTC). Analog modules include ADCs, DACs, Operational Amplifiers, and analog comparators. For applications that demand heightened security protections, the EFM32 MCUs offer various hardware crypto engines and cyclic redundancy check (CRC). For general I/O, the MCUs feature up to 93 GPIO pins, and several variants feature LCD controllers.|$|R

2500|$|The various <b>serial</b> <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> {{standards}} all use (one or more) coaxial cables with BNC connectors, with {{a nominal}} impedance of 75 ohms. This {{is the same}} type of cable used in analog video setups, which potentially makes for easier upgrades (though higher quality cables may be necessary for long runs at the higher bitrates). The specified signal amplitude at the source is 800 mV (Â±10%) peak-to-peak; far lower voltages may be measured at the receiver owing to attenuation. Using equalization at the receiver, it is possible to send 270Mbit/s SDI over [...] without use of repeaters, but shorter lengths are preferred.

2500|$|These {{standards}} {{are used for}} transmission of uncompressed, unencrypted digital video signals (optionally including embedded audio and time code) within television facilities; {{they can also be}} used for packetized data. Coaxial variants of the specification range in length but are typically less than [...] Fiber optic variants of the specification such as 297M allow for long-distance transmission limited only by maximum fiber length or repeaters. SDI and HD-SDI are usually available only in professional video equipment because various licensing agreements restrict the use of unencrypted digital interfaces, such as SDI, prohibiting their use in consumer equipment. Several professional video and HD-video capable DSLR cameras and all uncompressed video capable consumer cameras use the HDMI interface, often called clean HDMI. There are various mod kits for existing DVD players and other devices, which allow a user to add a <b>serial</b> <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> to these devices.|$|E

DVCPRO achieves bitrate parity with D-9 and D-9 HD, but has a slower tape speed, making it less reliable. Some of the D-9 television studio gear is capable of recording with Sel-Sync or pre-read and is provided with four-channel audio like <b>Digital</b> Betacam. <b>Serial</b> <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces</b> (SDI) are also provided.

40|$|The {{emerging}} market of digital 3 -D film productions in HD resolution {{leads to the}} need for high-quality equipment in the production chain. The incoming video streams of the two cameras require an image rectification due to unavoidable misalignments within the stereoscopic camera setup. This rectification can either take place in postprocessing of the recorded material or it can be applied in real time during the shooting. Especially in the case of streaming and recording of live events, real-time processing is necessary and, additionally, the system has to provide a very low latency. We present a hardware image rectification engine, which supports the processing of stereo high-definition <b>serial</b> <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces</b> video streams with up to 1080 p 30 video with a latency below 1 ms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low-power encoding technique, called chromatic encoding, for the <b>Digital</b> Visual <b>Interface</b> standard (DVI), a <b>digital</b> <b>serial</b> video <b>interface.</b> Chromatic encoding reduces power consumption by minimizing the transition counts on the DVI. This technique {{relies on the}} notion of tonal locality, i. e., the observation - first made in this paper - that the signal differences between adjacent pixels in images follow a Gaussian distribution. Based on this observation, an optimal code assignment is performed to minimize the transition counts. Furthermore, the three color channels of the DVI may be reciprocally encoded to achieve even more power saving. The idea is that given the signal values from the three color channels, one or two of these channels are encoded by reciprocal differences with a number of redundant bits used to indicate the selection. The channel selection problem is formulated as a minimum spanning tree problem and solved accordingly. The proposed technique requires only three redundant bits for each 24 -bit pixel.
