In this paper, wavelet neural network is used to identify the acoustic emission signals from different types of tanks. Using wavelet transform and threshold denoising to denoise the detection signals, after wavelet packet decomposition, each node's energy distribution and the feature vectors of extracted corrosion signals of the tank floor are selected as the input. At last, the compact-type wavelet neural network is chosen to recognize different AE signals. The result of magnetic flux leakage test proves that this method can improve acoustic emission signal analysis precision and achieve the accurate corrosion evaluation based on AE technology...|$|R
40|$|A simple noncontact {{force sensor}} {{based on an}} optical fiber Bragg grating {{attached}} to a small magnet has been proposed and built. The sensor measures the force between the magnet and any ferromagnetic material placed within a few millimeters of the sensor. Maintaining the sensor at a constant standoff distance, material loss due to corrosion increases {{the distance between the}} magnet and the corroded surface, which decreases the magnetic force. This will decrease the strain in the optical fiber shifting the reflected Bragg wavelength. The measured shift for the optical fiber used was 1. 36 nm per Newton. Models were developed to optimize the magnet geometry for a specific sensor standoff distance and for particular corrosion pit depths. The sensor was able to detect corrosion pits on a fuel <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> <b>bottom</b> with depths in the sub-millimeter range...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} experimental {{result of a}} system to absorb solar energy to heat up a desalination tower with heat recovery mechanism and a change made in the heated water distribution at the heat <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> The system to absorb solar energy consists of solar thermal flat plate collectors for high temperatures and it responsible for the conversion of solar radiation in thermal energy to heat up the water to be desalinated. The change made in the <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> consists of the installation of a stainless steel pipe with holes equally spaced and arrangement to allow a better distribution of the hot water from the solar collectors in the heat <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> The desalination unit has two components: two high temperatures solar collectors and a desalination tower with six stages. In its operation, water is heated in the solar collectors and moves by natural convection to the <b>storage</b> <b>tank,</b> to the <b>bottom</b> of the tower. In the tank, the water transfers heat to the salty water {{in the first stage}} of the tower. This heated water transfer heat by evaporation, convection and radiation to the second stage and part of its energy is lost to the ambient. The condensed vapor {{on the walls of the}} stages flows down by gravity to be collected in a reservoir installed under the desalination tower. The heat received by the second stage is used to heat up the ater in this stage and the process is repeated in all stages. The performance of the desalination unit was satisfactory. The temperature in the <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> reached values near 85 ÂC and the water temperatures at the outlet of the solar collector were near 100 ÂC. The daily production was 31 liters of desalinated water and the GOR-value (gain output ratio) was 1, 5...|$|R
40|$|The {{average age}} of bulk liquid <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> in the petroleum, chemical, pulp and paper {{industries}} is increasing. Accordingly, the need for environmental and safety inspections is increasing. Current structural and corrosion inspection practices for aboveground <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> (ASTs) requires: drainage of the product; cleaning of the vessel with water or solvents; physical removal, collection and containment of petroleum and chemical waste residues, including the waste streams created by the cleaning process; ventilation and certification of gas-free conditions for manned entry into the tank which frequently requires that inspection personnel be in a full protective suit with fresh air supply; and, performing the corrosion inspection of the <b>tank</b> <b>bottom</b> and interior structures and structural coating systems. Current inspection devices are not capable of operating submerged or in hydrocarbon vapor environments. This expensive process can be bypassed using a remote-operated robotic inspection vehicle submerged in the liquid. Maverick is an innovative, inspection system that will improve energy efficiency and minimize or reduce hazardous waste and harmful emissions. The system can be inserted into an operational tank and perform an American Petroleum Institute (API) 653 <b>tank</b> <b>bottom</b> inspection. The primary benefits of Maverick are: -energy conservation due to elimination of need to empty and clean tanks prior to inspection -source prevention of hazardous waste and emissions -cost reduction to the petroleum and chemicals industries of performing tank inspections -increase in personnel safety due to reduced exposure to hazardous materials or gases and confined space entry...|$|R
30|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{in order to}} calculate the damping effects of viscous fluids in liquid <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> subjected to earthquakes. The potential equation of an ideal fluid can satisfy only the boundary conditions normal {{to the surface of}} the liquid. To satisfy also the tangential interaction conditions between liquid and tank wall and <b>tank</b> <b>bottom,</b> the potential flow is superimposed by a one-dimensional shear flow. The shear flow in this boundary layer yields to a decrease of the mechanical energy of the shell-liquid-system. A damping factor is derived from the mean value of the energy dissipation in time. Depending on shell geometry and fluid viscosity, modal damping ratios are calculated for the convective component.|$|R
40|$|Corrosion of {{aboveground}} <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> (AST) in hydrocarbon service shortens the tank’s {{life cycle}} {{and can lead}} to leaks and release of hazardous materials into the environment. Internal inspection {{is one of the main}} means to keep the tank’s integrity. Determination of internal inspection interval is imminent for balancing the safe operation requirement and inspection costs. In most instances, the area most vulnerable to corrosion in upright atmospheric AST is the <b>tank</b> <b>bottom.</b> In this paper we present the procedure for calculation of reasonable internal inspection interval based on deterministic method. Calculation and/or anticipation of the key parameter, the bottom plate corrosion rate is discussed. Corrosion rates between 0. 1 and 0. 9 mm year- 1 of the thank bottoms that are typically 6. 4 mm to 9. 5 mm thick show that corrosion is an important concern in the case of long-term <b>storage</b> industrial <b>tanks.</b> It is demonstrated that precise determination of the bottom plate corrosion rate is crucial for the obtaining reliable internal inspection interval...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to get a}} better {{understanding}} of how optimal weight savings of the cylindrical shell plates in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> can be reached using higher strength duplex material. The design criteria will be based on the requirements given by the American Petroleum Institute standards API 650 for welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and API 12 B for bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The expected result is that use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel can reduce the weight of the material needed to build a <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> A comparison between welded and bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will also be included in the work to find which joining method that is preferable. Additionally, an evaluation of the software TANKTM by Intergraph will be performed. Matlab® will be used in order to perform the evaluation to compare the results. The main difference between the standards API 650 and API 12 B is that there are already given standard sizes of bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> API 12 B. Therefore, only <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> up to 1   625 m 3 could be compared. When comparing <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> sizes up to 1   625 m 3 the result is that bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> require a smaller mean thickness of the cylindrical shell than welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and therefore less material and total weight of the shell. If the trend continues also for larger <b>tank</b> sizes, bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will be preferable to reduce the total weight of the <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> By use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> the minimum required thickness can be reduced because of the higher strength of duplex stainless steel. This leads to a smaller mean shell thickness and therefore a reduced weight compared to <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> made of austenitic stainless steel. For most dimensions of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> duplex stainless steel is cheaper than austenitic stainless steel, but for some smaller dimensions, grade 1. 4307 (austenitic) is cheaper than LDX 2101 ® (duplex). Instability calculations have been performed for welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> while no instability calculations have been performed for bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> With the wind speed 190 km/h (proposed by API 650), the welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> need to have wind girders to stiffen the cylindrical shell and in some cases also be anchored to the ground. Anchor is not required for large dimensions of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The evaluation of TANKTM showed that most parameters agreed to the computed value of the same parameters in Matlab®. Why a few parameters not agrees is not fully known, therefore better explanations of the parameters used in the equations in API 650 would be preferable. To see the difference between Matlab® and TANKTM it would also be of interest to see how the calculations are performed in TANKTM, as only the results and inputs are printed at the moment...|$|R
