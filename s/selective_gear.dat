With funding provided by the European Union and the DIREN (Regional Environmental Authorities), WWF commissioned a study from IFREMER (French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea) to determine which <b>selective</b> <b>gear</b> was the most adapted to fishing conditions in French Guiana. These initial trials, conducted under experimental conditions, were carried out on board a shrimp trawler. Following this work, shrimp industry’s members expressed the need to continue these experiments and to become more involved in the project.

5000|$|From the 1980s to {{the present}} day, laws and {{regulations}} on fishing have been much stricter. Today there are restrictions on vessels and gear and {{on the number of}} days fishing fleets are allowed to be out at sea. This has created an atmosphere of intense competition between fishermen and regulators, which has translated into “ghost fishing” and increased numbers of “bycatch” or [...] "bykill". For example, when regulators made the fishing season shorter, fishermen responded by increasing the size of their fishing fleets and by using more powerful ships. Incentive structures are set up so that fishermen are compelled to take drastic and irresponsible measures to ensure a catch. In efforts to maximize their earnings with increasing restrictions on fishing, many fishermen put out more hooks, lines and nets. Fouled gear is cut adrift and less <b>selective</b> <b>gear</b> is used and instances of bycatch grow dramatically. Often, fishermen exceed their catch limits and fish populations decrease faster than they can be replenished which has resulted in crashing fish stock.|$|E

Learning from previous experiences, such a procedure is being designed and tested, that would allow for a rapid and objective appraisal of fishers' suggestions ("fast-tracking"), including a combination of simulation testing, self-sampling and verification under scientific conditions. In this talk, we present the progresses achieved so far to develop this procedure. We highlight the institutional, legal, scientific and socio-cultural constraints that frame the criteria to evaluate fishers' ideas, and we discuss how such a procedure can potentially contribute to a diversification of the gears used, and increase fishers' ownership over those gears, all while sustaining a biologically sound and rentable fishery under the new Common Fishery Policy...|$|R

The plan operates through landings quotas (TACs) and effort restrictions following a Harvest Control Rule, and deploys a novel instrument allowing Member States to ‘buy back’ or increase fishing effort for fleet segments engaged in cod-avoidance measures. The stipulated fishing mortality reductions have not been achieved. On the positive side, the ‘buy-back’ instrument has led to increased uptake of <b>selective</b> <b>gear</b> and implementation of permanent and real-time temporary closures. On the negative side, ignoring the dimension of fishers as reactive agents in the design, the impact assessment, and the annual implementation of the measures {{has contributed to the}} failure to adequately implement the plan and achieve its objectives. The main problem is that the landings quotas taken in a mixed fishery did not limit catches because fishers were incentivised to continue fishing and discard overquota catch while quota for other species was available. The effort limitations intended to reduce this effect were insufficient to adequately limit fishing mortality in targeted fisheries, although fishers experienced them as prohibiting the full uptake of other quotas. Recommendations for future plans include (i) management through catch rather than landings quotas, (ii) the internalisation of the costs of exceeding quotas, (iii) use of more <b>selective</b> <b>gear</b> types, (iv) the development of appropriate metrics as a basis for regulatory measures and for evaluations, (v) participatory governance, (vi) fishery-based management, (vii) flexibility in fishing strategy at vessel level.

In this article, we focus on the reasons that ITQs do not conserve stocks.

However, this approach may not be applicable in all cases, in particular for data limited stocks, which may suffer from uncertain catch information and consequently lack reliable estimates of fishing mortality. In this study we develop an approach to obtain proxies for changes in fishing mortality based on effort information and predicted stock distribution. Cod in the Kattegat is used as an example. We use GAM analyses to predict local cod densities and combine this with spatio-temporal data of fishing effort based on VMS (Vessel Monitoring System). To quantify local fishing impact on the stock, retention probability of the gears is taken into account.

Discards of under-sized or non-commercial species/individuals represent damage to the eco-system, an additional source of overfishing and a waste of resources. Bycatch may increase fishing pressure on species targeted by other fishermen. The purpose of the paper is to investigate in a bio-economic model the scope for implementing more <b>selective</b> <b>gears</b> in the Danish mixed nephops fishery in Kattegat/Skagerrak.

The result shows that it is not an advantage to move to gear types that reduces the catches of round- and flatfish significant. The catches of nephrops do also decrease and the resulting improvements in stock biomass do not compensate enough for the overall loss due to the lower catches.

40|$|Bycatch of red {{king crab}} (Paralithodes camtschatica) in {{stationary}} fishing gears, q&ally gillnets, {{is an increasing}} problem to the inshore fishermen {{in the northern part}} of Norway (Finnmark county). The results are large bycatches of king crabs together with the crabs’ damages on the gear and catch. In the cod gillnet fisheries, the problem might be solved by using specially made gillnets (“norsel-mounted” nets) where the net itself is floated 0. 5 meters above the seabed. The norsel-mounted nets were compared with standard nets in the Varangerfjord (eastern Finnmark) in the period 17 March - 28 May 1999. The trials showed that norsel nets needed more floats than the standard nets to get the net to stand properly in the sea (to get the norsels stretched out suitably). By using extra float (rings) on the norsel mounted nets the bycatches of king crab were reduced to an acceptable level with an average of 0. 6 crabs/net, compared with 3. 3 crabs/net on standard and 6. 7 crabs/net on nor-se 1 nets without extra float. Norse 1 nets caught only about l/ 3 as many fish as standard nets. The catch results indicated that the gear configuration functioned in order to reduce the bycatch of red king crab.

Twenty types of fishing gear were classified into 6 groups, i. e. seine nets, purse seine, gillnets and trammel nets, lift nets, lines, and traps. Two of them were categorized as unselective fishing gear, i. e. seine nets and purse seine, whereas the other 4 were classified as selective ones. The number of each group was expressed in means and percentages and the development/changes thereof was presented in percentage.

40|$|Reef fishes that exhibit {{predictable}} aggregating behaviour {{are often}} considered vulnerable to overexploitation. However, fisher {{knowledge of this}} behaviour is often heterogeneous and, coupled with socioeconomic factors that constrain demand for or access to aggregated fish, will influence susceptibility to fishing. At two case study locations in Papua New Guinea, Ahus and Karkar islands, we conducted interview-based surveys to examine how local context influenced heterogeneity in knowledge of fish aggregations. We then explored the role of fisher knowledge in conferring susceptibility to fishing relative to socioeconomic drivers of fishing effort. Local heterogeneity in knowledge of aggregating behaviour differed between our case studies. At Ahus, variable access rights among fishers and genders to the main habitats were sources of heterogeneity in knowledge. By contrast, knowledge was more homogenous at Karkar and the sole source of variation was gear type. Differences between locations in the susceptibility of aggregations to fishing depended primarily on socioeconomic drivers of fishing effort rather than catchability. While Ahus fishers were knowledgeable of fish aggregations and used more <b>selective</b> <b>gears,</b> Karkar fishers were less constrained by tenure in their access to aggregation habitat. However, fishing effort was greater at Ahus and likely related to high dependency on fishing, greater access to provincial capital markets than Karkar and a weakening of customary management.

However, gill nets (punti, koi and fash jal), clasp nets (bhuti jal), some traps (khadom, tubo), hooks and lines (chip borshi, chasra) and all spears were used as more or less <b>selective</b> <b>gear.</b> With respect to species and its size fash jal, bhuti jal, trap (khadom, ramani), and koach, juti and jhupi among spears were regarded to be more or less large-species-gear. But punti jal, koi jal, trap (koi dughair, charo, tubo, arinda and ghuni), nol borshi and spear (ful-kuchi) were small-species-gear. Among all gears seine net, cast net, lift net, koi dughair and ramani were recorded deleterious for carps especially for stocked fingerlings. For relatively small sized wild fishes koi jal, punti jal and ghuni traps were identified as detrimental gear...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mest., Aquacultura e Pescas, Faculdade de Ciências do Mar e Ambiente, Universidade do Algarve, 2009 Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) {{is mainly}} caught off the South and Southwest coasts of Portugal, using two {{different}} types of gear, bottom trawling and creels. Trawling is the traditional fishing method, where Nephrops can be either a target species or by-catch of shrimp trawling. Creels are only used in areas unavailable to trawlers, either due to legislative restrictions on access or to unsuitable seabed. Creels have Nephrops as the only target species, but the fleet uses other gears to target other species. During the lasts decades, the modernisation of the trawling fleet with the resulting technological improvements, has lead to an increase in fishing effort. Nowadays, the two populations on the South and SW coast are considered outside biological safe limits, and a recovery plan is underway. Two typical vessels, in each fleet (trawling and creels), were selected to collect biological and economic data. Results show that the size composition of the catches is very different for the two gears used. Trawl catches are composed of small individuals usually in bad condition, while creel catches are composed of large and alive individuals (very high commercial value). It is assumed that the size composition obtained with creels results from the selectivity of the creel and the fact that these populations are exploited at much lower fishing levels. An assessment was made of the lobster fishery in order to evaluate its economic potencial. Results suggest that creels should be the only gear used, as it represents a very <b>selective</b> <b>gear</b> that could help the recovery of Nephrops stocks and allows a good economic return for the vessels involved. Thus, transference of fishing effort from trawling to creels is recommended...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} at twelve fish landing sites in Java and Kalimantan Islands, west central Indonesia, from June 2005 to October 2006 {{to overcome the}} lack of knowledge on chondrichthyan species in Indonesia. Data were collected for seven consecutive days at each site from fish landings, including species diversity, fisheries, utilizations, and biological data of chondrichthyan species. A total of 23, 454 individuals of chondrichthyans, 104 species and 28 families were recorded from 12 landing sites during the study, with an estimated total biomass of more than 70, 000 kg. This total consisted of 65 species of shark representing 16 families and 58 species of rays representing 11 families and a single species of holocephalan. Dasyatidae and Carcharhinidae were the most common families recorded. Dasyatis kuhlii (Dasyatidae) was the most abundant chondrichthyan species in this study, while Himantura gerrardi contributed most to the total biomass. Ordination of abundance values showed a segregation between the sites that had fishing grounds in shallow waters (the Java Sea, Karimata Strait) and sites that fished the deeper waters (the Indian Ocean, Makassar {{and a part of}} Sunda Strait). The shallower areas were typified by some common dasyatids and inshore sharks, and the deeper areas by large, oceanic and deep water chondrichthyans. The present study also identified which types of fishing gear contributed most to the total biomass and size of elasmobranch landings. A total of fifteen types of fishing gear are used from fishing vessels operating in the Java Sea and adjacent area (including Karimata Strait, Sunda Strait, Makassar Strait) and off south Java (the Indian Ocean) to catch chondrichthyan fishes, either as bycatch or as target of fishing. Set gillnet was the most common gear that caught chondrichthyan fishes, but Danish seine nets contributed most to both the total number and total biomass of chondrichthyan fishes captured in the observed area during the study. The Danish seine net (cantrang) was the least <b>selective</b> <b>gear</b> that caught elasmobranchs in Java and Kalimantan during the study, following by bottom lampara nets and set gillnets that were operated in inshore waters. Danish seine nets were also considered to contribute most to overall fishing pressure in the Java Sea. H. gerrardi contributed most to the total biomass of batoids captured in the Danish seine fishery from Batang landing site which is the largest contributor to the total catch of elasmobranchs in west central Indonesia. H. gerrardi is categorized as the “first class” {{and one of the most}} sought after rays in the skin industry at Batang due to the quality of its skin. Most elasmobranch products are utilized and marketed locally and some others are sold to large cities or other countries due to their high values, such as fins, gill rakers, skins and cartilage. The present study of chondrichthyan diversity in west central Indonesia also provides detailed data on the size composition and reproductive biology of some common elasmobranchs in the region. Size composition of each species varies among regions and fishing areas. Species that were caught in large numbers from heavily fished areas matured earlier than those from the lower fishing pressure areas. Precocious maturity of some dominant species may also indicate the high level of fishing pressure in the area where they are occurred. Diets of some common dasyatids caught from the Danish seine fishery operating in the Java Sea were also investigated to find out the contribution of stomach fullness to the size and weight relationships variation. More than 90 % of the diet of H. gerrardi was crustaceans, represented by carid shrimps, mantis shrimps and penaeids. Conversely, teleosts made significant contributions to the diet of H. jenkinsii and large size classes of H. uarnak and H. undulata...|$|E
40|$|Australian {{recreational}} and commercial fishers catch snapper (Pagrus auratus) from down to ∼ 120 m, often evoking barotrauma. Owing to minimum legal sizes and quotas or non-consumptive fishing practices, some afflicted fish are released, raising {{concerns over the}} potential for unaccounted fishing mortality. Two experiments were completed to quantify the (1) clinical signs of barotrauma among fish angled from 6 to 120 m (experiment 1) and (2) mortality (over 3 d) of fish with barotrauma that were released following either no treatment, venting (e. g. needle) or recompression (e. g. release weight) (experiment 2). In experiment 1, barotrauma was evident in some fish angled from 11 m and all from 3 ̆e 20 m. Fish were considered to have barotrauma {{if they had a}} prolapsed cloaca combined with a distended coelomic cavity and/or gastric herniation into the buccal cavity. Despite similar clinical signs among fish in experiment 2, none died, however, the associated trauma raises welfare concerns. Both recompression and venting offered benefits over no treatment by returning fish to depth quickly and releasing gases, respectively. Nevertheless, the release method should be dictated by the clinical signs of barotrauma and extrinsic conditions, including the competency of the fisher (e. g. for venting), presence of predators (e. g. for recompression), and exposure to sun or warm water (e. g. no treatment). More <b>selective</b> <b>gears,</b> spatial and temporal closures, or possibly replacing minimum legal sizes with quotas in deep water only could also reduce the frequency of barotrauma among released P. auratus and therefore, negative impacts on stocks...|$|R

50|$|With {{technical}} support from NOAA and IFREMER, the CRPMEMG carried out numerous at sea trials in close collaboration with French Guiana fleets. Specific parameters where tested {{such as the}} shape and spacing between {{the bars of the}} selective grid. These trials allowed the fleets and the crews on board the shrimp trawlers to understand the advantages of a more <b>selective</b> fishing <b>gear</b> and the benefits of using it in French Guiana. Based on the results and the captains’ recommendations, the CRPMEMG decided to make the use of this TTED system mandatory by January 2010, when the annual fishing licences are issued. Many Captains were already using the TTED device on their shrimp trawlers well before January 2010.|$|R
