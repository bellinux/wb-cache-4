They played to capacity houses and attracted generally good reviews, Leigh's health seemingly stable. John Gielgud directed Twelfth Night and wrote, [...] "...perhaps I will <b>still</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> good thing of that divine play, {{especially if he}} will let me pull her little ladyship (who is brainier than he but not a born actress) out of her timidity and safeness. He dares too confidently... but she hardly dares at all and is terrified of overreaching her technique and doing anything that she has not killed the spontaneity of by overpractice." [...] In 1955 Leigh starred in Anatole Litvak's film The Deep Blue Sea; co-star Kenneth More felt he had poor chemistry with Leigh during the filming.|$|E

500|$|The ZX80's design {{introduced}} many {{key features}} that were carried {{over to the}} ZX81; as Sinclair himself later said, [...] "the ZX80 {{was very much a}} stepping stone to the ZX81". The design was driven entirely by the desired price – the machine had to cost less than £100 but <b>still</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> healthy profit. Its distinctive wedge-shaped white case concealing the circuitry and the touch-sensitive membrane keyboard were the brainchild of Rick Dickinson, a young British industrial designer who had recently been hired by Sinclair. As he later recalled of Sinclair's approach, [...] "Everything was cost driven. The design was the face of the machine." [...] The unconventional keyboard was the outcome of Sinclair's cost-cutting. It made use of a sheet of plastic, on which the keys were printed, overlaying a metallic circuit that registered when a key was pressed. This avoided the expense of providing a typewriter-style keyboard, though the design had many drawbacks when it came to usability and [...] "feel".|$|E
500|$|Numerous reviewers {{commented on}} Morgan's writing and story. In The Seattle Times, {{journalist}} and science fiction author Nisi Shawl tied the writing {{quality to the}} action scenes, [...] "Morgan's talent for tension-building is matched by the clarity with which he describes the sideswiping, rubber-burning, rear-end-ramming, full-contact racing scenes. And both these skills are quietly eclipsed by his word-for-word writing ability. Apt metaphors and similes abound." [...] However, science fiction critic Robert K. J. Killheffer, in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, wrote [...] "it's not his best – it lacks the dense and evocative background of his Takeshi Kovacs books, and Morgan is not as sure-handed with near-future situations and characters – but it takes chances and largely succeeds." [...] Likewise, in the San Francisco Chronicle the reviewer wrote [...] "In its present form, the novel feels bloated and obvious, despite the sharpness of the descriptive writing {{and a couple of}} first-rate fight sequences. With the right artist, Market Forces might <b>still</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> compelling—and necessarily shorter—graphic novel." [...] The Library Journal review ended with a recommendation: [...] "Morgan's sf suspense belongs in most sf collections." [...] The reviewer in Booklist concluded [...] "It's not a particularly pleasant future, but Morgan paints it in broad strokes, drawing us into his future world and making it feel like a natural outgrowth of today's corporate chicanery. The novel might have been unremittingly bleak if it weren't for the moral center provided by Faulkner, who is a genuinely likable guy. Fans of Morgan's gritty, noirish brand of sf will ﬂock to this one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fuel for {{agricultural}} use often {{does not have}} fuel taxes (farmers get duty-free petrol or diesel fuel). [...] Biofuels may have subsidies [...] and low/no retail fuel taxes. Biofuels compete with retail gasoline and diesel prices which have substantial taxes included. [...] The net result {{is that it is}} possible for a farmer to use more than a gallon of fuel to make a gallon of biofuel and <b>still</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> profit. [...] Some argue that this is a bad distortion of the market. [...] There have been thousands of scholarly papers analyzing how much energy goes into making ethanol from corn and how that compares to the energy in the ethanol.|$|E

Generally older traditional ishiganto in Okinawa are place 20-30 centimeters off the ground. This is done to ward off evil spirits that enter the area by crawling on the ground. [...] Presently {{it is not uncommon}} to see an ishiganto embedded in the middle to upper part of a wall. [...] Kikai-jima (island) is known to have a triangular like font that is very comparable to a Japanese chess game called shogi. Today ishiganto are still being made and are in demand.

2500|$|Pet usage is {{the primary}} market for trapped painted turtles {{although}} a small number are sent to turtle races. Commercial trapping is modest economically, with double digits of trappers, selling a few thousand turtles yearly, at $1–2 per turtle. Individual harvesters who trap painted turtles typically do so for extra money and alternate between fishing and turtle trapping based on the markets. Many have been traditionally involved in the trade: Ben Hedstrom of Minnesota said, [...] "We've sold turtles for 50 years. My dad did it since the 1920s." [...] Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch. Rex Campbell of Minnesota said, [...] "I {{can go out and}} catch more turtles today than I did 10 years ago. I don't see that it's hurting the turtle population. The last thing I want to see {{is the end of the}} resource we've all depended on for a long time.

After the ceremony, Carolyn, still in pursuit, congratulates Cope. Cope leaves for Freeford without saying his goodbyes. A few weeks later, he sends Carolyn a perfunctory note reporting that he visited Arthur in Winnebago for a few days and has now taken a new position with [...] "an important university in the East."(307) The narrator interprets the note as evidence that Cope has his eye on the future and will travel East alone. Of Cope's attachment to Arthur, Randolph remarks to Joe: [...] "iking is the great mystery–whether you take its coming or its going."(309) He plans not to repeat his attempt to cultivate a young man in the coming academic year. Mrs. Phillips imagines Cope and Carolyn may <b>still</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> match. Randolph finds it equally plausible that Arthur will join Cope in the East.

The film underperformed {{at the box office}} upon its release. However, Chawla won much appreciation for her performance and her chemistry with Khan was also appreciated. A critic wrote [...] "Juhi Chawla is one of my favourite actresses and she is simply wonderful here. I’m not sure how she manages to keep a straight face through some of Shah Rukh’s more insane moments, but she plays Sonia as quite a serious career woman with a tendency to lecture in English. Although I do prefer her romance with Shah Rukh in Yes Boss they <b>still</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> sweet couple here." [...] The same year {{she appeared}} in Hrishikesh Mukherjee's swan song Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate alongside Anil Kapoor; her performance was appreciated by the audiences and critics alike. Rediff while reviewing the film wrote [...] "Only Juhi as the daughter is not based on any character from Hrishida's collection. She carries off her role with her inevitable chirpiness, and looks very good too. Hrishida was right when he told me that Juhi's serene face suited the kind of sacrifice she would make in the film. Only Jaya Bhaduri has managed that serenity in Hrishida's films." [...] However the film flopped at the box office. The same year she also appeared in Priyadarshan's rural drama Saat Rang Ke Sapne opposite Arvind Swamy. Though the film underperformed at the box-office, Chawla's portrayal of a gypsy met with immense critical appreciation. The same year she also appeared in the Malayalam detective comedy film Harikrishnans opposite Mammootty and Mohanlal. Her performance in the film was met with appreciation. The film received a great pre-release hype due to the combined screen presence of Mohanlal, Mammootty and Juhi Chawla. Harikrishnans {{turned out to be a}} blockbuster at the Kerala box-office, it was the highest grossing Malayalam film of 1998.|$|E
