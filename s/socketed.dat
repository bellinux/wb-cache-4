5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, <b>socketed,</b> and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|The stone {{bears no}} idiomatic Pictish symbols and, under J Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's {{classification}} system, it is a class III stone. Intact freestanding crosses {{of this age}} are comparatively rare, perhaps due to their vulnerability to damage, and {{the only ones in}} Eastern Scotland are the Camus Cross and the Dupplin Cross in Strathearn. Fragmentary remains of other crosses include heads found at Forteviot, St Vigeans and Strathmartine and shaft fragments found at Monifieth, Abernethy, Carpow and Invermay, as well as some <b>socketed</b> stones where crosses once stood.|$|E
50|$|The organic pin {{grid array}} was {{originally}} introduced for the AMD Athlon XP processors based on <b>Socket</b> A, also used for AMD processors using <b>Socket</b> 754, <b>Socket</b> 939, <b>Socket</b> 940, <b>Socket</b> FM1, <b>Socket</b> FM2, <b>Socket</b> AM2, <b>Socket</b> AM2+, <b>Socket</b> AM3, <b>Socket</b> AM3+ and <b>Socket</b> AM4.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Socket</b> 754 was the {{original}} <b>socket</b> for AMD's Athlon 64 desktop processors. Due {{to the introduction of}} newer <b>socket</b> layouts (i.e. <b>Socket</b> 939, <b>Socket</b> 940 and <b>Socket</b> AM2), <b>Socket</b> 754 became the more [...] "budget-minded" [...] <b>socket</b> for use with AMD Athlon 64 or Sempron processors. It differs from <b>Socket</b> 939 in several areas: ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>socket</b> was {{superseded}} by the LGA 1156 (<b>Socket</b> H) and LGA 1366 (<b>Socket</b> B) <b>sockets.</b>|$|R
5|$|Past {{hypotheses}} {{have suggested}} mistakenly that the Golondrina was a descendant or {{variant of the}} Plainview type. Although the two points exhibit similarities, particularly in terms of shape, they are now recognized as separate types. Identification is made {{from a lack of}} an auriculated, fishtail base on the Plainview and a deeper basal concavity on the Golondrina. Plainview points may have served to bring down large bison, while Golondrina points may have been used for killing smaller game such as deer, as well as doubling as a butchering knife. Compared to the split-stem hafting style of the Golondrina point without a deep setting, the shape of the Plainview points would necessitate them being set relatively deeply into a <b>socketed</b> haft that once bound would leave less of the cutting edge exposed. Stratigraphic evidence from the St. Mary's Hall site in southern, central Texas implies that Golondrina may have superseded Plainview on the southern Plains.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Plateosaurus {{is small and}} narrow, {{rectangular}} in side view, and nearly three times {{as long as it}} is high. There is an almost rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back. The large, round orbit (eye socket), the sub-triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris (nostril) are of almost equal size. The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, <b>socketed</b> teeth: 5 to 6 per premaxilla, 24 to 30 per maxilla, and 21 to 28 per dentary (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material. The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that Plateosaurus could deliver a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved sclerotic rings (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).|$|E
5|$|Umbrella: In all written records, {{the oldest}} {{reference}} to a collapsible umbrella dates to the year 21 AD, when Wang Mang (r. 9–23) had one designed for a ceremonial four-wheeled carriage. The 2nd-century commentator Fu Qian added that this collapsible umbrella of Wang Mang's carriage had bendable joints which enabled them to be extended or retracted. A 1st century collapsible umbrella has since been recovered from the tomb of Wang Guang at Lelang Commandery in the Korean Peninsula, illustrated in a work by Harada and Komai. However, the Chinese collapsible umbrella is perhaps a concept that is yet centuries older than Wang's tomb. Zhou Dynasty bronze castings of complex bronze <b>socketed</b> hinges with locking slides and bolts—which {{could have been used}} for parasols and umbrellas—were found in an archeological site of Luoyang, dated to the 6th century BC.|$|E
50|$|<b>Socket</b> C32 (LGA 1207 contacts) is {{the other}} member of the third {{generation}} of Opteron <b>sockets.</b> This <b>socket</b> is physically similar to <b>Socket</b> F but is not compatible with <b>Socket</b> F CPUs. <b>Socket</b> C32 uses DDR3 SDRAM and is keyed differently so as to prevent the insertion of <b>Socket</b> F CPUs that can use only DDR2 SDRAM. Like <b>Socket</b> G34, <b>Socket</b> C32 CPUs {{will be able to}} use unbuffered ECC or non-ECC RAM in addition to registered ECC SDRAM.|$|R
50|$|The AMD <b>Socket</b> C32 is {{the server}} {{processor}} <b>socket</b> for AMD's current single-CPU and dual-CPU Opteron 4000 series CPUs. It is {{the successor to}} <b>Socket</b> AM3 for single-CPU servers and the successor for <b>Socket</b> F for lower-end dual-CPU servers (High-end dual-CPU servers will use <b>Socket</b> G34). <b>Socket</b> C32 supports two DDR3 SDRAM channels. It {{is based on the}} <b>Socket</b> F and uses a similar 1207-land LGA <b>socket</b> but is not physically or electrically compatible with <b>Socket</b> F due to the use of DDR3 SDRAM instead of the DDR2 SDRAM that <b>Socket</b> F platforms use.|$|R
50|$|Communicating {{local and}} remote <b>sockets</b> are called <b>socket</b> pairs. Each <b>socket</b> pair is {{described}} by a unique 4-tuple consisting of source and destination IP addresses and port numbers, i.e. of local and remote <b>socket</b> addresses. As seen in the discussion above, in the TCP case, each unique <b>socket</b> pair 4-tuple is assigned a <b>socket</b> number, while in the UDP case, each unique local <b>socket</b> address is assigned a <b>socket</b> number.|$|R
25|$|Expansion ports {{are limited}} to a side {{expansion}} port and a trapdoor expansion {{on the underside of}} the machine. The casing can also be opened up (voiding the warranty), all larger chips are <b>socketed</b> rather than being TH/SMD soldered directly to the motherboard, so they can be replaced by hand.|$|E
25|$|With {{the switch}} to the Intel Core Solo and Duo line, Apple {{initially}} used a <b>socketed</b> CPU in the Mac Mini that allowed the processor to be replaced. They switched to a non-socketed CPU with the 2009 model that did not allow an easy upgrade. With the June 2010 revision, the case can be readily opened to add RAM (except for the Late 2014 models).|$|E
25|$|The valley has a {{long history}} of inhabitation, a <b>socketed</b> Bronze Age axe was found on Low Fell above Greenburn Beck in 1961 and remains of an Iron Age {{nucleated}} hillfort have been found at Castle Howe - a small mound of volcanic rock - including a hut circle and ditches cut into the rock. More recent research disagrees that it was ever a hillfort.|$|E
50|$|<b>Socket</b> 939 is a CPU <b>socket</b> {{released}} by AMD in June 2004 to supersede the previous <b>Socket</b> 754 for Athlon 64 processors. <b>Socket</b> 939 was succeeded by <b>Socket</b> AM2 in May 2006. It {{is the second}} <b>socket</b> designed for AMD's AMD64 range of processors.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Socket</b> FM2+ (FM2b) is a CPU <b>socket</b> used by AMD's desktop [...] "Kaveri" [...] APUs (Steamroller-based) and Godavari APUs (Steamroller-based) {{to connect}} to the motherboard. The FM2+ has a {{slightly}} different pin configuration to <b>Socket</b> FM2 with two additional pin <b>sockets.</b> <b>Socket</b> FM2+ APUs are not compatible with <b>Socket</b> FM2 motherboards due to the aforementioned additional pins. However, <b>socket</b> FM2 APUs such as [...] "Richland" [...] and [...] "Trinity" [...] are compatible with FM2+ <b>socket.</b>|$|R
50|$|Differences between <b>Socket</b> 5 and <b>Socket</b> 7 {{are that}} <b>Socket</b> 7 has an extra pin and is {{designed}} to provide dual split rail voltage, as opposed to <b>Socket</b> 5's single voltage. (However, not all motherboard manufacturers supported the dual voltage on their boards initially.) <b>Socket</b> 7 is backwards compatible; a <b>Socket</b> 5 CPU can be placed in a <b>Socket</b> 7 motherboard.|$|R
25|$|Arrowheads may be {{attached}} to the shaft with a cap, a <b>socketed</b> tang, or inserted into a split in the shaft and held by a process called hafting. Points attached with caps are simply slid snugly over the end of the shaft, or may be held on with hot glue. Split-shaft construction involves splitting the arrow shaft lengthwise, inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using a ferrule, sinew, or wire.|$|E
25|$|The pilum (plural pila) {{was a heavy}} javelin {{commonly}} used by the Roman army in ancient times. It was generally somewhat less than two metres long overall, consisting of a wooden shaft from which projected an iron shank about 7mm in diameter and 60cm long with a pyramidal head. The iron shank was <b>socketed</b> or, more usually, widened to a flat tang. A pilum usually weighed between two and four kilograms, with the versions produced during the empire era being somewhat lighter.|$|E
25|$|Excavations at {{the site}} have {{revealed}} many items from Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Romano-British periods. Most of the finds are now preserved at the Wiltshire Museum in Devizes. Most recently, Professor William Francis Grimes partially excavated the inner earthworks on the site in the 1950s. Finds included Iron Age pottery. In 1880 two Bronze Age axes were apparently found on or near Scratchbury Camp. Both are in private collection; one is a <b>socketed</b> type axe and the other resembles a late North European (Montelius 6) type.|$|E
50|$|<b>Socket</b> 754 is a CPU <b>socket</b> {{originally}} developed by AMD to supersede its Athlon XP platform (<b>socket</b> 462, {{also referred to}} as <b>Socket</b> A). <b>Socket</b> 754 was the first <b>socket</b> developed by AMD to support their new consumer version of the 64 bit microprocessor family known as AMD64.|$|R
50|$|<b>Socket</b> M is pin-compatible with desktop <b>socket</b> mPGA478A {{but it is}} not {{electrically}} compatible. <b>Socket</b> M is not pin-compatible {{with the}} older desktop <b>Socket</b> 478 (mPGA478B) or the newer mobile <b>Socket</b> P (mPGA478MN) by location of one pin; it is also incompatible with most versions of the older mobile <b>Socket</b> 479. Pentium III-M processors designed for the first version of <b>Socket</b> 479 will physically fit into a <b>Socket</b> M, but are electrically incompatible with it. Although conflicting information has been published, no 45 nm Penryn processors have been released for <b>Socket</b> M.|$|R
40|$|NOVELTY - The <b>socket</b> {{is formed}} from two half <b>sockets.</b> A half <b>socket</b> is provided, {{designed}} as {{the lower part}} of the <b>socket,</b> and a half <b>socket</b> (2) designed as the upper part of the <b>socket.</b> Each recess for leading empty pipes through the <b>socket</b> is formed by two half openings (4) located centrally opposite one another, one in the lower half <b>socket</b> and one in the upper half <b>socket.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A suitable hollow wall <b>socket</b> to connect with empty pipes for the construction of a pre-installation inside walls for the drawing-in of electrical conductors is described.

25|$|At Ciumeşti cemetery, of the 34 graves excavated, 21 {{were simple}} cremations in pits, seven {{featured}} inhumations, while {{the remains of}} six cremations had been buried in urns. The number and type of finds in the graves differed in each case. Principal among the grave-goods was an iron warrior's helmet of eastern Celtic type {{as well as a}} <b>socketed</b> spear, a pair of Hellenistic greaves and a suit of chain mail, to which a small bronze disc had been attached as its central feature with S-shaped motifs arranged in a series of symmetrical panels around its edge.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} Roman Empire, the Roman {{infantry}} came {{to use a}} differently-shaped javelin from the earlier pilum. This javelin was lighter and had a greater range. Called a plumbata, it resembled a thick stocky arrow, fletched with leather vanes to provide stability and rotation in flight (which increased accuracy). To overcome its comparatively small mass, the plumbata was fitted with an oval-shaped lead weight <b>socketed</b> around the shaft just forward {{of the center of}} balance, giving the weapon its name. Even so, plumbatae were much lighter than pila, and would not have had the armour penetration or shield transfixing capabilities of their earlier counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{surveys in}} Kausambi, 96km {{east of the}} Reh {{inscription}} showed that Kausambi had been completely destroyed at one point, and that the archaeological layer corresponding to the destruction contained numerous double-tanged and some triple-tanged arrows, consisting in an adaptation of Western <b>socketed</b> designs rather than Eastern designs, and previously associated with the Greeks in Taxila. These arrows can therefore {{be associated with the}} Indo-Greek invasion in the 2nd century BCE. Such arrowheads have also been found at Sonkh (near Borapa) and Mathura. The Manhai pillar capital, as well as fortification walls nearby Kausambi consisting of large blocks joined together with iron clamps and nails, a mode of construction unknown at the time in the Ganges valley, and thought to be the work of Greek craftsmen, also point to the presence of the Indo-Greeks.|$|E
5000|$|In IETF Request for Comments, Internet Standards, in many textbooks, {{as well as}} in this article, {{the term}} <b>socket</b> refers to an entity that is uniquely {{identified}} by the <b>socket</b> number. In other textbooks, the term <b>socket</b> refers to a local <b>socket</b> address, i.e. a [...] "combination of an IP address and a port number". In the original definition of <b>socket</b> given in RFC 147, as it was related to the ARPA network in 1971, [...] "the <b>socket</b> is specified as a 32 bit number with even <b>sockets</b> identifying receiving <b>sockets</b> and odd <b>sockets</b> identifying sending sockets." [...] Today, however, <b>socket</b> communications are bidirectional.|$|R
50|$|The Super <b>Socket</b> 7, also {{referred}} to as Super 7, is an extension of the <b>Socket</b> 7 ZIF <b>socket</b> specification. It features a 100 MHz front-side bus, support for AGP, and a SPGA package. Super <b>Socket</b> was used by AMD K6-2 and K6-III processors, some of the final Cyrix M-II processors, some of the final IDT WinChip 2 processors, and Rise mP6 processors. It is backward compatible with <b>Socket</b> 7, meaning a <b>Socket</b> 7 CPU can be used with a Super <b>Socket</b> 7 motherboard, but a Super <b>Socket</b> 7 CPU cannot operate at full speed in a <b>Socket</b> 7 motherboard. <b>Socket</b> 5 CPUs are pin-compatible with Super <b>Socket</b> 7, but not all motherboards designed for Super <b>Socket</b> 7 supported the voltages needed for <b>Socket</b> 5 CPUs.While AMD had previously always used Intel <b>sockets</b> for their processors, <b>Socket</b> 7 was the last one for which AMD retained legal rights. Intel had hoped by discontinuing <b>Socket</b> 7 development and moving to Slot 1 that AMD would be left with an outdated platform, making their processors non-competitive. By extending the FSB from 66 to 100 MHz, Super <b>Socket</b> 7 gave AMD the stopgap solution they needed while developing their own independent motherboard infrastructure, Slot A.|$|R
50|$|<b>Socket</b> 4, {{presented}} in 1993, {{was the first}} CPU <b>socket</b> designed for the early P5 Pentium microprocessors. <b>Socket</b> 4 was the only 5-volt <b>socket</b> for the Pentium. After <b>Socket</b> 4, Intel switched to the 3.3-volt-powered <b>Socket</b> 5. <b>Socket</b> 4 does support a special Pentium OverDrive, which allows running at 120 MHz (for the 60 MHz Pentium) or 133 MHz (for the 66 MHz Pentium).|$|R
25|$|Paleolithic {{implements}} {{were discovered}} within the Priory grounds. A Mesolithic quartzite pebble macehead {{was found in}} the same location. A Neolithic stone axe was retrieved from the River Stour; a polished flint axe in a gravel pit to the east and a flint head in a meadow just off the Ashen Road. A Neolithic flint arrowhead was found in a garden on Bridewell Street. A Neolithic long mortuary enclosure and three Bronze Age barrows were located across the river towards Ashen. Evidence of a barrow together with 200 worked flints were found near Chilton Street. A Bronze Age <b>socketed</b> gouge was unearthed from plough soil on the Common. There are some 24 other pre-Iron Age structures in the parishes around Clare which may be located via Google Maps.|$|E
25|$|Palomino was {{the first}} K7 core to include the full SSE {{instruction}} set from the Intel Pentium III, as well as AMD's 3DNow! Professional. It is roughly 10% faster than Thunderbird at the same clock speed, {{thanks in part to}} the new SIMD functionality and to several additional improvements. The core has enhancements to the K7's TLB architecture and added a hardware data prefetch mechanism to take better advantage of available memory bandwidth. Palomino was also the first <b>socketed</b> Athlon officially supporting dual processing, with chips certified for that purpose branded as the Athlon MP. According to articles posted on HardwareZone, it was possible to mod the Athlon XP to function as an MP by connecting some fuses on the OPGA, although results varied with the motherboard used.|$|E
25|$|Apple {{released}} the Macintosh Plus on January 10, 1986, {{for a price}} of US$2,600. It offered one megabyte of RAM, easily expandable to four megabytes {{by the use of}} <b>socketed</b> RAM boards. It also featured a SCSI parallel interface, allowing up to seven peripherals—such as hard drives and scanners—to be attached to the machine. Its floppy drive was increased to an 800kB capacity. The Mac Plus was an immediate success and remained in production, unchanged, until October 15, 1990; on sale for just over four years and ten months, it was the longest-lived Macintosh in Apple's history. In September 1986, Apple introduced the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, or MPW, an application that allowed software developers to create software for Macintosh on Macintosh, rather than cross compiling from a Lisa. In August 1987, Apple unveiled HyperCard and MultiFinder, which added cooperative multitasking to the Macintosh. Apple began bundling both with every Macintosh.|$|E
