40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2015 The project {{focused on}} {{creating}} {{a method of}} prevention for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in low-income hospitals. PPH a severe loss of blood after a woman gives birth and {{the leading cause of}} maternal mortality worldwide. In low and middle income countries, the shortage of skilled birth attendants means that maternal death due to PPH is especially common. Uterine atony is when the uterus does not contract after birth and is {{the most common cause of}} PPH. The current method for preventing PPH is called the Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL), which includes the administration of uterotonic drugs, placenta removal, and manual massage by a doctor, nurse, or midwife. The solution produced by this project is a mechanical massaging device that is meant for use when a medical professional is not available to perform the uterine massage. The design of the massaging device includes a housing, motor, turning plate, and silicone cover with a nylon insert. The silicone rests in direct contact with the patient’s skin and the turning plate applies pressure through the nylon, silicone, and skin and onto the smooth muscle of the uterus. The shear force felt by the uterus causes contraction and prevents PPH. The massaging device is held onto the patient using a vinyl <b>securing</b> <b>mechanism</b> which is weighted on each side. The weights keep the <b>securing</b> <b>mechanism</b> in place without requiring straps around the patient backs. The prototype of this device was successfully fabricated and tested during the course of this semester and proved to be effective, safe, and durable.

40|$|This work {{examines}} the measures adopted to curb user delinquency in academic libraries in Kaduna State. Survey research method {{was used for}} the study. The instrument used for investigation was questionnaire, which was administered to fifteen (15) academic libraries. The administration of the questionnaire was restricted {{to the head of the}} libraries under study. Also, interviews and personal observation were carried out on the same day the questionnaires were administered, and all the questionnaires administered were completed and collected back, giving a response rate of one hundred percent (100 %). The data collected was analyzed using descriptive statistics and percentage. Based on the result obtained, the following are the findings of the study. It was discovered that user orientation, surveillance within the library, formal user education and ensuring proper issuing of library materials ranked the highest, with a score of one hundred percent (100 %). This is followed by instruction against smoking in the library, which is eighty-seven percent (87 %), and surprise check in user hostels and lecturers’ offices, with a score of seventy-three percent (73 %). Finally, the least were informal user education and instruction against eating in the library, with the same score of sixty percent (60 %). The above are the application measures to curb delinquent acts that were identified in this study. The studies concludes that user delinquency in academic libraries in Kaduna State is a phenomenon that is likely to continue indefinitely, and that academic libraries must intensify their efforts and adopt more effective methods of arresting the ugly situation in libraries. Six (6) of the fifteen (15) academic libraries studied, indicated that all measures mentioned in the research were employed. The six (6) libraries which include: Federal College of Education, Zaria (FCE), Kashim Ibrahim Library, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria (KIL), Nigeria Defence Academy Library, Kaduna (NDA), Nigeria Institute of Transport Technology Library, Zaria (NITT), Samaru College of Agricultural Library, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.

Previous data aggregation schemes make sure that base stations do not receive and agree with the false aggregation values. The authentication mechanisms are used to detect malicious nodes. But these mechanisms may not be efficient and they can be easily bypassed by hacking the keys used for encryption. A <b>secure</b> <b>mechanism</b> for aggregating the data has been put forward in which the two stages of verification are performed.
