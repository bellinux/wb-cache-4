40|$|Black {{and white}} {{photograph}} of Rice University Owls football player Roger Roitsch, headlining his achievement into the Rice Athletic Hall of Fame. Caption reads: Entered Rice University {{in the fall}} of 1967 and graduated in 1971 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree to start an impressive career in the business world. In the regime of “Bo” Hagan as coach, Roitsch was first team All-SWC as a defensive lineman in both 1960 and 1970. He also was named to the CoSIDA Academic All-SWC team. And he wound up his grid career playing in the North-South All-Star Shriners Game at Miami. He received the Jess Neely Defense Award as the Owls’ top defensive player as voted by his teammates. Big Roger was 6 - 3 and 240 when he played for the Owls, and he was called “a great football player” by Coach Hagan in his senior campaign when he received considerable SWC recognition from the media. Roger played his high school ball at LaGrange for Coach Jesse Rowland while making All-Centex and playing in the Texas High School All-Star game. He also played in the <b>summer</b> <b>Oil</b> Bowl all-star game. Roger Roitsch personifies the type of person Rice University enjoys to welcome into its Hall of Fame, a man who was a splendid athlete, an able student, and a success in business after graduation who still maintains a close interest in his alma mater and supports the program and his community with volunteer work. He is now a Houstonian, but the roots are deep in LaGrange and he is proud of his old hometown … and now the old hometown can be proud of him!Rice Athletic Hall of Fam...|$|E

Here. we review the results obtained by a detailed analysis applied to the data recorded from February 1996 up to December 2004. At first, the daytime and nighttime data were extracted and then. in the daytime data. the data collected in winter were separated from those collected ill <b>summer.</b> <b>Oil</b> the second step the wavelet transform was applied. The results of this analysis are radio anomalies detected as earthquake precursors both for MCO and CZE data. In particular. regarding the MCO data. the main result was {{the appearance of a}} very clear anomaly during May-August 1998, at daytime and at nighttime. Such ail anomaly can be considered as a precursor of a seismic sequence started on August 15, 1998 with 17 earthquakes (M= 2. 2 - 4. 6) on the Reatini mountains, a seismogenic zone located 30 kill far from the AS receiver along the path MCO-AS. As concerns with the CZE data. the first result was obtained from the summer daytime data and it was the appearance of a very clear anomaly during August-September 1997, that call be considered a precursor of the two earthquakes with magnitude M= 5. 6 and M= 5. 9 that occurred on September 26 in the Umbria-Marche region (Central Italy). The second result was the appearance of an anomaly during February-March 1998, at daytime and at nighttime, that can be related to the preparatory phase of the strong (M= 5. 1 - 6. 0) Slovenia seismic sequence that occurred in a zone lying {{in the middle of the}} CZE-AS path...|$|E
40|$|Water {{deficiency}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious problems that faces the world particularly in the arid and semi arid regions. In Egypt, the governmental striving to increase water resources take three main managements, namely, development of upper river Nile projects, improvement of current water distribution system and re-use of water including domestic sewage effluents. The last direction frames the most appreciable and self-controllable resource so far despite many obstacles and limitations to be retrieved. In the present work two field trials were conducted in a sandy soil in Upper Egypt (Luxor) to investigate the use of treated domestic sewage effluents or freshwater (canal from river Nile) as control for growing six <b>summer</b> <b>oil</b> crops i. e, sunflower, peanut, soybean, castor bean,sesame and cotton. The pertinence of reusing biologically treated domestic sewage effluents in farming practices were assessed in terms of both parasitic load and potential toxic elements inside. Results exhibited that all tested growth characters and yield components for tested plants irrigated with biologically treated sewage effluents far exceeded those for plants irrigated with freshwater. Plants irrigated with sewage water produced more oil yield than control by 206. 6, 319. 4, 28. 8, 90. 5, 371. 5 and 16. 2 Kg/feddan for castor bean, sunflower, soybean, sesame, peanut and cotton, respectively. The content of potential toxic elements in seeds and oil grown in plots irrigated with exclusive treated domestic sewage effluents were almost more or less the same as those met in harvests irrigated with freshwater. It is worthy to mention that the oil produced from previous crops(in most cases) are used in industrial purposes such as manufacturing of printer ink, nylon, soaps,, papers, textile,leather,waxes,varnishes, lacquers, paints, various glues, plastics and synthetic materials as well. Therefore, treated domestic sewage effluents, especially if separated away from industrial wastes, could be used to growing oil crops for manufacturing purposes in arid and semi arid land...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effect of insecticides on the egg and adult stages of Sitona discoideus (Gyllenhal), and its natural enemy Microctonus aethiopoides (Loan). A range of insecticides were applied to S. discoideus eggs {{with the aim of}} assessing the ovicidal properties of the insecticides and to provide additional control to that already achieved against the adult weevil. The Potter tower direct spraying method was used to apply the insecticide at near field rates. Chlorpyrifos and fenitrothion exhibited the greatest activity followed by deltamethrin, diflubenzuron and ɤ -HCH. <b>Summer</b> <b>oil</b> and fenvalerate were ineffective as ovicides. Following treatment, chilling of eggs for 30 days below the threshold temperature for development, reduced the ovicidal activity of both chlorpyrifos and fenitrothion with the former showing an increase in LC₅₀ and change in the log dose-probit slope, while the latter produced a shift in LC₅₀ only. The effect of chlorpyrifos and fenitrothion on the parasitoid M. aethiopoides (Loan) was investigated and compared to its host S. discoideus. Topical dosing with chlorpyrifos and fenitrothion showed that the parasitoid was more susceptible than the weevil. The selectivity ratio of LD₅₀ parasitoid/LD₅₀ weevil confirmed that both insecticides were selective towards the parasitoid, with fenitrothion relatively more selective than chlorpyrifos. Fenitrothion was more toxic to aestivating than reproductive weevils, although the slopes of the log probit-dose line were similar. Possible reasons for the susceptibility of aestivating weevils relate to biochemical and physiological changes associated with aestivation, including greater sensitivity of cholinesterase or lack of food in the gut predisposing the weevil to the insecticide. The tolerance of the pupal stage of M. aethiopoides to both chlorpyrifos and fenitrothion was demonstrated using the Potter tower and topical application. Direct application using the Potter tower, with concentrations in excess of field rate did not affect pupal survival. However, longevity and the ability to parasitise weevil hosts were impaired in females surviving chlorpyrifos at 2. 4 g/l. The effect of chlorpyrifos on parasitoid longevity was greater in males. The high tolerance displayed by the pupae was repeated when cocoons were topically dosed with methylethyl-ketone solutions of chlorpyrifos and fenitrothion. An LD₅₀ for pupae could not be determined for either insecticide at the range of concentrations tested. A field experiment investigated the impact of chlorpyrifos applied at 0. 3 kg a. i. /ha on M. aethiopoides. Application in mid-May 1988 resulted in a 96. 2 % control of the weevil population leaving a post-spray density of 0. 8 weevils m⁻². The parasitoids occurring as larvae inside the weevil were particularly susceptible to the insecticide at this time. Surviving weevils were 87. 5 % parasitised, and it is speculated that the resulting parasitoids would form the nucleus, albeit at low density, to attack any surviving weevils in the following spring. In conjunction with the field study, laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the toxicity of field weathered chlorpyrifos residues on both the adult parasitoid and weevil. At 0. 3 kg/ha, chlorpyrifos residues caused over 60 % mortality of M. aethiopoides for three days after spraying, but activity declined rapidly thereafter. A more prolonged level of activity was recorded against S. discoideus, with c. 60 % mortality one day following application declining slowly through to fifteen days post-spray. Chlorpyrifos at 1. 0 kg/ha produced between 78 - 100 % mortality in both weevil and parasitoid for ten days following application. Twenty-two days after spraying, mortality the 1. 0 kg/ha rate still remained at ≥ 40 % for both insects. There appeared to be no obvious interaction between weevil mortality and the presence of larval parasitoids. However 4 th instar larva emerged and successfully pupated from dead weevils up to 24 hours after weevil mortality had been noted. Based on the field experiment, timing of insecticide application is important for the survival of the parasitoid. Delaying application till June as opposed to May, would allow a portion of the parasitoid population to move from the vulnerable larval stage to the highly tolerant pupal stage. This would provide a nucleus of parasitoids to attack surviving weevils in spring. However, despite virtual elimination of the parasitoid when lucerne is treated in mid-May, the management practice of applying a single spray in autumn combined with the limited areas being treated, ensures that reservoirs are maintained outside sprayed paddocks. The parasitoid is then reintroduced in the following autumn during the post-aestivatory reinfestation flights by the weevil...|$|E

40|$|The report, Biomass as Feedstock for a Bioenergy and Bioproducts Industry: The Technical Feasibility of a Billion-Ton Annual Supply (generally {{referred}} to as the Billion-Ton Study or 2005 BTS), was an estimate of 'potential' biomass based on numerous assumptions about current and future inventory, production capacity, availability, and technology. The analysis was made to determine if conterminous U. S. agriculture and forestry resources had the capability to produce at least one billion dry tons of sustainable biomass annually to displace 30 % or more of the nation's present petroleum consumption. An effort was made to use conservative estimates to assure confidence in having sufficient supply to reach the goal. The potential biomass was projected to be reasonably available around mid-century when large-scale biorefineries are likely to exist. The study emphasized primary sources of forest- and agriculture-derived biomass, such as logging residues, fuel treatment thinnings, crop residues, and perennially grown grasses and trees. These primary sources have the greatest potential to supply large, reliable, and sustainable quantities of biomass. While the primary sources were emphasized, estimates of secondary residue and tertiary waste resources of biomass were also provided. The original Billion-Ton Resource Assessment, published in 2005, was divided into two parts-forest-derived resources and agriculture-derived resources. The forest resources included residues produced during the harvesting of merchantable timber, forest residues, and small-diameter trees that could become available through initiatives to reduce fire hazards and improve forest health; forest residues from land conversion; fuelwood extracted from forests; residues generated at primary forest product processing mills; and urban wood wastes, municipal solid wastes (MSW), and construction and demolition (C&D) debris. For these forest resources, only residues, wastes, and small-diameter trees were considered. The 2005 BTS did not attempt to include any wood that would normally be used for higher-valued products (e. g., pulpwood) that could potentially shift to bioenergy applications. This would have required a separate economic analysis, which {{was not part of the}} 2005 BTS. The agriculture resources in the 2005 BTS included grains used for biofuels production; crop residues derived primarily from corn, wheat, and small grains; and animal manures and other residues. The cropland resource analysis also included estimates of perennial energy crops (e. g., herbaceous grasses, such as switchgrass, woody crops like hybrid poplar, as well as willow grown under short rotations and more intensive management than conventional plantation forests). Woody crops were included under cropland resources because it was assumed that they would be grown on a combination of cropland and pasture rather than forestland. In the 2005 BTS, current resource availability was estimated at 278 million dry tons annually from forestlands and slightly more than 194 million dry tons annually from croplands. These annual quantities increase to about 370 million dry tons from forestlands and to nearly 1 billion dry tons from croplands under scenario conditions of high-yield growth and large-scale plantings of perennial grasses and woody tree crops. This high-yield scenario reflects a mid-century timescale ({approx} 2040 - 2050). Under conditions of lower-yield growth, estimated resource potential was projected to be about 320 and 580 million dry tons for forest and cropland biomass, respectively. As noted earlier, the 2005 BTS emphasized the primary resources (agricultural and forestry residues and energy crops) because they represent nearly 80 % of the long-term resource potential. Since publication of the BTS in April 2005, there have been some rather dramatic changes in energy markets. In fact, just prior to the actual publication of the BTS, world oil prices started to increase as a result of a burgeoning worldwide demand and concerns about long-term supplies. By the end of the <b>summer,</b> <b>oil</b> prices topped $ 70 per barrel (bbl) and catastrophic hurricanes in the Gulf Coast shut down a significant fraction of U. S. refinery capacity. The following year, oil approached $ 80 per bbl due to supply concerns, as well as continued political tensions in the Middle East. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) was enacted in December of that year. By the end of December 2007, oil prices surpassed $ 100 per bbl for the first time, and by mid-summer 2008, prices approached $ 150 per bbl because of supply concerns, speculation, and weakness of the U. S. dollar. As fast as they skyrocketed, oil prices fell, and by the end of 2008, oil prices dropped below $ 50 per bbl, falling even more a month later due to the global economic recession. In 2009 and 2010, oil prices began to increase again as a result of a weak U. S. dollar and the rebounding of world economies...|$|E

Virus symptoms were various, depending on varieties, environ­men­tal factors, viruses and strains. Out of the viruses investigated only three [Cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV) (DTL serotype); Zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus (ZYMV) and Watermelon mosaic 2 potyvirus (WMV- 2) ] have been occurred on cucumber samples. Biological tests confirm­ed the results of DAS-ELISA. There was much difference, regarding the frequency of viruses. ZYMV was dominant in 1998, while CMV was dominant in 1999. The proportion of the complex infection was very high. Till now, besides CMV other viruses cannot be detected from weeds in cucumber ecosystems. The peak of aphid flight {{was in the middle of}} June and later a secondary peak was observed at the beginning of July, which coincided with the appearance of the first virus symptoms.
