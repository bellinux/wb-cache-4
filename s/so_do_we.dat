Some of the brain teasers feel a bit {{recycled}} - instead of foxes and chickens, you're shuttling dogs and cats across the river, for example - but there's more than enough variety to warrant doggedly tracking down every last one. But if you only solve the ones you need to move the story forward, that's ok, too." [...] The Guardian gave it four stars out of five, saying, [...] "If you've not {{been a fan of}} the series, this isn't the game that's going to change your mind. For everybody else though, Professor Layton & The Spectre's Call is several days of commute-improving, grey cell stimulation in a mostly effective package. [...] And bravo to Nintendo for keeping this franchise on the standard DS rather than – for the time being, at least – adding that third dimension." [...] However, The Daily Telegraph gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "The Layton charm is undoubtedly still present, but it's not enough to carry the series by itself. Upon solving certain puzzles, Layton exclaims 'I love the thrill of a good solution'. <b>So</b> <b>do</b> <b>we,</b> Hershel, <b>so</b> <b>do</b> <b>we.</b> And in this Layton game, sadly, that thrill is all too rare." ...|$|E

[...] Ed Easton Jr. of radio station WNOW-FM noted the song's {{similarities}} to Brown's 2008 single [...] "Forever" [...] (2008), writing that [...] "it has that fun and simple lyrical flow and puts more emphasis on the intoxicating beat." [...] He also called the song [...] "a beat banging dance track" [...] that would keep Brown rising back to the top. Megan Vick of Billboard magazine added that [...] "Brown's career has {{had its share of}} twists and turns, but 'Yeah 3x' proves he can still turn out a speaker-bumping track."

500|$|Critics {{disagreed}} {{about how}} successful {{the film was}} in capturing the novel's ambiguity, {{which is part of}} the enduring appeal of James's story. For Tim Dowling, a columnist for The Guardian, the film failed in this regard. The novella, Dowling explained, can be understood as a straightforward ghost story, but it can also be understood as a story about Ann's madness, and there is further ambiguity concerning whether the children are being controlled by Quint and Jessel, or whether the children are controlling Ann. He suggested that [...] "there's probably a subtlety to all this ambiguity on the page which, when translated to the screen, just looks like having it both ways." [...] As a result, [...] "the narrative was at times more evasive than ambiguous". Whittaker felt that the film failed to appropriately present the novella's ambiguity and implicit themes, saying that the adaptation [...] "feels oddly obligated to fill in all those blanks, and it's really the script's fault". Sutcliffe expressed a similar view; for example, he noted that [...] "when the governess sees Quint on the tower for the first time <b>so</b> <b>do</b> <b>we,</b> and the thing that really haunts us as we read the story—uncertainty—vanishes to be replaced by a much duller kind of fretfulness, about when something is next going to pop out at us." [...] By contrast, Chater and Teeman (both writing for The Times) felt the ambiguity of the film was praiseworthy, with Chater asking whether the ghosts truly exist or are just a manifestation of [...] "hysterical imagination", and Teeman suggesting that viewers will be more likely to believe (with Dr Fisher) that Ann's retelling is accurate. The Scotsmans Whitelaw praised Welch's ability to balance the various subtexts of the film while still delivering an effective narrative.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the root}} in other verses carries {{a sense of}} [...] "trial" [...] as simply a kind of test of a person's {{commitment}} to their faith (without necessarily implying that the testing results from something bad happening, as the sense of trial as [...] "tribulation" [...] might bear).

2500|$|However, Andy Gill from The Independent {{awarded the}} album two stars. He criticised Minogue's lack of {{creative}} delivery, by stating [...] "But they’re let {{down by the}} lack of character in Kylie’s delivery, most notably on “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town”, a posthumous duet with Frank Sinatra, where his easy, relaxed manner is in sharp contrast to her discomfort." [...] He commended the musical diversity of the tracks, highlighting [...] "Let It Snow", [...] "Winter Wonderland", and [...] "Every Day's Like Christmas", and highlighted [...] "White December", [...] "Cried Out Christmas", and [...] "Christmas Wrapping" [...] as the best tracks. Lauren Murphy from The Irish Times argued the relevance of the album, by stating [...] "We’ve heard it all before, <b>so</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> really need another pop star doing another bog-standard Christmas album with a sprinkling of festive cheese? To be fair, Kylie Minogue is better placed than most to do such an album, given her longevity in the business." [...] Murphy concluded [...] "2,000 Miles {{is one of the few}} saving graces on yet another inessential album that will have no bearing on your enjoyment of the festive season whatsoever."
