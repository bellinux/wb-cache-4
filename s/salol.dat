40|$|The {{rotational}} {{dynamics of}} a stiff paramagnetic tracer dissolved in supercooled <b>SALOL</b> is investigated via {{electron spin resonance}} spectroscopy. The study shows that the molecular rotation follows different dynamical regimes as the temperature is lowered. In particular, on cooling through the critical temperature T(C) of the <b>SALOL</b> the coupling between rotational relaxation and viscosity weakens and enhanced rotational diffusion is observed. In this temperature interval, the relationship between rotational correlation times and viscosity is fairly well described by a power law tau alpha eta(xi) (Fractional Debye-Stokes-Einstein law).

Contrary to most of the previous picosecond dynamics studies performed by means of Raman line profile analysis, we have employed in this paper a novel approach that enables the extraction of valuable short-time dynamics information through spectra fitting in the frequency domain. As a result, strongly overlapping vibrational lines can be put in focus. The analysis has shown a systematic dependence of vibrational relaxation on the local environment around a <b>salol</b> molecule.

Similar conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of changes of the frequency modulation time τ ω upon confinement. The changes in second moments of vibrations as well as the observed blueshifts of the Raman peaks in confinement suggest the strengthening of repulsion between <b>salol</b> molecules in the restricted space.

40|$|Many {{molecular}} glass forming liquids show a {{shift of}} the glass transition T-g to lower temperatures when the liquid is confined into mesoporous host matrices. Two contrary explanations for this effect are given in literature: First, confinement induced acceleration {{of the dynamics of}} the molecules leads to an effective downshift of T-g increasing with decreasing pore size. Second, due to thermal mismatch between the liquid and the surrounding host matrix, negative pressure develops inside the pores with decreasing temperature, which also shifts T-g to lower temperatures. Here we present dynamic mechanical analysis measurements of the glass forming liquid <b>salol</b> in Vycor and Gelsil with pore sizes of d= 2. 6, 5. 0 and 7. 5 nm. The dynamic complex elastic susceptibility data can be consistently described with the assumption of two relaxation processes inside the pores: A surface induced slowed down relaxation due to interaction with rough pore interfaces and a second relaxation within the core of the pores. This core relaxation time is reduced with decreasing pore size d, leading to a downshift of T-g proportional to 1 /d in perfect agreement with recent differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. Thermal expansion measurements of empty and <b>salol</b> filled mesoporous samples revealed that the contribution of negative pressure to the downshift of T-g is small (< 30 %) and the main effect is due to the suppression of dynamically correlated regions of size xi when the pore size xi approaches...|$|E
