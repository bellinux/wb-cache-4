25|$|Fundamentally, WMA is a {{transform}} coder {{based on}} modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), somewhat similar to AAC, Cook and Vorbis. The bit stream of WMA {{is composed of}} <b>superframes,</b> each containing 1 or more frames of 2048 samples. If the bit reservoir is not used, a frame is equal to a superframe. Each frame contains a number of blocks, which are 128, 256, 512, 1024, or 2048 samples long after being transformed into the frequency domain via the MDCT. In the frequency domain, masking for the transformed samples is determined, and then used to requantize the samples. Finally, the floating point samples are decomposed into coefficient and exponent parts and independently huffman coded. Stereo information is typically mid/side coded. At low bit rates, line spectral pairs (typically less than 17kbit/s) and a form of noise coding (typically less than 33kbit/s) {{can also be used}} to improve quality.|$|E

3000|$|The central {{controller}} {{of the network}} called PAN coordinator can optionally bound its channel time by using a <b>superframe</b> structure (i.e., beacon-enabled PAN). A <b>superframe</b> starts with the transmission of a beacon frame. In a <b>superframe</b> enabled WPAN, the <b>superframe</b> can have an active and an inactive portion; the active portion is divided into 16 equally sized slots.

30|$|With this proposal, {{the notion}} of dynamic <b>superframe</b> size {{starting}} with a minimum value as identified in [1] is introduced. The increase in the <b>superframe</b> size is restricted by the maximum size of the <b>superframe.</b> There exist two different policies {{that could be used}} to manage CTAs according to devices' needs. The first is to start off with a maximum <b>superframe</b> length and try to manage the growing number of CTRq commands by proper allocation of CTAs. The second method is to have an initial small <b>superframe</b> length and adjust its length any time it is necessary. The <b>superframe</b> duration can be extracted from the ‘superframe duration field’ in the ‘piconet synchronization parameters’ (see Figure  4) that are broadcasted in the beacon.The size of the <b>superframe</b> is managed by the ref-MPNC which, based on the novel proposal, recomputes the new <b>superframe</b> size after each CTA request decision. In case of an accepted CTRq, the new allocated channel time size is added to the <b>superframe</b> size and this new size is broadcasted to the devices in the ‘superframe timing’ field in the piconet parameter change IE (Figure  4) in the beacon. In such cases, the waiting time to start a new <b>superframe</b> is avoided if the maximum <b>superframe</b> size is not reached. Thus, the QoS requirements for real-time traffic in IEEE 802.15. 5 can be much satisfied by minimizing the delay between two consecutive CTAs of the same device. Additionally, the <b>superframe</b> capacity is efficiently utilized especially when the network is not overloaded. Consequently, only a portion of the superfame size is used (instead of using its maximum size), thus avoiding the wastage of the <b>superframe</b> capacity.|$|R
50|$|Data {{transfers}} to the coordinator require a beacon synchronization phase, if applicable, followed by CSMA/CA transmission (by means of slots if <b>superframes</b> are in use); acknowledgment is optional. Data transfers from the coordinator usually follow device requests: if beacons are in use, these {{are used to}} signal requests; the coordinator acknowledges the request and then sends the data in packets which are acknowledged by the device. The same is done when <b>superframes</b> are not in use, only in this case there are no beacons {{to keep track of}} pending messages.|$|E
50|$|Within <b>superframes</b> {{contention}} occurs {{between their}} limits, and is resolved by CSMA/CA. Every transmission must end {{before the arrival}} of the second beacon. As mentioned before, applications with well-defined bandwidth needs can use up to seven domains of one or more contentionless guaranteed time slots, trailing {{at the end of the}} superframe. The first part of the superframe must be sufficient to give service to the network structure and its devices. <b>Superframes</b> are typically utilized within the context of low-latency devices, whose associations must be kept even if inactive for long periods of time.|$|E
50|$|The MAC {{layer is}} {{particularly}} relevant to W-USB. It uses <b>superframes</b> divided in 256 time slots, {{the first of}} which are dedicated to the transfer of beaconing information. Slots can further be allocated to meet the necessities of clusters of devices, also identified by MMC's (see below). A host maintains one or more W-USB communication channels and is fully aware of the MAC layer, whereas a device only needs to use the defined W-USB interface to communicate through existing channels.|$|E
30|$|The {{coordinator}} of the IEEE 802.15. 4 WPAN sets the <b>superframe</b> duration equal to the <b>superframe</b> duration of the ECMA- 368 WPAN. Therefore, the <b>superframe</b> periodicity {{is the same for}} both ECMA- 368 and IEEE 802.15. 4 WPANs.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{efficiently}} transport slowly varying channel associated signalling bits, second order structures known as multiframes or <b>superframes</b> are defined. For example, for E1 trunks the CAS signaling bits are updated once per multiframe of 16 frames (every 2 milliseconds) while for T1 ESF trunks the superframe is 24 frames (3 milliseconds). Other types of second order structures {{are also in}} common use. In GSM cellular networks, the Abis channel that connects the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and Base Station Controller (BSC) is an E1 link with several framing alternatives, {{all of which have}} a basic superframe duration of 20 milliseconds.|$|E

30|$|The “AND” {{function}} or {{the logical}} multiplication function {{is applied to}} evaluate whether the nodes are mutually exclusive on the slot sharing in different <b>superframes</b> with the same slot number. If the results of logical multiplication are all zero, it indicates that the nodes can share the same slot number in different <b>superframes</b> without collision. If there is “ 1 ” value in the logical multiplication sequence, it means the slots with the same number in different <b>superframes</b> are utilized and that different nodes cannot share the slot with same number. The “OR” function or logical addition function is employed to express whether they can provide available slots for extra nodes. The zero value in the result of “OR” function indicates that the slot in different <b>superframes</b> is unoccupied and can be assigned to other nodes for data transmission. If the results of logical multiplication are all “ 1 ”, the slots in different beacon periods are fully occupied in the highest utility that cannot support slot allocation to new admitted nodes. But there are other slots with different slot number that can be provided to the new admitted nodes.|$|E
40|$|International audience—A Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) {{provides}} {{health care}} services. The performance and utility of WBANs can be degraded due to interference. In this paper, our contribution for co-channel interference mitigation among coexisting WBANs is threefold. First, we propose a distributed orthogonal code allocation scheme, namely, OCAIM, where, each WBAN generates sensor interference lists (SILs), {{and then all}} sensors belonging to these lists are allocated orthogonal codes. Secondly, we propose a distributed time reference correlation scheme, namely, DTRC, that {{is used as a}} building block of OCAIM. DTRC enables each WBAN to generate a virtual time-based pattern to relate the different <b>superframes.</b> Accordingly, DTRC provides each WBAN with the knowledge about, 1) which <b>superframes</b> and, 2) which time-slots of those <b>superframes</b> interfere with the time-slots within its superframe. Thirdly, we further analyze the success and collision probabilities of frames transmissions when the number of coexisting WBANs grows. The simulation results demonstrate that OCAIM outperforms other competing schemes in terms of interference mitigation and power savings...|$|E
30|$|From Figs.  14 and 15, we {{have the}} {{following}} observations. Firstly, as expected, the PLR performances of both static and random methods do not change with {{the extension of the}} <b>superframe</b> length. Secondly, the performance of the perfect prediction method continuously improves with the extension of the <b>superframe</b> length. The reason may be the “bad” channel has a longer time to recover when a longer <b>superframe</b> length is adopted. Besides, since the perfect prediction scheme represents the upper bound performance of DSS methods, this observation also indicates that DSS methods have more potential when a longer <b>superframe</b> is adopted. Thirdly, the performance of DSS-TA slightly improves when the <b>superframe</b> length increases from 35 to 105 ms. Specifically, for the channel dataset CD 1, DSS-TA achieves the best PLR performance when the <b>superframe</b> length is 105 ms, which is about 10.9 % PLR reduction in comparison with the flipping method. Then, the further prolongation of <b>superframe</b> would undermine the effectiveness of DSS-TA. On the one hand, when the <b>superframe</b> is too short, there is not enough time to “revive” the bad channels, even the TAM model could provide an accurate PLR prediction. On the other hand, the channel autocorrelation decreases with the extension of the <b>superframe</b> length. Thus, the accuracy of PLR prediction results also decreases when a longer <b>superframe</b> is adopted, which decreases the performance of DSS-TA. At last, we found that when the <b>superframe</b> length is larger than 490 ms, the flipping and DSS-TA methods achieve the roughly same performance. Compared to the flipping method, the TAM used in the DSS-TA considers not only the latest channel gains but also the channel gains in the past 2 s. Therefore, this observation indicates that TAM may not provide further accuracy in terms of channel condition prediction when the target future time slot is far away. However, a <b>superframe</b> length longer than 490 ms is normally impractical for most WBAN applications, because even for non-medical applications, the packet latency should be less than 250 ms [43], which limits the <b>superframe</b> to at most 250 ms. Accordingly, except for the applications that are not constrained with respect to packet latency, the DSS-TA provides a more accurate estimation of future channel conditions and hence achieves a better transmission performance in terms of PLR.|$|R
