Objectives: Estabilishing the overview of the contemporary theoretical knowledge regarding the "Repetitive Strain Injury" while focusing on the "Text Message Injury". Evaluate the muscle fatigue appearance of the selected hand muscles while <b>sms</b> <b>texting</b> on the cell phone. Methods: The study was performed on a five healthy subjects. The muscle activity of the m. opponens pollicis, m. flexor carpi ulnaris and m. extensor carpi radialis was detected by the surface electromyography while performing three maximum isometrical contractions before and after finishing a task. The task of each subjekt was to type 10 defined sms messages, 160 characters each, on a defined cell phone in specified frequency. The median of {{the frequency of the}} EMG signal compared before and after the finishing of the defined task was set as the parameter for evaluating the muscle fatigue appearance. The percentual increase or decrease of the median of the frequency was estabilished as well as the change of the area under the curve of the total power spectrum of the EMG signal. Results: There was no muscle fatigue appearance detected in observed muscles while <b>sms</b> <b>texting</b> on the cell phone. But the results of the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{diachrony}} of the verbs of volition ai and beh in Southern Min (SM). The data include historical <b>SM</b> <b>texts</b> (16 th- 19 th century), folk {{songs in the}} late 19 th to early 20 th century, and contemporary natural Taiwanese Southern Min conversations. The results mainly mark two stages {{of the development of}} ai and beh: historical (before 1900) and contemporary SM. Since the 16 th century (Ming Dynasty), ai {{has been used as a}} verb of volition indicating love, intention or hope. As for historical ai, it marked future, specialized however for predicting an adverse future. In contemporary SM, a sense of necessity emerged with the use of ai denoting general agreement among people. Seven senses are attributed to historical beh: want/intention/hope, future, excessiveness, necessity, proximity and conditionality. In contemporary SM, the indication of the want of an entity has become a less preferred use, and necessity is only preserved when indicating puzzlement and helplessness. The diachronic developments of ai and beh demonstrate an interplay of metaphorization and metonymization (Traugott and Dasher 2002 : 27). Metaphorization contributes first to the semantic shift of ai and beh from “to want; to love” to “to intend to” and a concurrent categorical change from lexical verb into auxiliary, and second, to the evolution of future. Metonymization activates an even wider range of uses and meaning change, including the pragmatic strengthening of interpretations such as excessiveness (beh), necessity (ai, beh), proximity (beh) and conditional (beh), and prediction of an undesirable future (ai) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{composing}} and editing emails, <b>sms</b> <b>texts,</b> tweets, blogs and Facebook messages, rehearses the digital text in an often non-linear dance of ‘cut’, ‘paste’ and ‘delete’. Digital writing is inherently unfinished; {{it has no}} instantiation but exists only as pattern that can be reshaped and rewritten. Right up until the moment we press ‘send’. Sending cannot be undone; it ends the process and produces a final product for consumption. Pressing send instantiates the digital text, bringing it to completion and into the world. The act of sending performs the writing, transferring it from author to audience. This article explores digital writing as inherently ‘unfinished’, in constant flux and potentially disappearing. It exists this way until it is sent or posted as a message; the act of sending brings something into being that was not previously accessible, and this article will examine the explicit performativity of this act {{through the lens of}} Speech Act Theory. The act of pressing send is both performative and a performance. Unlike many performatives that can, as Eve Sedgewick explains, be undone or revoked (taking back a promise, having a marriage annulled) sending or posting text into the cyber-sphere is nigh impossible to erase. The act of sending also provides an example of the unification of user and machine, of fingertip and keyboard, and this article will further explore the ‘grafting’ (Anna Munster) of human and machine in the specific example of sending information, questioning where and when exactly the performance takes place. While {{this is an example of}} user-to-user interaction via media, with the interplay between user and machine typically involving command and response, the example of pressing send appears to complicate this simplicity; sending is accomplished collaboratively...|$|R

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1990 Dr. Ann Sweesun KohThis thesis is a description of some common linguistic features of Colloquial Malay, a spoken variety of the Malay language used by native Malay speakers of Malaysia among themselves in everyday unmarked speech situations. While linguistic works and grammars of Standard Malay (or, Bahasa Malaysia), the national language of Malaysia are numerous, {{there are very few}} works on the less formal varieties and dialects of Malay spoken in Malaysia. Little importance is given to studying Colloquial Malay and scholarly works on Colloquial Malay are very rare. This thesis seeks to explore and compare various formal properties of Colloquial Malay and Standard Malay and in doing so, to contribute to this largely unexplored area of study in the Malay language. In this work I aim to provide a description of some of the major characteristics of CM in contrast with SM based on a comparison of one sizeable CM text with a comparable <b>SM</b> narrative <b>text.</b> An inductive method is used in analysing inter-and intra-textual shifts in register, that is, shifts in the degree of formality or informality, which correlate with the use of CM-like properties and SM-like properties. From this I build up a description of a set of CM features which can be expected to be characteristic of actual colloquial Malay usage, which will provide a basis for further study. The types of CM features described are diverse and include lexical, morphological and syntactic properties. The lexical features examined include variant phonological forms, colloquial lexical roots, semantic shifts in the colloquial usage of some common roots, code-switching and English loans, the class of emotive, modal and illocutionary particles, and the classes of pronouns and prepositions in Colloquial Malay. Some typical Colloquial Malay expressions, phrases and constructions are dealt with briefly. Several grammatical features are considered: affixation and its frequency in Colloquial Malay relative to Standard Malay; ‘passive’ and causative constructions; the structure of the noun phrase; the Modifier-punya-Head construction, a typical Colloquial Malay construction; verbal auxiliaries; and typical uses of the adverbial saja/(a) je ‘only, just’ in Colloquial Malay. Clause combining strategies, which include subordination, coordination, verb serialization and juxtaposition, are discussed as well. Open Acces...|$|R

The EHR systems have high availability and security requirements for the storage database. DIGHT is a distributed key-value store architecture being developed at SICS addressing the problems of high availability and scalability, data integrity and confidentiality, accountability, EHR versioning and extensibility. This Master thesis addresses the authorization requirements of the EHR systems. eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) is a OASIS standard for general purpose access control policy language designed for managing the access for resources. All of the available open source implementation of Policy Decision Point(PDP) conforms to XACML version 2. 0 and retrieves the policies from the traditional file systems. Sun open source implementation of PDP conforming to XACML 2. 0 was evaluated. It was upgraded to conform with XACML 3. 0 standards. The XACML Admin Profile for delegation was also implemented. The testing was carried out with a prototype application which accepts <b>text</b> <b>sms</b> from registered doctors through an sms gateway. The application was designed for adding new patient record, medical record to an existing patient and retrieving existing patient and medical records.
