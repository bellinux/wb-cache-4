In the early afternoon hours of Tuesday, June 11, 2013, beginning before 2:00 p.m. MDT, reports of a wildfire in the Black Forest area reached 9-1-1 dispatchers. The initial 9-1-1 call came from Gregg Cawlfield, reporting a small structure fire. Cell phone video he captured shows the fire started as a small, localized event. The record heat and high winds quickly spread the flames to several hundred acres. As of June 20, the investigation into the cause and timeline of events continued.|$|E

From the results obtained, it is deduced that the <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> procees substantially modifies some of these parameters. In some cases the variations induced are independent of the <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> conditions, while others (fabric weight, crimp, flexmal rigidity, air permeability, crease recovery, drape breaking strength and abrasion resistence) {{are influenced by the}} temperature. <b>Heat</b> <b>setting</b> time influences to some extent the drape coefficient and abrasion resitance.

50|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>setting</b> is a {{term used}} in the textile {{industry}} to describe a thermal process taking place mostly in either a steam atmosphere or a dry heat environment. The effect of the process gives fibers, yarns or fabric dimensional stability and, very often, other desirable attributes like higher volume, wrinkle resistance or temperature resistance. Very often, <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> {{is also used to}} improve attributes for subsequent processes. Yarns tend to have increased torquing just after spinning, cabling or twisting. <b>Heat</b> <b>setting</b> can influence or even eliminate this tendency to undesirable torquing. At the winding, twisting, weaving, tufting and knitting processes, an increased tendency to torquing can cause difficulties in processing the yarn. When using <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> for carpet yarns, desirable results include not only the diminishing of torquing but also the stabilization or fixing of the fiber thread. Both twist stabilization and stabilization of frieze effect are results of the <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> process. <b>Heat</b> <b>setting</b> benefits staple yarns as well as bulked continuous filament (BCF) yarns. <b>Heat</b> <b>setting</b> often causes synthetic fibers to gain volume as well. This volume growth is commonly described as “bulk development”. All processes using temperature and/or moisture to give textiles one of the above-mentioned attributes are known as <b>heat</b> <b>setting.</b> The term “thermal fixation” is used less frequently. In the carpet industry, the process is exclusively called “heat setting”.|$|R

5000|$|Conventional {{payloads}} {{typically have}} a float duration at altitude of 72+ hours. Long Duration Ballooning payloads float at durations of 42+ days. Ultra long duration balloons (ULDB) {{are being developed}} which can operate at float for +100 days. The limiting factor is the diurnal cycle of the sun, rising and <b>setting.</b> <b>Heat</b> during the day causes the balloon to expand and gain altitude, thereby losing helium [...] Heat loss at night causes the balloon to sink and contract. Ballast is carried to overcome the effect. Flying in a polar region during full sunlight allows more negligible altitude variations. ULDB balloons are sealed to prevent helium loss, but further engineering is required to create a balloon system that can survive the greater pressures involved.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a numerical investigation carried out on an alternative jet fan, known in literature like Banana Jet, and it compares its fluid dynamic performances to traditional axial ventilation systems. The alternative jet fan is equipped with inlet/outlet sections inclined at a fixed pitch angle (a) toward the tunnel floor. This approach establishes an alternative solution that is able to provide a safety level equivalent to the traditional solution, in different scenarios. Both systems are installed in an oneway tunnel and two different scenarios (without vehicles and with traffic jam) are considered, in event of fire.

This literature review provides an overview of existing research findings about the effects of heat stress on the working population in relation to climate change.

The main factors found to exacerbate heat stress in the current and future workplace are the urban ‘heat island effect’, physical work, individual differences, and the developing country context where technological fixes are often not applicable. There is also a lack of information on the effects on vulnerable groups such as elderly people and pregnant women. As increasing temperatures reduce work productivity, world economic productivity could be condensed, affecting developing countries in the tropical climate zone disproportionately.

40|$|Abstract—A {{heat pump}} system {{has been used in}} this study to replace a natural gas boiler for the supply of hot water in a medium size {{hospital}} in central Taiwan. The pump capacity is 140 kW. Heat is absorbed from the ice water at 12 ℃ of an air conditioning system with a capacity of 90 kW, and then used to heat up tap water at room temperature. The system has been running for seven months. It shows that the system can fully satisfy the hot water requirement of the hospital. The outlet water temperature is 48 ~ 51 ℃, and the maximum rate is 75 tons per day. According to the running record, energy cost has been reduced by US$ 90000 in the past seven months, and the reduction in carbon dioxide emission has been cut 256 tons.

40|$|A {{review of}} Archean granite-greenstone terranes, orogenic gold deposits, the Slave Province and modern {{exploration}} tools, techniques and methods {{was conducted to}} identify prospective areas in the Yellowknife domain for hosting orogenic gold deposits and illustrate the best exploration methods for delineating this deposit type. This study identifies Archean granite-greenstone terranes as economically important hosts to quartz-carbonate vein-hosted orogenic gold deposits. These deposits occur at convergent plate margins, but can also be related to local extensional tectonics within a convergent <b>setting.</b> <b>Heat</b> generated from tectonic processes can trigger hydrothermal fluid movement along first-order faults and shear zones. Precipitation of gold-bearing quartz-carbonate veins from the hydrothermal fluids occurs in second- and third-order faults and shear zones related to the first-order structures. This study also identifies the Archean Slave Province in northern Canada as a well-endowed craton with numerous orogenic gold deposits, diamondiferous kimberlites, VMS deposits and several other mineralization styles. In particular, three greenstone belts (Yellowknife, Cameron River and Beaulieu River) associated with likely first-order structures are comprised of prospective rocks for hosting orogenic gold and VMS mineralization. The Yellowknife greenstone belt hosts the past-producing and former world-class Con and Giant orogenic gold deposits, but has been little explored with modern exploration techniques. The Cameron River and Beaulieu River greenstone belts host numerous base and precious metal VMS and BIF-hosted orogenic gold prospects and deposits, indicating mineralization is present. There is considerable potential for significant discoveries to be made using modern exploration techniques in the greenstone belts; however, exploration in the region has been hindered {{over the past decade}} by ongoing political negotiations. Once the political negotiations are finalized, application of modern exploration methods and techniques in the prospective greenstone belts should be carried out. Regional scale methodologies should be applied to generate targets using predictive modelling, implicit 3 D modelling, 3 D geochemistry and exploration targeting so decisions defining a businesses strategy for ground acquisition of high priority targets are made using quantitative analysis. Once ground is acquired, field-based exploration for orogenic gold and VMS deposits should include geological mapping with a focus on structural geology, geochemical sampling and airborne magnetic, radiometric and EM geophysical surveys. Prior to reconnaissance drilling, integration of all data layers and interpretation within a common 3 D earth model should be conducted. Following successful reconnaissance drilling, definition drilling along strike and down dip of intersected mineralization, combined with borehole geophysics, should be carried out to delineate the extent of mineralization...|$|E
