5|$|As they <b>share</b> <b>many</b> {{cross-platform}} {{games and}} {{compete for the}} same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce, and analysts expect that a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.|$|E
5|$|Biogeography (an {{amalgamation}} {{of biology}} and geography) is the {{comparative study of}} the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time. The Journal of Biogeography was established in 1974. Biogeography and ecology <b>share</b> <b>many</b> of their disciplinary roots. For example, the theory of island biogeography, published by the Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in 1967 {{is considered one of}} the fundamentals of ecological theory.|$|E
5|$|Female {{marsupials}} have paired uteri and cervices. Most eutherian (placental) mammal {{species have}} a single cervix and single, bipartite or bicornuate uterus. Lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents <b>share</b> <b>many</b> morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade Glires. Anteaters of the family myrmecophagidae are unusual in that they lack a defined cervix; they {{are thought to have}} lost the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix on more than one lineage.|$|E

However, the show drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 27.5% of households watching over a 43 <b>share.</b> <b>Many</b> media outlets {{pointed out that the}} broadcast earned higher ratings compared to the final game of the 1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament which was airing on CBS that same night.|$|E
5|$|There are few data on comorbid {{conditions}}, {{but there}} are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which RAD arises, such as institutionalization or maltreatment. These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect. Conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and social phobia <b>share</b> <b>many</b> symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD. Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors.|$|E

5|$|Babakotia radofilai and {{all other}} sloth lemurs <b>share</b> <b>many</b> traits with living sloths, demonstrating {{convergent}} evolution. It had long forearms, curved digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily built than that of indriids, {{but not as much}} as in the larger sloth lemurs. Its dentition is similar to that of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other sloth lemur species, Palaeopropithecus ingens and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion. Babakotia radofilai was primarily a leaf-eater (folivore), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from subfossil remains and may have died out shortly after the arrival of humans on the island, but not enough radiocarbon dating has been done with this species to know for certain.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria's {{relations}} with the Russian Federation are currently on a good or fair level. Both countries have had centuries-long interactions, sharing a common heritage. The Cyrillic alphabet originated during 9th century and it was created by Clement and Naum, who were the students of Cyril and Methodius, which later accepted the Orthodox Slavic countries as their standard letter. Relations between Russia and Bulgaria have dated {{back as far as}} the 19th century. Both nations had the tradition of calling monarchs tsars, a Slavic word for caesar or emperor. The Russian Empire was the first country to recognize Bulgaria, and greatly helped Bulgaria in its war of independence from Ottoman Empire in 1908. During the Cold War, Bulgaria became an ally of the Soviet Union as a satellite state. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations between Bulgaria and Russia still <b>share</b> <b>many</b> different opinions, such as the two World Wars when Bulgaria both joined German side against Russia, and the problem over the history.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurids <b>share</b> <b>many</b> {{features}} {{with early}} birds (clade Avialae or Aves). The precise {{nature of their}} relationship to birds has undergone {{a great deal of}} study, and hypotheses about that relationship have changed as large amounts of new evidence became available. As late as 2001, Mark Norell and colleagues analyzed a large survey of coelurosaur fossils and produced the tentative result that dromaeosaurids were most closely related to birds, with troodontids as a more distant outgroup. They even suggested that Dromaeosauridae could be paraphyletic relative to Avialae. In 2002, Hwang and colleagues utilized the work of Norell et al., including new characters and better fossil evidence, to determine that birds (avialans) were better thought of as cousins to the dromaeosaurids and troodontids. A consensus of paleontologists has concluded that there is not yet enough evidence to determine whether any dromaeosaurids could fly or glide, or whether they evolved from ancestors that could.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses <b>share</b> <b>many</b> {{morphological}} and biological characteristics. Many species of mammals are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that ASL is a creole with LSF as the superstrate language and with the native village sign languages as substrate languages. However, more recent {{research has shown that}} modern ASL does not <b>share</b> <b>many</b> of the structural features that characterize creole languages. ASL may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time, but {{it is also possible that}} it was never a creole-type language. There are modality-specific reasons that sign languages tend towards agglutination, for example the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. This might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology. Additionally, Clerc and Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true LSF.|$|E
5|$|The bee-eaters are morphologically {{a fairly}} uniform group. They <b>share</b> <b>many</b> {{features}} with related Coraciiformes {{such as the}} kingfishers and rollers, being large-headed (although less so than their relatives), short-necked, brightly plumaged and short-legged. Their wings may be rounded or pointed, with the wing shape closely correlated with the species' preferred foraging habitat and migratory tendencies. Shorter, rounder wings are found on species that are sedentary and make typically short foraging flights in denser forests and reed-beds. Those with more elongated wings are more migratory. All the bee-eaters are highly aerial; they take off strongly from perches, fly directly without undulations, {{and are able to}} change direction quickly, although they rarely hover.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{complexities of}} RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia <b>share</b> <b>many</b> symptoms {{and are often}} comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children {{are likely to be}} of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans were}} agreed upon in 1956, and {{building}} started on 5 June that year, when {{the chairman of}} the city's sports committee turned the first sod. The ground officially opened about two years later, on 28 May 1958. At the time of the stadium's inauguration, it held 31,000 spectators. It was designed by architects Sten Samuelsson and Fritz Jaenecke, who also designed another of the World Cup stadiums, Ullevi in the city of Gothenburg; as a result, the two grounds <b>share</b> <b>many</b> architectural features. During the World Cup, the stadium hosted three matches: West Germany vs Argentina in Group 1, which was the inaugural match of the stadium; West Germany vs Northern Ireland, also in Group 1; Northern Ireland vs Czechoslovakia, in the Group 1 play-off; and, finally, West Germany vs Yugoslavia in the quarter-final round.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} {{portion of}} the game divides the campaign map among twenty factions from the period, {{with a total of}} twelve being playable. The initial extent of each major faction's territory, and the factions available, depends on the starting period of the game, Early (1087), High (1205) or Late (1321), reflecting the historical state of these factions over time. The factions themselves represent many of the major nations at the time, including the Byzantine Empire, France, England, the Holy Roman Empire and the Turks. Several factions, such as the Golden Horde, emerge during the course of play at their historical time. These factions, together with several other factions appearing {{at the start of the}} campaign, are unavailable to the player in the main campaign. Each faction varies in territory, religion and units; however, factions of the same culture <b>share</b> <b>many</b> of their core units.|$|E

5|$|Yoga and Vedanta are the {{two largest}} {{surviving}} schools of Hindu traditions. They <b>share</b> <b>many</b> thematic principles, concepts and belief in self/soul, but diverge in degree, style {{and some of their}} methods. Epistemologically, Yoga school accepts three means to reliable knowledge, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six ways. Yoga disputes the monism of Advaita Vedanta. Yoga school believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as an independent identity; Advaita Vedanta, in contrast, believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as part of Oneness with everything, everyone and the Universal Self. They both hold that the free conscience is aloof yet transcendent, liberated and self-aware. Further, Advaita Vedanta school enjoins the use of Patanjali's yoga practices and the reading of Upanishads for those seeking the supreme good, ultimate freedom and jivanmukti.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} in group 12 are usually {{considered to be}} d-block elements, but not transition elements as the d-shell is full. Some authors classify these elements as main-group elements because the valence electrons are in ns2 orbitals. Nevertheless, they <b>share</b> <b>many</b> characteristics with the neighboring group 11 elements on the periodic table, which are almost universally considered to be transition elements. For example, zinc shares many characteristics with the neighboring transition metal, copper. Zinc complexes merit inclusion in the Irving-Williams series as zinc forms many complexes with the same stoichiometry as complexes of copper(II), albeit with smaller stability constants. There is little similarity between cadmium and silver as compounds of silver(II) are rare {{and those that do}} exist are very strong oxidizing agents. Likewise the common oxidation state for gold is +3, which precludes there being much common chemistry between mercury and gold, though there are similarities between mercury(I) and gold(I) such as the formation of linear dicyano complexes, −. According to IUPAC's definition of transition metal as an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell, zinc and cadmium are not transition metals, while mercury is. This is because only mercury is known to have a compound where its oxidation state is higher than +2, in mercury(IV) fluoride (though its existence is disputed, as later experiments trying to confirm its synthesis could not find evidence of HgF4). However, this classification is based on one highly atypical compound seen at non-equilibrium conditions and is at odds to mercury's more typical chemistry, and Jensen has suggested {{that it would be better}} to regard mercury as not being a transition metal.|$|E
5|$|The marsh shrew and the American {{water shrew}} (Sorex pallustris) <b>share</b> <b>many</b> {{physical}} characteristics. The former {{is found in}} a narrower area from the northwest coast to the lower slopes of the inland mountains. The American water shrew is more widely distributed across the western mountains and through the subarctic regions of Canada and the eastern U.S. The species' ranges are primarily allopatric; although they may overlap (sympatry) in coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, differences in elevation tend to separate them. Early taxonomists placed these mammals into separate subgenera; Merriam assigned the marsh shrew to Atophyrax, and Jackson (1928) assigned the Pacific water shrew to Neosorex. A closer, dentition-based relationship was assigned by Findley (1955), with both species assigned to the subgenus Otisorex. Findley hypothesized {{that in the early}} Pleistocene, the ancestors of masked and vagrant shrews (Sorex cinereus and Sorex vagrans, respectively) diverged; during the Yarmouth interglacial, the American water shrew and marsh shrew diverged from their vagrant-shrew ancestors. Three other Sorex species evolved during the Sangamonian: the dwarf shrew (S. nanus), the southeastern shrew (Sorex longirostris) and the ornate shrew (Sorex ornatus). Findley's assignment of the marsh shrew and the American water shrew to Otisorex was later reinforced by biochemical and genetic studies. In 2005, findings were published (based on mitochondrial DNA analysis) which better defined the nature of the relationships between marsh shrews, Pacific water shrews and their respective subspecies. Variations in the sequencing of cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA were assessed, and the results of the 2005 phylogeny for the marsh shrew are shown below in detail.|$|E
