A single specimen was caught in the Gulf of Mannar and landed at Tuticorin fisheries harbour. On 16 September 2010, a single specimen of Caesio striata weighing approximately 200 g, was collected from Tuticorin fisheries harbour (south-east coast of India), from the by-catch landed by a motorized fishing vessel using a drift gill-net (net length 5000 m; net height 14 m). This is the first record of Caesio striata from the Bayof Bengal. It is assumed that this species might have extended its range in the Indian Ocean up to the Bay of Bengal via the Arabian Sea...|$|E
