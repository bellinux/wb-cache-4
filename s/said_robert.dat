25|$|On June 21, 1924, Goddard married Esther Christine Kisk (March 31, 1901 – June 4, 1982), a {{secretary}} in Clark University's President's office, {{whom he had}} met in 1919. She became enthusiastic about rocketry and photographed some of his {{work as well as}} aided him in his experiments and paperwork, including accounting. They enjoyed going to the movies in Roswell and participated in community organizations such as the Rotary and the Woman's Club. He painted the New Mexican scenery, sometimes with artist Peter Hurd, and played the piano. She played bridge, while he read. Esther <b>said</b> <b>Robert</b> participated in the community, and readily accepted invitations to speak to church and service groups. The couple did not have children. After his death, she sorted out Goddard's papers, and secured 131 additional patents on his work.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby {{began his}} review {{by calling the}} film [...] "very {{beautiful}} and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years. It's also so full of violence--of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story—that it's going to prompt {{a lot of people}} who do not know the real effect of movie violence (as I do not) to write automatic condemnations of it." [...] He said, [...] "Although the movie's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos, corruption, and defeat". Among the actors, he commented particularly on William Holden: [...] "After years of giving bored performances in boring movies, Holden comes back gallantly in The Wild Bunch. He looks older and tired, but he has style, both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he's always done, not because he really wants the money but because there's simply nothing else to do." [...] Time also liked Holden's performance, describing it as his best since Stalag 17 (a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar); <b>said</b> <b>Robert</b> Ryan gave [...] "the screen performance of his career"; and concluded that [...] "The Wild Bunch contains faults and mistakes" [...] (such as flashbacks [...] "introduced with surprising clumsiness"), but [...] "its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah, along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn, belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leno's first Tonight Show back {{pulled in}} 6.6 million viewers, and his margin over Letterman again held {{for much of}} the rest of his run until his second Tonight Show {{departure}} in 2014. While his numbers were down from his original incarnation of The Tonight Show, [...] "It's as if a collective erase button was pushed", <b>said</b> <b>Robert</b> Thompson, professor of television at Syracuse University, [...] "with the usual suspects back in their usual locations—except Conan is gone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Just so," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roberts.</b> [...] "And {{somehow it}} doesn't seem necessary, after all, to {{understand}} the niggers. In direct proportion to the white man's stupidity is his success in farming the world--" ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{the station}} opened, a long {{portion of the}} {{excavated}} historic wall was embedded permanently into {{the wall of the}} entrance to the newly constructed station. [...] "This wall most likely is a portion of the gun batteries that once protected the city in the late 17th and 18th centuries and gave rise to the modern park name," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Robert</b> Tierney, chairman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The city and the New York City Transit Authority plan to work together to preserve the remains, which were described as [...] "an important remnant of the history of New York City." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{mission that}} {{captured}} Saddam Hussein was called [...] "Operation Red Dawn". It was planned {{and carried out}} by JSOC's Delta Force and SAD/SOG teams (together called Task Force 121). The operation eventually included around 600 soldiers from the 1st Brigade of the 4th Infantry Division. Special operations troops probably numbered around 40. Much of the publicity and credit for the capture went to the 4th Infantry Division soldiers, but CIA and JSOC were the driving force. [...] "Task Force 121 were actually the ones who pulled Saddam out of the hole" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Robert</b> Andrews, former deputy assistant Secretary of Defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict. [...] "They can't be denied a role anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Althea Gibson (August 25, 1927 – September 28, 2003) was an American {{tennis player}} and {{professional}} golfer, {{and the first}} black athlete to cross the color line of international tennis. In 1956, {{she became the first}} person of color to win a Grand Slam title (the French Open). The following year she won both Wimbledon and the U.S. Nationals (precursor of the U.S. Open), then won both again in 1958, and was voted Female Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press in both years. [...] In all, she won 11 Grand Slam tournaments, including six doubles titles, and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame and the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame. [...] "She {{is one of the greatest}} players who ever lived," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Robert</b> Ryland, a tennis contemporary and former coach of Venus and Serena Williams. [...] "Martina couldn't touch her. I think she'd beat the Williams sisters." [...] In the early 1960s she also became the first black player to compete on the women's professional golf tour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Reckon we'll {{have to make}} camp right here," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roberts,</b> looking around. [...] "Lucky I've a pack on that saddle. I {{can make}} you comfortable. But we'd better be careful about a fire an' not have one after dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They ain't exactly THAT," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roberts,</b> {{still with}} embarrassment. [...] "The fact is--ye see--the thing points THIS way: they ain't {{no right to}} be here, and it's as much as my place is worth if it leaks out that they are." ...|$|R
2500|$|Chief Justice of the United States John G. Roberts was {{reported}} to have {{been a member of the}} society, but Roberts's membership status was never definitively established.

2500|$|Producer Gerry Ayres {{had bought}} the rights to Darryl Ponicsan's novel in 1969. After {{returning}} from the set of Drive, He <b>Said,</b> <b>Robert</b> Towne began adapting the novel. The screenwriter tailored the script for close friends Jack Nicholson and Rupert Crosse. In adapting the novel, Towne removed Buddusky's [...] "closet intellectualism and his beautiful wife". The screenwriter also changed the ending so that Buddusky lives instead of dying as he does in the book. Ayres convinced Columbia Pictures to produce the film based on his consultant's credit on Bonnie & Clyde but had difficulty getting it made because of the studio's concern about the bad language in Townes's script. Peter Guber recalls, [...] "The first seven minutes, there were 342 'fucks'". The head of Columbia asked Towne {{to reduce the number}} of curse words to which the writer responded, [...] "This is the way people talk when they're powerless to act; they bitch". Towne refused to tone down the language and the project remained in limbo until Nicholson, by then a bankable star, got involved.|$|E

[...] <b>said</b> <b>Roberts</b> quickly, {{yet still}} {{with a certain}} embarrassment; [...] "of course THAT'S better furnished, and she's quite satisfied, {{and so are the}} kids, with anything. And now, Mr. Breeze, I reckon you'll say nothin' o' this, and you'll never go back on me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Half {{the trouble}} is the stupidity of the whites," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roberts,</b> pausing to take a swig from his glass and to curse the Samoan bar-boy in affectionate terms. [...] "If the white man would lay himself out a bit to {{understand}} {{the workings of the}} black man's mind, most of the messes would be avoided." ...|$|R
5000|$|About 1540 the Lords of Council {{issued a}} summons against Ninian Trotter at the {{instance}} of Robert Lauder of the Bass (d.1576), {{who claimed that}} Mr.Trotter had interfered with people using Robert Lauders mill at Edrington in Berwickshire.

6000|$|... "Rot!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roberts,</b> {{trying to}} speak bravely, but he got up, and, with the others, huddled {{together}} {{at the end of}} the fo’c’s’le, and stared in a bewildered fashion at the sodden face and short, squat figure of our visitor. For his part, having finished his meal, he pushed his plate from him, and, leaning back on the locker, looked at the empty bunks.|$|R
