50|$|Do {{this same}} process with <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> B and <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> C.|$|E
50|$|You {{start with}} <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> A and <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> B {{make sure that}} all sides have no burrs on them and that it is clean. You can even use your hand to feel for {{anything}} and if so clean it off and deburr it before proceeding. Take <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> B or A but only one of them and use blue dye with a dye spotting tool and rub the plate down with it until its completely and nicely coated on the unfinished surface of that plate. Take the other uncoated plate and make sure there is no burrs or dirt, then put the uncoated <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> on to the coated blue dye <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> make sure to only softly put it on the coated plate. Rub the two plates together a couple of times to ensure the coated <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> makes contact with the uncoated <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> and highlights the high points of the uncoated <b>surface</b> <b>plate.</b> softly and slowly take off the <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> with the high points highlighted with blue dye. Use a hand scraper and scrape the high points highlighted with blue dye. Repeat the process until the scraped <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> has a uniformed surface highlighted with blue dye.|$|E

50|$|Before the Second World War, metal was the {{standard}} material used for <b>surface</b> <b>plates,</b> however, the war efforts of various countries put {{a strain on}} the availability of metal. A monument and metal shop owner (Wallace Herman) in Dayton, Ohio, along with his inventive employee Donald V. Porter, started using granite in place of metal for his <b>surface</b> <b>plates.</b> Today most <b>surface</b> <b>plates</b> continue to be made of black granite, more accurately referred to as black diabase, with the more wear-resistant <b>surface</b> <b>plates</b> being made of quartz-bearing granite. The quartz content of these granite <b>surface</b> <b>plates</b> increases the wear resistance of the plate as quartz is a harder stone. Black granite is dominantly used in machine bases, granite accessories, and custom applications for its superior stiffness, excellent vibration dampening, and improved machinability. Quartz-bearing granite (usually pink, white, or grey) is often made thicker than black granite to provide equal load-bearing capabilities of the types of material used for <b>surface</b> <b>plates</b> as it is not as stiff as black granite.|$|R
50|$|Cast-iron <b>surface</b> <b>plates</b> are now {{frequently}} used on production floors {{as a tool}} for lapping granite <b>surface</b> <b>plates</b> to achieve certain grades of accuracy. The metal allows itself to be impregnated with the lapping media over a large flat surface.|$|R
50|$|Damage to {{a granite}} <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> will usually {{result in a}} chip but {{does not affect the}} {{accuracy}} of the overall plane. Even though chipped, another flat surface can still make contact with the undamaged portion of a chipped <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> whereas damage to a cast-iron plate often raises the surrounding material above the working plane causing inspected objects to no longer sit parallel to the <b>surface</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

Three raw (plates {{that have}} been `seasoned` or residual stress relieved and received suitable surface treatments, but unfinished) cast <b>surface</b> <b>plates,</b> a flat scraper (as pictured {{at the top of}} the image) and a quantity of bearing blue (or Red Lead) were all that was required in the way of tools.|$|R

5000|$|The easiest {{method for}} {{measuring}} flatness {{is with a}} height gauge positioned on a <b>surface</b> <b>plate.</b> Note that you must set up the part on three stands and find the minimum variation while adjusting them, just placing the part on the <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> and using a dial indicator to find TIR {{on the opposite side}} of the part measures parallelism. Flatness is more easily measured with a co-ordinate measuring machine. But neither of these methods can measure flatness more accurately than about 0.0001" [...] (2.5μm).|$|E
50|$|The <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> {{is used in}} {{conjunction}} with accessories such as a square, straight edge, gauge blocks, sine bar, sine plate, dial indicator, parallels, angle plate, height gauge, etc.|$|E
40|$|Flatness departures of <b>surface</b> <b>plates</b> are {{generally}} obtained from straightness measurements of {{lines on the}} surface. A computer program has been developed for on-line measurement and evaluation, based on the simultaneous coupling of measurements in all grid points. Statistical methods are {{used to determine the}} accuracy of the measurements. The program runs on standard personal computers and supports different types of measuring instruments like electronic levels, autocollimators, laser interferometers or straight edge based instruments. Apart from the given height map, some meaningful characteristic parameters: sphericity, torsion and waviness are obtained. They have been proven very valuable to record long term effects of <b>surface</b> <b>plates.</b> Reliable measurements with an accuracy of 0. 1 μm/m demonstrate the capabilities of the method...|$|R

40|$|For a {{fluid layer}} or a self-gravitating fluid sphere uniformly heated from within, the {{internal}} temperature can be parameterized {{in terms of}} the appropriate Rayleigh number. The heat generation term includes both radioactive heat release and transient heating or cooling. This parameterization has been verified by comparisons with laboratory experiments. Thermal history calculations have been carried out for the earth, Venus, Mars, Mercury, and the moon. The results for the earth and Venus indicate that two scales of convection are occurring, one including the <b>surface</b> <b>plates</b> and the second occurring beneath the <b>surface</b> <b>plates.</b> In all cases the present heat flows are between seven and twelve per cent greater than the values obtained assuming a steady state balance between heat flow and internal heat generation...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> is a solid, {{flat plate}} {{used as the}} main {{horizontal}} reference plane for precision inspection, marking out (layout), and tooling setup. The <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> is often used as the baseline for all measurements to a workpiece, therefore one primary surface is finished extremely flat with accuracy up to 0.00001 in for a grade AA or AAA plate. Surface plates are a very common tool in the manufacturing industry and are often permanently attached to robotic-type inspection devices such as a coordinate-measuring machine. Plates are typically square or rectangular. One current British Standard includes specifications for plates from 160 mm × 100 mm to 2500 mm × 1600 mm.|$|E
50|$|Hand {{scraping}} a <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> kind {{of works}} {{the same way}} but instead of filling anything in, you are only removing the high points found using the blue dye after the surface plates have been rubbed and rotated together with the blue dye on it.|$|E
50|$|The {{importance}} of the high-precision <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> was first recognised by Henry Maudslay around 1800. He originated the systems of scraping a cast-iron plate to flatness, rubbing marking blue between pairs of plates to highlight imperfections, and of working plates in sets of three to guarantee flatness by avoiding matching concave and convex pairs.|$|E

The smallest movements of the Earth's <b>surface</b> (<b>plate</b> tectonics, volcanism, earthquake) are further scientific fields of application.|$|E
50|$|In the toolroom, the {{distinction}} between a height gauge and a surface gauge is that a height gauge has a measuring head (whether vernier, fine rack and pinion with dial, or linear encoder with digital display), whereas a surface gauge has only a scriber point. Both are typically used on a <b>surface</b> <b>plate</b> and have a heavy base with an accurately flat, smooth underside.|$|E

50|$|Prior to World War II, {{almost all}} <b>surface</b> <b>plates</b> {{were made from}} ribbed cast iron with the ribbing used to {{increase}} stiffness without incurring the weight of solid construction.
