25|$|Manufacturing {{sector in}} Guwahati {{contributes}} a substantial share {{to the economy}} of the city. Petroleum manufacturing is an important economic activity of the city. The Guwahati Refinery is the most important manufacturing industry in the city. Located at Noonmati, the refinery was set up by the Indian Oil Corporation Limited as the first public sector refinery of India as well as the refinery of Indian Oil since 1962. It was built with an initial crude processing capacity of 0.75nbsp&million metric tons per annum (MMTPA) {{at the time of its}} commission which was gradually increased to 1.0nbsp&MMTPA. It produces various products and supplies them to the other northeast states and also beyond to Siliguri through the Guwahati-Siliguri pipeline. The various products produced by the refinery include Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Kerosene Oil, Turbine Fuel (aviation use), Motor Spirit, High <b>Speed</b> <b>Motor</b> Diesel, Light Diesel Oil and Raw Petroleum Coke. There is also an LPG bottling plant in the city.|$|E

50|$|Also, {{direct-drive}} mechanisms need a {{more precise}} control mechanism. High <b>speed</b> <b>motors</b> with <b>speed</b> reduction have relatively high inertia, which helps smooth the output motion. Most motors exhibit positional torque ripple known as cogging torque. In high <b>speed</b> <b>motors,</b> this effect is usually negligible, as the frequency at which it occurs is too high to significantly affect system performance; direct drive units will suffer more from this phenomenon, unless additional inertia is added (i.e. by a flywheel) or the system uses feedback to actively counter the effect.|$|R
