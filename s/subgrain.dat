2500|$|In {{the initial}} stage, or primary creep, or {{transient}} creep, the strain rate is relatively high, but decreases with increasing time and strain {{due to a}} process analogous to work hardening at lower temperatures. For instance, the dislocation density increases and, in many materials, a dislocation <b>subgrain</b> structure is formed and the cell size decreases with strain. The strain rate diminishes to a minimum and becomes near constant as the secondary stage begins. This {{is due to the}} balance between work hardening and annealing (thermal softening). The secondary stage, referred to as [...] "steady-state creep", is the most understood. The microstructure is invariant during this stage, which means that recovery effects are concurrent with deformation. No material strength is lost during these first two stages of creep.|$|E
50|$|A <b>subgrain</b> {{is a part}} of {{the grain}} that is only {{slightly}} disoriented from other parts of the grain. Current research is being done to see the effect of <b>subgrain</b> strengthening in materials. Depending on the processing of the material, subgrains can form within the grains of the material. For example, when Fe-based material is ball-milled for long periods of time (e.g. 100+ hours), subgrains of 60-90 nm are formed. It has been shown that the higher the density of the subgrains, the higher the yield stress of the material due to the increased <b>subgrain</b> boundary. The strength of the metal was found to vary reciprocally with the size of the <b>subgrain,</b> which is analogous to the Hall-Petch equation. The <b>subgrain</b> boundary strengthening also has a breakdown point of around a <b>subgrain</b> size of 0.1 µm, which is the size where any subgrains smaller than that size would decrease yield strength. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TXD-4MRFCBJ-7&_user=501045&_coverDate=08%2F15%2F2007&_alid=654367194&_rdoc=3&_fmt=full&_orig=search&_cdi=5588&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_ct=86&_acct=C000022659&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=501045&md5=66df0d7de746d813ad753d4b2e261581.|$|E
50|$|With {{increasing}} {{temperature and}} decreasing strain rate, quartz deformation can yield numerous microsturctures. Each microstructures represents different deformational process and condition which is grouped into three regimes: Bulging (BLG), <b>Subgrain</b> Rotation (SGR), and Grain Boundary Migration (GBM). As the deformation mechanisms changes from BLG, SGR, to GBM, the recrystallized grain sizes becomes larger. The dynamic recovery and recrystallisation {{is the result}} of two processes: <b>Subgrain</b> Rotation and Grain Boundary Migration. <b>Subgrain</b> rotation means as the dislocation moves into the <b>subgrain</b> wall,the misorientation angle between two subgrains increases. Grain Boundary Migration makes the diffusion from one side of a grain boundary to the other happen.|$|E

40|$|The microstructures {{developed}} during steady-state creep of Al-Mg alloys containing 1. 77 - 7. 72 at. % Mg were examined using optical and electron microscopy. <b>Subgrains</b> {{were found in}} specimens crept at lower stresses where the stress exponent is about 3, and viscous glide {{is considered to be}} rate controlling. This is contrary to normally accepted mechanisms where <b>subgrains</b> and cell structures are considered to be formed only when recovery is rate controlling and the stress exponent is approximately 5. However, because the <b>subgrains</b> were also found in the head sections (unstrained), {{the presence or absence of}} <b>subgrains</b> merely reflects the condition prior to testing, rather than that {{developed during}} creep. The size of the grains and <b>subgrains</b> decreases with increasing creep stress and/or magnesium content. An AlMg precipitate has been identified in the Al- 7. 72 at. % Mg alloy after creep and is considered to give rise to the higher stress exponent of steady-state creep (n ∼ 4) for this alloy...|$|R
50|$|Sub-grain {{formation}} {{is followed by}} <b>subgrain</b> coarsening where the average size increases {{while the number of}} subgrains decreases. This reduces the total area of grain boundary and hence the stored energy in the material. <b>Subgrain</b> coarsen shares many features with grain growth.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} mechanisms that accommodate crystal-plastic deformation. In crustal rocks the most important processes are dislocation creep and diffusion creep. Dislocation generation acts to increase the internal energy of crystals. This effect is compensated through grain-boundary-migration recrystallization which reduces the internal energy by increasing the grain boundary area and reducing the grain volume, storing energy at the mineral grain surface. This process tends to organize dislocations into <b>subgrain</b> boundaries. As more dislocations are added to <b>subgrain</b> boundaries, the misorientation across that <b>subgrain</b> boundary will increase until the boundary becomes a high-angle boundary and the <b>subgrain</b> effectively becomes a new grain. This process, {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>subgrain</b> rotation recrystallization,acts to reduce the mean grain size. Volume and grain-boundary diffusion, the critical mechanisms in diffusion creep, become important at high temperatures and small grain sizes. Thus some researchers have argued that as mylonites are formed by dislocation creep and dynamic recrystallization, a transition to diffusion creep can occur once the grain size is reduced sufficiently.Mylonites generally develop in ductile shear zones where high rates of strain are focused. They are the deep crustal counterparts to cataclastic brittle faults that create fault breccias.|$|E

40|$|Microstructural {{observations}} {{were conducted on}} NaCl single crystals after creep. The microstructure after a stress increase followed by a stress decrease consisted primarily of cells; no significant number of <b>subgrains</b> were observed although they {{were present in the}} microstructures produced during uninterrupted tests. Prestraining in the exponential creep regime produced an uniform distribution of dislocations and a few subboundaries which transformed to equiaxed <b>subgrains</b> when tested in the power law creep region. This substructure was similar to that observed in an as-received specimen deformed to an equivalent strain. Prior creep in the power law creep region produced equiaxed <b>subgrains</b> whose boundaries were found to be mechanically stable when the specimen was retested in the exponential creep region.

50|$|Following an {{increase}} in temperature, the dominant texture changes to one marked {{by the presence of}} distinct <b>subgrains.</b> Recognizable in thin section by a more polygonized texture, the increased softening of the quartz allows for more thorough reduction of internal stresses. Recrystallized grains show relatively straight grain boundaries and little to no intragranular deformation feature, such as undulose extinction or deformation lamellae. Volume proportion of recrystallized grains in this regime roughly ranges from 30-90%, forming <b>subgrains</b> not only in interstitial space, but also within larger crystals or ribbon grains. <b>Subgrains</b> and recrystallized grains are roughly equal in size and shape.|$|R
50|$|Rotation {{recrystallization}} (<b>subgrain</b> rotation) is {{the progressive}} misorientation of a <b>subgrain</b> as more dislocations {{move into the}} dislocation wall (a zone of dislocations resulting from climb, cross-slip, and glide), which increases the crystallographic mismatch across the boundary. Eventually, the misorientation across the boundary is sufficiently large enough to recognize individual grains (usually 10-15° misorientation). Grains tend to be elongate or ribbon-shape, with many subgrains, with a characteristic gradual transition from low-angle subgrains to high-angle boundaries.|$|E
