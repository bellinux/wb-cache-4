5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber <b>stopper,</b> a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber <b>stopper</b> and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E

5|$|A prototypical late bloomer, Johnson overcame early {{struggles and}} had a {{successful}} NBA playing career. Drafted 29th overall in 1976 by the Seattle SuperSonics, Johnson began his professional career as a shooting guard. He eventually led the Sonics to their only NBA championship in 1979, winning the Finals MVP Award. After a short stint with the Phoenix Suns, he became the starting point guard for the Boston Celtics, with whom he won two more championships. Johnson was voted into five All-Star Teams, one All-NBA First and one Second Team, and nine consecutive All-Defensive First and Second Teams. Apart from {{his reputation as a}} defensive <b>stopper,</b> Johnson was known as a clutch player who made several decisive plays in NBA playoffs history.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{fitted in}} well at Stoke, as Waddington built {{a team of}} veteran players who were judged {{by some to be}} past their best.

Banks remained a reliable <b>stopper</b> for the club, though on 1 March 1969 he was knocked unconscious at Roker Park by Sunderland's Malcolm Moore, and his replacement David Herd conceded four goals in a 4–1 defeat. Banks also played a season for the Cleveland Stokers of the American United Soccer Association in the summer of 1968: he played seven of the short-lived club's 12 games in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|In the 1999–2000 NBA season, Bowen {{signed with}} the Philadelphia 76ers, and was later traded to the Chicago Bulls and {{immediately}} waived, then picked up off waivers by the Miami Heat. In that season, he wore jersey #12 instead of #30 and appeared in 69 games, averaging 2.8 points and 1.4 rebounds in 12.7 minutes per game, and scored in double-figures six times. In the following year, Bowen was retained by the Heat. In that year, he had his breakout season. For {{the first time in}} his career, he played in all 82 regular season games, averaged 7.6 points, 3.0 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.01 steals in 32.7 minutes per game and set new single season career-highs in games, points, rebounds, assists, blocks, minutes, field goals made and attempted, three-point goals made and attempted and free throws made and attempted. Bowen logged more minutes (2,685 vs. 2,678), scored more points (623 vs. 606) and hit more threes (103 vs. 54) than he had in his first four seasons combined.

5|$|The team's strong stretch did not continue, however, as the Phillies {{entered the}} second period of interleague play with five {{consecutive}} series against the American League East. While they managed a single win against the Boston Red Sox, {{it was followed by}} a six-game losing streak wherein the Phillies were swept by the Toronto Blue Jays and the Baltimore Orioles; Philadelphia was outscored 38–19 over the two series. The team showed promise in the first game of their World Series rematch series with the Tampa Bay Rays, winning 10–1, but were defeated in the last two games of the series and lost a fourth straight game to Toronto on June 26. However, the Phillies were able to exact a modicum of revenge for both their 1993 World Series defeat and the first series sweep by the Jays by winning the last two games. Happ played the role of <b>stopper</b> by pitching his first career complete game shutout, and Moyer followed by earning his 252nd victory in the following game.

25|$|A Snyder {{column is}} an {{extremely}} effective air-cooled column used in selected fractional distillations. It is a single glass tube {{with a series of}} circular indentations/restrictions in the walls of the cylinder (e.g., 3 or 6) in which rest, inverted, the same number of roughly tear-shaped, hollow, sealed glass stoppers; above each point where an inverted tear-shaped <b>stopper</b> rests, the cylinder has further Vigreux-type indentations, in this case serving to limit how high the glass <b>stopper</b> can be raised (by vapor flow) above its resting place, where, when not raised, it seals the circular opening created by the circular indentation. These floating glass stoppers act as check valves, closing and opening with vapor flow, and enhancing vapor-condensate mixing. A standard application of Snyder columns, is as the condenser/fractionation column above a Kuderna-Danish concentrator, used to efficiently separate a low boiling extraction solvent such as methylene chloride from volatile but higher boiling extract components (e.g., after the extraction of organic contaminants in soil).|$|E

40|$|The current {{design of}} seismically {{isolated}} bridges usually combines the use of bearings and <b>stoppers,</b> as a second line of defence. The <b>stoppers</b> allow {{the development of the}} in-service movements of the bridge deck, without transmitting significant loads to the piers and their foundations, while during earthquake they transmit the entire seismic action. Despite the fact that <b>stoppers,</b> which restrain the transverse seismic movements of the deck, are used frequently in seismically isolated bridges, the use of longitudinal <b>stoppers</b> is relatively rare, mainly due to the large in-service constraint movements of bridges. The present paper proposes a new type of external longitudinal <b>stoppers,</b> which are installed in stiff sub-structures-boundaries, aiming at limiting the bridge seismic movements. The parametric investigation, which was conducted in order to identify the seismic efficiency of the external <b>stoppers,</b> showed that the interaction of the bridge with the stiff boundaries can lead to significant reductions in the seismic movements of the bridge. Serviceability is appropriately arranged in the paper by expansion joints and approach slabs. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B. V...|$|R

40|$|Background: Sudden {{discontinuation}} of some antihypertensive agents such as beta-blockers and centrally acting antihypertensive {{agents are}} associated with increased risk of acute coronary events. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the association between discontinuation of different antihypertensive agents and the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods: A nested case control study was performed in a cohort of antihypertensive drug users from the Utrecht Cardiovascular Pharmacogenetics (UCP) database. Within this cohort, patients who were hospitalized for first AMI were considered cases. Cases were matched (1 up to 4) to controls at the same AMI date (index date). Antihypertensive users were defined as current users if the index date fell within prescribed duration or as <b>stoppers</b> if this date fell outside the prescribed duration. According to recency of stopping, <b>stoppers</b> were divided into recent <b>stoppers</b> (≤ 90 days), intermediate-term <b>stoppers</b> (91 - 180 days), and longterm <b>stoppers</b> (> 180 days). The study included only antihypertensive users who were specifically current users or <b>stoppers</b> of one antihypertensive agent. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between the discontinuation of antihypertensive agents and the risk of AMI and to control for confounding. Results: We included 1245 cases and 4994 controls in our analysis. The risk of AMI was significantly increased with all <b>stoppers</b> of beta-blockers (adjusted OR: 1. 54, 95 %CI (1. 25 - 1. 90)), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (adjusted OR: 2. 25, 95 %CI (1. 53 - 3. 30)), and diuretics (adjusted OR: 1. 76, 95 %CI (1. 24 - 2. 48)) compared with current users. Moreover, the risk of AMI was significantly increased for longterm <b>stoppers</b> (beta-blockers, CCBs, angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics) and intermediate- term <b>stoppers</b> (beta-blockers and CCBs) versus current users. There was no difference in AMI risk between recent <b>stoppers</b> of antihypertensive agents versus current users. Conclusions: Discontinuation of antihypertensive agents increases the risk of AMI after more than 90 days of stopping. Adherence to antihypertensive agents plays an important role in reducing the risk of AMI in patients with hypertension...|$|R
