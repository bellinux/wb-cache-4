500|$|In his {{extensive}} {{survey of the}} Beatles' recording sessions, historian Mark Lewisohn confirmed that Starr was both proficient and remarkably reliable and consistent. According to Lewisohn, there were {{fewer than a dozen}} occasions in the Beatles' eight-year recording career where session breakdowns were caused by Starr making a mistake, while the vast majority of takes were stopped owing to mistakes by the other three Beatles. <b>Starr</b> <b>is</b> considered to have influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings, as well as placing the drums on high risers for visibility as part of the band. According to Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall, co-authors of Classic Rock Drummers: [...] "Ringo's fat tom sounds and delicate cymbal work were imitated by thousands of drummers." ...|$|E

500|$|They {{have also}} made an impact in Puerto Rico's music industry. In 1970, Raphy Leavitt {{organized}} a band with an original sound and style that became one of Puerto Rico's greatest salsa orchestras, [...] "La Selecta". [...] He selected the band's repertoire from songs with a particular, positive social message and philosophy, and arranged his new band's sound to be as raw and powerful as the typical all-trombone salsa sound in vogue at the time. This genre was made popular by Willie Col√≥n, but La Selecta featured the addition of trumpets to lighten up the sound melodically. Brenda K. <b>Starr</b> <b>is</b> a salsa singer who in 2002 won two Latin Grammy Awards, one for [...] "Best Salsa Album", for [...] "Temptation" [...] {{and the other in}} the category [...] "Best Salsa Single" [...] for [...] "Por Ese Hombre".

500|$|The band {{made three}} promotional clips for [...] "Hello, Goodbye". Filmed on 10 November 1967 at the Saville Theatre in London, the clips were {{directed}} by McCartney. The first one shows the Beatles {{dressed in their}} Sgt. Pepper uniforms, apart from a brief cut-away where the group are wearing their 1963-era matching collarless suits. In author John Winn's description of the three clips, this version shows the Beatles performing the song against a psychedelic backdrop, while over the coda they are joined on the stage by female hula dancers. <b>Starr</b> <b>is</b> seen playing a miniature drum kit and, unusually, Lennon appears without his granny glasses. In the second clip, the Beatles mime to the song dressed in more conventional attire and with the stage backdrop depicting a rural setting. The third version combines footage shot during these two scenes with the band playing the song before what Winn terms a [...] "glittery pastel backdrop".|$|E
500|$|Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{initially}} previewed by Billboard magazine, {{who said that}} [...] "Chili Peppers fans might be daunted by the album's elusive experimentalism." [...] A representative of American Recordings did not foresee the album as being viable in any mainstream music stores, and some retailers {{went as far as}} to ban it from being sold. After the album was released, Frusciante played three small performances, and participated in a few magazine interviews to promote the album, explaining in one interview that people would only be able to understand his work if [...] "their heads are capable of tripping out." [...] At one point shortly after release, Frusciante began searching for a string quartet to play the album with him on tour. The idea was eventually discarded when he could not find a band that [...] "understands why Ringo <b>Starr</b> <b>is</b> such a great drummer, can play Stravinsky, and also smokes pot." [...] The concept of a tour was ultimately abandoned as well, due to Frusciante's diminishing health.|$|E
25|$|<b>Starr</b> <b>was</b> born in Prestbury House, Hampton, at Richmond in the County of Middlesex, England to well-to-do {{land owning}} parents ("landed proprietors") William Brooks Close and Mary Baker Brooks Close.

2500|$|Complications, {{sometimes}} serious, {{have been}} reported following STARR, [...] but the procedure is now considered safe and effective. <b>STARR</b> <b>is</b> [...] contraindicated in patients with weak sphincters (fecal incontinence and urgency are a possible complication) and with anismus (paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor during attempted defecation). The operation {{has been shown to}} improve rectal sensitivity and decrease rectal volume, the reason thought to create urgency. 90% of patients do not report urgency 12 months after the operation. The anal sphincter may also be stretched during the operation. STARR was compared with biofeedback and found to be more effective at reducing symptoms and improving quality of life.|$|E

60|$|Since the Invention (and {{perfecting}} in some measure) of Telescopes, it {{has been}} observ'd by several, that the Sun and Moon neer the Horizon, are disfigur'd (losing that exactly-smooth terminating circular limb, which they are observ'd to have when situated neerer the Zenith) and are bounded with an edge every way (especially upon {{the right and left}} sides) ragged and indented like a Saw: which inequality of their limbs, I have further observ'd, not to remain always the same, but to be continually chang'd by a kind of fluctuating motion, not unlike that of the waves of the Sea, so as that part of the limb, which was but even now nick'd or indented in, is now protuberant, and will presently be sinking again; neither is this all but the whole body of the Luminaries, do in the Telescope, seem to be depress'd and slatted, the upper, and more especially the under side appearing neerer to the middle then really they are, and the right and left appearing more remote: whence the whole Area seems to be terminated by a kind of Oval. It is further observ'd, that the body, for the most part, appears red, or of some colour approaching neer unto it, as some kind of yellow; and this I have always mark'd, that the more the limb is slatted or ovalled, the more red does the body appear, though not always the contrary. It is further observable, that both fix'd Stars and Planets, the neerer they appear to the Horizon, the more red and dull they look, and the more they are observ'd to twinkle; in so much, that I have seen the Dog-starr to vibrate so strong and bright a radiation of light, as almost to dazle my eyes, and presently, almost to disappear. It is also observable, that those bright scintillations neer the Horizon, are not by much so quick and sudden in their consecutions of one another, as the nimbler twinklings of Stars neerer the Zenith. This is also notable, that the Starrs neer the Horizon, are twinkled with several colours; so as sometimes to appear red, sometimes more yellow, and sometimes blue, and this when the <b>Starr</b> <b>is</b> a pretty way elevated above the Horizon. I have further, very often seen some of the small Starrs of the fifth or sixth magnitude, at certain times to disappear for a small moment of time, and again appear more conspicuous, and with a greater luster. I have several times, with my naked eye, seen many smaller Starrs, such as may be call'd of the seventh or eighth magnitude to appear for a short space, and then vanish, which, by directing a small Telescope towards that part they appear'd and disappear'd in; I could presently find to be indeed small Starrs so situate, as I had seen them with my naked eye, and to appear twinkling like the ordinary visible Stars; nay, in examining some very notable parts of the Heaven, with a three foot Tube, me thought I now and then, in several parts of the constellation, could perceive little twinklings of Starrs, making a very short kind of apparition, and presently vanishing, but noting diligently the places where they thus seem'd to play at boe-peep, I made use of a very good twelve foot Tube, and with that it was not uneasie to see those, and several other degrees of smaller Starrs, and some smaller yet, that seem'd again to appear and disappear, and these also by giving the same Object-glass a much bigger aperture, I could plainly and constantly see appear in their former places; so that I have observ'd some twelve several magnitudes of Starrs less then those of the six magnitudes commonly recounted in the Globes.|$|E
