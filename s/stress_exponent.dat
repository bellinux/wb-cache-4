40|$|The nonequilibrium {{dynamics}} of diffusion-mediated plasticity and creep in materials subjected to constant load at high homologous temperatures is studied atomistically using Phase Field Crystal (PFC) methods. Creep stress and grain size exponents obtained for nanopolycrystalline systems, m ≃ 1. 02 and p ≃ 1. 98, respectively, closely match those expected for idealized diffusional Nabarro-Herring creep. These exponents are {{observed in the}} presence of significant stress-assisted diffusive grain boundary migration, indicating that Nabarro-Herring creep and stress-assisted boundary migration contribute in the same manner to the macroscopic constitutive relation. When plastic response is dislocation-mediated, power law <b>stress</b> <b>exponents</b> inferred from dislocation climb rates are found to increase monotonically from m ≃ 3, as expected for generic climb-mediated natural creep, to m ≃ 5. 8 as the dislocation density ρ_d is increased beyond typical experimental values. <b>Stress</b> <b>exponents</b> m ≳ 3 directly measured from simulations that include dislocation nucleation, climb, glide, and annihilation are attributed primarily to these large ρ_d effects. Extrapolation to lower ρ_d suggests that m ≃ 4 - 4. 5 should be obtained from our PFC description at typical experimental ρ_d values, which is consistent with expectations for power law creep via mixed climb and glide.

40|$|Abstract. Creep {{behavior}} of SUS {{304 stainless steel}} is studied by small punch creep (SP-C) test. Series of SP-C testing for SUS 304 stainless steel are carried out at 600 °C. The time dependence of the central deflection is obtained by the SP-C testing at different load level and the creep deflection curves are quantitatively similar to those observed in conventional uniaxial creep testing. In this paper, an analytic approach based on Chakrebarty’s membrane-stretch model is used to interpret the SP-C test method. The relationship between specimen central deflection and equivalent strain is deduced, {{and the relationship between}} load and equivalent stress are established.

The creep properties were evaluated at 423 K and 448 K (150 °C and 175 °C) under stresses in the range 90 to 110 MPa.

The present study on a pure 3 mol% yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia (3 YTZ) and 3 YTZ with 0. 39 or 3. 9 wt% silica involved a detailed characterization of creep {{over a wide range}} of experimental conditions and also tracer diffusion measurements.
