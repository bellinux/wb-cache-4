25|$|Also in 1980, Seymour {{was given}} the role of young theatre actress Elise McKenna in the period romance Somewhere in Time. Though the film was made with a {{markedly}} limited budget, the role enticed Seymour with a character she felt <b>she</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>The</b> effort was a decided break from her earlier work, and marked the start of her friendship with co-star Christopher Reeve.|$|E

She had also been required to memorize a verse from the Bible every day at Rockford, and listen to a short sermon on the daily verse by the school's principal.

The following month, Kahlo traveled to San Francisco for medical treatment for back pain and a fungal infection on her hand. Her continuously fragile health had been in increasing decline since her divorce and was exacerbated by her heavy consumption of alcohol.|$|E
25|$|VanDerveer was {{determined}} to play basketball in college. Her first choice was Mount Holyoke, but as one of five children, it wasn't financially possible for her to attend Mount Holyoke, so she chose Albany where her father had studied for his doctorate. It wasn't a great team, but <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> coach, which helped with the decision. The team turned out not be challenging enough. Although naturally a guard, she jumped center, and lead the team in many categories, despite being the freshman on the team. She decided she needed a bigger challenge so she talked some of her friends into attending the AIAW National Championship, where she watched many teams, took notes, and decided where she wanted to go. She chose Indiana where she transferred and spent three years, making the Dean's List {{each of the three}} years. In her sophomore year, 1973 she helped the team reach the Final Four of the AIAW championship, losing in the semi-finals to Queens College.|$|E

25|$|During this period, the MWRC {{networked}} {{with community}} cultural leaders through the Kimberley Aboriginal Law and Cultural Centre (KALACC), an Aboriginal organisation {{that supports the}} traditional practices of the 30 language groups in the Kimberley. Oscar revealed the significance of their support in the alcohol restriction campaign:It was really important to let elders know what was happening. We liaised with cultural leaders and elders through KALACC. KALACC helped facilitate approval from elders for the alcohol restrictions.The role of KALACC was critical; {{it would have been}} very interesting had they not supported the campaign. The support of KALACC managed some of the forces in the community.Oscar’s move to get the backing of elders and cultural leaders was a major factor in persuading the Director of Liquor Licensing to impose the alcohol restrictions and should not be underestimated. Certain sectors of the community were against the restrictions and the support from elders gave the MWRC campaign the legitimacy it needed in enduring strong criticism. In the face of fierce opposition from some members of her community who had a vested interest in the sale of alcohol, Oscar stood firm. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> restrictions would give her people much needed relief from the trauma and chaos caused by alcohol abuse.|$|E
25|$|Deep inside Hades' lair, {{an injured}} Hook awakens and notices {{a young woman}} who is also trapped with him in the chamber. As he struggles to move Hook convinces the young woman to run for help and asks for Emma. As they reach the exit, a three-headed hellhound creature, Cerberus, chases after the two. Above at the cemetery, Mary Margaret and David look at the gravestones of those who Mary Margaret felt she had failed as alluded in the flashback, But David is {{confident}} that they can protect Emma and tells Mary Margaret that she can be able to succeed. When she sees the tombstone of Hercules, David is surprised to learn that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> Demi-God, and believes that he has unfinished business with her, which gives them the idea to help him while seeking out Hook. Regina and Robin meet up with Emma and Henry. Regina tells Robin that she has maps at the Mayor's office and Henry and Robin head there but when Regina turns around Emma has took off and calls for her. Emma notices fresh blood and traces the direction, but instead they find the young woman and she says she knows Killian. As soon as they hear the roar of Cerberus, Emma uses her magic to take them to the Underworld version of Mary Margaret's apartment. Later on at Granny's Diner, Emma and Regina are joined by Mary Margaret, and thanks to the Blind Witch, they find Hercules, who they hope he will complete his Twelve Labors before he can move on, being Cerberus.|$|E
500|$|As the storyline concluded, Rae {{resolved}} to remain friends with Ste and support {{him through his}} difficult relationship with Brendan. This resulted in a feud between Brendan and herself.

500|$|Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, {{an affair}} that {{became known as}} [...] "Travelgate", began with charges that the White House had used audited {{financial}} irregularities in the Travel Office operation {{as an excuse to}} replace the staff with friends from Arkansas. The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo caused the investigation to focus on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true. The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made [...] "factually false" [...] statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> statements were false, or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.|$|E
500|$|Phantasmagoria was {{the first}} Sierra On-Line game script to be written like a film screenplay. During the writing stage, Williams was under {{pressure}} to ensure Phantasmagoria was a commercial success for Sierra. She also faced concerns from her husband Ken Williams, the company president and co-founder of Sierra, who wanted the company {{to focus more on}} lower-cost, combat-oriented animated games, and was also concerned about the level of violence in Phantasmagoria. Williams said <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> rape scene in particular would be controversial, but she felt it was essential to the plot because it was a turning point that made Adrienne realize something was deeply wrong with Don. She felt {{the rest of the story}} [...] "would make no sense" [...] without the scene, but also knew there was a chance it would be cut from the game before production ended.|$|E
500|$|Lead actress Kristen Bell, who deduced that Aaron Echolls was {{the killer}} in Season 1, {{was unable to}} figure out the {{identity}} of the murderer in Season 2. [...] "You never, ever see the show keep the killer in the main titles," [...] adding that the writers [...] "think they're so smart…and they are!" [...] Actor Michael Muhney, who plays Don Lamb, expressed some anxiety {{over the course of the}} season that he would be the killer. However, Bell played a prank on Muhney, telling him that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> killer was going to be Loretta Cancun, a minor character from the pilot. Bell said, [...] " [...] only believed me for like a day."

500|$|Voice {{director}} Tamlynn Barra managed {{that aspect}} of the game. [...] Schafer and Grossman described how they imagined the characters' voices and Barra sought audition tapes of voice actors to meet the criteria. She presented the best auditions to the pair. Schafer's sister Ginny was among the auditions, and she was chosen for Nurse Edna. Schafer opted out of the decision for her selection to avoid nepotism. Grossman and Schafer encountered difficulty selecting a voice for Bernard. To aid the process, Grossman commented that the character should sound like Les Nessman from the television show WKRP in Cincinnati. Barra responded that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> agent of the character's actor, Richard Sanders, and brought Sanders on the project. Denny Delk and Nick Jameson were among those hired, and provided voice work for around five characters each. Recording for the 4,500lines of dialog occurred at Studio 222 in Hollywood. Barra directed the voice actors separately from a sound production booth. She provided context for each line and described aspects of the game to aid the actors. The voice work in Day of the Tentacle was widely praised for its quality and professionalism in comparison to Sierra's talkie games of the period which suffered from poor audio quality and limited voice acting (some of which consisted of Sierra employees rather than professional talent).|$|E
500|$|The English dub was {{recorded}} at Cup of Tea Productions, and {{was directed by}} Sam Riegel, who also voiced Phoenix, having previously voiced the role in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Hsu was present for the recording, as <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> story and was the translator of the scripts, and thus could explain {{what was happening in}} each scene and what the motivations behind the lines were, as well as how she wanted the voice actors to deliver certain lines. Because Horiyama had attended the Japanese voice recording sessions, he was also present, so he could give advice about things that sounded too different from the Japanese version, and give consultation about technical issues within the game. The voice actors took turns recording their lines to near-final versions of the cutscenes, so they could match the characters' lip flaps. In addition to the voice acting, some sound effects had to be localized, due to sound being used differently in Japanese and Western films, resulting in different things sounding natural; one such case was the opening cutscene for the fourth episode. Due to the English voice acting occasionally becoming unintelligible when sound effects or music was played on top, the localization team had to lower the volume of the music at some points, move the sound backwards or forwards slightly, or raise the volume of certain consonants; the largest such issue was the voice clip for the [...] "Objection!" [...] interjection, where the [...] "b" [...] consonant initially was drowned by the sound effect.|$|E
500|$|Desmond flashbacks: {{the hatch}} is shown imploding again, and then Desmond (who was inside) {{suddenly}} {{wakes up in}} a London apartment with his girlfriend Penelope Widmore (Sonya Walger). Desmond is clearly puzzled, but is relieved to finally be with Penny again. Desmond later goes to Penny's billionaire father, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) and asks for his permission to marry his daughter. Widmore rejects Desmond, who is crushed and humiliated. Walking out of the building, Desmond sees Charlie singing and playing his guitar for money on the sidewalk. Desmond asks him if he remembers him but Charlie does not. Frustrated, Desmond rants about his time {{on the island and}} predicts it will rain, which it suddenly does. At a pub, Desmond meets with his friend, a physicist, and after retelling the events on the island asks him if time travel is possible. Desmond tries to predict more events but they do not happen and his friend assures him time travel is impossible. While shopping for a ring for Penny, Desmond runs into the shopkeeper, Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan). Hawking takes Desmond on a walk where they see a man crushed to death by falling scaffolding. She explains that although <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> man would die, she did not help because the universe has a way of [...] "course correcting", and he would die anyway. Desmond and Penny go on a walk together and take a picture, where he breaks up with her after realizing that he does not have enough money to support her. He returns to the pub, where one of his predictions before about the bartender being attacked finally comes true (proving that he really knew about the future, but that his timing was off), but he ends up being accidentally hit himself and is knocked out.
