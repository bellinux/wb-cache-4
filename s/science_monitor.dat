5000|$|The Christian <b>Science</b> <b>Monitor’s</b> Peter Rainer {{observed}} that the film broke new ground, as it [...] "was the first to really explore the issue of rape in the military" [...] and that [...] "the fact that this subject has taken so long to achieve full-scale exposure was itself symptomatic of the problem."

40|$|Structured Decision Making (SDM) {{should be}} used to develop a {{decision}} support model that evaluates trade-offs and consequences among alternative management actions. A decision-support model developed through SDM allows for efficient and strategic monitoring by assessing where reducing uncertainty (though monitoring data) could influence management decisions.

The resulting decision-support tool {{should be used}} to examine consequences of alternative flow management scenarios to determine costs and benefits to trust resources.
