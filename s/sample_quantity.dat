50|$|KF {{has a high}} {{accuracy}} and precision, typically within 1% of available water, e.g. 3.00% appears as 2.97 - 3.03%. Although KF is a destructive analysis, the <b>sample</b> <b>quantity</b> is small and is typically limited by the accuracy of weighing. For example, {{in order to obtain}} an accuracy of 1% using a scale with the typical accuracy of 0.2 mg, the sample must contain 20 mg water, which is e.g. 200 mg for a sample with 10% water. For coulometers, the measuring range is from 1-5 ppm to ca. 5%. Volumetric KF readily measures samples up to 100%, but requires impractically large amounts of sample for analytes with less than 0.05% water. The KF response is linear. Therefore, single-point calibration using a calibrated 1% water standard is sufficient and no calibration curves are necessary.|$|E

Samples containing more than 10 micrograms of Fe(0) in an X-band TE(104) cavity, or more than 0. 11 micrograms in a Ka-band cavity can cause errors greater than 1 % in the quantitative determination of Fe(0), as well as cause anomalous broadening of the FMR line.

40|$|Global {{estimates}} of sea-surface temperature (SST) distributions represent an important prescribed boundary condition for atmosphere-only general circulation models (AGCMs) which aim to Simulate the behaviour {{of the past}} climate system. We investigate the use of objective interpolation techniques, based on Delaunay triangulation and gridded-averaging, in translating point-based SST data into global maps. Existing global SST datasets generated by CLIMAP for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and PRISM for the middle Pliocene are used as vehicles for evaluation. Results indicate that the <b>sample</b> <b>quantity</b> and array of the CLIMAP sites are sufficient to faithfully reconstruct major surface water patterns of the LGM. However, as problems with <b>sample</b> <b>quantity</b> and distribution become more acute in pre-Quaternary periods, interpolators are limited {{in their ability to}} produce reasonable estimates in data sparse regions.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate 2 techniques for facial vein bleeding in conscious mice to ascertain whether differences in clinical outcomes, practicability of sample collection, and hematologic parameters were apparent. Blood samples were obtained from the facial vein of 40 BALB/c mice by using either a 21 -gauge needle or a lancet. Subsequently, the protocol was repeated with isoflurane-anesthetized mice sampled by using the lancet method (n = 20). Behavior immediately after sampling was observed, and <b>sample</b> <b>quantity,</b> sampling time, and time until bleeding ceased were measured. Clinical pathology data and hematoma diameter at necropsy were analyzed also. The mean <b>sample</b> <b>quantity</b> collected (approximately 0. 2 mL) was comparable among methods, but sampling was much more rapid when mice were anesthetized by using isoflurane. The only other noteworthy finding was a significantly reduced number of platelets in samples from anesthetized mice. Adverse, ongoing clinical signs were rare regardless of the method used. The results revealed no significant differences in welfare implications or blood sample quality among the methods or between conscious and anesthetized mice. Therefore, any of the methods we evaluated for obtaining blood samples from the facial vein are appropriate for use in research studies. Cassie C. Francisco, Gordon S. Howarth, Alexandra L.
