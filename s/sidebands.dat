5|$|The Leslie is {{specifically}} designed, via {{reproduction of the}} Doppler effect, to alter or modify sound. As the sound source is rotated around a specific pivot point, it produces tremolo (the modulation of amplitude) and a variation in pitch. This produces a sequence of frequency modulated <b>sidebands.</b> To stop a Leslie's rotor, a special brake circuit {{was added to the}} Leslie motor controls, that incorporated an electronic relay by producing a half-wave of direct current.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two <b>sidebands.</b> The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two <b>sidebands</b> both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>sidebands</b> are on {{both sides}} of the carrier, their count is doubled, and then multiplied by the {{modulating}} frequency to find the bandwidth. For example, 3kHz deviation modulated by a 2.2kHz audio tone produces a modulation index of 1.36. Suppose that we limit ourselves to only those <b>sidebands</b> that have a relative amplitude of at least 0.01. Then, examining the chart shows this modulation index will produce three <b>sidebands.</b> These three <b>sidebands,</b> when doubled, gives us (6 * 2.2kHz) or a 13.2kHz required bandwidth.|$|E

We show that the coherent mechanical pump induced enhancement of second-order <b>sideband</b> generation exhibits an essential difference between the case of a weak control field and a strong control field. In the weak control field case, the efficiency of second-order <b>sideband</b> {{generation in}}creases as the amplitude of the mechanical pump increases. In the strong control field case, the effect of optomechanically induced transparency occurs and increasing the amplitude of the mechanical pump does not always bring an enhancement of second-order <b>sideband</b> generation. The phase-dependent effect of the second-order <b>sideband</b> generation with a coherent mechanical pump is also discussed, and it is shown that the phase difference ϕ {{plays an important role in}} the process of second-order <b>sideband</b> generation...|$|R
25|$|Therefore, the {{modulated}} signal has three components: the carrier wave c(t) which is unchanged, and two pure sine waves (known as <b>sidebands)</b> with frequencies slightly {{above and below}} the carrier frequency fc.|$|E
25|$|These FM {{systems are}} unusual, {{in that they}} have a ratio of carrier to maximum {{modulation}} frequency of less than two; contrast this with FM audio broadcasting, where the ratio is around 10,000. Consider, for example, a 6-MHz carrier modulated at a 3.5-MHz rate; by Bessel analysis, the first <b>sidebands</b> are on 9.5 and 2.5MHz and the second <b>sidebands</b> are on 13MHz and −1MHz. The result is a reversed-phase sideband on +1MHz; on demodulation, this results in unwanted output at 6−1 = 5MHz. The system must be designed so that this unwanted output is reduced to an acceptable level.|$|E
25|$|Conventional amplitude-modulated signals can be {{considered}} wasteful of power and bandwidth because they contain a carrier signal and two identical <b>sidebands.</b> Therefore, SSB transmitters are generally designed to minimize the amplitude of the carrier signal.

40|$|Terahertz (THz) optical <b>sideband</b> {{generation}} in asymmetric double quantum wells in strong THz fields is studied theoretically. Both monotonic THz-power dependence and saturation of the first-order <b>sideband</b> intensity can occur, {{depending on the}} near infrared (NIR) and THz photon energies. In both respects the calculated <b>sideband</b> intensity behavior agrees with experimental findings (Appl. Phys. Lett. 75, 2728 (1999); Phys. Rev. B 70, 115312 (2004) ]. The nonmonotonic THz-power dependence and saturation of the <b>sideband</b> intensity are due to the excitonic Stark splitting. While the <b>sideband</b> saturation imposes limitations on the wavelength conversion efficiency, the simultaneous broadening of <b>sideband</b> resonances benefits wavelength conversion by {{increasing the number of}} NIR frequencies available for wavelength conversion.

25|$|Sometimes other peaks {{can be seen}} around 1H peaks, {{known as}} {{spinning}} <b>sidebands</b> and {{are related to the}} rate of spin of an NMR tube. These are experimental artifacts from the spectroscopic analysis itself, not an intrinsic feature of the spectrum of the chemical and not even specifically related to the chemical or its structure.|$|E
25|$|As a result, SSB {{transmissions}} use {{the available}} amplifier energy more efficiently, providing longer-range transmission {{with little or}} no additional cost. Receivers normally select one of the two <b>sidebands</b> to amplify anyway, so implementing SSB in the receiver is simply a matter of allowing it to choose which sideband to amplify on reception, rather than simply choosing one or the other in the design stage.|$|E
25|$|For {{the case}} of a carrier {{modulated}} by a single sine wave, the resulting frequency spectrum can be calculated using Bessel functions of the first kind, {{as a function of the}} sideband number and the modulation index. The carrier and sideband amplitudes are illustrated for different modulation indices of FM signals. For particular values of the modulation index, the carrier amplitude becomes zero and all the signal power is in the <b>sidebands.</b>|$|E

All mixer components, including the LO and RF distribution circuitry, are integrated into a single mixer block.

5000|$|If [...] {{is chosen}} {{larger than the}} highest {{frequency}} of [...] then [...] has no positive frequencies. In that case, extracting the real component restores them, but in reverse order; the low-frequency components are now high ones and vice versa.

25|$|Another {{improvement}} over standard AM is obtained through reduction or {{suppression of the}} carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the <b>sidebands,</b> yet it carries no unique information. Thus {{there is a great}} advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband (single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission) or with both <b>sidebands</b> remaining (double sideband suppressed carrier). While these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing synchronous detection and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.|$|E
25|$|SSB takes {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} entire original signal is encoded in either one of these <b>sidebands.</b> It is not necessary to broadcast the entire mixed signal, a suitable receiver can extract the entire signal from either the upper or lower sideband. This means that the amplifier can be used much more efficiently. A transmitter can choose to send only the upper or lower sideband, the portion of the signal above or below the carrier. By doing so, the amplifier only has to work effectively on one half the bandwidth, which is generally easier to arrange. More importantly, with the carrier suppressed before it reaches the amplifier, it can amplify the signal itself to higher energy, it is not wasting energy amplifying a signal, the carrier, that can (and will) be re-created by the receiver anyway.|$|E
25|$|When {{either side}} of the {{transformer}} is a tuned circuit, the amount of mutual inductance between the two windings, together with the Q factor of the circuit, determine the shape of the frequency response curve. The tuned circuit together with the transformer load form an RLC circuit with a definite peak in the frequency response. When both sides of the transformer are tuned, it is described as double-tuned. The coupling of double-tuned circuits is described as loose-, critical-, or over-coupled depending on the value of k. When two tuned circuits are loosely coupled through mutual inductance, the bandwidth will be narrow. As the amount of mutual inductance increases, the bandwidth continues to grow. When the mutual inductance is increased beyond a critical point, the peak in the response curve begins to drop, and the center frequency will be attenuated more strongly than its direct <b>sidebands.</b> This is known as overcoupling.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} system for {{stabilizing}} a laser to a frequency reference with an adjustable offset. The method locks a <b>sideband</b> signal generated by passing an incoming laser beam through the phase modulator to a frequency reference, and adjusts a carrier frequency {{relative to the}} locked <b>sideband</b> signal by changing a phase modulation frequency input to the phase modulator. The <b>sideband</b> signal can be a single <b>sideband</b> (SSB), dual <b>sideband</b> (DSB), or an electronic <b>sideband</b> (ESB) signal. Two separate electro-optic modulators can produce the DSB signal. The two electro-optic modulators can be a broadband modulator and a resonant modulator. With a DSB signal, the method can introduce two sinusoidal phase modulations at the phase modulator. With ESB signals, the method can further drive the optical phase modulator with an electrical signal with nominal frequency OMEGA(sub 1) that is phase modulated at a frequency OMEGA(sub 2...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} three different methods known as <b>sideband</b> level suppression (SBL), <b>sideband</b> radiation suppression (SR), and <b>sideband</b> bound suppression (SB) which are used in <b>sideband</b> calculations for time-modulated arrays (TMAs) is presented.

500|$|Absorption filters {{dissipate}} {{the energy}} in unwanted frequencies internally as heat. [...] This {{is in contrast}} to a conventional filter design where the unwanted frequencies are reflected back from the input port of the filter. [...] Such filters are used where it is undesirable for power to be sent back towards the source. [...] This is the case with high power transmitters where returning power can be high enough to damage the transmitter. [...] An absorption filter may be used to remove transmitter spurious emissions such as harmonics or spurious <b>sidebands.</b> [...] A design that has been in use for some time has slots cut in the walls of the feed waveguide at regular intervals. [...] This design is known as a leaky-wave filter. [...] Each slot is connected to a smaller gauge waveguide which is too small to support propagation of frequencies in the wanted band. [...] Thus those frequencies are unaffected by the filter. [...] Higher frequencies in the unwanted band, however, readily propagate along the side guides which are terminated with a matched load where the power is absorbed. [...] These loads are usually a wedge shaped piece of microwave absorbent material. [...] Another, more compact, design of absorption filter uses resonators with a lossy dielectric.|$|E
2500|$|The second common {{consideration}} is limiting {{the amount of}} reference frequency energy (ripple) appearing at the phase detector output that is then applied to the VCO control input.

2500|$|One {{method of}} {{producing}} an SSB signal {{is to remove}} one of the <b>sidebands</b> via filtering, leaving only either the upper sideband (USB), the sideband with the higher frequency, or less commonly the lower sideband (LSB), the sideband with the lower frequency. Most often, the carrier is reduced or removed entirely (suppressed), being referred to in full as single sideband suppressed carrier (SSBSC). Assuming both <b>sidebands</b> are symmetric, which {{is the case for}} a normal AM signal, no information is lost in the process. [...] Since the final RF amplification is now concentrated in a single sideband, the effective power output is greater than in normal AM (the carrier and redundant sideband account for well over half of the power output of an AM transmitter). Though SSB uses substantially less bandwidth and power, it cannot be demodulated by a simple envelope detector like standard AM.|$|E

30|$|A {{possible}} {{scenario is}} that <b>sideband</b> wave formation {{plays an important}} role in MHD turbulence and is motivated by the recent observational confirmation about the existence of <b>sideband</b> waves adjacent to the linear-mode branch in solar wind turbulence (Perschke et al. 2013, 2014) Energy transport in the frequency domain represents generation of <b>sideband</b> waves. For quasi-perpendicular propagations, the fast mode has finite frequencies, while the other two MHD wave modes, Alfvèn and slow, have zero frequency. <b>Sideband</b> waves develop in such a way that the energy stored along the linear-mode branches flows toward <b>sideband</b> waves. The wave study shown in this manuscript indicates that it is unlikely to excite <b>sideband</b> waves toward higher frequencies. The energy transport in the frequency domain is slower than the transport in the wavenumber domain. Therefore, most of the fluctuation energies is constrained to lower frequencies, e.g., up to the frequencies of the fast mode. The <b>sideband</b> formation influences the wavevector anisotropy, as well. The observational result that most of the fluctuation energies are associated with quasi-perpendicular wavevectors to the mean magnetic field indicates a scenario that the <b>sideband</b> wave formation is not an isotropic process but anisotropic, presumably because the zero-frequency or nearly zero-frequency mode as realized by the perpendicular wavevector limit of the Alfvén and the slow modes are more essential in MHD turbulence. The wave evolution scenario into turbulence is illustrated in Fig.  10.|$|R
