5|$|Thorium is a {{moderately}} hard, paramagnetic, bright silvery radioactive actinide metal. In the periodic table, it lies {{to the right}} of actinium, to the left of protactinium, and below cerium. Pure thorium is very ductile and, as normal for metals, can be cold-rolled, <b>swaged,</b> and drawn. At room temperature, thorium metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure; it has two other forms at exotic conditions, one at high temperature (over 1360°C; body-centred cubic) and one at high pressure (around 100GPa; body-centred tetragonal).|$|E
25|$|In surgery, {{the thread}} used in sutures is often <b>swaged</b> to an eyeless needle {{in order to}} prevent damage as the needle and suture thread are drawn through the wound.|$|E
25|$|A more {{economical}} alternative was {{made available to}} the handloader in the 1980s, the copper-plated bullet. Copper-plated bullets are lead bullets that are electroplated with a copper jacket. While thinner than a <b>swaged</b> bullet jacket, the plated jacket is far thicker than normal electroplate, and provides significant structural integrity to the bullet. Since the jacket provides the strength, soft lead can be used, which allows bullets to be <b>swaged</b> or cast into shape before plating. While not strong enough for most rifle cartridges, plated bullets work well in many handgun rounds, with a recommended maximum velocity of 1250ft/s (375m/s). Plated bullets fall between cast and traditional jacketed bullets in price.|$|E

5000|$|Swaging: <b>Swaging</b> (necking) is {{the process}} of [...] "necking down" [...] a feature on a part. <b>Swaging</b> is the {{opposite}} of bulging as it reduces the size of the part. The end of a shell casing that captures the bullet is an example of <b>swaging.</b>|$|R
40|$|Rotary <b>swaging</b> is an {{incremental}} bulk metal forming {{process for the}} manufacture of cylindrical lightweight components. Whilst conventional rotary <b>swaging</b> is still carried under the intense use of lubricants to provide desired work piece quality and to avoid forming die wear, recent scientific work focuses {{on the design of}} a dry process layout. Novel functionalized rotary <b>swaging</b> dies were introduced, exhibiting both diamond like carbon (DLC) hard coated and structured surfaces to encounter complex and opposing tribological requirements when dry machining. Such dies were successfully applied to infeed rotary <b>swaging</b> experiments machining steel 1. 0038 and aluminum 3. 3206 tubes. Although primary targets were achieved, the dry rotary <b>swaging</b> process is subject to an increased abrasive particle generation from the work piece material and accumulation of such particles in the forming zone. Abrasive particles provoke a loss of work piece quality and ultimately lead to a clogging of the <b>swaging</b> unit, associated with a significant earlier termination of the forming process. This work presents the investigation of the particle generation when dry rotary <b>swaging</b> with functionalized forming dies in dependence on the work piece material and the process parameter feed velocity. Subsequently, improvements of the die s design are discussed which are to reduce the generation of abrasive particles and conveying the particles from the <b>swaging</b> unit, indispensable for the robust layout of dry rotary <b>swaging</b> processes...|$|R
25|$|In {{ammunition}} manufacture, <b>swaged</b> bullets are bullets {{manufactured by}} compressing metal {{at room temperature}} into a die to form it {{into the shape of}} a bullet. The other common manufacturing method is casting, which uses molten metals poured into a mold. Since metals expand when heated and contract when cooled, cast bullets must be cast with a mold slightly larger than the desired finish size, so that as the molten metal cools, it will harden at just the right point to shrink to the desired size. In contrast, <b>swaged</b> bullets, since they are formed at the temperature at which they will be used, can be formed in molds of the exact desired size. This means that <b>swaged</b> bullets are generally more precise than cast bullets. The swaging process also leads to fewer imperfections, since voids commonly found in casting would be pressed out in the swaging process. The swaging process in reference to cold flow of metals into bullets is the process not of squeezing the metals into smaller forms but rather pressing smaller thinner items to form into shorter and slightly wider shapes.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} of the rotary swager is the creeping spindle swaging machine where both the spindle and cage revolve in opposite directions, this prevents the production of fins between the dies where the material being <b>swaged</b> grows up {{the gap between the}} dies.|$|E
25|$|This is {{selected}} where the liner {{is required to}} mechanically hold back the movement of formation sand. There are many variants of openhole sand control, the three popular choices being stand-alone screens, openhole gravel packs (also known as external gravel packs, where a sized sand 'gravel' is placed as an annulus around the sand control screen) and expandable screens. Screen designs are mainly wire-wrap or premium; wire-wrap screens use spiral-welded corrosion-resistant wire wrapped around a drilled basepipe to provide a consistent small helical gap (such as , termed 12 gauge). Premium screens use a woven metal cloth wrapped around a basepipe. Expandable screens are run to depth before being mechanically <b>swaged</b> to a larger diameter. Ideally, expandable screens will be <b>swaged</b> until they contact the wellbore wall.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Ball <b>swaging</b> is a {{material}} process used {{to assemble a}} boss tower and an arm aperture. A <b>swage</b> ball is inserted into the boss tower to <b>swage</b> and couple two components. The <b>swage</b> ball has a larger diameter than an inner diameter of the boss tower, applies a compression force to the inner surface of the boss tower to hold both components together with adequate holding force and without damaging the boss tower. This study proposes a new design of the boss tower by relief ring width optimization. It reduces the arm tip deformation while avoiding HSA resonance and allows similar <b>swaging</b> quality by using single ball. The 3 -D FE method was used for analysis. The result analysis and experiment show boss tower deformation very similar. Although the variation of CTQ has been decreased, cleanliness has been improved. Moreover, non-circular arm aperture is able to reduce <b>swage</b> effect...|$|R

25|$|As swaging is a {{technique}} in which cold metal is formed over a grooved tool or swage, the term was adopted {{in the field of}} automotive styling to describe when two panels were brought together, an edge of one panel was <b>swaged</b> so to overlap the other to create the impression of one continuous surface.|$|E
25|$|Construction of all Pterodactyl {{aircraft}} was of similar material, predominantly anodized 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, braced with <b>swaged</b> steel cables {{supported by a}} king post, with a sewn Dacron sail for wing covering.

25|$|Handloaders {{have the}} choice to swage but most choose to {{purchase}} pre-made jacketed bullets, due to the obscure nature of swaging and the specialized, expensive equipment. The process of manufacturing a jacketed bullet is far more complex than for a cast bullet; first, the jacket must be punched from a metal sheet of precise thickness, filled with a premeasured lead core, and then <b>swaged</b> into shape with a high pressure press in multiple steps. This involved process makes jacketed bullets far more expensive on average than cast bullets. Further complicating this are the requirements for controlled expansion bullets (see terminal ballistics), which require a tight bond between the jacket and the core. Premium expanding bullets are, with match grade bullets, at the top tier in expense.|$|E
2500|$|In sawmills, a <b>swage</b> is used {{to flare}} large bandsaw or circle saw teeth, which {{increases}} {{the width of the}} cut, called the [...] A clamp attaches a mandrel and die to the tooth and the eccentric die is rotated, <b>swaging</b> the tip. A much earlier version of the same operation used a hardened, shaped <b>swage</b> die and a hand held hammer. Saw teeth formed in this way are sometimes referred to as being [...] "set". A finishing operation, shaping, cold works the points on the tooth sides to flats. It might be considered as a side <b>swage.</b> This slightly reduces the tooth width but increases the operating time between [...] "fittings". <b>Swaging</b> is a major advance over filing as the operation is faster, more precise and greatly extends the working life of a saw.|$|R

25|$|When a {{cartridge}} is fired, {{the internal}} pressure expands {{the case to}} fit the chamber in a process called obturation. To allow ease of chambering the cartridge when it is reloaded, the case is <b>swaged</b> back to size. Competition shooters, using bolt action rifles {{that are capable of}} camming a tight case into place, often resize only the neck of the cartridge, called neck sizing, as opposed to the normal full length resizing process. Neck sizing is only useful for cartridges to be re-fired in the same firearm, as the brass may be slightly oversized in some dimensions for other chambers, but the precise fit of case to chamber will allow greater consistency and therefore greater potential accuracy. Some believe that neck sizing will permit a larger number of reloads with a given case in contrast to full size resizing, although this is controversial. Semi-automatic rifles and rifles with SAAMI minimum chamber dimensions often require a special small base resizing die, that sizes further down the case than normal dies, and allows for more reliable feeding.|$|E

2500|$|An {{innovative}} feature {{which is}} more usually associated with 20th-century guns was what Armstrong called its [...] "grip", which was essentially a squeeze bore; the 6 inches of the bore at the muzzle end was of slightly smaller diameter, which centered the shell before it left the barrel {{and at the same}} time slightly <b>swaged</b> down its lead coating, reducing its diameter and slightly improving its ballistic qualities.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} use of swaging is to attach {{fittings}} to pipes or cables (also called wire ropes); the parts loosely fit together, and a mechanical or hydraulic tool compresses and deforms the fitting, creating a permanent joint.

40|$|Micro rotary <b>swaging</b> is a {{cold forming}} process for {{production}} of micro components with determined geometry and surface. It is also possible to change the microstructure of wires and hence the material properties. <b>Swaging</b> dies revolve around the work piece with an overlaid radial oscillation.

To test the influence of FSD on material properties by micro <b>swaging</b> a new method is investigated: the variation of the relative speed between the specimen and dies in infeed rotary <b>swaging.</b> During this specific process copper (C 11000) and steel (304  Alloy) wires with diameter d 0 = 1 [*]mm are formed. It is noticed that the mechanical characteristics such as ductility and strength differ from the characteristics after conventional <b>swaging.</b> Moreover this approach enables new possibilities to influence the geometry and the surface quality of wires.

40|$|Rotary <b>swaging</b> is an {{incremental}} cold forming {{process for the}} manufacture of cylindrical light weight components such as axles and steering spindles and has a wide spread use in the automotive industry. The advantage of rotary <b>swaging</b> is the optimal use of work piece material resources. This is due to material strengthening through strain hardening {{and the ability to}} manufacture hollow parts with variable wall thicknesses. However, main drawback is the need for an extensive lubrication to control tool wear, to discharge abrasive particles from the forming zone, and to provide adequate work piece surface quality. The subsequent, inevitable cleaning of the work pieces after manufacture leads to a significant increase of costs per unit. Thus, the development of rotary <b>swaging</b> towards a dry process layout is highly innovative both under economic and ecological aspects. The omission of lubricant provokes fundamentally changed tribological conditions in tool-work piece contact, leading to changes in process forces, increased abrasive and adhesive tool wear and reduced work piece quality. A robust, lubricant free rotary <b>swaging,</b> offering the same product quality as a conventional rotary <b>swaging</b> process with the use of lubricant, therefore implies the control of the modified tribological properties by methodologies substituting the tasks of the lubricant. This work shows an interdisciplinary approach for the development of dry rotary <b>swaging,</b> that comprises the FE modeling and simulation of the rotary <b>swaging</b> process for general process understanding and designing; the micro structuring of the rotary <b>swaging</b> tool surfaces for control of friction and process forces; and the development of tungsten doped a-C:H tool hard coatings for the reduction of abrasive and adhesive wear of the tools...|$|R
2500|$|When {{dealing with}} rubber {{components}} with mold bonded metal sleeves, swaging {{provides a more}} controlled and cost-effective alternative to 'shooting' the rubber part into a metal sleeve, where an intensive and less dependable secondary operation is needed to finish the product. [...] A metal can with a bonding component (such as phosphate) is painted to the inside diameter, and molten rubber is injected into the metal sleeve. This creates a product that when cooled may be <b>swaged</b> to the desired size. [...] The second {{reason for this is}} that the product is more reliable, and during the swaging process the rubber is more relaxed when the outside can to which the rubber is bonded has its diameter reduced, changing the springrate (K) values and damping coefficient (C) of the rubber. [...] After swaging, any inconsistencies in the metal and rubber have been minimized.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{cast lead}} bullets, {{intended}} for use with a gas check, will have a reduced diameter {{at the rear of}} the cast lead bullet, onto which the gas check can be <b>swaged</b> using a lubricating/resizing press.

[...] A lubricating/resizing press, which is a special purpose bullet processing press, can be either a standalone press dedicated to lubricating and resizing bullets, or can be an add-on to a reloading press, at the option of the handloader. [...] Not all handloaders resize cast lead bullets, although all handloaders do lubricate cast lead bullets. [...] An option to using a lubricating press is simply to coat the bullets with bullet lube, which can be done either with a spray, in a tumbler, in a plastic bowel with a liquid lube, in a tray with melted bullet lube, or even with a manual lubricating process.|$|E
2500|$|A final {{layer of}} adornments {{added to the}} helmet a crest, eyebrows, nose and mouth piece, and three dragon heads. A hollow iron crest ran {{across the top of}} the cap and {{terminated}} at front and back. It was made of [...] "D-sectioned" [...] tubing and consisted of two parts, an inverted [...] "U-shaped" [...] piece into which a [...] "flat bottom strip" [...] was placed. As no traces of solder remain, the crest may have been either forged or shrunk on to the cap. From either end of the crest extended an iron tang, to each of which was riveted a gilded dragon head. That on the front was made of cast bronze, while the one on the rear was made of [...] "a different alloy, and now consists largely of tin oxide." [...] A third dragon head, also of cast bronze, faced upwards on the front of the helmet and broke the plane between face mask and cap; its neck rested on the face mask, while under its eyes it was held to the cap by [...] "a massive rivet shank." [...] To either side of the neck projected a hollow cast bronze eyebrow, into each of which was inlaid parallel silver wires separated by niello. Terminal boar heads were gilded, as were the undersides of the eyebrows, where individual bronze cells held square garnets. The eyebrows were riveted on, both to the cap at their outer ends and to the tang of a nose and mouth piece which extended upwards underneath the neck of the dragon head. This tang was itself riveted to the cap, one of five attachment points for the cast bronze nose and mouth piece. Both sides of the nose featured [...] "two small round projecting plates," [...] connected by fluted and <b>swaged</b> strips, and concealing rivets. An inlaid strip of wire extended the length of the nasal ridge, next to which the [...] "background was punched down" [...] and filled with niello, leaving [...] "triangles in relief" [...] that were silvered. A tracer (a [...] "rather blunt chisel [...] [...] [...] used chiefly for outlining") was used to provide a grooved border on each side.

[...] This same pattern is repeated in vertical fashion on the moustache. The curve along the bevelled lower lip, in turn, repeats the circled pattern used on the nasal bridge.
