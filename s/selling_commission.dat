This success fee is calculated {{as a percentage of the}} actual selling price. For low-cost items, this <b>selling</b> <b>commission</b> can be up to 5% of the selling price. The commission on very high-cost items can be as low as 1%.Items listed in the Classifieds section are not subject to paying the success fee. Instead, the sellers who list their items in the Classifieds pay a flat listing fee.Items listed in any of the trading formats - auctions, buy-now or classifieds - can be “enhanced” (advertised on the home page and other sections of the site on a rotating basis) for a specified flat fee.|$|E
50|$|Irishman Robert Glover had the 200-ton, 18-gun, 60-man ship Resolution fitted out in Rhode Island around 1693, {{then headed}} to New York {{to obtain a}} privateering {{commission}} from Governor Benjamin Fletcher.

50|$|There were various {{regulations}} {{which required}} minimum lengths {{of service in}} a given rank, and restricted officers from selling or exchanging their commissions to avoid active service.

5000|$|Ziolkowski {{moved to}} New Britain, Connecticut, to begin {{life as a}} {{professional}} artist. He began to <b>sell</b> <b>commissioned</b> sculptures throughout New England and New York. In 1939, Ziolkowski {{was hired as a}} sculptor's assistant by Gutzon Borglum on his Mount Rushmore project. According to Lincoln Borglum, Gutzon's son, he was unhappy, having expected to be made the primary assistant. Instead, Lincoln was the primary assistant, and when Ziolkowski argued about his orders, Borglum fired him by telegram. A fistfight between Lincoln and Ziolkowski had to be broken up.|$|R

60|$|We do {{not sell}} our prime-ministership by Dutch auction; nor, on the decease of a bishop, {{whatever}} {{may be the}} general advantages of simony, do we (yet) offer his diocese to the clergyman who will take the episcopacy at the lowest contract. We (with exquisite sagacity of political economy!) do indeed <b>sell</b> <b>commissions,</b> but not, openly, generalships: sick, we do not inquire for a physician who takes less than a guinea; litigious, we never think of reducing six-and-eightpence to four-and-sixpence; caught in a shower, we do not canvass the cabmen, to find one who values his driving at less than a sixpence a mile.|$|R

2500|$|The {{reforming}} impetus, however, continued.

5000|$|In very liquid markets(like London or Paris) {{the buying}} agent fee is charged {{on top of}} the selling agent fee, so the buying agent service comes at an {{additional}} cost to the property buyer unless the buying agent is able to find a property that is not sold by an agent.

They maintained much of the Roman legacy; they repaired and extended Roman infrastructure, using it for irrigation, while introducing new agricultural practices and novel crops, such as sugar cane, rice, citrus fruit, apricots, and cotton.

25|$|Frederick {{resigned}} as Commander-in-Chief on 25 March 1809, {{as the result}} of a scandal caused by the activities of his latest mistress, Mary Anne Clarke. Clarke was accused of illicitly <b>selling</b> army <b>commissions</b> under Frederick's aegis. A select committee of the House of Commons enquired into the matter. Parliament eventually acquitted Frederick of receiving bribes by 278 votes to 196. He nevertheless resigned because of the high tally against him. Two years later, it was revealed that Clarke had received payment from Frederick's disgraced chief accuser, Gwyllym Wardle, and the Prince Regent reappointed the exonerated Frederick as Commander-in-Chief on 29 May 1811.|$|R
5000|$|In {{markets where}} the average selling time of a luxury {{property}} is high, buying agents tend to split the fee with the selling agent and therefore the service has no additional cost to the buyer. This happens because the selling agent typically prefers splitting his commission with the buying agent rather than waiting longer to find another buyer and sell the same property. In case the buying agent sources a private deal then they charge up to the <b>selling</b> agent <b>commission</b> (for instance the full 5% in the French Riviera [...] up to 2% in Spain.|$|R
