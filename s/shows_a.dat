5|$|In {{a similar}} way, xenon isotopic ratios such as 129Xe/130Xe and 136Xe/130Xe are a {{powerful}} tool for understanding planetary differentiation and early outgassing.

Since this isotope is generated by radioactive decay, the result may indicate that Mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere, possibly within the first 100 million years after the planet was formed. In another example, excess 129Xe found in carbon dioxide well gases from New Mexico is believed to be from the decay of mantle-derived gases from soon after Earth's formation.|$|E

40|$|Objectives : We {{performed}} {{this study}} {{in order to}} investigate the effects of Sedang-hwan(세당환(世糖丸)) on the diabetes mellitus. Methods : We injected a vein with 65 mg/kg of streptozotocin(STZ) on the rats. And then administered Sedang-hwan; 18. 7 mg/kg/day to sample groups and observed the weight and glucose level, insulin, C-peptide, triglyceride, albumin, T-protein, BUN(Blood Urea Nitrogen) and creatinine in blood. Results : 1. The sample groups <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> high supppressive effect of weight loss(P= 0. 002). 2. The sample groups'glucose level <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> effective in lowering level(P= 0. 001). 3. The sample groups <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> higher insulin level than control groups. 4. The sample groups <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> higher C-peptide level than control groups(P= 0. 001). 5. The sample groups' triglyceride level <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> effective in lowering level. 6. The sample groups <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> higher HDL-cholesterol level than control groups(p< 0. 001). 7. The sample groups <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> higher T-protein level than control groups(P= 0. 04). 8. The sample groups <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> higher albumin level than control groups(p< 0. 001). 9.
