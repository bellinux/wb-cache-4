50|$|The TasWireless {{site was}} first started in 1999. It {{started as a}} <b>spliter</b> group from TasLUG, the Tasmanian Linux Users Group. There was {{only a small number}} of people who were {{interested}} in wireless networking at this time, less than five each in Hobart and Launceston. A node database (http://www.nodedb.com) for Tasmanian regions was started, the mailing list was put on line, but due to the lack of practical experience and knowledge, very little happened. The cost of Wi-Fi cards and wireless access points was also a problem.In early 2002, a flood of cheap SkyNet Global 802.11b PC card cards flooded the market. These cards were liquidated stock and cost around A$50-60 each - the average retail price was still around A$200. A lot of these cards were shipped to the state and distributed (both by TasWireless admins and otherwise).|$|E
5000|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Elder Dragon Zhaitan in the games [...] "Personal Story", Season 1 of the [...] "Living World" [...] began. This story {{followed}} the player character joining a new group of characters to battle the enigmatic and insane Sylvari, Scarlet Briar, as she created strange enemy groups such as the Molten Alliance (a team-up between evil Charr and mole-like Dredge), the Toxic Alliance (a combination of lizard-like Krait and a <b>spliter</b> group from the Nightmare Court, a group of evil Sylvari), and the Aetherblades, steampunk sky pirates. As the player and their new group of heroes, made up of characters from each race, battle Scarlet, they also learn about her past and investigate what she could be searching for. The season culminated with Scarlet attacking the city of Lions Arch, landing a giant drill known as The Breachmaker {{in the center of the}} City. The player and their fellow heroes fought back, and killed Scarlet, but not before Lions Arch was left in ruins and the Breachmaker pierces a Ley Line, awakening a previously unknown jungle Elder Dragon, Mordremoth.|$|E

50|$|Keselowski {{started his}} season {{on a high}} note, leading the most laps of the Sprint Unlimited at Daytona. A late-race caution kept him from winning the race. Keselowski {{recovered}} from a bad pit stop to finish 9th. Keselowski didn't have any promising races at Daytona and Atlanta. However, {{he got his first}} Cup win of the season at Las Vegas, passing Kyle Busch with 6 laps to go.Keselowski also won the 10th race of the season, the GEICO 500 at Talladega. He started 7th, and led the most laps, 46 laps. He used the outside line to take the lead on lap 73, and swapped the lead with NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin multiple times, before blocking the three wide lines. When NASCAR came back to Daytona, Brad would have the best car all night and led the most laps to win the Coke Zero 400 and get his third win of the season. Following that, at Kentucky, he would get his 4th win of the season, and second consecutive win, after a lengthy last 70 laps trying to conserve fuel. Keselowski made it through {{the first round of the}} Chase, but in the second round he was eliminated. At Charlotte he would finish 7th, the next week at Kansas he was running in the top 10 but with 77 laps to go, Keselowski got loose and spun through the infield, tearing up his <b>spliter</b> and going to the garage and finished 38th. Coming to Talladega, Keselowski was in a must win situation, he started 2nd and had the dominant car leading 90 laps but with less than 50 laps remaining, he got a piece of debris on the grille and blew his engine going to the garage and finishing 38th for the 2nd week in a row. His teammate Joey Logano would go on to win the race. He would be eliminated from the 2nd round.|$|E
40|$|Key words: {{the static}} gas wave refrigerator; design parameter; {{oscillation}} characteristic; numerical study Abstract:In order {{to study the}} relation between the design parameters and the oscillation characteristic of the static gas wave refrigerator, the oscillation characteristic influenced by the design parameters including inlet pressure, width of the nozzle and the <b>spliter</b> location is analysed by means of numerical study. The results show that (1) the higher the inlet pressure is, the bigger the fluidic momentum and curvature radius of the fluidic attachment are. The further the attachment location is, the higher the controlling pressure at the port of the interconnection line is, while the smaller the switching time of the fluidic is; (2) When the width of nozzle increases, the fluidic is more unstable and the switching time is shorter and attachment location is obviously further; (3) with the decrease of the <b>spliter</b> location, the time to oscillate becomes shorter and the switching pressure becomes smaller...|$|E
40|$|The SMART (SpectroMicroscope for All Relevant Techniques) spectromicroscopy {{project is}} {{commonly}} regarded the worldwide most ambitious research project in surface science dealing with high lateral spectroscopic resolution by combination of an aberration corrected electron microscope with high-brillance synchrotron radiation. Aberration correction {{of the objective}} lens using a magnetic beam <b>spliter</b> and a tetrode {{as well as the}} corrected imaging energy filter may allow spectroscopic information from areas as small as 5 nm for many different modes of operation. Within the first 3 -years period the concept and construction of almost all major components has been completed, which may now be chracterized in detail. It is planned, that a simple version of the spectromicroscope (without aberration correction an energy filter) will be in operation at BESSY-II in spring 1999. Full operation of the complete instrument is scheduled for fall 2000. Within this project two more microspectroscopes were operated: the PISAM-II instrument has reached 600 nm resolution using an ellipsoidal mirror for refocusing, and the SpeLEEM (spectroscopic LEEM) +, operated by the Clausthal group at ELETTRA has reached 22 nm lateral resolution. Some test experiments have been performed with the SpeLEEM to evaluate the possibilities of such a multi-purpose instrument. (orig.)

50|$|The LEG {{was born}} on March 26, 2011 at the Faculty of Law of Santiago de Compostela, after a rupture of more than 150 militants of the Comités with this organization. The <b>spliters</b> accused the Comités of antidemocratic {{practices}} and of being totally controlled by the Galician People's Union. Among the <b>spliters</b> were the militants of youth organizations like Isca!. In April 2012 the first National Assembly of the organization takes place in Lugo. The same year, in May, the League was the most voted student organization in the University of Santiago de Compostela elections, gaining 20 of the 75 student seats in the University Council. In the 2013 elections in the University of A Coruña the LEG won 3 of the 60 student seats. In 2014 the League was again the most voted student organization in the University of Santiago de Compostela elections, gaining 24 of the 75 student seats in the University Council.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} requirements of turbofan engines demands a stability and transient capability beyond that {{associated with the}} past generations of gas turbine engines. The axial flow fan unit is most vulnerable to loading limitations due to the primary {{problems associated with the}} compression process, its sensitivity to inlet distortion and the difficulty to design for an overall optimum blade duty in a machine of wide radial blade loading distribution. The development of mathematical models with some capability of predicting the stable operating range of an axial flow fan has to overcome the difficulties associated with the modelling of the radially distinct flow regions and their dynamic interaction. ' The current investigation combined the available knowledge of one-dimensional models (based on the principles of conservation of mass, linear momentum and energy) with the assumptions of the parallel compressor theory, in order to develop a linearized system of equations for stability analysis (surge prediction). The stability conditions which emerged from this approach were applied on the experimentally derived characteristics of a low hub to tip ratio split flow fan in a manner which involved the modelling of the dynamic interaction of the inner and outer flow region of the fan. The development of the governing equations was achieved by applying one-dimensional flow analysis to the inner and outer section of the fan. Their interaction was modelled on the experimentally obtained radial movement of the splitter streamline and the discharge,static pressure 'radial distribution. The inner and outer region were treated as a lumped volume element search operating on a local masflow averaged total pressure rise characteristic and alternatively acting in conjunction with a common nozzle and separate nozzles. The experimental investigation was carried out on a low hub totipratio two-stage split flow fan(with the facility of independent bypass and core throttles) in order to examine the localised and overall performance of such a fan(and the staling processes involved) and to enable the application of the stability analysis. The influence of reducing the distance between the fan flow <b>spliter</b> and the last bladerowasal so investigated, «The mathematical mode 1 s predicted the point of dynamic instability within 4. 52 of the experimental observed mas flow rate and pressure is value...|$|E

50|$|UNA started {{talks with}} the Asturianist Party (PAS) to form a {{coalition}} for the Asturian elections of 1991 and the local elections {{of the same year}} after the failure of both parties in the previous general elections. This generated tensions within UNA, which led to a split of the sector that didn't want a coalition with the PAS in march 1990. The <b>spliters</b> founded two new political parties: Asturian Left and Andecha Astur. Finally, in 1991, PAS and UNA formed a coalition called Asturian Coalition (CA), that gained a seat in the Asturian elections of that year.

40|$|International audienceIndoor {{positioning}} {{appears to}} be a challenging topic and many techniques have been proposed these last ten years, ranging from High-Sensitivity GNSS to sensor networks, through Assisted-GNSS or WLAN based approaches. No ultimate solution seems yet to provide the answer to the problem, probably crucial of Location Based Services continuity from outdoor (where GNSS are such good candidates) to indoor positioning. Current works are mainly oriented towards hybridisation techniques. Recently, a new idea rose up consisting in the introduction of repealites (a shortcut between repeater and pseudolite). In such approach, an identical signal is transmitted from all the so-called repealites (as for repeaters), but with slight controlled delays for each transmitter. As a result, the correlation function, at the receiver end, is to exhibit N primary peaks in the case of N transmitting repealites. Interference problems and near-far effects have been addressed in previous papers and we are now interested in the most simple way to generate these N signals. The multipath problem is dealt with through the use of the SMICL (Short Multipath Insensitive Code Loop) design. Many different architectures are possible for the N delayed signals generation. Our approach consists of implementing a radio over fibre system: at the output of a one satellite signal generator a coupler is used to divide the signal in two parts. One part is assigned as the reference signal while the second part is converted in the optical domain, split and delayed. To this end, cascaded 1 X 2 optical <b>spliters</b> are used in order to define the (N- 1) required outputs. The desired delays are obtained using optical fibres of various lengths. In order to provide RF outputs, fibre to radio converters are used. The system that we have designed is presented the present article together with experimental results. In particular, a simple calibration method of the system is proposed to evaluate the accuracy of the delays and to define the best experimental settings to be used...|$|R
