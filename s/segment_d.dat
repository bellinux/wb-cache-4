50|$|When {{more than}} one bridge on a segment leads to a least-cost path to the root, the bridge with the lower bridge ID is used to forward {{messages}} to the root. The port attaching that bridge to the network segment is the designated port for the segment. In figure 4, there are two least cost paths from network <b>segment</b> <b>d</b> to the root, one going through bridge 24 and the other through bridge 92. The lower bridge ID is 24, so the tie breaker dictates that the designated port is the port through which network <b>segment</b> <b>d</b> is connected to bridge 24. If bridge IDs were equal, then the bridge with the lowest MAC address would have the designated port. In either case, the loser sets the port as being blocked.|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : (a) Our goal is {{to enable}} {{efficient}} processing of edges in a triangle mesh using adjacency primitives. (b) We select a minimal subset of triangles (blue) that covers all mesh edges. (c) Each remaining triangle (white) is assigned to a cover triangle (indicated by red <b>segments).</b> (<b>d)</b> We encode each triangle pair as a triangle-with-adjacency primitive, and order these primitives for vertex cache locality (cache hits in green, misses in red). This new representation reduces storage, bandwidth, and GPU computation, resulting in substantial gains {{for a variety of}} edge-processing techniques. Processing of mesh edges lies at the core of many advanced realtime rendering techniques, ranging from shadow and silhouette computations, to motion blur and fur rendering. We present a scheme for efficient traversal of mesh edges that builds on the adjacency primitives and programmable geometry shaders introduced in recent graphics hardware. Our scheme aims to minimize the number of primitives while maximizing SIMD parallelism. These objectives reduce to a set of discrete optimization problems on the dual graph of the mesh, and we develop practical solutions to these graph problems. In addition, we extend two existing vertex cache optimization algorithms to produce cache-efficient traversal orderings for adjacency primitives. We demonstrate significant runtime speedups for several practical real-time rendering algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} {{the development of}} vertebral artery in the 2010 enrolled pilot cadets, and provide a foundation for introducing vertebral artery ultrasound examination into inclusion criteria. Methods　The ultrasound findings of the vertebral artery in 722 pilot cadets, including its origin, shape, diameter and hemodynamic patterns, were retrospectively reviewed by two-dimensional and color Doppler ultrasound. The proportion of its congenital dysplasia was calculated and summarized. Results　Among the 722 pilot cadets, both the inner diameter of the initial <b>segment</b> (<b>D</b> 1) and the intervertebral <b>segment</b> (<b>D</b> 2) of left vertebral artery were wider than the right one (3. 624 ± 0. 017 mm vs 3. 489 ± 0. 018 mm, 3. 623 ± 0. 018 mm vs 3. 438 ± 0. 019 mm, P 0. 05). Among 5 persons showed both abnormal origin and shape, there were 2 cases in whom there was also small caliber.

As part of determining your tool requirements, you need to consider the types of tests you will be conducting, the characteristics of the devices you will be testing, and also the testing environment.
