At that time, this reaction was settled by the rats of the erythrocyte number (hemoglobin dosis) and the 1 -ascorbic dosis. Methemoglobin was only produced in the acidic side of reaction solution and the formation of the product with the absorption maximum at 670 mμ was promoted in the alkaline side of reaction solution. 3.

Because the inelastic stiffness of the sliding base during the <b>shaking</b> <b>process</b> is difficult to determine analytically, it is determined instead by experiment, on the basis of which an equivalent non-linear foundation model is established.

40|$|Off-lattice {{diffusion}} limited cluster aggregation simulations in {{two dimensions}} {{have been performed}} in a wide volume fraction range between 0. 001 and 0. 60. Starting from a system of 10 000 monomers with radius 0. 5, that follow Brownian trajectories, larger aggregates are generated by bond formation between overlapping aggregates. No rings {{are present in the}} nonaged structures. The influence of the initial monomer volume fraction on the fractal properties of the gels is studied and interpreted by calculation of small angle scattering structure factor patterns to find the fractal dimension. It is found that an increase of the volume fraction leads to the development of two distinct fractal regions. The fractal dimension at short length scale shows the diffusion limited cluster aggregation value of 1. 45 up to the correlation length, while the long range fractal dimension gradually increases from 1. 45 to 2. 00, the Euclidean dimension of the simulation space. It is shown that high volume fractions lead to changes in the local morphology of the monomers {{as a function of the}} volume fraction with corresponding changes in the high-q region of the structure factor pattern. A new method to simulate aging of aggregates at modest (low pH and temperature) reaction conditions by an off-lattice nonbreaking reorganization process, called shaking, is presented. The <b>shaking</b> <b>process</b> induces small changes in the local mass distribution, causing ring formation, but does not affect the radius of gyration of the aggregates. It is found that shaking leads to the formation of a polydisperse collection of new primary scatterers with a volume fraction dependent radius between 6 and 8 initial monomer radii. For low volume fractions the fractal dimension decreases approximately by 0. 2, due to the formation of the new primary scatterers. The <b>shaking</b> <b>process</b> induces changes in the fractal properties at length scales up to ~ 40. A simple theory that relates the volume fraction with the correlation length and describes the influence of aging on fractal properties such as monomer radius, fractal dimension, and correlation length is developed.

As in the atomic boron case, the 2 s → 3 s excitation is still relatively strong {{and due to}} configuration interaction effects dominates the 2 p subshell excitation to 3 p.

At this high velocity, excitation and ionization {{are expected to}} be well described by perturbation theories. High-resolution spectra for Auger electron emission, occurring in the energy range ∼ 50 – 90 eV and resulting from the deexcitation of singly or doubly excited states, were measured for various electron emission angles. Both single-K-shell excitation and double-K-shell vacancy production show strong dependences on the electron emission angle. Experimental anisotropy parameters for the 2 P states resulting from single-K-shell excitation are in good agreement with predictions of the Born approximation. In the case of double-K-shell-vacancy (i. e., hollow atom) production, the two K vacancies are found to come about mainly by ionization plus excitation of the atomic Li target giving rise to excited states in Li+. Strong line intensities from the 2 s 2 1 S and 2 s 3 s 3 S excited-state configurations are explained in terms of <b>shake</b> <b>processes,</b> providing direct spectral identification for the electron-electron (e-e) interaction in producing the doubly vacant K-shell configurations.

Afterwards, all the samples were tested and experimented for grain-size distribution using the standard procedures of BS 1377. Samples with coarser particles were analysed by using the dry sieve analysis which operated on a series of sorted BS sieves. On the other hand, hydrometer method was utilised to observe the finer samples. This test is important as to pinpoint the percentage of different grain sizes contained from BH 1 to BH 22, TW 1 to TW 4 and riverbed soil (right river, middle river and left river). On that note, it should be mentioned that the methods and analyses performed in this investigation closely followed the British Standard 1377 : Part 2 : 1990. Generally, the sieve analysis or mechanical analysis is commonly performed to ascertain the distribution of the coarser, large-sized particles, while the hydrometer method is employed to identify the distribution of the finer particles. As to get more accurate analysis, the study continued with the measurement of the initial mass of the soil in the container before it was soaked in distilled water for 24  h. After that, the soil was washed using 63 -µm sieve until the water was clear.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The current {{technique}} of human pancreas digestion for islet isolation relies on selective distribution of collagenase delivered via the pancreatic duct to produce digestion and removal of peri-acinar fibrous tissue. However, the collagenase has relatively {{little effect on}} the interlobular fibrous tissue, which must therefore be broken down by mechanical means within the digestion chamber so as to release the contained acini and islets. The current way of achieving this in the Ricordi chamber is to place five or six stainless steel balls within the chamber and shake vigorously. The shaking presumably breaks down the interlobular fibrous tissue by a combination of shear force induced by the movement of tissue through the <b>shaking</b> <b>process,</b> assisted by numerous blows from the steel balls. Intuitively, one would expect some islets would be destroyed rather than released by such a battering. METHODS: In an attempt to improve the efficiency of islet isolation we have designed a new digestion/filtration chamber that consists of a glass cylinder, sealed with Teflon plates holding in mesh filters at each end, secured in place by a central threaded tie-rod and external knurled nuts. A ring-shaped piston within the cylinder can be pushed up and down the travel by two rods passing out through sealed ports in the Teflon disk at one end and connected to an external handle. The handle is used to gently push the piston up and down the travel of the cylinder, which pushes the fluid and tissue through the central lumen of the ring-piston. A series of hooks attached to the central tie-rod catch the fibrous strands of the passing tissue; the shearing forces produced cause disruption by a process thought to be similar to teasing the tissue apart with fine forceps. RESULTS: A series of initial experiments with human pancreas showed the prototype to be too large, causing temperature control problems, and a redesigned smaller chamber was produced, maintaining the crucial design features. Experience processing five human pancreata has now demonstrated that in three of five pancreata the new chamber produced a good yield (> 200, 000 I. E.) of remarkably well separated and intact islets, the entire dispersion process being under 1 hour. However, in two isolations the collagenase digestion was poor, with few free islets. A copy of the new chamber (reserved for porcine work only) has been produced, as well as a copy of the Ricordi chamber. We have confirmed that the new chamber can isolate porcine islets in large numbers (> 5000 islets/g pancreas [n = 2], but note that pig islets are small). CONCLUSION: These preliminary studies are sufficiently encouraging to justify further direct comparison with the Ricordi chamber for the purpose of animal and human islet isolation...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} optical {{emission}} from single semiconductor quantum dots coupled to the optical modes of photonic crystal nanocavities. For dots {{that are both}} spectrally and spatially coupled, auto-correlation measurements reveal efficient single photon generation, with a drastically reduced lifetime due to the Purcell-effect. However, the multi-photon emission probability is enhanced compared to the same QD transition when it is detuned from the cavity mode by controlled N_ 2 -deposition. This indicates {{the presence of an}} emission background that is shown {{to be related to the}} dot using photon cross-correlation spectroscopy. Photon temporal correlations persist even for large spectral detunings beyond Δλ∼- 10 nm, excluding the intrinsic QD continuum and phonon mediated processes as being responsible for the cavity mode emission background.
