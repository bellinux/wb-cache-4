25|$|El Shehaby {{lost his}} first match to Israel's Or Sasson, {{but refused to}} bow or shake hands with him, {{resulting}} to a loud jeer from the crowd. When Sasson extended his hand to shake after the match, El Shehaby backed away, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The referee called El Shehaby back to the mat and obliged him to bow, at which point El Shehaby gave a quick nod of his head. El Shehaby's conduct was widely condemned as unsportsmanlike. It is unclear what potential punishment El Shehaby or Egyptian judo as a whole could face, but his hopes of medaling were dashed regardless due to Sasson's decisive performance in the quarterfinals.|$|E
500|$|Ali Suliman, who {{previously}} collaborated with Berg on the 2007 film The Kingdom, plays Mohammad Gulab, an Afghan villager; Alexander Ludwig plays Navy SEAL Machinist's Mate Shane Patton. Marcus Luttrell {{appears in the}} film in an uncredited role. He first appears as a SEAL teammate who lightheartedly hazes Patton, then during a briefing scene where he is seen <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> when the Rules of Engagement are being explained, and later {{as one of the}} servicemen who perishes when a CH-47 Chinook is shot down. Luttrell said of the latter scene, [...] "I {{was on the other side}} of the mountain when those guys came to help me, so getting to die on the helicopter in the movie was a very powerful moment for me." ...|$|E
500|$|The Brute Man was {{developed}} by Universal Pictures Company, Inc. in the later years of their successful production of horror films, including Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931) and The Mummy (1932). While those films were great critical and financial successes, The Brute Man was filmed during what was widely considered the low point of the studio's horror film period. It was produced by Ben Pivar and directed by Jean Yarbrough, both of whom had worked on House of Horrors and many other horror films for Universal over the years. The Brute Man was filmed in 13 days, during November 1945. The flashback scenes—which depict how Hal Moffet became disfigured and ultimately became the Creeper—were all shot {{on the final day}} of filming. Jane Adams said Hatton's acromegaly was becoming progressively worse by the time The Brute Man was filmed, and it made acting difficult for him. Hatton had trouble remembering his lines, focusing on his performance, and responding to the other actors. Hatton occasionally appears confused even on screen, like during one scene where he says [...] "yes" [...] while <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> [...] "no." [...] Adams called him a friendly and thoughtful man, but called him [...] "so pathetic to work with [...] almost autistic".|$|E

500|$|Joseph Parkes, Lord Wilton and William Rathbone {{were the}} first to reach Huskisson. They found that a wheel had passed over his right calf and thigh, leaving his knee itself untouched. A flap of skin on his upper leg had been cut back, exposing the muscles, and the exposed arteries had not been severed but were flattened, pulsing with Huskisson's heartbeat. The damaged leg shook uncontrollably. Observers noted that Huskisson {{did not appear to be}} in pain, and instead lay {{watching}} the leg shake. Huskisson shouted [...] "This is the death of me". Parkes attempted to reassure him, but Huskisson replied [...] "Yes, I am dying, call Mrs Huskisson". A man threw his coat over William Huskisson's leg to spare Emily Huskisson from seeing the extent of his injuries, and she was helped from the carriage in which she had been sitting. In hysterics, she attempted to throw herself onto Huskisson, but was restrained by fellow passengers as Lord Wilton applied a makeshift tourniquet he had made using handkerchiefs and an elderly passenger's walking stick. Other passengers ripped the door of a nearby railway storeroom from its hinges, to serve as a makeshift stretcher. Huskisson was lifted onto the door, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and saying [...] "Where is Mrs Huskisson? I have met my death, God forgive me." [...] (Garfield, writing in 2002, gives his words as [...] "This is my death, God forgive me".) ...|$|E
500|$|Göring was the second-highest-ranking Nazi {{official}} tried at Nuremberg, behind Reich President (former Admiral) Karl Dönitz. The prosecution levelled {{an indictment}} of four charges, including a charge of conspiracy; waging a war of aggression; war crimes, including the plundering and removal to Germany {{of works of art}} and other property; and crimes against humanity, including the disappearance of political and other opponents under the Nacht und Nebel (Night and Fog) decree; the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war; and the murder and enslavement of civilians, including what was at the time estimated to be 5,700,000 Jews. Not permitted to present a lengthy statement, Göring declared himself to be [...] "in the sense of the indictment not guilty". The trial lasted 218 days; the prosecution presented their case from November through March, and Göring's defencethe first to be presentedlasted from 8 to 22 March. The sentences were read out on 30 September 1946. Göring, forced to remain silent while seated in the dock, communicated his opinions about the proceedings using gestures, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> or laughing. He constantly took notes and whispered with the other defendants, and tried to control the erratic behaviour of Hess, who was seated beside him. During breaks in the proceedings, Göring tried to dominate the other defendants, and he was eventually placed in solitary confinement when he attempted to influence their testimony. Göring told American psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn that the court was [...] "stupid" [...] to try [...] "little fellows" [...] like Funk and Kaltenbrunner instead of letting Göring take all the blame on himself. He also claimed that he had never heard of most of the other defendants before the trial.|$|E
2500|$|The much-anticipated New York Times {{article on}} the Bogdanov scandal has appeared. Alas, it suffers from the usual journalistic conceit that a proper {{newspaper}} article must cover a [...] "controversy". There must be two sides to the controversy, and the reporter's job is to elicit quotes from both parties and present them side-by-side. Almost inevitably, this [...] "balanced" [...] approach sheds no light on the matter, and leaves the reader <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> [...] "There they go again..." ...|$|E

2500|$|His ready wit on {{the field}} saw him held in great affection, but his {{reputation}} was always underpinned by respect, as {{he was one of}} the most accomplished umpires of his day. In one match a batsman who had been celebrating a special event the previous evening was rapped on the pad by a ball. At once the bowler asked: [...] "How is he?" [...] Said Alec, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> sadly: [...] "He's not at all well, and he was even worse last night." [...] Occasionally the joke went against Alec. In a game in 1948 he turned down a strong appeal by the Australian touring team. A little later a dog ran onto the field, and Sid Barnes captured it, carried it to Skelding and said: 'Here you are. All you want now is a white stick!' ...|$|E
2500|$|President Barack Obama {{stated that}} the {{decision}} [...] "gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington – while undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates". Obama later elaborated in his weekly radio address saying, [...] "this ruling strikes at our democracy itself" [...] and [...] "I can't think of anything more devastating to the public interest". On January27, 2010, Obama further condemned the decision during the 2010 State of the Union Address, stating that, [...] "Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests – including foreign corporations – to spend without limit in our elections. Well, I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities." [...] On television, the camera shifted {{to a shot of}} the SCOTUS judges in the front row {{directly in front of the}} President while he was making this statement, and Justice Samuel Alito was frowning, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> side to side while mouthing the words [...] "Not true".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the film}} Lone Survivor (2013), Luttrell was portrayed by actor Mark Wahlberg. Luttrell makes a {{significant}} cameo appearance (uncredited) {{in at least}} three scenes in the film and is present in other scenes, as well. He first appears as one of the SEALs, referred to as [...] "Frankie" [...] by Lt. Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), lightheartedly hazing rookie SEAL Shane Patton (Alexander Ludwig) before the mission, jokingly giving Shane his first mission or [...] "op" [...] of cleaning the table, supplemented by knocking over a drink. His second appearance is during the presentation of the rules of engagement for Operation Red Wings where he can be seen <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at the rules governing return fire. [...] This scene is significant. [...] In his book, Lone Survivor, Marcus explains extensively how these rules created substantial risk for the forces in Afghanistan. His third appearance is later in the film as one of the 16 special operators aboard the doomed Chinook helicopter sent to rescue Luttrell and his team. The camera stops on him and several real-life SEALs just before the Taliban's rocket-propelled grenade comes through the open rear bay door and impacts the Chinook's interior, killing everyone aboard. [...] "I {{was on the other side}} of the mountain when those guys came to help me," [...] Luttrell says of his real-life experience, [...] "so getting to die on the helicopter in the movie was a very powerful moment for me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 2006, Pietersen {{played in}} the three Tests against India, which England drew 1–1. In the first innings on 15, another rash shot brought his downfall. He pulled a ball from Sreesanth onto his stumps. His 87 in the second innings of the first match came during England's {{acceleration}} period, helping push the required target over 300. England then declared overnight, and India successfully batted out the final day to secure a draw. This half-century was followed by another in the first innings of the second Test. Again, he gave his wicket away on 64 when he offered Munaf Patel a return catch. The second innings was not so good, facing just 13 balls before being given out caught behind off a Harbhajan Singh delivery. The unhappy Pietersen was later fined 30 percent of his match fee for <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and showing signs of dissent. [...] "Replays demonstrated that the ball that had dismissed him had brushed his forearm, not his glove, before ballooning up {{into the hands of}} Rahul Dravid at slip. But umpire Darrell Hair gave him out for 4 as England collapsed on the fourth afternoon." [...] Pietersen posted a score of 39 in the first innings of the third test before he got a beauty from Sreesanth which moved and took the edge of the bat before being caught by Mahendra Singh Dhoni. In the second innings, he posted 7 again being caught and bowled, this time by Anil Kumble via a leading edge. Despite a quiet match for him, England won comfortably after a dismal 100 all out in India's second visit to the crease.|$|E
