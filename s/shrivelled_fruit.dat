40|$|Plant age and size, {{seasonal}} growth patters {{and crop}} load, among other factors, {{have been reported}} to decrease the usefulness of trunk diameter variation (TDV) derived indices as water stress indicators in olive trees. Our hypothesis, however, is that indices derived from TDV records in old, big olive trees are sensitive enough to detect levels of water stress in trees of orchards under deficit irrigation that, although severe, are below the threshold for <b>fruit</b> <b>shrivelling.</b> This is of importance for the production of good quality oils, since <b>fruit</b> <b>shrivelling</b> may affect oil quality. The aim of this work was to assess different TDV-derived indices as water stress indicators in 40 -year-old 'Manzanilla' olive trees with heavy crop load. We derived the maximum daily shrinkage (MDS), daily growth (DG) and daily recovery (DR) from TDV records taken during the 2008 dry season both in well-irrigated FAO trees and in deficit-irrigated RI trees. Measurements of volumetric soil water content ([theta]v), leaf water potential ([Psi]l), stomatal conductance (gs), net CO 2 assimilation rate (A), water and oil accumulation in the fruits and yield parameters were made for both treatments. The trunks did not grow during the experimental season, either in the FAO or RI trees, likely because of the heavy crop load. Therefore, DG was useless as water stress indicator. For MDS and DR, which were responsive to the increase of the trees' water stress, we calculated the variability, quantified by the coefficient of variation (CV), the signal intensity (SI) and the sensitivity (SI/CV) values. In addition, we derived reference equations for irrigation scheduling from the relationships between MDS values in the FAO trees and main meteorological variables. Values both of SI-MDS and SI-DR were steady until September 9, despite of increasing differences in [theta]v between treatments from early in the dry season. The [Psi]l vs [theta]v values showed an outstanding capacity of the RI trees to take up water from the drying soil, and the [Psi]l vs gs values showed a near-isohydric behaviour of those deficit-irrigated trees. These results explain, at least in part, the lack of response of MDS and DR on that period. Both SI-MDS and SI-DR peaked {{for the first time on}} September 9, 16 days before the appearance of <b>fruit</b> <b>shrivelling.</b> Our results suggest that using TDV-derived indices as water stress indicators for irrigation scheduling in old olive orchards with medium to low plant densities, i. e. with large root zones, may be useless in case the irrigation strategy is aimed at keeping the soil close to field capacity. Nevertheless, the MDS and DR indices may be useful indicators for the avoidance of <b>fruit</b> <b>shrivelling</b> in deficit irrigated olive orchards for the production of good quality oil. Reliable reference equations for scheduling irrigation with the signal intensity approach were obtained from the regression of MDS values vs the daily maximum values of both the air temperature and the vapour pressure deficit of the air.

40|$|Passionfruit (Passiflora edulis, Sims, {{cultivar}} “Sweetheart”) {{were subject}} to gamma irradiation at levels suitable for phytosanitary purposes (0, 150, 400 and 1000 Gy) then stored at 8 °C and assessed for fruit quality and total ascorbic acid concentration after one and fourteen days. Irradiation at any dose (≤ 1000 Gy) did not affect passionfruit quality (overall fruit quality, colour, firmness, <b>fruit</b> <b>shrivel,</b> stem condition, weight loss, total soluble solids level (TSS), titratable acidity (TA) level, TSS/TA ratio, juice pH and rot development), nor the total ascorbic acid concentration. The length of time in storage affected some fruit quality parameters and total ascorbic acid concentration, with longer storage periods resulting in lower quality fruit and lower total ascorbic acid concentration, irrespective of irradiation. There was no interaction between irradiation treatment and storage time, indicating that irradiation did not influence the effect of storage on passionfruit quality. The {{results showed that the}} application of 150, 400 and 1000 Gy gamma irradiation to “Sweetheart” purple passionfruit did not produce any deleterious effects on fruit quality or total ascorbic acid concentration during cold storage, thus supporting the use of low dose irradiation as a phytosanitary treatment against quarantine pests in purple passionfruit...|$|R
40|$|General Description. —Bejuco de paralejo, {{also known}} as brjuco de sopla and aile à ravet, is a woody vine or {{climbing}} shrub that may extend 15 m laterally and reach 10 m into the crowns of trees, with stems as thick as 8 cm. The root system is superficial, especially roots arising from layered stems. The stems are cylindrical, smooth, and have rings at the nodes. The wood is moderately hard and has growth rings. The stems tend to be long and little branched except near the extremities. The simple, opposite ovate or elliptical leaves have petioles 1 to 1. 5 cm long, and blades 5 to 17 cm long and 5 to 8 cm broad, rounded to cordate at the base {{and pointed at the}} tip. Inflorescences are panicles of four-flowered cymes flanked by leaves of reduced size that often <b>shrivel</b> as the <b>fruits</b> mature.

40|$|The {{performance}} of California kiwifruit packed using solid liners, perforated liners, and micro-perforated liners on {{the rate of}} initial cooling time, water loss, and quality attributes after shipping was evaluated under controlled laboratory and commercial conditions. Controlled cooling tests using a portable cooling tunnel indicated an important cooling time reduction (reaching 7 / 8 cooling time) without affecting quality when perforated liners were used instead of solid ones. The use of these vented box liners will result in direct energy savings to packinghouses proportional to the reduction in cooling times. Also, shorter cooling times will allow scheduling operations for the off-peak utility periods. Fruit quality attributes such as fruit firmness, soluble solids, and titratable acidity were not affected {{by any of the}} box liner treatments. Kiwifruit weight loss depended on the box liner vented area (V. A.) and storage temperature. After 18 weeks at 0 oC kiwifruit packed in the solid (0 % V. A.), perforated (0. 6 % V. A.) and micro-perforated (1. 2 % V. A.) box liners had water losses of 0. 7, 2. 4 and 5. 2 %, respectively. <b>Fruit</b> <b>shrivel</b> was only observed on fruit packaged in the micro-perforated liners when water loss exceeded 4. 0 % in relation to the harvest fresh weight.

40|$|The {{effect of}} two deficit {{irrigation}} (DI) strategies on fruit and oil production and quality in a 12 -year-old ‘Arbequina’ olive orchard with 238 trees ha− 1 was evaluated. The T 1 treatment was a sustained DI regime (65 % ETc, 2 – 3 irrigation events per week). The T 2 treatment was a low-frequency DI (increasing stress/rewatering cycles, which consisted in withholding irrigation until <b>fruit</b> <b>shrivelling</b> and then applying a recovery irrigation providing {{the same amount}} of water that supplied in T 1 for that period). As compared to full irrigation, both strategies reduced fruit production and increased the variability of fruit ripening, but favoured oil extraction. Free acidity, peroxide value, K 232, K 270 and sensory quality of oil were not affected by DI. Furthermore, carotenoid, chlorophyll, phenol, and oleic contents increased. The greatest phenol content and bitterness index were found in oil from T 2 trees. Later harvesting caused sensory quality and tocopherol losses, although the oil synthesized in DI olives increased.

40|$|Under Mark Latham, Labor can {{reclaim the}} suburbs that Paul Keating lost, argues David Burchell IT’S the result the country’s cartoonists were dreaming of: Mark Latham as Labor leader! After the dour and hapless Simon Crean, who had them gnawing on their pencil-heads, and the earnest but ineffectual Kim Beazley, who had them nodding {{off on their}} easels, the rambunctious lad from Liverpool will put a spring into their step. In the inner-city cafes of Melbourne and Sydney, on the other hand, there will be apoplexy. That Godzilla of the aspirationals, that Philistine in the groves of ‘alternative’ culture, is on the march. In the Canberra press gallery, no doubt, there {{is a mixture of}} exaltation and bafflement - a sense that Labor is embarking on a truly {{excellent}} adventure, but also that Labor’s caucus must have rocks in its collective head to take such a wild punt. So here goes. Among the exaltation, puzzlement and gloom, I’ll attempt a sober explanation of why the election of Latham as leader {{could turn out to be}} a perfectly sensible, even prudent, move for the Labor Party. And yes, smile if you will. Labor’s travails began during the leadership of Paul Keating, a man of many talents, but whose electoral nous left much to be desired. His bold vision of leading Australia into Asia as a cosmopolitan, outward-looking hub of world commerce and culture - a vision that intoxicated liberal-minded intellectuals - had precisely the opposite effect on many ordinary suburban Australians. To many ordinary punters, it gave the decided impression that Labor had become the party of those new global citizens, the urban professional classes - of the kinds of folks with laden bookcases and season opera tickets who are prone to equate world music with broad-mindedness, and fusion food with cross-cultural sensitivity. Since 1996, Labor has been struggling, without a great deal of success, to eradicate that legacy. After the 2001 election, where Labor did catastrophically in the outer suburbs, Crean made a pilgrimage to southwestern Sydney, to atone for his party’s perceived sins. Despite his honest intentions, it turned out to be something of a one-off. Labor’s emotional conflicts have had nothing to do with the burdens and travails of suburban Australia. Instead, they’ve been vented over grand moral issues such as asylum-seekers and the war in Iraq, where the consciences of middle Australia and the average Labor party member have diverged spectacularly. In comparison, Labor’s policy development over mundane issues such as health and social security has appeared uninspired and passionless. It’s not true to say that Labor is a policy-free zone. In reality, Labor has been hard at work developing policy (particularly in health), and has had some successes. Labor’s real problem isn’t lack of a political soul - that’s in there, somewhere. The problem is Labor’s lack of a political personality and of the capacity to project that personality where it needs to be seen and heard. Symbolism matters in politics - indeed, it matters more than policy, in some respects. Nobody in their right mind sits down to read party manifestos, or to watch question time on TV. The key task of the party leader isn’t so much to lead as much as to project the political personality of their party. It’s a matter of direction rather than detail. Crean’s limitations in this respect have been obvious enough not to require further comment. Labor’s other potential leaders, though, have personality issues of a similar order. Kevin Rudd is clearly a decent man and an intelligent politician. But he looks and sounds like a big-city lawyer and has the kind of patrician knowingness in his air that is poison to those who feel as if they’re outsiders, the forgotten ones. He’s forensic in his criticisms, but in a courtroom kind of way. Beazley is obviously a likeable and humane individual. Yet after two decades as a parliamentary journeyman he exudes the unmistakable aroma of soft leather seats and mouldy manila folders. There may be fire in his belly, but it appears to the outsider more like the embers in a cosy Canberra fireplace. When he tries to summon up genuine political passion, the effect seems forced. Latham, on the other hand, has been busy shaping his public personality for years now to meet Labor’s present personality crisis. It’s combative, to be sure, but with a purpose. He’s defended suburbanites against the charge that they’re all racists at heart. He’s promised to tackle poverty with the kinds of self-enabling strategies that most suburban Australians have traditionally preferred to the begging bowl. And describing striving middle-Australia as ‘aspirational’ was a small stroke of genius, given the stultifying preoccupation of the ideological Left with the patronage of the poor, seen as the deserving objects of state charity. This is the territory on which Labor has to be seen to fight if it’s to win back the Victa and the Hills Hoist. Of course, that personality could yet be Latham’s undoing. Some fear that Latham the leader will be unable to restrain his irascible temper or his schoolyard tongue. The opposite might be closer to the truth. Latham may find it harder to maintain that winning air of devil-may-care frankness with the burden of leadership on his shoulders. Bob Hawke’s wit seemed to evaporate over his prime ministership, like a slowly <b>shrivelling</b> <b>fruit.</b> Likewise, the former British Opposition leader Neil Kinnock was a renowned wise-cracker prior to his elevation. As Labour leader, on the other hand, Kinnock was about as boisterous as Eeyore. Latham’s harder task may not be to tame his tongue, but rather to keep it barbed, and to keep the barbs on target. As a student of Labor history he must be well aware of the heavy responsibility on his shoulders. The great trick of political oratory, as one of its finest ancient Roman practitioners well knew, is to project an impression of easy spontaneity in utterance, while measuring every word. We’re about to find out whether Latham is up to that rather demanding task.

40|$|New Zealand is the world’s third biggest {{producer}} of kiwifruit, with 94 % of the kiwifruit produced exported (NZ $ 1. 0 bn in 2014). Forced-air cooling of the produce (from the harvest temperature of about 20 °C to near storage temperature of 0 °C) immediately after harvest improves storage potential and maintains produce quality before transportation to market. The {{design of the}} kiwifruit packaging system influences the rate of cooling and temperature achieved, mainly by affecting the airflow within and throughout the package. The typical kiwifruit package contains 10. 5 kg of fruit and consists of a cardboard box and polyliner bag to prevent the loss of moisture and <b>fruit</b> <b>shrivelling.</b> Individual boxes are assembled onto pallets (10 boxes to a pallet layer, 10 layers high) Open areas or vents (in the box) facilitate cooling by allowing cool air to enter and circulate throughout the package. In forced-air cooling pallets are assembled into double rows with an aisle between the rows. Cool air is sucked through the pallets by a fan in the aisle, cooling the fruit and warming the air. The air is then either blown or ducted to the refrigeration system to be re-cooled. The polyliner keeps the local humidity high near the fruit, preventing weight loss due to evaporative cooling, but, {{as a barrier to}} direct fruit to air contact, slows the cooling rate. This project investigated the impact of operating conditions and package design on the cooling performance in such systems. A numerical model was developed (a CFD model implemented using the Fluent CFD software) that describes and predicts the temperature profiles of palletised kiwifruit packages undergoing forced-air cooling. The capability of the model to predict the fruit temperatures in each package was quantitatively validated against experimental data. The numerical model was able to predict temperature profiles within experimental error bars over 14 h of cooling. The numerical model was used to determine the operating point (in terms of pressure drop and flowrate across the pallet) to ensure rapid cooling of the produce without incurring excessive operational costs due to the power requirements. Results from both experimental work and the numerical model informed that there was an effective limit to the volumetric flowrate of 0. 243 L kg- 1 s- 1 : flowrates in excess of the limit had no or little effective benefit. This threshold flowrate is below the typical range recommended in industry for the forced-air cooling of non-polylined horticultural produce, which is 0. 5 – 2. 0 L kg- 1 s- 1. The numerical model demonstrated that the overall cooling performance (cooling rate, uniformity, power consumption and pallet throughput per week) can be improved by controlling the airflow distribution between the fastest and slowest cooling kiwifruit packages. An alternative design that channels cool air through the pallet towards the slowest cooling packages, located {{at the back of the}} pallet, by using two package designs in the same pallet, was presented. At 0. 243 L kg- 1 s- 1 it was found that the pressure drop and power required to achieve equivalent cooling rates with the new design was reduced (by 24 % each) compared to the conventional design. Additionally, at the half-cooling time the cooling uniformity was improved by 19 %. The key features of the new design can be expected to be applicable for the cooling of horticultural produce involving an inner packaging liner...|$|R
