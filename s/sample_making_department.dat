5000|$|<b>Department</b> of Film <b>Making,</b> <b>Department</b> of Cinema Studies, Department of Multimedia, Department of Animation, Department of Broadcasting ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Making</b> <b>departments</b> {{responsible}} in their usage, e.g., refrain from asking for resources {{they are not}} going to use ...|$|R
5000|$|Test fixtures, {{specimen}} holding jaws, {{and related}} <b>sample</b> <b>making</b> equipment are {{called for in}} many test methods.|$|R
30|$|Nevertheless, {{despite the}} {{different}} height of this slab <b>sample</b> <b>making</b> the measurements trickier, the emissivity variations become significant for θ ≥  40 °.|$|R
50|$|Kongsberg {{computer-controlled}} {{cutting and}} creasing tables for short-run production and <b>sample</b> <b>making</b> in packaging, signage and display markets. Esko owns the manufacturer, {{which is based}} in the town of Kongsberg in Norway.|$|R
50|$|From June 2009 the Research Councils {{reported}} to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills as the making of higher education and innovation policy (from the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills) was merged back with business policy <b>making</b> (<b>Department</b> for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform).|$|R
50|$|Main {{enterprise}} {{is located in}} Paneriai (Vilnius), the capital of Lithuania, where are <b>samples</b> <b>making,</b> CAD (designing), CAM (cutting) departments and nine specialized sewing workshops. The Company has six affiliates in other cities in Lithuania.|$|R
50|$|Incorporated in 1933, the Telsen Electric Company Ltd were {{manufacturers}} of wireless broadcast receivers, components and construction kits. They had a cabinet <b>making</b> <b>department</b> turning out polished furniture into which wireless receivers were built, mainly {{from their own}} components. They were also buying Bakelite cases from Edwin Elliot in Birmingham.|$|R
5000|$|Policy <b>making</b> in <b>Department</b> of Telecommunications and Department of Posts.|$|R
50|$|Variational Bayesian {{learning}} {{is based on}} probabilities. There is a chance that an approximation is performed with mistakes, damaging further data representations. Another downside pertains to complicated or corrupted data <b>samples,</b> <b>making</b> it difficult to infer a representational pattern.|$|R
5000|$|Security violation. It {{can be an}} {{integrity}} violation, if it aims to get malicious samples misclassified as legitimate; or an availability violation, if {{the goal}} is to increase the misclassification rate of legitimate <b>samples,</b> <b>making</b> the classifier unusable (e.g., a denial of service).|$|R
5000|$|The legendary filmmaker has {{introduced}} many famous personalities in TFI. He has given chance to LV Prasad in his movie ‘Tenali Ramakrishna’ and in ‘Gharana Donga’. BN Reddy, KV Reddy and Kamalakara Kameswara Rao {{have done their}} apprenticeship along with H M Reddy in various Film <b>Making</b> <b>departments.</b> His philosophy was [...] "Believe in you not the Stars".|$|R
50|$|The {{program is}} offered in {{collaboration}} with ISG in Switzerland. Among the courses offered are the Department of Production Engineering Diploma In Manufacturing Engineering (Tool and Die Design) and Diploma In Manufacturing Engineering (Tool and Die <b>Making).</b> <b>Department,</b> Industrial Automation Industrial Automation Diploma in Information Technology (IT) and Diploma in Industrial Automation (Mechatronics). The courses take three years and are full-time.|$|R
50|$|Engineers and {{designers}} {{start with the}} needs of the particular project: cost constraints, machinery capabilities, product characteristics, logistics needs, applicable regulations, consumer needs, etc. Often designs are made with Computer Aided Design programs connected to automated <b>sample</b> <b>making</b> tables. Several design and construction options might be considered.|$|R
5000|$|Communist Party and {{its core}} {{decision}} <b>making</b> <b>departments,</b> such as Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Politburo of the Communist Party of China, Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China, Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, Political and Legislative Affairs Committee of the Communist Party of China, Organization Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee ...|$|R
50|$|In 1947, a {{gymnasium}} was built. In 1949, {{an outdoor}} athletic field was developed near the old Perdue plant, which benefited both {{the high school}} and the town of Robersonville. In 1952, an all-purpose home <b>making</b> <b>department</b> was built along with a foyer for the RHS gymnasium. This allowed the library to expand in the main building of the high school. Special Education was also added that year.|$|R
40|$|A curated {{screening}} of films {{from the film}} <b>making</b> <b>department</b> in the School of Performance and Screen Studies in the Faculty of Arts and Social Science: colleagues, PhD students and graduates, BA Film and MA film making students' work that show {{the intersection of the}} process of film making and family life. This event will provides an output to establish the convergence in the practice of the students and staff of the film <b>making</b> <b>department</b> in PASS and provide a forum for discussion on the reciprocal relationship between family life and film making, with an aim to develop further projects and encourage a critical dialogue on subjectivity and representation in film making practice. The audience was made up of the general public, academic peers, practitioners, colleagues, current students and alumni. The event was promoted and archived by a specifically commissioned website which encourages research around this theme beyond the event. Printed screening notes were circulated to promote the screening and detail the theme of film making and family, and direct viewers to the website...|$|R
2500|$|The broad {{study of}} African genetic {{diversity}} headed by Sarah Tishkoff found the San people {{to express the}} greatest genetic diversity among the 113 distinct populations <b>sampled,</b> <b>making</b> them one of 14 [...] "ancestral population clusters". The research also located the origin of modern human migration in south-western Africa, near the coastal border of Namibia and Angola.|$|R
30|$|These {{chemicals}} when {{injected into}} micromodels as in Fig.  1 {{to drive out}} oil, can help in understanding the interactions between crude oil and chemicals. Since cores are opaque, non-reusable, expensive and time consuming (Kenzhekhanov 2017), {{this has led to}} the development of transparent micromodels to imitate rock <b>samples</b> <b>making</b> them a set of standard tools for visualisation.|$|R

50|$|Berlin woolwork designs had naturalistic shading {{and more}} depth of {{perspective}} than the flat two-dimensional objects on traditional needlework. By mid-19th century adult needleworkers were devising long and narrow stitch samplers having geometric patterns done in woolwork. The Art Needlework movement and elimination of samplers from female education {{brought about the}} decline in traditional <b>sampler</b> <b>making</b> that continued into the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|The sampler, {{although}} powerful, has a {{very complex}} access-and-editing route and lacks the ability to set keyboard ranges for different <b>samples,</b> <b>making</b> it difficult to create realistic sounds from a set of multisamples. There is, however a work-around for this via an external editor on the PC & Mac called: MC-909 Editor Update v3.1, that is freely available for download at this site.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} dated surviving sampler, {{housed in}} the Victoria and Albert Museum, was made by Jane Bostocke who included her name and the date 1598 in the inscription, but the earliest documentary reference to <b>sampler</b> <b>making</b> goes back another hundred years, to the 1502 household expense accounts of Elizabeth of York, which record the purchase of an ell of linen to make a sampler for the queen.|$|R
5000|$|Research on PCCI is limited, {{and studies}} on the subject have often been {{conflicting}} in results, {{in part due to}} differing means of assessing and defining the phenomenon, which makes comparison and synthesis difficult. [...] Most studies have involved small <b>samples,</b> <b>making</b> generalization difficult. There has been a focus on PCCI in younger cancer patients. This makes it difficult to draw conclusions about PCCI in the elderly.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{forming the}} Steel <b>Making</b> <b>Department</b> of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, the Kawasaki Steel Corporation was {{incorporated}} in August 1950 following the post-World War II {{breakup of the}} Kawasaki Dockyard. It was headed by a Japanese engineer Nishiyama Yatarō, who had convinced Kawasaki Heavy Industries to perform the breakup. At {{this point in time}} the company was using open hearth furnaces, but during the 1950s it built an integrated steel mill located at Chiba Works on reclaimed land in Chiba City.|$|R
50|$|For {{this album}} the band decided to {{experiment}} with different instrument tones, vocal effects, <b>samples</b> (<b>making</b> segues between songs by cutting and pasting pieces from elsewhere in the album), and the like. They also tried {{a different approach to}} mixing that left the recording often sounding flat and tinny. The entire album was significantly remixed in 2013 to give a different perspective and rectify many of those complaints.|$|R
40|$|Total {{reflection}} X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) {{analysis is}} an excellent tool to determine major, minor and trace elements in minuscule amounts of <b>samples,</b> <b>making</b> this technique very suitable for pigment analysis. Collecting minuscule amounts of pigment material from precious works of art {{by means of a}} cotton swab is a well-accepted sampling method, but poses specific challenges when TXRF is to be used for the characterization of the unknown material...|$|R
50|$|The four ADCs can be {{simultaneously}} <b>sampled</b> <b>making</b> a {{wide range}} of precision analogue control equipment possible. It is also possible to use a hardware scheduler for the multiplexer array, allowing good timing accuracy when sampling more than 4 channels, independent of the main processor thread. The sampling and multiplexing trigger can be controlled {{from a variety of sources}} including timers and built-in comparators, allowing for irregular sampling intervals where needed.|$|R
25|$|The various {{separate}} newsrooms for television, {{radio and}} online operations were merged {{into a single}} multimedia newsroom. Programme making within the newsrooms was brought {{together to form a}} multimedia programme <b>making</b> <b>department.</b> BBC World Service director Peter Horrocks said that the changes would achieve efficiency at a time of cost-cutting at the BBC. In his blog, he wrote that by using the same resources across the various broadcast media meant fewer stories could be covered, or by following more stories, there would be fewer ways to broadcast them.|$|R
40|$|New {{developments}} in high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (HRXCT) are promising for the broader {{application of this}} non-destructive imaging method in plant sciences. Here, we demonstrate how detailed three-dimensional morphological traits can be extracted rapidly from in vivo Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings without sample manipulation. Furthermore, ex vivo scanning at sub-micron resolution allows the quantification and visualization of the cellular organization of plant tissue <b>samples,</b> <b>making</b> HRXCT a desired tool in developmental plant biology...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} zinc-finger sex chromosome-linked genes Zfx/Zfy and the sex-determining region Y (Sry) genes for gender {{determination}} of biopsy samples from marine and riverine tucuxi dolphins (Sotalia guianensis and S. fluviatilis). We also evaluated {{the performance of}} these genes with decomposed carcasses, for which sexing cannot rely on the direct examination of the reproductive tract. Both systems proved reliable for sexing 46 fresh and decomposed <b>samples,</b> <b>making</b> them especially useful when biopsy darting is coupled with photo-identification studies...|$|R
50|$|Band {{samplers}} {{were more}} decorative than the utilitarian random motif spot samplers, and stitchers finished them by adding their names, dates of completion, and sometimes teacher or school names. As {{the work of}} <b>sampler</b> <b>making</b> moved into schools in the late 17th and early 18th centuries design styles changed. Alphabets and verses were added along with pictorial elements such as architectural motifs, landscapes, and large potted plants. Educational themes included maps, multiplication tables, perpetual calendars, and acrostic puzzles.|$|R
50|$|The ISET {{technology}} {{is based on}} the observation that tumor cells of all types of solid cancers are larger than blood cells (leukocytes and erythrocytes). However, blood filtration to recover rare circulating tumor cells without loss and without cell damage is a challenge. The ISET test uses a specially designed device and specially designed filters to allow the elimination of all erythrocytes and most leukocytes from the <b>sample,</b> <b>making</b> the subsequent cytopathology process significantly easier and more accurate.|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of recursive least squares and weighted least squares is made which can adapt its structure such that a relation between in- and output can he approximated, {{even when the}} structure of this relation is unknown beforehand. This method can adapt its structure on-line while it preserves information offered by previous <b>samples,</b> <b>making</b> it applicable in a control setting. This method has been tested with compntergenerated data, and it b used in a simulation to learn the non-linear state-dependent effects, both with good success...|$|R
50|$|The {{antibody}} based methods use designed {{antibodies to}} bind to proteins of interest. These antibodies can be bound to fluorescent molecules such as quantum dots of different colors. Since different colored quantum dots {{are attached to}} different antibodies {{it is possible to}} identify multiple different proteins in a single cell. This method also allows the quantum dots to be washed off of the antibodies without damaging the <b>sample,</b> <b>making</b> it possible to do multiple rounds of protein quantification using this method on the same sample.|$|R
