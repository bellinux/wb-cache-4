25|$|When {{he came to}} a {{cave and}} lodged there, God asked him what he was doing there. Elijah said that he had been moved by zeal for God, as the Israelites had forsaken God's covenant, thrown down God's altars, and killed God's prophets, leaving only Elijah, and they sought to kill him, too. God told Elijah to stand on the mount, and God passed by. A great wind rent the mountains, and broke the rocks in pieces, but God was not in the wind. Then an {{earthquake}} came, but God was not in the earthquake. Then a fire came, but God was not in the fire. And then came a still <b>small</b> <b>voice,</b> which asked him what he was doing there. Elijah repeated that he had been moved by zeal for God, as the Israelites had forsaken God's covenant, thrown down God's altars, and killed God's prophets, leaving only Elijah, and they sought to kill him, too. God told him to go to Damascus and anoint Hazael to be king over Aram, to anoint Jehu to be king over Israel, and to anoint Elisha to succeed Elijah as prophet. God foretold that any who escaped the sword of Hazael would be killed by Jehu; any who escaped the sword of Jehu would be killed by Elisha; and God would leave alive in Israel only the 7 thousand who had not bowed to Baal. So Elijah found Elisha, who was plowing with one of his 12 yoke of oxen, and Elijah cast his mantle on Elisha. Elisha left the oxen, asked Elijah for permission to kiss his parents goodbye, killed the oxen and distributed their meat to the people, and went to follow Elijah.|$|E

500|$|For Susan Alexander Kane's operatic sequence, Welles {{suggested}} that Herrmann compose a witty parody of a Mary Garden vehicle, an aria from Salammbô. [...] "Our problem {{was to create}} something {{that would give the}} audience the feeling of the quicksand into which this simple little girl, having a charming but <b>small</b> <b>voice,</b> is suddenly thrown," [...] Herrmann said. Writing in the style of a 19th-century French Oriental opera, Herrmann put the aria in a key that would force the singer to strain to reach the high notes, culminating in a high D, well outside the range of Susan Alexander. Soprano Jean Forward dubbed the vocal part for Comingore. Houseman claimed to have written the libretto, based on Jean Racine's Athalie and Phedre, although some confusion remains since Lucille Fletcher remembered preparing the lyrics. Fletcher, then Herrmann's wife, wrote the libretto for his opera Wuthering Heights.|$|E

Billboard magazine called [...] "Together Again" [...] "a gorgeous disco ode to loved ones lost to AIDS-related illnesses". Jackson [...] "has clearly been studying Donna Summer records, delivering a wonderfully nuanced performance that takes firm command of the track's vibrant house beat without sacrificing an ounce of emotion". Danyel Smith, while interviewing Jackson for Vibe in November 1997, elaborated that the song was a big, perfect ode to Donna Summer, and likened it to her songs [...] "MacArthur Park" [...] and [...] "Last Dance". In 1999, 'Together Again" [...] won the award for [...] "Most Played Song" [...] at the BMI Pop Awards.|$|E

500|$|Jackson has a soprano vocal range. Over {{the course}} of her career, she has {{received}} frequent criticism for the limits of her vocal capabilities, especially in comparison to contemporary artists such as Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. In comparing her vocal technique to Houston and Aretha Franklin, vocal coach Roger Love states that [...] "hen Janet sings, she allows a tremendous amount of air to come through. She's obviously aiming for a sexy, sultry effect, and on one level that works nicely. But actually, it's fairly limited." [...] He adds that while her voice is suitable for studio recording, it doesn't translate well to stage because despite having [...] "great songs, incredible dancing, and her star like presence, the live show is still magnificent. But the voice is not the star." [...] Biographer David Ritz commented, [...] "on Janet's albums—and in her videos and live performances, which revealed a crisp, athletic dance technique [...] singing wasn't the point," [...] saying emphasis was placed on [...] "her slamming beats, infectious hooks, and impeccable production values." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant magazine claimed critics opposing her <b>small</b> <b>voice</b> [...] "somehow missed the explosive 'gimme a beat' vocal pyrotechnics she unleashes all over 'Nasty'... Or that they completely dismissed how perfect her tremulous hesitance fits into the abstinence anthem 'Let's Wait Awhile'." [...] Classical composer Louis Andriessen has praised Jackson for her [...] "rubato, sense of rhythm, sensitivity, and the childlike quality of her strangely erotic voice." [...] Several critics also consider her voice to often be enveloped within her music's production. Music critic J. D. Considine noted [...] "on albums, Jackson's sound isn't defined by her voice so much as by the way her voice is framed by the lush, propulsive production of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis." [...] Wendy Robinson of PopMatters said [...] "the power of Janet Jackson's voice does not lie in her pipes. She doesn't blow, she whispers... Jackson's confectionary vocals are masterfully complemented by gentle harmonies and balanced out by pulsing rhythms, so she's never unpleasant to listen to." [...] Matthew Perpetus of Fluxblog suggested Jackson's vocal techniques as a study for indie rock music, considering it to possess [...] "a somewhat subliminal effect on the listener, guiding and emphasizing dynamic shifts without distracting attention from its primal hooks." [...] Perpetus added: [...] "Her voice effortlessly transitions from a rhythmic toughness to soulful emoting to a flirty softness without overselling any aspect of her performance... a continuum of emotions and attitudes that add up to the impression that we're listening to the expression of a formed human being with contradictions and complexities." ...|$|E

2500|$|Electrostatic {{loudspeakers}} use a {{high voltage}} electric field (rather than a magnetic field) {{to drive a}} thin statically charged membrane. Because they are driven over the entire membrane surface rather than from a <b>small</b> <b>voice</b> coil, they ordinarily provide a more linear and lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers. They also have a relatively narrow dispersion pattern that can make for precise sound-field positioning. [...] However, their optimum listening area is small {{and they are not}} very efficient speakers. [...] They have the disadvantage that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited because of practical construction limitations—the further apart the stators are positioned, the higher the voltage must be to achieve acceptable efficiency. [...] This increases the tendency for electrical arcs as well as increasing the speaker's attraction of dust particles. Arcing remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when the panels are allowed to collect dust or dirt and are driven with high signal levels.|$|E

2500|$|Unprogrammed worship (also {{known as}} waiting worship, [...] "silent worship", or holy communion {{in the manner}} of Friends) is based on the {{practices}} of George Fox and the Early Friends, who based their religious beliefs and practices on their interpretation of how the early Christians worshipped God their Heavenly Father. Friends gather together in [...] "expectant waiting upon God" [...] to experience his still <b>small</b> <b>voice</b> leading them from within. There is no plan on how the meeting will proceed, and actual practice varies widely between Meetings and individual worship services. Friends believe that God plans what will happen, with his spirit leading people to speak. When a participant feels led to speak, he or she will stand and share a spoken message of ("vocal ministry") in front of others. When this happens, Quakers believe that the spirit of God is speaking through the speaker. After someone has spoken, it is customary to allow a few minutes pass in silence for reflection on what has been said, before further vocal ministry is given. Sometimes a meeting is entirely silent, sometimes many speak. These meetings lasted for several hours in George Fox's day. Modern meetings are often limited to an hour, ending when two people (usually the elders) exchange the sign of peace by handshake. This handshake is often shared by the others. This style of worship is the norm in Great Britain, Ireland, the continent of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Southern Africa, Canada, and parts of the United States (particularly yearly meetings associated with Friends General Conference and Beanite Quakerism)—constituting about 11% of Quakers. Those who worship in this style hold each person to be equal before God and capable of knowing the light of God directly. Anyone present may speak if they feel led to do so. Traditionally, Recorded Ministers were recognised for their particular gift in vocal ministry. This religious practice continues among Conservative Friends and Liberal Friends (e.g. New York Yearly Meeting). Many meetings where Liberal Friends predominate abolished this religious practice. London Yearly Meeting of Friends abolished the acknowledging and recording of Recorded Ministers in 1924.|$|E

[...] The Times (not connected to The Sunday Times) wrote: [...] "In an extraordinary inversion of its traditional role, Amnesty has stifled its own still <b>small</b> <b>voice</b> of conscience," [...] and journalist Nick Cohen wrote in The Observer [...] "Amnesty is living in the make-believe world ... where it thinks that liberals are free to form alliances with defenders of clerical fascists who want to do everything in their power to suppress liberals, most notably liberal-minded Muslims." [...] Antara Dev Sen wrote in Daily News and Analysis: [...] "It was a gutsy stand, given the dread of political correctness that cripples our thought and makes us bend over backwards till we almost topple over.... Suspending Sahgal was an illiberal knee-jerk response unbecoming of this cherished human rights organisation."

[...] Feminist historian Urvashi Butalia also spoke up in her support. [...] Douglas Murray wrote in The Telegraph that [...] "Amnesty is longer an organisation worth listening to, let alone supporting", and The Wall Street Journal wrote: [...] "it's a pity that a group that was born to give voice to the victims of oppression should now devote itself to sanitizing the oppressors".|$|E
