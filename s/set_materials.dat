5000|$|As {{the need}} to collect these vestiges of rural traditions became more compelling, {{the need to}} formalize this new field of {{cultural}} studies became apparent. The British Folklore Society was established in 1878 and the American Folklore Society was established a decade later. These were just two of a plethora of academic societies founded {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century by educated members of the emerging middle class. For literate, urban intellectuals and students of folklore the folk was someone else and the past was recognized as being something truly different. Folklore became a measure of the progress of society, how far we had moved forward into the industrial present and indeed removed ourselves from a past marked by poverty, illiteracy and superstition. The task of both the professional folklorist and the amateur at the turn of the 20th century was to collect and classify cultural artifacts from the pre-industrial rural areas, parallel to the drive in the life sciences to do the same for the natural world. [...] "Folk was a clear label to <b>set</b> <b>materials</b> apart from modern life…material specimens, which were meant to be classified in the natural history of civilization. Tales, originally dynamic and fluid, were given stability and concreteness by means of the printed page." ...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} thermocycling (500 cycles, 5 °C/ 55 °C) on the push-out bond strength of calcium silicate based cements including WMTA, Nano-WMTA, and Bioaggregate to root dentin. Forty-eight dentin slices were prepared and divided into 3 groups (n= 16) and filled with Angelus WMTA, Nano-WMTA, or Bioaggregate. After incubation, half of the samples were thermocycled while the other half remained untreated. Push-out bond strength was calculated, and the modes of the bond failures were determined by SEM. The highest bond strength was seen in nonthermocycled Nano-WMTA samples and the lowest in thermocycled Bioaggregate samples. The significant differences between nonthermocycled and thermocycled samples were only noticed in WMTA and Nano-WMTA groups (P< 0. 001). The mode of failure for thermocycled samples of all three cements was mostly cohesive. Thermocycling process can drastically affect the push-out bond strength of calcium silicate based cements. The intrastructural damages occurred due to the thermal stresses, causing cohesive failures in <b>set</b> <b>materials.</b> Sealing property of endodontic cements which have experienced the thermal stresses can be jeopardized due to occlusal forces happening in furcation cites...|$|E
40|$|The {{color of}} 7 {{composite}} resins, an unfilled re-storative resin, and 3 glaze coatings was deter-mined by reflection spectrophotometry and visually with Munsell color tabs. Statistically significant correlations existed between com-parable {{parameters of the}} spectrophotometric and Munsell data. There were observable coloi variations among the 11 resins studied, but only 3 materials were within the range fol natural tooth color. J Dent Res 57 (4) 557 - 562, April 1978. As {{a result of the}} color variation found in natu-ral teeth", 2 and the translucency of enamel and dentin, it has been characteristically difficult to obtain an exact shade match between direct restorative materials and tooth structure. 3 The Bis-GMA resin matrix in composite restorative materials has been combined with an optically matched dispersion of ceramic particles to ap-proximate more closely the various clinical shades of natural teeth. The majority of com-mercial products are marketed in a "universal" shade which is sufficiently translucent to re, flect the internal shades of underlying tooth structure. When underlying dentin is either thin or nonexistent, the restorative material must provide total color for the restoration.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} potential imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s {{disease by}} combining brain cortical thickness (CThk) and functional connectivity and to validate this model’s diagnostic accuracy in a validation <b>set.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: Data from 98 subjects was retrospectively reviewed, including a study set (n = 63) and a validation set from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 35). From each subject, data for CThk and functional connectivity of the default mode network was extracted from structural T 1 -weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Cortical regions with {{significant differences between}} patients and healthy controls in the correlation of CThk and functional connectivity were identified in the study set. The diagnostic accuracy of functional connectivity measures combined with CThk in the identified regions was evaluated against that in the medial temporal lobes using the validation set and application of a support vector machine. Results: Group-wise differences in the correlation of CThk and default mode network functional connectivity were identified in the superior temporal (p < 0. 001) and supramarginal gyrus (p = 0. 007) of the left cerebral hemisphere. Default mode network functional connectivity combined with the CThk of those two regions were more accurate than that combined with the CThk of both medial temporal lobes (91. 7 % vs. 75 %). Conclusion: Combining functional information with CThk of the superior temporal and supramarginal gyri in the left cerebral hemisphere improves diagnostic accuracy, making it a potential imaging biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of mixtures mainly composed of cement, gravel, water and, sometimes, specific additives represent {{a common practice}} in the civil construction sector. Such mixtures originate what is usually and simply called “concrete”. Different concrete types can be realised according to a different utilisation of the different constituting materials, {{both in terms of}} single component characteristics and their relative amount. As a consequence the quality control process of the different phases, allowing to realise a concrete of the desired quality, represents one of the fundamental steps in the production process. To control concrete quality a lot of well established and reliable measuring control methods exist. They are finalised to physically, or chemically, evaluate specific attributes of the constituting and/or the final <b>set</b> <b>materials.</b> The adopted approaches do not allow to correctly identify and quantify an important phenomena whose entity can prejudiced the final quality of concrete, in terms of mechanical strength, insulating property, aesthetic attributes, etc., that is “segregation”. Such a term is referred to the possibility that during setting, specific phenomena, related to particulate solids fractions characteristics, occur, causing the production of a concrete of not homogeneous mass characteristics. In this paper an attempt to define a set of procedures to fully characterise and quantify segregation adopting an imaging based logic is presented, analysed and discussed with reference to industrial pre-mixed and ready to use concrete. A comparison is also made between the proposed imaging based techniques and the analyses usually carried out, at industrial laboratory scale, for standard quality control...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} a Master´s thesis in Industrial Design Engineering at Luleå University of Technology, based on IDEO´s user-centered design process, which {{contains}} the three phases; Inspiration, Ideation and Implementation. The product development started with an extensive user research, which based on 512 respondents showed an experienced problem with keeping order in narrow hallways. Many respondents experienced stress, when leaving {{their home and}} sometimes difficulties with finding their belongings. Further researches were made in cooperation with a focus group containing seven participants. In {{this phase of the}} project, they collected valuable data in terms of design probes, and were further involved during the entire design process. The inspiration phase ended up with six discovered needs, which were summarized in a need specification, which in turn was the basis of further development. The Ideation phase included scientific methods for coming up with solutions based on the users´ needs and their discovered problems. Three concepts were chosen and developed, among others by building three full-scale mock-ups in cardboard, to visualize their size and expression. The final concept was chosen, based on the user group as well as a concept selection matrix. It was furthermore developed in the Implementation phase; among others by building a full-scale prototype, to evaluate its functions. Further all dimensions were <b>set,</b> <b>materials</b> were chosen and proposals of manufacturing methods were established. This work resulted in the stylistically pure modular based hallway furniture, FJÄLL, an environmentally friendly product, focusing on smart storage for narrow hallways. It is an adaptable solution available in five different versions, which suits one person as well as a whole family by satisfying their specific needs.

40|$|Introduction EndoSequence BC Sealer (Brasseler, Savannah, GA) is a {{premixed}} tricalcium silicate–based {{root canal}} sealer that requires {{moisture from the}} root dentin to hydrate. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the setting of EndoSequence BC Sealer and other sealers in contact with human dentin in a simulated clinical environment. Methods EndoSequence BC Sealer, MTA Fillapex (Angelus, Londrina, Brazil), Septodont Sealer (Septodont, Saint Maur-des-Fosses, France), and Apexit Plus (Ivoclar, Schaan, Lichtenstein) were assessed. Caries-free lower premolars extracted for orthodontic purposes in patients aged 13 – 16 years were standardized to a 10 -mm root length and were filled with test sealers and set up in a dentin pressure model for 14 days. In addition, set sealers immersed in physiologic solution for 14 days were also assessed. The <b>set</b> <b>materials</b> in solution and materials retrieved from the dentin pressure setup were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. The setting time and radiopacity were assessed using ISO 6876 : 2002 specifications. Furthermore, mineral ion leaching was evaluated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results All the sealers tested exhibited formation of a calcium phosphate phase when in contact with physiologic solution. Septodont Sealer and Apexit Plus did not exhibit the formation of a calcium phosphate phase in the dentin pressure setup. The fluid in the system was enough to allow the setting of EndoSequence BC Sealer, which did not set in a dry environment. All materials leached calcium with the Septodont Sealer, exhibiting double the calcium ion leaching compared with EndoSequence BC Sealer. Conclusions Using the dentinal fluid pressure system resulted in an adequate flow of dentinal fluid that allowed EndoSequence BC Sealer to set inside the root canal. Although the sealers tested were tricalcium silicate based, the hydration reaction and bioactivity in the presence of dentinal fluid were different to hydration in vitro. Thus, clinically, material bioactivity cannot be assumed. peer-reviewe...|$|E
