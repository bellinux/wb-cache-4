These paintings were shown in ‘A Duck for Mr. Darwin: Evolutionary Thinking & the Struggle to Exist’, a group exhibition at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, curated by Alessandro Vincentell. Other artists in the exhibition included Christine Borland, Mark Dion, Dorothy Cross, Tania Kovats, Mark Wallinger, Richard Wentworth and Rachel Whiteread. All the artists in this exhibition had also been selected for the ‘Darwin’s Canopy’ project launched by the Natural History Museum, London to celebrate the 200 th Anniversary of the life and work of Charles Darwin. ‘Darwin's Canopy’ was curated by Bob Bloomfield and Bergit Arends. Fairnington’s paintings were derived from multiple photographs of eyes displayed as specimens in the Natural History Museum collections. One other painting by Fairnington, ‘Meardy Tally’, a depiction of a life-sized Charolais <b>stock</b> <b>bull,</b> was shown alongside the paintings of eyes in ‘A Duck for Mr Darwin: Evolutionary Thinking & the Struggle to Exist’.

The painting of Tally, a prize winning <b>stock</b> <b>bull,</b> emerged from research into the lineage of painting animals, looking at the connections between 18 th and 19 th century English naive paintings of livestock, George Stubbs famous painting Whistlejacket (1762) up to Mark Wallinger's paintings of horses, Race, Class and Sex (1992) and Ghost (2001). The title “A Duck for Mr. Darwin” was taken from a chapter in David Quamen’s book ‘The Kiwi’s Egg’. In it he describes the incident of the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace sending his senior, Charles Darwin a rare species of Duck from the island of Lombok, Indonesia. It was 1857, {{two years before the}} publication of The Origin of Species. Darwin never received the gift, he did however receiver Wallace’s paper (on the transmutation of species) which triggered an intellectual tussle and a race to publish The Origin of Species. To coincide with Darwin 200, The Struggle to Exist was a group exhibition of contemporary artists exploring the scientific discourse surrounding evolutionary thinking & the theory of natural selection. Professor Richard Dawkins has written of the development of the theory of natural selection “the most important idea ever to occur to a human mind”. 150 years after the publication of Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species there are profound and radical implications to the ideas generated by Darwin and his contemporaries that have been a rich source of inspiration to contemporary visual artists. Using both the gallery and a wider BALTIC context (library/archive and QUAY) this initiative was a project involving commissioned work, exhibition and public events & talks exploring the power of specific ideas to change the world. Darwin 200 was a national programme of events celebrating Charles Darwin’s scientific ideas and their impact around his two hundredth birthday on 12 February 2009. As well as celebrating the impact of Darwin’s ideas about evolution, Darwin 200 focussed on his approach {{to the understanding of the}} natural world, and his outstanding example as a scientist, continues to have on our lives. The artists included were Tania Kovats, Dorothy Cross, Mark Dion, Andrew Dodds, Mark Fairnington, Ben Jeans Houghton, Charles Avery, Marcus Coates and Conrad Shawcross.

40|$|Background BVD and IBR are {{contagious}} viral diseases highly {{prevalent in}} Irish cattle. Despite their significant reproductive and economic impact {{very little is}} known about the BVD and IBR status of stock bulls (a bull used for breeding purposes). There are still a high proportion of dairy farms in Ireland that rely on the use of a bull for breeding cattle and ensuring the fertility of the bulls is of paramount importance for the efficiency of the farms. The prevalence of BoHV- 1 and BVD in stock bulls in Irish dairy herds has never been investigated. The objectives of this study therefore were: (i) to provide descriptive, observational data on the use of stock bulls on Irish dairy farms; (ii) to investigate the BVD and BoHV 1 status of a sub-set of stock bulls; (iii) to investigate factors associated with BVD and BoHV 1 status of stock bulls and (iv) to investigate factors associated with dairy herd status for BVD and BoHV 1, including any associations with the use of <b>stock</b> <b>bull.</b> A total of 529 blood samples from bulls involved in the dairy breeding process were analysed for BVD virus using RT-PCR, and BoHV- 1 antibodies by ELISA test. A total of 305 different dairy herds took part in the study and the overall BVD and BoHV- 1 herd status was determined by ELISA using four bulk tank milk samples over the 2009 lactation. Logistic regression was used to investigate the associations between the stock bulls and BVD and BoHV- 1 herd and individual status. Results Of the 305 total participating farms, 235 farms (77  %) had at least one bull and 167 farms had purchased bulls. Two bulls (0. 4  %) out of 529 tested were found positive for BVD virus and 87 (16. 7  %) tested seropositive for BoHV- 1. Some significant associations were identified between the purchase of bulls and both viral diseases. Purchased bulls were three times more likely to be seropositive for BoHV- 1 than homebred bulls. In the same way, herds with purchased bulls were three times more likely to be classified as seropositive for BVD and four times more likely to have evidence of recent BoHV- 1 circulation than farms where all the bulls were homebred. Conclusions The prevalence of BoHV- 1 and BVD in stock bulls in Irish dairy herds has never been investigated. This study highlights the widespread use of stock bulls in Irish dairy herds, as well as the high rate of exchange of bulls between farms. Significant associations were found between the origin of the bull and their serological BoHV- 1 status. In keeping with these results, bulls with higher number movements between farms were more likely to be seropositive for BoHV- 1. peer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} and evaluate how biosecurity measures are implemented on Swedish farms with specialized beef production. In Swedish specialized beef production young calves are purchased for intensive rearing, mainly from dairy farms. The calves can be as young as two weeks old. They are reared and later sent to slaughter, and will be classified either as calves (about 8 - 11 months of age) or as young <b>stock</b> (<b>bulls,</b> heifers and steers older than 11 months). A large part of these beef producing herds purchase calves from many different farms, often through farm-to-farm agreements or through slaughterhouse agents. The agents collect young calves from different farms and thereafter sell and deliver them to specialized beef producers. Since the calves are very young and are mixed with calves from different farms there is a high risk of disease outbreaks. As in many parts of the world the two biggest health issues for calves are enteric and respiratory diseases, common disease pathogens are bovine Corona Virus (BCV), Cryptosporidium parvum (C. Parvum) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV). Disease introduction and outbreaks can be prevented through different preventive measures, i. e. biosecurity. The implementation of biosecurity is a common practice in the pig and poultry industry, but not as widespread in the cattle production. The actual extent in Sweden is not known and this study was therefore undertaken. A questionnaire on biosecurity measures was sent to a random sample of 200 farms with specialized beef production, and 100 replied. In addition, face-to-face interviews were made with two slaughterhouse agents and one person responsible for courses needed for authorization of animal transports. The results showed that farmers at specialized beef rearing units perform few biosecurity measures; the majority performed rodent and bird control, participated in the voluntary salmonella program and swept the feed area. Larger herds performed more biosecurity measures compared to smaller farms. According to the participating farms not a large proportion of the calves expressed signs of diarrhea and pneumonia, but diarrhea is usually more common among younger calves than older ones and the age of the purchased calves varies between these herds. There was also a significant association between performing biosecurity measures and cases of diarrhea in the quarantine barn, less cases of diarrhea when implementing biosecurity but not a significant association between pneumonia and biosecurity. When interviewing slaughterhouse agents it seemed possible to implement a “health declaration” program for BRSV-calves in Sweden, similar to the previous BVDV-program. This might motivate specialized beef producers (and dairy herds) to improve their biosecurity. Nonetheless, there is room for an improvement of biosecurity in the Swedish specialized beef industry...|$|R
