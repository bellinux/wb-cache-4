5|$|The Seri Rambai is a 28-pounder, 127.5 inches (3.25m) {{long with}} a calibre of 6.1 inches; (15cm); the barrel {{measures}} 118.75 inches; (3.02 m). It {{was cast in}} 1603 and is the largest bronze gun in Malaysia. In front of the dolphin handles is a decorative band featuring three pairs of heraldic lions with long, spiralling tails. Each pair faces a vase containing flowers. Between the handles and the Dutch East India Company's seal is a Javi inscription, inlaid with silver, celebrating the gun's capture in 1613. The base ring is incised with the gunsmith's <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> <b>date</b> of manufacture.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in many of}} the artist's late works, the {{painting}} is characterized by an improvisational handling, with details that read as unfinished. There are areas, such as the face and {{the right side of the}} hat, where a gray layer of paint has been used as a tonal middle ground, upon which bold lights and rich dark accents have been added, sometimes with rapid strokes of paint applied wet-into-wet. In several places, Rembrandt [...] "drew" [...] into the paint while it was still wet, incising lines in the mustache, left eyebrow, and shirt collar. The hands, palette, brushes, and fur lining of the artist's gown, or [...] "tabbaard", were painted with great rapidity. Whether Rembrandt intended to more fully finish these areas is not known, but {{the painting}}'s overall forcefulness renders concern for its completion superfluous. Subsequent generations of artists appreciated the unfinished passages: Joshua Reynolds commented on its [...] "very unfinished manner", but found it [...] "admirable for its colour and effect," [...] and Jean-Honoré Fragonard made a painted copy of it. That Rembrandt may not have considered the work complete is suggested by the omission of his <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> <b>date,</b> unusual for a self-portrait by the artist. Alternatively, it is possible that Rembrandt's intent was to leave an iconic biographical image for posterity, more profound than a traditional self-portrait. In this vein, a comparison to Titian's late [...] "unfinished" [...] self-portrait in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, which Self Portrait with Two Circles resembles, is appropriate.|$|E
6000|$|Ten {{days after}} his visit she {{received}} a communication from Mrs. Gereth--a telegram of eight words, exclusive of <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> <b>date.</b> [...] "Come up immediately and stay with me here"--it was characteristically sharp, as Maggie said; but, as Maggie added, it was also characteristically kind. [...] "Here" [...] was an hotel in London, and Maggie had embraced a condition of life which already began to produce in her some yearning for hotels in London. She would have responded in an instant, and she was surprised that her sister seemed to hesitate. Fleda's hesitation, which lasted but an hour, was expressed in that young lady's own mind by the reflection that in obeying her friend's summons she shouldn't know what she should be [...] "in for." [...] Her friend's summons, however, was but another name for her friend's appeal; and Mrs. Gereth's bounty had laid her under obligations more sensible than any reluctance. In the event--that {{is at the end}} of her hour--she testified to her gratitude by taking the train and to her mistrust by leaving her luggage. She went as if she had gone up for the day. In the train, however, she had another thoughtful hour, during which it was her mistrust that mainly deepened. She felt as if for ten days she had sat in darkness, looking to the east for a dawn that had not yet glimmered. Her mind had lately been less occupied with Mrs. Gereth; it had been so exceptionally occupied with Mona. If the sequel was to justify Owen's prevision of Mrs. Brigstock's action upon her daughter, this action was at the end of a week as much a mystery as ever. The stillness, all round, had been exactly what Fleda desired, but it gave her for the time a deep sense of failure, the sense of a sudden drop from a height at which she had all things beneath her. She had nothing beneath her now; she herself was at the bottom of the heap. No sign had reached her from Owen--poor Owen, who had clearly no news to give about his precious letter from Waterbath. If Mrs. Brigstock had hurried back to obtain that this letter should be written, Mrs. Brigstock might then have spared herself so great an inconvenience. Owen had been silent for the best of all reasons--the reason that he had had nothing in life to say. If the letter had not been written he would simply have had to introduce some large qualification into his account of his freedom. He had left his young friend under her refusal to listen to him until he should be able, on the contrary, to extend that picture; and his present submission was all in keeping with the rigid honesty that his young friend had prescribed.|$|E

50|$|Approximately 30 {{paintings}} are currently attributed to Philips Angel I, some with <b>dates</b> between 1642 <b>and</b> 1664 or 1668. He was mainly {{a still life}} painter.

50|$|Notarization and {{witnessing}} {{requirements on}} voter registration applications, ballot requests, and voted ballots present a real barrier to voting for many UOCAVA citizens. Citizens living {{in remote areas}} overseas are hindered because notary services may not exist or may be prohibitively expensive and difficult to access. Similarly, witnessing requirements, especially those that specify the age or citizenship of the witness, may disenfranchise voters who cannot satisfy this requirement due to their location or circumstances. Notarization or witnessing requirements for all absentee balloting materials should be removed, and the voter’s <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> <b>date,</b> under the self-administered oath on these voting materials, should verify {{the legitimacy of the}} voter and the application or ballot.|$|E
50|$|The museum Pinacoteca Nazionale (Siena) has his {{painting}} Madonna and Child with Four Saints, {{and has the}} <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> <b>date</b> (circa 1500). His brush has also been attributed to a few typical Sienese Madonna with Saints, preserved in private collections. One of his most famous works is in the parish church of Santa Maria Assunta (Assumption of Mary) in the small village of Casole d'Elsa near Siena. This altarpiece with arc-shaped pinnacles and predella, was painted by the artist in 1498. On it is a signature of Andrea. In the upper part, he portrayed Massacre of the Innocents, clearly inspired {{by the work of}} Matteo di Giovanni, {{and in the middle of}} the Madonna with Child and Saints.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the age of}} 40, Weber {{began working}} with the Fraktur motifs she became known for. One of her {{earliest}} documented art is illustrations she added to her songbook in 1866. Most of her work through the 1870s and 1880s were gifts for birthdays and special occasions. While traditional Fraktur focuses on text with some decorative embellishment, Weber's work is characterized by [...] "imaginitive visual expression". [...] She filled the page with depictions of birds, animals and flowers with only a dedication, <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> <b>date</b> inscribed below. Her artwork was heavily influenced by Mennonite themes such as the Tree of Life. According to the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Weber was [...] "the most original and prolific of Ontario's fraktur artists", which was particularly notable given the paucity of female fraktur artists.|$|E

The only proven his picture of that time was [...] "Portrait of a man" [...] ("Self-Portrait"). His work focuses mainly on painting portraits.

50|$|Raymond Martini, or Ramon Martí was a 13th-century Catalan Dominican friar and theologian. He {{is remembered}} for his polemic work Pugio Fidei (c. 1270).

From the proper front and proper {{back of the}} sculpture, the viewer sees a predominantly black and white structure. However, from the proper left and proper right of the sculpture, the viewer sees {{a wide variety of}} vivid colors. The sculpture is painted in a geometric pattern on all sides. There is a stylized <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> <b>date</b> near the base of the structure on the proper left side. The square-shaped foot of the sculpture sits on a 5 ft concrete base, and features a black and white geometric pattern which matches the overall aesthetic of the artwork. A large flood light is mounted flush with the concrete base on all four sides of the sculpture.

50|$|Another icon lacks <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> <b>date</b> but was {{probably}} painted {{at the beginning}} of the nineteenth century. An inscription records that it was donated in waqf by a certain Farah for the repose of his father’s soul. The icon displays an original composition with four different scenes from the life of the prophet Elias. The river Jordan is shown in the center with brown hills to either side. To the left, St Elias kneels, his hands uplifted to heaven; before him, a calf is consumed as a burnt-offering to God. Below right, he is seated under a tree as an angel brings him food. Above right, the kneeling Elie sees Christ appearing in a blue sphere borne by two angels amid rosy clouds. In his right hand, Christ holds a phylactery inscribed: ‘The people of Israel have renounced God and demolished his temples.’ Above the hill, St Elias is borne upwards in a chariot of fire drawn by four horses. He hands his folded cloak to his disciple Elisha, who stands on the summit. Elisha is about to strike the waters of the Jordan with his master’s cloak so that he can walk across it dry-shod. The ascent of Elias into heaven on a chariot of fire has usually inspired very decorative compositions. Here, in contrast, the composition is simple yet powerful, tending almost to abstraction. The colors are green, red, black, and brown, with a golden background.|$|E
