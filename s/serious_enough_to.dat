In a 2005 survey of 10,503 persons {{over the age}} of 16 in England, complications were reported in 31% of piercings, with professional help being necessary in 15.2%. 0.9% had complications <b>serious</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> require hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|In 1068, {{there was}} a revolt {{in the north of}} England against the rule of King William, few details of which are recorded. It was <b>serious</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> worry King William, who marched north and began the {{construction}} of castles at Warwick, Nottingham, York, Lincoln, Huntingdon and Cambridge.|$|E

5|$|Berryman {{was later}} {{nominated}} for a bar to his Distinguished Service Order for the September 1918 fighting, but this was subsequently downgraded to a second Mention in Despatches. He {{was wounded in the}} right eye in September 1918 while he was commanding the 14th Field Artillery Battery. Although his wound was <b>serious</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> warrant hospitalisation, there was no permanent damage to his vision. However, {{it was the end of}} his career as a battery commander, as the Army took the opportunity to transfer him to a staff post. From 28 October 1918 to 1 July 1919, he was Brigade Major of the 7th Infantry Brigade. With the war over, he returned to Australia in October 1919.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Jane Addams and Smith had a {{disagreement}} over Hull House's Sunday concerts. Smith, a classically trained musician, {{felt that the}} purpose of the events should be to present educationally challenging programs. Addams, felt that the programs should feature more popular music to promote Hull House and recruit broad audiences to experience the environment which the settlement house offered. A compromise was finally reached at the turn of the decade, with Sunday concerts featuring music which had a more popular appeal, and weekday evening programs focusing on more challenging material. The disagreement over content was <b>serious</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> lead to Smith's resignation in 1901. Though Addams did not relent on the Sunday content, she was able to persuade Smith to remain.|$|E
5|$|Nonfatal {{health effects}} were {{difficult}} to measure in the smog's immediate aftermath. Some of the health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything <b>serious</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|E
50|$|Many weapons, {{including}} aerial {{bombs in}} particular, are discovered during construction work, after lying undetected for decades.

5|$|On 18 October, Kronprinz was {{slightly}} grounded, though {{the damage was}} not <b>serious</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> necessitate withdrawal for repairs. By 20 October, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, Ösel, and Dagö were in German possession. The previous day, the Admiralstab had ordered the cessation of naval actions {{and the return of}} the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible. On the 26th, Kronprinz was more seriously grounded on the return trip to Kiel. She managed to reach Kiel on 2 November, and subsequently Wilhelmshaven. Repairs were effected from 24 November to 8 January.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Pi Vell, Pi Jove {{had escaped}} the attentions of vandals until more recently, {{due to its}} lower {{political}} profile and greater distance (200 m) from the road. In 2010, it was discovered with a circumferential cut through the bark, in addition to apparent shotgun damage. Vandals attacked it in June 2015, attempting to saw through one of its trunks, {{though it was not}} thought that the damage was <b>serious</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> kill the affected trunk. As a precaution, in December 2015 arborists installed a frame to hold the three trunks together and ensure their stability. In January 2016, deeper chainsaw cuts were discovered on the already-damaged trunk which are believed harsh enough to kill the trunk altogether; these vandals also attacked Pi Vell.|$|E
5|$|The only damage {{she took}} that year {{occurred}} 30 April 1943, {{while she was}} changing stations on formation, Milwaukee struck Omahas starboard bow. The collision destroyed one of her paravanes and rupturing some plating, which caused some flooding. Omahas damage control party shored up one hole with two mattresses {{and were able to}} stop the leak. One compartment was completely flooded with another compartment requiring pumping out every two hours. On Milwaukee, the 6-inch guns and torpedo tubes on her port side were unserviceable. Several holes had opened up along her port side that were above the main deck, along with some leaks under the waterline from damage to plates and rivets. Milwaukee also lost her No.3 main circulation pump. The damage was determined not to be <b>serious</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> halt their mission and the two cruisers, after completing their patrol, put into Rio de Janeiro for the needed repairs at the Brazilian Navy Yard.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedures}} {{used in the}} previous tests were repeated, {{but this time the}} winch cable snagged, and the test samples had to be retrieved by a jeep, exposing its crew to more radiation. The Los Alamos personnel assigned to remove the filters from the B-17 drones had apparently carried out the procedure on X-Ray and Yoke without problems, but this time three of them suffered radiation burns on their hands <b>serious</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be hospitalized and need skin grafting. One of the men who had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then also found to have burns on his hands and was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May. Once again the drone tank gave trouble, and bogged in the crater, but the soil samples were retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|There {{does not}} appear to be a {{difference}} in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still <b>serious</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> require hospitalisation.|$|E
5|$|With {{his three}} {{divisions}} reunited on 7 September 1812, Nansouty's Ist Cavalry Corps saw {{action at the}} Battle of Borodino. He {{was placed on the}} French right, in second line, behind the Corps of Marshal Davout and, after Murat managed to take two of the redoubts on the Russian left, Nansouty placed his men on the right of this position and then supported the advance of {{the right wing of the}} army. With the Russians making an offensive comeback, Nansouty placed himself at the head of the heavy divisions of Saint-Germain and Valence and charged and while doing so a bullet pierced one of his knees. This was Nansouty's first battle wound and it was <b>serious</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> end his active role during this campaign. He was transported to Moscow following the battle and although still wounded, on 10 October, he was entrusted with the mission of commanding the convoy that was to take the wounded generals and colonels, as well as the main trophies captured, behind the lines. During this mission, he was exposed to great danger, to famine and extreme cold, which impacted his already frail health. He was then allowed to return to France and recover from his injury.|$|E
