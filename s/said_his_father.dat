Melvinia's first son, Dolphus T. Shields, was biracial and {{born into}} slavery about 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of her master.

Dolphus Shields moved to Birmingham, Alabama after the Civil War, {{and some of his}} children migrated to Cleveland, Ohio and Chicago.|$|E

Overcoming Bell's skepticism, Powell made {{his way up the}} stairs to Seward's third-floor bedroom. At the top of the staircase he was stopped by Seward's son, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward, to whom he repeated the medicine story; Frederick, suspicious, <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> was asleep.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E

25|$|In 1982 Morshead's son Ian {{published}} {{a biography of}} his father. Regarding his father's death he was suspicious because, although the first newspaper reports <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> had been murdered, later reports spoke of his being killed by a tiger, or by rebels. In 1980 Ian Morshead visited Burma and spoke {{to some of the}} people involved at the time. When his father's family were back in England, Henry's sister Ruth had been living with him in Burma. Henry disapproved of a local leader of the community, Syed Ali, who had been seen out horse riding with Ruth. Morshead had possibly had an argument with him. A week later on Henry's fatal pony trek it is likely he had borrowed Syed Ali's pony because when the pony returned unescorted to Maymyo it was to Syed Ali's house it went, passing right by Henry's house. Ian Morshead speculated, but finally doubted his own speculation, that Syed Ali had arranged for Henry to be killed and this had been carried out by the Gurkha.|$|E

500|$|Mengele's {{research}} {{subjects were}} better fed and housed than other prisoners and temporarily {{safe from the}} gas chambers. He established a kindergarten for children that were the subjects of experiments, along with all Romani {{children under the age}} of six. The facility provided better food and living conditions than other areas of the camp, and even included a playground. When visiting his child subjects, he introduced himself as [...] "Uncle Mengele" [...] and offered them sweets. But he was also personally responsible for the deaths of an unknown number of victims that he killed via lethal injection, shootings, beatings, and through selections and deadly experiments. Lifton describes Mengele as sadistic, lacking empathy, and extremely antisemitic, believing the Jews should be eliminated entirely as an inferior and dangerous race. Mengele's son Rolf <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> later showed no remorse for his wartime activities.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Scuzzlebutt, [...] "Volcano" [...] included the first appearances of recurring characters Randy Marsh and Ned Gerblanski. In this first appearance, Randy is identified {{only as the}} South Park geologist, {{and it is only}} in the episode [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] that he is first introduced as Stan's father. Parker, who provides the voice of Randy Marsh, said the design, voice, and personality of the character are based on his real-life father, who works as a geologist for the United States Geological Survey. Parker <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> is very calm in real life and Randy's relaxed reaction to learning of the volcano—calmly sipping his coffee—is [...] "about how my dad would react to anything". The look of the Ned character was based on a drawing Parker made in high school, although the character did not originally have a voice box. The voice was inspired by a waitress who worked at a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Boulder, Colorado, where Parker and Stone would visit while attending the University of Colorado. The duo said they would go to the restaurant just to hear her voice, but that it was so low they would lose their appetite when she took their orders. Stone and Parker had trouble creating the right voice for the character; they tried putting the microphone directly on their throat, and also bought an actual voice box, but ultimately decided that the best way to provide the character's voice was with natural voice simulation.|$|E

2500|$|Pedro de Ayala, the Spanish envoy and Cabot's {{contemporary}} in London, {{described him}} {{in a letter to}} the Spanish Crown in 1498 as [...] "another Genoese like Columbus".

In 1476 Cabot was made a citizen of the Republic of Venice, which required a minimum of fifteen years' residency in the city; thus he must have lived in Venice since at least 1461.|$|E
