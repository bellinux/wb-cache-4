Human-induced disturbance (HDt) affecting the seaweed at time t is assumed to gradually vary over time.

Results indicate that annual nutrient release to the freshwater (1. 2 million tonnes of N and 0. 1 million tonnes of P in 2010) and marine aquatic environments (0. 3 million tonnes of N and 0. 05 million tonnes of P) increased less rapidly than fish production, mainly due to improving feed conversion. In the coming five decades, annual nutrient release to freshwater environments may increase to 1. 5 - 2. 1 million tonnes of N and 0. 1 - 0. 2 million tonnes of P, depending on the production scenario and assumptions on feed conversion and the share of integrated aquacultural production. At present, the global contribution of freshwater aquaculture to nutrient loading of rivers is small. This is the same conclusion reached for the assessment of nutrient export from shellfish aquaculture (Bouwman et al., 2011). However, particularly in Asia, nutrient loading from freshwater fish <b>production</b> and from <b>seaweed</b> and shellfish <b>production</b> is an important factor that should be accounted for when developing models for estimating river nutrient export. Compared to chicken meat and egg production, freshwater aquaculture is a rapidly growing and important cause of the anthropogenic acceleration of the N and P cycles {{in many parts of the}} world, and this is especially pronounced in Asia...|$|R
