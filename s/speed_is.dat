5|$|Tavares {{has been}} praised by his coaches {{for his ability}} to {{anticipate}} the play since he joined the OHL. A lack of speed had been the most common criticism of Tavares' play, something he spent his junior career attempting to improve.

30|$|Mean {{swimming}} <b>speeds</b> <b>were</b> analysed {{through a}} Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to verify {{whether they were}} normally distributed or not. A preliminary analysis of the results obtained by the symbolic analysis revealed that {{approximately half of the}} time was spent in the breaking state. To avoid a bias in the calculation, mean swimming <b>speeds</b> <b>were</b> calculated as the average of the non-zero instantaneous values for each individual track.

50|$|The extreme wind <b>speeds</b> <b>are</b> {{based on}} the 3 second average wind <b>speed.</b> Turbulence <b>is</b> {{measured}} at 15 m/s wind <b>speed.</b> This <b>is</b> the definition in IEC 61400-1 edition 2.|$|R
5000|$|The clutch {{was made}} by W.C. Lips, Model Z-32-S, and the {{transmission}} was an IHC Model F-54-D. This transmission had 5 forward and one reverse speed. The first <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> very low, fifth <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> direct.|$|R
5|$|If {{conditions}} are normal {{and a green}} light is shown, the athlete's coach – who is situated in a coaches' section lower down the inrun with a flag in hand – gives them the final signal to go; coaches may sometimes have to whistle or give a shouted confirmation in low-visibility conditions. Once given this signal, the athlete must commit to their jump within ten seconds or else risk disqualification: {{they are not allowed}} to exit the gate from whence they came. To begin descending the inrun, they drop down from the gate to a crouching position. <b>Speed</b> <b>is</b> rapidly picked up within seconds via built-in tracks, made from porcelain or ceramic, into which the skis are slotted. The athlete's streamlined crouch minimises air resistance along the inrun, and a further effort is made to reduce friction by not allowing the skis (which have wax applied to them) to bump too much against the sides of the tracks. <b>Speed</b> <b>is</b> measured from the table using a speed gun.|$|E

50|$|After 2 hours, 11 minutes, and 49 {{seconds of}} intense racing action, a winner was decided.

30|$|The {{stirring}} <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> set to 240 rpm for {{the dissolution}} and cross-linking steps for both chitosan and alginate films. This <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> chosen {{to overcome the}} gradual thickening of the polymer solutions {{as a result of}} cross-linking.|$|R
5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's <b>speed</b> <b>is</b> close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E
5|$|As {{the figures}} {{given in the}} table above were {{published}} before the turbines had been operational for a full year they are projected rather than recorded figures. Wind <b>speed</b> <b>is</b> not constant, therefore, a wind farm's annual energy production never achieves {{the sum of the}} generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 20–40%, with values at {{the upper end of the}} range achieved on particularly favourable sites. The expected capacity factor for Scout Moor Wind Farm, calculated from the company's projected figures, is 27%. The actual capacity factor calculated from data published by OFGEM for June 2016 to May 2017 was 25.20%.|$|E

The stocks of all firearms {{can be used in}} close combat. Lighter weapons, while being less powerful, allow the player to move around more quickly, increasing their chances of melee. Movement <b>speed</b> <b>is</b> maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which also allows them to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.|$|E

5|$|Domestic {{high-speed}} {{services on}} High Speed 1 are operated by Southeastern. Having been in planning since 2004, a preview {{service of the}} British Rail Class 395 trains, popularly known as Javelins, started in June 2009, and regular services began on 13 December 2009. The quickest journey time from Ashford to London St Pancras is 35 minutes, compared with 80 minutes for the service to London Charing Cross via Tonbridge. This service on Section 2 of the CTRL, known previously as CTRL-DS, {{was a factor in}} London's successful 2012 Olympic Bid, promising a seven-minute journey time from the Olympic Park at Stratford to the London terminus at St Pancras. Although the Class 395 has a maximum speed of , for timetabling purposes a 10% lower <b>speed</b> <b>is</b> assumed. These trains have faster acceleration than the Eurostar units.|$|E
5|$|In Fig.2, the {{corresponding}} {{part of the}} revolving orbit is mn with s as its centre of force. Assume that initially, {{the body in the}} static orbit starts out at right angles to the radius with speed V. The body in the revolving orbit must also start at right angles and assume its <b>speed</b> <b>is</b> v. In the case shown in Fig. 1., v > V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v < V. Also, the force may be directed away from the centre.|$|E
5|$|Python's {{developers}} {{strive to}} avoid premature optimization, and moreover, reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer a marginal {{increase in speed}} {{at the cost of}} clarity. When <b>speed</b> <b>is</b> important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or try using PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.|$|E

However, at the simulate rain, the raindrop speed mainly at 0. 2 - 5. 8 m/s in different time; it has one wave crest was 1 m/s.

5|$|Unlike the B-1A, the B-1B cannot reach Mach2+ speeds; {{its maximum}} <b>speed</b> <b>is</b> Mach1.25 (about 950mph or 1,530km/h at altitude), but its {{low-level}} speed increased to Mach0.92 (700mph, 1,130km/h). The {{speed of the}} current version of the aircraft is limited by the need to avoid damage to its structure and air intakes. To help lower its radar cross section (RCS), the B-1B uses serpentine air intake ducts (see S-duct) and fixed intake ramps, which limit its speed compared to the B-1A. Vanes in the intake ducts serve to deflect and shield radar emissions from the highly reflective engine compressor blades.|$|E
5|$|All Galilean moons have thin atmospheres with surface {{pressures}} {{in the range}} 0.01–1nbar, which in turn support substantial ionospheres with electron densities {{in the range of}} 1,000–10,000cm−3. The co-rotational flow of cold magnetospheric plasma is partially diverted around them by the currents induced in their ionospheres, creating wedge-shaped structures known as Alfvén wings. The interaction of the large moons with the co-rotational flow is similar to the interaction of the solar wind with the non-magnetized planets like Venus, although the co-rotational <b>speed</b> <b>is</b> usually subsonic (the speeds vary from 74 to 328km/s), which prevents the formation of a bow shock. The pressure from the co-rotating plasma continuously strips gases from the moons' atmospheres (especially from that of Io), and some of these atoms are ionized and brought into co-rotation. This process creates gas and plasma tori in the vicinity of moons' orbits with the Ionian torus being the most prominent. In effect, the Galilean moons (mainly Io) serve as the principal plasma sources in Jupiter's inner and middle magnetosphere. Meanwhile, the energetic particles are largely unaffected by the Alfvén wings and have free access to the moons' surfaces (except Ganymede's).|$|E
