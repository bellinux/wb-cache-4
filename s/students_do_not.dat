5|$|Students in Malawi have {{expressed}} {{high levels of}} dissatisfaction regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school. According to a survey of students in Malawi, most secondary <b>students</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe that the HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease. Although the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, {{there is still a}} significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas. In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students in their classes who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through friends or relatives, which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal. However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate that children who have been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience HIV/AIDS-based discrimination at school.|$|E
50|$|Current {{practice}} is {{to notify the}} student's parent if the <b>student</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> participate {{in the practice of}} religion. Reports can be made, for example, a one-time enrollment at school or in each case. After notification, the school must ensure that the <b>student</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> participate in these events. The school is responsible for student safety, even when the <b>student</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> participate in the school to organize a religious ceremony. The school organizes the student the opportunity for a period of other activities. In high school, notification is made by the student himself.|$|R

25|$|Controversies {{concerning}} {{gifted education}} are varied and often highly politicized. They are as basic as agreeing upon {{the appropriateness of}} the term 'gifted' or the definition of 'giftedness'. For example, does 'giftedness' refer to performance or potential (such as inherent intelligence)? Many <b>students</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> exhibit both at the same time.|$|E
25|$|However, {{increasing}} {{access to}} secondary education (grade 9–12) remains a major challenge, {{as evidenced by}} the low net enrollment rate of 24% at this level.

In addition, fewer girls than boys join secondary schools and, among those who do, fewer complete the 10th grade.|$|E

25|$|After {{allowing}} for the socio-economic status of the parents, children attending private schools are not as able as those at state schools. At the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) for example, after considering socioeconomic class, students at private schools underperformed those at state schools. One has, however, to be careful interpreting that data: {{it may be that}} such <b>students</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> underperform because they attend a private school, but that they attend a private school because they underperform. Some private Realschulen and Gymnasien have lower entry requirements than public Realschulen and Gymnasien.|$|E
25|$|Although age is not {{necessarily}} a prerequisite, many ballet <b>students</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> begin to dance en pointe earlier than approximately 12–14 years of age because bones in the feet are often too soft prior to that age and, in such cases, serious and permanent foot injuries could result from starting pointe work too early. The long bones in feet begin to harden within the ages of 8 to 14, dancing en pointe before one's bones have hardened can lead to trauma and growth-plate fractures that create deformed feet.|$|E

In Ethiopia few schools have {{clinical training}} facilities, {{and the government has}} prioritized opening more schools over improving existing colleges. There is concern in the United States that clinical training may suffer because many veterinary teaching hospitals are in financial trouble.|$|E

25|$|Similar to {{a long-running}} program {{in place at}} Winston Churchill High School, an advisor program was {{introduced}} in the fall of 2006. The program consists of an 8-minute session between the first two periods during which students of all grades meet with a teacher to whom they were randomly assigned {{at the beginning of the}} year. More personal than that of the counselling department, the program offers the opportunity for students to seek advice from an influential adult. Administrative duties, such as public announcements and the handing out of report cards and newsletters, is done in sessions. Advisors also make mid-semester phone-home reports to parents. Most <b>students</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have their advisor as a classroom instructor. In most circumstances, students will have the same advisor for all four years of high school.|$|E
25|$|The main {{argument}} against the concept of reservation is that it goes against the idea of merit and would dilute the IITs {{as one of the}} basic reasons behind their success is the excellent students they get via IIT-JEE. It is also being argued by the opposers that the irreparable damage caused during the childhood of the individual, cannot be rectified at a later stage. Also, the primary education provided by the government to the economically poor is highly inadequate, and this negligence by the government is the root cause of the problem. Statistics across the IIT's reveal that while about 4–5% of general category <b>students</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> complete their degree program, the number goes up to about 20% for reserved category students. This is used as an {{argument against}} reservations claiming that the reserved class candidates are not adequately prepared to face the challenging academic life in IITs.|$|E
25|$|The largest school, the College of Arts & Sciences, enrolls 35.2% of the OU-Norman students. The College of Arts & Sciences {{offers several}} programs, which include internships and most notably a joint archaeological program (with Saint Anselm College of Goffstown, New Hampshire) in Orvieto, Italy. The next largest school, The Price College of Business enrolls 13%. Other large colleges on the Norman campus include the College of Engineering with 10.6% and the College of Education, Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication, and College of Liberal Studies, each with {{approximately}} 6% {{of the student}} body. Smaller schools include the Colleges of Architecture and Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences, Earth and Energy, the Weitzenhoffer Family College of Fine Arts, and the College of Law.
