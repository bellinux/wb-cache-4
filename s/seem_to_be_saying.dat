6000|$|He had {{one long}} moment of violent hesitation, then yielded {{to the soft}} tugging of her hand, and followed. The passage-hall was dimly lighted, and they went upstairs into a front room, where the {{curtains}} were drawn, and the gas turned very low. Opposite the window were other curtains dividing {{off the rest of}} the apartment. As soon as the door was shut she put up her face and kissed him--evidently formula. What a room! Its green and beetroot colouring and the prevalence of cheap plush disagreeably affected him. Everything in it had that callous look of rooms which <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> to their occupants: [...] "You're here to-day and you'll be gone to-morrow." [...] Everything except one little plant, in a common pot, of maidenhair fern, fresh and green, looking {{as if it had been}} watered within the hour; in this room it had just the same unexpected touchingness that peeped out of the girl's matter-of-fact cynicism.|$|E

To say that I was disposed to humour the poor fellow would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that I thought his request fantastic. It was his situation, by no fault of his own, that was fantastic, and he {{was only trying to}} be natural. He watched me put away the letter, and when it had disappeared gave a soft sigh of relief. The sigh was natural, and yet it set me thinking. His general recoil from an immediate responsibility imposed by others might be wholesome enough; but if there was an old grievance on one side, was there not possibly a new-born delusion on the other? It would be unkind to withhold a reflection that might serve as a warning; so I told him, abruptly, that I had been an undiscovered spectator, the night before, of his exploits at roulette.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing, I think, {{could be}} more moving, more beautiful, than this close. This piece is just one long, soulful, sardonic laugh at human life. Its title might {{properly}} be 'Is Life a Failure?' and leave the five acts {{to play with the}} answer. I am not at all sure that the author meant to laugh at life. I only notice that he has done it. Without putting into words any ungracious or discourteous things about life, the episodes in the piece <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> all the time, inarticulately: 'Note what a silly poor thing human life is; how childish its ambitions, how ridiculous its pomps, how trivial its dignities, how cheap its heroisms, how capricious its course, how brief its flight, how stingy in happinesses, how opulent in miseries, how few its prides, how multitudinous its humiliations, how comic its tragedies, how tragic its comedies, how wearisome and monotonous its repetition of its stupid history through the ages, with never the introduction of a new detail; how hard it has tried, from the Creation down, to play itself upon its possessor as a boon and has never proved its case in a single instance!' ...|$|E

5000|$|Contrary to {{the meaning}} of the title, the theme of the album is {{actually}} full of doubt and the songs <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that everything is what you make of it — heaven or hell. The song [...] "Enlightenment" [...] contains the words: [...] "I'm {{in the here and now}} and I'm meditating/ And still I'm suffering but that's my problem/ Enlightenment, don't know what it is". [...] "So Quiet in Here" [...] is a continuation of the song [...] "Into the Mystic" [...] from the Moondance album.

Throughout history, famous explorers and travellers journeyed to India from China, Japan, Tibet, Indonesia and Europe, because India has always been known as the land of spirituality. India’s saints and sages developed a universal spiritual path which can guide the entire human race. India has always exalted the ideal of non-violence.

40|$|As I {{tried to}} {{organize}} my thoughts to fit my title, I realized that I don't know where organic chemistry is going. If I did, I'd be {{out trying to}} get there before everyone else does. So I thought about how to predict where it might go. How do you predict where anything is going? If it is nearly at a standstill, it is difficult indeed to predict where it Is going. If it is moving, the safest prediction {{is that it will}} keep moving, at least for a while, in the same direction. Many of our chemical pundits <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> "Organic chemistry isn't moving much these days; it's a staid, old, finished, complete science, and the real action is elsewhere. " Well, if this is so, if it is really at a standstill, I will only be able to predict that it will remain at a standstill. But is this true? Is organic chemistry really not moving? Clearly, the best way to decide is {{to look at some of}} the things that are happening, to see if there is still a faint pulse of life left. This, then, is what I want to do: examine some of the recent trends and developments, which I have found interesting, indeed, exciting. At the same time, I would like to comment on some general problems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This article {{proposes a}} study of Henry David Thoreau’s Walden (1854) {{in the light of}} Nietzsche’s ideas of ubermensch, self, {{and the role of the}} artist to show that the quest of a ‘romantic ’ artist like Thoreau as well as an ‘anti-romantic ’ like Nietzsche, to use J. Hillis Miller’s terms, is a quest of the {{discovery}} and creation of the self. It is argued that the mentioned writers ’ main concern is a glorified self with the ability to transcend conventional morality, rather than the appearance or disappearance of God. The disappearance of God seems to be the necessary condition for the birth of the (myth of) the Superman who sees a universe without God, and rather than finding it meaningless and empty, creates his own meaning and true self. The self recreates itself through art, and this desire acts as a propelling force in Walden and Nietzsche’s writings where their art is the desire to survive and recognize the self, for art makes survival possible by converting the horror of a golden world into a pleasing realization of the capacities of the self. Nietzsche and Thoreau <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that life becomes meaningful only if one’s true self or the will to live is realized and recreated; if one can achieve a higher state of consciousness...|$|E

40|$|The current {{popularity}} of animal behaviorists comes in good {{part from the}} comfort and assurance their discoveries offer to humanity. It is, after all, comforting to think that our sins are only animal sins (original sin if you wish) {{and that we are}} no more than naked apes momentarily disoriented by our jerry-built civilization. We want to believe that the beastliness in human nature is beastliness in the primordial sense and not some dark angelic flaw, to trust that we have not escaped so far from our ancestral genes to be due for an early extinction. Perhaps all that is needed, the popular exponents of ethology <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> is to understand the adaptedness of our behavior and to learn to operate within its constraints. These writers-Robert Ardrey (1961), Konrad Lorenz (1966), Desmond Morris (1967), Anthony Storr (1968), and others- speak of territorial and aggressive in-stincts which long ago originated as stereotyped, strictly inherited behavioral repertories in our primate ancestors. The instincts are said to survive today in man in slightly abated and more diffuse form, hedged in by social conventions that tend to minimize their overt effects. Of course nothing so starkly Darwinian could go unchallenged for very long. The contrary view has been argued by those of liberal humanist per-suasion, such as Edmund Leach (1968) and Ashley Montagu (1965), and also by animal behaviorists with experience in the raw source material, including S. A. Barnett (1967) and Peter Klopfer (1968). These critics declare that there are no such things as unitary instincts, or drives, that persist through phylogenetic lineages as do vertebrae and eardrums. They point out that territorial behavior and aggression are not universal in lower animals and that when such traits do occur they are expressed in myriad ways, performing functions that shift subtly from species to species. They condemn as facil...|$|E
40|$|In the United States, {{women are}} {{increasingly}} praised for having excellent skills for leadership and, in fact, women, more than men, manifest leadership styles associated with effective performance as leaders. Nevertheless, more people prefer male than female bosses, {{and it is}} more difficult for women than men to become leaders and to succeed in male-dominated leadership roles. This mix of apparent advantage and disadvantage that women leaders experience reflects the considerable progress toward gender equality that has taken place in both attitudes and behavior, coupled with the lack of complete attainment of this goal. A good introduction to the complexities of women’s cur-rent status as leaders can follow from contemplating jour-nalists ’ discussions of this topic. The most striking aspect of some recent statements in newspapers and magazines is that they are favorable to women’s abilities as leaders. Some journalists <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that women have arrived or are arriving at their rightful position as leaders. Consider the following statement from Business Week: “After years of analyzing what makes leaders most effective and figur-ing out who’s got the Right Stuff, management gurus now know how to boost the odds of getting a great executive: Hire a female ” (Sharpe, 2000, p. 74). Not only did Business Week announce that women have the “Right Stuff, ” but also Fast Companymaintained that “[t]he future of business de-pends on women ” (Heffernan, 2002, p. 9). Business Week followed with a cover story on the new gender gap, stating, “Men could become losers in a global economy that values mental power over might ” (Conlin, 2003, p. 78). Readers of these articles might conclude that contemporary women are well prepared for leadership and have some advantages that men do not possess. Now examine statements of a different sort. Consider, for example, a New York Times editorial clearly stating that being a woman is a decided disadvantage for leadership: Alice H. Eagly, Department of Psychology, Northwester...|$|E
