The ladies' reading-room, with pale satin and plush hangings, contained files of newspapers and writing-desks. The drawing room was in the style of Louis XVI., with its walls covered with salmon-tinted satin damask, embroidered portieres, furniture in the Adams and Chippendale styles, and fawn-colored Axminster carpet. The Gilt Room was a reproduction of the Gilt Room in London's Holland House, in Elizabethan architecture, with carved wainscotting, heraldic devices, gold-crown ornaments, antique furniture in natural cherry and gold, fire-places, English parquet floors, Flemish chandeliers, and plush curtains embroidered with fleur-de-lys.|$|E
