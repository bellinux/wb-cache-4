Stellites posses high corrosion resistance and wear resistance properties [...] This study investigates the Stellite deposition process and machinability of <b>Stellite</b> 6 <b>deposited</b> on steel subtrate. <b>Stellite</b> 6 was <b>deposited</b> onto a 4140 bar using a plasma transfer arc (PTA) system and machinability was assessed {{on the basis of}} surface roughness. A series of turning operations have been carried out on a conventional lathe using coated carbide inserts and surface roughness was evaluated by Stylus type Surtronic 3 + instrument. The values of surface roughness were plotted against different cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut to display the results in graphical forms. Optimal cutting regimes were established against the best values of surface roughness...|$|R

Aspects related to both the deposition process and the topography, such as roughness, chemical composition, hardness and wear resistance were investigated. Stellite 6, Stellite 31 and Stellite 31 + 10 % AISI 316 L coatings were deposited and the effects of composition were analyzed to identify the optimum process conditions.

Microstructural characterization {{was carried out}} on Stellite 6 coatings and hardness and chemical composition were measured by vicker's hardness tester and optical emission spectrometer respectively. The impact of alloying elements in <b>Stellite</b> 6 <b>deposits</b> and fusion line of Stellite 6 and {{stainless steel}} were analyzed by electron dispersive spectroscopy line scan. It was observed that dilution of Iron in PTA welding <b>deposit</b> in <b>Stellite</b> 6 is below 2 % and hardness of more than 600 HV 0. 3 was obtained. Microstructure of Stellite 6 consisted of Co - solid solution matrix with dendritic structure and interdendritic eutectic carbides which provides the hardness. Pin-on-disc tests were carried out at 400 Â°C and characterized using scanning electron microscope of worn out surfaces. The wear mechanism was identified as delamination and abrasive wear in the worn-out surfaces as observed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 This {{paper is}} a {{metallurgical}} {{study of the}} microstructure of a cobalt base hard facing alloy to determine the cause for inconsistant wear properties. Wear tests on a <b>Stellite</b> 6 alloy, <b>deposited</b> using oxyacetylene welding techniques, resulted {{in a wide range}} of weight losses. Microscopic examination has revealed the probable cause to be variations in carbon content after welding. Cooling rates may also be a contributing factor. The "as received" structure of the Stellite alloy is a matrix of fine carbides surrounding large dendrites of cobalt rich material. The use of a reducing flame during welding causes an increase in carbon resulting in a structure of massive, hard, and brittle primary carbides in a soft but tough cobalt matrix containing eutectic microconstituents and free graphite. This structure appears to be the most desirable one for a superior wearing material when subjected to dry grinding abrasion...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stellite</b> 6 was <b>deposited</b> by laser {{cladding}} {{of two different}} steel substrates (nickel superalloy and mild steel). The chemical compositions and microstructures of these coatings were characterized by atomic absorption spectroscopy, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The microhardness of the coatings was measured and the wear mechanism of the coatings was examined using a pin-on-plate (reciprocating) wear testing machine. The results showed less cracking and pore development for Stellite 6 coatings applied to the mild steel (MS) substrate.

40|$|A {{detailed}} microstructural {{study of}} <b>Stellite</b> 6 coating <b>deposited</b> {{on a low}} carbon ferritic steel substrate using preplaced powder method and low power Nd:YAG pulse laser is performed. The grain structure and solidification texture of the coating are investigated by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the effect of consecutive pulses on the microstructure of the coating is examined. The orientation relationship (OR) at coating/substrate interface and the solid state phase transformation in heat-affected zone are studied {{as well as the}} Vickers microhardness profile measurement in order to support the microstructural observations. An important conclusion is reached that the shape of solidification front during pulsed laser cladding is similar to the shape of solidification front during continuous cladding with a doubled laser beam scanning speed. Further, OIM reveals the Greninger-Troiano OR between the face centered cubic coating and bcc substrate grains. It is concluded that at the moment of solidification epitaxial growth of the grains in the coating occur on the austenitic grains of the substrate and that an austenite-ferrite transformation occurs in the heat-affected zone upon subsequent cooling. ...|$|R

The surface topography data showed that the surface roughness for the coating on P 22 steel was much lower than for the P 91 steel substrate. It is concluded that the residual C content for the deposit on P 22 was higher, mainly because the lower concentration of strong carbide formers, compared to P 91, reduced the extent of carbon loss in the deposit...|$|R
40|$|Electron microscopy, {{mechanical}} hardness measurements, {{and wear}} experiments {{have been carried}} out on 316 stainless steel laser coated with Co based Stellite alloys. It has been found that with optimum laser parameters a pore less coating with a hardness of 11 - 3 GPa can be attained. Detailed analysis indicates that solid solution hardening by W and Cr, dislocation-dislocation interactions, and dispersion hardening owing to the metal carbides and the Co- 3 W precipitates are responsible for the high hardness. In accordance with theoretical predictions, cutting of the DO 19 ordered Co- 3 W precipitates was not observed. All these microstructural features contribute to the mechanical properties, on the basis of which the hardness can be successfully explained. An important parameter which influences these mechanical properties is the low dilution of the coating by the substrate. It is this aspect, together with the well defined and controllable processing parameters, which makes laser coating of powders superior to other deposition techniques for <b>depositing</b> <b>Stellite</b> layers.

40|$|The {{capability}} of manufacturing coatings is of central importance in engineering design. Many components require nowadays {{the application of}} additional layers, to enhance mechanical properties and protect against hostile environments. S upersonic Laser Deposition (S LD) is a novel coating method, based upon Cold Spray (CS) principles. In this technique the deposition velocities can be significantly lower than those require d for effective bonding in CS applications. The additi on of l aser heat energy permits {{a change in the}} t hermodynamic experience of impacting particles, thereby offering a greater opportunity for metallurgical bonding at lower velocities compared to the CS process tec hnology. The work reported in this paper demonstrates the ability of the SLD process to deli ver hard facing materials to engineering surfaces. Stelli te - 6 has been deposited on low carbon steel tubes over a range of process parameters, determining the appropriate target power and traverse speeds for coating deposition.

40|$|Stellites are cobalt (Co) -based {{superalloys}} {{available in}} two main combinations: (a) a Tungsten (W) group with composition of Co-Cr-W-C, and (b) a Molybdenum (Mo) group containing Co-Cr-Mo-C. Stellites possess outstanding corrosion resistance, oxidation resistance, wear resistance, heat resistance, and low magnetic permeability. Components made of stellites {{work well in}} highly corrosive environments and maintain these advantageous properties at elevated temperatures. Components made of stellites are widely used in the oil and gas, automotive, nuclear power, paper and pulp, chemical and petrochemical, refineries, automobile, aerospace and aircraft industries. By virtue of their nonmagnetic, anticorrosive and non-reactivity to human body-fluid properties, stellites are used in medical surgery and in surgical tools, tooth and bone implants and replacements, heart valves, and in heart pacemakers. The hardness range of stellites is from 32 to 55 HRC, which makes stellites brittle materials {{but they have a}} low Youngâs modulus. Due to their high hardness, dense but non-homogeneous molecular structure and lower thermal conductivity, machining operations for parts made of stellites are extremely difficult, categorising stellites as difficult-to-machine materials like Ti-alloys, inconels, composites and stainless steels. Usually, machine components made of stellites are produced by a deposition method onto steel substrates instead of expensive solid stellite bars. The rough surfaces of <b>deposited</b> <b>stellites</b> are then finished by grinding, rather than some other economic machining process, which is costly and time-consuming, making stellite products very expensive. This paper provides a basic overview of stellites applicable in engineering, their significances and specific applications, advantages and disadvantages in respect of machining processes. A brief review on experimental research on economically rational cutting parameters for turning operations of Stellite 6 using coated carbide inserts is presented in this paper. Interesting facts on the residual stresses induced by machining processes in Stellite 6 are revealed and analysed. The microhardness variation of machined surfaces of stellite 6 using different tool geometries is investigated in this research review. Â  It is revealed that coated carbide inserts with a medium-size nose radius perform better in respect of hardness changes and heat generation, producing minimum phase changes on machined surfaces of stellite 6...|$|R
