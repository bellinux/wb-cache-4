60|$|East of my bean-field, {{across the}} road, lived Cato Ingraham, slave of Duncan Ingraham, Esquire, gentleman, of Concord village, who built his slave a house, {{and gave him}} {{permission}} to live in Walden Woods;--Cato, not Uticensis, but Concordiensis. Some {{say that he was}} a Guinea Negro. There are a few who remember his little patch among the walnuts, which he let grow up till he should be old and need them; but a younger and whiter speculator got them at last. He too, however, occupies an equally narrow house at present. Cato's half-obliterated cellar-hole still remains, though known to few, being concealed from the traveller by a fringe of pines. It is now filled with the <b>smooth</b> <b>sumach</b> (Rhus glabra), and one of the earliest species of goldenrod (Solidago stricta) grows there luxuriantly.|$|E
