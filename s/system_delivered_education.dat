Distant education and computer based learning (CBL) are considered as existing practice of text communication in education and as models for further developments. Particularly CBL teaching and learning strategies (i. e. drill and practice, programmed instruction, simulation, learner oriented information systems, interactive programming) are taken as example of existing and successfully used text communication. From the experience in CBL it is derived that the present viewdata system itself will not be appropriate as an interactive computer <b>system</b> for <b>delivering</b> <b>education</b> to the learner.

40|$|Open and Distance Learning (ODL) {{has been}} widely {{discussed}} by academicians and Information Technology (IT) personnel’s in recent years. In an ODL system, E-Learning Delivery Platform (ELDP) plays an integral part that ensures learning materials delivered to users in {{the most effective and}} efficient manner. Identifying the selection criteria’s is very important and vital for a suitable ELDP system that will enhance and enrich the ODL. At the same time, evaluation formats or check-sheets can be developed using the criteria’s to evaluate various ELDP providers by the ODL provider.

40|$|Among {{developing}} {{member countries}} (DMCs), Indonesia and the Philippines rank fairly {{high in the}} distribution of real GDP per capita in PPP dollars while Bangladesh ranks much lower. In terms of aggregate schooling, the Philippines has secondary and tertiary enrollment rates that are substantially higher, while Indonesia has rates that are substantially lower, than that predicted based on all DMCs and their respective real products per capita. The Philippines also has expected grades for synthetic cohorts that are substantially above the overall mean for DMCs. In terms of public expenditures on education, all three countries have about the same percentage of GNP invested in education, a little over 2 percent, which is significantly below the level predicted by the experience of all DMCs given their respective real products per capita. There has been considerable public pressure for decentralization of education in DMCs in recent years. This pressure has been driven largely by fiscal constraints but has also been motivated by concerns over the effectiveness of a centralized <b>system</b> for <b>delivering</b> <b>education</b> services. The three country studies provide a rich characterization of the evolving - and in certain respects, rapidly changing - education systems in these DMCs. ...|$|R
40|$|One {{of several}} {{possible}} <b>systems</b> for <b>delivering</b> special <b>education</b> services, a consulting teacher approach seeks {{to manage and}} educate handicapped children in regular elementary classrooms. Vermont has adopted this approach for certain handicapped children because it is less costly and disruptive, avoids labeling and extensive testing, provides normal peer models, and trains regular teachers in special education. During a 2 -year graduate program, students preparing to be consulting teachers receive training in the individualization of instruction, analysis of behavior, and research as well as supervised experience in consulting with and training teachers through services to 32 handicapped children. The training program is evaluated mainly by services students provide to handicapped children. (An 18 -item bibliography is included.) (Author) I I BEST COPY AVAILABLE...|$|R
40|$|While {{decentralization}} {{of education}} in DMCs has largely been driven by fiscal constraints, {{it has also been}} motivated by concerns about the effectiveness of a centralized <b>system</b> in <b>delivering</b> <b>education</b> services. The statistics are revealing: while virtually all DMCs have made impressive gains in expanding the coverage of primary schooling, enrollment rates remain generally low at secondary and tertiary levels, particularly for children coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. The quality of education is also a cause for concern, judging by dropout and grade repetition rates, and international comparisons of achievement test scores. Another cause for concern is whether the curricula used are appropriate, especially for higher education. To varying degrees, DMCs have adopted some elements of decentralization in their education systems. These include devolution of authority and responsibility for schools from central to local levels, increased local financing of schools, decentralization of school functions, and reforms to the incentive structure of schools and their teachers. However, it is not often clear that the measures adopted have led to improvements in education. There is not much evidence that decentralization has been successful in improving education in DMCs, perhaps in part because decentralization measures in most countries so far have been incomplete. There is still no clear understanding of the economic and institutional conditions under which decentralization leads to more effective education...|$|R
40|$|Is {{access to}} higher {{education}} really open to all? How does the experience of higher education vary between social groups? Are graduate jobs harder to find for some than for others? The transformation of higher education from an elite experience to a mass <b>system</b> <b>delivering</b> advanced <b>education</b> to a socially mixed clientele has often been conflated with a process of equalization through wider access. But is this really the case? Andy Furlong and Fred Cartmel fear not, arguing that young people from social and economically disadvantaged families suffer from unfair access arrangements, have a poorer student experience and have limited contact with their middle class peers. Moreover, students from less advantaged families who successfully complete their courses tend to face greater difficulty securing graduate jobs and may be left with higher levels of debt. Taking a holistic approach that focuses on access {{to higher education}}, experiences in higher education and gains derived from participation, the book explores the barriers that impede the progress of young people from less advantaged families and outlines the various forms of stratification that help limit the possibilities for social mobility through education. Higher Education and Social Justice provides essential reading for anyone who has an interest in higher education or a concern for social justice, including lecturers, administrators and policy makers in higher education...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Distance {{learning}} {{has come a}} long way since Sir Isaac Pitman initiated the first corre-spondence course in the early 1840 ’s. Today the number of working adults who are returning to the classroom is growing rapidly as a result of changing market conditions and technological develop-ments. These dynamics call for new and innovative systems for providing instructional content to the business community. To meet these challenges the traditional classroom approach to business instruction is giving away to a more holistic learning paradigm where both the pedagogical and andragogical focus is on knowledge acquisition and management. The one-size fits all educational approach of the past is being replaced by customized learning systems. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a web-based learning <b>system</b> for <b>delivering</b> management <b>education.</b> This learning net replaces the three pillars of traditional instruction – fixed time, fixed location and fixed learning pace – with a more flexible and customized approach for meeting the demands of working adult...|$|R
40|$|Education renders {{people with}} certain {{capabilities}} that prepare them {{to contribute to}} the social and economic development of the nation. Such capabilities turn them into human capital which, according to development economists, raises productivity when increased. Following an exhaustive review of literature on education research, this paper, however, aims at exploring the effectiveness of Bangladesh’s present <b>education</b> <b>system</b> in <b>delivering</b> quality <b>education</b> as well as reckoning the prospect of establishing a knowledge-based society in the nation. This paper, being qualitative in nature, reveals that the nation has achieved an exemplary success in primary education as regards increased enrolment rate, while the enrolment rate is not satisfactory in secondary schooling and the tertiary education is expanding. However, the quality of education imparted at all the primary, secondary and tertiary levels is not up to the mark to create a strong human capital and reckon the prospect of knowledge-based society in the country. A number of reform measures are required to be undertaken in order to ensure quality education and create an effective knowledge base in the nation...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable, {{low carbon}} Higher Education (HE) {{teaching}} systems {{are part of}} the carbon reduction strategies needed to meet the targets set for HE institutions. Significant changes in the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have led to new methods in teaching and learning, blending conventional and ICT-based teaching models. Little is known about their environmental impacts. Few studies have considered the whole system carbon-based environmental impacts of different <b>systems</b> of <b>delivering</b> Higher <b>Education.</b> One notable exception was the Factor 10 Visions study ‘Towards Sustainable Higher Education’, which offered an exemplar methodology for conducting an environmental impact audit/assessment of HE courses/modules. Building on this, the SusTEACH project examined the transformative effect of ICTs on HE teaching models, and developed a methodology to assess the main carbon-based environmental impacts of HE courses/modules, and to provide estimations of the energy and carbon impacts associated with different HE teaching models. This methodology as outlined here has supported the SusTEACH project research analysis of over thirty HE courses and modules, and the SusTEACH toolkit available from OpenLearn Module: The environmental impact of teaching and learning...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Continuing {{professional}} development {{is an integral}} component of modern medical practice, yet traditional educational methods are impractical for many Primary Care Physicians. Web-based programs may fulfill the requirements of busy practitioners who have difficulty attending formal education sessions. Methods: We piloted {{the use of a}} learning management <b>system</b> to <b>deliver</b> asthma <b>education</b> materials to Primary Care Physicians in both Australia and Italy in their native languages. Each group of Physicians accessed an education module which contained content pages, self-tests, a quiz and a survey. Details of how the Physicians used the system, their preferences and performance on the assessment were monitored. Results: The learning management system was well received by both Italian and Australian Physicians. Thirty-eight (18 Australian, 20 Italian) Physicians used the system. Participants visited an average of 8. 8 pages, with a mean time per hit of 2. 9 min. Formative assessment was undertaken by 63. 2 % and summative assessment by 68. 4 % of participants. There were no substantial differences in performance between Physicians from both countries. Italian physicians tended to use the system after hours whereas Australian Physicians appear to do so between patient visits. Conclusions: Simple web-based systems are suitable for delivering educational materials to Primary Care Physicians in a manner likely to be used...|$|R

40|$|Through an {{examination}} of librarians’ contributions to the PEPTalk research project, this article highlights roles for information professionals at various stages {{in the design and}} clinical implementation of an information <b>system</b> that <b>delivers</b> patient <b>education.</b> The Personal Education Plan (PEPTalk) was a collaborative, multi-disciplinary research project (2005 - 2006) based at the University Health Network’s Princess Margaret Hospital that designed an information system to provide web-based health information resources to both patients and clinicians under a shared umbrella of patient education. This article provides an overview of the PEPTalk project methods and outcomes, and documents the contributions of librarians throughout the design and clinical implementation stages of the project. Librarians brought expertise about information seeking behaviours of both patients and clinicians to the project; liaised across institutional and professional boundaries; developed a classification system for online learning objects, and educated project team about information and health literacies. The contributions of librarians on the PEPTalk project illustrate the need for boundary spanners, information brokers, knowledge translators, and change champions in the design and implementation of patient education delivery systems. There are new roles emergent at the intersections of clinical practice and health information provision. There is a need for the traditional skills and expertise of librarians and other information professionals in tailoring health information. Yet the design and implementation of patient education systems also require the development of new skills and the application of advanced information literacy as it pertains to both clinicians and patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{education}} is to provide {{the knowledge and skills}} young people need to access economic, political, and social opportunities. Egypt has made substantial progress in ensuring that nearly all youth enter school. However, a persistently marginalized population, primarily of female youth in rural Upper Egypt, remains highly disadvantaged in accessing education. Egypt must implement alternative routes to education for those past school age, as well as policies such as conditional cash transfers to bring marginalized youth into the school system. Attending school is the means to obtaining an education, but not the end of education in and of itself. Egypt is failing to provide its youth with a high-quality education. Changes in pedagogy and curricula are vital to ensuring better educational and labor market outcomes. Moreover, the structure of the education system and the distribution of educational resources reinforce existing inequalities rather than providing opportunities for all youth. Key Messages • Access to school has improved, but some youth, especially females in rural Upper Egypt, remain outside the school system and are increasingly marginalized. • The Egyptian school <b>system</b> is <b>delivering</b> lowquality <b>education</b> that is irrelevant to the labor market. • Problems with repetition, absenteeism, and drop out reduce the efficiency of the education system. • Unequal distribution of resources in the education system reinforces and increases existing inequalities in Egyptian society.
