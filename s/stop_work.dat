5|$|Most workers {{accepted}} {{the reduction in}} pay, but the firemen and those who ran the freight trains resolved to <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> in protest. However, the number of unemployed along the line was so great, owing to the ongoing economic problems, {{that the company had}} no difficulty replacing the absent strikers. In response, the strikers resolved to occupy portions of the rail line, and to stop trains from passing unless the company rescinded the wage cuts.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of the season, Groening and Brooks pitched a live-action spin-off series centered in Krusty the Clown (expected to be portrayed by Dan Castellaneta) entitled Krusty (although they began planning the series since 1992). Groening and Michael Weithorn wrote a pilot episode where Krusty moved to Los Angeles and got his own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers. Eventually, the contract negotiations fell apart and Groening decided to <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> on the project.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Matt Groening and James L. Brooks began {{planning}} a live-action spin-off from The Simpsons that revolved around Krusty and would star Dan Castellaneta as Krusty. They pitched the series in 1994. Groening and Michael Weithorn wrote a pilot script where Krusty moved to Los Angeles {{and got his}} own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty {{lived in a house}} on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers.

5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office, McElroy formed a panel to {{investigate}} ABM issues. The panel examined the Army and Air Force projects, {{and found the}} Zeus program considerably more advanced than Wizard. McElroy told the Air Force to <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> on ABM missiles and use Wizard funding {{for the development of}} long-range radars for early warning and raid identification. These were already under development as the BMEWS network. The Army was handed the job of actually shooting down the warheads, and McElroy gave them free hand to develop an ABM system as they saw fit, free of any range limitations.|$|E
5|$|In April 2005, New York {{reached a}} {{settlement}} with Super Steel to close the rehabilitation project for $5.5 million, requiring them to <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> on the project, cover remaining costs, and move four unfinished trains into storage at a nearby industrial park. This settlement, when added to the $64.8 million previously spent, brought total project expenses—the results of which were three rehabilitated trainsets and four others {{in various states of}} repair—to $70.3 million. In 2007, Amtrak and New York settled their own lawsuit, with Amtrak paying New York $20 million. Amtrak and New York further agreed to commit $10 million each to implement track improvements in the Empire Corridor. New York, which was paying $150,000 per year to store the unused trains, auctioned off its four surplus Turboliners in 2012 for $420,000, including spare parts; scrapping began in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the German {{conquest of}} Norway in April 1940 further eroded {{any chance of}} {{completing}} Graf Zeppelin. Now responsible for defending Norway's long coastline and numerous port facilities, the Kriegsmarine urgently needed large numbers of coastal guns and anti-aircraft batteries. During a naval conference with Hitler on 28 April 1940, Admiral Erich Raeder proposed halting all work on Graf Zeppelin, arguing that {{even if she was}} commissioned by the end of 1940, final installation of her guns would need another ten months or more (her original fire control system had been sold to the Soviet Union under an earlier trade agreement). Hitler consented to the <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> order, allowing Raeder to have Graf Zeppelins 15cm guns removed and transferred to Norway. The carrier's heavy flak armament of twelve 10.5cm guns had already been diverted elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|When Leyland Motors {{joined with}} British Motor Holdings and Rover and Jaguar became {{corporate}} partners these projects were cancelled to prevent internal competition with Jaguar products.

25|$|On December 14, City Engineer Commissioner Colonel William Ludlow issued verbal {{orders to}} George M. Beale, D.C. {{superintendent}} of roads, {{to begin work}} on extending North Capitol Street. Three days later, the D.C. Superior Court issued an injunction stopping all work on the road. Although subsequent events are unclear, later congressional testimony suggested that the injunction was served only on Commissioner Webb, not all three commissioners. Webb may have referred the injunction to the District's assistant counsel, H.E. Davis, but neither individual informed Ludlow. On December 23, seven workmen entered the cemetery and tore down fences, chopped down 12 trees, and uprooted shrubs. The cemetery superintendent, Henry Winckelman, attempted to stop them {{but was unable to}} do so. Davis allegedly told Ludlow of the injunction late in the afternoon on December 23, and Ludlow verbally told Beale to <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> a few hours later. Officers of the PHC complained to city officials, and on December 29 Commissioner Wheatley issued a written order to Beale to <b>stop</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

Tenants made significant alterations {{to the dining room}} without permits, and the City of Downey had to issue several <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> orders and citations.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1998, a newspaper reported that the Federal Ministry of Transport had issued an order to <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> on {{the southern part of}} the new line so that the work program could be examined. The northern section that was being built along with the A71 was not affected. After the Federal Ministry of Transport initially stopped pre-construction activities in July 1999 as a result of tight budgets, some work, mainly consisting of pre-construction work, was carried out in 2003 and 2004.|$|E
25|$|Philip II succeeded Charles V in 1558, and {{commissioned}} the Genovese engineer Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino {{to continue the}} improvements. El Fratino decided that the traverse should be abandoned, and {{what had been done}} on Calvi's zigzag wall should be demolished. Instead, an upper wall should continue the line of the lower wall {{from the top of the}} cliff to the crest of the rock. Work was stopped on the traverse, but Philip II's chief engineer Tibúrcio Spanucchi refused to <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> on the zigzag wall, which was eventually finished in 1599, and forms the upper portion of the Charles V Wall.

25|$|The spire of the Square Church, not {{far from}} the minster {{at the bottom of the}} town, paid for by the carpet {{manufacturing}} Crossley family, is all that remains of the Gothic Congregational church built by Joseph James in 1856–58 as a rival design to All Souls', Haley Hill. The building was closed in 1969 and arsonists caused severe damage to the building two years later leading to its partial demolition. The rather comic story of the rival spires runs that the two buildings' towers were nearing completion simultaneously; the architects were ordered to <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> within a few feet of the top of the spires to see who would finish first. After some time, the Crossleys lost patience and finished their spire at , prompting the immediate completion of the rival building one foot higher. The neighbouring and earlier (Georgian) Square Chapel (1772) survived a hundred years of use as a church hall and Sunday school for the larger church: it is currently an arts centre.|$|E
25|$|The two {{aircraft}} {{types that}} used the Peregrine, the Westland Whirlwind {{and the second}} prototype of the Gloster F9/37, were both twin-engine designsthe prototype F9/37 had used the Bristol Taurus radial engine. The Air Ministry requirement for the F9/37, a cannon-armed fighter (the Hurricane and Spitfire were armed with machine guns only at this point), was curtailed {{and there was no}} further progress with the design. The Whirlwind, despite having excellent low-altitude performance, proved uneconomical compared with single-engined fighters, and also suffered {{as a consequence of the}} Peregrine's reliability problems. Low production rates of the Peregrine caused delays in delivery for squadron use. In August 1940 Ernest Hives, head of the Rolls-Royce aero engine division, wrote to Air Chief Marshal Wilfrid Freeman expressing his wish to <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> on the Peregrine, Vulture, and another engine development project, the Rolls-Royce Exe, to concentrate efforts on the Merlin and Griffon, but Freeman disagreed and stated that Peregrine production should continue.|$|E
25|$|Sierra On-Line {{was founded}} by Roberta and Ken Williams in 1980. Roberta had also been {{inspired}} by Colossal Cave Adventure, and unable to find similar games of that type, wrote her own detective story based loosely on Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None and the board game Clue. Once she had completed its design, she had convinced Ken to <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> on a FORTRAN compiler he had been developing as to bring her game to light on the Apple II home computer. The game, initially titled Hi-Res Adventure, was ultimately released as Mystery House; Mystery House was the first adventure game to feature graphics, using vector graphics atop a simple two-word command parser. The Williamses initially sold the game on their own, achieving reasonable sales. Though Ken wanted to continue developing business software, they ultimately decided to continue to develop games, forming On-Line Systems in 1980, which they would eventually rename as Sierra On-Line.|$|E

25|$|On 8 September 2015, it was {{reported}} that Lockheed Martin would protest the award; on the same day it was also disclosed that AM General had decided not to file a protest. Any work that would be performed under the contract stopped during the review period. On 15 December 2015 the Government Accountability Office GAO dismissed Lockheed Martin's protest because the company on 11 December 2015 decided to file a “Notice of Post-Award Bid Protest” with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims; according to a source with knowledge of the procedures, it is uncommon for a company to file with the court close to a GAO protest decision. Immediately after the GAO dismissed the protest, the Army instructed Oshkosh to resume work on the JLTV order. Lockheed Martin filed a preliminary injunction on 17 December, stating that new Army-supplied information related to the contract emerged {{toward the end of the}} GAO's protest process that was not considered before their ruling and no deadline extension was granted. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims denied Lockheed Martin's request to <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> while the lawsuit was pending, allowing Oshkosh to continue work during the process. The company withdrew its protest in the Court of Federal Claims on 17 February 2016.|$|E
25|$|The special {{subcommittee}} met for {{the first}} time on March 3, 1888, and heard testimony in the matter its first day. PHC director L.H. Schneider testified about the organization's 1860 charter, the 1886 amendments to the charter, and Section 3's bar against the construction of roads in the cemetery. Schneider also testified that the city commissioners were well aware of Section 3's prohibition on new roads. City Commissioner Webb reviewed for the subcommittee the city's initial attempt to extend North Capitol Street in late 1886. He noted that the commissioners did not approve construction at that time, as federal law appeared to bar it. Webb claimed that the GESPHC approached the city with news of the subdivision and their willingness to allow the city to cut the road. The city commissioners told the GESPHC that the organization had no authority to subdivide the cemetery or donate any burial ground, and that the city commissioners had never approved the street's extension. Webb claimed that Colonel Ludlow had illegally issued orders sending work crews into the cemetery. Superintendent of Roads Beale testified that Colonel Ludlow verbally ordered him to begin work on December 14, that no countermanding order was ever received, and that work began on the cemetery grounds on December 23. The work ceased at the end of that day when Ludlow phoned to tell him to stop. Beale also told the subcommittee that it was not until December 29 that Commissioner Wheatley issued a written order to <b>stop</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 1942, Jim Crawford {{enlisted in}} the Australian Army Medical Corps. Crawford wanted to enlist earlier {{but he had not}} been {{medically}} fit. When Crawford grew tired of peeling spuds he was discharged in September and worked as a stoker in the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, serving aboard mine-sweepers guarding the B.H.P steel works at Whyalla. While working as a stoker, Crawford founded a Worker's study group. Crawford also spoke at War Loan Rallies. At one rally he spoke on a platform with future Australian Prime Minister, Harold Holt, who shouted Crawford to a double whisky after his speech. Jim was charged with mutiny for organising to <b>stop</b> <b>work</b> of naval stokers until they were paid trade union rates. They stood firm and gained the Union rates they were after, however, Crawford was transferred to New Guinea to the Naval Depot HMS Ladava. In 1944, he experienced the bombing by the Japanese in New Guinea. He also served aboard an Icelandic fishing trawler converted to minesweeper HMS Beryl. While working on the minesweeper Crawford had to shovel coal into the furnace. This coal shovelling had caused permanent damage to Crawford's lungs and he developed emphysema. In January, 1945, he was discharged from the navy with a pension as he was suffering from a duodenal ulcer. Once discharged from the navy, he arrived back in Melbourne and wrote for large newspapers, such as the Sporting Globe and the Melbourne Guardian. He worked for the Melbourne Guardian for ten years, writing mostly about political issues.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Physicians with {{recurrent}} {{conditions that}} may affect job performance are sometimes referred for monitoring to help ensure compliance with treatment, ongoing remission of illness, and patient safety. Little is known about recurrence rates among doctors monitored for mood disorders. Our primary objective was to describe recurrence rates among Ontario physicians monitored for recurrent unipolar depression and bipolar disorder (BD). Our secondary objective was to explore predictors of recurrence. Method: We used a retrospective cohort design to describe the time to recurrence, defined as either <b>stopping</b> <b>work</b> due to symptoms or any re-emergence of symptoms meeting a pre-established clinical threshold. Our exploratory analysis of recurrence predictors included age, sex, psychiatric diagnosis, psychiatric comorbidity, medical comorbidity, number of past episodes, past hospitalizations, and family history of psychiatric disorder. Results: During a median observation of 24 months, 36 % (of 50) <b>stopped</b> <b>work</b> due to recurrence and 52 % (of 50) physicians had a re-emergence of clinical symptoms. The median time to <b>stopping</b> <b>work</b> due to recurrence was 11 months and the median time to any level of symptom re-emergence was 13 months. Physicians with psychiatric comorbidity <b>stopped</b> <b>work</b> sooner (hazard ratio [HR] 3. 53; 95 % CI 1. 24 to 10. 03) and had more rapid symptom re-emergence (HR 2. 96; 95 % CI 1. 34 to 6. 52) than those without comorbidity...|$|R
