At last we reached the white winding plain, that had resembled a frozen river, and which from afar had looked so ghastly and stark. We {{found it to be}} a perfectly smooth stratum of salt glistening as if powdered. It was not solid, not stable. At pressure of a boot it shook like jelly. Under the white crust lay a yellow substance that was wet. Here appeared an obstacle we had not calculated upon. Nielsen ventured out on it and his feet sank in several inches. I did not like the wave of the crust. It resembled thin ice under a weight. Presently I ventured to take a few steps, and did not sink in so deeply or make such depression in the crust as Nielsen. We returned to the <b>solid</b> <b>edge</b> and deliberated. Nielsen said that by stepping quickly we could cross without any great risk, though it appeared reasonable that by standing still a person would sink into the substance.|$|E
6000|$|In the {{generalization}} of ornament attempted {{in the first}} volume of the 'Stones of Venice,' I supposed the Norman zigzag (and with some practical truth) to be derived from the angular notches with which the blow of an axe can most easily decorate, or at least vary, the <b>solid</b> <b>edge</b> of a square fillet. My good friend, and supporter, and for some time back the single trustee of St. George's Guild, Mr. George Baker, having come to Oxford on Guild business, I happened to show him the photographs of the front of Iffley church, which had been collected for this lecture; and immediately afterwards, in taking him through the schools, stopped to show him the Athena of Ægina {{as one of the most}} important of the Greek examples lately obtained for us by Professor Richmond. The statue is (rightly) so placed that in looking up to it, the plait of hair across the forehead is seen in a steeply curved arch. [...] "Why," [...] says Mr. Baker, pointing to it, [...] "there's the Norman arch of Iffley." [...] Sure enough, there it exactly was: and a moment's reflection showed me how easily, and with what instinctive fitness, the Norman builders, looking to the Greeks as their absolute masters in sculpture, and recognizing also, during the Crusades, the hieroglyphic use of the zigzag, for water, by the Egyptians, might have adopted this easily attained decoration at once as the sign of the element over which they reigned, and of the power of the Greek goddess who ruled both it and them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ductile {{honeycombs}} under in-plane biaxial loads fail by elastic buckling, plastic yielding {{and fast}} fracture of <b>solid</b> cell <b>edges,</b> while brittle honeycombs fail by elastic buckling, brittle rupturing and fast fracture of <b>solid</b> cell <b>edges.</b> In the paper, {{we aim at}} summarizing the modeling and theoretical expressions for describing the failure surfaces of honeycombs with non-uniform thickness cell edges under in-plane biaxial loads. Hence, the failure surfaces of ductile honeycombs with plateau borders are generated and found {{to be dependent on}} the solid distribution in cell edges and the yielding strengths of <b>solid</b> cell <b>edges.</b> Also, the failure surfaces of brittle honeycombs with plateau borders are significantly affected by the cell-edge modulus of rupture and the solid distribution in cell edges...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel graph-theoretic approach, named ratio contour, to extract perceptually salient boundaries from {{a set of}} noisy boundary fragments detected in real images. The boundary saliency is defined using the Gestalt laws of closure, proximity, and continuity. This paper first constructs an undirected graph with two different set of edges: <b>solid</b> <b>edges</b> and dashed edges. The weights of <b>solid</b> and dashed <b>edges</b> measure the local saliency in and between boundary fragments, respectively. Then the most salient boundary is detected by searching for an optimal cycle in this graph with minimum average weight. The proposed approach guarantees the global optimality without introducing any biases related to region area or boundary length. We collect a variety of images for testing the proposed approach with encouraging results. ...|$|R

Yet there is little information available concerning the withdrawal strength of various fasteners, and, in particular, dowels in composite materials <b>edged</b> <b>solid</b> wood <b>edge</b> bandings. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the withdrawal strengths of 6, 8, 10 mm diameter dowels produced from beech with respect to edge of a medium-density fiberboard (MDF) or particleboard (PB) edged with 5, 10 and 15 mm thickness of <b>solid</b> wood <b>edge</b> banding of uludag fir, bonded with different adhesives. According to TS 4539 standard, the effects of edge banding thickness, dimension of dowels, type of composite {{materials and}} type of adhesives used for edge banding on the withdrawal strength were determined. The highest (6. 37 N/mm²) withdrawal strength was obtained in beech dowels with 8 mm diameter for MDF with 5 mm thickness of <b>solid</b> wood <b>edge</b> banding of uludag fir bonded with D-VTKA adhesive. According to results, if the hole wall and the surface of dowel are smooth then the adhesives give better mechanical adhesion with dowels and composite materials...|$|R

Propagation characteristics of standing acoustic waves at the boundary between two <b>solid</b> <b>edges</b> within a closed resonance tube are a function of displacement. The possibility of designing a waveguide acoustic transducer for linear displacement measurement was investigated. Signal conditioning and processing is carried out using LabVIEW VIs.

40|$|Entity {{reconstruction}} is a {{very important}} problem in history-based and feature-based solid modeling system, recognizing and identifying the topological entities is a critical point in this problem. In this paper a new approach for recognizing and identifying the topological elements is presented in detailed, based on which a data structure called Topological Relation Graph (TRG) is introduced too. TRG memorizes the solid reconstruction process of a part and tracks the topological relation of elements between original and current solid model. Using TRG, solid modeling system can reconstruct correctly according to the original designer's design intent. Algorithms for identifying the <b>solid</b> faces, <b>edges</b> and vertexes are also given in this paper. The main characteristic of the proposed approach is that it can track the modeling history correctly, represent the designer's design ideas for the original solid model, and can also identify the solid element including <b>solid</b> face, <b>edge</b> and vertex. © 2014 WIT Press...|$|R

50|$|As well, {{the ongoing}} {{technical}} development and long production {{history of the}} F-86 resulted in some {{significant differences in the}} handling and flying characteristics between the various F-86 models. Some of the important changes to the design included the switch from an elevator/stabilizer to an all-flying tail, the discontinuation of leading edge slats for a <b>solid</b> leading <b>edge</b> with increased internal fuel capacity, increased engine power and internal missile bay (F-86D). Each of these design changes impacted the handling and flying characteristics of the F-86 and not necessarily for the better. In the case of the <b>solid</b> leading <b>edge</b> and increased internal fuel capacity, the design change produced increased combat performance but exacerbated a dangerous and often fatal handling characteristic upon takeoff if the nose was raised prematurely from the runway. This 'over-rotation' danger is now a major area of instruction and concern for current F-86 pilots. The 1972 Sacramento Canadair Sabre accident resulting in 22 fatalities and 28 other casualties was a result of over-rotation on takeoff.|$|R
