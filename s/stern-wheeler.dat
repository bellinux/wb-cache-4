5|$|On Victoria Day, 24 May 1881, the <b>stern-wheeler</b> ferry SS Victoria capsized in the Thames River {{close to}} Cove Bridge in West London. Approximately 200 {{passengers}} {{drowned in the}} shallow river, {{making it one of}} the worst disasters in London's history, and is now dubbed 'The Victoria Day Disaster'. At the time, London's population was relativity low, therefore it was hard to find a person in the city who did not have a family member affected by the tragedy.|$|E
25|$|In March 1892 {{there were}} rumors of an {{impending}} rate war on the Portland-Astoria run among the Union Pacific, owners of the Harvest Queen, the then-new and speedy steamer T.J. Potter, and the pioneer steamboat men Jacob Kamm, owner of Lurline, and U.B. Scott, owner of the very fast <b>stern-wheeler</b> Telephone.|$|E
2500|$|The trial {{trip was}} {{reported}} to have been successful. [...] At this time the steamer was already being as “said to be the fastest <b>stern-wheeler</b> afloat.” ...|$|E
50|$|The company built <b>stern-wheelers,</b> coasters, barges, ferries, lightships, launches, tugs, and yachts.|$|R
50|$|The <b>stern-wheeler's</b> true end is unknown. She was beached and {{stripped}} {{on one of}} the Gulf Islands.|$|R

2500|$|After that, she was {{transferred}} to Puget Sound to compete with another famous steamboat, the Bailey Gatzert, which was owned by the Seattle Steam Navigation and Transportation Company. [...] The Bailey was a <b>stern-wheeler,</b> and did better in the Sound than the sidewheeler Potter, which rolled {{from side to side}} in swells, raising first one paddle wheel then the other out of the water.|$|E
2500|$|The T.J. Potter was a {{steamboat}} that {{operated in}} the Northwestern United States. [...] The boat {{was launched in}} 1888. [...] Her upper cabins came from the steamboat Wide West. [...] This required some modification, because the T.J. Potter was a side-wheeler, whereas the Wide West had been a <b>stern-wheeler.</b> [...] The boat's first owner was the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. The T. J. Potter {{was one of the}} few side-wheeler boats that operated on the Columbia River.|$|E
2500|$|On Wednesday, October 25, 1911, No Wonder went aground on {{the middle}} Columbia river at Prindle’s Landing, near Cape Horn, where the steamer had stopped {{to pick up a}} log tow. [...] The Shaver <b>stern-wheeler</b> [...] Wauna was {{initially}} sent to the scene to assist No Wonder, and later, on Saturday, October 28, Capt. “Dell” Shaver went himself with Sarah Dixon to assist Wauna. [...] The wind was blowing hard from the east, which seemed to be pushing the water away from the area where No Wonder was stranded, making it harder to refloat the vessel. [...] A report was that the east wind was blowing so hard that it was almost impossible to stand on the forward deck of Wauna approaching Cape Horn.|$|E

50|$|Proponents of <b>stern-wheelers,</b> {{these two}} Americans built the Settler 1861, Lady Daly 1862 and Lady Darling 1864 from {{selected}} Oregon pine. and ran an extensive shipping agency {{operating on the}} Murray, {{the east coast of}} Australia and to New Zealand. They later also owned Corowa, Culgoa and Francis Cadell. A. L. Blake was a close associate. Their partnership was dissolved in 1869.|$|R
6000|$|The Korosko, a turtle-bottomed, round-bowed <b>stern-wheeler,</b> with a 30-inch draught and {{the lines}} of a flat-iron, started upon the 13th of February in the year 1895, from Shellal, {{at the head of the}} first cataract, bound for Wady Halfa. I have a {{passenger}} card for the trip, which I here reproduce: ...|$|E
60|$|The bluff bows of the <b>stern-wheeler</b> had squelched {{into the}} soft brown mud, and the current had swept the boat {{alongside}} the bank. The long gangway was thrown across, and the six tall soldiers of the Soudanese escort filed along it, their light-blue, gold-trimmed zouave uniforms and their jaunty yellow and red forage caps showing up bravely in the clear morning light.|$|E
60|$|Up in {{this region}} we met massed acres of lumber rafts coming down--but not {{floating}} leisurely along, in the old-fashioned way, manned with joyous and reckless crews of fiddling, song-singing, whiskey-drinking, breakdown-dancing rapscallions; no, {{the whole thing was}} shoved swiftly along by a powerful <b>stern-wheeler,</b> modern fashion, and the small crews were quiet, orderly men, of a sedate business aspect, with not a suggestion of romance about them anywhere.|$|E
5000|$|Although Speke began {{operating}} in 1910, delays in laying railway track delayed {{completion of the}} Busoga Railway until 1913. [...] The Uganda Railway later augmented the service by adding the <b>stern-wheelers</b> [...] in 1913 and [...] in 1925. All three Lake Kyoga vessels resembled typical Mississippi steamboats of the era. After Stanley entered service, Speke and her barges were used mainly to carry cotton for export from nearby plantations.|$|R
5000|$|Calhoun {{authorized}} Long {{to design}} and build a special steamboat for the expedition. [...] The vessel, the Western Engineer, was constructed in Pittsburgh in 1818-19. One of the first <b>stern-wheelers</b> ever built, it was 75 ft long, with a beam of 13 ft, and a draft of only 19 in. To impress the indigenous peoples who beheld it, it bore [...] "an elegant flag representing a white man and an Indian shaking hands, the calumet of peace and the sword", and the bow was formed {{in the shape of}} [...] "a huge serpent, black and scaly ... his mouth open, vomiting smoke".|$|R
50|$|Steamboats, {{including}} side-wheelers and <b>stern-wheelers,</b> sometimes encountered tragedies on Dorcheat Bayou. An early steamer {{caught fire}} as it returned south; a woman leaped from the vessel {{with a child}} under each arm. She but {{only one of the}} children were rescued. In 1850, the Shamrock also burned with the loss of one person. The ships carried cargo and passengers and often offered mostly musical entertainment. Among these ships were the Danube, the Jewel, and the Marie Louise, a reference to the second wife of Napoleon I. The steamboat era on Dorcheat ended in 1892, with the enhanced access to railroads, one of which was the Sibley, Lake Bistineau, and Southern Railway. Passenger rail service along Dorcheat Bayou ended in 1969.|$|R
60|$|WE had {{powerful}} good luck; {{because we}} got a chance in a <b>stern-wheeler</b> from away North which was bound {{for one of them}} bayous or one-horse rivers away down Louisiana way, and so we could go {{all the way down the}} Upper Mississippi and all the way down the Lower Mississippi to that farm in Arkansaw without having to change steamboats at St. Louis; not so very much short of a thousand miles at one pull.|$|E
60|$|But all {{bad things}} {{come to an}} end as well as good, and so with Black Leclere. On the summer low water, in a poling boat, he left McDougall for Sunrise. He left McDougall in company with Timothy Brown, and arrived at Sunrise by himself. Further, it was known that they had quarrelled just {{previous}} to pulling out; for the Lizzie, a wheezy ten- ton <b>stern-wheeler,</b> twenty-four hours behind, beat Leclere in by three days. And when he did get in, it was with a clean-drilled bullet-hole through his shoulder muscle, and a tale of ambush and murder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{about three}} in the morning I fetched Elexandria and see this <b>stern-wheeler</b> laying there, and was very glad, because I felt {{perfectly}} safe, now, you know. It was just daybreak. I went aboard and got this stateroom and put on these clothes and went up in the pilot-house--to watch, though I didn't reckon there was any need of it. I set there and played with my di'monds and waited and waited for the boat to start, but she didn't. You see, they was mending her machinery, but I didn't know anything about it, not being very much used to steamboats.|$|E
60|$|Threshing {{up against}} the current, the gunboats and <b>stern-wheelers</b> one after another entered the gorge. The Nile, which below is nearly a mile across, narrows to a bare 200 yards. The pace of the stream becomes more swift. Great swirls and eddies disturb its surface. High on either side rise black, broken, and precipitous cliffs, looking like piles of {{gigantic}} stones. Through and among them the flood-river pours with a loud roaring, breaking into foam and rapids wherever the submerged rocks are near the surface. Between the barren heights and the water is a strip of green bushes and grass. The bright verdant colour seems the more brilliant by contrast with the muddy water and the sombre rocks. It is a forbidding passage. A few hundred riflemen scattered Afridiwise among {{the tops of the}} hills, a few field-guns in the mud forts by the bank, and the door would be shut.|$|R
500|$|From a {{total of}} 11 squadrons and 3,000 men [...] rose in one century to 20 squadrons totalling 52,000 men, with its main base near Shanghai. The regular {{striking}} force could be supported at need by substantial merchantmen; thus in the campaign of 1161 some 340 ships of this kind participated in the battles on the Yangtze. The age was one of continual innovation; in 1129 trebuchets throwing gunpowder bombs were decreed standard equipment on all warships, between 1132 and 1183 {{a great number of}} treadmill-operated paddle-wheel craft, large and small, were built, including <b>stern-wheelers</b> and ships with as many as 11 paddle-wheels a side (the invention of the remarkable engineer Kao Hsuan), and in 1203 some of these were armored with iron plates (to the design of another outstanding shipwright Chhin Shih-Fu)...In sum, the navy of the Southern Sung held off the [...] and then the Mongols for nearly two centuries, gaining complete control of the East China Sea.|$|R
60|$|The bluff bows of the <b>stern-wheeler</b> had squelched {{into the}} soft brown mud, and the current had swept the boat {{alongside}} the bank. The long gangway was thrown across, and the six tall soldiers of the Soudanese escort filed along it, their light-blue gold-trimmed zouave uniforms, and their jaunty yellow and red forage-caps, showing up bravely in the clear morning light. Above them, {{on the top of}} the bank, was ranged the line of donkeys, and the air was full of the clamour of the boys. In shrill strident voices each was crying out the virtues of his own beast, and abusing that of his neighbour.|$|E
60|$|There {{was great}} {{excitement}} {{on the first}} Sunday following our going into camp, when the whistle of a steamer announced {{the coming of the}} mail. It produced as much movement as an election or a bear fight. We all ran to the bank to see her struggle with the current, gaining headway only inch by inch. She was a small <b>stern-wheeler,</b> not unlike the boats which run on the upper Missouri. We all followed her down to the Hudson Bay post, like a lot of small boys at a circus, to see her unload. This was excitement enough for one day, and we returned to camp feeling that we were once more in touch with civilization.|$|E
6000|$|The old men who {{sat with}} me and valorously slew {{mosquitoes}} were Lone Chief and Mutsak, erstwhile comrades in arms, and now withered repositories of tradition and ancient happening. They were the last of their generation and without honor among the younger set which had grown up on the farthest fringe of a mining civilization. Who cared for tradition in these days, when spirits could be evoked from black bottles, and black bottles could be evoked from the complaisant white men for a few hours' sweat or a mangy fur? Of what potency the fearful rites and masked mysteries of shamanism, when daily that living wonder, the steamboat, coughed and spluttered {{up and down the}} Yukon in defiance of all law, a veritable fire-breathing monster? And of what value was hereditary prestige, when he who now chopped the most wood, or best conned a <b>stern-wheeler</b> through the island mazes, attained the chiefest consideration of his fellows? ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{next step}} was to ascend the [...] "Olo' Mpongwe," [...] or Gaboon River, which Bowdich ("Sketch of Gaboon") calls Oroöngo, and its main point Ohlombopolo. The object was to visit the Fán, of whose {{cannibalism}} such curious tales had been told. It was not easy to find a conveyance. The factory greatly wanted a flat-bottom iron steamer, a <b>stern-wheeler,</b> with sliding keel, and furnaces fit for burning half-dried wood--a craft of fourteen tons, costing perhaps £14 per ton, would be ample in point of size, and would save not a little money to the trader. I was at last fortunate in securing the [...] "Eliza," [...] belonging to Messrs. Hatton and Cookson. She was a fore-and-aft schooner of twenty tons, measuring 42 feet 6 inches over all and put up at Bonny Town by Captain Birkett. She had two masts, and oars in case of calms; her crew was of six hands, including one Fernando, a Congoese, who could actually box the compass. No outfit was this time necessary, beyond a letter to Mr. Tippet, who had charge of the highest establishments up stream. His business consisted chiefly of importing arms, ammunition, and beads of different sorts, especially the red porcelain, locally called Loangos.|$|E
60|$|The frieze now {{was more}} {{grotesque}} than ever, but had changed suddenly to an equestrian one, sharply outlined against the deep-blue Egyptian sky. Those {{who have never}} ridden before have to ride in Egypt, and when the donkeys break into a canter, and the Nile Irregulars are at full charge, such a scene of flying veils, clutching hands, huddled swaying figures, and anxious faces {{is nowhere to be}} seen. Belmont, his square figure balanced upon a small white donkey, was waving his hat to his wife, who had come out upon the saloon-deck of the Korosko. Cochrane sat very erect with a stiff military seat, hands low, head high, and heels down, while beside him rode the young Oxford man, looking about him with drooping eyelids as if he thought the desert hardly respectable, and had his doubts about the Universe. Behind them the whole party was strung along the bank in varying stages of jolting and discomfort, a brown-faced, noisy donkey-boy running after each donkey. Looking back, they could see the little lead-coloured <b>stern-wheeler,</b> with the gleam of Mrs. Belmont's handkerchief from the deck. Beyond ran the broad, brown river, winding down in long curves to where, five miles off, the square, white block-houses upon the black, ragged hills marked the outskirts of Wady Haifa, which had been their starting-point that morning.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was never}} food enough to winter the whole population. The A. C. Company {{worked hard to}} freight up the grub, but the gold hunters came faster and dared more audaciously. When the A. C. Company added a new <b>stern-wheeler</b> to its fleet, men said, [...] "Now we shall have plenty." [...] But more gold hunters poured in over the passes to the south, more voyageurs and fur traders forced a way through the Rockies from the east, more seal hunters and coast adventurers poled up from Bering Sea on the west, more sailors deserted from the whale-ships to the north, and they all starved {{together}} in right brotherly fashion. More steamers were added, but the tide of prospectors welled always in advance. Then the N. A. T. & T. Company came upon the scene, and both companies added steadily to their fleets. But {{it was the same}} old story; famine would not depart. In fact, famine grew with the population, till, in the winter of 1897-1898, the United States government was forced to equip a reindeer relief expedition. As of old, that winter partners cut the cards and drew straws, and remained or pulled for salt water as chance decided. They were wise of old time, and had learned never to figure on relief expeditions. They had heard of such things, but no mortal man of them had ever laid eyes on one.|$|E
6000|$|While {{the pilot}} {{went on with}} his talk, and in regular, rhythmical motion [...] Swayed {{from one side to}} the other before his wheel, and we listened, [...] Certain typical facts of the picturesque life of the river [...] Won their way to our {{consciousness}} as without help of our senses. [...] It was along about the beginning of March, but already [...] In the sleepy sunshine the budding maples and willows, [...] Where they waded out in the shallow wash of the freshet, [...] Showed the dull red and the yellow green of their blossoms and catkins, [...] And in their tops the foremost flocks of blackbirds debated [...] As to which they should colonize first. The indolent house-boats [...] Loafing along the shore, sent up in silvery spirals [...] Out of their kitchen pipes the smoke of their casual breakfasts. [...] Once a wide tow of coal-barges, loaded clear down to the gunwales, [...] Gave us the slack of the current, with proper formalities shouted [...] By the hoarse-throated <b>stern-wheeler</b> that pushed the black barges [...] before her, [...] And as she passed us poured a foamy cascade from her paddles. [...] Then, as a raft of logs, which the spread of the barges had hidden, [...] River-wide, weltered in sight, with a sudden jump forward the pilot [...] Dropped his whole weight on the spokes of the wheel just in time to [...] escape it.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few years}} the {{magnificent}} fleets of the river began to feel the fatal rivalry of the trains that swept along its borders. Travel deserted them, and traffic sought the surer and swifter transportation of the shore. The great packets that had carried swarms of passengers to and from Pittsburg and Cincinnati and all the points between, disappeared or were converted into freight-boats, and then these began to fail for want of traffic, and the Beautiful River was almost abandoned to the <b>stern-wheeler</b> pushing a flotilla of coal-barges. A like change took place upon the lake; steamers which formed the means of communication between the towns and cities from Cleveland to Buffalo, and from Cleveland to Detroit, ceased to touch at the smaller ports, and became the pleasure-craft of the summer tourists, or the carriers of heavy freight, and the ports which did not become the feeders of the railroads dwindled to insignificance. But the railroads could not affect the navigation of the lake quite so disastrously {{as that of the}} river; the lake in such a rivalry had some such advantage as that of the sea from its mere vastness, and from the expanses where the railroads could not follow the steamer in the mere nature of things. The iron horse had his way with the canals, though, and these monuments of a former period of enterprise grow more and more like its sepulcher, where he drank them dry. or where he left their slow currents to stagnate unstirred by the keels of the leisurely craft once so jubilantly welcomed to them.|$|E
