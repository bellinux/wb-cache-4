Two of its battalions captured Phou Khe and Phonsavan on 12 September; the third relieved GM 22 at Khang Khay. GM 22 advanced one kilometer northwest to occupy a cavern containing a Pathet Lao radio station, and other materiel.|$|E

25|$|The war {{wiped out}} {{many of the}} gains which Japan had made since 1868. About 40% of the nation's {{industrial}} plants and infrastructure were destroyed, and production reverted to levels of about fifteen years earlier. The people were shocked by the devastation and <b>swung</b> <b>into</b> action. New factories were equipped with the best modern machines, giving Japan an initial competitive advantage over the victor states, who now had older factories. As Japan's second period of economic development began, millions of former soldiers joined a well-disciplined and highly educated work force to rebuild Japan. Japan's colonies were lost {{as a result of}} World War II, but since then the Japanese had extended their economic influence throughout Asia and beyond.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} the rocket had also {{dislodged}} two of the 1000-lb AN-M65 bombs, which fell to the deck, and lay in the pool of burning fuel between White's aircraft and that of Lieutenant Commander John McCain. Damage Control Team No. 8 <b>swung</b> <b>into</b> action immediately, and Chief Gerald Farrier, recognizing the risk, and {{without the benefit of}} protective clothing, immediately smothered the bombs with a PKP fire extinguisher in an effort to delay the fuel fire spreading for long enough to allow the pilots to escape. The pilots, still strapped into their aircraft, were immediately aware that a disaster was unfolding, but only some were able to escape in time. McCain, pilot of A-4 Skyhawk side No. 416, next to White's, {{was among the first to}} notice the flames, and escaped by scrambling down the nose of his A-4 and jumping off the refueling probe shortly before the explosions began.|$|E
25|$|The SG 550 has a side-folding {{skeletonized}} buttstock (folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver) and a lightweight aluminium bipod that folds into grooves in the lower handguard. The hinged stock is firmly locked in the folded position by a socket in the butt which clips into a plastic stud on the handguard; a firm pull will release the stock which is then <b>swung</b> <b>into</b> the closed position and locked by a button catch. A collapsible side-folding stock is also available. The stock, pistol grip, and handguards are made of a high-strength polymer, and are produced in either green or black colour options. The steel receiver housing and several other components are manufactured using stamping and welding; external steel surfaces are finished with a ceramic-reinforced enamel coat known as Ilaflon. The gas system's components are made of stainless steel. The barrel, bolt, bolt carrier, and firing pin are all made with steel that has been gas nitrided, hardened and tempered. The bolt and carrier, along with most other components internal to the receiver undergo a phosphating process.|$|E

25|$|The Mle 1915 was a {{conventional}} design with a hydro-pneumatic recoil system mounted under the barrel, a gun shield {{to protect the}} crew and a box carriage with wooden wheels. It used an interrupted-screw breech with separate-loading ammunition; the shell being loaded first followed by the proper amount of propellant in a brass cartridge case. A loading tray was hinged {{to the left side}} of the cradle. It was <b>swung</b> <b>into</b> position after the breech had opened to hold the shell before it was pushed into the chamber, which had a catch to hold the shell in place until it could be rammed, but had to be moved out of the way before the breech could be closed for firing. It could be towed by a team of eight horses if a two-wheeled limber was placed under the trail and the barrel pulled back along the trail to move the center of gravity towards the limber. For (slow) motor-traction no limber was necessary and the trail was hooked directly to the tractor.|$|E
25|$|After a brief clash on the Confederate {{right flank}} between Fitzhugh Lee and the {{advancing}} brigade of Brig. Gen. George A. Custer, Custer led his brigade {{on a road}} southwest to Trevilian Station. He found the station totally unguarded, occupied only by Hampton's trains—supply wagons, caissons containing ammunition and food, and hundreds of horses. The 5th Michigan Cavalry captured the lot, but left Custer cut off from Sheridan, and {{in their pursuit of}} the fleeing wagons, lost a number of their own men and much of their bounty. One of Wright's regiments, the 7th Georgia, got between Custer's force and Trevilian Station. Custer ordered the 7th Michigan to charge, driving the Georgians back. Hampton now learned of the threat in his rear area and sent in three brigades. Suddenly Custer was virtually surrounded, his command in an ever-shrinking circle, as every side was charged and hit with shells. Sheridan heard the firing from Custer's direction and realized he needed help. He charged with two brigades, pushing Hampton's men back {{all the way to the}} station, while a third brigade <b>swung</b> <b>into</b> Fitzhugh Lee's exposed right flank, thus pushing him back. Hampton fell back to the west, Lee to the east, and the battle ended for the day with the Federals in possession of Trevilian Station.|$|E
500|$|The British Empire {{declared}} war on Germany on 5 August, and the RAN <b>swung</b> <b>into</b> action. Australia had departed Sydney the night before, and was heading north to rendezvous with other RAN vessels south of German New Guinea. The German colonial capital of Rabaul was considered a likely base of operations for von Spee, and Patey put together a plan to clear the harbour. Australias role was to hang back: if the armoured cruisers [...] and [...] were present, the other RAN vessels would lure them into range of the battlecruiser. The night-time operation was executed on 11 August, and no German ships {{were found in the}} harbour. Over the next two days, Australia and the other ships unsuccessfully searched the nearby bays and coastline for the German ships and any wireless stations, before returning to Port Moresby to refuel.|$|E

500|$|To {{address the}} problem, and redress the balance for bowlers, the MCC made some {{alterations}} to the laws. The {{size of the}} ball was reduced in 1927, {{and that of the}} stumps increased in 1931, but the changes had little effect. Between 1929 and 1933, county authorities conducted a trial in which a batsman could be lbw if he had hit the ball onto his pads. Then, in 1935, an experimental law was introduced in which the batsman could be dismissed lbw even if the ball pitched outside the line of off stump—in other words, a ball that turned or <b>swung</b> <b>into</b> the batsman but did not pitch in line with the wickets. However, the ball was still required to strike the batsman in line with the wickets. The umpire signalled to the scorers when he declared a batsman out under the new rule, and any such dismissal was designated [...] "lbw (n)" [...] on the scorecard.|$|E
500|$|The Endurance left England on 8 August 1914 {{destined for}} Buenos Aires, where Shackleton, {{travelling}} separately, {{would join the}} expedition. [...] The departure of the expedition was troubled; the impending outbreak of the First World War prompted some members including Worsley, anticipating a call up to the RNR, to propose a postponement of the voyage. However, the Admiralty advised Shackleton to proceed with his plans even after Britain declared war on Imperial Germany on 4 August. Just prior to {{the departure of the}} Endurance Worsley approached the authorities and was advised that RNR personnel were not being called up at the time. While steaming to South America, fuel ran low and wood intended for planned buildings at the expedition's base in Antarctica was used to keep the engine running. Worsley ran a relatively relaxed ship with little discipline or control of alcohol consumption. Four crew members got into a barroom brawl at a stopover in Madeira, a neutral port. While anchored in the harbour, a neighbouring German ship <b>swung</b> <b>into</b> the Endurance, damaging it. Worsley, enraged, boarded the German ship with some other members of the expedition and forced the crew to repair the damage caused.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{criticism}} of the Tamil Nadu government's mishandling of the crisis, many notable personalities and other people helped those affected by floods. In Chennai, people across the city offered aid, shelter and food through social media channels like Twitter, Whatsapp, and Facebook. Social media sites were also used extensively to relay information about flooded areas, rescue agencies and food and relief centers. Chennai residents set up a temporary website to crowd source information about people needing help and about those who were ready to help. Celebrities such as RJ Balaji, actor Siddharth and Chinmayi actively participated in the relief process by using social media to coordinate aid and gather information. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh members distributed food and relief materials in various rain-hit areas of Chennai, districts of Cuddalore and Kancheepuram. RSS workers <b>swung</b> <b>into</b> action immediately, involved in rescuing operations wading through neck-deep water. Swayamsevaks cleared street lamp post, cleared traffic, distributed food and relief materials. Around 5500 RSS-Sevabharati volunteers served the affected areas. [...] Food was distributed to 21 lakh people in 118 relief centres; family kit was distributed with 20 essential items to 63000 families. [...] Around 133 medical camps were conducted with 160 Doctors benefitting 23000 people. Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu visited and distributed relief materials to the flood victims at Tambaram.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{relative}} {{peace of the}} early years of Selvo's reign, the forces that would eventually lead to his deposition had already <b>swung</b> <b>into</b> action. In southern Italy, the Duke of Apulia and Calabria, Robert Guiscard, had spent the majority of his reign consolidating Norman power along the heel and toe of lo Stivale by expelling the Byzantine armies. [...] Guiscard was pushing north toward the Papal States (to which the Duchy of Apulia and Calabria was allied), and was threatening Byzantine control of cities along the Ionian and Adriatic seas. In May 1081, Guiscard led his army and navy across the sea to lay siege to the port city of Durazzo, as it was one end of the famous Via Egnatia, a direct route to the Byzantine capital of Constantinople. Alexios I Komnenos, the newly crowned Byzantine Emperor, dispatched an urgent message to Selvo asking for the mobilization of the Venetian fleet in defense of Durazzo in return for great rewards. The Doge wasted no time in setting sail for the besieged city in charge of his fleet of 14 warships and 45 other vessels. Selvo was motivated not only by his familial ties and the promise of reward, but also the realization that Norman control over the Strait of Otranto would be just as great of a threat to Venetian power in the region as it would be to their ally in the east.|$|E
500|$|Standing 188cm, Johnston had {{a smooth}} ten-pace {{approach}} to the wicket, with an idiosyncratic dip of his head before the instant of delivery. He had success on moist English pitches, with deliveries from over the wicket because of the increased chances of leg before wicket decisions and to induce edges from balls angling across the batsmen. His stock ball <b>swung</b> <b>into</b> the right-hander, but he mixed this with an away swinger. The late swing in flight which generated the batsman's uncertainty over {{the direction in which}} the ball would move was responsible for the majority of Johnston's wickets in England. Although his pace was lower than that generated by Lindwall or Miller, he was noted for his accuracy and ability to revert to spin bowling on sticky wickets. Nevertheless, his casual run-up belied a deceptive pace. He possessed strong hands, attributed to his milking of the family's cattle herd. Johnston was an economical bowler, conceding only 2.07 runs per over. He was known for his elbow movement and flailing arms during his delivery action, with one commentator noting [...] "one of these days an umpire will get a poke in the eye". Johnston also had a reputation of visibly enjoying himself on field, putting his hand on his hips and grinning, regardless of the result of his delivery. According to teammate Alan Walker, Johnston bowled at least as many bouncers as his colleagues, but because of his happy nature, observers thought that he eschewed the short ball.|$|E

I attacked her with proportional dividers, planimeter, rotameter, Simpson's rule, Froude's coefficients, Dixon Kemp's formulae, series, curves, differentials, and all the appliances of modern yacht designing, and she emerged from the ordeal a theoretically perfect boat. For when she is underway every element of resistance, stability, weight, heeling effort, and propulsive force is in one transverse plane, and that plane is the boat's midship section. I know of no similar case in the whole field of naval architecture, ancient or modern.” ...|$|E

Again, the corporation insisted that the mishap was a result of nature's fury. After the accident, questions were raised about the safety and credibility of the Konkan Railway. An enquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety revealed the cause of the accident to be due to [...] "falling of boulders and earth" [...] on the tracks. After the report, the corporation <b>swung</b> <b>into</b> action, implementing all its recommendations, including limiting the speed of trains during the monsoon to [...] as opposed to the regular speed limit of , as well as undertaking several geo-technical engineering works, including boulder netting, shotcreting, rock bolting, micropiling and vetiver plantations along the line to increase safety.|$|E
