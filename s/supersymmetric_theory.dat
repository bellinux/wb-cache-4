5|$|General {{relativity}} {{does not}} place any {{limits on the}} possible dimensions of spacetime. Although the theory is typically formulated in four dimensions, one can write down the same equations for the gravitational field {{in any number of}} dimensions. Supergravity is more restrictive because it places an upper limit on the number of dimensions. In 1978, work by Werner Nahm showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent <b>supersymmetric</b> <b>theory</b> is eleven. In the same year, Eugene Cremmer, Bernard Julia, and Joel Scherk of the École Normale Supérieure showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reason for}} having two scalar Higgs {{doublets}} {{rather than one}} is {{in order to have}} Yukawa couplings between the Higgs and both down-type quarks and up-type quarks; these are the terms responsible for the quarks' masses. In the Standard Model the down-type quarks couple to the Higgs field (which has Y=-1/2) and the up-type quarks to its complex conjugate (which has Y=+1/2). However, in a <b>supersymmetric</b> <b>theory</b> this is not allowed, so two types of Higgs fields are needed.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} to have supersymmetry in dimensions other than four. Because the properties of spinors change drastically between different dimensions, each dimension has its characteristic. In d dimensions, the size of spinors is approximately 2d/2 or 2(d − 1)/2. Since {{the maximum number of}} supersymmetries is 32, the greatest number of dimensions in which a <b>supersymmetric</b> <b>theory</b> can exist is eleven.|$|E
