40|$|This master thesis {{describes}} the design, calculation, simulation {{and construction of}} a buoy shape called the <b>Salter</b> <b>Duck</b> with an internal direct electrical wave energy conversion system. The internal system consists of two dual rotating weight systems connected to one radial permanent magnet generator each. Section 1 gives an introduction and {{describes the}} general design of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) and the master thesis problem to be looked at. Section 2 is a recap of the history, principle behavior and basic calculation of the <b>Salter</b> <b>Duck</b> Wave Energy Converter (WEC), and choosing of a design wave. Section 3 goes on to describe the scaling of a buoy model to be constructed. Section 3. 1 and 3. 2 describes choosing of the design wave, the buoy model scaling and calculation. Section 3. 3 describes {{the theory of the}} rotating weight system and calculation of a model of this to fit into the buoy calculated in section 3. 1 and 3. 2. A simulation of the rotating weight system is done in a mechanical simulation program called Newton in section 3. 4. The calculation and simulation of the model generator is done in section 4, and also refers to the appendix A for design equations and calculations. An Excel calculation model was made to calculate the generator and the generated values at harmonic rotation and in latching mode, which is described in section 4. 3 and 4. 4. The construction of the test model was to be described in section 5, but it now explains why it was not done and refers to the construction drawings appended in appendix B. Ways of increasing efficiency of the system is looked at in section 6. All data files from Excel, Newton, COMSOL and others are in the appended zip-file for this project. There were more files than appended here, approx. 1 Gb total, but it has been cut down so that the zip-file is one fifth of this due to space requirements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{design of}} a Radial Flux Permanent Magnet (RFPM) ring generator for an ocean Wave Energy Converter (WEC). It has a large diameter 61. 4 cm and low speed 37. 5 rpm. Three phase one layer concentrated winding design is investigated. The design was carried out {{with the help of}} SmartCAD machine design and Comsol software. Contribution is done to add an optimization loop to the machine design software. Monte-Carlo method is used to optimize the design with the objective of high efficiency and low cost. Cost optimization includes cost of material, cost of production and cost of losses or efficiency. Production cost is added to the SmartCAD design tool as a separate subroutine. Three groups of slot and pole combinations are considered. The slot and pole combinations with Np = Ns &# 177; 2 k where k= 1, 2 are further narrowed down to Np = Ns + 2, with higher fundamental winding factor and lower cogging torque amplitude. The optimal design has 72 slots and 74 poles with 86. 7 % efficiency. Cost of material and production is estimated of 3085 NOK. With assumption of 4000 hours operational time per year and life time of ten years, the cost per kWh for the WEC is estimated. Based on the SmartMotor experience, cost of the mechanical and electrical parts will be roughly as 1 NOK/kWh per year. This is comparable to the cost of <b>Salter</b> <b>duck</b> and higher than IPS OWEC. The further investment and improvement is worthy. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is then used to confirm optimality of the design. The parameters are measured in Comsol and then compared with the Matlab result. The entire machine is simulated as rotor moving across one pole pair. </p...|$|E
50|$|However, {{because of}} the 1980s oil glut, the {{perceived}} need for immediate alternative energy sources declined and, in 1982, the Wave Energy program was disbanded. This ended the hope of having <b>Salter's</b> <b>duck</b> become a mainstay in the alternative energy campaign. After later investigation, {{it was discovered that}} the Energy Technology Support Unit's cost determinations had mis-estimated the cost of building <b>Salter's</b> <b>duck</b> by more than double the actual cost. The Energy Technology Support Unit was set up in 1974 as an agency on behalf of the Department of Energy; though its function was to manage research programmes on renewable energy and energy conservation, it was operated by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. Cost considerations based on the findings were among the main factors in the duck's not being put into widespread production under the Wave Energy program in the late 1970s. The other major factor was that a consulting firm tasked with distributing government grants passed over the 9.5 million pounds that had been allocated to Salter's research and the improvement of <b>Salter's</b> <b>duck,</b> so the funds were never actually granted to Salter and his group. From this revelation and with the increase in research into alternative energy in the 2000s, <b>Salter's</b> <b>duck</b> has begun {{to be used as a}} part of wave energy research in the United Kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the efficiency of energy output from <b>Salter's</b> <b>duck,</b> in 1975, scientist Swift-Hook and others ran a series of tests. The optimum range of the ducks was determined according to the formula, ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, Salter set about {{creating}} a source of alternative energy. The idea for creating <b>Salter's</b> <b>duck</b> came about from his studies on a lavatory cistern while at Edinburgh University. He invented <b>Salter's</b> <b>duck</b> in 1974 and attempted to make it the main device of choice for the Wave Energy program in the United Kingdom. A prototype attempt to use the device was constructed in 1976 off Dores Beach. It was to be used to [...] "provide some 20 kw of power". It was modified slightly from the original design and Coventry University, which helped with the design, went on to utilize a separate type that was called the Sea Clam.|$|R
50|$|Stephen Salter's 1974 {{invention}} {{became known}} as <b>Salter's</b> <b>duck</b> or nodding duck, although it was officially {{referred to as the}} Edinburgh Duck. In small scale controlled tests, the Duck's curved cam-like body can stop 90% of wave motion and can convert 90% of that to electricity giving 81% efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Salter's</b> <b>duck,</b> {{also known}} as the nodding duck or by its {{official}} name the Edinburgh duck, is a device that converts wave power into electricity. The wave impact induces rotation of gyroscopes located inside a pear-shaped [...] "duck", and an electrical generator converts this rotation into electricity with an overall efficiency of up to 90%. The <b>Salter's</b> <b>duck</b> was invented by Stephen Salter in response to the oil shortage in the 1970s {{and was one of the}} earliest generator designs proposed to the Wave Energy program in the United Kingdom. The funding for the project was cut off in the early 1980s after oil prices rebounded and the UK government moved away from alternative energy sources. As of 2008 no wave-power devices have ever gone into large-scale production.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 {{the inaugural}} Saltire Prize Medal {{was awarded to}} Professor Stephen Salter, who led the team which {{designed}} the <b>Salter's</b> <b>Duck</b> device in the 1970s. Dr Richard Yemm was awarded the medal in 2012. Professor Peter Fraenkel, MBE, a pioneer {{for the development of}} marine turbines, won the 2013 medal. and the 2014 medal went to Allan Thomson of Aquamarine Power.|$|R
5000|$|While {{historic}} {{references to}} the power of waves do exist, the modern scientific pursuit of wave energy was begun in the 1970s by Stephen Salter, in response to the Oil Crisis. His 1974 invention became known as <b>Salter's</b> <b>Duck</b> or Nodding Duck, although it was officially referred to as the [...] "Edinburgh Duck". In small scale controlled tests, the Duck's curved cam-like body can stop 90% of wave motion and can convert 90% of that to electricity. According to sworn testimony before the House of Parliament, The UK Wave Energy programme was shut down on 19 March 1982, in a closed meeting. An analysis of <b>Salter's</b> <b>Duck</b> resulted in a miscalculation of the estimated cost of energy production by a factor of 10, an error which was only recently identified. Some wave power advocates believe that this error, combined with a general lack of enthusiasm for renewable energy in the 1980s (after oil prices fell), hindered the advancement of wave power technology.|$|R
50|$|Aquamarine Power was a {{wave energy}} company, {{which was founded}} in 2005 to commercialise a wave energy device concept known as the Oyster wave energy converter. The company's head offices were based in Edinburgh. The company had further {{operations}} in Orkney, Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United States. Its chief executive officer was Martin McAdam, who joined the company in 2008. The company was advised by Trevor Whittaker, inventor of the Oyster concept, and Stephen Salter, inventor of the <b>Salter's</b> <b>Duck.</b> The company ceased to trade on 20 November 2015.|$|R
5000|$|The use {{of these}} three {{formulas}} allowed Swift-Hook to determine that <b>Salter's</b> <b>duck</b> is able to convert [...] "90% of the wave energy into mechanical energy". However, this percentage was lower when the duck was tested in a laboratory. In varying types of realistic conditions, {{the efficiency of the}} duck varies wildly and often drops to around 50%, as ducks are more often used in rough weather in order to convert enough wave power. Conversely, ducks are not useful in calm weather, as the waves would not have enough energy for there to be any efficiency in converting it.|$|R
50|$|The Freddy and Freddy II {{projects}} were initiated and overseen by Donald Michie. The mechanical hardware and analogue electronics were {{designed and built}} by Stephen Salter (who also pioneered renewable energy from waves (see <b>Salter's</b> <b>Duck)),</b> and the digital electronics and computer interfacing were designed by Harry Barrow and Gregan Crawford. The software was developed by {{a team led by}} Rod Burstall, Robin Popplestone and Harry Barrow which used the POP-2 programming language, one of the world's first functional programming languages. The computing hardware was an Elliot 4130 computer with 384KB (128K 24-bit words) RAM and a hard disk linked to a small Honeywell H316 computer with 16KB of RAM which directly performed sensing and control.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Most of the {{developments}} in wave power {{have concentrated on}} {{the conversion of the}} energy in the wave into a form which can be converted into electrical energy by conventional high speed rotary generators. For example in the oscillating water column (OWC) shown in Figure 1, the column produces a low-speed reciprocating linear motion moving at a velocity in the region of 0. 5 to 1 m/s, which is converted to high speed unidirectional rotation by the air duct and Wells' turbine. Other devices such as the Bristol Cylinder and <b>Salter's</b> <b>Duck</b> employ hydraulic ring main systems to convert low speed reciprocating motion into high rotational speed. This mechanical interface required for speed conversion forms the main component of the so-called Electrical & Mechanical Plant (E&M), which according to Thorpe is the most costly part of a WEC [1]. In addition turbines and hydraulic systems contribute to energy losses; {{and in the case of}} hydraulic systems maintenance would be req...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{prototype of}} <b>Salter's</b> <b>duck</b> {{was made of}} [...] "a string of floating vanes of rudimentary duck cross-sections linked through a central spine". The string itself had 12 ducks attached to it that were [...] "50 cm wide mounted on a spine 27 cm in diameter and 6 m long." [...] It was made at Coventry University, with materials from Ready Made Concrete and Insituform. The final design worked by having 20 to 30 ducks connected together by the jointed spine, with each duck moving with the waves that hit it and transferring {{the energy of the}} impact to [...] "six to ten pumps" [...] for each duck. The pear shape of the ducks have them facing the waves due to the decided orientation of their spine so that they rock and turn over when a wave hits them. This causes four gyroscopes inside to move back and forth, creating hydraulic energy that is transferred to a turbine or generator.|$|R
40|$|The WEPTOS {{wave energy}} {{converter}} (WEC) is a novel device that combines an established and efficient wave energy absorbing mechanism with a smart structure, which can regulate the amount of incoming wave energy and reduce loads in extreme wave conditions. This adjustable A-shaped slack-moored and floating structure absorbs {{the energy of the}} waves through a multitude of rotors. The shape of the rotors is based on the renowned <b>Salter’s</b> <b>Duck.</b> On each leg, the rotors pivot around a common axle, through which the rotors transfer the absorbed power to a common power take off system. The study investigates the required capacity of the power take off (PTO) system and the structural forces on a WEPTOS WEC prototype, intended for installation at Hanstholm (Denmark), based on large scale experimental tests using a highly realistic laboratory model of the complete device. The results hereof includes the rotational speed and transmitted torque (and hereby power) to the PTO system using different PTO control strategies, the impact of fluctuations of the available mechanical power and the effect of limiting the PTO capacity on the annual energy production. Acquisition of structural forces includes mooring forces and structural bending moments in both production and extreme wave conditions, illustrating that the regulation of the angle in the A shape ensures that extreme forces on the structure can be kept in the same order of magnitude as in production conditions...|$|R
40|$|The WEPTOS is a {{well-known}} wave energy converter (www. weptos. com), formed by several rotors, with a shape that draws upon the reputable <b>Salters</b> <b>Duck</b> geometry. The WEPTOS has a large efficiency under waves of one particular frequency, i. e. when resonance conditions occur. In order to extend the range of resonance conditions, the possible use of a negative stiffness in the rotor system is analysed. This note presents some considerations {{on the effectiveness of}} negative stiffness based on physical model experiments and on the numerical simulations used to interpret the test results. More specifically, the aim of the work is to evaluate how the WEPTOS performance is affected by the presence of a spring into the system that enhances the rotor oscillations applying a negative (un-stabilizing) torque proportional to the degree of rotation. Experiments were carried out in the deepwater wave basin of Aalborg University, on a 1 : 30 scale model of one rotor of the WEPTOS. Three different configurations were analysed, providing different values of the negative stiffness. A set of 16 regular and 5 irregular wave conditions were tested, with maximum heights up to approximately 6 m at prototype scale, periods ranging from 5 to 9 s. The incident wave characteristics, the device rotations and the power dissipated by a dummy power converter were accurately measured. The effect of the negative stiffness was partly hindered by the presence of friction, so that no conclusive evidence could be drawn. A simple numerical model, where the rotor was interpreted as an oscillating mass-damper- spring system, was set up and calibrated to the experimental results. Reasonably good agreement between predictions and measurements were found at model scale. The numerical simulations at prototype dimensions, where friction effects have a relatively lower importance, revealed that the springs responsible of the negative stiffness increase in fact the efficiency of the device...|$|R
