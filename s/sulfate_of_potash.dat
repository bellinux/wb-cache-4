25|$|Until the Industrial Revolution, soapmaking was {{conducted}} {{on a small scale}} and the product was rough. In 1780 James Keir established a chemical works at Tipton, for the manufacture of alkali from the <b>sulfates</b> <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> and soda, to which he afterwards added a soap manufactory. The method of extraction proceeded on a discovery of Keir's. Andrew Pears started making a high-quality, transparent soap in 1807 in London. His son-in-law, Thomas J. Barratt, opened a factory in Isleworth in 1862.|$|R

In 1780 Keir, in conjunction with Alexander Blair (then retired from the army), established a chemical works at Tipton, near Dudley, for the manufacture of alkali from the <b>sulfates</b> <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> and soda, to which he afterwards added a soap manufactory. The method of extraction proceeded on a discovery of Keir's. A nearby road was called Soap Factory Road, though it is now called Factory Road.|$|R

He gained a prize of 12,000 gulden (≈117 kg silver) for his new method <b>of</b> employing sodium <b>sulfate</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> {{in the making of}} glass. From 1817 to 1820, he held the post of superintendent of mines and was raised to the rank of nobility for his services. He retired in 1820, and thereafter published one of the best of his works, Fermenta Cognitionis in 6 parts from 1822 to 1825. In it, he combats modern philosophy and recommends the study of Böhme. In 1826, when the new university was opened in Munich, he was appointed professor of philosophy and speculative theology. He published some of his lectures there in 4 parts from 1827 to 1836 under the title [...] In 1838, he publicly opposed the interference of the Roman Catholic Church in civil matters and, in consequence, was interdicted from lecturing on the philosophy of religion during the last three years of his life. He died on 23 May 1841. He is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.|$|R
5000|$|Solar {{evaporation}} is {{the oldest}} and most energy-efficient method of mineral production. At the Great Salt Lake near Ogden, Utah, Compass Minerals draws naturally occurring brine out of the lake into shallow ponds and allows solar evaporation to produce salt, <b>sulfate</b> <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> (SOP) and magnesium chloride. Its SOP plant at the Great Salt Lake is the largest in North America and one of only three SOP brine solar evaporation operations in the world. Annual capacity is 350,000 tons of SOP, 1.5 million tons of salt, and 750,000 tons of magnesium chloride. (Source: Compass Minerals 2012 Annual Report) ...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Many {{countries}} import potassic fertilizers due to {{dearth of}} K-mineral deposits. Therefore processes to obtain K-nutrient sources from sea bittern {{were developed by}} our Institute. The present investigation evaluated the fertilizer potential of three different sea bittern-derived (SBD) potassium forms developed viz., potassium schoenite, potassium nitrate and potassium ammonium sulfate on maize productivity in two cropping seasons. Methods: The pot and field experiments consisted of four treatments, wherein the three K forms were applied at the recommended rate of 40 kg K 2 O ha− 1 and were compared with commercially used <b>sulfate</b> <b>of</b> <b>potash.</b> The effect of these fertilizers on different parameters of plant and soil were evaluated. Results: The application of SBD-potassic fertilizers led to enhancement in growth, productivity and quality of maize which related well with higher photosynthesis, nutrient uptake and soil quality parameters. On an average all the three forms of sea bittern-derived potash enhanced yield of maize over control by 22. 3 and 23. 8 %, respectively, in pot and field trials. The best performance was under SBD-KNO 3, which also recorded the highest benefit: cost ratio of 1. 76. Conclusion: The K-fertilizers derived from sea-bittern—a waste product of salt industry—can thus be economically used to improve crop production sustainably...|$|E
40|$|Objective of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of different controlled release fertilizer technologies on nutrient leaching and plant growth parameters of two palm species, Chinese Fan (Livistona chinensis) and Queen (Syagrus romanzoffiana). We compared Nutri-Pak (12 - 4 - 12 controlled release packet) and Harrell’s (12 - 4 - 12 controlled release polymer coated urea) against Atlantic (8 - 4 - 12 controlled release polymer coated urea, coated <b>sulfate</b> <b>of</b> <b>potash),</b> the most commonly used palm fertilizer in South Florida. Plants were grown in 25 cm (11 L) pots under 70 % shade, watered weekly, with pest and weed control done as required. Plant growth parameters: number of leaves, leaf length and width, and basal diameter, were measured every two months. Leachate was collected weekly after irrigation and a two-month composite sample was analyzed for nutrient concentrations. There was no difference in the growth parameters among the three fertilizers for Chinese Fan plants. However for Queen, Atlantic and Harrell’s had significantly thicker basal diameter than Nutri-Pak. Significant difference in the concentration of nutrients in the leachate was observed among the fertilizer types. Throughout the study period, Nutri-Pak had a lower concentration of nutrients in the leachate than Atlantic and Harrell’s. Our research indicates that Nutri-Pak control release fertilizer is comparable to other commercial fertilizers in Chinese Fan growth, but the larger Queen palms likely require an additional packet. Nutri-Pak fertilizer resulted in less nutrient leaching and could be a better environmental choice...|$|E

30|$|Under field conditions, {{the effect}} of {{different}} application rates (100 – 1000  kg ha− 1) of RP-EC with PSM and with a combination ratio of RP and compost (50 : 50  W/W), applied 7 days before sowing, on nodulation, growth and productivity of chickpea compared to control (60  kg P ha− 1 using DAP) was investigated at the University research farm. The treatments were arranged using randomized complete block design (RCBD) in triplicate. For sowing, hand drill was used to maintain row to row distance of 40  cm. After a week, plant to plant distance (30  cm) was maintained by thinning. The recommended rate of N and K (25 and 25  kg ha− 1) were applied in control using urea and <b>sulfate</b> <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> (SOP). Remaining N and P were applied through urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP) after analysis and calculations for available N and P in treatments where RP-EC was applied. Rhizobia and PSM inoculum were prepared using standard methods as described above and were applied in all the treatments. The inoculated seeds were sown in respective plots (1.5  ×  1.5  m 2). Similar standard methods as described in pot experiments were adopted for the estimation of agronomic and yield parameters at maturity and P contents from grain and straw samples (Olsen et al. 1954; Ryan et al. 2001). Each treatment in triplicate was randomly selected using a square meter ring and plants were harvested at the flowering stage for nodulation parameters. Number of nodules plant− 1 were counted manually and their dry wt. using digital balance.|$|E
