40|$|When {{switching}} times {{are no longer}} dominated by the plasma formation time, such as for photoconductive <b>switching</b> of high-voltage <b>spark</b> gaps, electrodynamic details of the switching process determine the rise time and pulse shape of the switched pulse. We show that the commonly used zero-dimensional lumped element and one-dimensional transmission line theory are no longer sufficient for optimizing such fast-switching devices, because important electromagnetic-field propagation in three dimensions is neglected. In order to improve {{the output of the}} photoconductively <b>switched</b> <b>spark</b> gap, we developed an optimization procedure for spark gap geometries based on full three-dimensional electrodynamic simulations. By monitoring the electromagnetic-field propagation in time, it will be shown that the initial electromagnetic-field disturbance in the gap reflects at the outer conductor and interferes with the initial field. The reflection and interference are essential for the shape of the output signal. We propose the following optimization procedure to improve the output of the photoconductively <b>switched</b> coaxial <b>spark</b> gap. Initially, the reflection and interference can be influenced by reshaping the inner conductor. The outer conductor can be used to fine-tune the system to get an output pulse with a sharp rising edge and no significant oscillations.

40|$|Summary form only given. Spark-gap {{switches}} {{are currently}} extensively used in pulse power systems. High power pulsed applications, however, require fast rise time and low inductance of the switch. The advantage {{of using a}} multiple gap <b>switch</b> (several <b>spark</b> gaps in series) is its sharpening effect.

40|$|In this contribution, a photoconductively <b>switched</b> {{high-voltage}} <b>spark</b> {{gap with}} an emphasis on theswitching behavior is modeled. It is known experimentally that not all of the voltage that is present at the input of the <b>spark</b> gap is <b>switched,</b> but rather a fraction of it drops across the spark gap. This voltage drop depends on the voltage that is present at the input of the spark gap with higher voltages resulting in a smaller drop. We have investigated two possible causes of this: the cathode fall and the resistance of the plasma arc. Using an analytical model of the cathode fall, we have established that the cathode fall can be excluded as the cause of the observed voltage drop. A one-dimensional, time-dependent non-local thermal equilibrium fluid model of the arc plasma has been made. Using this model, the plasma properties have been analyzed for various values of the switched current with emphasis on the conductivity. A good qualitative match between the observed and the simulated dissipation in the gap was found. This indicates that the finite arc resistance is the cause of the observed voltage drop...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{resolve the}} {{problems}} of short working life and narrow operating voltage range of the spark gap with one-offin gas filling structure, a spark gap with repeatable gas filling structure was designed. The spark gap was composed of three electrodes and two gaps as well as gas filling devices. Electrodes structures adopted the form of field aberration three-electrode gas <b>spark</b> <b>switch</b> forming two discharge gaps between three electrodes of anode, cathode and triggering electrode. Gas filling devices were composed of fast connector, gas pipe, barometer and air valve, by which the gaps could be repeatedly charged and deflated from a hole {{at the center of}} anode. Working life is lengthened by exchanging gas, and operating voltage range is widened by changing gas pressure in a certain range. The spark gap was manufactured and applied successfully in a TEA CO 2 laser with pulse energy 170 J. The results prove the designs feasible...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{experimental}} investigation of the photoconductively <b>switched</b> gas-filled <b>spark</b> gap. When the laser intensity of a femtosecond laser is high enough (around 1018 Wm- 2), a plasma can be created that spans the complete distance between the electrodes. The gas-filled spark gap is then closed on a femtosecond timescale, similar to photoconductive switching of a semiconductor switch. Stochastic breakdown processes, such as avalanche and streamer formation that cause the breakdown in laser triggered spark gaps, are passed over, which results in faster risetime and less jitter. Measurements of the switched pulses {{as a function of}} laser energy were performed in a 1 mm gap at an applied voltage of 4. 5 kV. A clear transition from triggering to switching was measured with increased laser energy. Measurements of the output pulses with the gap filled with nitrogen at 1 atm showed results very similar to measurements in air in the same gap. In the switching regime, the amplitude of the switched pulse did not depend strongly on the laser energy. Measurements at lower applied voltages but with the same gap distance showed {{that it was possible to}} switch voltages as low as 10 % of the self-breakdown voltage. At low applied voltages, a significant difference between the applied voltage and the output voltage is measured. A possible explanation is given based on the dynamic behavior of the laser created plasma.

The rise time of the switched pulses in the different models does not differ significantly.
