25|$|Additionally, {{the floor}} shift lever also has another plane of operation, for manual mode, with {{spring-loaded}} + and − positions. This plane is selected {{by moving the}} stick away from the driver (in vehicles with the driver's seat on the right, the lever is pushed to the left, and in left-hand drive cars, the stick is pushed to the right) when in D mode only. When this plane is selected, the DSG can now be controlled like a manual gearbox, albeit only under a sequential <b>shift</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{timing of}} the first raid was {{influenced}} by advice given by Sir Malcolm McAlpine, {{the chairman of the}} construction company Sir Robert McAlpine, who suggested that the Watten site should be attacked while the concrete was still setting. On 27 August 1943, 187 B-17 Flying Fortresses of the US 8th Air Force attacked the site with devastating effect. The fortified train station {{on the north side of}} the bunker was especially badly damaged, as concrete had just been poured there. Dornberger later wrote that following the attack the site was [...] "a desolate heap of concrete, steel, props and planking. The concrete hardened. After a few days the shelter was beyond saving. All we could do was roof in a part and use it for other work." [...] The bombing killed and injured hundreds of the slave workers on site; although the Allies had sought to avoid casualties by timing the raid with what they thought was a change of shifts, the <b>shift</b> <b>pattern</b> had been changed by the Germans at the last minute to achieve the day's work quota.|$|E
30|$|Finding {{polarity}} <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> automatically in a corpus is not easy. The {{density of}} polarity shifting is normally low, and <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> are subtle and flexible, making {{the task of}} extracting polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> difficult. Currently, human annotating is the main way to obtain polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns,</b> which is time-consuming. This paper will present a semi-automatic approach to extracting polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> from specially designed corpora. This approach used sequence mining to generate frequent word sequences, which greatly reduced human labor in annotating polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> compared with annotating the original corpus directly.|$|R

2500|$|Aisin's {{transmission}} {{was generally}} unpopular among Ion reviewers {{because of a}} so-called [...] "shift flare" [...] {{that was not a}} defect, but, nevertheless, a disorienting feature of the designed <b>shift</b> <b>pattern</b> that resulted in some drivers becoming alarmed when the transmission downshifted [...] on a downward incline (as the driver released the gas pedal).|$|E

2500|$|When the {{floor-mounted}} {{gear selector}} lever is in position D, the DSG works in fully automatic mode, with {{emphasis placed on}} gear shifts programmed to deliver maximum fuel economy.

As an example, on the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 GTI, sixth gear will be engaged around , when initially using the DSG transmission with the default ECU adaptation; although with an [...] "aggressive" [...] or [...] "sporty" [...] driving style, the adaptive <b>shift</b> <b>pattern</b> will increase the vehicle speed at which sixth gear engages.|$|E

30|$|However, a contextual word made {{it harder}} to find a {{polarity}} <b>shifting</b> <b>pattern.</b> For example, 大 da “big” is a contextual polar word. If it is classified as a positive word, then it should fail in helping to find a polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>pattern.</b> For example, 噪声很大 zaosheng hen da “the noise is very big” is a bad comment, but 很X hen X “very X” is not a polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>pattern.</b> For this reason, we did not include contextual polar words in the three experiments in this study.|$|R

2500|$|For the 1983 models {{not much}} was altered, {{but there was}} an {{increase}} in power output to [...] and [...] of torque from the same 5M-GE. The only real change in the engine area was the switch from a vacuum advanced to an electronic advanced distributor, yet that did not increase the power. Toyota switched to a 4.10:1 rear gear ratio for the P-type and a 3.73:1 for the L-type. As for the optional automatic transmission, they replaced the A43DL 4-speed with a newly designed A43DE 4-speed.

30|$|Polarity {{shifting}} is {{a phenomenon}} in sentiment analysis that denotes the inversion, attenuation, or cancelation of the sentiment of a polarity clue (i.e., word or phrase) in a sentence. A polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>pattern</b> is a pattern that performs polarity shifting. Previous {{research has shown that}} the detection of polarity shifting can improve the performance of sentiment analysis. Currently, researchers often manually check a corpus line by line to find sentences containing polarity shifting and then extract the polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>pattern.</b> However, this process is time-consuming and may miss many polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the multi-variate sequence classification problem from a multi-instance learning perspective. Real-world sequential data commonly show discriminative patterns only at specific time periods. For instance, {{we can identify}} a cropland during its growing season, but it looks similar to a barren land after harvest or before planting. Besides, even within the same class, the discriminative patterns can appear in different periods of sequential data. Due to such property, these discriminative patterns are {{also referred to as}} <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns.</b> The <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> in sequential data severely degrade the performance of traditional classification methods without sufficient training data. We propose a novel sequence classification method by automatically mining <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> from multi-variate sequence. The method employs a multi-instance learning approach to detect <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> while also modeling temporal relationships within each multi-instance bag by an LSTM model to further improve the classification performance. We extensively evaluate our method on two real-world applications - cropland mapping and affective state recognition. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in sequence classification performance and in detecting discriminative <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R

"Mud engineer" [...] is {{the name}} given to an oil field service company {{individual}} who is charged with maintaining a drilling fluid or completion fluid system on an oil and/or gas drilling rig. This individual typically works for the company selling the chemicals for the job and is specifically trained with those products, though independent mud engineers are still common. The role of the mud engineer or more properly Drilling Fluids Engineer is very critical to the entire drilling operation because even small problems with mud can stop the whole operations on rig. The internationally accepted <b>shift</b> <b>pattern</b> at off-shore drilling operations is personnel (including mud engineers) work on a 28-day <b>shift</b> <b>pattern,</b> where they work for 28 continuous days and rest the following 28 days.

30|$|In {{sentiment}} analysis, polarity shifting means {{shifting the}} polarity of a sentiment clue that expresses emotion, evaluation, etc. Compared with other {{natural language processing}} (NLP) tasks, extracting polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> from corpora is a challenging one because the methods used to shift polarity are flexible, which often invalidates fully automatic approaches. In this study, which aimed to extract polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> that inverted, attenuated, or canceled polarity, we used a semi-automatic approach based on sequence mining. This approach greatly reduced the cost of human annotating, while covering as many frequent polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> as possible. We tested this approach on different domain corpora and in different settings. Three types of experiments were performed and the experimental results were analyzed, which will be reported in this paper.|$|R
