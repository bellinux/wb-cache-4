25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will <b>say</b> <b>your</b> licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E

It {{was nominated for}} the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 2004 ceremony, but lost to [...] "Whenever I <b>Say</b> <b>Your</b> Name" [...] by Sting and Mary J. Blige. The single peaked at number 12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and charted within the top ten of record charts of several countries including Australia, Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The song was included on the setlists of Aguilera's three major concert tours: Justified and Stripped Tour (2003), The Stripped Tour (2003) and Back to Basics Tour (2006–08).|$|E

Josh Kun of Spin praised the lyrics for being more confrontational than the works of her contemporary Britney Spears.

2500|$|Owen's wife, Eliza, {{said that}} one of the men wore {{civilian}} clothes and the four others wore RIC caps and carried revolvers. John McMahon, one of Owen's sons, said [...] "Four of the five men were dressed in the uniform of the RIC but, from their appearance, I know they are Specials, not regular RIC". All of the men had hidden their faces. The four men in police uniform rushed up the stairs and herded the males into the dining room. The women were taken into another room. Eliza [...] "got down on her knees and pleaded for mercy, but was struck {{on the side of the}} head and fell to the floor". When Owen asked why his family was being singled-out, one of the gunmen said it was because he was [...] "a respected papist". The men were told, [...] "you boys <b>say</b> <b>your</b> prayers", before the gunmen opened fire.

2500|$|Liston {{failed to}} answer the bell for the seventh round, and Ali was {{declared}} the winner by technical knockout. At that point the fight was level on the official scorecards. It {{was the first time}} since 1919—when Jack Dempsey defeated Jess Willard—that a world heavyweight champion had quit on his stool. Liston said he quit because of a shoulder injury. Dr. Alexander Robbins, chief physician for the Miami Beach Boxing Commission, diagnosed Liston with a torn tendon in his left shoulder. However, David Remnick, for his book, King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero, spoke with one of Liston's cornermen, who told him that Liston could have continued: [...] " [...] was all BS. We had a return bout clause with Clay, but if you <b>say</b> <b>your</b> guy just quit, who is gonna get a return bout. We cooked up that shoulder thing on the spot." [...] Hall of Fame matchmaker Teddy Brenner also disputed the shoulder injury, claiming he saw Liston use the same arm to throw a chair in his dressing room after the match. However there is ample evidence that Liston carried an injury to his left shoulder into the fight.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the album}} version of [...] "Black Cat", the {{majority}} of the guitar riffs are played by David Barry, including the introduction, main riff, as well as a thematic solo. Barry subsequently became Jackson's touring guitarist and tour director. John McClain, former A executive for A Records, provided the slide guitar, while Jellybean Johnson provided the funky riff that punctuates the song. Terry Lewis contributes on bass guitar. Several remixes incorporate a guitar solo by Jesse Johnson or alternate production from various guitarists. The radio edit and [...] "Video Mix" [...] of [...] "Black Cat" [...] features Nuno Bettencourt of Extreme on additional rhythm guitar. An extended version with a longer guitar solo appeared on Jackson's [...] compilation, while an alternate version with a shortened solo is included on Number Ones. It was mixed by German recording engineer Michael Wagener, who had not previously worked with any pop acts and was approached due to Jackson's desire to [...] "cross over into Hard Rock." [...] Upon collaborating, Bettencourt said Jackson was [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "beautiful," [...] jokingly expressing his desire to marry her. In return for Bettencourt's contribution, Jackson was speculated to provide the spoken line [...] "Did you <b>say</b> <b>your</b> prayers? Don't forget to put your tooth under the pillow" [...] on the song [...] "Money (in God We Trust)" [...] from Extreme's sophomore album, Pornograffiti.|$|E
2500|$|Austin's rise {{to stardom}} {{began at the}} 1996 King of the Ring. He began using his {{trademark}} finishing maneuver, the Stone Cold Stunner; with this new technique, he won the King of the Ring tournament.

The Stunner debuted on June 8, 1996 on Superstars when he defeated jobber Jason Arndt, who later became known as Joey Abs {{a member of the}} Mean Street Posse. At the time, Roberts was portraying a born-again Christian, so after the match, Austin cut a now famous promo during his coronation, telling Roberts, [...] "You sit there and you thump your Bible, and you <b>say</b> <b>your</b> prayers, and it didn't get you anywhere! Talk about your Psalms, talk about ... Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!". Austin's win and rise to stardom proved to be an un-telegraphed stroke of luck. Triple H was originally scheduled to win the 1996 King of the Ring, but was punished for the infamous Curtain Call incident that had transpired earlier that year. [...] "Austin 3:16" [...] ultimately {{became one of the most}} popular catchphrases in wrestling history and subsequently the slogan became one of the best-selling T-shirts in WWE merchandise history.
