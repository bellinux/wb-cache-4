5|$|In October 2005, a 15th Anniversary edition was released. The new reprint {{contained}} Morrison and Karen Berger's annotated {{script that}} breaks down and explains {{much of the}} symbolic references in the series, as well as principal art and <b>step-by-step</b> samples of the story.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of modern Switzerland {{was a part}} of the Roman Republic and Empire for a period of about six centuries, beginning with the <b>step-by-step</b> conquest of the area by Roman armies from the 2nd century BC and ending with the decline of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids are the {{structural}} units (monomers) {{that make up}} proteins. They join together to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called translation and involves the <b>step-by-step</b> addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome. The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is a RNA copy {{of one of the}} organism's genes.|$|E
5|$|Anabolism is {{the set of}} {{constructive}} metabolic processes {{where the}} energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules. In general, the complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed <b>step-by-step</b> from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. First, the production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and nucleotides, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|Given {{there is}} no {{standardized}} format {{for the creation of}} text-based walkthroughs, guides exist that contain extensive examples and <b>step-by-step</b> instructions on how to write text-based walkthrough content. Prima Games and Computer and Video Games have produced walkthroughs. Prima Games produces official, dedicated text-based video game walkthroughs and strategy guides for a variety of video games in both print and digital formats. Computer and Video Games (CVG) published both text and video based walkthroughs of video games on their website and official YouTube channel until their closure by Future in February of 2015 in asset consolidation between various Future brands. IGN also creates and publishes video game walkthroughs in both text and video formats.|$|E
5|$|The film {{required}} a lengthy production period, taking {{over a year}} for the casting to be completed and another year and three months for editing. Burshtein, who was doubtful as to how much of the process would be completed, took a <b>step-by-step</b> approach, focusing first on the writing, then on accumulating enough funding for the project, followed by the filming and editing. Burshtein became the first Orthodox Jewish woman to direct a film intended for wide distribution. The film premiered at the 69th Venice Film Festival on 1 September 2012 and was later released in the United States on 24 May 2013.|$|E
5|$|The party standings {{as of the}} {{election}} and as of dissolution on September 7, 2008, {{are on the table}} below. Between these events, five members of the House of Commons crossed the floor, one died, twelve resigned, and nine members were elected in by-elections to fill vacancies, leaving four vacancies at dissolution. In that same period, two senators died, six reached the mandatory retirement age of 75, four resigned, and two were appointed to fill vacancies, leaving fifteen vacancies at dissolution. <b>Step-by-step</b> changes are listed in the Members section. See List of Canadian federal electoral districts for a list of the ridings in this parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{puzzle of}} how {{embryonic}} development was controlled {{began to be}} solved using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. The <b>step-by-step</b> control of its embryogenesis was visualized by attaching fluorescent dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo. A dye such as green fluorescent protein, originally from a jellyfish, was typically attached to an antibody specific to a fruit fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.|$|E
5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a <b>step-by-step</b> guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Indian {{independence}} in 1947, India was divided into two sets of territories, one under direct British rule, and the other under the suzerainty of the British Crown, with control over their internal affairs remaining {{in the hands of}} their hereditary rulers. In addition, there were several colonial enclaves controlled by France and Portugal. The political integration of these territories into India was a declared objective of the Indian National Congress, and the Government of India pursued this over the next decade. Through a combination of factors, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon convinced the rulers of the various princely states to accede to India. Having secured their accession, they then proceeded, in a <b>step-by-step</b> process, to secure and extend the central government's authority over these states and transform their administrations until, by 1956, there was little difference between the territories that had been part of British India and those that had been part of princely states. Simultaneously, the Government of India, through a combination of diplomatic and military means, acquired de facto and de jure control over the remaining colonial enclaves, which too were integrated into India.|$|E

25|$|Early exchanges were {{electromechanical}} systems using motors, shaft drives, rotating {{switches and}} relays. Some types of automatic exchanges were the Strowger switch or <b>step-by-step</b> switch, All Relay, X-Y, panel switch and the crossbar switch.|$|E
25|$|The Timelords {{released}} {{one other}} product, a 1989 book called The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way), a <b>step-by-step</b> guide to achieving a number one hit single with little money or talent.|$|E
25|$|Early {{researchers}} developed algorithms that imitated <b>step-by-step</b> {{reasoning that}} humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods {{for dealing with}} uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.|$|E
25|$|Suction pumps, {{a special}} device for lips uses vacuum pumping to {{increase}} {{blood pressure in}} each lip and to pull them out a bit, making it quite an instrument to adjust proper lip length/value in a slow determinite <b>step-by-step</b> way. One {{example of such a}} device is the Fullips enhancer.|$|E
25|$|However, such {{methods are}} good only for linear elastic systems, being largely unable {{to model the}} {{structural}} behavior when damage (i.e., non-linearity) appears. Numerical <b>step-by-step</b> integration {{proved to be a}} more effective method of analysis for multi-degree-of-freedom structural systems with significant non-linearity under a transient process of ground motion excitation.|$|E
25|$|These {{systems could}} use the old {{electromechanical}} signaling methods inherited from crossbar and <b>step-by-step</b> switches. They also introduced {{a new form of}} data communications: two 1ESS exchanges could communicate with one another using a data link called Common Channel Interoffice Signaling, (CCIS). This data link was based on CCITT 6, a predecessor to SS7.|$|E
25|$|Strowger-based, <b>step-by-step</b> {{offices in}} the Bell System {{required}} continuous maintenance, such as cleaning. Indicator lights on equipment bays in step offices alerted staff to conditions such as blown fuses (usually white lamps) or a permanent signal (stuck off-hook condition, usually green indicators). Step offices were more susceptible to single-point failures than newer technologies.|$|E
25|$|Extending {{across the}} American Midwest into Canada, Plains-area music is nasal, with high pitches and {{frequent}} falsettos, with a terraced descent (a <b>step-by-step</b> descent down an octave) in an unblended monophony. Strophes use incomplete repetition, meaning that songs {{are divided into}} two parts, the second of which is always repeated {{before returning to the}} beginning.|$|E
25|$|CATIA {{started getting}} noticed in other sectors outside of {{aeronautical}} design, {{notably in the}} automotive industry (BMW, Mercedes and Honda). The company used a <b>step-by-step</b> approach to get a start in other industries such as consumer goods, machinery, and shipbuilding. IBM itself became a customer in the mid 1980s and deployed CATIA in its engineering and manufacturing plants.|$|E
25|$|The method {{relies on}} a <b>step-by-step</b> {{progression}} based on question-and-answer sessions which begin with naming common objects such as doors, pencils, floors, etc. It provides a motivating start as the learner begins using a foreign language almost immediately. Lessons progress to verb forms and other grammatical structures {{with the goal of}} learning about thirty new words per lesson.|$|E
25|$|O’Keeffe had {{a run on}} Ireland’s TV3 with a {{show called}} Stuart’s Kitchen. His re-location to California and filming {{schedule}} stopped the network from picking up a second season but TV3 continues to develop specials and programming with O’Keeffe. O’Keeffe offers a complementary app through iTunes which enables people to make <b>step-by-step</b> recipes as they watch the show.|$|E
25|$|Also, many rules {{which have}} been {{excluded}} from the main Federation Commander modules will be included for {{those who wish to}} use them. In contrast to the <b>step-by-step</b> release schedule for various races in the main line FC sets, each race seen in SFB which will have a representation in Borders of Madness will be included in the first module.|$|E
25|$|Using SR1 as a {{starting}} point, the Simplified Spelling Society (SSS) created a five-part reform proposal called Stage 1. The proposals were first printed in the November 1983 edition of the society's newsletter. In April 1984 they were adopted as the 'house style' of the SSS at its yearly meeting. The SSS said that the reforms could be used either together or individually (as a <b>step-by-step</b> change).|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{the show}} has {{increased}} in popularity, going from a low budget, low production value channel to gaining a cult following and having over 1.1million channel subscribers. Reviews have attributed the show's popularity to its simplicity, granular <b>step-by-step</b> approach to cooking, and Francis and Chef's pleasant, anxiety-free approach. The show is among YouTube's 10 most subscribed cooking and food channels and has garnered positive attention, public appearances, and awards.|$|E
25|$|Crossbar offices {{used more}} shared, common control circuits. For example, a digit {{receiver}} (part of an element called an Originating Register) would {{be connected to}} a call {{just long enough to}} collect the subscriber's dialed digits. Crossbar architecture was more flexible than step offices. Later crossbar systems had punch-card-based trouble reporting systems. By the 1970s, automatic number identification had been retrofitted to nearly all <b>step-by-step</b> and crossbar switches in the Bell System.|$|E
25|$|During 1952, Franklin {{also refused}} to {{participate}} in molecular modeling efforts and continued to work on <b>step-by-step</b> detailed analysis of her X-ray diffraction data (Patterson synthesis). By the spring of 1952, Franklin had received permission from Randall to ask to transfer her fellowship {{so that she could}} leave King's College and work in John Bernal's laboratory at Birkbeck College, also in London. Franklin remained at King's College until the middle of March, 1953.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{it matters}} {{not only what}} web browser the {{audience}} is using but also how their operating system is configured. In 2010, type designer and consultant Thomas Phinney (Vice President of FontLab and formerly with Adobe) wrote a <b>step-by-step</b> process for finding the best rendering solution, which—more or less jokingly—uses {{a large number of}} goto statements. A more visually oriented flow chart was posted in the same year on the Typophile forum by Miha Zajec.|$|E
25|$|In 1840 Wheatstone had {{patented}} an alphabetical telegraph, or, 'Wheatstone A B C instrument,' which {{moved with}} a <b>step-by-step</b> motion, {{and showed the}} letters of the message upon a dial. The same principle was used in his type-printing telegraph, patented in 1841. This was the first apparatus which printed a telegram in type. It was worked by two circuits, and as the type revolved a hammer, actuated by the current, pressed the required letter on the paper.|$|E
25|$|Section III is {{the legal}} part of the Malleus Maleficarum that {{describes}} how to prosecute a witch. The arguments are clearly laid for the lay magistrates prosecuting witches. The section offers a <b>step-by-step</b> guide to the conduct of a witch trial, from the method of initiating the process and assembling accusations, to the interrogation (including torture) of witnesses, and the formal charging of the accused. Women who did not cry during their trial were automatically believed to be witches.|$|E
25|$|Acknowledging {{the lack}} of {{progress}} in relation to bilateral relations and the internal situation following the position adopted in 1997, the EU adopted a <b>step-by-step</b> approach in 1999, whereby sanctions would be gradually lifted upon fulfillment of the four benchmarks set by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. In 2000, some moderately positive developments toward the implementation of recommendations made by the OSCE AMG were observed but were not sufficient {{in the realm of}} access to fair and free elections.|$|E
25|$|Later, between 1967 and 1971, {{during the}} final years of the <b>step-by-step</b> {{dismantling}} of the White Australia policy, approximately 10,000 Turkish citizens settled in Australia under an agreement between Australia and Turkey. From the 1970s onwards, there was a significant shift in the government's attitude towards immigration, and with the White Australia policy now totally dismantled from 1973 onwards, instead of trying to make newer foreign nationals assimilate and forgo their heritage, the government became more accommodating and tolerant of differences by adopting a policy of multiculturalism.|$|E
