500|$|The spire was {{originally}} to be enclosed with a protective radome, {{described as a}} [...] "sculptural sheath of interlocking fiberglass panels". However, the radome-enclosed spire was changed to a plain antenna. Douglas Durst, {{the chairman of the}} Durst Organization, stated that the design change would save $20 million. However, the tower's architect, Skidmore Owings & Merrill, strongly criticized the change. David Childs, the lead designer, said, [...] "Eliminating this integral part of the building's design and leaving an exposed antenna and equipment is unfortunate...We <b>stand</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> work with the Port on an alternate design." [...] After joining the project in 2010, the Durst Organization had suggested eliminating the radome to reduce costs, but the proposal was rejected by the Port Authority's then-executive director, Christopher O. Ward. Ward was replaced by Patrick Foye in September 2011. Foye changed the Port Authority's position, and the radome was removed from the plans. In 2012, Douglas Durst gave a statement regarding the final decision: [...] "(the antenna) is going to be mounted on the building over the summer. There's no way to do anything at this point." ...|$|E

[...] Levinson and Fontana considered leaving Baltimore not only for the cost savings, but also because of the letters of outrage by the city's detectives over [...] "See No Evil," [...] as well as a report in the Associated Press that the show was giving Baltimore a bad image by drawing attention to its murder rate. Ultimately, however, Levinson decided to remain in Baltimore. On February 15, 1994, the day the options of the cast contracts expired, NBC decided at midnight to sign for a third season, but ordered only 13 episodes instead of a full 22-episode season, opting to wait and see how the ratings performed before committing to the final nine.|$|E

2500|$|The {{move was}} {{described}} as an [...] "earthquake" [...] by an Israeli official who wished to remain anonymous, and prompted harsh criticism by prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu who said in a broadcast statement: [...] "As prime minister of Israel, I will not allow {{the hundreds of thousands}} of Israelis who live in the West Bank, Golan Heights and our united capital Jerusalem to be harmed. We will not accept any external diktats about our borders. This matter will only be settled in direct negotiations between the parties." [...] Israel is also concerned that the same policy could extend to settlement produce and goods exported to European markets, as some EU member states are pressing for an EU-wide policy of labelling produce and goods originating in Jewish settlements to allow consumers to make informed choices. A special ministerial panel led by prime minister Netanyahu, decided to approach the EU and demand several key amendments in the guidelines before entering any new projects with the Europeans. A spokesperson for the EU confirmed that further talks would take place between Israel and the EU, stating: [...] "We <b>stand</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> organise discussions during which such clarifications can be provided and look forward to continued successful EU-Israel cooperation, including in the area of scientific cooperation." ...|$|E
