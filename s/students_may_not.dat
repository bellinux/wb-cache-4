The högskoleexamen is usually not offered, and many schools require students to obtain the kandidatexamen before obtaining a magisterexamen or masterexamen. Most third-cycle programmes require at least a magisterexamen, although the legal requirement is only the kandidatexamen.|$|E

College rules stipulate that <b>students</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> pledge to join a Greek organization until their sophomore year. There is also Kappa Kappa Psi, a band service fraternity, as well as Alpha Phi Omega, a service fraternity; both of these can be pledged as freshman.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some have criticised the over-reliance on private tuition, saying that <b>students</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> pay {{attention}} during lessons {{as they are}} able to fall back on their tuition classes later. Students may also be unable to find answers on their own, having relied on their tutors for answers during their school years. Some tuition centres reportedly do schoolwork on their students' behalf. Others have also criticised private tuition for taking up too much of students' free time. Due to the high cost of tuition, there are concerns that low-income families were unable to send their children for such classes. However, the government have partially subsidised private tuition at certain community bodies for children from low-income families.|$|E
25|$|In the {{academic}} world, plagiarism by students is usually considered {{a very serious}} offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution. Generally, the punishment increases as a person enters higher institutions of learning. The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that <b>students</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study {{did not have a}} good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were very confident that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are. The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.|$|E

50|$|On March 19, 2010, the North Carolina Community College System enacted {{their new}} policy stating “Each college shall {{maintain}} an open-door admission policy to all applicants who are legal {{residents of the}} United States and who are either high school graduates or are at least 18 years of age”. A community college can admit an undocumented student if the student applying attended and graduated from a United States high school that operates in compliance with state or local law. The undocumented <b>student</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> receive any state or federal financial aid {{in the form of}} a grant or loan and the undocumented <b>student</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be considered as a North Carolina resident for tuition purposes; therefore being charged out-of-state tuition wherever they may live. In deciding to admit an undocumented student, the student cannot enroll in a program that grants them a professional license, which is also prohibited by federal law.|$|R
25|$|The {{historic}} Georgia Arch {{which sits}} on the edge of North campus was installed in 1864. It serves as the official icon and a historic landmark for the University. Since the 1900s, tradition has held that <b>students</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> pass beneath the Arch until they have received a diploma from the University of Georgia. Those who walked under the Arch prior to graduation commencement were to said to never graduate. The tradition began when Daniel Huntley Redfearn, Class of 1910, arrived as a freshman from Boston, Georgia and vowed not to pass beneath the Arch until he had graduated. One of Redfearn's professors heard the vow and repeated it to his class, and the tradition has stood ever since. Many freshmen, learning of the tradition during orientation or from other sources still choose to honor the century-old tradition. Years of following the tradition are visible on the concrete steps leading to the Arch. Steps to each side have been worn down over the years as undergraduates have kept their vows.|$|E

Men and women are not allowed in each other's dorm rooms, and underclassmen are subject to a curfew. Firearms are prohibited on campus. The college has a number of traditions rooted in dorm life, including [...] "bobtisms" [...] — a portmanteau of Baptism and [...] "Lake Bob", in which newly engaged males are dunked. All dorm activities are subject to the discretion of the men's and women's Resident Directors.|$|E

2500|$|For many parents, the {{decision}} {{of whether or not}} to enroll students into school-based speech therapy or privately practiced therapy is challenging. Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, some <b>students</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, {{students are more likely to}} qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability.|$|E
2500|$|More extracurricular {{activities}} and [...] "more peaceful" [...] classrooms {{are among the}} praises for the program. However, {{for the majority of}} the courses, little to no extra work is completed in the advanced stream versus the regular courses. Unlike the IB program, Alberta Learning states that <b>students</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> switch between the lowest streams and Advanced Placement in grades 11 and 12; but they can switch between the various streams in grades 9 and 10. Both AP and IB programs are presented based on their different strengths and weaknesses, and students are encouraged to select their high school based on other factors such as their location in Lethbridge. Annually, LCI students take provincial advanced placement exams in various subjects, including World History, literature and physics, in grade 12.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, the Supreme Court {{would decide}} in Minersville School District v. Gobitis {{that members of}} the Jehovah's Witnesses in a school could be {{required}} to salute the flag. [...] The ruling in Gobitis, however, did not stand for long. In 1943, West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, the Supreme Court essentially reversed its previous opinion. Justice Frankfurter had, in the Gobitis case, suggested that the Witnesses attempt to reverse the School Board's policy by exercising their vote. In the Barnette case, however, Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote, [...] "the very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities ... One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote." [...] The Supreme Court did not rule that the Pledge was unconstitutional; rather, they held that <b>students</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be compelled to recite it.|$|E

Glenn {{claims that}} Speak [...] "has generated more academic response {{than any other}} novel Anderson has written." [...] Despite hesitancy to teach a novel with [...] "mature subject matter," [...] English teachers are implementing Speak in the classroom as a study of literary analysis, as well as tool to teach students about sexual harassment. The novel gives {{students the opportunity to}} talk about several teen issues, including: school cliques, sex, and parental relationships. Of teaching Speak in the classroom Jackett says, [...] "We have the opportunity as English teachers to have an enormously positive impact on students' lives. Having the courage to discuss the issues found in Speak is one way to do just that." [...] By sharing in Melinda's struggles, students may find their own voices and learn to cope with trauma and hardships. According to Janet Alsup, teaching Speak in the classroom, can help students become more critically literate. <b>Students</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> feel comfortable talking about their own experiences, but they are willing to talk about what happens to Melinda. Elaine O'Quinn claims that books like Speak allow students to explore inner dialogue. Speak provides an outlet for students to think critically about their world.|$|E
