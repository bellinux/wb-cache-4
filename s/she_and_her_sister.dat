5|$|In 1677, Sarah's brother Ralph died, and <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister,</b> Frances, became co-heirs of the Jennings estates in Hertfordshire and Kent. John chose Sarah over Catherine Sedley, {{but both}} John's and Sarah's {{families}} disapproved of the match, therefore they married secretly {{in the winter}} of 1677–78.|$|E
5|$|An American design, , {{authorized}} in 1905 {{and laid}} down in December 1906, was another of the first dreadnoughts, but <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister,</b> , were not launched until 1908. Both used triple-expansion engines and had a superior layout of the main battery, dispensing with Dreadnoughts wing turrets. They thus retained the same broadside, despite having two fewer guns.|$|E

5|$|At the {{completion}} of her second round of winter Fleet maneuvers {{in the spring of}} 1917, Wadsworth returned north as far as Hampton Roads. As America's entry into World War I approached, <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> destroyers began patrolling the Norfolk–Yorktown area to protect the naval bases and ships there against potential incursions by German submarines.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{took part}} in the Second battle of Vera Cruz in 1914. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> Utah were the first two ships on the scene; the two ships landed some 1,000 sailors and Marines under the command of Floridas captain on 21 April.

5|$|When the Welsh {{family moved}} to Los Angeles, the Earps {{accepted}} an invitation to stay {{with them for a}} while in their top-floor apartment until the Earps found a place to rent. After Earp and Sadie moved into a bungalow nearby, Charlie Welsh's daughter, Grace Spolidora, recalled that Sadie, who had never had many domestic skills, did very little housekeeping or cooking for Wyatt. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> Alma were concerned about the care Sadie gave Wyatt. Though he was at times very ill, she still did not cook for him. Spolidora, her sisters, and her mother brought in meals.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{designed}} as a minelayer, the German Navy never operated her as such. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> were used to raid a British convoy to Norway in October 1917. The two cruisers sank two escorting destroyers and nine of the twelve merchant ships of the convoy. The Kaiserliche Marine considered sending the two ships to attack convoys in the Atlantic Ocean, but the difficulties associated with refueling at sea convinced the Germans to abandon the plan. Brummer {{was included in the}} list of ships interned at Scapa Flow following the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the scuttling of the fleet. Brummer was successfully scuttled, and unlike most of the other wrecks, she was never raised for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|Deutschland {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the High Seas Fleet until 1913, when she {{was transferred to the}} II Battle Squadron. With the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> ships were tasked with defending the mouth of the Elbe and the German Bight from possible British incursions. Deutschland and the other ships of the II Battle Squadron participated in most of the large-scale fleet operations {{in the first two years}} of the war, culminating in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916. Late on the first day of the battle, Deutschland and the other pre-dreadnoughts briefly engaged several British battlecruisers before retreating.|$|E
5|$|Hal Rogers {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{because he had}} posted bail for his brother, knowing he had abused Michelle. He later {{said that he had}} promised the family he would post bail and would not renege on his promise. Investigators from Florida and Ohio also discovered that Hal Rogers had withdrawn US$7,000 from his bank {{at the time of the}} disappearance, which he was able to account for. He had planned on using it to look for his wife and daughters before he was notified of their deaths. Investigations proved conclusively that he had never left Ohio during that period. The rape of Michelle Rogers, and gossip by local people, was one of the reasons for the Florida trip, so <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> and mother could distance themselves from the incident.|$|E

50|$|A {{member of}} the Sisters of Sin, Slash was a young disciple of the Red Skull. Her {{physical}} age was accelerated into an old woman, calling herself Sister Agony because of the razor-sharp talons she had in place of <b>her</b> hands. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>Sisters</b> attacked Captain America but were defeated. She was eventually restored to her natural age. However, soon after, she returned alongside the Sisters of Sin, this time as a young adult. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sisters</b> were once again defeated by Captain America.|$|R
5|$|Sevastopol {{began her}} sea trials on 16 October 1899, and was {{commissioned}} after their conclusion into the Imperial Russian Navy. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> ships {{were transferred to}} Port Arthur, which was then the port of the First Squadron of the Russian Pacific Fleet. In September 1900, Popov radios were installed on Sevastopol and her sister Poltava, the first Russian battleships to have them. They were also painted white, {{the same color as}} the other ships in the First Pacific Squadron. She then left for Port Arthur and arrived at on 13 April 1901. As Russia was not at war with any Far East countries at that time, Sevastopol stayed in port, inactive.|$|E
5|$|The first {{member of}} the group to join S.M. Entertainment's {{training}} system was Jessica in 2000, after <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister,</b> Krystal Jung, were scouted in a mall in South Korea during a family vacation. That same year, members Sooyoung and Hyoyeon were cast into S.M.'s training system through the 2000 S.M. Open Audition, in which Hyoyeon danced for her audition. Yuri was the next Girls' Generation member to become an S.M. trainee after coming second in the 2001 S.M. Youth Best Dancer competition. Yoona was cast the following year through the 2002 S.M. Saturday Open Casting Audition, where she sang and danced to her favorite singers, BoA and Britney Spears. Seohyun, the group's youngest member, was scouted in the subway by an S.M. scout; she then auditioned in 2003, singing children's songs.|$|E
5|$|The ship saw limited action during World War I. Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I {{opted to}} remain neutral until October 1916, when {{pressure}} from the Triple Entente forced him to abdicate {{in favor of a}} pro-Entente government. For the remainder of the war, Kilkis operated solely as a harbor defense ship. In the immediately ensuing Greco-Turkish War of 19191922, Kilkis supported Greek landings in Turkey and participated in the final Greek sea-borne withdrawal in 1922. She remained in service into the early 1930s, when she was used for a training ship. During the German invasion of Greece in 1941, <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> were sunk in Salamis by German Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers. The two ships were ultimately raised in the 1950s and broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|When she was {{ten years}} old, Maria began {{attending}} the boarding school of J. Sikorska; next she attended a gymnasium for girls, from which she graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal. After a collapse, possibly due to depression, she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, {{and the next year}} with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring. Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> Bronisława became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Johnson taught {{part-time}} at the Nottingham School of Art, {{and managed}} to have Knight enrolled as an 'artisan student' there, paying no fees, aged just 13. At the age of fifteen, and still a student herself, Knight took over her mother's teaching duties when Charlotte {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and became seriously ill. Later Knight won a scholarship and the gold medal in the national student competition held by the then South Kensington Museum. She continued to give private lessons after she left the School of Art, as both <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> Evangeline Agnes, known as Sissie, had been left to live alone on very little money, after the deaths of their mother, their sister Nellie and both their grandmothers. At the School of Art, Laura met {{one of the most promising}} students, Harold Knight, then aged 17, and determined that the best method of learning was to copy Harold's technique. They became friends, and married in 1903.|$|E
5|$|In early 1924, Florida {{took part}} in the Fleet Problem III maneuvers, where <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> Utah acted as stand-ins for the new s. In June 1924, Florida was taken out of service for a {{modernization}} at the Boston Navy Yard, which lasted from 1 April 1925 to 1 November 1926. During the reconstruction, her deck armor was strengthened and anti-torpedo blisters were installed to increase her resistance to underwater damage. Her secondary battery was rearranged to improve its efficiency, and four of her 5-inch guns, which were mounted in sponsons, were removed. She was also reboilered with four White-Forster oil-fired models that had been removed from the battleships and battlecruisers scrapped {{as a result of the}} Washington Naval Treaty. Her Parsons turbines were replaced with new Curtis geared turbines and her two funnels were trunked into one stack. The rear lattice mast was replaced with a pole mast, which was moved further aft. Her two submerged torpedo tubes were also removed.|$|E

5|$|The keel for Re di Portogallo {{was laid}} {{down at the}} William H. Webb Shipyard in New York City in December 1861; <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> were the only Italian ironclads {{to be built in}} the United States. She was {{launched}} on 29 August 1863 and completed just under a year later, on 23 August 1864. Re di Portogallo then crossed the Atlantic and joined the Italian fleet. In June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, as part of the Third Italian War of Independence, which was fought concurrently with the Austro-Prussian War. The Italian fleet commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, initially adopted a cautious course of action; he was unwilling to risk battle with the Austrian Navy, {{despite the fact that the}} Austrian fleet was much weaker than his own. Persano claimed he was simply waiting on the ironclad ram , en route from Britain, but his inaction weakened morale in the fleet, with many of his subordinates openly accusing him of cowardice.|$|E

5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget and the battleships were deemed uneconomical; as a result, Iowa was decommissioned for the last time on 26 October 1990, after a total of 19 years of commissioned service. She {{was the first of the}} reactivated battleships to be decommissioned, and this was done earlier than originally planned as a result of the damaged turret. Iowa was originally berthed at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and later at Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island from 24 September 1998 to 8 March 2001, when the ship began her journey under tow to California. The ship arrived in Suisun Bay near San Francisco on 21 April 2001 and joined the reserve fleet there, where she remained in reserve until struck again from the Naval Vessel Register in March 2006. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> ships had been struck previously in 1995.
