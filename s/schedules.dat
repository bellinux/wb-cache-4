40|$|Runtime {{incremental}} parallel <b>scheduling</b> (RIPS) is a {{new approach}} for load balancing. In parallel <b>scheduling,</b> all processors cooperate together to balance the workload. Parallel <b>scheduling</b> accurately balances the load by using global load information. In incremental <b>scheduling,</b> the system <b>scheduling</b> activity alternates with the underlying computation work. RIPS produces high-quality load balancing and adapts to applications of nonuniform structures. This paper presents methods for <b>scheduling</b> a single job on a dedicated parallel machine. 1 Introduction There are two basic <b>scheduling</b> strategies: static <b>scheduling</b> and dynamic <b>scheduling.</b> Static <b>scheduling</b> distributes the workload at compile time. Dynamic <b>scheduling</b> performs <b>scheduling</b> activities at runtime. Static <b>scheduling</b> applies to problems with a predictable structure, which are called static problems. This class of problems includes Gaussian elimination, FFT, etc. Static <b>scheduling</b> utilizes the knowledge of problem characteristics [...] ...|$|R
