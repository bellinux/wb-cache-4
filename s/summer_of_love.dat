5|$|The peak {{years of}} {{psychedelic}} rock were between 1966 and 1969, with milestone events including the 1967 <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love</b> and the 1969 Woodstock Rock Festival, becoming an international musical movement {{associated with a}} widespread counterculture before beginning a decline as changing attitudes, the loss of some key individuals and a back-to-basics movement, led surviving performers to move into new musical areas. The genre bridged the transition from early blues and folk-based rock to progressive rock and hard rock, {{and as a result}} contributed to the development of sub-genres such as heavy metal. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in various forms of neo-psychedelia.|$|E
5|$|Through {{connections}} that Cohen had with record producer Samuel Charters, the group signed a recording contract with Vanguard Records in December 1966, {{just as the}} label, which had primarily released folk music, was attempting to branch out into the growing psychedelic rock scene. While the band waited to record their debut album, they were present at the Human Be-In, along with other influential San Francisco musical acts, including Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Quicksilver Messenger Service. The event was a prelude to the <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love</b> and helped publicize counterculture ideals such as ecology, free-love {{and the use of}} illicit drugs.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, the Bay Area {{and the rest}} of Northern California became the center of the {{counterculture}} movement. Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in San Francisco were seen as centers of activity, with the hit American pop song San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair) further enticing like-minded individuals to join the movement in the Bay Area and leading to the <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love.</b> In the proceeding decades, the Bay Area would cement itself as a hotbed of New Left activism, student activism, opposition to the Vietnam War and other anti-war movements, the black power movement, and the gay rights movement. At the same time, San Jose {{and the rest of}} the South Bay began to rapidly develop as it began to transition from a largely agricultural-based economy into the hotbed of the high-tech industry. Fred Terman, the director of a top-secret research project at Harvard University during World War II, joined the faculty at Stanford University in order to reshape the university's engineering department. His students, including David Packard and William Hewlett would later help usher in the region's high-tech revolution. In 1955, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory opened for business near Stanford, and although the business venture was a financial failure, it was the first semiconductor company in the Bay Area, and the talent that it attracted to the region eventually led to a high-tech cluster of companies later known as Silicon Valley.|$|E

25|$|Hippie Hill {{has also}} been part of San Francisco’s history, namely the <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love,</b> which was a large {{counterculture}} movement that partially took part on the hill. During this <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love,</b> people gathered together to {{connect with one another}} in many ways, mainly dropping acid and playing music together. Music has its own history on the hill, with musicians and bands like Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and George Harrison playing music for free to the public. Improvised drum circles still form on the weekends where people come together and fill the park with a constant beat for hours on end. The hill played a major part in the hippies' ability to openly use drugs because the police had employed a policy of looking the other way {{when it came to the}} hill.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1960s, some working class skinheads have {{attacked}} hippies.

25|$|The Castro's age {{as a gay}} mecca began {{during the}} late 1960s with the <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love</b> in the {{neighboring}} Haight-Ashbury district in 1967. The two neighborhoods are separated by a large mountain, topped by Buena Vista Park. The hippie and free love movements had fostered communal living and free society ideas including housing of large groups of people in hippie communes. Androgyny became popular with men even in full beards as gay hippie men began {{to move into the}} area. The 1967 gathering brought tens of thousands of middle-class youth from all over the United States to the Haight which saw its own exodus when well-organized individuals and collectives started to see the Castro as an oasis from the massive influx. Many of the hippies had no way to support themselves or places to shelter. The Haight became drug ridden and violent, chasing off the gay population, who looked for a more stable area to live.|$|E
25|$|In the UK and Europe, {{the years}} 1987 to 1989 {{were marked by}} a {{large-scale}} revival of many characteristics of the hippie movement. This later movement, composed mostly of people aged 18 to 25, adopted much of the original hippie philosophy of love, peace and freedom. The summer of 1988 {{became known as the}} Second <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love.</b> Although the music favored by this movement was modern electronic music, especially house music and acid house, one could often hear songs from the original hippie era in the chill out rooms at raves. In the UK, many of the well-known figures of this movement first lived communally in Stroud Green, an area of north London located in Finsbury Park. In 1995, The Sekhmet Hypothesis attempted to link both hippie and rave culture together in relation to transactional analysis, suggesting that rave culture was a social archetype based on the mood of friendly strength, compared to the gentle hippie archetype, based on friendly weakness. The later electronic dance genres known as goa trance and psychedelic trance and its related events and culture have important hippie legacies and neo hippie elements. The popular DJ of the genre Goa Gil, like other hippies from the 1960s, decided to leave the US and Western Europe to travel on the hippie trail and later developing psychedelic parties and music in the Indian island of Goa in which the goa and psytrance genres were born and exported around the world in the 1990s and 2000s.|$|E
