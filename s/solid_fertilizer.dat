In the non-fertilized plots, 70 % of all root tips were ectomycorrhizal and the corresponding figure for fertilized plots was 55 %. At both sites the frequency of one of the eight classified ectomycorrhizal types decreased significantly in all fertilized plots except in the urea treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} {{along the}} soil profile of Eucalyptus globulus root biomass was followed in a plantation in central Portugal at 1, 2 and 6 years after planting, using an excavation technique. The experimental design {{consisted of a}} control (C) and 3 treatments: application of <b>solid</b> <b>fertilizers</b> twice a year (F), irrigation without the application of fertilizers (I) and irrigation combined with liquid fertilizers (IL). Bellow- and above-ground biomass decreased as follows: IL>I>F>C. So, water stress limited growth more severely than nutrient stress. The roots rapidly colonized the top soil volume (0 - 20 cm depth) {{during the first year}} after planting. Fine roots biomass 6 years after planting was 2. 2, 1. 8 and 1. 6 times higher in IL treatment than it was respectively in control, and in F and I treatments. The distribution of fine roots along the soil profile 6 years after planting was more even in IL compared to the other treatments. However, fine roots in the top soil were more concentrated along the tree rows in the irrigated treatments than in the others. The proportion of below-ground biomass relative to the total tree biomass relative to the total tree biomass and the root/shoot ratio were higher in C than in the treatments at early growth stages. This pattern was not so clear 6 years after planting, due to the increased proportion of the tap root relative to total biomass, especially in the IL treatment...|$|R

The use of inorganic fertilizers continuously can caused decreasing the soil fertility and soil organic matters, so if not fixed immediately that land no longer able to produce on the optimum level and sustainable. The solution to overcome this problem is the addition of organic matter. Compost made from banana stems can be an alternative option that can aim to minimized the waste of unused banana stems. Organic materials that do not decompose completely will cause harmful effects. Therefore the government made Peraturan Menteri Pertanian No. 70 /Permentan/SR. 140 / 10 / 2011. The rules drawn up to regulate product quality compost so as to protect consumers and prevent environmental pollution. This study aims to investigate the characteristics of compost made from banana stems. Each parameter will be tested and compared with the minimum technical requirements of <b>solid</b> organic <b>fertilizer</b> contained in Peraturan Menteri Pertanian No. 70 /Permentan/SR. 140 / 10 / 2011. The result showed that compost made from banana stem has a quality that is in accordance with the quality of the minimum technical requirements <b>Solid</b> Organic <b>Fertilizer</b> Permentan Nomor 70 /Permentan/SR. 140 / 10 / 2011 includes parameters C-organic, C / N ratio, pH H 2 O, (N + P 2 O 5 + K 2 O), Fe total, Fe available, Mn total, Zn total, Pb total, Cd total, Microbial contaminants and Microbial Functional (fastening N and Solvents P) ...|$|R
