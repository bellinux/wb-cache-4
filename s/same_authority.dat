5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} {{at least once}} a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it is worth noting that the Council has the <b>same</b> <b>authority</b> and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint, which is an informal discussion group within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E

25|$|In the 4th or 5th century Buddhaghosa Thera {{wrote the}} first Pali commentaries {{to much of the}} Tipitaka (which were based on much older manuscripts, mostly in old Sinhalese). After him many other monks wrote various commentaries, which have become part of the Theravāda heritage. These texts do not have the <b>same</b> <b>authority</b> as the Tipitaka does, though Buddhaghosas Visuddhimagga is a {{cornerstone}} of the commentarial tradition.|$|E
25|$|Cornell University Police {{protect the}} campus and are {{classified}} as peace officers and have the <b>same</b> <b>authority</b> as the Ithaca city police.

The Cornell University Police are on campus and on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Their duties include: patrolling the university around the clock, responding to emergency situations and to non-emergency calls for service, crime prevention services, active investigation of crimes on campus, enforcement of state criminal and motor vehicle laws, and campus regulations.|$|E
25|$|The Dasam Granth is a scripture of Sikhs which {{contains}} texts {{attributed to the}} Guru Gobind Singh. The Dasam Granth is important to {{a great number of}} Sikhs, however it does not have the <b>same</b> <b>authority</b> as the Guru Granth Sahib. Some compositions of the Dasam Granth like Jaap Sahib, (Amrit Savaiye), and Benti Chaupai are part of the daily prayers (Nitnem) for Sikhs. The Dasam Granth is largely versions of Hindu mythology from the Puranas, secular stories {{from a variety of sources}} called Charitro Pakhyan – tales to protect careless men from perils of lust.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{dissolution}} of the Sanhedrin in 358 CE, there has been no universally recognized authority within Halakha. Maimonides (1135–1204) {{was one of the greatest}} scholars of the Middle Ages, and is arguably one of the most widely accepted scholars among the Jewish people since the closing of the Talmud in 500. Influenced by the rationalist school of thought and generally showing a preference for a natural (as opposed to miraculous) redemption for the Jewish people, Maimonides proposed a rationalist solution for achieving the goal of re-establishing the highest court in Jewish tradition and reinvesting it with the <b>same</b> <b>authority</b> it had in former years. There have been several attempts to implement Maimonides' recommendations, the latest being in modern times.|$|E
25|$|The Shias {{accept some}} of the same hadiths used by Sunnis as part of the sunnah to argue their case. In addition, they {{consider}} the sayings of Ahl al-Bayt that are not attributed directly to Muhammad as hadiths. Shias do not accept many Sunni hadiths unless they are also recorded in Shia sources or the methodology can be proven of how they were recorded. Also, some Sunni-accepted hadith are less favored by Shias; one example is that because of Aisha's opposition to Ali, hadiths narrated by Aisha are not given the <b>same</b> <b>authority</b> as those by other companions. Another example is hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah, who is considered by Shias as the enemy of Ali. The Shia argument is that Abu Hurairah was only a Muslim four years of his life before Muhammad's death. Although he accompanied Muhammad for four years only, he managed to record ten times as many hadiths as Abu Bakr and Ali each.|$|E
25|$|After his {{intervention}} in Ireland, Henry II effectively divided the English colony into liberties {{also known as}} lordships. These were effectively county palatines and differed from ordinary counties in that they were disjoined from the crown and that whoever they were granted to essentially had the <b>same</b> <b>authority</b> as the king and that the king's writ had no effect except a writ of error. This covered all land within the county that was not church land. The reasons for the creating of such powerful entities in Ireland {{was due to the}} lack of authority the English crown had there. The same process occurred after the Norman conquest of England where despite there being a strong central government, county palatines were needed in border areas with Wales and Scotland. In Ireland this meant that the land was divided and granted to Richard de Clare and his followers who became lords (and sometimes called earls), with the only land which the English crown had any direct control over being the sea-coast towns and territories immediately adjacent.|$|E

500|$|Bourne also {{suggests}} {{that the use of}} the site as a religious centre might predate the friary. He wrote, [...] "the <b>same</b> <b>authority</b> tells us also, that there was an ancient Religious House founded by the Kings of Northumberland and that several of them were buried here; but it cannot be true that they built any Thing for the St Austin Fryers, for they came not into England 'till long after the Conquest, in the year 1252." ...|$|E
500|$|Pope Gregory XIV (1590–1591) {{began the}} {{practice}} of creating cardinal-nephews whose formal appointment coincided de facto with their nomination, and was thus separate from the ordinal process for creating cardinals, and, when he fell ill, he authorized his cardinal-nephew, Paolo Emilio Sfondrato, to use the Fiat ut petitur, a power which was later diminished {{at the urging of}} the College. Paul V issued a motu proprio on April 30, 1618, formally bestowing on his cardinal-nephew the <b>same</b> <b>authority</b> Pope Clement VIII had given to Pietro Aldobrandini, beginning what historian Laurain-Portemer calls [...] "l'age classique'" [...] of nepotism.|$|E
500|$|Wilson was {{an early}} member of the Massachusetts Bay Company, and {{accompanied}} John Winthrop and the Winthrop Fleet to New England in 1630. [...] As soon as they arrived, he, with Governor Winthrop, Thomas Dudley, and Isaac Johnson, entered into a formal and solemn covenant {{with each other to}} walk together in the fellowship of the gospel. [...] Life was harsh in the new wilderness, and Plymouth historian Nathaniel Morton said that Wilson [...] "bare a great share of the difficulties of these new beginnings with great cheerfulness and alacrity of spirit." [...] Wilson was chosen the pastor of their first church in Charlestown, being installed as teacher there on 27 August 1630, and in the same month the General Court ordered that a dwelling-house should be built for him at the public expense, and the governor and Sir Richard Saltonstall were appointed to put this into effect. [...] By the <b>same</b> <b>authority</b> it was also ordered, that Wilson's salary, until the arrival of his wife, should be 20 pounds a year. [...] After the Charlestown church was established, most of its members moved across the Charles River to Boston, after which services were held alternately {{on each side of the}} river, and then later only in Boston.|$|E
50|$|Critics {{charged that}} {{allowing}} suspects to be detained by the <b>same</b> <b>authorities</b> who interrogated them heightened {{the potential for}} abuse and coercion. The Government countered that cases of persons sent to police detention facilities tended to be those in which the facts were not in dispute. An MOJ regulation permits officials to {{limit the amount of}} documentation related to ongoing court cases retained by prisoners.|$|R

500|$|The crusaders {{decided to}} attack Damascus from the west, where {{orchards}} would {{provide them with}} a constant food supply. They arrived at Daraiya on 23 July, with the army of Jerusalem in the vanguard, followed by Louis and then Conrad in the rearguard. The densely cultivated gardens and orchards would prove to be a serious obstacle for the crusaders. According to William of Tyre, the crusader army was prepared for battle: At Daria , since the city was now so near, the sovereigns drew up their forces in battle formation and assigned the legions to their proper places in the order of march...Because of its supposed familiarity with the country, the division led by the King of Jerusalem was, by common decision of the princes, directed to lead the way and open a path for the legions following.

2500|$|The {{organisation}} {{started out}} as a social movement and only gradually entered the political arena.
