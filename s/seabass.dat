Jay Rayner visited the restaurant whilst {{it was at the}} Bekerley Hotel in 2003 for The Observer. He thought that the menu was over complicated, and not all the elements of the dishes worked together. Gillian Glover of The Scotsman thought in 2005 that some of the food served was forgettable, but stand out elements included frog leg lolipops which came with her main course of baked <b>seabass</b> with garlic puree.|$|E

500|$|Victor Lewis-Smith {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Guardian in 2005, {{thought that a}} spring onion risotto accompaniment to a pan fried <b>seabass</b> tasted so good {{that it would have}} been sufficient as a main course itself and was also quite pleased that crêpe suzette was served on a trolley for table side service. Claire Ogden visited the restaurant for the Metro newspaper shortly after it was first awarded a Michelin star in 2007. She thought that a John Dory main course was [...] "pristine", and overall thought that the star was well deserved. The only negative thing she had to say about the experience was a toffee foam served on top of a pear granita which she described as [...] "flimsy-flavoured". It was named the best restaurant in Britain by Les Routiers later that year. The critic from the Western Mail stated in 2008 that [...] "the menu is short and to the point, with around five choices for each course. The wine list is huge, an insurmountable challenge for me but another's utopia." [...] However, he remarked that the main course was [...] "genuinely brilliant food" [...] and deserving of its Michelin star.|$|E
2500|$|Through social learning, fishes {{might learn}} not only {{where to get}} food, but also what to get {{and how to get}} it. Hatchery-raised salmon can be taught to quickly accept novel, live prey items similar to those they will {{encounter}} once they will be released in the wild, simply by watching an experienced salmon take such prey. [...] The same is true of young perch.

50|$|In {{the place}} where the river flows into the sea, there has been formed over the years an {{extended}} Delta of 4.000 hectares, because of the large dam that was constructed and retains much of the brought matters. As a result, silting has benn greatly reduced and during the summer, when there is no much water, the sea enters and largely overwhelms the river bed. Flathead mullets and European <b>seabasses</b> are found in Haliakmon's Delta. In the shallow marine areas formed there, the fry of many Aegean Sea's fish finds a place to reproduce, while about 90% of Greece's mussels are produced in the Haliakmon-Axios(Vardar) Delta. Aliki Kitrous is an area of 254 hectares, where 15-20.000 tons of salt are produced per year.|$|R
40|$|Teleost fishes exhibit an unrivaled {{diversity}} of reproductive patterns {{compared to other}} vertebrates, and the groupers (Epinephelidae) and <b>seabasses</b> (Serranidae) represent an extreme example of this diversity, because significant variations in sexual pattern, mating behavior, and reproductive anatomy occur among species in both families. For this research, I investigate these three aspects of the reproductive biology in five species of groupers from the eastern Pacific. I then combine my data with published results on the reproductive biology of other groupers and <b>seabasses</b> to describe taxonomic differences in these aspects and reconstruct their evolutionary history. Finally, I use a comparative phylogenetic approach to evaluate the evolutionary relationship between mating system characteristics (i. e., mating group structure and sperm competition) and sexual pattern. More specifically, I test whether evolutionary shifts in sexual pattern and, in particular the loss of sex change, were influenced by changes from paired to group spawning and associated increases in sperm competition among males. These analyses allow me to determine whether predictions of sex-allocation theory regarding the influence of mating behavior on sex allocation are congruent with fine-scale, evolutionary patterns of sex change within a resolved phylogeny. My results indicate that characteristics of the sexual pattern, mating behavior, and reproductive anatomy in both families are exceptionally labile. Evolutionary transformations in these features do not strictly follow taxonomic lines and remarkable changes have evolved in closely related species and genera. The most parsimonious phylogenetic reconstructions of the evolutionary history of sexual patterns indicate that protogynous hermaphroditism is the ancestral character state in both the Epinephelidae and the Serranidae, {{and other forms of}} hermaphroditism evolved secondarily from this state. Tests of correlated evolution showed that evolutionary transformations in sexual pattern from protogyny to gonochorism are correlated with transformations in mating group structure from paired to group spawning, and sperm competition is significantly higher in gonochoric species than protogynous species. These results suggest that the loss of sex change was influenced by changes from paired to group spawning and associated increases in sperm competition among males. More importantly, this research provides phylogenetic support for predictions of the size- advantage model and empirical evidence for the influence of sperm competition on sex allocation in animal...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis Mating {{behavior}} in simultaneously hermaphroditic <b>seabasses</b> has been {{often cited as}} an example of cooperation among unrelated conspecifics. The predominant mating {{behavior in}} this group involves egg trading, where individuals reciprocally fertilize parcels of eggs from a partner. Egg trading has been suggested as a good example of a tit-for-tat cooperative mating strategy. Although simultaneous hermaphroditic fishes are often held up as strong examples of coop-eration in mating behavior, a closer examination reveals significant sexual selection and sexual conflict between male and female roles among individuals. In the 7 species where data exist, there is a significant increase in male reproductive success with individual size, and in all but 1 species success through male function increases faster than reproductive success through female function. Despite this male-size advantage in simultaneous hermaphrodites, most species maintain their hermaph-roditism for their entire life, and the increased male allocation while engaging in biased forms of reciprocation appear to increase the evolutionary stability of hermaphroditism in these species. Thus, egg-trading behavior is probably more com-plicated than was initially recognized, with individuals releasing different numbers of eggs in spawns, spawning at different rates as males and females, and partitioning male effort between pair and alternative mating tactics. The departures from equal reciprocity can probably be best understood by including aspects of traditional mating-system theory, with individuals increasing male mating success through a variety of behavioral tactics...|$|R

5000|$|White <b>seabass</b> are fished {{primarily}} with live bait in relatively shallow water, {{but they will}} also take a fast-trolled spoon, artificial squid or bone jig. Live squid {{appear to be the}} best bait for a white <b>seabass,</b> but large anchovies and medium-size sardines are also good. At times, large white <b>seabass</b> will bite only on fairly large, live Pacific mackerel. The young of this species are exceptionally vulnerable to sport anglers for two reasons: The first is that as juveniles they inhabit shallow nearshore areas, bays, and estuaries, and the second is that they are not easily recognized as white <b>seabass</b> by the average angler. Commonly, these young fish are mistakenly called [...] "sea trout" [...] because of their sleek profile and vertical bars or [...] "parr marks". To add to the confusion, these bars fade as the fish grows.|$|E

50|$|The body of {{the white}} <b>seabass</b> is elongate, and {{somewhat}} compressed. The head is pointed and slightly compressed. The mouth is large, with a row of small teeth in the roof; the lower jaw slightly projects. The color is bluish to gray above, with dark speckling, becoming silver below. The young have several dark vertical bars. The white <b>seabass</b> {{is closely related to}} the California corbina, but is the only California member of the croaker family to exceed 20 pounds in weight.
