5|$|Each {{side has}} {{two sets of}} street stairs, with the {{full-time}} entrance at Grand Avenue and Broadway on the west end. There are two additional <b>staircases</b> by the crossovers; however, these are closed at night. HEET access {{at both ends of}} the mezzanine allow people to exit fare control without having to walk down to the middle of the mezzanine. Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which is clear from the presence of two closed <b>staircases</b> at the Manhattan-bound side. The mezzanine narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern side of the mezzanine directly to the opposite of the closed <b>staircases.</b> The narrowing of the mezzanine did not allow for <b>staircases</b> on the Queens-bound side in this location like on the Manhattan-bound side. Chain-link fence is used to separate the area inside and outside fare control. In total, this side of the station has four <b>staircases</b> in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other side has five <b>staircases.</b>|$|E
5|$|The station's {{full-length}} mezzanine allows crossover {{from any}} of the station's four <b>staircases</b> from each platform, with a total of eight <b>staircases</b> from the mezzanine to platform level. There is no direct indoor access to the Queens Center Mall's entrance at the northwest corner of Queens Boulevard and 59th Avenue from the mezzanine.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} entrance hall, {{reception and}} family bedrooms {{were placed on}} the first floor above a low semi-basement containing service rooms. The two principal entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external <b>staircases,</b> originally a single broad flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south. These <b>staircases</b> have since been replaced by simpler designs.|$|E
40|$|We propose two {{variants}} of <b>staircase</b> codes that {{resolve the issue}} of parity-propagation in their encoding process. The proposed codes provide a systematic way of terminating a <b>staircase</b> code after an arbitrary number of blocks. The class of feed-forward <b>staircase</b> codes are introduced, which uses a self-protection technique to avoid parity-propagation. We also introduce the class of partial feed-forward <b>staircase</b> codes, which allows parity-propagation to occur over a given number of blocks. By amortizing the complexity of self-protection over several standard <b>staircase</b> blocks, the encoding complexity of these codes is made comparable to <b>staircase</b> codes. Partial feed-forward <b>staircase</b> codes have the same error-floor as <b>staircase</b> codes. Simulations confirm that {{the performance of the}} proposed codes in both the waterfall and error-floor regions is similar to the original <b>staircase</b> codes. The proposed codes help extend the domain of application of <b>staircase</b> codes to systems in which parity-propagation is undesirable or termination is necessary.

5|$|Congregational {{worship in}} Borobudur is {{performed}} in a walking pilgrimage. Pilgrims are guided by the system of <b>staircases</b> and corridors ascending to the top platform. Each platform represents one stage of enlightenment. The path that guides pilgrims was designed to symbolize Buddhist cosmology.|$|E
5|$|External <b>staircases.</b> Most villas and palazzi were {{designed}} for formal entrance by a carriage through an archway in the street façade, leading to a courtyard within. An intricate double staircase would lead from the courtyard to the piano nobile. This would be the palazzo's principal entrance to the first-floor reception rooms; the symmetrical flights of steps would turn inwards and outwards {{as many as four}} times. Owing to the topography of their elevated sites it was often necessary to approach churches by many steps; these steps were often transformed into long straight marble <b>staircases,</b> in themselves decorative architectural features (illustration 19), in the manner of the Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{full-time}} side at {{the west}} end of the mezzanine has three street stairs. One leads to the northeast corner of Queens Boulevard and 59th Avenue, the closest to the mall. The other two <b>staircases</b> are through a long passageway to both southern corners of Queens Boulevard and Woodhaven Boulevard, acting as a pedestrian underpass outside of fare control. These <b>staircases</b> date back to the station's original opening. There is an entrance to the southeast corner of Woodhaven and Queens Boulevards that, {{as a result of the}} construction of the Long Island Expressway in the mid-1950s, leads only to two entrance ramps to the expressway, with no continuous sidewalk leading to the entrance.|$|E
50|$|One {{outstanding}} {{feature of}} the interior is the <b>staircase,</b> a fascinating alteration which has been dated to the late 18th century. The concept of the <b>staircase</b> was to gain more room where the original <b>staircase</b> had been, thus creating a feeling of greater space in the hallway. The <b>staircase</b> has a delicate metal handrail and runs through both storeys along three sides of an open well. The <b>staircase</b> rests on two beautiful fluted columns. There is light Neo-Elizabethan plaster work {{on the underside of}} the <b>staircase.</b>|$|R

50|$|The piece de {{resistance}} {{of the house is}} arguably the <b>staircase,</b> a nice alteration which can be dated to the late 18th century. The concept of the <b>staircase</b> was to gain more room where the original <b>staircase</b> had been whilst giving more perceived spaciousness. The <b>staircase</b> has a delicate metal handrail and runs through both storeys along three sides of an open well. The clever structure of the <b>staircase</b> {{is that it is not}} attached along the back wall of the hall but leaves a space there and flies upward independently of the back wall. The <b>staircase</b> rests on two beautiful fluted columns. There is light Neo-Elizabethan plaster work on the underside of the <b>staircase.</b>|$|R
5|$|Additional common {{features}} {{are shared by}} the palaces of Pylos, Mycenae and Tiryns; a large court with colonnades lies {{directly in front of}} the central megaron, while a second, but smaller, megaron is also found inside these structures. The <b>staircases</b> in the palace of Pylos indicate that the palaces had two stories. The private quarters of the members of the royal family were presumably located on the second floor.|$|E
5|$|An {{interior}} rearrangement {{was completed}} around 1942. The women's {{room for the}} main waiting room was moved from the east side to the west side, with one bay added to the west wing. A new dining area was constructed, occupying one-third of the waiting room, with its kitchen occupying the former bathroom space. The lunch cafe and <b>staircases</b> were also modified.|$|E
5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. The second floor landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the second floor landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two <b>staircases.</b> Both <b>staircases</b> rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E

5|$|North Parade Bridge {{was built}} almost 100 {{years later in}} 1836 by William Tierney Clark. His {{original}} bridge was made of cast iron on stone abutments, with lodges and <b>staircases.</b> This was rebuilt in 1936 completely in stone. Many of the buildings in South Parade are now hotels and restaurants whilst some remain as private residences. The area which Wood envisaged as an area of sunken gardens matching the houses is now a car park.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} <b>staircase</b> separator, {{introduced}} in [2], greatly facilitates {{the design of}} divide-and-conquer algorithms for problems on rectangles. We generalize the concept of <b>staircase</b> separator to k-perfect <b>staircase</b> separator, namely a set of <b>staircase</b> separators which partitions a set S of n axis-parallel, disjoint rectangles into k subsets of (almost) equal size. We derive an optimal O(log n) time parallel algorithm for computing a k-perfect <b>staircase</b> separator, using O(n) processors on the CREW PRAM model of computation. For a special case, where k = 2, this result provides a new bound of d n 2 e, in compared to d 7 n 8 e in [2], {{on the quality of}} <b>staircase</b> separators for sets of rectangles. 1 Introduction In this paper we consider the problem of computing a <b>staircase</b> separator for a set S of n axis-parallel, disjoint rectangles in the plane.
