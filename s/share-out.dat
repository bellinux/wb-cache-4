60|$|I can {{conceive}} no such Peace Congress {{as those}} that have settled up after other wars, settling up after this war. Not only has the war been enormously bigger than any other war, but it has struck deeper at the foundations {{of social and economic}} life. I doubt if we begin to realize how much of the old system is dead to-day, how much has to be remade. Since the beginnings of history there has been a credible promise of gold payments underneath our financial arrangements. It is now an incredible promise. The value of a pound note waves about while you look at it. What will happen to it when peace comes no man can tell. Nor {{what will happen to the}} mark. The rouble has gone into the Abyss. Our giddy money specialists clutch their handfuls of paper and watch it flying down the steep. Much as we may hate the Germans, some of us will have to sit down with some of the enemy to arrange a common scheme for the preservation of credit in money. And I presume that it is not proposed to end this war in a wild scramble of buyers for such food as remains in the world. There is a shortage now, a greater shortage ahead of the world, and there will be shortages of supply at the source and transport in food and all raw materials for some years to come. The Peace Congress will have to sit and organize a <b>share-out</b> and distribution and reorganization of these shattered supplies. It will have to Rhondda the nations. Probably, too, we shall have to deal collectively with a pestilence before we are out of the mess. Then there are such little jobs as the reconstruction of Belgium and Serbia. There are considerable rectifications of boundaries to be made. There are fresh states to be created, in Poland and Armenia for example. About all these smaller states, new and old, that the peace must call into being, there must be a system of guarantees of the most difficult and complicated sort.|$|E

In eastern Brittany {{in the ninth}} century {{there is plenty of}} evidence that two degrees of kinship (the descendants of a common grandfather) were often involved in the transmission of landed property. Siblings and cousins, however, might argue over use of the family land and sometimes a <b>share-out</b> ensued. Further, the small number of cases of sales from husbands to wives seem to have taken place to secure free powers of alienation. Permanent division of the family land became more common {{over the course of the}} ninth century and it looks as if family control of family units was fragmenting. Religious pressure to bring freely alienable land on to the market was one major force contributing to the change, but there appear to have been political pressures at work too. Davies Wendy.

The usage of internet leads to accessing the immense amount of data. Data may be unstructured data, structure data, and semi-structured data. So we are storing and processing such vast amount of data having gigantic complexity.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{two aspects}} {{of the behavior of}} interior reinforced concrete waffle flat plate?column connections under lateral loads: the share of the unbalanced moment between flexure and excentric shear, and the effect of the transverse beams. A non-linear finite element model (benchmark model) was developed and calibrated with the results of quasi-static cyclic tests conducted on a 3 / 5 scale specimen. First, from this numerical model, the portion cv of the unbalanced moment transferred by the excentricity of shear about the centroid of the critical sections defined by Eurocode 2 (EC- 2) and by ACI 318 - 11 was calculated and compared with the <b>share-out</b> prescribed by these codes. It is found that while the critical section of EC- 2 is consistent with the cv provided by this code, in the case of ACI 318 - 11, the value assigned to cv is far below (about 50 % smaller) the actual one obtained with the numerical simulations. Second, from the benchmark model, seven additional models were developed by varying the depth D of the transverse beam over the thickness h of the plate. It was found that the ductility of the connection and the effective width of the plate can respectively be increased up to 50 % and 10 % by raising D/h to 2 and 1. 5...|$|E
40|$|Resumo: Trata-se de estudo teórico sobre o poder nas organizações, sendo estas consideradas como sistemas políticos que apresentam sempre três dimensões diferenciadas, porém imanentes que são a autoridade/ordem, a disciplina/controle e a cooperação/consenso. Entende-se a gestão como um processo que tem que dar conta destas três dimensões, privilegiando uma ou mais delas, de acordo com o contexto organizacional. O objetivo é, portanto, contribuir para uma reflexão sobre os aspectos políticos dos saberes e práticas de gestão, aprofundando uma leitura das relações de poder nas organizações. A metodologia desenvolveu-se em três grandes etapas. Na primeira, foi feito o esforço de construir a categoria analítica poder a partir de quatro autores Max Weber, Ta 1 colt Parsons, Michel Foucault e Hannah Arendt, uma opção orientada inicialmente, pela freqüente utilização destes autores na {{literatura}} contemporânea. Para uma melhor definição do poder, este foi caracterizado nos seus "correlatos" de disputa de interesses, mecanismos de controle e conflito, sempre utilizando os quatro autores de referência. Na segunda etapa, foi realizada uma (re) leitura da produção teórica da TGA (Teoria Geral da Administração). O estudo discutiu inicialmente uma caracterização geral das abordagens teóricas, também conhecidas como escolas ou correntes da TGA e o seu desenvolvimento histórico social. A análise do poder nestas abordagens revelou que a dimensão autoridade/ordem é dada como inquestionável, a de disciplina/controle é sistematicamente ocultada ou dissimulada sob um discurso altamente ideologizado e a dimensão cooperação/consenso para a maioria das abordagens, com valorização do enfoque de cooperação/consenso, com particular ênfase na confluência de interesses dos trabalhadores com os da organização, é a mais presente, com exceção dos autores "estruturalistas" que consideram os conflitos como constitutivos das organizações. A TGA pode ser vista, então, como um campo com forte componente ideológico, cujo enfoque privilegiado é a visão sistêmico-funcionalista das organizações, sendo os autores de referência privilegiados para esta discussão Max Weber e Talcolt Parsons, tendo-se Michel Foucault como um recurso para uma leitura da disciplina nas entrelinhas. Finalmente, foi realizada uma leitura da produção teórica de alguns autores que se ocupam da gestão na área da saúde, com maior ênfase naqueles ligados ao Departamento de Medicina Preventiva e Social da Universidade de Campinas/SP (Brasil), onde esta investigação foi desenvolvida. Em relação a estes autores, observou-se o reconhecimento explícito da importância do poder para o processo de gestão em saúde, sendo que a dimensão cooperação/consenso, em coincidência com os autores da TGA, é a mais privilegiada. Esta dimensão é sempre pensada na perspectiva da obtenção da adesão dos trabalhadores para o ideário da construção do sistema único de saúde no país, ou seja, a busca da convergência de interesses entre sujeitos e organização. Também como nos autores da TGA, a dimensão autoridade/ordem é dada como não problemática, na medida em que a gestão em saúde dar-se-ia em organizações governamentais consideradas legítimas porque respaldadas no processo eleitoral, seria parte de um sistema político formal. A dimensão disciplina/controle é admitida, mas pouco explorada, embora reconheçam as organizações de saúde como espaços de disputa de interesses e de conflitos. Com isto, é possível uma leitura tanto pelo referencial parsoniano, de um lado, quando as organizações são tomadas como sistemas cooperativos e com elevado compartilhamento de valores, como pelo ideal arendtiano, de outro, no aspecto da construção de um projeto político em espaços mais colegiados de direção. Como conclusão mais geral, este estudo permite afirmar que, embora sendo apenas uma das muitas possibilidades neste campo, os autores adotados - Weber, Parsons, Arendt e Foucault - puderam contribuir para iluminar, em graus diferentes, cada uma das três dimensões imanentes das organizações, o que provavelmente justifique o uso recorrente de suas concepções, de forma isolada ou combinada, em estudos contemporâneos que tomam como central, o tema poder nas organizações;;Abstract:It is on {{the theoretical}} study about the power in the organizations, being these ones considered as political systems that always present three differentiated dimensions, however immanent that plows the authority/order, the discipline/control 'and the cooperation/consensus. One understands the administration as a process that has to cover these three dimensions, privileging {{one or more of}} them, according to the organizational contexto The objective is, therefore, to contribute for a reflection on the political aspects of the knowledge?s and administration practices, deepening a reading of the relationships of power in the organizations. The methodology grew in three great stages. In the first, it was made the effort of building the analytic category of the power starting from four authors Max Weber, Talcolt Parsons, Michel Foucault and Hannah Arendt, an option guided initially, for these authors' ftequent use in the contemporary literature. It goes the better definition of the power, this was characterized in the "co-reports" of disputes of interests, control mechanisms and conflict, always using the four reference authors. In the second stage, a new reading of the theoretical production of TGA (General Theory of the Administration) was made. First of alI, the study discussed a general characterization of the theoretical approaches, also known as schools or currents of TGA and its social historical development. The analysis of the power in these approaches revealed that the dimension authority/order is given as unquestionable, the one of discipline/control is hidden systematically or dissembled under a highly ideologized speech and the dimension cooperation/consensus for most of the approaches, with valorization of the cooperation/consensus focus, with special emphasis in the confluence of the workers' interests with the ones of the organization, it is the most present one, except for the authors "structuralists" that consider the conflicts as constituents of the organizations. TGA can, thus, be seen as a field with a strong ideological component, whose privileged focus is the systemic/functionalist vision ofthe organizations, being the reference authors privileged for this discussion Max Weber and Talcolt Parsons, having Michel Foucault as a resource for a reading of the discipline in the implied sense. Finally, a reading was accomplished of the theoretical production of some authors in charge of the administration in the Health area, with larger emphasis in those linked to the Department of Preventive and Social Medicine of the University of Campinas/SP (Brazil), where this investigation was developed. In relation to these authors, the explicit recognition {{of the importance of the}} power was observed for the administration process health, and the dimension cooperation/consensus, in coincidence with the authors of TGA, is the most privileged. This dimension is always thought in the perspective of obtaining the workers' adhesion for the idea range of the construction of the unique system of health in the country, in other words, the search of the convergence of interests between subjects and organization. Also, as in the authors of TGA, the dimension authority/order is given as non-problematic, as the administration in health would happen in government organizations, considered as legitimate because they were backed in the electoral process, it would be part of a formal political system. The dimension discipline/control is admitted, but little explored, although they recognize the organizations of health as spaces of dispute of interests and conflicts. With this, a reading is possible as for the parsonian referential on a hand, when the organizations are taken as cooperative systems and with high <b>share-out</b> of values, as for the arendtian ideal on the other hand, in the aspect of the construction of a political project in spaces with more collegiate of direction. As a more general conclusion, this study allows to affirm that, although being just one of many possibilities in this field, the adopted authors Weber, Parsons, Arendt and Foucault - they could contribute to light up, in different degrees, each one ofthe three immanent dimensions ofthe organizations, which probably justifies the appealing use of their conceptions, in a isolated or combined way in contemporary studies that take as central, the theme about the power in the organization...|$|E
