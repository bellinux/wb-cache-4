25|$|Abutting the {{northern}} {{side of the}} tower is the rectangular rear podium, which stretches {{the width of the}} building and comprises four levels (G, B1, B2, and B3) and a roof top deck (L1). The side elevations are pale yellow facebrick in <b>stretcher</b> <b>bond</b> with rhythmically placed square windows. The northern elevation has an egg crate of white-painted, concrete sun hoods sheltering large, aluminium-framed windows. The windows have spandrel panels featuring dark slates.|$|E
50|$|Paterson House is a two-storeyed painted masonry {{building}} with a complex corrugated iron roof consisting of intersecting gables with turrets and hipped bays.

25|$|It is the {{simplest}} repeating pattern, and {{will create a}} wall only one-half brick thick. Such a thin wall is not stable enough to stand alone, and must be tied to a supporting structure. This practice is common in modern buildings, where <b>stretcher</b> <b>bonded</b> brickwork may be the outer face of a cavity wall, or the facing to a timber or steel-framed structure.|$|R
50|$|The entire {{concrete}} structure {{is covered with}} a facing of blocks in imitation of <b>stretcher</b> and header <b>bond</b> masonry.|$|R
25|$|The front portico is a {{rectangular}} block {{attached to the}} tower that, on approach, gives {{the impression of a}} grand colonnade across the width of a tall ground floor. This is formed by a rhythmic series of white, smooth-rendered, rectangular concrete columns topped by a low parapet. This is in-filled with large panels of dark aluminium-framed inoperable glazing. The main elevation is symmetrical except for the entrance doors, which are placed off-centre. The windowless side elevations (east and west) of the portico are pale yellow facebrick walls in <b>stretcher</b> <b>bond.</b> The portico has a concealed flat roof clad with metal rib and pan sheeting.|$|E
25|$|The {{thickness}} specified for a wall {{is determined}} by such factors as damp proofing considerations, {{whether or not the}} wall has a cavity, load-bearing requirements, expense, and the era during which the architect was or is working. Wall thickness specification has proven considerably various, and while some non-load-bearing brick walls may be as little as half a brick thick, or even less when shiners are laid <b>stretcher</b> <b>bond</b> in partition walls, others brick walls are much thicker. The Monadnock Building in Chicago, for example, is a very tall masonry building, and has load-bearing brick walls nearly two metres thick at the base. The majority of brick walls are however usually between one and three bricks thick. At these more modest wall thicknesses, distinct patterns have emerged allowing for a structurally sound layout of bricks internal to each particular specified thickness of wall.|$|E
2500|$|The {{church is}} built of red brick in a <b>stretcher</b> <b>bond</b> pattern. [...] The roofs are of slate. [...] The nave has six bays and {{north and south}} aisles; the latter has three side chapels, {{and there is also}} a Lady chapel with a round roof and two lancet windows. [...] The chancel and apse have a similar roof design. [...] A presbytery adjoins the northeastern side, and at the {{opposite}} corner is the building's landmark—a tall campanile with bell-chamber and copper roof. [...] The entrance, flanked by pilasters, is at the west end below a rose window. [...] Described as [...] "startling" [...] by English Heritage for its similarity to an Italian-style basilica, the church is also considered to have an impressive interior; there is much use of marble in various colours, and a barrel-vaulted ceiling.|$|E
40|$|Today, {{there are}} many types of masonry units that are {{available}} in the market which varies in shapes and sizes. Clay bricks are the most widely used masonry units for construct brick wall in construction industry. In developing construction industry, many alternative materials had used to replace the clay brick, such as foam concrete brick. A study to determine the compressive strength of foam concrete brick wall due to uniform distribution load by using <b>Stretcher</b> and Flemish <b>bond</b> was done. Various sets of wall panels using <b>Stretcher</b> and Flemish <b>bond</b> were made and have same dimension based on bonding type. In this research, the brick size used is based on standard dimension by British Standard which is 215 x 100 x 65 mm. The wall panels were tested to obtain the necessary information. Laboratory testing was done to obtain the compressive strength of wall panel for <b>Stretcher</b> and Flemish <b>bond</b> by using compressive strength test. The value of deflection and strain also obtained from the testing. Percentage of water absorption for foam concrete brick is determined by using water absorption test. Observation also was made during the test to evaluate the failure occurred to the wall panel under compression. From the observation made during the testing, the general failure mode occurred on the wall panel sample are obtained. The result indicated from the test and analysis had determined the compressive strength of wall panel sample, deflection, and strain for <b>Stretcher</b> and Flemish <b>bonding...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{rehabilitation}} of existing masonry elements through jacketing of columns using composite materials {{is becoming a}} remarkable technique in several applications that aim to increase the strength of existing masonry building. An experimental campaign was conducted with Steel- and -Basalt Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) systems, {{in order to test}} new products that might increase the advantages in terms of good adhesion to masonry substrate, breathability of the system, efficiency in aggressive environments, ease of installation and reversibility, which are essential for the preservation of historical buildings. The mean objective of this experimental study was to investigate the state of the improvement of square masonry columns, built in alternate <b>stretcher</b> and header <b>bond</b> configuration using as material confinement Steel- and-Basalt FRCM system, subjected to axial compression. Moreover, the effectiveness and influence of the confinement in terms of load-bearing capacity and strain distribution with respect to unconfined prisms was carried out. An optical technique, known as Digital Image Correlation (DIC), was employed to understand the interaction between the unit masonry components...|$|R
50|$|The walls {{consist of}} two faces of {{brickwork}} between {{which is a}} rubble core matrix. The bonding of the brickwork is characteristic of a late medieval date. Irregular shaped bricks are laid in a fairly thick mortar and in a haphazard bond consisting largely of rows of stretchers with the occasional header used to bond the two wall surfaces together. This construction pre-dated the widespread adoption of English Bond (alternating courses of headers and <b>stretchers)</b> and Flemish <b>Bond</b> (alternating headers and stretchers in each course) in England. The courses of brickwork are bonded together with a lime-based 'common mortar' which was originally pointed back flush with the wall face. It survives on the bedding planes and is exposed in several places on the north elevation. In the kitchen a doorway between the Guildhall which would now lead {{to the back of}} Blackfriars Theatre was blocked and may tentatively be dated to the post-Reformation period (mid sixteenth century) on functional grounds. It reflects a change in the provision of access into {{and the use of the}} ground floor which may relate to the adaptation of the building after the suppression of the religious guild of St. Marys. It is thought that this doorway allowed access for the beadsmen or perhaps was access between the Guildhall and the kitchens of Blackfriars prior to the kitchens being established in the Guildhall.|$|R
2500|$|The {{exterior}} {{walls of}} the house are built from a dull red brick that was locally made. [...] The bricks are laid in a <b>stretcher</b> <b>bond</b> pattern, with belt courses of brownstone above the foundation and at each floor level. [...] The windows on the house, all sixty-four of them, feature brownstone headers and windowsills. [...] Most of them, except for those under the original first floor porches and in the kitchen building, feature round or segmental arches. [...] Brick panels are inserted below the windowsills of the parlor, sitting room, and all twelve of the fourth-floor tower windows. [...] The tower features a bracketed balcony at the second floor level, with a metal canopy roof. [...] This type of balcony was a signature of Upjohn's Italian villa style. [...] The roof is a low-pitched hipped and truncated structure with wide eaves. [...] The eaves have an overhang of three feet and are decorated by flat wooden brackets. [...] Two skylights, original to the house, are mounted on the flat portion of the roof. [...] The roof also features four brick chimneys, capped with brownstone and serving twelve fireplaces.|$|E
2500|$|Moulsecoomb Place is {{the only}} {{building}} in the Moulsecoomb area mentioned by Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner in the Sussex edition of their Buildings of England architectural guides. [...] They describe it as [...] "an early 19th-century seven-bay house of yellow brick", and note that the hall house attached to the rear is [...] "the only worthwhile timber-framed cottage in Brighton". [...] The seven-bay façade, which faces east, is the original part dating from 1790; another two-window range was added {{on the south side}} in the early 20th century, making the composition asymmetrical. [...] The original section has yellow brickwork in a Flemish bond pattern to the main elevation and brown and yellow gauged brickwork on the north (side) wall. [...] Yellow bricks are also used on the south extension, but in a <b>stretcher</b> <b>bond</b> layout. [...] The 1790 section has a 2–3–2 bay pattern whose central three-bay section projects slightly and is set beneath a pediment. [...] Its tympanum has a pattern of raised brickwork. [...] Behind the pediment is a parapet and a cornice with mutules below. [...] Some of the ground-floor windows have elements of the Palladian and Neoclassical Adam styles; those at first-floor level are straight-headed. [...] The hipped roof has several chimney-stacks. [...] The early 20th-century extension is in complementary style. [...] On the east elevation, a single-storey two-window section projects forward and is topped with a parapet and cornice. [...] This continues round to the south elevation, which has a full-height bow front with a three-window range. [...] A modern conservatory has been added to one side.|$|E
