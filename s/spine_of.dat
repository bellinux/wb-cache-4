5|$|The {{skull of}} the Acrocanthosaurus atokensis holotype shows light exostotic {{material}} on the squamosal. The neural <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the eleventh vertebra was fractured and healed while the neural <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> its third tail vertebra had an unusual hook-like structure.|$|E
5|$|It {{is crucial}} for these {{definitions}} that edges are only allowed to stay within a single page of the book. As Atneosen already observed, if edges may instead pass from one page to another across the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the book, then every graph may be embedded into a three-page book. For such a three-page topological book embedding in which spine crossings are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a logarithmic number of spine crossings per edge, and some graphs need this many spine crossings.|$|E
5|$|Testing the {{existence}} of a three-page book embedding of a graph, given a fixed ordering of the vertices along the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the embedding, has unknown computational complexity: it is neither known to be solvable in polynomial time nor known to be NP-hard. And, although every planar graph has book thickness at most four, it is unknown whether there exists a planar graph whose book thickness is exactly four.|$|E

5|$|It was {{powered by}} two {{turbofan}} engines with each {{in a separate}} engine nacelle with S-ducts, to shield engine axial compressors from radar waves, {{on either side of}} the aircraft's <b>spine.</b> <b>Of</b> the two aircraft built, the first YF-23 (PAV-1) was fitted with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines, while the second (PAV-2) was powered by General Electric YF120 engines. The aircraft featured fixed engine nozzles, instead of thrust vectoring nozzles as on the YF-22. As on the B-2, the exhaust from the YF-23's engines flowed through troughs lined with heat-ablating tiles to dissipate heat and shield the engines from infrared homing (IR) missile detection from below.|$|E

5|$|More {{active at}} night {{than during the}} day when it is usually buried in sediment, the bluntnose {{stingray}} is a predator of small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. This species is aplacental viviparous, in which the unborn young are nourished initially by yolk, and later histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by their mother. Females give birth to 1–6 pups every May after a gestation period of 11–12 months, most of which consists of a period of arrested embryonic development. The venomous tail <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the bluntnose stingray is potentially dangerous to unwary beachgoers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as it is widely distributed, common, and minimally threatened by commercial fisheries.|$|E
5|$|As {{the size}} of the AEF grew, the {{division}} was placed under command of I Corps in July. When the Aisne-Marne campaign began shortly thereafter, the division, under I Corps was placed under command of the French Sixth Army protecting its east flank. When the offensive began, the division advanced up the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the Marne salient for several weeks, pushing through Belleau Wood, moving 10 miles from 18 to 25 July. On 12 August it was pulled from the lines near Toul to prepare for the next offensive. The division was then a part of the offensive at St. Mihiel, during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel. The division then moved in position for the last major offensive of the war, at Meuse-Argonne. This campaign was the last of the war, as an armistice was signed shortly thereafter. During World War I the 26th Division spent 210 days in combat, and suffered 1,587 killed in action and 12,077 wounded in action. The division returned to the United States and was demobilized on 3 May 1919 at Camp Devens, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|At the marshal's signal, silence descended {{over the}} field and both knights spurred their horses and charged, their lances each {{striking}} the other's shield but not causing significant damage. Wheeling, both again struck but failed to penetrate, scoring glancing blows on their helmets but remaining horsed. For a third time they turned and charged and again they both struck. This time however the lances shattered, sending slivers of wood cartwheeling across the arena and nearly unseating both men. Regaining balance, the knights closed on one another with battle axes drawn, trading furious two-handed blows. As the engagement progressed, Le Gris' superior strength began to tell and Carrouges was driven back until with a mighty swing, Le Gris' axe severed the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> Carrouges' horse. The dying beast tumbled to the ground, Carrouges leaping clear and meeting Le Gris' charge with a side-step, allowing him to thrust his own axe's pike deep into the stomach of Le Gris' steed.|$|E

5|$|Often found {{lying on}} the bottom buried in sediment, the roughtail {{stingray}} is a generalist predator that feeds {{on a variety of}} benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the embryos receiving nourishment initially from yolk, and later from histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. In the northwestern Atlantic, females bear an annual litter of 4–6 young in fall and early winter, after a gestation period of 9–11 months. By contrast, in the Mediterranean there is evidence that females bear two litters of 2–6 young per year after a gestation period of only four months. Rays in the northwestern Atlantic are also larger at birth and at sexual maturity than those from the Mediterranean. The venomous tail <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the roughtail stingray is potentially dangerous to humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern overall and in the northwestern Atlantic, where it is not commercially utilized. However, in the Mediterranean and southwestern Atlantic it is subject to heavy fishing pressure and has been assessed as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|The Moro River {{runs from}} the central {{mountain}} <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> Italy to the Adriatic coast south of Ortona. The German defences on the Moro were a centerpiece of the Winter Line, which guarded {{the eastern side of}} the Apennines along Route 5. Montgomery hoped to punch through the Winter Line, capture Ortona and Pescara and advance to Rome. The British 78th Infantry Division, which had been spearheading V Corps since the Volturno Line actions and had sustained over 7,000 casualties in less than six months, was relieved by the fresh 1st Canadian Infantry Division (Major-General Christopher Vokes), ready to renew the offensive on 5 December 1943. The 78th Infantry Division was sent into the mountains on the relatively quiet left wing of the army, joining the British 5th Infantry Division (Major-General Gerard Bucknall) under XIII Corps.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom {{ruled by}} Kenneth's descendants—older works used the name House of Alpin to {{describe}} them but descent from Kenneth was the defining factor, Irish sources referring to Clann Cináeda meic Ailpín ("the Clan of Kenneth MacAlpin")—lay {{to the south}} of the previously dominant kingdom of Fortriu, centred in the lands around the River Tay. The extent of Kenneth's nameless kingdom is uncertain, but it certainly extended from the Firth of Forth in the south to the Mounth in the north. Whether it extended beyond the mountainous <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> north Britain—Druim Alban—is unclear. The core of the kingdom was similar to the old counties of Mearns, Forfar, Perth, Fife, and Kinross. Among the chief ecclesiastical centres named in the records are Dunkeld, probably seat of the bishop of the kingdom, and Cell Rígmonaid (modern St Andrews).|$|E

50|$|M. henrikseni {{has been}} shown to be part of the {{carapace}} of a bivalved bradoriid arthropod. However, the affinity of M. squamifer is still unresolved; the genus may transpire to be a form taxon, which would require M. henrikseni to be re-classified into a new genus. Unlike the <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> M. henrikseni, which flare out at the base where they attach to the cuticle, the <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> M. squamifer are more parallel-sided, with the fossil material becoming thinner towards the base: consistent with their attachment to non-mineralized cuticle. M. squamifer spines appear to have formed in pairs, owing to their symmetry; on this basis they have been likened to the <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> certain armoured lobopods known from Burgess shale-type deposits. This speculative claim has been substantiated for some material attributed to Mongolitubulus, based on similarities with the <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> the hallucigeniid lobopodians.|$|R

5|$|At an intersection, the {{incoming}} and outgoing lanes of traffic (including {{the ends of}} pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> a book embedding in their clockwise order around the junction. The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an outgoing lane of traffic that both {{belong to the same}} segment of road, representing a U-turn from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of paths that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book embedding. Thus, a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed embedding on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic paths through the junction.|$|E
