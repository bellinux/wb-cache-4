40|$|Lightning strokes to {{transmission}} lines causes {{a majority of}} the power quality issues that are so severe that sensitive industrial loads are disturbed. Historically Vattenfall concluded that it is too expensive to use <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> for the 132 kV grid due to the high soil resistivity in Sweden. Today the situation is different with sensitive industrial loads and the current Vattenfall standard is to build portal tower with one <b>shield</b> <b>wire.</b> The <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> is however not used {{to reduce the amount of}} lightning faults, it is used to ground the cross arm and reduce the amount of short circuits. In this project the lightning performance of different tower configurations used in the 132 kV grid is investigated using statistical insulation coordination in the softwares LPE and PSCAD. The optimal placement of the <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> on towers located on flat ground is determined. Furthermore, the <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> configuration of a new portal tower with two <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> and typical Swedish conditions is proposed and compared to a portal tower with one <b>shield</b> <b>wire.</b> The demand is that the amount of lightning faults should be reduced by half compared to the case with a portal tower without <b>shield</b> <b>wires.</b> It is concluded that in order to achieve this decrease in the amount of faults a portal tower with one <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> requires a tower foot resistance of 16. 5 while a portal tower with two <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> requires a tower foot resistance of 35. 1. The distribution between single line to ground faults and short circuits for both configurations is estimated, where a second <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> proved to reduce the amount of short circuits. Furthermore, it is concluded that every cross arm needs to be grounded properly in order to achieve the desired lightning performance. A cost estimation based on an average 132 kV line with average loading showed that a second <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> could not cover its own costs. It is important to remember that the cost estimation is based on an average 132 kV line and it does not consider important industries or costs of groundings. If this would be included a second <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> could be profitable in some cases. Therefore it is recommended to consider the local conditions when deciding if a new transmission line is built with one or two <b>shield</b> <b>wires...</b>|$|R

40|$|Lightning is a {{major problem}} in a {{transmission}} line system. Lightning which occurs around the world will give a huge effect on electrical transmission system and also on distribution system division. Lightning-strike commonly generated in two different ways. One of the ways is direct strike to a <b>wire</b> <b>shield</b> (tower top) and another way is shielding failure. A direct-strike to the <b>wire</b> <b>shield</b> generates back flashover as a result of voltage on insulator string magnitude is equal or exceeds the critical flashover voltage (CFO). Therefore, the insulation of surge arrester on transmission line is the way to reducing and finally solving the back flashover problem. This study modelled a 132 kV overhead transmission line for back flashover pattern by using ATP/EMTP software before and after implement the Haddad Surge Arrester Model. This study also analyzed and compares the performance of Haddad Surge Arrester Model with ABB Surge Arrester when four different magnitude lightning strike current is injected. From this study, it show that the Haddad Surge Arrester Model has archived the target to protect the transmission line system...|$|R

However, a radio controlled power unit using batteries or a petrol engine is normally required when the host conductor is on a high voltage transmission line. Wrapped cables can be applied to earth <b>wires</b> (ground <b>wires,</b> <b>shield</b> <b>wires)</b> on power transmission lines and to phase conductors on transmission, sub-transmission or distribution lines.|$|R

The m'ockup cable consisted of insulated wires on a kapton substrate, overlaid with a metallized teonex shield. Voltages induced on the <b>wires</b> and <b>shield</b> by the electron beam during irradiation were monitored, and voltage changes were used, along with video, to detect arcs due to the charge built-up in the cable. The cable was also cooled with liquid nitrogen to very low temperatures, to simulate cables {{kept in the dark}} for long periods of time. Arcing was common at fluences typical of long space missions. Occasionally an arc would occur some time after the electron beam was turned off. The conductivity of the <b>wires</b> and <b>shield</b> was monitored as a function of temperature, and behaved as expected, with lower conductivities at lower temperatures.

40|$|Lightning {{overvoltage}} is {{the major}} cause of transmission-line outage in Malaysia. The phenomenon is a dominant factor considered in designing substations and transmission-line insulation, so its investigation is important. This study is thus essential to ensuring consistent performance of transmission lines and electric power system. The work models a 132 kV overhead transmission line by using ATP-EMTP software, for back-flashover pattern recognition. It examines back-flashover studies, as they are essential to evaluation of lightning performance (in reality, most of the lightning strikes terminate at shield-wire rather than the phase-conductor). The full transmission-line model here is divided into several parts: <b>wires</b> (<b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> and phase conductors), towers, cross-arms, insulator strings, tower-surge impedance and towerfooting resistance. The developed model is then simulated with four magnitudes of lightning-strike current, to investigate the back-flashover voltage pattern across the line insulation of the transmission tower. The dissertation discusses effects of tower-footing resistance towards the back-flashover voltage observed. It presents the work’s findings, and recommends possible future works...|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} ways to prevent electromagnetic attacks is to make it difficult for an attacker to collect an electromagnetic signal at the physical level. Broadly, the hardware designer could design the encryption hardware to reduce signal strength or to protect the chip. Circuit and <b>wire</b> <b>shielding,</b> such as a Faraday cage, are effective in reducing the signal, as well as filtering the signal or introducing extraneous noise to mask the signal. Additionally, most electromagnetic attacks require attacking equipment to be very close to the target, so distance is an effective countermeasure.

40|$|Abstract- This {{paper has}} {{proposed}} a modeling method to simulate steady-state and transient induced voltages to an underground gas pipeline from an overhead transmission line. The simulation results of the steady-state ac induced voltages agree well with analytical results obtained from a well-known formula. The induced voltages are significantly dependent on the configuration of an overhead line. A hori-zontal line induces the largest voltage to a gas pipeline, and an induced voltage by a vertical twin-circuit line is smaller by about 20 % than that by a vertical single-circuit line. The simulation method is applied to investigate the effect of <b>shielding</b> <b>wires</b> and plates on reduction of the induced volt-age, and the simulation results agree well with analytical re-sults. It {{has been found that}} the induced voltage can be re-duced by about 10 % by one <b>shielding</b> <b>wire</b> and by about 25 % by five <b>shielding</b> <b>wires,</b> and an iron plate can reduce the in-duced voltage by about 50 % assuming the <b>shielding</b> <b>wires</b> and the plate are ideally grounded...|$|R

The screen, whose meshes are assumed to be square, its applicability to the measurement of mesh properties is described. The low-frequency magnetic shielding afforded by mesh enclosures is considered. Because of the reactive character of the mesh surface, the near field source shielding effectiveness decreases with increasing frequency. The enclosure magnetic-field shielding effectiveness increases with increasing frequency, but saturates at a maximum value that depends on the geometry of the mesh size, and the mesh wire radius. The enclosure electrostatic-field shielding effectiveness depends only on the enclosure and mesh geometries. Experimentally, shielding effectiveness measurements have been performed.

40|$|Several {{parts of}} an {{overhead}} transmission line have {{to be included in}} a model adequate for lightning overvoltage studies: <b>wires</b> (<b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> and phase conductors), towers, grounding, insulator strings and air clearances. An additional component, the surge arrester, should be added if the study is aimed at determining the lightning performance of a transmission line protected by surge arresters. This latter aspect is important since it can affect the model to be used for representing some parts of the line. Lightning is a physical phenomenon of random nature. The calculation of the lightning flashover rate must be performed taking into account this aspect, as well as the random behavior of some line component; e. g., insulator strings. The aim of this paper is twofold: on one hand, it presents a discussion about modeling guidelines proposed to date for representing {{overhead transmission line}}s in lightning studies; on the other hand, it proposes a methodology for selecting the most adequate model of an overhead transmission line in lightning overvoltage calculations, when using a time-domain simulation tool, e. g. an EMTP-like tool.

40|$|We {{have made}} the {{surprising}} discovery that the thermal damping of a vibrating wire resonator in superfluid He- 3 -B at ultra low temperatures is considerably depressed when a second wire in the vicinity is driven supercritically. The damping of a vibrating wire resonator at low velocities in the B-phase arises from the scattering of quasiparticle excitations and has a temperature dependence proportional to the Boltzmann factor exp(-Delta /kT) at low temperatures. At higher velocities (v > v(L) / 3), the wire breaks Cooper pairs and emits a quasiparticle beam. At first sight it seems paradoxical that heating the superfluid can reduce the quasiparticle flux: on a neighbouring wire. We can only understand this {{on the basis that}} vorticity emitted by the supercritical <b>wire</b> <b>shields,</b> via Andreev reflection, part of the background quasiparticle flux: from reaching the other wire. If this interpretation, is correct, these techniques will provide a sensitive probe of vortex dynamics in the ultra low temperature regime...|$|R

30|$|The paper {{presents}} a new methodology {{of the current}} unbalance calculation in meshed transmission systems. The meshed system consists of several sections with different phase arrangements, a different number of transmission lines on one tower, and a different number of <b>shield</b> <b>wires.</b> Some basic aspects of current unbalance have been mentioned in Sect.  1. As for calculations, several challenges described in Sect.  2 have been solved. Since {{it may be necessary}} to connect sections with a different number of <b>shield</b> <b>wires,</b> the virtual <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> have been created to keep impedance matrix dimensions, and the correct values of line supplying voltage sources have been determined for the required average values of the line currents by an appropriately designed optimization process. The unbalance factors for all the possible phase arrangements in the selected section C have been calculated, and the best solution has been found. The aforementioned procedures have been demonstrated in a case study of part of Czech transmission system designed for a new 400 kV substation connection. The best calculated transposition in section C was used, and values of calculated unbalance factors have been verified after putting the substation into operation. The measurement has shown very good agreement with the calculated values with an error less than 8 %. This is accepted as a very successful result taking into consideration a range of the line input parameters uncertainties. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the unbalance factor has been performed with view to the fact that the grounding input data is never easy to determine.|$|R
