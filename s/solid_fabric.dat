25|$|There are {{generally}} three layers in a quilt: the quilt top, the middle layer of batting, and the fabric backing. The quilt top is the design layer. The cotton or polyester batting {{in the middle}} layer is what determines {{the warmth of the}} quilt. Batting comes in different thicknesses depending on the purpose of the final quilt, and multiple layers of batting can be combined to increase the warmth of the final product. The bottom layer is often a simple layer of <b>solid</b> <b>fabric,</b> in a neutral or complimentary color and design scheme, though some quilters use the extra or spare fabric from the quilt top to make a secondary design for the backing.|$|E
60|$|A {{succession}} of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from {{the throat of}} the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated--I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess: {{but the thought of}} an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the <b>solid</b> <b>fabric</b> of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him who clamored. I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamorer grew still.|$|E

5000|$|This weave {{is based}} on the Régence weave, a kind of reps with all weft raised on the backside, which was popular during the regency of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans (lasting from 1715 to 1723). In the United States, {{at the end of the}} 19th century, the term was used in a broader sense, to {{describe}} either fabrics [...] "extremely dainty in construction and effect" [...] or silk shirtings. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the weave is rather found in <b>solid</b> <b>fabrics</b> for semi formal wear.|$|R
50|$|Sportswear in streetwear designs {{also change}} {{according}} to season. For example, with {{the drop of}} temperature, sports silhouette tends to turn slouchier, volumes become more exaggerated. <b>Solid</b> <b>fabrics</b> such as fur, velvet, wool and leather would become predominant, and quilted detailing on windbreakers, sporty skirts and vests may sometimes be seen in winter. Typical winter look can be voluminous sweatshirt with satin boxer shorts, or a brocade bomber worn {{on top of a}} laid-back dress featuring mesh detailing. In contrast, sportswear in summer usually look more light-weighted and simple. The summer look can be a combination of easy crop tops, sleek dresses and gym-shorts.|$|R
25|$|Another American {{group to}} develop a {{distinct}} style of quilting were the Amish. Typically, these quilts use only <b>solid</b> <b>fabrics,</b> are pieced from geometric shapes, do not contain appliqué, and construction is simple (corners are butted, rather than mitered, for instance) and done entirely by hand. Amish quilters also tend to use simple patterns: Lancaster County Amish {{are known for their}} Diamond-in-a-Square and Bars patterns, while other communities use patterns such as Brick, Streak of Lightning, Chinese Coins, and Log Cabins, and midwestern communities are known for their repeating block patterns. Borders and color choice also vary by community. For example, Lancaster quilts feature wide borders with lavish quilting, while Midwestern quilts feature narrower borders to balance the fancier piecing.|$|R
5000|$|While {{traditionally}} needlepoint {{has been}} done to create a <b>solid</b> <b>fabric,</b> more modern needlepoint incorporates colored canvas, a variety of fibers and beadwork. Different stitching techniques also allow some of the unstitched, or lightly stitched, canvas to show through, adding an entirely new dimension to needlepoint work. Some of these techniques include [...] "shadow" [...] or [...] "lite" [...] stitching, blackwork on canvas, and pattern darning.|$|E
50|$|Drop-stitch {{knitting}} is a knitting {{technique for}} producing open, vertical stripes in a garment. The basic {{idea is to}} knit a <b>solid</b> <b>fabric,</b> then (deliberately) drop one or more stitches (i.e., draw a loop out from the loop below it, and so on repeatedly), producing a run (or ladder) in the fabric. The run will continue to the bottom (i.e., cast-on) edge of the garment, or until it encounters an increase, at which it stops.|$|E
50|$|Speed-limiting drogues are single-element devices. They come {{in several}} {{varieties}} of canopy shapes that are circular in shape {{like a big}} round basket. Some are built with <b>solid</b> <b>fabric</b> while others are open in design to permit water to flow through them more readily. Holes or strips are usually cut in the drogue for stability, to reduce loads on the material, or both. Currently, the speed-limiting drogue is {{the most commonly used}} storm drogue with many designs available in the market place. See also drogue parachute.|$|E
50|$|A blazer {{is a type}} of jacket {{resembling}} a suit jacket, but cut more casually.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new method for {{measuring}} fabric wrinkle based on integrating photometric stereo and image analysis techniques. In the traditional method, wrinkled fabrics are evaluated sujectively {{according to the}} grades of replica plates supplied by the American Association of Textile Chemist and Colorist (AATCC). But due to the disadvantages of subjective methods, which are tedious, time-consuming, subjective, and so on, image analysis techniques are used in this work as an objective method. However, serious problem occur when colored and patterned fabrics are tested with conventional images and processing techniques, although they work for tests of <b>solid</b> <b>fabrics.</b> In this paper, a photometric stereo method is used to extract three-dimensional surface of fabrics and successfully eliminate the influence of color and pattern.

5000|$|A snood (...) is {{historically}} {{a type of}} female headgear designed to hold the hair in a cloth or yarn bag. In {{the most common form}} the headgear resembles a close-fitting hood worn {{over the back of the}} head. It is similar to a hairnet, but snoods typically have a looser fit, a much coarser mesh, and noticeably thicker yarn. A tighter-mesh band may cover the forehead or crown, then run behind the ears and under the nape of the neck. A sack of sorts dangles from this band, covering and containing the fall of long hair gathered at the back. A snood sometimes was made of <b>solid</b> <b>fabric,</b> but more often of loosely knitted yarn or other net-like material. Historically (and in some cultures still in use today) a small bag of fine thread - netted, tatted, knitted, crocheted, or knotted (see macrame) - [...] enclosed a bob of long hair on the back of the head or held it close to the nape.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{cost for}} nonpoint source in urban area tends to {{increase}} as it's distanced farther from the pollution source. Thus it's more effective {{to dispose of the}} pollution at the pollution source. It becomes more difficult when nonpoint source is flowed into the surface water by stormwater. In case of combined sewer, increasing stormwater on impermeable surface causes the Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) containing the high level of pollutants which runs into the water system through the storm overflow diverging tank without treatment process. A huge amount of CSOs is generated instantly and as it carries the pollutants on impermeable surface as well as the deposits in sewage pipe, it's necessary to develop the technology for treatment of CSOs. This study was intended to develop the <b>solid</b> <b>fabric</b> filter which will be suitable for treatment of CSOs and the characteristic and performance of <b>solid</b> <b>fabric</b> filter were evaluated...|$|E

40|$|In this article, Elżbieta Ostrowska employs {{categories}} of postcolonialism to examine two novels by Henryk Sienkiewicz, With Fire and Sword and Fire in the Steppe, and their filmic adaptations by Jerzy Hoffman. Her {{aim is to}} reconstruct their ideological discourse regarding Polish national identity and its positioning within Europe. Located between east and west, Poland was both a colonizing power (of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Belorussia) and a colonized country (by Russia, Prussia, and Austria-Hungary). These two novels, written {{during the time of}} partitions, offer a nostalgic vision of the country’s past power and its colonizing aspirations. Ostrowska argues that various textual efforts aimed at solidifying the notion of national identity and its positioning within a geopolitical order of Europe are disrupted by structures of female desire implicitly present in both the novels and films. These structures puncture the <b>solid</b> <b>fabric</b> of the national historical epic and undermine the hegemonic notion of Polish masculinity...|$|E

ABSTRACT: Tally is an art practiced by traditional women in Upper Egypt. The art {{is known as a}} special kind of embroidery, which uses metal threads on <b>solid</b> <b>fabric</b> or net material. It dates back to the 18 th century. It has been used for occasion dresses and shawls. Special Pharaonic, Coptic and Islamic motifs identify this art, in addition to motifs derived from the Egyptian folk heritage such as camel, palm tree, doll and the jockey, which has been formulated in various forms along with abstract geometric motifs, due to the global fashion trend towards the use of luxury fabrics, like studded and embroidered with golden and silver threads. Therefore, the current research will focus on the use of Egyptian Tally motifs to innovate suitable designs for modern fashion of printed upholstery fabrics using metallic printing on organza fabric, It is a special printing process that produces a shiny design. It can be easily transferred on the fabric, with Foil stamping which is a print process applied of metallic foil, often gold or silver...|$|E

40|$|Aedes polynesiensis Marks (Diptera: Culicidae) is {{the primary}} vector of lymphatic {{filariasis}} (LF) in the island countries and territories of the South Pacific. In {{the development of a}} novel control tool, the response of Ae. polynesiensis to six different colours (three <b>solid</b> <b>fabrics,</b> two patterned fabrics and a plastic tarp) was measured using a digital photographic system. Adult mosquitoes were placed into an environmental chamber and allowed to choose between a white target and one of six experimental targets. Mosquito landing frequency and landing duration were calculated. Adult female Ae. polynesiensis preferred all of the experimental targets to the white control target. Mosquito landing frequency was highest for the solid targets (black, navy blue and red) followed in turn by the two colour pattern targets and the polyethylene target. Mosquito landing duration was greater for experimental targets when compared with white control targets. Mosquito landing frequencies did not change over time {{during the course of the}} assay. The response of male Ae. polynesiensis was also measured when exposed to a 100 % cotton black target. Male mosquitoes preferred the black target to the white control target, although at levels lower than that observed in female mosquitoes. The results suggest that future investigations evaluating the visual responses of Ae. polynesiensis mosquitoes are warranted, with a special emphasis on semi-field and field-based experiments...|$|R
40|$|Mulches augment soil {{moisture}} availability to plants by restraining direct evaporation of soil water. Yet, in field conditions wind decreases their {{resistance to water}} vapor transport, diminishing their efficiency as a water conservation measure. The relation between vapor transport resistance and wind speed was investigated in a wind tunnel where air flow was turbulent. The mulch material was chopped straw with bulk densities of 31 and 37 Â kgÂ m- 3, and chemically stabilized aggregates segregated in diameter classes 1 - 2, 2 - 4, 4 - 8, 8 - 11. 2 Â mm, in layers 10 - 100 Â mm thick. The resistance decreased exponentially with increasing wind speed from the molecular diffusion value at zero wind speed, suggesting that turbulence penetrates the pores of the mulch and drives convective water vapor transport. Resistance rose exponentially with increasing layer thickness, a mirror reflection of the turbulence decay profile. Higher bulk density of the straw and finer aggregates augmented the resistance. The convective component of the vapor transport resistance was related to mulch area index, defined as the surface area of the solid elements of mulch per unit covered ground area. This procedure merged the effect of layer thickness and that of straw bulk density or aggregates size into a single function, indicating that friction forces proportional to internal area of the <b>solid</b> <b>fabric</b> restrain the penetration of momentum in the porous medium. Two-layered mulches combining straw and aggregates have a higher resistance {{than the sum of}} the resistances of the individual components as is expected from the attenuation of convection in the top layer. The functions derived in this study can serve as input for models evaluating the impact of mulches on soil water balance.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} modern {{quilting}} {{movement from the}} perspective of members of the Modern Quilt Guild (MQG), a new guild that includes both online and in-person elements. Twenty-six members of seven MQG’s across the United States were interviewed. The interviews focused on the factors that draw participants into the MQG as well as how the art/craft debate shapes the experiences of modern quilters. This study concludes that modern quilting is both an attitude and an aesthetic. The attitude of modern quilting encompasses common themes among participants like the lack of rules dictating their quilting practices and an open and inviting atmosphere at meetings. The attitude portion of modern quilting was present to some degree in all participants of this study. The current aesthetic of modern quilting emphasizes clean lines, minimalism, and <b>solid</b> <b>fabrics,</b> among many other characteristics. All the participants of this study did not embody the aesthetic of modern quilting. The results suggest that all participants are drawn to the guild due to the attitude of modern quilting whereas only some participants are inclined to join due to the aesthetic of modern quilting. The aesthetic of modern quilting {{does not appear to be}} tied to the art/craft debate in that most participants did not link the differences between art and craft to their own work. The study also illustrates the excitement, motivation, and enjoyment that surrounds MQG membership for the participants of this study. Advisor: Michael Jame...|$|R

40|$|Classification of wasted woollen {{textiles}} {{on the basis}} of their colour is a basic approach for the supply of a raw material which does not involve the cost of the colouring process. Colour classification is a very difficult task, especially when a fabric is composed by differently coloured fibre (melange fabric). Many systems have been developed in the last years for colour classification of textiles. Unfortunately such colour classification systems are not able to correctly classify melange fabrics. In the present work a method for real-time classification of melange colour woollen fabrics is proposed. The provided approach, that is suitable also for classifying <b>solid</b> colour <b>fabrics,</b> integrates a Machine Vision (MV) system, able to acquire high resolution images, with a clustering algorithm capable of mapping the colour pixel of fabric images into a series of colour classes.

A number of workers have reported log number reductions in bacteria seeded onto <b>solid</b> surfaces, <b>fabrics</b> and agar media when in close proximity to the ions source (1 - 4). The aim of this research was to investigate and compare the antimicrobial efficacy of two sources of ionisation – a corona discharge and a flame. The use of antimicrobial volatile compounds to increase the antibacterial efficacy for these ionisation sources was also investigated. Paraffin wax candles and an ion wind generator delivering an air flow of 0. 6 m/second were used as ion sources and dispersal methods for the volatile ?-pinene. Experiments were conducted in enclosed test booths. The results demonstrated that the combination of an ionising source, such as a corona discharge or a candle flame, with a bactericidal volatile have a greater effect on surface-borne bacteria than either treatment alone. These effects could arise through the direct vapour adsorption onto microorganisms being promoted through the impingement and action of ions...|$|R

50|$|Quilting was a {{very popular}} early American pastime, first in the Midwest, where {{quilting}} circles were a common social pastime for women, and later on the Great Plains, especially from 1825 to 1875, where quilting bees, when many women gathered around a quilting frame and quilted, became important social occasions. Such affairs might last overnight and sometimes took on political significance, such as during the movement for abolition. Annual town fairs generally included a quilting prize to award excellence in quilting. Handmade quilts were a very common wedding gift for young couples, and were often mentioned specifically in wills due to their sentimental significance. It was not uncommon, in early American culture, for quilts to reflect a mosaic of a woman's life, often including swatches of material from memorable events such as pieces of a wedding gown or a child's baptismal garment. The Amish people are famous for their geometric patchwork designs made with <b>solid</b> color <b>fabrics,</b> with independent patterns and quilting; typical motifs include floral designs and heart shapes.
