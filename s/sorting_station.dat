40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{are facing a}} great challenge to collect, treat and dispose their waste in a more sustainable way. Today, most of the produced waste ends up on landfills, where they pose a great threat {{to the environment and}} human health. Kumasi, the second largest city in Ghana, faces the same issues as other cities in developing countries; waste management is run poorly and most waste ends up on the cities largest landfill, Dompoase, which will be full in a few years time. Issues such as low financial resources, bad urban planning and a growing population aggravate the implementation of a more sustainable development. Since most solid waste in developing countries is organic, composting is a good option towards a more sustainable waste management. There are numerous amounts of articles stating that decentralized composting is the best option for developed countries. Decentralized compost facilities are less costly to install and maintain, they require less technology and decrease the cost of waste transportation. Transportation poses a large expense when it comes  to waste management in developing countries. There is an advantage in integrating a more sustainable waste management in to the existing waste infrastructure since cities often are densely built up and {{there is a shortage of}} land. Therefore this thesis has investigated the possibilities of having waste <b>sorting</b> <b>stations</b> and decentralized compost facilities at public dumping sites in the Bantama area, one of ten sub [...] ‐metros in Kumasi. Based on literature and observations during field visits in the Bantama area, a classification scheme was developed. The classification scheme was designed to simplify identification and differentiation of the sites. It contains thirteen criteria to consider when planning for organic waste <b>sorting</b> <b>stations</b> and decentralized compost facilities. Suitable sites for <b>sorting</b> <b>stations</b> and decentralized compost facilities were selected by a SQL analyzes in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The analyzes was based on the classification scheme. The result shows that of twenty [...] ‐one public dumpingsites, seven were suitable as <b>sorting</b> <b>stations</b> and two sites were suitable for a decentralized compost facility. The expectation is that in due time and with infrastructure improvements, more than only seven communal sites can become <b>sorting</b> <b>stations.</b> When it comes to sites for composting the result reveals an issue in many cities  there is just not enough land to build as many decentralized facilities as would be necessary to recycle all organic waste. However, due to the advantages of having decentralized facilities, the recommendation is that Kumasi should start with a decentralized approach and as finance and technological skills exists the organic waste management can extend to also include larger facilities. Further this thesis shows the advantage of having decentralized composting when it comes totransportation costs. A transport analyzes was done in a GIS,  which showed the difference intransportation distances between having decentralized and centralized composting. The result showed that waste recycled close to its source, i. e. having decentralized waste management, is transported shorter distance compared to having centralized composting and  thus saving on cost for transportation...|$|R

In the first step, a simple size sorting based on mathematical binarization is described, and the second step is to segment the defects; to do this, color based classifiers are used. All the detection standards for this work are referenced from the United States Agriculture Department, and Canadian Food Industries. Results show that we have a high accuracy in both size sorting and classification. Experimental results show that support vector machines have very high accuracy and speed between classifiers for defect detection...|$|R

The site of intracellular sorting and pathways used for the apical delivery of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are largely unclear. Using biochemical assays and confocal and video microscopy in living cells, we show that newly synthesized GPI-APs are directly delivered to the apical surface of fully polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Impairment of basolateral membrane fusion by treatment with tannic acid does not affect the direct apical delivery of GPI-APs, but it does affect the organization of tight junctions and the integrity of the monolayer. Our data clearly demonstrate that GPI-APs are directly sorted to the apical surface without passing through the basolateral membrane. They also reinforce the hypothesis that apical sorting of GPI-APs occurs intracellularly before arrival at the plasma membrane...|$|R

Over the last few years, modern morphological approaches have generated new insights into the questions of PGC biogenesis, structure and dynamics. Here, we present a view by which the “lifecycle ” of a PGC consists of several distinct stages: the formation of TGN tubular export domains (where diVerent cargoes are segregated from each other and from the Golgi enzymes); the docking of these tubular domains onto molecular motors and their extrusion towards the cell periphery along microtubules; the Wssion of the forming PGC from the donor membrane; and the delivery of the newly formed PGC to its speciWc acceptor organelle.

The vibrant instability of these structures challenges the classical view of defined, static compartments that are connected by different types of vesicles. Despite this astonishing complexity, proteins and lipids are accurately transported into the different intracellular membrane systems. Over {{the past few decades}} many factors have been identified that either mediate or regulate intracellular membrane trafficking. Like in a modern parcel sorting system of a logistics center, the cargo typically passes through several sequential <b>sorting</b> <b>stations</b> until it finally reaches the location that is specified by its individual address label. While each membrane system employs specific sets of factors, the transport processes typically operate on common principles.
