5|$|Believing that Gary, the Nosferatu chief, {{has stolen}} the <b>sarcophagus,</b> the fledgling {{is sent to}} Hollywood to find him; after {{locating}} a captured Nosferatu for Gary, he reveals that the <b>sarcophagus</b> was stolen by the Giovanni vampire clan. The fledgling infiltrates the Giovanni mansion and finds the <b>sarcophagus</b> guarded by the Kuei-Jin, who claim their leader, Ming-Xiao, has formed an alliance with LaCroix. The locked <b>sarcophagus</b> is returned to LaCroix's tower and Beckett, a vampire historian, tells the fledgling that {{the only person who}} can open it has been abducted by Grunfeld to lure LaCroix. The fledgling kills Grunfeld and learns that the sarcophagus' key has been stolen.|$|E
5|$|On two occasions, species {{based on}} valid Albertosaurus {{material}} were reassigned {{to a different}} genus: in 1922 William Diller Matthew renamed A. <b>sarcophagus</b> into Deinodon <b>sarcophagus</b> and in 1939 German paleontologist Oskar Kuhn renamed A. arctunguis into Deinodon arctunguis.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{statistically}} analyze, and interpret anthropoid Phoenician <b>sarcophagi</b> {{found on the}} Syrian coast (archaeological site of Amrīt), from an archaeological perspective. All <b>sarcophagi</b> (11 complete and 8 damaged) under the study are dated between the fifth and fourth centuries BCE. We must highlight how previous scholars established periods of use {{as well as the}} influence of these funeral artifacts, viewing them purely as works of art. The main goal of this research is to study the <b>sarcophagi</b> from an archaeological perspective with reference to the quantitative data taken from each piece. The data set which we analyze is composed of the dimensional components of twenty-two <b>sarcophagi.</b> The challenge to be overcome in the analysis of this data set is the state of the <b>sarcophagi</b> themselves; half of them are damaged to an extent that direct measurements are impossible. Thus, a statistical analysis is necessarily based on estimates of original measurements of undamaged parts of those <b>sarcophagi.</b> Accordingly, we carried out an analysis of the dependence between the dimensional components of the complete, relatively undamaged <b>sarcophagi.</b> Given the anthropomorphic morphology of <b>sarcophagi,</b> the length and width present a significant linear relationship, whereas there is no relationship between length and height...|$|R

5|$|In the {{interior}} of the pyramid a descending passage led, behind three granite portcullises, to an antechamber, three magazine rooms and the burial chamber. In it, pieces of alabaster and a faience bead on a gold thread were discovered as well as many fragments of what was originally a large <b>sarcophagus</b> of dark grey basalt. The <b>sarcophagus</b> was sunk into the floor of the burial chamber together with a niche for the canopic chest of the king to its north-east. An almost complete mummy was discovered in the remnants of the <b>sarcophagus.</b> An examination by Ahmed Batrawi of these skeletal remains, excavated in the mid-1940s under the direction of Abdel Salam Hussein, suggests that Djedkare {{died at the age of}} 50 to 60 years old.|$|E

50|$|The Dokimeion {{workshops}} in Phrygia specialized in architecturally formed large-scale Asiatic <b>sarcophagi.</b> Many featured {{a series of}} columns joined together by an entablature on all four sides with human figures in the area between the columns. The lids were often made in the gabled-roof design in order to complete the architectural-style <b>sarcophagi</b> so the coffin formed a sort of house or temple for the deceased. Other cities in Asia Minor produced <b>sarcophagi</b> of the garland tradition as well. In general, the <b>sarcophagi</b> were decorated on either three or four sides, depending on whether {{they were to be}} displayed on a pedestal in an open-air setting or against the walls inside tombs.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{causeway}} was a large hall leading to a pillared open court surrounded by magazine chambers. The court led into the mortuary temple proper which housed statues of the king and where the offerings to the deceased took place. This was immediately adjacent to {{the eastern side of the}} pyramid, which was surrounded by an enclosure wall defining the sacred space. At the southeast corner of the enclosure was a small satellite pyramid for the Ka of the king. The internal chambers of the pyramid were entered in 1881 by Gaston Maspero, who thus discovered the pyramid texts. The burial chamber housed nothing but a black basalt <b>sarcophagus</b> sunk into the floor and a canopic chest. The <b>sarcophagus</b> proved to contain scattered bones, which may belong to Unas.|$|E

Tintin discovers that the tomb is full of boxes of cigars labelled with a mysterious symbol, but he and <b>Sarcophagus</b> fall unconscious after an unseen enemy gasses them. They are then taken aboard a ship inside wooden sarcophagi, captained by smuggler Allan, but to avoid the coastguard Allan orders Tintin and Snowy thrown overboard. They are rescued by a gunrunner who sails them to Arabia. Travelling by land, Tintin meets Sheikh Patrash Pasha, {{a big fan of}} his, and encounters Rastapopoulos filming a movie. The local army drafts Tintin and then arrests him as a spy, before Thomson and Thompson rescue him so that they can arrest him.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Plymouth Rock Memorial, several other monuments were constructed in celebration of Plymouth's tricentennial.

5|$|Thutmose I was {{the first}} king who {{definitely}} {{was buried in the}} Valley of the Kings. Ineni was commissioned to dig this tomb, and presumably to build his mortuary temple. His mortuary temple has not been found, quite possibly because it was incorporated into or demolished by the construction of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. His tomb, however, has been identified as KV38. In it was found a yellow quartzite <b>sarcophagus</b> bearing the name of Thutmose I. His body, however, may have been moved by Thutmose III into the tomb of Hatshepsut, KV20, which also contains a <b>sarcophagus</b> with the name of Thutmose I on it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sarcophagi</b> {{production}} of the Ancient Roman Empire involved three main parties: the customer, the sculpting workshop that carved the monument, and the quarry-based workshop that supplied the materials. The distance between these parties was highly variable due to the extensive size of the Empire. Metropolitan Roman, Attic, and Asiatic were the three major regional types of <b>sarcophagi</b> that dominated trade throughout the Roman Empire. Although they were divided into regions, the {{production of}} <b>sarcophagi</b> was {{not as simple as}} it might appear. For example, Attic workshops were close to Mount Pentelikon, the source of their materials, but were usually very far from their client. The opposite was true for the workshops of Metropolitan Rome, who tended to import large, roughed out <b>sarcophagi</b> from distant quarries in order to complete their commissions. Depending on distance and customer request (some customers might choose to have elements of their <b>sarcophagi</b> left unfinished until a future date, introducing the possibility of further work after the main commission), <b>sarcophagi</b> were in many different stages of production during transport. As a result, it is difficult to develop a standardized model of production.|$|R
5|$|Alternatively, Dawn Landua-McCormack {{suggested}} that the Southern South Saqqara pyramid {{could have been a}} candidate for Neferhotep's burial site. This pyramid, datable to the middle 13th Dynasty, was provided with two elaborate <b>sarcophagus</b> chambers which might have been destined for two wealthy brother kings of the dynasty such as Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV.|$|E
5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily {{resurrection of the}} dead at the Second Coming of Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a <b>sarcophagus,</b> while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing <b>sarcophagus,</b> perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the {{committee}} met with Lutyens in January 1919 to discuss options for the memorial. Lutyens argued against {{the committee}}'s initial proposed location on Asylum Green in favour of Watts Park, which the committee agreed to. Lutyen's initial design consisted of a large ceremonial pillar with a substantial archway on either side, each archway supporting a soldier lying on a <b>sarcophagus.</b> This was rejected due to the likely cost and instead Lutyens suggested a single empty <b>sarcophagus</b> or cenotaph, supported by a plinth {{on top of a}} pillar, with pine cones mounted on urns standing on each side. This was agreed to at a public meeting in September and detailed work on the project began. The London firm of Holloway Brothers were selected as the contractor for the memorial; the project was completed to time at a total cost of £9,845.|$|E

40|$|Pliny {{speaks of}} the stone of Assus in the Troad as {{suitable}} for making <b>sarcophagi</b> due to its special property of consuming the buried bodies within 40 days. This belief was at {{the basis of the}} production {{of a large number of}} <b>sarcophagi</b> in the II and III centuries and their export to several Mediterranean towns. In a previous archaeometric research it was demonstrated that such <b>sarcophagi</b> could have been made not only from the andesite of Assos, but also from others outcropping on the island of Lesbos and at Pergamum. The present study has completed an initial mineropetrographic and geochemical database of the quarries and outcrops and subjected samples from 27 <b>sarcophagi</b> found at Thessalonica, Lesbos (Mytilene and Methymna), Tyre, Alexandria (Egypt), Durres and Ravenna to the same laboratory methodologies (OM, XRD, XRF, ICP).
