5000|$|The {{conflict}} of these forces awakens <b>She</b> Who <b>Must</b> <b>Not</b> Be Named. Linden and her companions follow the ur‑viles and Waynhim in seeking a way out, and {{rely heavily on}} the strength and endurance of Ironhand Coldspray and her Swordmainnir.

Exposed more intimately to the banes evil than the other party members by her Earthsight [...] - [...] and being a more ready target due to her family history of abuse and despair [...] - [...] Lindens hope finally fails when the party is cornered, and she falls into a catatonic state, deeply traumatized. Covenant first tries to reason with <b>She</b> Who <b>Must</b> <b>Not</b> be Named, then tries to convince Esmer to reveal her true name which would release her. When Esmer refuses, Covenant asks Anele to use Liands orcrest stone to summon the spirits of his parents, Sunder and Hollian. They leave, however, and summon High Lord Elenas spirit as bait for <b>She</b> Who <b>Must</b> <b>Not</b> Be Named. This ploy succeeds at delaying <b>She</b> Who <b>Must</b> <b>Not</b> Be Named from attacking the group. As Elena is being consumed Covenant convinces Esmer to leave them, which allows the Ardent to transport the company away.|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, {{it was decided that}} Queen Elizabeth was so vital to the war effort that <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> have her {{movements}} tracked by German spies operating in the Clydebank area. Therefore, an elaborate ruse was fabricated involving her sailing to Southampton to complete her fitting out. Another factor prompting Queen Elizabeths departure was the necessity to clear the fitting out berth at the shipyard for the battleship , which was in need of its final fitting-out. Only the berth at John Brown could accommodate the King George V-class battleship's needs.|$|E

500|$|In 1827, the Duke of York died, {{making the}} Duke of Clarence heir {{presumptive}} and Victoria second-in-line to the throne. Conroy {{complained that the}} princess should not be surrounded by commoners, leading King George IV to appoint Conroy a Knight Commander of the Hanoverian Order and a Knight Bachelor that year. The Duchess and Conroy continued to be unpopular with the Royal Family and, in 1829, the Duke of Cumberland spread rumours that they were lovers {{in an attempt to}} discredit them. The Duke of Clarence referred to Conroy as [...] "King John", while the Duchess of Clarence wrote to the Duchess of Kent to advise that she was increasingly isolating herself from the Royal Family and that <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> grant Conroy too much power.|$|E
500|$|At last, the {{two girls}} {{stand in front of}} the Wizard. He turns out to be not quite as terrifying as they thought ("A Sentimental Man"). He {{promises}} Elphaba that he will grant her request if she proves herself. Madame Morrible appears; she is the Wizard's new [...] "Press Secretary". She gives Elphaba an ancient book of spells, called the [...] "Grimmerie," [...] which only the magically gifted can read. Elphaba is asked to try a levitation spell on the Wizard's monkey servant, Chistery. However, the spell doesn't go the way Elphaba plans when Chistery sprouts wings, and she realizes that the Wizard is the one behind the suppression of the Animals. Elphaba has been tricked, and instead of just performing the spell on one monkey, she actually performed the spell on all of them. Elphaba realizes that the Wizard is not who she thought he was - he has no powers; he is merely a charlatan who cannot read the Grimmerie. He offers her and Glinda everything they've ever wanted if they will help him, but Elphaba is unable to comply. She runs away, and in order to prevent the truth from getting out, Madame Morrible spreads reports that Elphaba is [...] "wicked," [...] not to be trusted, and claims that Elphaba is the one behind the animal mischief. This only reaffirms Elphaba's belief that <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> let anyone hold her down; she must go on her own to do what's best for her. She performs a spell on a broom and flies. ("Defying Gravity").|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from November 19, 1910. It states: [...] "Paul and Virginia are two young lovers who have grown up together from babyhood. Their widowed mothers lived near each other in rude cottages, on {{an island in the}} Indies, on which there are few inhabitants. Here the children are reared, knowing no play fellows but each other. When Virginia is 16 years of age, her mother receives a letter from a wealthy aunt in Paris, who offers to make Virginia her heir and give her a good education, providing Virginia will, in the future, make her aunt's home her own. Virginia's mother, having lost her own fortune through marrying against the will of her family, feels that <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> let her daughter suffer the poverty that she has been compelled to endure. She accordingly insists upon Virginia's acceptance of her wealthy relatives offer. Virginia thereupon sets sail for France, leaving Paul broken-hearted at her departure. Virginia tries to be a dutiful niece to her aunt, who is very old and sickly, although she longs to return to her humble home and Paul, whom she dearly loves. When, however, the aunt insists that she marry a rich nobleman, Virginia refuses; her aunt disowns the girl and sends her back to the island home. Virginia's ship arrives at the Indies during a hurricane, and although a cable's length from shore, it sinks before help can reach it, and Virginia is drowned. Paul witnesses her death from the shore, and almost loses his own life in a vain attempt to save her." ...|$|E

500|$|At this moment, cries {{are heard}} from the Knights (""): a flying swan has been shot, and a young man is brought forth, a bow {{in his hand and}} a quiver of {{matching}} arrows. Gurnemanz speaks sternly to the lad, saying this is a holy place. He asks him outright if he shot the swan, and the lad boasts that if it flies, he can hit it ("") Gurnemanz tells him that the swan is a holy animal, and asks what harm the swan had done him, and shows the youth its lifeless body. Now remorseful, the young man breaks his bow and casts it aside. Gurnemanz asks him why he is here, who his father is, how he found this place and, lastly, his name. To each question the lad replies, [...] "I don't know." [...] The elder Knight sends his squires away to help the King and now asks the boy to tell what he does know. The young man says he has a mother, Herzeleide (Heart's Sorrow) and that he made the bow himself. Kundry has been listening and now tells them that this boy's father was Gamuret, a knight killed in battle, and also how the lad's mother had forbidden her son to use a sword, fearing that he would meet the same fate as his father. The youth now recalls that upon seeing knights pass through his forest, he had left his home and mother to follow them. Kundry laughs and tells the young man that, as she rode by, she saw Herzeleide die of grief. Hearing this, the lad first lunges at Kundry but then collapses in grief. Kundry herself is now weary for sleep, but cries out that <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> sleep and wishes that she might never again waken. She disappears into the undergrowth.|$|E
2500|$|David Flint, National Convenor of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, {{said that}} any {{criticism}} of the South African tour should be directed {{to the government and}} not the Governor-General. He said: [...] "The Governor-General must act on advice, except in relation to her most important role, that of constitutional guardian. She may advise against a state visit, but if ministers insist, must go. In that event, <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> of course act as an advocate, although she may inform the foreign government of the Australian government's policy." [...] He said that a governor-general must be seen to be above politics.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 The Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that IslamOnline was asked {{the following question}} [...] "Are raped women punished in Islam?", and a panel headed by Qaradawi replied: [...] "To be absolved from guilt, the raped woman must have shown some sort of good conduct.... Islam addresses women to maintain their modesty, as not {{to open the door}} for evil.... The Koran calls upon Muslim women in general to preserve their dignity and modesty, just to save themselves from any harassment.... So for a rape victim to be absolved from guilt, <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> be the one that opens ... her dignity for deflowering." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{discussing}} Petruchio's objectification of Katherina, Tita French Baumlin {{focuses on}} his puns on her name. By {{referring to her}} as a [...] "cake" [...] and a [...] "cat" [...] (2.1.185–195), he objectifies her in a more subtle manner than saying she belongs to him. A further aspect of Petruchio's taming rhetoric is the repeated comparison of Katherina to animals. In particular, he is prone to comparing her to a hawk (2.1.8 and 4.1.177–183), often employing an overarching hunting metaphor; [...] "My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,/And till she stoop <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> be full-gorged" [...] (4.1.177–178). Katherina, however, appropriates this method herself, leading to a trading of insults rife with animal imagery in Act 2, Scene 1 (ll.207–232), where she compares Petruchio to a turtle and a crab.|$|E
