5000|$|The first array {{approaches}} {{attempted to}} miniaturize biochemical and immunobiological assays usually performed in 96-well microtiter plates. While 96-well plate-based antibody arrays have high-throughput capability, the small surface area in each well limits {{the number of}} antibody spots and thus, the number of analytes detected. Other solid supports, such as glass slides and nitrocellulose membranes, were subsequently utilized to develop arrays which could accommodate larger panels of antibodies.Nitrocellulose membrane-based arrays are flexible, easy to handle, and have increased protein binding capacity, but are less amenable to high throughput or automated processing. Chemically derivatized glass slides allow for printing of sub-microliter sized antibody spots, reducing the array surface area without sacrificing <b>spot</b> <b>density.</b> This in turn reduces the volume of sample consumed. Glass slide-based arrays, owing to their smooth and rigid structure, can also be easily fitted to high-throughput liquid handling systems.|$|E

5000|$|The more {{recently}} developed laser peening process, the Toshiba LPwC process, varies in significant ways {{from the process}} described above. The LPwC process utilizes low energy, high frequency Nd-YAG lasers producing pulse energies of ≤ 0.1 J and pulse durations of ≤ 10 ns, using spot sizes [...] ≤1 mm diameter. Because the process originally was intended to operate in large water-filled vessels, the wave frequency was doubled to halve the wavelength to 532 μm. The shorter wavelength decreases the absorption of beam energy while traveling through water to the target. Due to access constraints, no opaque overlay {{is applied to the}} target surface. This factor, combined with the small spot size, requires many shots to achieve a significant surface compressive stress and depths of 1 mm. The first layers applied produce a tensile surface stress due to surface melting, although a compressive stress is developed below the melt layer. However, as more layers are added, the increasing subsurface compressive stress [...] "bleeds" [...] back through the melted surface layer to produce the desired surface compressive stress. Depending on material properties and the desired compressive stresses, generally about 18 spots/mm2 to 70 spots/mm2 or greater <b>spot</b> <b>densities</b> are applied, about 100 times the <b>spot</b> <b>densities</b> of the high pulse energy process. The effects of the higher <b>spot</b> <b>densities</b> on processing times are compensated for in part by the higher pulse frequency, 60 Hz, of the low energy lasers. Newer generations of these laser systems are projected to operate at higher frequencies. This low energy process achieves compressive residual stress magnitudes and depths equivalent to the high energy process with nominal depths of 1 to 1.5 mm. However, the smaller spot size will not permit depths deeper than this.|$|R

We also manipulated the colour of eggs when the original spot pattern remained the same. <b>Spot</b> <b>density</b> (approximately 15 - 75 %) did not significantly affect rejection rate (8 - 20 % rejection), but when spots fully covered the eggs, i. e. the eggshell was plain dark brown, rejection rate increased abruptly to 100 %.

The present paper aims to identify, using the Grassberger-Procaccia correlation dimension (CD) algorithm, {{the existence of}} a nonlinear deterministic and chaotic dynamic behaviour in the spatial pattern of arsenic, manganese and zinc concentration in a Russian coal waste disposal site. The analysis carried out yielded embedding dimension values ranging between 7 and 8 suggesting thus from a chaotic dynamic perspective that arsenic, manganese and zinc concentration in space is a medium dimensional problem for the regionalized scale considered in this study. This alternative nonlinear dynamics approach may complement conventional geostatistical studies and may be also used for the estimation of risk and the subsequent screening and selection of a feasible remediation scheme in wider mining and waste disposal sites.
