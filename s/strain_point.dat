5000|$|To anneal glass, it is {{necessary}} to heat it to its annealing temperature, at which its viscosity, η, drops to 1013 Poise ("Poise" [...] is a measure of absolute viscosity; 1 poise = 1 dyne-second/cm²). For most kinds of glass, this annealing temperature is in the range of 850-900 °F (454 - 482 °C), and is the so-called stress-relief point or annealing point of the glass. At such a viscosity, the glass still is too hard for significant external deformation without breaking, but it is soft enough to relax internal strains by microscopic flow in response to the intense stresses they introduce internally. The piece then heat-soaks until its temperature is even throughout and the stress relaxation is adequate. The time necessary for this step varies {{depending on the type of}} glass and its maximum thickness. The glass then is permitted to cool at a predetermined rate until its temperature passes the <b>strain</b> <b>point</b> (η = 1014.5 Poise), below which even microscopic internal flow effectively stops and annealing stops with it.

The specimen has a large width to height ratio and a small height to thickness ratio. The forces in tensile and shear direction are easily measured and the tensile stress and shear stress can easily be derived.

This stress {{is a result of}} the constraint, imposed by the large width to height ratio and cannot be measured directly. The strain in the specimen is measured on the surface. By imposing the Drucker normality principle, the direction of the tangent to the yield surface is known and the unknown stress increment in lateral direction can be obtained.
