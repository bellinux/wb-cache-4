5000|$|The Universal Century {{technologies}} {{debuted in}} Gundam Century, written by editors, academy and studios hired by OUT magazine at that time, later {{part of the}} book was endorsed by Sunrise and Bandai, and some {{of the authors of the}} articles within Gundam Century became official editors and writers of Gundam mechanics. [...] A main {{part of the book}} surrounds the discussion on real-life technologies including space habitats and mass driver. Later, following the trend of militaristic and technological interest in the community, Gundam Sentinel Special Edition included a section called imidam 0093 (Innovative Mobile Suit Information Dictionary, Annual Series, intentionally using an m at the end to reference Gundam), subtitled [...] "Basic Knowledge of Gundam Mechanics". Written by mechanical designer Katoki Hajime, summarized both in- and out-of-universe technologies of the Universal Century, sourcing from Gundam Century, Gun Sight, VF-1 Valkyrie, MS Graphical Guide 1~3, MSV Technical & History 1~3. [...] Gundam Officials has collected this information and has presented it along with plot history and character summaries in an encyclopedic form, and MS Encyclopedia 2003 has a <b>short</b> <b>technical</b> <b>summary</b> of these technologies in its first section before going into the lists of mobile weapons in different series, which earlier editions only have.|$|E

In the process world view {{the universe is}} the ultimate (intensional) transaction of all its extensional limiting processes that we call reality. ANPA’s PROGRAM UNIVERSE is a computational model which can be explored empirically in commercial database transactions {{where there has been}} a wealth of activity over the real world for the last 40 years.

40|$|EventSpaces is {{a web-based}} {{collaborative}} teaching environment we developed for our elective CAAD course. Its {{goal is to}} let the students collectively design a prototypical application - the EventSpaces. Game. The work students do to produce this game {{and the process of}} how they interact is actually a game in its own right. It is a process that is enabled by the EventSpaces. System, which combines work, learning, competition and play in a shared virtual environment. The EventSpaces. System allows students to criticize, evaluate, and rate each otheri•s contributions, thereby distributing the authorship credits of the game. The content of the game is therefore created in a collaborative as well as competitive manner. In the EventSpaces. System, the students form a community that shares a common interest {{in the development of the}} EventSpaces. Game. At the same time they are competing to secure as much credit as possible for themselves. This playful incentive in turn helps to improve the overall quality of the EventSpaces. Game, which is in the interest of all authors. This whole, rather intricate functionality, which also includes a messaging system for all EventSpaces activities, is achieved by means of a database driven online working environment that manages and displays all works produced. It preserves and showcases each authori•s contributions in relation to the whole and allows for the emergence of coherence from the multiplicity of solutions. This Paper first presents the motivation for the project and gives a <b>short</b> <b>technical</b> <b>summary</b> of how the project was implemented. Then it describes the nature of the exercises and discusses possible implications that this approach to collaboration and teaching might have. ...|$|E
