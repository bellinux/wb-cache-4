5|$|Dieselisation {{occurred}} from 1951 {{with the}} F class shunter, but the B and S classes of 1952 and 1957 revolutionised main line operations. They were then {{followed by the}} T and Y classes in 1955 and 1963 which displaced <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> the branch lines and yards. Apart from the F class, Clyde Engineering has had a monopoly on Victorian diesel-electric locos. as the Australian licensee of General Motors EMD engines and traction motors, fitting them into locally designed bodies. By the 1980s the first generation locomotives were approaching {{the end of their}} lives, with the electric locomotives withdrawn by 1988, and the modern N and G classes allowing the withdrawal of lower power T and Y classes.|$|E
5|$|The main {{improvement}} in engine performance during the pre-dreadnought period {{came from the}} adoption of increasingly higher pressure <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> the boiler. Scotch marine boilers were superseded by more compact water-tube boilers, allowing higher-pressure steam to be produced with less fuel consumption. Water-tube boilers were also safer, with less risk of explosion, and more flexible than fire-tube types. The Belleville-type water-tube boiler had been introduced in the French fleet as early as 1879, but it took until 1894 for the Royal Navy to adopt it for armoured cruisers and pre-dreadnoughts; other water-tube boilers followed in navies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} of a similar design to other local power {{stations}} at Carville and Lemington, and was a large triple-gabled brick building. However Dunston A was built several years after the other local stations, and so because of advances in power station design, was larger {{and was able to}} produce more electricity than the others. The station was originally equipped with two turbo-alternators rated at 7.2megawatts (MW), made by AEG of Germany, and two turbo alternators rated at 6.25MW and 13.2MW, made by Brown Boveri of Switzerland, for a total generating capacity of 33.85MW. The turbo alternators were supplied with <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> 24coal burning Babcock & Wilcox marine water-tube boilers.|$|E

5|$|Sites at Watts Bar Dam, Muscle Shoals and Detroit were considered, but it {{was decided}} to build it at the Clinton Engineer Works, where water could be {{obtained}} from the Clinch River and <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> the K-25 power house. The thermal diffusion project was codenamed S-50. An S-50 Division was created at the Manhattan District headquarters in June under Lieutenant Colonel Mark C. Fox, with Major Thomas J. Evans, Jr., as his assistant with special authority for plant construction. Groves selected the H. K. Ferguson Company of Cleveland, Ohio, as the prime construction contractor on its record of finishing jobs on time, notably the Gulf Ordnance Plant in Mississippi, on a cost plus fixed fee contract. The H. A. Jones Construction Company would build the steam plant, with H. K. Ferguson as engineer-architect. Although his advisors had estimated that it would take six months to build the plant, Groves gave H. K. Ferguson just four, and he wanted operations to commence in just 75 days.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{efficiency}} of geothermal electric plants is low, around 10–23%, because geothermal fluids do {{not reach the}} high temperatures of <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> boilers. The laws of thermodynamics limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy. Exhaust heat is wasted, unless {{it can be used}} directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. System efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel, but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles. Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its capacity factor can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated. The global average was 73% in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Schichau {{class were}} torpedo boats {{built for the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy between 1885 and 1891. A total of 22 boats were built by three {{shipbuilding}} companies; nine by Seearsenal Pola, six by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino, and the remaining seven boats were built by Schichau-Werke. The class {{was one of the}} first torpedo boat classes built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and they were initially powered by <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> a single locomotive boiler. The entire class was reconstructed between 1900 and 1910, when they received two Yarrow boilers and a second funnel. Ten of the class were converted to minesweepers between 1911 and 1913, and apart from one that was discarded in 1911, all boats saw active service as part of local defence forces for Adriatic naval bases during World War I, with one being lost in the early days of the war. The remaining nine torpedo boats were also converted to minesweepers in 1917, although five still carried torpedoes. After the war, sixteen were allocated to Italy and four were allocated to the navy of the newly created Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia). Except for one of the Yugoslav boats which was retained as a training vessel, all of the boats had been discarded and broken up by 1925. After capture during the April 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia the remaining boat saw service with the Italians then the Germans during World War II. She was lost in German hands sometime after September 1943.|$|E

25|$|In {{the nuclear}} power plants called {{pressurized}} water reactors, special large heat exchangers pass heat from the primary (reactor plant) system to the secondary (steam plant) system, producing <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> water in the process. These are called steam generators. All fossil-fueled and nuclear power plants using steam-driven turbines have surface condensers to convert the exhaust <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> the turbines into condensate (water) for re-use.|$|E
25|$|Power {{plants that}} use steam-driven {{turbines}} commonly use heat exchangers to boil water into steam. Heat exchangers or similar units for producing <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> water are often called boilers or steam generators.|$|E

50|$|Resuming cargo {{runs out}} of Japanese ports, Herkimer {{remained}} in the Western Pacific since 1955. Cargo operations have sent her primarily to Inchon, Pusan, and other South Korean ports; and she has made numerous cargo runs along the Japanese coast from Wakkanai and Hakodate, Hokkaido, to Kagoshima and Nagasaki, Kyūshū. In addition she has <b>steamed</b> <b>from</b> Korea to Southeast Asia while supporting America's determination to maintain peace and contain Communism in the Far East. She has <b>steamed</b> <b>from</b> ports in Japan and the Philippine Islands, transporting military supplies to Formosa between 1961 and 1965.|$|R
25|$|The {{condenser}} condenses the <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> {{the exhaust}} of the turbine into liquid {{to allow it}} to be pumped. If the condenser can be made cooler, the pressure of the exhaust steam is reduced and efficiency of the cycle increases.|$|E

25|$|The company {{decided in}} 1960 to {{increase}} its paper production dramatically. PM4 started operations in 1963 in a fully integrated production line manufacturing supercalender magazine paper, with an annual production of 50,000 tonnes. This involved the installation of a new lumber cleaning and chopping mill, a new pulp mill, a new boiler system and a new water pipe from Femsjøen. <b>Steam</b> <b>from</b> the Halden Reactor {{was used in the}} paper machines. Saugbrugsforeningen thus became the first paper mill in the world to derive <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> nuclear power. Investments from 1958 to 1963 cost NOK165 million. By 1964 the company was producing 130,000 tonnes annually of various paper grades, up four-fold since 1950. The company had 3,000 employees, of which about 1,000 worked in the forests.|$|E
25|$|At each {{stroke the}} warm {{condensate}} was drawn {{off from the}} condenser and sent to a hot well by a vacuum pump, which also helped to evacuate the <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> under the power cylinder. The still-warm condensate was recycled as feedwater for the boiler.|$|E
25|$|After the tsunami, the {{isolation}} condenser {{should have taken}} over {{the function of the}} cooling pumps, by condensing the <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> the pressure vessel into water to be used for cooling the reactor. However, the condenser did not function properly and TEPCO could not confirm whether a valve was opened.|$|E

25|$|In {{the age of}} steam, {{the steam}} calliope was {{particularly}} used on riverboats and in circuses. In both cases, a steam supply was already available for other purposes. Riverboats supplied <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> their propulsion boilers. Circus calliopes were sometimes installed in steam-drive carousels, or supplied with <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> a traction engine. The traction engine could also supply electric power for lighting, and tow the calliope in the circus parade, where it traditionally came last. Other circus calliopes were self-contained, mounted on a carved, painted and gilded wagon pulled by horses, but {{the presence of other}} steam boilers in the circus meant that fuel and expertise to run the boiler were readily available. Steam instruments often had keyboards made from brass. This was in part to resist the heat and moisture of the steam, but also for the golden shine of the highly polished keys.|$|E
25|$|A {{cooling system}} removes {{heat from the}} reactor core and {{transports}} it to another area of the station, where the thermal energy can be harnessed to produce electricity or to do other useful work. Typically the hot coolant {{is used as a}} heat source for a boiler, and the pressurized <b>steam</b> <b>from</b> that drives one or more steam turbine driven electrical generators.|$|E
