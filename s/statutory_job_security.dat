Using 39 consecutive annual household-surveys from Chile, we find that <b>job</b> <b>security</b> is associated with a substantial decline in the wage employment-to-population rate of young workers. In contrast, we do not find such a decline in young self-employment rates or in the wage employment rates of older workers.

The analysis of migrants' satisfaction with <b>job</b> <b>security</b> is particularly important in an Australian labour market environment given that it is increasingly dominated by non-permanent jobs and migrant workers. The descriptive statistics indicate a significant difference in satisfaction with <b>job</b> <b>security</b> between migrant and native workers. Linear and ordered probit regressions are invoked to examine whether or not being a migrant has a negative impact on <b>job</b> <b>security</b> satisfaction levels after controlling for key socio-demographic, human capital and labour market characteristics and these regressions are conducted separately for male and female workers. The role of expectations in affecting one's satisfaction with <b>job</b> <b>security</b> is also explored. The model findings indicate that being a female migrant worker has a significant negative impact of <b>job</b> <b>security</b> satisfaction but the impact is insignificant for males.

For coaches to perform at the optimal level they need, among other things, to be provided with appropriate training and development opportunities to develop their skills, adequate compensation which will lead to greater job satisfaction, organizational commitment and <b>job</b> <b>security.</b> The sport organization therefore needs to shape and align its HRM system to suit the needs of coaches so that it can attract, nurture and retain one of its most precious resources - the sport coach. The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the relationship between <b>job</b> <b>security,</b> compensation and training among professional sport coaches in South Africa. A quantitative research approach was used for the study. A non-probability convenience sampling method was used to recruit a sample of human resources managers for the study. A two-section structured questionnaire was developed to collect data from potential participants in all provinces in South Africa. Frequencies were used to report on the demographic data and correlations and regressions were used to report on the relationship between <b>job</b> <b>security,</b> training and compensation of sport coaches. A positive practical significant relationship was found between training and compensation (medium effect).
