The analysis of migrants' satisfaction with <b>job</b> <b>security</b> is particularly important in an Australian labour market environment given that it is increasingly dominated by non-permanent jobs and migrant workers. The descriptive statistics indicate a significant difference in satisfaction with <b>job</b> <b>security</b> between migrant and native workers. Linear and ordered probit regressions are invoked to examine whether or not being a migrant has a negative impact on <b>job</b> <b>security</b> satisfaction levels after controlling for key socio-demographic, human capital and labour market characteristics and these regressions are conducted separately for male and female workers. The role of expectations in affecting one's satisfaction with <b>job</b> <b>security</b> is also explored. The model findings indicate that being a female migrant worker has a significant negative impact of <b>job</b> <b>security</b> satisfaction but the impact is insignificant for males.

Frequencies were used to report on the demographic data and correlations and regressions were used to report on the relationship between <b>job</b> <b>security,</b> training and compensation of sport coaches. A positive practical significant relationship was found between training and compensation (medium effect).
