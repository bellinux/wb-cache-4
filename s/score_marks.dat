5000|$|Grade Score Marking (GSM) {{was also}} {{introduced}} in 2011, {{along with the}} realigned level one standards. Like the realignment, GSM was phased in so that only level one externals were marked with GSM in 2011. Under GSM each question earns up to 8 marks, with two marks per each of the grades (NAME). N0 also exists for [...] "no response, no evidence". The Grade <b>Score</b> <b>Marks</b> for each question are totalled and the overall mark for the standard is determined from that total, based on NZQA determined cut-scores. However, candidates would still ultimately receive one of four marks (NAME) {{whether or not the}} standard (such as 91098) was out of eight or 32 (for example, 90948). The rationale behind the change was threefold: it would clarify marks for candidates, motivate them to improve and improve consistency in marking. In 2013, the phased entry of GSM was completed.|$|E
50|$|The {{decline of}} Homotherium {{could be a}} result of the {{disappearance}} of large herbivorous mammals like mammoths in America {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene. In North America fossil remains of Homotherium are less abundant than those of its contemporary Smilodon. For the most part it probably inhabited higher latitudes and altitudes and therefore was likely to be well adapted to the colder conditions of the mammoth steppe environment. Reduced claws, relatively slender limbs and the sloping back indicate adaptations for endurance running in open habitats. African species of Homotherium also seem to have hunted early Pleistocene species of Deinotherium, likely targeting the adolescents or calves in a herd. Due to its saber-teeth, the attack of such thick-skinned prey would have been relatively easier and much quicker a kill, as opposed to a similar hunt on modern elephants by lions, which take significantly longer than machairodonts to bring down such large targets. At the famous site that is Friesenhahn Cave, Texas, the remains of almost 400 juvenile mammoths were discovered along with skeletons of numerous Homotherium including adults, elderly animals and cubs. Homotherium groups have been, based on this fossil site, suggested to have specialized in hunting young mammoths and to have dragged the kills into secluded caves to eat out of the open. Homotherium also seemed to have retained excellent nocturnal vision like most cats, and hunting at night in the arctic regions where many Homotherium have been found would probably have been a prime hunting method. The sloped back and powerful lumbar section of Homotherium's vertebrae suggested a bear-like build, so it might have been capable of pulling heavy weight, and the potential risk breaking canines, a fate suffered by other machairodonts such as Machairodus and Smilodon with some frequency due to struggling with prey, is not seen in Homotherium. Moreover, the bones of the young mammoths found in Friesenhahn Cave show distinctive marks matching the incisors of Homotherium, indicating they could efficiently process most of the meat on a carcass and strip flesh from bone in a manner leaving noticeable <b>score</b> <b>marks,</b> indicating it was they and not scavengers who dragged the carcasses into the caves as has been suggested in the past. Examination of the bones also indicates that the carcasses of these juvenile mammoths were dismembered after being killed by the cats before being dragged away, indicating that Homotherium would disarticulate their kill to transport it to a safe area such as a hidden lair or den and prevent scavengers such as dire wolves and American lions from claiming a hard-won meal. Evidence also shows the cats were able to effectively strip flesh from bone in a manner that left noticeable <b>score</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|E
50|$|If {{the modern}} lion is capable of, in large numbers, killing {{weakened}} adult and healthy subadult elephants, similar sized Homotherium likely could have managed the same feat with juvenile mammoths. This {{is supported by}} isotopic analysis. But {{the idea that a}} cat, even one of very large size and possibly social, was able to cooperatively 'drag' a 400-pound mammoth calf any real distance into a cave without damaging its teeth has aroused great criticism. Its sloped back and powerful lumbar section of its vertebrae suggested a bear-like build, so it might have been capable of pulling weights, but breaking canines, a fate suffered by Machairodus and Smilodon with some frequency, is not seen in Homotherium. Moreover, the bones of these young mammoths show the distinctive marks of Homotherium incisors, indicating they could efficiently process most of the meat on a carcass, indicating it was they and not scavengers who dragged the carcasses into the caves. Examination of the bones also indicates that the carcasses of these mammoths were dismembered by the cats before being dragged away, indicating that Homotherium would disarticulate their kill to transport it to a safe area and prevent scavengers from claiming a hard-won meal.
