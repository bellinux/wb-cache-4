Moreover, multigigabit signals will also generate large amounts of heat far exceeding today’s parallel VME designs.

Initial VXS and VPX products are targeted at performance-driven DSP and multiprocessing applications, having lots of digital signal processors, FPGAs, multicore, and/ or Cell processors.

40|$|Issues {{users have}} {{with use of}} the web on a mobile device can be {{attributed}} to difficulties with the mobile interface. A major challenge that we address is improving the user experience for handling of interruptions and multitasking when using the web in a mobile context. The usability issues with a mobile device (e. g. intensive navigation) {{is directly related to the}} negative impact on user performance, described as cognitive overhead related to attention and memory. There is a lack of addressing attention and memory in relationship to the user interface and user performance during use of a mobile device. Also lacking is interface support for users when doing more than one task. We proposed a form of mobile assistance, an Attentive Interface for Mobile Multitasking (AIMM) that aids users with managing interruptions by dynamically adapting forms of support to facilitate attention and memory for a task. This research contributes to building a conceptual, empirical and theoretical foundation for designing mobile assistance. These issues were addressed empirically by examining how people use the mobile Web and handle interruptions that result in multitasking. In conceptualizing mobile assistance, a multitasking and interruption framework was developed to identify aspects of the user, tasks, context, mobile device and user performance that are relevant to user handling of interruptions. This multitasking framework was a basis to developing assistance support when handling interruption tasks on a mobile device. Three experiments were presented, on understanding the influence of an interruption task on user web task performance. A fourth experiment is presented on the use of visual markers such as an automated point of return indicator (PRI) and a user controlled interactive suspension point (ISP) to support a user with resuming a primary task after an interruption. Based on our research we conclude the following: An interruption task generated from the same device (same origin) having similar interactions (e. g. pointing with a stylus or mouse cursor and entering information on screens) with a single screen display leads to <b>serial</b> <b>switching</b> between tasks that negatively influences user performance. We have attributed delays on interrupted primary task performance to the following: disruption in memory for recalling where to begin the task, memory decay and interference (e. g. from <b>serial</b> <b>switching</b> and similarity in interaction between tasks) which negatively impacts working memory, leading to confusion and difficulty in reconfiguring a task for resumption. Our interaction design recommendations include assistance for use of the mobile Web when multitasking with interruptions. As part of the Attentive Interface for Mobile Multitasking framework, assistance is needed for supporting the user's attention and memory (e. g. PRI and ISP) on the primary task. User handling of the interruption task can be improved by enhancing user anticipation of an interruption. Interceding of an interruption task is also recommended in the form of content summarization of a message. Furthermore, the assistance of interruption management itself needs to be understood and appropriately adapted to the user. Mobile assistance for interruption management is a means toward improving usability of the mobile Web...|$|R

40|$|Working {{memory is}} the {{fundamental}} component of cognition {{that allows us to}} temporarily maintain information needed for concurrent processing. An existing theory from the literature, the time-based resource-sharing (TBRS) model, posits that working memory is a <b>serial,</b> rapidly <b>switching,</b> attentional refreshing mechanism. While others have sought previously to formalize the TBRS model into a computational process model, I go further, using ACT-R to model the influence of working memory on an entire task from end to end.

These efforts reveal that areas not traditionally associated with working memory research directly, particularly item representation and response strategy, are necessary assumptions of any such process model despite being underspecified in TBRS and other theories.

40|$|Clustered {{mutations}} may be {{broadly defined}} {{as the presence of}} two or more mutations within a spatially localized genomic region on a single chromosome. Known instances vary in terms of both the number and type of the component mutations, ranging from two closely spaced point mutations to tens or even hundreds of genomic rearrangements. Although clustered mutations can represent the observable net result of independent lesions sequentially acquired over multiple cell cycles, they can also be generated in a simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous manner within a single cell cycle. This review focuses on those mechanisms known to underlie the latter type. Both gene conversion and transient hypermutability are capable of generating closely spaced multiple mutations. However, a recently described phenomenon in human cancer cells, known as 'chromothripsis', has provided convincing evidence that tens to hundreds of genomic rearrangements can sometimes be generated simultaneously via a single catastrophic event. The distinctive genomic features observed in the derivative chromosomes, together with the highly characteristic junction sequences, point to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) as being the likely underlying mutational mechanism. By contrast, replication-based mechanisms such as microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) which involves serial replication slippage or <b>serial</b> template <b>switching</b> probably account for those complex genomic rearrangements that comprise multiple duplications and/or triplications...|$|R
