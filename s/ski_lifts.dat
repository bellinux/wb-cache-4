5|$|By far {{the largest}} form of winter {{recreation}} is skiing. As of 1994, of the estimated 65–75 million skiers worldwide, there were approximately 55 million who engaged in Alpine skiing, the rest engaged in cross-country skiing. Approximately 30 million skiers (of all kinds) were in Europe, 15 million in the US, and 14 million in Japan. As of 1996, there were reportedly 4,500 ski areas, operating 26,000 <b>ski</b> <b>lifts</b> and enjoying 390 million skier visits per year. The preponderant region for downhill skiing was Europe, followed by Japan and the US.|$|E
5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using <b>ski</b> <b>lifts</b> or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E
5|$|Skiing {{associations}} subsequently {{contend that}} {{veterans of the}} 10th Mountain Division had a substantial effect in the post-World War II development of skiing as a vacation industry and major sport. Ex-soldiers from the 10th laid out ski hills, designed <b>ski</b> <b>lifts,</b> became ski coaches, racers, instructors, patrollers, shop owners, and filmmakers. They wrote and published ski magazines, opened ski schools, improved ski equipment, and developed ski resorts. Up to 2,000 of the division's troops were involved in skiing-related professions after the war, and at least 60 ski resorts were founded by men of the division.|$|E

5000|$|At the 1971 International Design Conference at Aspen, Kaprow {{directed}} a happening called [...] "Tag" [...] on the Aspen Highlands <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> {{which focused on}} one of the conference themes: [...] "the technological revolution". Using five video cameras and monitors, he recorded people riding the <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> and again as they watched themselves riding the <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> on the monitors.|$|R

25|$|According to Scientific American, <b>ski</b> <b>lifts</b> {{and trains}} tracks are among places being {{considered}} to store energy by moving heavy objects {{up or down}} inclines.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{ski resorts}} on Etna: {{one at the}} Sapienza Refuge, with a {{chairlift}} and three <b>ski</b> <b>lifts,</b> and a smaller one on the north, at Piano Provenzana near Linguaglossa, with three lifts and a chairlift.|$|E
25|$|Together {{with the}} pistes and <b>ski</b> <b>lifts</b> in {{neighbouring}} Kirchberg in Tirol, Jochberg {{and by the}} Thurn Pass Kitzbühel {{is one of the}} largest ski regions in Austria. With around 10,000 hotel and guest house beds, Kitzbühel and its neighbours have an unusually high density of guest accommodation.|$|E
50|$|In 1948, a <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> {{was erected}} on Mount Tengu, near Kusatsu. It {{was the first}} <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> in Japan, with Kusatsu going on {{to become one of}} the country's first proper ski resorts.|$|R
50|$|There was at {{one point}} a <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> on the mountain, but later, due to the {{inconsistency}} of snowfall, the lift was removed. Remains of the <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> mechanism are still visible to hikers on the east peak trail.|$|R
50|$|The friends {{convince}} the <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> attendant {{to let them}} on one last time. Before the group gets {{all the way to}} the top, the attendant is called into the boss's office and is replaced by a co-worker. As he leaves, he tells the co-worker that there are only three skiers left. Another set of three skiers comes down the mountain. When he sees them, he shuts down the <b>ski</b> <b>lift,</b> stranding the three friends in their <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> chair far above the ground.|$|R
25|$|Hopkins Rides is WhiteWater West's latest acquisition. The {{company began}} in 1962 as a {{manufacturer}} of <b>ski</b> <b>lifts</b> before moving into log flumes, water rides, steel roller coasters and ropes courses. Since filing for bankruptcy in 2001, the company simplified its product offering, reverting to solely water ride manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|The skiing {{ranges from}} easy, {{beginner}} slopes {{to some of}} the most dangerous, expert, black diamond slopes on the east coast of the United States. There are four <b>ski</b> <b>lifts</b> at the park, each of which stops at a different elevation on the slopes. Lift-accessed Snow tubing is also available at Denton Hill State Park, or Ski Denton.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} ski resorts have adopted RFID tags to provide skiers {{hands-free}} access to <b>ski</b> <b>lifts.</b> Skiers {{do not have}} to take their passes out of their pockets. Ski jackets have a left pocket into which the chip+card fits. This nearly contacts the sensor unit on the left of the turnstile as the skier pushes through to the lift. These systems were based on high frequency (HF) at 13.56 megahertz. The bulk of ski areas in Europe, from Verbier to Chamonix use these systems.|$|E

50|$|The company's {{first major}} project was the <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> system in 2003 built with the Italian company Graffer Seggiovie, and the {{chairlift}} system in 2006 built at ski resort on Mount Davraz in Isparta before building mostly <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> lines in domestic <b>ski</b> resorts. Aerial <b>lifts</b> constructed {{in many places}} of Turkey followed as Keçiören Gondola in Ankara (2007), Muş <b>Ski</b> <b>Lift</b> (2008), Aydın Gondola (2008), Kars Sarıkamış Chairlift and Kars Çamurlu T-bar lift (2009), Erzincan Mt. Ergan Chairlift (2010), Van Gevaş Abalı Chairlift (2011), Çankırı-Ilgaz Chairlift (2012), Hakkari-Merga Büte (2012). STM constructed the Balakən Gondola in 2007 as the first aerial lift of Azerbaycan.|$|R

25|$|In 1981, {{a couple}} of Winterstick team riders went to France at the {{invitation}} of Alain Gaimard, marketing director at Les Arcs. After seeing an early film of this event, French skiers/surfers Augustin Coppey, Olivier Lehaneur, Olivier Roland and Antoine Yarmola made their first successful attempts during the winter of 1983 in France (Val Thorens), using primitive, home-made clones of the Winterstick. Starting with pure powder, skateboard-shaped wooden-boards equipped with aluminium fins, foot-straps and leashes, their technology evolved within a few years to pressed wood/fiber composite boards fitted with polyethylene soles, steel edges and modified ski boot shells. These were more suitable for the mixed conditions encountered while snowboarding mainly off-piste, but having to get back to <b>ski</b> <b>lifts</b> on packed snow.|$|E
25|$|Both {{northern}} and {{southern part of the}} voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt. Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 <b>ski</b> <b>lifts</b> and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk, Brenna, Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska. The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa - the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski). Along Odra river are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming.|$|E
25|$|When falling, skiers in {{this class}} with above the knee amputations are taught {{to try to prevent}} the stump of their leg from hitting the snow as it can cause more damage to that leg than the one that is not {{partially}} missing. When working on side stepping, the skier is supported to keep the stump of their leg on the uphill side. Elite skiers are taught to avoid using outriggers as crutches. Skiers are taught to turn using their leg instead of their ski poles. Skiers {{in this class}} can use the outrigger to assist in maintaining their balance as they turn on the hill. A skier with an above the knee amputation may have a better ability to complete turns on the opposite of their amputation. In getting on <b>ski</b> <b>lifts,</b> skiers with above the knee amputations in this classification should lift their outriggers off the ground and point them forward.|$|E

Two were {{executed}} by the Syrians after their capture, thirty-one were taken prisoner. Syrian casualties were fifteen killed (twelve commandos and three helicopter crewmen) and three officers wounded trying to penetrate the outpost. The Syrians captured the outpost, the lower <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> and the entire Hermon mountainside.|$|R

500|$|The Santa Fe National Forest's rocky {{terrain and}} steep {{inclines}} proved difficult for conventional camera equipment—such as cranes and dollies—which resulted {{in much of}} the film's scenes being shot by the camera operators, who were rigged to aerial <b>ski</b> <b>lifts</b> above the action. [...] "The location we picked was on top of the ski area above 12,000 feet in Santa Fe, and the high altitude made it extremely physically demanding", Schleissler explained. [...] "All our equipment had to be hand-carried into some of our remote locations, which meant we had to limit ourselves to the bare minimum...No one ever hiked to the set empty-handed, including our producers. It was one big team effort that made us a close film family." ...|$|E
