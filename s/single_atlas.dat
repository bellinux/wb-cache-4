40|$|International audiencePurpose:To {{present a}} method to enrich atlases for atlas based segmentation. Such enriched atlases can then {{be used as a}} <b>single</b> <b>atlas</b> or within a multiatlas framework. Methods:In this paper, machine {{learning}} techniques have been used to enhance the atlas based segmentation approach. The enhanced atlas defined in this work is a pair composed of a gray level image alongside an image of multiclass classifiers with one classifier per voxel. Each classifier embeds local information from the whole training dataset that allows for the correction of some systematic errors in the segmentation and accounts for the possible local registration errors. The authors also propose to use these images of classifiers within a multiatlas framework: results produced by a set of such local classifier atlases can be combined using a label fusion method. Results:Experiments have been made on the in vivoimages of the IBSR dataset and a comparison has been made with several state-of-the-art methods such as FreeSurfer and the multiatlas nonlocal patch based method of Coupé or Rousseau. These experiments show that their method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods while having a low computational cost. Further enhancement has also been obtained with a multiatlas version of their method. It is also shown that, in this case, nonlocal fusion is unnecessary. The multiatlas fusion can therefore be done efficiently. Conclusions:The <b>single</b> <b>atlas</b> version has similar quality as state-of-the-arts multiatlas methods but with the computational cost of a naive <b>single</b> <b>atlas</b> segmentation.

The primary purpose of this work is to investigate and quantify segmentation quality changes introduced by such linked registrations. We also determine the optimal parameters for fusing linked multi-atlas labels using probabilistic weighted fusion. Material and methods: Computed tomography images of 10 head and neck cancer patients were used as atlases, with parotid glands, submandibular glands, the mandible and lymph node levels II-IV segmented by an experienced radiation oncologist following published consensus guidelines. The change in segmentation quality scored by Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for linking free-form deformable registrations, modeled by B-splines, was investigated for both single-and multi-atlas label fusion by using a leave-one-out approach. Results: The median decrease of the DSC was in the range 2. 8 % to 8. 4 % compared to direct registrations for all structures while reducing the computer calculation time {{to that of a}} single deformable registration. Linking several registrations showed a DSC decrease almost linear to the number of links, suggesting that extrapolation to zero links provides an observer independent measure of the inherent precision with which the segmentation guidelines can be applied.

40|$|Background: Semi-automated {{segmentation}} using {{deformable registration}} of selected atlas cases consisting of expert segmented patient images {{has been proposed}} to facilitate the delineation of lymph node regions for three-dimensional conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning of head and neck and prostate tumours. Our aim is to investigate if fusion of multiple atlases will lead to clinical workload reductions and more accurate segmentation proposals {{compared to the use}} of a <b>single</b> <b>atlas</b> segmentation, due to a more complete representation of the anatomical variations. Methods: Atlases for lymph node regions were constructed using 11 head and neck patients and 15 prostate patients based on published recommendations for segmentations. A commercial registration software (Velocity AI) was used to create individual segmentations through deformable registration. Ten head and neck patients, and ten prostate patients, all different from the atlas patients, were randomly chosen for the study from retrospective data. Each patient was first delineated three times, (a) manually by a radiation oncologist, (b) automatically using a <b>single</b> <b>atlas</b> segmentation proposal from a chosen atlas and (c) automatically by fusing the atlas proposals from all cases in the database using the probabilistic weighting fusion algorithm. In a subsequent step a radiation oncologist corrected the segmentation proposals achieved from step (b) and (c) without using the result from method (a) as reference. The time spent for editing the segmentations was recorded separately for each method and for each individual structure. Finally, the Dice Similarity Coefficient and the volume of the structures were used to evaluate the similarity between the structures delineated with the different methods. Results: For the <b>single</b> <b>atlas</b> method, the time reduction compared to manual segmentation was 29 % and 23 % for head and neck and pelvis lymph nodes, respectively, while editing the fused atlas proposal resulted in time reductions of 49 % and 34 %. The average volume of the fused atlas proposals was only 74 % of the manual segmentation for the head and neck cases and 82 % for the prostate cases due to a blurring effect from the fusion process. After editing of the proposals the resulting volume differences were no longer statistically significant, although a slight influence by the proposals could be noticed since the average edited volume was still slightly smaller than the manual segmentation, 9 % and 5 %, respectively. Conclusions: Segmentation based on fusion of multiple atlases reduces the time needed for delineation of lymph node regions compared to the use of a <b>single</b> <b>atlas</b> segmentation.

METHODS: High-resolution 7 T 2 DT 2 MR images of 12 Sprague-Dawley rat brains were manually segmented into 27 -VOI label volumes using detailed protocols. Automated methods were developed with 7 / 12 atlas datasets, i. e. the MRIs and their associated label volumes.

Three automated methods were tested: 1 /registering individual MRIs to the template, and using a <b>single</b> <b>atlas</b> (SA), 2 /using the maximum probability atlas (MP), and 3 /registering the MRIs from the multi-atlas dataset to an individual MRI, propagating the label volumes and fusing them in individual MRI space (propagation & fusion, PF).

We reconstruct and quantify canine cardiac architecture in selected regions of the left and right ventricular free walls and the inter-ventricular septum. Fibre inclination angle rotates smoothly through the wall in all regions, from positive in the endocardium to negative in the epicardium.
