2500|$|A {{key part}} of FBA {{is the ability to}} add {{constraints}} to the flux rates <b>of</b> <b>reactions</b> within networks, forcing them to stay within a range of selected values. This lets the model more accurately simulate real metabolism. The constraints belong to two subsets from a biological perspective; boundary constraints that limit nutrient uptake/excretion and internal constraints that limit the flux through reactions within the organism. [...] In mathematical terms, the application of constraints can be considered to reduce the solution space of the FBA model. In addition to constraints applied at the edges of a metabolic network, constraints can be applied to reactions deep within the network. These constraints are usually simple; they may constrain the direction <b>of</b> a <b>reaction</b> due to energy considerations or constrain the maximum <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> a <b>reaction</b> due to the finite <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> all <b>reactions</b> in nature.|$|R

The size of this interval is determined by the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> of the auction participants, and as such these data are collectible due to neurological constraints on information processing. The data on losing bids are shown to be informative on the structural model determinants. The models are estimated using the Gibbs sampler with data augmentation. We take account of data limitations concerning the number of bidders. The estimation results are used to investigate whether actual reserve prices are optimal, and to determine the effects of reserve price changes. data augmentation; first-price auction; Gibbs sampling; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; observing losing bids; private value; reserve price; <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction...</b>|$|E

The propensity of firms to react to these potential payoffs is considered as involving four sequential stages and determined by organizational characteristics. The findings suggest: (i) follower firms vary in the rate at which they ultimately move through each and all of the stages identified; (ii) there is evidence that firm characteristics, time and previous entry (although not simply) impact upon the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> market entry by firms reflecting the various influences on payoffs identified; and (iii) <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> are related to firms' abilities to internalize external market development...|$|R
