500|$|People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's something I {{wanted to talk about}} ... and it's something that has happened to me in the past... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E
500|$|... "Night of Your Life" [...] {{was written}} by Cristyle Johnson, Anthony Preston, David Guetta and Giorgio Tuinfort, whilst {{production}} of the song was helmed by Guetta and Tuinfort. In an interview with Akshay Bhansali of MTV News, Guetta revealed {{that he did not}} know Hudson before collaborating on the song, saying, [...] "I had heard her voice [...] and I fell in love with it. It's a difficult song. You need a really big voice to be able to perform that song. I was like, 'Whoa!' <b>She</b> <b>obviously</b> has an amazing voice, and I think it was a really interesting exercise for her and for me." [...] Guetta further explained that when he collaborates with artists, he likes to [...] "take them out of their boxes", and creating a dance record with Hudson was [...] "really exciting" [...] for him. On working with Hudson, he said, [...] "She is beautiful in every way: as a person, as a singer, as a human being. She delivered [...] like crazy." [...] "Night of Your Life" [...] was released for digital download on August 22, 2011, as the third and final promotional single from the album, as part of the iTunes Store's countdown to the album's release.|$|E
500|$|Kathy Iandoli of Idolator {{highlighted}} [...] "I Am" [...] as a [...] "gorgeous standout" [...] {{example of}} Lewis' ability to [...] "just [...] " [...] a song {{as opposed to}} using auto-tune on [...] "Power" [...] and over-singing on [...] "I Got You". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy felt that the track put [...] "Simon [...] in his place in a way Louis Walsh could only dream of." [...] Brad O'Mance for Popjustice likened the song to Massive Attack's 1991 song [...] "Unfinished Sympathy" [...] "with a different song on top", while Official Charts Company writer Rob Copsey described it as [...] "gutsy and uplifting". However, Michael Clemons of The Daily Reveille thought that while {{it was not a}} stand out track, it was a good listen. Chuck Campbell of Knoxville News Sentinel thought that the track's lyrical theme, and the album's theme as a whole, was flawed as a concept, writing [...] "The problem with repeatedly declaring you don’t need the approval of someone who has wronged you is that your message is false. Clearly if Lewis indulges in six straight bitter songs about defiantly rebounding from a bad relationship (which she does on “I Am”), <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> craves validation from the very person (or people) who did her dirty." ...|$|E
5000|$|Anya is seen {{cleaning}} up the debris from the Magic Box following the events of [...] "Grave". When she meets Willow, <b>she's</b> <b>obviously</b> very angry with her.|$|R
50|$|Lamotte {{is also an}} author, {{writing a}} weekly column for the Ici weekly {{newspaper}} and a monthly article for the Fugues gay and lesbian newsmagazine. In 2000, she published a collection of her columns entitled Tu vois ben qu'est folle (<b>She's</b> <b>obviously</b> crazy).|$|R
60|$|She frowned a little. <b>She</b> was <b>obviously</b> unused {{to being}} contradicted.|$|R
500|$|Olivia became {{concerned}} about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You {{told me you were}} prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. or whether you wd rather do it in your own way.... I don't know if she still considers herself engaged to you—but <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> can't marry you—it's hardly decent! There's another point too—which is the personal inconvenience & bother to myself—I had all last winter, practically to keep 2 days a week for you to come & see her... She must marry—She & I can't possibly go on living this feminine life practically à deux for ever, & we haven't money enough to separate... You ought to go away—Englishmen don't understand yr American ways, & any man who wanted to marry her wd be put off by the fact of yr friendship (or whatever you call it) with her. If you had ₤500 a year I should be delighted for you to marry her! ...|$|E
2500|$|Meredith McIver was the ghostwriter on Trump 101 {{and other}} books {{credited}} to Trump, who the Trump Organization described as [...] "an in-house staff writer" [...] for the company. McIver worked with Trump on his writings for Trump University. Trump University subsequently held the copyrights to Trump 101: The Way to Success. Other books credited to Trump and written by McIver include Trump: How to Get Rich (2004), Trump: Think Like a Billionaire (2005), Trump Never Give Up (2008), and Think Like a Champion (2009). In a 2007 lawsuit against The New York Times journalist Timothy O'Brien regarding his work about Trump, TrumpNation, Trump discussed the ghostwriting aspect of Trump 101 and How to Get Rich. During a deposition {{as part of}} the lawsuit Trump brought, he placed the fault with McIver for mistakes in both books. Regarding what Trump asserted was an inaccurate assessment of his debt, Trump said he was unaware of the matter after reading the book McIver presented to him, admitting: [...] "I read it very quickly. I didn't see it. I would have corrected it, but I didn't see it." [...] Trump said to the questioning lawyer, that he told McIver about the mistake she wrote in the book published under his name: [...] "I told the book writer about it, and <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> put it in again. She probably forgot. I would love you to question her about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 2007, after finishing with his rehabilitation, Morgan explained how the song had [...] "haunted" [...] him around and badly affected his reputation. He stated {{that it was not}} pleasant to hear a song describing him as a [...] "bad guy" [...] which [...] "millions of people have heard". He elaborated, [...] "I was bummed out. I was really upset that she would say and do those things. In any relationship, I don't think it's right to say and do those things when people break up, and <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> felt the need {{to go out there and}} make me sound like a complete a--hole ... I just refuse to lower myself to that level. But it was a painful thing and it got me down." [...] At the time of the interview, Seether's album Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces was to be released soon and speculations started arising to whether it would contain an answer song to [...] "Call Me When You're Sober"; [...] "Breakdown" [...] was initially pinpointed as a possible answer. In response to that, Morgan elaborated that the particular song was not an [...] "angry backlash" [...] and it was [...] "more universal" [...] as he was trying to be [...] "more vague and respectful". Talking about Lee's song, he mentioned how [...] "there are always two sides to every story", yet, he opted not to tell his side as [...] "hat's what the bloodthirsty want, and I don't care what the bloodthirsty want" [...] emphasizing that he [...] "didn't feel the need to write back and be mean". He added that Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces did not contain other answer songs aimed at Lee either, as [...] "I know what the expectations are for this album and that people will be looking for that Amy Lee reference, and I am trying desperately not to have any" [...] further noting how any possible references would be about another relationship he had recently terminated or inspired by other people in his life. Lee expressed [...] "no intention of hurting [...] " [...] during {{an interview}}, but noted that once the song came out without any metaphors, she wanted to keep it.|$|E
30|$|Hannah: This {{is another}} thing that she {{inspired}} me to do too… you can wear a simple white blouse and wear a chunky, funky necklace with it. <b>She’s</b> <b>obviously</b> giving a speech, but I never thought that I could wear something so girly and still be taken seriously. And she looks fantastic… So I started rocking big necklaces with black suits.|$|R
60|$|Anne Mie {{gazed down}} upon it. <b>She</b> was <b>obviously</b> making frantic efforts to {{maintain}} her self-possession.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> was <b>obviously</b> disturbed. A slight wave {{of trouble}} passed over her face. Her eyes {{failed to meet}} mine.|$|R
60|$|He was, however, {{somewhat}} {{surprised when}} one came towards {{him and he}} recognized the girl he had met at Hawick station. He had hardly expected her to claim his acquaintance, as <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> meant to do.|$|E
60|$|So averse was she to his {{appearing}} {{before the}} Queen, {{that she had}} locked the door for fear that the exuberant happiness which was in him, should cause him to precipitate a climax which <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> dreaded.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{they stood}} looking at one another for some time in {{absolute}} silence; <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> very frightened, hesitating betwixt audacity and immediate flight, and he puzzled and with a vague sense of unreality upon him, a sense as of a dream which yet had in it the pulsating vividness of life.|$|E
5000|$|I didn't {{even know}} she WAS {{going to be}} in Hulk. Had I known, I {{probably}} would have done things differently. As it was, there were thousands of readers who were not saying, [...] "Gee, they're portraying her wrong in [...] "Hulk." [...] Instead they were saying, [...] "Why should we care about her hero's journey in her own title when <b>she's</b> <b>obviously</b> gotten over her hostility toward Stark over in Hulk?" ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{face was}} very close to his, and he fancied that he could hear her teeth chattering. <b>She</b> was <b>obviously</b> terrified.|$|R
5000|$|Note: When Edith {{said she}} was 27 in a {{previous}} episode, {{it was a joke}} in the show as <b>she,</b> quite <b>obviously,</b> isn't 27.|$|R
60|$|Cartwright's face got red. Ellen {{was well}} informed; in fact, it was ominous {{that she knew}} so much. Had she not been greedy, he thought she would have kept the shares in order to vote against him, but <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> meant to sell them before the crash she {{expected}} came. If {{a number of others}} agreed with her, his retirement would be forced.|$|E
6000|$|... “If you haven’t {{turned my}} wife into a wolf,” said Colonel Hampton, “will you kindly explain {{where she has}} {{disappeared}} to, since <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> could not have gone through a locked door? I will not press you for an explanation of how a North American timber-wolf suddenly appeared in the conservatory, but I think I have some right to inquire what has become of Mrs. Hampton.” ...|$|E
60|$|My hand trembled as {{it touched}} the door-knob, but the lock yielded. Anna was {{standing}} in the middle of the room (she had heard my footsteps), an image of womanly loveliness, womanly faith, and womanly feeling. By a desperate effort, she was, however, mistress of her emotions. Though her pure soul seemed willing to fly to meet me, <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> restrained the impulse, in order to spare my nerves.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I declare, my dear Polly,' she replied, 'that I {{never even}} moved!' and as <b>she</b> was <b>obviously</b> in earnest I {{had to accept}} her word.|$|R
60|$|Stephen hesitated, but Wilhelmina {{waited for}} his reply. She had the air of one {{remotely}} interested, yet <b>she</b> waited <b>obviously</b> to hear what this young man had said.|$|R
60|$|The old stiff-necked haughtiness of {{her race}} did not desert {{her for a}} moment, even though <b>she</b> was <b>obviously</b> at a {{disadvantage}} in this instance, and had come here as a suppliant.|$|R
60|$|Lister {{was rather}} {{surprised}} to find he could not answer satisfactorily. It was not the girl's physical qualities but her emotions he had marked. He remembered the pluck with which she had struggled against the fear <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> felt, her impulsive trust when he offered help, and her relief when she got into the locomotive cab. Although he had studied her at Montreal, it was her effort to play a part that impressed him most.|$|E
6000|$|Bethune laughed. [...] "Well, he's {{given you}} a good job. But why I asked was this: if Miss Fuller's quite {{satisfied}} about you, she'll probably put her maverick brother in your charge. She came here not long ago with the object of finding out if I was suited for the post, and I imagined learned something about me in a quiet way. It was a relief when <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> decided that I wasn't the proper man. The girl has intelligence. If she had asked me, I could have recommended you." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{give you}} my word, this quite {{unforeseen}} slam simply robbed me {{of the power of}} speech. I'd been looking on myself {{in the light of the}} dashing host, and suddenly to be treated as an intruder jarred me. It wasn't, mark you, as if she had spoken in a way to suggest that she considered my presence in the place as an ordinary social call. <b>She</b> <b>obviously</b> looked on me as a cross between a burglar and the plumber's man come to fix the leak in the bathroom. It hurt her--my being there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] she said. Then {{suddenly}} she sprang to her feet. <b>She</b> was <b>obviously</b> delighted. A certain restraint {{had left her}} manner. It {{was clear that the}} news was a relief to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't see why," [...] I said, rather nettled. [...] "As far as I can remember, she didn't eat much. <b>She</b> was <b>obviously</b> upset, and it {{had taken}} her {{appetite}} away. That was only natural." ...|$|R
500|$|Evan Sawdey of PopMatters {{said that}} both [...] "Paparazzi" [...] and the earlier single [...] "Poker Face" [...] are {{comparable}} with the musical styles of first single [...] "Just Dance" [...] {{but added that}} [...] "never once {{does it feel like}} Gaga is deliberately repeating herself; instead, her faults only come from covering territory that <b>she's</b> <b>obviously</b> not prepared for." [...] Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post said that even though Gaga turns somewhat serious while disapprovingly singing [...] "Paparazzi", the song comes across as flat and faceless as well as vapid. Erika Howard of the New Times Broward-Palm Beach called it the most telling track from the album.|$|R
60|$|Foster {{stood still}} for a moment, {{overcome}} by surprise and satisfaction, but understanding what he saw. The lady with the sewing was studying him, {{but he did not}} resent this and thought he would like her. The girl divided her attention between him and his comrade, whom she restrained with a pretty air of authority. <b>She</b> <b>obviously</b> knew who Foster was and felt curious, but meant to take care of Lawrence. There was something in her protective manner that Foster found singularly charming. Then Lawrence beckoned and held out his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is the position, Mr. Forsyte. I {{can make}} pretty certain {{of her life}} if I operate, but the baby will be born dead. If I don't operate, the baby will most {{probably}} be born alive, but it's a great risk for the mother--a great risk. In either case I don't think she can ever have another child. In her state <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> can't decide for herself, and we can't wait for her mother. It's {{for you to make}} the decision, while I'm getting what's necessary. I shall be back within the hour." ...|$|E
60|$|Not long since, {{a gentleman}} whose word carried some weight at the company's office {{had visited the}} {{construction}} camp with his indulged daughter. The girl was clever, adventurous, and interested by pioneer work, and Lister had helped her to some thrills <b>she</b> <b>obviously</b> enjoyed. She had, with his guidance, driven a locomotive across a shaking, half-braced bridge, fired a heavy blasting shot, and caught big gray trout from his canoe. Although Lister used some reserve, their friendship ripened, and when she left she hinted she had some power she {{might be willing to}} use on his behalf.|$|E
60|$|After all, {{it was not}} so easy. The girl's {{eyes never}} left his face. She was civil, but <b>she</b> was <b>obviously</b> {{impatient}} to know his errand. Afraid, no doubt, he thought grimly, that her other visitor would leave.|$|R
60|$|Catherine {{was more}} heavily veiled than usual. Her dress and hat were of sombre black, and her manner nervous and disturbed. She came slowly to-wards their {{end of the}} table, {{although}} <b>she</b> was <b>obviously</b> in search of some one else.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Van Reinberg {{was looking}} across at Mr. de Valentin {{with a very}} {{determined}} expression on her pale, hard face. <b>She</b> was <b>obviously</b> {{a woman who was}} accustomed to have her own way, and meant to have it in this particular instance.|$|R
