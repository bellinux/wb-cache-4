25|$|Throughout this curriculum, Preuss {{students}} are required to take courses at the advanced placement (AP) level, when offered. This requirement is meant to improve the students' chances for college admission and {{to reduce the number of}} college courses these low-income <b>students</b> <b>might</b> later have to take and pay for. By graduation, all Preuss students will have taken at least six AP courses.|$|E
50|$|In Tier 2, {{the main}} purpose of {{progress}} monitoring is to determine whether interventions are successful in helping students learn at an appropriate rate. Decision rules are created to determine when a <b>student</b> <b>might</b> no longer require extra interventions, when the interventions need to be changed, or when a <b>student</b> <b>might</b> be identified for special education.|$|R
50|$|A {{write out}} is a {{punishment}} used in schools in which a misbehaving student must write something out. It is different from writing lines as, instead of writing something {{out a number of}} times, the <b>student</b> <b>might</b> write out a page, chapter or paragraph of their schoolbook, workbook or novel. In the case of non-written homework (spellings), the <b>student</b> <b>might</b> have to write the spellings a number of times.|$|R

25|$|Several {{separate}} {{educational systems}} eventually resulted under the Protectorate. Serving French colons and Tunisians was a {{primary and secondary}} system closely coordinated with Metropolitan France, using the French language. From here <b>students</b> <b>might</b> attend a university in France. The government also directed a modern secular system of schools using mixed French and Arabic. The kuttab primary schools remained, keeping their religious instruction, yet enhanced by arithmetic, history, French, and hygiene; taught primarily in Arabic, the kuttab received government support. Thus Zitouna Mosque <b>students</b> <b>might</b> come from either the mixed secular or the kuttab religious schools. Zitouna education continued to expand, running four-year secondary schools at Tunis, Sfax, and Gabes, and also a program at the university level, while remaining a traditional Islamic institution. Sadiki College, however, became the premier lyc√©e in the country, which offered to an emerging Tunisian elite a secular, well-developed, French-language program. These reforms {{set the stage for}} further advances made in Tunisian education since independence.|$|E
25|$|In 1859 Besant vacated his Fellowship with Saint John's {{college to}} marry Margaret Elizabeth Willis, {{daughter}} of Rev. Robert Willis, {{a professor of}} natural philosophy at Cambridge. They had two sons and a daughter. In 1863 Besant published Elementary Hydrostatics, a textbook on fluid statics containing mathematical exercises such as <b>students</b> <b>might</b> face in examination. The book was reprinted several times, and revised in 1892. He also wrote Treatise on Hydromechanics (1867) covering fluid mechanics. His book Elementary Conics came out in 1901.|$|E
25|$|In the USA, {{on average}} {{one third of}} grade A {{students}} have cheated. And asserts that academic dishonesty acts as a shortcut, so even grade A <b>students</b> <b>might</b> be tempted to cheat. He contends that even if a plagiarized paper receives a relatively low grade, that grade is actually high, given how much time and effort went into the paper. In the study mentioned above (in which students were allowed to bring crib sheets to a test but did not improve their scores), the researcher concluded that the students used the crib notes as alternatives to studying, rather than as complements to studying, and thus spent less time preparing for the exam.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the language policy for Mandarin and Malay, Indian students are given {{a wider variety of}} Indian languages to choose from. For example, Indian students speaking Dravidian languages study Tamil as a Mother Tongue. However, schools with low numbers of Tamil <b>students</b> <b>might</b> not provide Tamil language classes. As a result, students from such schools will attend Tamil language classes at the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language Centre (UPTLC). On the other hand, Indian students who speak non-Dravidian languages can choose from Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati and Urdu. However, as with Tamil, only certain schools offer these non-Dravidian languages. Thus, students will attend their respective language classes at designated language centres, held by the Board for the Teaching and Testing of South Asian Languages (BTTSAL).|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Protectorate {{the schools}} {{open to the}} {{majority}} of Tunisians were religious, e.g., the many local kuttab whose curriculum centered on the memorization and study of the Qur'an. These schools were usually proximous to the mosque and run by the imam. <b>Students</b> <b>might</b> progress to further such instruction at advanced schools. Especially noteworthy in this regard, but at the highest level, was the leading theological facility at the Mosque of Uqba in Kairouan, founded circa 670. During the 9th-11th centuries, in addition to religious subjects, medicine, botany, astronomy, and math were taught. Above all the Uqba Mosque then {{was the center of the}} Maliki school of law. Muslim scholars, the ulama from throughout northern Africa, came here to study.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{problems}} that had hindered higher educational development in the past continued in 1987. Funding remained a major problem because science and technology study and research and study abroad were expensive. Because education was competing with other modernization programs, capital was critically short. Another concern was whether or not the Chinese economy was sufficiently advanced to make efficient use of the highly trained technical personnel it planned to educate. For example, some observers believed that it would be more realistic to train a literate work force of low-level technicians instead of research scientists. Moreover, it was feared that using an examination to recruit the most able <b>students</b> <b>might</b> advance people who were merely good at taking examinations. Educational reforms also made some people uncomfortable by criticizing the traditional practice of rote memorization and promoting innovative teaching and study methods.|$|E

25|$|As ultranationalist {{students}} {{demonstrated in}} the city and outside the venue, the police presence was especially heavy inside and around the stage. According to Tony Barrow, the police feared that these right-wing <b>students</b> <b>might</b> have placed snipers in the audience. The stage itself was set on an 8-foot-high podium; all ground-floor seating had been cleared, meaning the audience was restricted to the hall's first and second tiers. Concertgoers were warned that anyone standing up or cheering risked being arrested. The Beatles felt that the uniformed officers subdued the crowd, although the Japanese fans' more reserved nature, relative to the group's usual audiences, was also a factor. The band gave an especially poor performance on 30 June. According to Barrow and Aspinall, the group were humbled by this, having grown accustomed to not hearing themselves play, and resolved to perform well {{for the remainder of the}} Budokan dates.|$|E
25|$|Corporal {{punishment}} is prohibited in schools {{but it is}} still widely practiced. Both students (34%) and teachers (25%) reported corporal punishment by teachers and parents against girls in school. Apart from corporal punishment, mainly older boys beat up girls to harass and degrade them or in retaliation for a refusal to initiate a sexual relationship. Male <b>students</b> <b>might</b> snatch girls' school materials, intimidate them and threaten to harm them as a way of forcing them into sexual relationships. Parents could take girls' property as a disciplinary measure. School teachers were reported to humiliate and verbally abuse girls in class and this was worse if the girl was attractive. In the school community, girls most frequently suffered verbal abuse aimed at undermining their self-esteem. Other abuse involved touching private parts and punishment for refusing sexual requests. School girls might experience various forms of seduction before being subjected to sexually violent acts. This could be from school boys, teachers or rich sugar daddies who waited outside school gates.|$|E
500|$|Well {{into the}} 20th century, many {{physicians}} {{had looked at}} obstetrics as an unnecessary medical specialty. As a result, medical schools did not cover childbirth in much detail, and medical <b>students</b> <b>might</b> graduate without having even witnessed the delivery of a baby. Distressed by this lack of attention, DeLee made teaching and mentoring important parts of his career. With a maternal mortality rate about one-quarter of the national average, DeLee's Chicago Lying-In Hospital became well-respected and influential, and medical students would travel {{across the country to}} gain some experience there. A young woman named Beatrice Tucker came to Lying-In to complete her residency in 1929. Three years later, DeLee named Tucker director of the Chicago Maternity Center, where she worked for more than forty years and delivered an estimated 100,000 babies.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} level and style of the examination, a <b>student</b> <b>might</b> be asked to {{demonstrate}} anywhere from one to five different dances, all within one discipline, such as 'Standard', or 'Latin American'. That is because medals are awarded within disciplines. For example, at Bronze level, a Latin American dance <b>student</b> <b>might</b> be asked to dance Cha-cha-cha, Samba and Rumba, whilst the same student would definitely be asked to dance all five International Latin dances at Gold level. A single dance will take up around 60 to 90 seconds; the entire exam, allowing for short breaks between routines, will be between five and ten minutes, depending {{on the number of}} dances. Typically, a studio will have a large number of candidates, all examined on the same day.|$|R
50|$|Although ICFES {{provides}} several {{tests for}} different academic purposes, the ICFES test is nationally {{recognized as the}} most important test since it qualifies students according to their actual academic skills and therefore it can affect the possibilities that a <b>student</b> <b>might</b> have to be accepted in College.|$|R
40|$|Though college {{students}} spend four years learning, gaining information and forming their own ideas, {{they have little}} chance to express their own thoughts collectively.

500|$|In {{a part of}} {{the opinion}} concurred in by Chief Justice Burger and his allies, Powell found that the program, with its {{set-aside}} of a specific number of seats for minorities, did discriminate against Bakke, as less restrictive programs, such as making race one of several factors in admission, would serve the same purpose. Powell offered the example (set out in an appendix) of the admissions program at Harvard University as one he believed would pass constitutional muster‚Äîthat institution did not set rigid quotas for minorities, but actively recruited them and sought to include them as more than a token part of a racially and culturally diverse student body. Although a white student might still lose out to a minority with lesser academic qualifications, both white and minority <b>students</b> <b>might</b> gain from non-objective factors such as the ability to play sports or a musical instrument. [...] Accordingly, there was no constitutional violation in using race as one of several factors.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} post-War period {{once again}} reform {{on the agenda}} with, in particular, {{the passing of the}} Education Act 1944. The effect was dramatic: state support, through bursaries and central grants, was hugely increased; the proportion of state school entrants increased considerably; {{for the first time in}} over a hundred years, there was considerable competition over places. Stallybrass, made Vice-Chancellor of the University in 1947, was sceptical about state education. It was not the quality of the students, but rather the means of state control that worried him. Annual grants from government were made to the University, not colleges, and might yet replace endowments as Brasenose's primary source of income, making it dependent on University support and increasing [...] "federation" [...] of colleges in a University superstructure. Stallybrass worried over this loss of college autonomy, although it was matched with a doubled grant from the government and huge sums set aside for capital spending. The right of Brasenose to choose its own <b>students</b> <b>might</b> be under threat, he thought; as it happened, the Labour government decided against corporate admission and threats to Stallybrass' power mostly resided within Brasenose.|$|E
500|$|Duke athletics, {{particularly}} men's basketball, traditionally {{serves as}} a significant component of student life. Duke's students have been recognized {{as some of the}} most creative and original fans in all of collegiate athletics. Students, often referred to as Cameron Crazies, show their support of the men's basketball team by [...] "tenting" [...] for home games against key Atlantic Coast Conference rivals, especially University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). Because tickets to all varsity sports are free to students, they line up for hours before each game, often spending the night on the sidewalk. For a mid-February game against UNC, some of the most eager <b>students</b> <b>might</b> even begin tenting before spring classes begin. The total number of participating tents is capped at 100 (each tent can have up to 12 occupants), though interest is such that it could exceed that number if space permitted. Tenting involves setting up and inhabiting a tent on the grass near Cameron Indoor Stadium, an area known as Krzyzewskiville, or K-Ville for short. There are different categories of tenting based on the length of time and number of people who must be in the tent. At night, K-Ville often turns into the scene of a party or occasional concert. The men's basketball coach, Mike Krzyzewski, occasionally buys pizza for the inhabitants of the tent village.|$|E
50|$|Initially, a <b>student</b> <b>might</b> study three {{subjects}} at A-Level {{and one at}} AS-Level, or often even four subjects at A-Level.

5000|$|Algebra: The PSSM names four skills {{related to}} algebra {{that should be}} taught to all students: to [...] "understand patterns, relations, and functions; {{represent}} and analyze mathematical situations and structures using algebraic symbols; use mathematical models to represent and understand quantitative relationships; and analyze change in various contexts." [...] Very simple algebra skills are often taught to young children. For example, a <b>student</b> <b>might</b> convert an addition equation such as 19 + 15 = ? into a simpler equation, 20 + 14 = ? for easy calculation. Formally, this is described in algebraic notation like this: (19 + 1) + (15 ‚àí 1) = x, but even a young <b>student</b> <b>might</b> use this technique without calling it algebra. The PSSM recommends that all students complete pre-algebra coursework {{by the end of}} eighth grade and take an algebra class during high school.|$|R
