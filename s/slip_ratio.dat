40|$|In this study, a {{stochastic}} {{power management}} strategy for in-wheel motor electric vehicles (IWM-EV) is proposed {{to reduce the}} energy consumption and increase the driving range by considering the unpredictable nature of the driving power demand. A stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) approach, policy iteration algorithm, is used to create an infinite horizon problem formulation to calculate optimal power distribution policies for the vehicle. The developed SDP strategy distributes the demanded power, between {{the front and rear}} IWMs by considering states of the vehicle, including the vehicle speed and the front and the rear wheels' <b>slip</b> <b>ratios.</b> In addition, a skid avoidance rule is added to the power management strategy to maintain the wheels' <b>slip</b> <b>ratios</b> within the desired values. Undesirable <b>slip</b> <b>ratios</b> cause poor brake and traction control performances and therefore should be avoided. The resulting strategy consists of a time- invariant, rule-based controller which is fast enough for real-time implementations, and additionally, it is not expensive to be launched since the future power demand is approximated without a need to vehicle communication systems or telemetric capability. A high-fidelity model of an IWM-EV is developed in the Autonomie/Simulink environment for evaluating the proposed strategy. The simulation results show that the proposed SDP strategy is more efficient in comparison to some benchmark strategies, such as an equal power distribution (ED) and generalized rule- based dynamic programming (GRDP). The simulation results of different driving scenarios for the considered IWM-EV shows the proposed power management strategy leads to considerable energy consumption reduction in average, at no additional cost...|$|R

40|$|Elastohydrodynamic (EHD) {{lubrication}} {{is a form}} of fluid-film lubrication {{where the}} elastic deformation of the lubricated machine element in the contact region is significant. Under EHD lubrication, the pressure and temperature induced by the hydrodynamic motion within the fluid film cause a cyclic-stressed condition which results in severe fatigue and reliability problems. Therefore, {{a better understanding of the}} state of stress could greatly improve the design of machine elements operating under EHD lubrication. ^ The objective of this study was to develop numerical models to analyze elastohydrodynamic lubrication under rolling and sliding conditions. A satisfactory solution of the EHD problem requires the simultaneous solution of the hydrodynamic motion of the lubricant, the elastic deformation of the solids, and the energy transfer within the fluid film. ^ The nonlinear Newton-Raphson method was implemented to obtain the hydrodynamic pressure and the lubricant film thickness in the conjunction region. The control volume finite element method was used to provide the temperature rise within the lubricant film. The developed models were tested for various loads, speeds, <b>slip</b> <b>ratios,</b> and lubricant models. Some of the models developed in this study are:^ 1. Surface roughness effects on EHD lubrication. A numerical model was developed to incorporate the effect of surface roughness in EHD lubrication. The effects of various loads, surface pattern, and roughness parameter were investigated. ^ 2. Thermal effect on EHD lubrication. A complete solution of the thermal compressible elastohydrodynamic lubrication problem was obtained. The objective was to investigate the load, speed, and slip effect on lubricant temperature, film thickness, and surface traction. ^ 3. Non-Newtonian effect on EHD lubrication.

Two friction modifiers have particularly been used or tested on several railway networks as adhesion enhancers to facilitate the traction and braking operation under poor adhesion conditions. However, for assessment of the performance the railway operators and infrastructure managers mostly rely on practical observations that do not elucidate completely the effectiveness and side effects of these adhesion enhancers.
