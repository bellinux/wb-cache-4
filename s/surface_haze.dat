This route becomes very viable for coextruded multilayer films where the inner layers may be utilized to provide the desired mechanical properties, such as high modulus, controlled shrinkage, and good tear strength while the outer 'skin' layers are utilized to give low surface and total haze values. This study summarizes the effect on <b>surface</b> <b>haze</b> of various such 'skin' layer compositions with a broader goal to produce high clarity and high modulus multilayer blown films.

40|$|Accelerated {{weathering}} test {{was performed on}} blends of {{linear low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) and plastic film waste constituting the following percentages of polyolefin polymers (wt. %) : LLDPE (46 %), low density polyethylene (LDPE, 51 %), high density polyethylene (HDPE, 1 %), and polypropylene (PP, 2 %). Compounded blends were evaluated for their mechanical and physical (optical) properties. The impact of photodegradation on the formulated blends was studied, and loss of mechanical integrity was apparent with respect to both the exposure duration to weathering and waste content. The effect of processing conditions, namely, the die head temperature (DHT) of the blown-film assembly used, was investigated in this work. It was witnessed that surpassing the melting point of the blends constituting polymers did not always result in a synergistic behaviour between polymers. This was suspected to be due to the loss of amorphous region that polyolefin polymers get subjected to with UV exposure under weathering conditions and the effect of the plastic waste constituents. The total change in colour (ΔE) did not change with respect to DHT or waste content due to rapid change degradation on the material’s <b>surface.</b> <b>Haze</b> (%) and light transmission (%) decreased with the increase in waste content which was attributed to lack of miscibility between constituting polymers...|$|E
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of in vitro susceptibility tests of Haemophilus influenzae {{performed by the}} agar or broth dilution methods with Levinthal enrichment {{was found to be}} markedly influenced by the production of spheroplasts by this species. Using an inoculum of 107 organisms/ml, this phenomenon was frequently evident macroscopically as a haziness on agar substrates and in broths containing cell wall-acting agents, such as ampicillin, cephalothin, and penicillin, but was not noted with chloramphenicol. Phase-contrast microscopic examination of the haze from these sources revealed numerous spherical bodies in contrast to the typical cocco-bacillary forms observed in growth controls. With this inoculum size, minimal bactericidal concentrations could not be determined since subculture of 0. 1 ml of the hazy broths or the <b>surface</b> <b>haze</b> onto chocolate agar resulted in most instances {{in the development of a}} small number of colonies which, upon smear and gram stain, revealed typical Haemophilus morphology. An inoculum of 104 organisms/ml abolished the haziness on agar surfaces and in broths and resulted in clear-cut end points. Also, although spherical bodies were still present, they were distinctly less in number as contrasted to tests performed with an inoculum of 107 organisms/ml. It is recommended that minimal inhibitory concentration end points in antibiotic susceptibility tests be determined by microscopic, rather than macroscopic, observation of the growth milieu to determine the presence or absence of morphologically typical bacilli which, when observed, is indicative of true in vitro resistance...|$|E
40|$|As {{the capital}} of the most air-polluted Hebei {{province}} in China, Shijiazhuang has been suffering serious haze pollutions especially during wintertime. An integrated campaign for investigating aerosol optical properties under haze conditions over Shijiazhuang were carried out using a sunphotometer, an aethalometer and a lidar in the winter from late 2013 to early 2014. The results indicated that the haze episodes during the measurement period were severer and more frequent over Shijiazhuang than Beijing. Under heavy pollution conditions (PM 2. 5 > 150 μg/m 3) over Shijiazhuang, fine-mode fractions of AOD 500 nm were larger than 0. 80 with more dispersive angstrom exponent due to hygroscopic growth. The mean values of SSA over Shijiazhuang were smaller than those over Beijing both in this study and the severe haze episodes in January 2013, suggesting that there were more fine-mode absorbing particles over Shijiazhuang. More significant spectrally-dependence of imaginary part of refractive index over Shijiazhuang implies larger relative magnitude of brown carbon (BrC) as compared to Beijing. The black carbon (BC) measurement displayed extremely high records with a larger ratio of BC to PM 2. 5 (12. 11 % in average) comparing with other cities in China. The high carbonaceous aerosols (BC and BrC) should be attributed to large amounts of coal consumption. During the hazes with high BC concentrations, the daily maximal planetary boundary layer (PBL) heights were consistently lower than 500 m, implying the impacts of BC aerosols on the PBL development and hence enhance the <b>surface</b> <b>haze</b> pollution...|$|E

The potential for biofilm forma-tion by NSLAB during cheese manufacturing, the effect of cleaning and sanitizing on the biofilm, and bacterial growth and formation of defects during ripening of the contaminated cheese were studied. Stirred-curd Ched-dar cheese {{was made in the}} presence of stainless steel chips containing biofilms of either of two strains of erythromycin-resistant NSLAB (Lactobacillus curva-tus strain JBL 2126 or Lactobacillus fermentum strain AWL 4001). During ripening, the cheese was assayed for total lactic acid bacteria, numbers of NSLAB, and percentage of lactic acid isomers. Biofilms of L. curvatus formed during cheese making survived the cleaning process and persisted in a subsequent batch of cheese. The starter culture also survived the cleaning process. Additionally, L. curvatus biofilms present in the vat dislodged, grew to high numbers, and caused a calcium lactate white haze defect in cheese during ripening. On the other hand, biofilms of L. fermentum sloughed off during cheese making but could not compete with other NSLAB present in cheese during ripening. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis results verified the presence of the two biofilm strains during cheese mak-ing and in the ripening cheese.

40|$|The 380 nm {{radiance}} {{measurements of}} TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) have {{been converted into}} a global data set of daily (1979 to 1992) Lambert equivalent reflectivities R of the Earth's surface and boundary layer (clouds, aerosols, <b>surface</b> <b>haze,</b> and snow/ice). Since UV surface reflectivity is between 2 and 8 % for both land and water during all seasons of the year (except for ice and snow cover), reflectivities larger than the surface value indicates the presence of clouds, haze, or aerosols in the satellite field of view. Statistical analysis of 14 years of daily data show that most snow/ice-free regions of the Earth have their largest fraction of days each year when the reflectivity is low (R less than 10 %). The 380 nm reflectivity data shows that the true surface reflectivity is 2 to 3 % lower than the most frequently occurring reflectivity value for each TOMS scene. The most likely cause of this could be a combination of frequently occurring boundary-layer water or aerosol haze. For most regions, the observation of extremely clear conditions needed to estimate the surface reflectivity from space is a comparatively rare occurrence. Certain areas (e. g., Australia, southern Africa, portions of northern Africa) are cloud-free more than 80 % of the year, which exposes these regions to larger amounts of UV radiation than at comparable latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Regions over rain-forests, jungle areas, Europe and Russia, the bands surrounding the Arctic and Antarctic regions, and many ocean areas have significant cloud cover (R greater than 15 %) more than half of each year. In the low to middle latitudes, the areas with the heaviest cloud cover (highest reflectivity for most of the year) are the forest areas of northern South America, southern Central America, the jungle areas of equatorial Africa, and high mountain regions such as the Himalayas or the Andes.

Meanwhile, solar occultations provide constraints on the optical characteristics of the haze layer. This paper describes solar occultation observations obtained by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft. These observations strongly constrain the optical characteristics of the haze layer. We detail the different steps involved in the processing of these data and apply them to two occultations that were observed at the South Pole and at the equator in order to investigate the latitudinal dependence of optical properties. The light curves obtained in seven atmospheric windows between 0. 933 -microns to 5 -microns allow us to characterize atmospheric layers from 300 km to the surface. Very good fits of the light curves are obtained using a simple profile of number density of aerosols that is characterized by a scale height. The main difference between the South Pole and the equator is that the value of the scale height increases with altitude at the South Pole whereas it decreases at the equator. The vertically integrated amount of aerosols is similar at the two locations. The curve describing the cross-section versus wavelength is identical at the two locations suggesting that the aerosols have similar characteristics.

Haze aerosol analogs were generated from initial gas mixture concentrations of 10 % CH 4 in N 2, 2 % CH 4 in N 2, and 0. 4 % CH 4 in N 2 for studying the chemical properties, while haze aerosol analogs were generated from initial gas mixture concentrations of 10 % CH 4 in N 2 and 2 % CH 4 in N 2 for studying the optical properties. The infrared spectroscopy data showed that overall chemical mass, specifically aliphatic hydrocarbon mass, increased with increasing initial CH 4 gas concentrations, as did the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentration. These results directly support previous chemical composition data of aerosol analogs (Trainer et al., 2004). The UV-Vis data were used to calculate a relative imaginary refractive index k value, which revealed that haze aerosol analogs generated at lower initial CH 4 concentrations absorbed more in the shorter wavelengths of the visible range, while haze aerosol analogs generated at higher initial CH 4 concentrations absorbed more evenly over all visible wavelengths. This data did not closely support previous laboratory data regarding k values (Khare et al., 1984), which {{might be due to}} variations in pressure parameters of the experimental set-up.

This paper describes the characterization process that provides the best possible GaSb material for advanced IRFPA and SLS epi growth. The analysis of substrate by AFM <b>surface</b> roughness, particles, <b>haze,</b> GaSb oxide character and desorption using XPS, flatness measurements, and SLS based epitaxy quality are shown. By implementing subtle changes in our substrate processing, we show that a Sb-oxide rich surface is routinely provided for rapid desorption. Post-MBE CBIRD structures on the 100 mm ULD GaSb were examined and reveals a high intensity, 6. 6 nm periodicity, low (15. 48 arcsec) FWHM peak distribution that suggests low surface strain and excellent lattice matching. The Ra for GaSb is a consistent ~ 0. 2 - 4 nm, with average batch wafer warp of ~ 4 μm to provide a clean, flat GaSb template critical for next generation epi growth...|$|R
40|$|Human and {{wildlife}} conflicts {{have increased in}} importance in many suburban areas of the United States. Birds pose a serious hazard to air traffic, and 1, 200 - 1, 500 bird strikes are reported to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) annually. The location of a landfill near an airport may increase avian activity because landfills provide a food source for omnivorous birds. To reduce avian hazards at airports, FAA Order 5200. 5 A established a proximity criterion prohibiting the location of any runway used by turbojet aircraft within 3, 048 m of a landfill. However, existing landfills within this proximity may be kept open if an acceptable bird management strategy is developed and maintained. The objectives {{of this study were}} to: (1) document bird use at Nanticoke Sanitary Landfill; (2) evaluate 3 potential techniques for reducing bird numbers at the landfill; and (3) develop bird management guidelines for the landfill environment. Avian numbers, species, and behavior patterns were monitored at the landfill for 11 months (December 1991 through October 1992) before control activities were initiated. The repellent effects of methyl anthranilate (MA, ReJeXiT®), Posi-shellR (PS) cover material, and pyrotechnics (PT) were evaluated during late October to December 1992. A surface MA application did not reduce avian numbers at the landfill, as birds quicKly learned to tear open plastic refuse bags to obtain untreated food. PS treatment alone did not reduce numbers, as birds were able to forage through the thin <b>surface</b> covering. However, <b>hazing</b> birds with the spray equipment used to apply PS reduced the daily number of gulls (primarily herring gulls, (Larus argentatus) foraging at the landfill by about 50...|$|R
