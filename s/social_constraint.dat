The goals of this meta-analysis were: (1) to quantify the average strength of the relationships between <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> and general and cancer-specific distress in cancer patients; and (2) to examine potential moderators of these relationships. A literature search was conducted using electronic databases, and 30 studies met inclusion criteria. Moderate, significant relationships were found between <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> and both general distress (r = 0. 37, 95 % CI 0. 31 - 0. 43) and cancer-specific distress (r = 0. 37, 95 % CI 0. 31 - 0. 44).

40|$|A {{randomized}} controlled experiment {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of expressive writing and fact-control writing about experiences with ovarian cancer on emotional well-being {{and quality of life}} one month after writing in women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Moderation effects of emotional approach coping and <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> were predicted based on a matching hypothesis for the fit between the demands of writing and individual differences (Niles et al, 2014) and the role of <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> on disclosure (Lepore & Revenson, 2007). Cancer-related avoidance and cancer-related intrusive thoughts were examined as mediators on the relationships between <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> and emotional well-being at follow up and <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> and quality of life at follow up. Results showed that participants in the expressive writing condition reported increased emotional well-being at follow up, controlling for baseline levels of emotional well-being, but there were no differences in quality of life at follow up between the two writing conditions, controlling for baseline quality of life. There were no differences in reported average negative affect post writing sessions between the two writing conditions. In a model predicting emotional well-being at follow up, expressive writing had a positive effect, <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> had a negative effect, and emotional approach coping had no effect. The hypothesized moderation effects between emotional approach coping, <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> and writing condition in predicting emotional well-being at follow up were not detected and support for the matching hypothesis proposed by Niles et al (2014) was not found. In a marginally significant model, <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> had a significant effect and interacted with writing condition to predict quality of life at follow up, such that participants with high baseline levels of <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> benefitted more from the fact control condition, whereas participants with low baseline levels of <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> benefitted more from the expressive writing condition. Finally, cancer-related intrusive thoughts mediated the effect of <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> on emotional well-being at follow up but not on quality of life at follow up.

40|$|Objective Many {{breast cancer}} {{survivors}} feel constrained in discussing their cancer experience with others. Limited {{evidence suggests that}} <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> (e. g., avoidance and criticism) from loved ones may negatively impact breast cancer survivors' global health, but research has yet to examine relationships between <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> and common physical symptoms. Informed by social cognitive processing theory, this study examined whether perceived <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> from partners and healthcare providers (HCPs) were associated with fatigue, sleep disturbance, and attentional functioning among long-term breast cancer survivors (N[*]=[*] 1052). In addition, avoidant coping and self-efficacy for symptom management were examined as potential mediators of these relationships. Methods Long-term breast cancer survivors (mean years since diagnosis[*]=[*] 6) completed questionnaires assessing <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> from partners and HCPs, avoidant coping, self-efficacy for symptom management, and symptoms (i. e., fatigue, sleep disturbance, and attentional functioning). Structural equation modeling {{was used to evaluate}} the hypothesized relationships among variables in two models: one focused on <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> from partners and one focused on <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> from HCPs. Results Both models demonstrated good fit. Consistent with theory and prior research, greater <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> from both partners and HCPs were associated with greater symptom burden (i. e., greater fatigue and sleep disturbance, poorer attentional functioning). In addition, all relationships were mediated by avoidant coping and self-efficacy for symptom management.

Purpose: The present study examines the association between <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> and depressive symptoms among Chinese American breast cancer survivors, and the mechanism underling this association. A multi-processes model is tested to examine the mediating roles of ambivalence over emotional expression (AEE), avoidance, intrusive thoughts, and social support in the association between <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> and depressive symptoms among Chinese American breast cancer survivors. Methods: Ninety-six Chinese American breast cancer survivors were recruited from Chinese community organizations.

40|$|Purpose. This study {{applied the}} Social Cognitive Processing (SCP) model {{to examine whether}} {{positive}} (social support) and negative (<b>social</b> <b>constraints)</b> aspects of the social environment influenced emotional distress, quality of life (QoL), wellbeing and benefit finding after cancer. Methods. Participants were 439 adults at a median of 66 weeks post-diagnosis and 79 % of them had completed cancer treatments. Outcome measures and predictors were assessed twice, 6 months apart, and their relationships were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regressions. Results. Participants reported improved physical QoL at re-test. Correlations showed that better outcomes for depression, anxiety, QoL, and wellbeing were associated with higher social support and lower <b>social</b> <b>constraints.</b> In addition, benefit finding correlated with social support but not <b>social</b> <b>constraints.</b> After other predictors were taken into account, lower initial <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> were modestly associated with improved mental QoL at re-test. Higher <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> scores also predicted development of clinically significant depression and anxiety. Conclusions. Results provided some support for the SCP model's prediction that {{both positive and negative}} aspects of social environment can contribute to adjustment in people with cancer. Although several findings supported the model, a heterogeneous sample and small effect sizes indicate that replication and further study is needed.

40|$|Purpose Long-term {{breast cancer}} {{survivors}} frequently report distress (i. e., depressive symptoms) that impacts {{their quality of}} life. Previous {{studies have found that}} negative social interactions (“social constraints”) from partners contribute to long-term, unresolved cycling of intrusive thoughts and cognitive avoidance, resulting in psychological distress. However, these relationships have not been tested in long-term breast cancer survivors. Furthermore, the effect of partners’ depressive symptoms on the survivors’ depressive symptoms has not been tested within the context of these relationships. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to test relationships between breast cancer survivors’ depressive symptoms and (1) <b>social</b> <b>constraints,</b> cognitive avoidance, and intrusive thoughts, and (2) partners’ depressive symptoms. Methods Data were from a cross-sectional descriptive study of breast cancer survivors (N = 222) 3 – 8 years post-diagnosis and their partners, who completed surveys assessing demographic characteristics, <b>social</b> <b>constraints,</b> intrusive thoughts, cognitive avoidance, and depressive symptoms. Structural equation modeling confirmatory path analyses were conducted to determine significant relationships between survivors’ depressive symptoms and all other variables. Results Our model fits the data well. Breast cancer survivors’ depressive symptoms were predicted by <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> and intrusive thoughts. The relationship between survivors’ depressive symptoms and partners’ depressive symptoms was close but not significant. Conclusions As hypothesized, depressive symptoms were predicted by <b>social</b> <b>constraints</b> and intrusive thoughts. Further research is needed to understand the possible relationship between survivors’ long-term depressive symptoms and cognitive avoidance and partners’ depressive symptoms.

5000|$|The {{notion of}} {{successful}} ageing, a term used in global {{health and the}} knowledge-making areas related to ageing (mainly gerontology, the caring professions, and organizations such as WHO), is based on liberal ideas favoring individualistic principles of choice over processes of <b>social</b> <b>constraint.</b> A neo-liberal and entrepreneurial vision of aging, inspired by gerontological ideals about active and successful lifestyles, has entered the health and retirement fields, with practical and policy consequences. This governmental rationality maximizes individual responsibility {{in order to minimize}} dependency in Western countries. In this context, successful ageing depends on an individualistic set of practices determined by predictors around smoking, diet, and exercise. While claims of choice and experimentation have opened new avenues of self-definition, such ideals can diminish the more genuine struggles to live successfully and obscure social inequalities. Stephen Katz reminds us that [...] "lifestyle" [...] (a concept informing the notion of successful ageing) was first positioned by social theorists in a myriad of life chances, status hierarchies and social contexts. For example, falls are assumed to happen to people who lack some physical control. Prevention programs therefore advocate [...] "active ageing", individual behavioral changes such as exercise regimes (and residential modifications like better lighting). These strategies do not take into account social differences like class and gender, and also require adequate resources. For example, it seems that women fall more often and suffer more fracture-related falls than do men. These falls take place in a context where femininity is culturally coded as more frail and vulnerable than masculinity and where physical strength in women is not encouraged. Other gendered factors may be causing their falls, such as their greater use of psychotropic drugs, and not their lack of physical strength. Policies often sustain and reinforce cultural constructs, such as [...] "frailty", and therefore shape experiences. Such cultural constructions of gender and age, the global economic rationale of cost restriction and the biomedical focus on ageing collide as inscriptions on the bodies of older women.|$|E

Then a sage appeared who created the boring of wood to produce fire so as to transform the rank and putrid foods.

Campany (2005:16) calls this [...] "the decline of Power and the ever-farther departure from the natural Dao into systems of <b>social</b> <b>constraint</b> and what passes for culture." [...] The ancients, in the midst of chaos, were tranquil together with the whole world. At that time, yin and yang were harmoniously still, ghosts and spirits caused no disturbances; the four seasons came in good time; the myriad things went unharmed; the host of living creatures escaped premature death. … This condition persisted until integrity deteriorated to the point that Torchman Suiren and Fuhsi arose to manage all under heaven, whereupon there was accord, but no longer unity. Integrity further declined until the Divine Farmer and the Yellow Emperor arose to manage all under heaven, whereupon there was repose, but no longer accord.

Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis in which disease activity was measured with either the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index. HRQOL was measured with the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire. Coping was measured with a modified COPE questionnaire. Anxiety and depression symptoms were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. <b>Social</b> <b>constraint</b> was measured with the <b>Social</b> <b>Constraint</b> Questionnaire. Correlational and regression analyses were performed to assess the relationships between <b>social</b> <b>constraint,</b> coping, anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and HRQOL and disease activity. Results: Data from 80 adults with IBD were reviewed. <b>Social</b> <b>constraint,</b> disengagement coping, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms were inversely correlated with HRQOL. Disengagement coping {{was positively correlated with}} disease activity. Regression analyses showed that smokers had significantly worse HRQOL than nonsmokers and that greater use of engagement coping was associated with significantly diminished HRQOL. Regression analyses also showed that patients diagnosed between 17 and 40 years of age were significantly less likely to have active disease than patients diagnosed before 16 years of age and that greater use of disengagement coping was associated with increased odds of having active disease. Conclusions: Medical providers should be aware that coexisting <b>social</b> <b>constraint</b> and symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in patients with IBD.
