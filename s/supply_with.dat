5|$|Efforts {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India. When {{a clear idea of}} the {{conspiracy}} emerged, more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support. Herambalal Gupta, who had arrived in the United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved to be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Like many burgeoning {{cities of}} its day, Pittsburgh's growth outstripped {{some of its}} {{necessary}} infrastructure, such as a water <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> dependable pressure. Because of this, on April 10, 1845, a great fire burned out of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $9M in damages. As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived. In 1851, the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City (present-day North Side). In 1854, the Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} fish are {{viviparous}}. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother's blood <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> that of the embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches, splitfins, and lemon shark. Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. Intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the grey nurse shark, but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of wetland {{complexes}} in the watershed of Stafford Meadow Brook. These include Bear Swamp (which is at the stream's headwaters), Simerson Marsh, and Little Virginia. The first of these is a Pocono wetland bog. Lakes in the watershed include Lake Scranton, the District Number Fifty-Nine Reservoir, the Williams Bridge Reservoir, and Hazard Pond. Lake Scranton and the Williams Bridge Reservoir are used as a water <b>supply,</b> <b>with</b> the former providing 22 million gallons of water per day. Together with Roaring Brook and Spring Brook, it provides {{a substantial portion of the}} water supply of the Lackawanna Valley. Downstream of Lake Scranton, the watershed contains a lake used by the Montage Mountain Ski Resort for snowmaking.|$|E

25|$|Saudi Arabia {{also depends}} on the {{international}} nurse <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> 40 nations represented in its nurse workforce.

50|$|About 90% {{of public}} water {{systems in the}} U.S. obtain their water from {{groundwater}}. However, since systems served by groundwater tend to be much smaller than systems served by surface water, only 34% of Americans (101 million) are <b>supplied</b> <b>with</b> treated groundwater, while 66% (195 million) are <b>supplied</b> <b>with</b> surface water.|$|R

25|$|In the Australian State of Queensland, from 1 January 2017 all smoke alarms in new {{dwellings}} (or where {{a dwelling}} is substantially renovated) must be photoelectric, not also contain an ionisation sensor, be hardwired to the mains power <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> a secondary power source (i.e. battery) and be interconnected {{with every other}} smoke alarm in the dwelling so all activate together.|$|E
25|$|Hydrological {{resources}} (see Geography above) {{are also}} lacking: {{the demand for}} water exceeds the <b>supply,</b> <b>with</b> this imbalance especially serious in Alicante province. In particularly severe drought years, the problem is managed through occasional nocturnal restrictions during summer and exploitation of aquifers. Valencia's water needs result in harsh contention with neighbouring regions such as Castilla–La Mancha and Catalonia.|$|E

An estimated 2W of power are used while the older versions of console are {{in standby mode}} giving a yearly usage of approximately 17.5kWh. The new version uses around 0.5W while in standby. Saving the console size and weight, the power supply displaces 1300cm³.|$|E
25|$|Several {{different}} companies and municipalities operated London's electric tramways. The largest was the LCC, with lines {{equipped with an}} unusual form of electricity supply via an underground conduit located between the running rails. Other operators mainly used the more conventional overhead electric wires. Many of London's trams had to be equipped with both systems of electricity <b>supply,</b> <b>with</b> routes being equipped with change points.|$|E
25|$|Balancing costs: to {{maintain}} grid stability, some additional costs may be incurred for balancing of load with demand. The {{ability of the}} grid to balance <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> demand {{will depend on the}} rate of change of the amount of energy produced (by wind, for example) and the ability of other sources to ramp production up or scale production down. Balancing costs have generally been found to be low.|$|E
