5000|$|Invented and {{patented}} by an American engineer of Ukrainian descent William Dzus (Volodymyr Dzhus) {{in the early}} 1930s, Dzus fasteners are also used to <b>secure</b> <b>plates,</b> doors, and panels that require frequent removal for inspection and servicing. These fasteners are notable {{in that they are}} of an [...] "over-centre" [...] design, requiring positive sustained torque to unfasten. Thus, any minor disturbance to the fastener (e.g. vibration) will tend to correct itself rather than proceed to further loosening as it would in threaded fasteners. Turnlock fasteners are available in several different styles and are usually referred to by the manufacturer's trade name. Some of the most common are DZUS, Camloc, and Airloc.|$|R

30|$|The {{primary goal}} in {{treatment}} of post-traumatic deformity of the distal radius is to restore anatomical alignment and prevent secondary displacement. Traditionally, extra-articular osteotomy is performed to re-establish volar tilt in the saggital plane and radial inclination in the coronal plane, correct any rotational malalignment in the horizontal plane, and restore radial length [14, 15]. Several fixation modalities {{are available for}} distal radius osteotomy. Osteosynthesis with dorsal and/or volar plates needs sufficient exposure to facilitate direct visualization, accurate reduction, and <b>secure</b> <b>plating</b> fixation. Common criticisms exist regarding wide soft-tissue dissection, tendon complication including tenosynovitis or tendon rupture, and prominence of hardware with internal fixation plate. Many patients need subsequent removal of the implant [16 – 18]. Intramedullary nails for fixation of the distal radius are intended to minimize those complications in treatment of post-traumatic deformity of distal radius [19]. With the benefits of limited soft-tissue dissection, a low-profile implant with less risk of tendon attrition, divergent subchondral screw placement, and locked fixed-angle fixation, the intramedullary nail serves as an internal splint to provide sufficient stability, allow immediate active motion at the fracture site and acquire healing through peripheral callus remodeling [11, 20, 21].|$|R

40|$|The Gamma nail was {{designed}} to treat unstable interfrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. The device was developed after cadaver studies and has been used clinically since February 1985 {{in a total of}} 421 patients. The results in 123 patients freated by the third version of this design are reported. The Gamma nail transmits weight closer to the calcar than does the dynamic hip screw and it has greater mechanical sfrength. A semi-closed operative technique is used, with an average duration of operation of 35 minutes and liftie blood loss. Distal locking screws can be used to maintain rotational stabifity, and can be inserted without the use of an image intensifier. Results showed satisfactory fracture union with little loss of position, even in comminuted fractures. Operative complications were few, but included fractures of the base of the greater trochanter. The most important postoperative complication, seen in one case, was fracture of the shaft of the femur at the distal end of the nail, but this healed well after re-nailing. Unstable intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures are difficult to fix and can present problems in manage-ment (Esser, Kassab and Jones 1986; Bergman et al 1987; Chang et al 1987). The most common current method of fixation uses a large screw in the femoral head <b>secured</b> to a <b>plate</b> on the lateral aspect ofthe upper femur. This has the disadvantage that the plate is lateral to the line of load-bearing. Any defect in the medial cortex of the femur, due to imperfect reduction, comminution or a metastasis, means that a varus stress will be applied to the fixation with every weight-bearing step. This may cause cutting-out of the screw from the head of the femur (Davis et al 1990) or failure at the nail-plate junction or of the screws <b>securing</b> the <b>plate</b> to the bone (Waddell 1979; Amis, Bromage and Larvin 1987). The use of the Zickel nail meets some of these objections, {{but it is difficult to}} insert and has its own complications, such as fracture of the base of the greater trochanter. The Gamma nail was accordingly developed in an attempt to overcome some of these problems...|$|R

40|$|Background. Postresective mandibular {{reconstruction}} {{is common}} in cases of oral and mandibular tumors. However, complications such as infection, plate exposure, or plate fracture can occur. We identified several significant risk factors of complications after reconstructive surgery and compared the effectiveness of different surgical techniques for reducing the incidence of complications. Methods. This study is a retrospective analysis of 28 oromandibular cancer cases that required reconstructive surgery between January 1999 and December 2011 at Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan. All cases were classified using Hashikawa’s CAT and Eichner’s classification methods. Then, we determined whether these classifications and different treatment or surgical methods {{were significantly related to}} complications. Results. Complications after mandibular reconstruction occurred in 10 / 28 patients (36 %). Specifically, five patients had plate fractures, four had plate exposures, and one had an infection. Radiation therapy and closure without any flaps were significantly related to infection or plate exposure. The wrap-around technique of <b>securing</b> reconstruction <b>plates</b> was used in 14 cases, whereas the run-through technique was used in two cases. Conclusions. The success of mandibular reconstruction depends on both mechanical and biological factors, such as the location of defects, presence of occlusions, and the amount of vascularization of the flap...|$|R
40|$|There exists several {{applications}} {{where it}} is desirable to produce random numbers such that adding these random numbers yields a publicly known sum. Efficient algorithms are necessary for generating such joint random numbers in an untrusted environment in settings such as, but not restricted to, multi-party computation (MPC).

Then, we focus on a core component in MPC protocols, namely on how to generate these joint random numbers. We first analyze the existing work. Then, we propose two new protocols to efficiently achieve joint random number generation, both in terms of computational demand and communication. We show that our second protocol can also omit the need for secure networks, meaning all the messages can be public. In addition to these protocols we also introduce an extension for general joint random number generation protocols in large networks based on a star topology, with explicit protocols for parties that are joining or leaving.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a process planning methodology for a rapid injection mold tool manufacturing system that involves additive and subtractive techniques, whereby slabs are sequentially bonded and milled using layered tool paths. Mold tools are grown in a bottom up fashion, {{eliminating the need}} for multi-axis machining operations (beyond three axes) and allowing small features in deep cavities. In this research, a new layer bonding method using friction stir welding of aluminum plates is presented. In this manner, one can create seam-free laminated aluminum injection mold tooling using a unique combination of industrial adhesives and friction stir spot welding to initially secure the slab, then continuous friction stir welding of layer perimeters that are sequentially machined in a layer wise process. The original research is presented as a journal article. This research includes three areas of interest that will enable highly automated process planning. The first research area focuses on determining the process plan for applying adhesives on the laminated plates that will be sufficient to resist the forces acting on the plate due to subsequent friction stir spot welding. The use of fixtures and clamps for machining in rapid manufacturing create a potential problem for collision of the tool/spindle and the workpiece setup. Therefore, the process proposed in this thesis uses a combination of industrial adhesives and friction stir spot welding to <b>secure</b> the aluminum <b>plates</b> for machining. The second area focuses on determining the number, location and sequence of friction stir spot welds sufficient to <b>secure</b> the <b>plate</b> prior to continuous friction stir welding. The use of adhesive alone is assumed to be not sufficient to withstand the high forces involved in the friction stir welding process. Therefore, there is need to friction stir spot weld the plates to hold them against the previously formed stack. The location and the number depend on the geometry of that particular layer. The final research area focuses on creating a toolpath planning method for the friction stir welding and CNC machining of each laminated plate. The FSW toolpath is generated based on a predetermined offset distance from the boundary of the polygon representing each cross sectional slice of the mold, while the CNC machining uses a basic waterline toolpath strategy. The impact of this research is that it will provide a completely automated process planning approach for rapid tool manufacturing that is currently not possible using existing additive- or subtractive- only approaches...|$|R
