40|$|Steam {{generators}} {{in nuclear}} power plants experienced varying degrees of under-deposit pitting corrosion. A probabilistic model to accurately predict pitting corrosion is necessary for effective life-cycle management of steam generators. This thesis presents an advanced probabilistic model of pitting corrosion characterizing the inherent randomness of the pitting process and measurement uncertainties of the in-service inspection (ISI) data obtained from eddy current (EC) inspections. A Bayesian method is developed for estimating the model parameters. The proposed model is able to estimate the number of actual pits, the actual pit depth {{as well as the}} maximum pit depth, which is the main interest of the pitting corrosion model. A MATLAB program of the Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is developed to perform the Bayesian estimations. Simulation experiments are performed to check the behavior of the Bayesian method. Results show that the MCMC algorithm is an effective way to estimate the model parameters. Also, the effectiveness and efficiency of Bayesian modeling are validated. A comprehensive case study is also presented on the in-service inspection data of pitting corrosion in a <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> <b>unit.</b> The Weibull distribution is found to be an appropriate probability distribution for modeling the actual pit depth in steam generators...|$|E

Using the control volume method, the heat balance equations can be written {{for each of the}} nodes for each of the control volumes. Thus, for a known temperature {{in the middle of the}} cylindrical element, the distribution of temperature in three nodes and heat flux at the outer surface were obtained.

40|$|Purpose - This {{paper is}} to apply lean {{principles}} to eliminate excess <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> in the company. A multifunctional team which has a strong knowledge on process, simulation tools, and broad projects knowledge were involved. Methodology/Approach – PT. YKL has five steam stations for running its business, extracting oil from its reservoir. The steam stations are home for 218 <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> <b>units.</b> As its oil reservoirs mature, naturally the reservoirs require less steam. As the demand drops, PT. YKL needs to balance the supply. As a result, they have excess number of <b>steam</b> <b>generators.</b> They are initially identified it by collecting the unit’s allocation for maintenance and other shutdown issue per steam stations. This available-unit less maintenance-allocation shows the true <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> supply capability. On the demand side, PT. YKL also looked at its demand forecast profile {{in the years to}} come. Defining the excess unit per steam station limits the number of excess unit they can eliminate. To maximize it, PT. YKL totally changed the way they defined the excess. By collecting all the excess in once steam station, they can maximize the number of excess. However, they need to ensure that the remaining <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> can satisfy the customer’s requirements (in term of flow and pressure). Here simulation tools played its key role. Findings - It was found the implementation of this lean initiative was successfully decommissioned 46 excess <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> from 218 <b>steam</b> <b>generators.</b> Research limitations / implications: The simulation tool could not exactly represent the actual key process parameters.

40|$|The {{deregulated}} {{energy market}} and the increasing quota of electrical capacity covered by non-predictable renewable sources require strongly irregular and discontinuous operation of thermoelectric plants to satisfy users demand and compensate the variability of renewable sources. As a consequence, due to thermo-mechanical fatigue, creep and corrosion, a lifetime reduction {{of the most critical}} components occurs. The availability of a procedure able to predict the residual life of plant devices is necessary to assist the management decisions about power plants’ operation and maintenance scheduling. The first step of this procedure is the capability of simulating the plant behaviour versus time by evaluating the trends of the main thermodynamic parameters that describe the plant operation during different transient periods. In this context, the main contribution of the present paper is to propose a complete procedure able to simulate the plant dynamic behaviour and estimate the residual life reduction of some components. Indeed, two different models, developed by two different research groups, of the same single pressure heat recovery <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> <b>unit</b> are presented and utilized to characterize the dynamic behaviour of the above mentioned power plant. The main thermodynamic variables during different transient operation conditions are predicted and good correspondence between the two methods is obtained. It can be also noted that, when the geometry and size of the devices are considered, the thermal inertia related to heat exchangers tubes, pipes and other physical masses causes a delay in the system response. Moreover, a residual life estimation of the most stressed component is presented...|$|E

To simulate such event, an experimental test has been carried out on the LIFUS 5 facility at the ENEA Brasimone Research Centre, in order to assess the physical effects and the possible consequences connected to this kind of interaction. The experiment has been conducted by injecting water at the pressure of 185 bar and with a temperature of 300 °C into a volume of 80 l of Lead Bismuth Eutectic (LBE) kept at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of 400 °C.

The experimental test has been supported through a numerical modelling campaign performed at the University of Pisa by means of the SIMMER code within both 2 -D (SIMMER III) and 3 -D (SIMMER IV) models. Pre-test simulations have been carried out to aid the design of the new facility configuration and to select the test conditions which could better reproduce the behaviour expected for ELSY.

40|$|Weed {{competition}} {{is a major}} problem in organic agriculture, because the use of herbicides is prohibited. Vegetable crops are generally the most sensitive from this point of view, especially the sown ones, because they often need plenty of time for emergence. This often implies a large effort for hand weeding in the rows, which are very difficult to be treated physically in a selective way. Soil steaming could be a possible solution for preventive weed control/weed seedbank depletion in organic/integrated low-competitive vegetable crops, in order to reduce labor time for in-row hand-weeding. The effect of bioflash system (consisting in the distribution of steam and CaO) on weed seedbank was “exploited” to develop a new machine for “band-steaming”. In this case, steaming is performed just in strips, where the crop will be successively sown. Each strip corresponds to one crop row. The machine is drawn and is equipped with a water tank, a hopper containing the exothermic compound (CaO) and an industrial steam generator providing an outflow of about 1300 kg h- 1. The <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> <b>unit</b> is connected to a 5. 10 m wide, PTO-driven rotary cultivator with 12 units. Each unit is connected to a steam pipe and is characterized by the rotating tool and a carter which bears the steaming bar. The tested working speed ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 5 km h- 1. The steam injection is superficial in order to kill the weed seeds till a depth of about 5 cm. The prototype has been tested on carrot in four organic farms spread throughout Italy. The results are encouraging as the soil temperature peak was about 80 °C and the weed emergence reduction, 10 days after planting, ranged on average from 70 % up to over 90 %. On average the 50 % of labour demand for hand weeding was saved (about 200 h ha- 1).

Formation and transport of corrosion products formed due to the {{presence of}} impurities, metals and metallic oxides in the secondary side of the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> <b>units</b> result in formation of deposits. This research deals with understanding the deposit formation and characterization of deposits by studying the samples collected from different units in secondary side system at Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES). Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) have been used for studying the phases, morphologies and compositions of the iron oxides formed at Unit 1 and Unit 2 of secondary side of steamgenerator systems. Hematite and magnetite were found to be the dominant phases of iron oxides present in the units. Fe, Cr, O, Ni, Si, Cl and Cu were found in samples collected from both the units. A qualitative method was developed to differentiate iron oxides using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) based on temporal response of iron oxides to a high power laser beam. A quantitative FTIR technique was developed to identify and quantify iron oxides present in the different components of the secondary side of the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> of CPSES.

40|$|International audience# N° 1121 Experimental {{results of}} passive vibro-acoustic leak {{detection}} in SFR <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> mock-up 1 Abstract— Regarding to GEN 4 context, {{it is necessary}} to fulfil the high safety standards for sodium fast reactors (SFR), particularly against water-sodium reaction which may occur in the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> <b>units</b> (SGU) in case of leak. This reaction can cause severe damages in the component in a short time. Detecting such a leak by visual in-sodium inspection is impossible because of sodium opacity. Hydrogen detection is then used but the time response of this method can be high in certain operating conditions. Active and passive acoustic leak detection methods were studied before SUPERPHENIX plant shutdown in 1997 to detect a water-into-sodium leak with a short time response. In the context of the new R&D studies for SFR, an innovative passive vibro-acoustic method is developed in the framework of a Ph. D. thesis to match with GEN 4 safety requirements. The method consists in assuming that a small leak emits spherical acoustic waves in a broadband frequency domain, which propagate in the liquid sodium and excite the SGU cylindrical shell. These spatially coherent waves are supposed to be buried by a spatially incoherent background noise. The radial velocities of the shell is measured by an array of accelerometers positioned on the external envelop of the SGU and a beamforming treatment is applied to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and to detect and localize the acoustic source. Previous numerical experiments were achieved and promising results were obtained. In this paper, experimental results of the proposed passive vibro-acoustic leak detection are presented. The experiment consists in a cylindrical water-filled steel pipe representing a model of SGU shell without tube bundle. A hydrophone emitting an acoustic signal is used to simulate an acoustic monopole. Spatially uncorrelated noise or water-flow induced shell vibrations are considered as the background noise. The beamforming method is applied to vibration signals measured by a linear array of accelerometers on the shell. Satisfying results are obtained regarding to detection and localization of the source smothered by the background noise.

In the present work, one such analysis is carried out to evaluate the contact pressure in a high pressure steam turbine casing. The shape and design of a steam turbine casing depends on key sensitivity parameters like bolt pre-tensions, contact pressure and thickness of casing which determine the structural integrity of the casing.

25|$|In February 2000, Unit 2 {{experienced}} a <b>Steam</b> <b>Generator</b> Tube Rupture (SGTR), which allowed primary water to leak into the secondary system {{through one of}} the <b>steam</b> <b>generators.</b> All four <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> were subsequently replaced.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to (1) ensure that {{the design of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> is {{adequate}} for implementing a <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> program and (2) verify that the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> program will result in maintaining tube integrity during operation and postulated accident conditions. The <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> program is intended to ensure that the structural and leakage integrity of the tubes is maintained at a level comparable to that of the original design requirements. The specific areas of review are as follows: 1. The design of the primary and secondary side of the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> is reviewed to ensure that it permits implementation of a <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> program...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> irons, {{pressurised}} and non-pressurised. A non-pressurised <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> iron will produce a lot of steam but the steam is released at a lower speed, typically around 80-100 grams per minute. A pressurised <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> iron, on the other hand, creates a highly pressurised environment that helps the steam penetrate fabric more efficiently. A pressurised <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> iron will typically have a steam output of 100-120 grams per minute. The amount of pressure a <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> iron has is measured in bars, with a higher bar number meaning the steam has more pressure. <b>Steam</b> <b>generator</b> irons typically have 3-6 bars of pressure.|$|R
40|$|Subject of {{this thesis}} is {{design of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> for modular reactor. The {{dissertation}} consist of the theoretical part, where are described heat-exchangers and <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> used in nuclear power plants. Second part contains theoretical calculations in the first approach (thermal, hydraulic and strenght calculation). In the next part are particular variants of <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> selected. For the final variant are necessary calculations (introduced above) and drawings of selected parts are done. In the final statement is technical solution evaluated, and {{the parameters of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> are compared with actually used <b>steam</b> <b>generators...</b>|$|R
40|$|A high {{temperature}} gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) is under development by the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) Project at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Its design emphasizes electrical power production which may potentially be coupled with process heat for hydrogen production and other industrial applications. NGNP {{is considering a}} helical-coil <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> for the primary heat transport loop heat exchanger based on its increased heat transfer and compactness {{when compared to other}} <b>steam</b> <b>generators.</b> The safety and reliability of the helical-coil <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> is currently under evaluation as part of the development of NGNP. Transients, such as loss of coolant accidents (LOCA), are of interest in evaluating the safety of <b>steam</b> <b>generators.</b> In this study, a complete <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> inlet pipe break (double ended pipe break) LOCA was simulated by an exponential loss of primary side pressure. For this analysis, a model of the helical-coil <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> was developed using RELAP 5 - 3 D, an INL in-house systems analysis code. The <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> model behaved normally during the transient simulating the complete <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> inlet pipe break LOCA. Further analysis is required to comprehensively evaluate the safety and reliability of the helical-coil <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> design in the NGNP setting...|$|R
