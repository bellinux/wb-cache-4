5|$|The {{association}} {{found itself}} competing for young people's time against many other extracurricular activities and schools themselves which were increasingly venturing into the <b>same</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> activities.

5|$|Advancements {{in weapons}} {{technology}} enhanced by gunpowder, including {{the evolution of}} the early flamethrower, explosive grenade, firearm, cannon, and land mine, enabled the Song Chinese to ward off their militant enemies until the Song's ultimate collapse in the late 13th century. The Wujing Zongyao manuscript of 1044 was the first book in history to provide formulas for gunpowder and their specified use in different types of bombs. While engaged in a war with the Mongols, in 1259 the official Li Zengbo wrote in his Kezhai Zagao, Xugaohou that the city of Qingzhou was manufacturing one to two thousand strong iron-cased bomb shells a month, dispatching to Xiangyang and Yingzhou about ten to twenty thousand such bombs at a time. In turn, the invading Mongols employed northern Chinese soldiers and used these <b>same</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder weapons against the Song. By the 14th century the firearm and cannon could also be found in Europe, India, and the Islamic Middle East, during the early age of gunpowder warfare.|$|E

5|$|While various {{religions}} and denominations have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through {{concepts such as}} theistic evolution, there are creationists who believe that evolution is contradicted by the creation myths found in their {{religions and}} who raise various objections to evolution. As had been demonstrated by responses to the publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation in 1844, the most controversial aspect of evolutionary biology is the implication of human evolution that humans share common ancestry with apes and that the mental and moral faculties of humanity have the <b>same</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> natural causes as other inherited traits in animals. In some countries, notably the United States, these tensions between science and religion have fuelled the current creationâ€“evolution controversy, a religious conflict focusing on politics and public education. While other scientific fields such as cosmology and Earth science also conflict with literal interpretations of many religious texts, evolutionary biology experiences significantly more opposition from religious literalists.|$|E

POTS telephone signals have a frequency of about 3 kHz, close to the baseband audio frequency.

These frequencies are similar to the electromagnetic wave frequencies often used to transmit the <b>same</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> information over the air.|$|E

While this discovery did {{not rule out the}} possibility that Oviraptor included eggs in its diet, its exact feeding strategies remain unknown. The only Oviraptor philoceratops skeleton preserved the remains of a lizard in the region of its stomach cavity, implying that the species was at least partially carnivorous.|$|E

25|$|Writing {{systems were}} preceded by proto-writing, which used pictograms, ideograms and other {{mnemonic}} symbols. Proto-writing lacked {{the ability to}} capture and express {{a full range of}} thoughts and ideas.

Soon after, writing provided a reliable form of long distance communication. With the advent of publishing, it provided the medium for an early form of mass communication.|$|E

In the past such shows as Rookie Blue, Rescue Me, Big Love, United States of Tara, Tangle and The Secret Life of Us have been purchased by RTÃ‰ and aired between 00:00 and 06:00 on RTÃ‰ Two. RTÃ‰ has argued that TV3 has rarely gone after the <b>same</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> imported programming and that such shows perform better than when broadcast in prime time on TV3.|$|E
