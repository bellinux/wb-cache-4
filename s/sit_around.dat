25|$|Once they dry out, {{the pots}} are then painted with nature and {{religious}} art. They would then <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> {{for about a}} week after which they would be taken to the kiln. This is a special place for baking the pottery where it is fired in the open air, usually using cow dung for fuel. After baking, most pots are used to store food and collect water.|$|E
25|$|Supra-aural {{headphones}} or on-ear headphones have pads {{that press}} against the ears, rather than around them. They were commonly bundled with personal stereos during the 1980s. This type of headphone generally {{tends to be}} smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise. Supra-aural headphones {{can also lead to}} discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> the ear. Comfort may vary due to the earcup material.|$|E

25|$|The {{circular}} or polygonal form lent {{itself to}} those buildings within church complexes that perform a function {{in which it}} is desirable for people to stand, or <b>sit</b> <b>around,</b> with a centralised focus, rather than an axial one. In Italy the circular or polygonal form was used throughout the medieval period for baptisteries, while in England it was adapted for chapter houses. In France the aisled polygonal plan was adapted as the eastern terminal and in Spain the same form is often used as a chapel.|$|E
25|$|The F121 engine had a rare set {{of design}} {{parameters}} {{as it is}} designed to be used only once. As a cruise missile engine, it was designed to have a long shelf life (be able to <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> unused for long periods of time) and then operate when needed for several hours. It was designed to power the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, which was to be a stand-off anti radiation missile. Its first flight was on July 30, 1984. The AGM-136 program was canceled several years later.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} infrequency of SWAT call-outs means these expensively {{trained and}} equipped officers cannot {{be left to}} <b>sit</b> <b>around,</b> waiting for an emergency. In many departments the officers are normally deployed to regular duties, but are available for SWAT calls via pagers, mobile phones, or radio transceivers. Even in the larger police agencies, such as the LAPD or the NYPD, SWAT personnel will normally be seen in crime suppression roles—specialized and more dangerous than regular patrol, perhaps, but the officers would not be carrying their distinctive armor and weapons.|$|E
50|$|Hendrickson throws four pitches: a four-seam fastball, a curveball, a changeup, {{as well as}} a cutter. His fastball {{varies from}} 87-91 MPH. Hendrickson's curveball has little movement, and <b>sits</b> <b>around</b> 71-76 MPH. His changeup causes {{problems}} for Hendrickson, as the 82-84 MPH velocity does not differ enough from his fastball. Hendrickson's cutter is his best pitch and it <b>sits</b> <b>around</b> 82-87 MPH.|$|R

25|$|Sharkey's lack of {{physical}} vigor precluded Sharkey from {{joining in the}} sports of other children. Yet she enjoyed companionship, and often attracted a circle of little friends, who would <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> her for hours, listening to her stories, improvised as rapidly as she could utter them. That rapidity of thought and facility of expression were characteristic of her maturer years. She began a sketch {{of one or more}} columns and usually finished it at one sitting. With increasing years, her health grew better, so that she entered school, but left at the age of 15 to marry.|$|E

25|$|Eugene Nagel {{became aware}} of Pantridge's work in 1967. He {{believed}} that the physician-staffed model of prehospital care {{was not going to}} work for the United States in general or for Miami in particular. Physicians were too expensive to <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> fire stations waiting for calls, and if they had to be picked up in hospitals, it would take too long to arrive at the scene. When Nagel or his colleague James Hirschman, rode on the ambulance themselves they could, of course, defibrillate and provide medications, but they could not be present on all shifts. Nagel became convinced {{it was time to move}} away from a program using physicians to one staffed by paramedics.|$|E
25|$|The {{chapter house}} is of {{exceptional}} quality {{and in a}} good state of preservation. It is fronted by three heavily decorated round arches of the late 13th century, the larger centre arch a doorway and the flanking arches originally windows. The shafts between were built with carved capitals, {{but a series of}} sculptures of saints was added to them in the 14th century. The chapter house was substantially remodelled in the 16th century, perhaps subsequent to the complaints about its condition under Abbot Pontesbury. There is no trace of the original seating, which would have allowed the canons to <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> the walls of the building. The chapter house was demolished after the dissolution, apart from the western arches and south side, with another building taking its place. This was fitted with an impressive moulded, wooden ceiling, probably moved from another part of the abbey. This remains in place. The parlour would have been next to the chapter house but nothing remains of it.|$|E
25|$|Manobos {{occupied}} hinterland areas we {{now call}} Davao. Originally, they either wrapped the corpse in mat and bamboo slats to hang up on the tree or laid the dead on an elevated station (such as platform) beside the trees. Placing the body on an elevated place was believed to help the dead’s soul reach the heaven. However, after the Americans introducing Abaca plantation system in the 20th century, the custom changed to burying the corpse under the house. Due to the plantation, it became impossible to simply move out from their places like how they did before. For Ata-Manobos occupying the forest areas of Davao, have the unique superstition in teaching Antuk (riddles) other than for wake ceremony will bring misfortune. So in Ata-manobos’ joyful wake custom, close people of the deceased gather and <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> the corpse (in laid down position) and chat, tell stories, sing, dance, play instruments and more to elevate the atmosphere of grief.|$|E

25|$|Several {{scenes are}} also {{omitted from the}} director's cut, {{including}} one where the knights <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> a camp fire asking about their intended Sarmatian life, in which Bors reveals that his children do not even have names, most simply have numbers. In addition, a sex scene between Guinevere and Arthur is shifted to be chronologically before he is informed of the incoming Saxons towards Hadrian's Wall. This seemingly minor change arguably helps the story flow more smoothly. In the original film he is seen in full battle armour, contemplating a broken image of Pelagius on his floor, and then is disturbed by a call to come outside. When he comes outside, he is hastily putting on a shirt, and his hair is disheveled. In the Director's Cut, after an intimate moment between Arthur and Guinevere explaining Arthur's morals, they carry on into their sexual encounter, and are thus disturbed so that Arthur can be briefed on the Saxons. During the sexual encounter, he is wearing the same outfit he wears during the briefing. The scene where he is examining Pelagius's image is removed.|$|E
25|$|Locals {{tell the}} story of the specters of three cursed virgins that live on the Schlößleinsbuck. Two of them are dressed {{completely}} in white, but the third one wears a black skirt. The three virgins appeared to a farm laborer, who tilled a field near the mountain. They begged him to follow them into the mountain to release them and that because he is of pure heart, he need not fear the evil forces of darkness. They told him that on the way into the mountain they would first meet six men who have beards to the floor and <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> a table. In the second room there would be sat a black dog with fervid eyes, holding a key in its mouth. The farm laborer should take this key, even if the dog is spitting fire. With this key would then be able to get into a chamber containing a great treasure, which would then belong to him. But the farm laborer became very scared and left the virgins unsaved. It is further told that the virgins still speak to brave men, who should follow them into the mountain in order to save them.|$|E
25|$|Drums {{are highly}} {{influential}} in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums {{and how to}} play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui type of water drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.|$|E
