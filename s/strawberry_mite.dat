40|$|Organic {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} growing is increasing world-wide, but knowledge concerning best practice is generally empirical rather than field-based. This thesis extends knowledge concerning best practice in Swedish organic strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa (Duch)) production, which is usually based on a two-year crop. A series of four field experiments were conducted at Rånna Experimental Station (58 ° 27 ’N, 13 ° 51 ’E) on the strawberry cultivars ‘Honeoye’, ‘Cavendish’ and ‘Korona’. Specific objectives were to investigate: the effects of different organic fertilisers combined with degradable plastic mulch on plant establishment, yield and nitrogen mineralisation in soil; the efficiency of biological pest control using a predatory mite against strawberry mites (Phytonemus pallidus); innate within-field dispersal capacity of strawberry mite; the effects of pyrethrum combined with fleece covering on damage by strawberry blossom weevil (Anthonomus rubi). Plant establishment measured as fruit yield was improved by 60 % when degradable plastic mulch was used, probably through more flowers being initiated. Additional applications of organic fertiliser during the cropping period {{had little effect on}} yield. Biological control using the predatory mite Neoseiulus cucumeris reduced <b>strawberry</b> <b>mite</b> populations by up to 50 % but there was no increase in yield. It was difficult to draw clear conclusions from the <b>strawberry</b> <b>mite</b> dispersal pilot study, but mites tended to move more easily along planted rows than between rows. Pyrethrum alone had no visible effect on flower bud damage by strawberry blossom weevil but when combined with fleece covering it reduced the number of ‘Honeoye’ buds damaged by weevils by approximately 10 %. This was followed by a corresponding increase in cultivar yield. Similar effects were not recorded in the other cultivar examined. The study identified the following practical consequences for organic strawberry production: • Choice of pest-resistant cultivars is extremely important for success. • Use of clean plants and an efficient predatory species is essential in controlling mite infestations. • Use of degradable plastic mulching is recommended. • Fleece covering is recommended for protecting some cultivars against strawberry blossom weevils. • Only an initial starter fertilisation is required. • Use of pyrethrum is not recommended...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>strawberry</b> spider <b>mite</b> Tetranychus turkestani Ugarov & Nikolskii is an {{important}} pest of greenhouse cucumber. Reproductive parameters, life expectancy and life table entropy of this mite on six greenhouse cucumber cultivars (Puia, Hedieh, Milad Jadid, Milad Ghadim, Khasib and Negin) were evaluated. These parameters were estimated by a leaf disc bioassay with six treatments and 40 replications under laboratory conditions (Tempt. 28 +/- 1 °C, RH: 60 +/- 5 %, L:D = 16 : 8 h) in a walk-in growth chamber. The {{results of this study}} show that the highest total fecundity of the <b>strawberry</b> spider <b>mite</b> was observed on the Hedieh cultivar (29. 784 egg/ female) and the lowest on the Puia cultivar (15. 773 egg/ female). The highest gross and net fecundity rates of this pest were seen on the Hedieh cultivar (91. 721 and 41. 171 egg/female) and the lowest on the Puia cultivar (35. 765 and 9. 154 egg/female, respectively). The <b>strawberry</b> spider <b>mite</b> had the highest gross and net fertility rates on the Hedieh cultivar (44. 913 and 26. 720 egg/ female, respectively). Moreover, T. turkestani gross hatching rate on the six cucumber cultivars differed significantly, varying from 0. 18 on Negin to 0. 48 on Hedieh. The life expectancy of one-day-old adults of the <b>strawberry</b> spider <b>mite</b> was estimated to be 6. 140, 7. 800, 5. 733, 6. 551, 6. 543 and 6. 822 days on the above-mentioned cultivars, respectively. The values of the entropy parameter (H) of the <b>strawberry</b> spider <b>mite</b> on the cultivars were 6. 600, 1. 177, 8. 468, 2. 300, 1. 249 and 0. 247, respectively. These results suggest that Puia, Milad Jadid, Milad Ghadim, Khasib and Negin cultivars may have the highest resistance levels to this mite compared to the Hedieh cultivar.

40|$|Until 2008 {{methyl bromide}} (MeBr) {{was used in}} The Netherlands for {{fumigation}} of strawberry runners, intended as mother planting stock, to make them free of contamination by <b>strawberry</b> tarsonemid <b>mites</b> (Phytonemus pallidus). As an alternative of MeBr fumigation a 48 h CATT method was developed and scaled up by Wageningen UR {{in cooperation with the}} plant propagating association Plantum. This results in an excellent disinfection and a mortality of 99. 8 % of the <b>strawberry</b> tarsonemid <b>mite.</b> This method provides a healthy production of highly qualified strawberry runners in the field. From 2009 CATT is up scaled to a commercial level and widely applied by Dutch nurseries. In 2011 this CATT method was successfully modified to eradicate also root knot nematodes Meloidogyne hapla (> 99. 7 % mortality), which was not effectively controlled by MeBr fumigation. For an effective killing of the root knot nematodes, temperature must be raised to 40 °C. In several experiments the optimum for a high mortality of both tarsonemids and nematodes was studied. This leads into an adapted CATT of 20 hours at a temperature of 35 °C and 50 % CO 2 followed by 20 hours at a temperature of 40 °C.

40|$|Organic {{field trials}} with the {{strawberry}} cultivars Honeoye and BF 949603 (from Balsgård) were performed both in tunnel and outdoor at Rånna Experimental Station, Skövde 2006 - 2008. In tunnel, {{there were three}} treatments for control of powdery mildew, Podosphaera aphanis: sulphur, a test product from Koppert, rape seed oil in 2007 and AQ 10 (Ampelomyces quisqualis) in 2008, and two organic fertilizers, Binablå (6. 3. 12) and Vinass (4. 0. 9). In 2007 the percentage of fruits damaged by powdery mildew was significantly lowest in the treatment with sulphur. However, {{there were no significant}} differences between class 1 fruits or total yield. In 2006 and in 2008 there was no powdery mildew on the fruits. The two fertilizers yielded equally but Vinass had significantly more discarded fruits in 2008. There were no occurrences of grey mould, mites or trips in the tunnel production. In the outdoor production, treatments with and without the predatory mite Neuseiulus cucumeris for the control of the <b>strawberry</b> <b>mite,</b> Phytonemus pallidus, with and without net fence to control of the strawberry blossom weevil, Anthonomus rubi and two organic fertilizers, Binablå and Vinass, were compared. The results showed significant fewer strawberry mites on plants treated with predatory mites in the cultivar Honeoye all three years. Using of net (mesh size 1. 4 mm) did not fence out the strawberry weevils but the improved micro climate inside the net resulted in a higher yield both 2007 and 2008. There were no differences in yield between fertilizers. A demonstration trial has been conducted in a commercial tunnel production in Lidköping. Bio-control of the strawberry mites with the predatory mite, N. cucumeris was introduced in 2006 and 2007 with very positive results. Release of the predatory mites twice and three times seasonally resulted in no capture of strawberry mites in 2007. Tunnel production of soft fruits is slowly increasing in West Sweden. There is a need of more examples of successful growers that earn money from tunnel production. The strawberry producer in Lidköping is convinced of that tunnels are needed for an extended season. Conclusions * Release of predatory mite, N. cucumeris, in April, May and July, gives good control of the <b>strawberry</b> <b>mite,</b> P. pallidus, and higher yield of the two first crops in Honeoye * The organic fertilizers Binablå (6. 3. 12) and Vinass (4. 0. 9) gives the same yield in the cultivars Honeoye and BF 949603 when used at the same nitrogen level, both in tunnel and outdoor. * Net fence, mesh size 1. 4 mm, is not efficient enough to exclude strawberry blossom weevils Powdery mildew, P. aphanis, is a big problem on strawberries in tunnels during spring. The temperature and humidity is of crucial importance for the level of infestation. * Organic production of strawberries in tunnels is possible if the climate can be regulated sufficientl...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSelected {{life history}} {{characteristics}} of the <b>strawberry</b> spider <b>mite</b> (Tetranychus turkestani Ugarov and Nikolski, Acarina: Tetranychidae) were studied at four constant temperatures (15, 20, 25 and 30 °C). Egg-to-adult developmental time of females ranged from 50. 11 +/- 0. 79 days at 15 °C to 7. 73 +/- 0. 14 days at 30 °C. An average of 140. 33 +/- 5. 49 degree-days was required to complete development above the lower thermal threshold (11. 89 °C). Preimaginal mortality was 62. 92, 16. 67, 41. 82 and 42. 31 % at 15, 20, 25 and 30 °C, respectively. Mean longevity of female T. turkestani ranged from 30. 22 +/- 2. 88 days at 15 °C to 5. 78 +/- 0. 10 days at 30 °C. Mean total fecundity ranged from 23. 11 +/- 3. 14 to 49. 95 +/- 5. 54 eggs / female. The sex ratio (% females) ranged from 69. 00 +/- 0. 04 to 83. 01 +/- 0. 02 %. The intrinsic rate of population increase (rm) ranged from 0. 272 +/- 0. 010 at 30 °C to 0. 033 +/- 0. 002 (female per female per day) at 15 °C.

40|$|<b>Strawberry</b> tarsonemid <b>mite</b> (Phytonemus pallidus) is {{a severe}} pest in the {{production}} of strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa). The presence of tarsonemid mites in plant material results in a considerable loss of production. Until 2007 the Netherlands mother planting stock for runner production was treated with methyl bromide (MeBr) to eliminate tarsonemids. This chemical disinfestation method is banned from 2008. During recent years research is carried out to replace MeBr preferably by a non-chemical method. After screening a wide range of non chemical disinfestation methods, in 2007 the choice was made to optimize the controlled atmosphere (CA) treatment. Mortality of the tarsonemid mites was over 99. 5 % when CA-treatment during 48 hours was combined with a temperature of 35 °C. CA-treatment can have a slightly negative effect on plant vigour. Compared to the standard MeBr gas fumigation the CA-treatment is at the same level. In 2008 promising results are obtained with up scaling CA-treatment. From 2009 CAtreatment is applied on a large scale by Dutch growers and is replacing MeBr for eliminating tarsonemids in planting stock...|$|R

The study was performed on strawberry crop, „Splendor‟ and „Camarosa‟ cultivars, using the high tunnel and outdoor methods. Floristic and acarological surveys were carried out monthly, from December 2008 to July 2009, in the Ribatejo region. Thirty-three and 18 weed species were identified using the outdoor and the high tunnel method, respectively. Seven mite species were identified on the strawberries, being the most important the phytophagous Tetranychus cinnabarinus and the predaceous Amblyseius californicus, present in both strawberry cultivars and methods. From the 33 weed species identified, 19 were hosts of mites with agricultural interest. Tetranychids and phytoseiids were predominant, especially Tetranychus cinnabarinus, very polyphagous, found on 15 weed species, Phytoseiulus persimilis on seven and Amblyseius californicus on four.
