Feminists critical of the {{sex industry}} generally <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support {{at least part of}} {{the sex industry}} argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality.|$|E

The Apology Bill is thus seen as a means of acknowledging historical grievances that they believe are valid. Some also see it as a step towards identifying Native Hawaiians as an indigenous people to preserve for them specific legal rights based on ancestry; some also <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> beginning of a process to provide compensation or reparation to native Hawaiians for alleged past injustices.|$|E

500|$|Tristan {{is often}} granted {{a special place}} in musical history; many <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of the move away from conventional harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the 20th century. Wagner felt that his musico-dramatical theories were most perfectly realised in this work with its use of [...] "the art of transition" [...] between dramatic elements and the balance achieved between vocal and orchestral lines. Completed in 1859, the work was given its first performance in Munich, conducted by Bülow, in June 1865.|$|E

Decades later Eddy wrote that, {{on the third day}} after the fall, she had been helped by reading a certain Bible passage. In several editions of Science and Health she {{identified}} it as Mark 3, but later said that it had been Matthew 9:2–8, a passage about Jesus healing the paralytic at Capernaum: [...] "As I read, the healing Truth dawned upon my sense; and the result was that I rose, dressed myself, and ever after was in better health than I had before enjoyed." [...] The physician who treated her at the time, Alvin M. Cushing, swore in an affidavit in 1907 that the injury had not been a serious one, and that Eddy had responded to morphine and a homeopathic remedy; she had not said anything to him about a miraculous healing.|$|E
500|$|In The Speaker, A.B.Walkley {{admired the}} play {{and was one of}} few to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{culmination}} of Wilde's dramatic career. He denied the term [...] "farce" [...] was derogatory, or even lacking in seriousness, and said [...] "It is of nonsense all compact, and better nonsense, I think, our stage has not seen." [...] H.G.Wells, in an unsigned review for the Pall Mall Gazette, called Earnest one of the freshest comedies of the year, saying [...] "More humorous dealing with theatrical conventions {{it would be difficult to}} imagine." [...] He also questioned whether people would fully see its message, [...] "...how Serious People will take this Trivial Comedy intended for their learning remains to be seen. No doubt seriously." [...] The play was so light-hearted that many reviewers compared it to comic opera rather than drama. W. H. Auden later called it [...] "a pure verbal opera", and The Times commented, [...] "The story is almost too preposterous to go without music." [...] Mary McCarthy, in Sights and Spectacles (1959), however, and despite thinking the play extremely funny, would call it [...] "a ferocious idyll"; [...] "depravity is the hero and the only character." ...|$|E

According to a 2014 survey commissioned by Variety, PewDiePie {{along with a few}} other YouTube personalities have been reported to be more influential and popular than mainstream celebrities, such as Jennifer Lawrence, among US teenagers aged 13 through 18. His rise to fame has been used as [...] "a great example of how the emerging society gives extensive opportunities to individuals with great ideas, courage, and, of course, a significant portion of luck as opposed to the old society." [...] Studies of the gaming community on YouTube have shown that 95% of gamers engage in watching online videos related to gaming, which has been linked to be an important reason for PewDiePie's popularity. In 2015, PewDiePie was included on Time's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet, cementing his influence as an internet personality. Later in 2015, PewDiePie was featured on the cover of Varietys [...] "Famechangers" [...] issue, with the magazine ranking him as the [...] "#1 Famechanger", or [...] "those whose influence stands head and shoulders above the rest". The following year, Time included him on their Time 100 list, with South Park co-creator Trey Parker writing in his entry, [...] "I know it might seem weird, especially to those of us from an older generation, that people would spend so much time watching someone else play video games [...] But I choose to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> birth of a new art form.

[...] In June 2017, Forbes released a quarterly [...] "Top Influencers" [...] list, ranking PewDiePie at #2 in the Gaming gategory behind Markiplier. Forbes cited their reasoning for the ranking, writing, [...] " [...] overall brand suffered earlier this year when he included anti-Semitic content in nine of his videos." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1869 The Precipice, a {{story of}} the romantic rivalry among three men, condemning {{nihilism}} as subverting the religious and moral values of Russia, was published in Vestnik Evropy. Later critics came to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> final part of a trilogy, each part introducing a character typical of Russian high society of a certain period: first Aduev, then Oblomov, and finally Raisky, a gifted man, his artistic development halted by [...] "lack of direction". According to scholar S. Mashinsky, as a social epic, The Precipice was superior to both A Common Story and Oblomov.|$|E

2500|$|Criticism that Latin America is {{the birthplace}} and {{cornerstone}} {{of all things}} magic realist is quite common. Ángel Flores does not deny that magical realism is an international commodity but articulates {{that it has a}} Hispanic birthplace, writing that [...] "Magical realism is a continuation of the romantic realist tradition of Spanish language literature and its European counterparts." [...] Flores is not alone on this front; there is argument between those who see magical realism as a Latin American invention and those who <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> global product of a postmodern world. Irene Guenther concludes, [...] "Conjecture aside, it is in Latin America that [...] was primarily seized by literary criticism and was, through translation and literary appropriation, transformed." [...] Magic realism has taken on an internationalization: dozens of non-Hispanic writers are categorized as such, and many believe that it truly is an international commodity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nature of}} the {{contacts}} between the Thule, Dorset and Norse cultures is not clear, but may have included trade elements. The level of contact is currently the subject of widespread debate, possibly including Norse trade with Thule or Dorsets in Canada or possible scavenging of abandoned Norse sites (see also Maine penny). No Norse trade goods are known in Dorset archaeological sites in Greenland; the only Norse items found have been characterized as [...] "exotic items". Carved screw threads on tools and carvings with beards found in settlements on the Canadian Arctic islands show contact with the Norse. Some stories tell of armed conflicts between, and kidnappings by, both Inuit and Norse groups. The Inuit may have reduced Norse food sources by displacing them on hunting grounds along the central west coast.

40|$|The {{normative}} {{dimension of}} the notion of poverty, and its embedding in the long history of cultures, is largely overlooked in contemporary political discourse.

6000|$|But on {{the other}} hand it is equally clear that the {{doctrine}} of [...] "every man for himself," [...] {{as it used to be}} applied, is done with forever. The time has gone by when a man shall starve asking in vain for work; when the listless outcast shall draw his rags shivering about him unheeded of his fellows; when children shall be born in hunger and bred in want and broken in toil with never a chance in life. If nothing else will end these things, fear will do it. The hardest capitalist that ever gripped his property with the iron clasp of legal right relaxes his grasp a little when he thinks of the possibilities of a social conflagration. In this respect five years of war have taught us more than a century of peace. It has set in a clear light new forms of social obligation. The war brought with it conscription--not as we used to <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> last horror of military tyranny, but as the crowning pride of democracy. An inconceivable revolution in the thought of the English speaking peoples has taken place in respect to it. The obligation of every man, according to his age and circumstance, to take up arms for his country and, if need be, to die for it, is henceforth the recognized basis of progressive democracy.|$|E
60|$|There are two {{equal and}} eternal {{ways of looking}} at this {{twilight}} world of ours: we may <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> twilight of evening or the twilight of morning; we may think of anything, down to a fallen acorn, as a descendant or as an ancestor. There are times when we are almost crushed, not so much with the load of the evil as with the load of the goodness of humanity, when we feel that we are nothing but the inheritors of a humiliating splendour. But there are other times when everything seems primitive, when the ancient stars are only sparks blown from a boy's bonfire, when the whole earth seems so young and experimental that even the white hair of the aged, in the fine biblical phrase, is like almond-trees that blossom, like the white hawthorn grown in May. That it is good for a man to realize that he is 'the heir of all the ages' is pretty commonly admitted; it is a less popular but equally important point that it is good for him sometimes to realize that he is not only an ancestor, but an ancestor of primal antiquity; it is good for him to wonder whether he is not a hero, and to experience ennobling doubts as to whether he is not a solar myth.|$|E
60|$|I have no {{intention}} of taking the reader with me through college, where I remained the usual term of four years. These four years were not idled away, as sometimes happens, but were fairly improved. I read all of the New Testament, in Greek; several of Cicero's Orations; every line of Horace, Satires and Odes; four books of the Iliad; Tully de Oratore, throughout; besides paying proper attention to geography, mathematics, and other of the usual branches. Moral philosophy, in particular, was closely attended to, senior year, as well as Astronomy. We had a telescope that showed us all four of Jupiter's moons. In other respects, Nassau might be called the seat of learning. One of our class purchased a second-hand copy of Euripides, in town, and we had it in college all of six months; though it was never my good fortune to <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> young man who owned it, was not much disposed to let profane eyes view his treasure. Nevertheless, I am certain the copy of the work was in college; and we took good care to let the Yale men hear of it more than once. I do not believe they ever saw even the outside of an Euripides. As for the telescope, I can testify of my own knowledge; having seen the moons of Jupiter as often as ten times, with my own eyes, aided by its magnifiers. We had a tutor who was expert among the stars, and who, it was generally believed, {{would have been able to}} see the ring of Saturn, could be have found the planet; which, as it turned out, he was unable to do.|$|E
