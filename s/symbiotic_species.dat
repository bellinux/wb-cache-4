In fact, many families, including the Melanocetidae, Himantolophidae, Diceratiidae, and Gigantactinidae, show no evidence of male symbiosis. Females in some of these species contain large, developed ovaries and free-living males have large testes, suggesting these sexually mature individuals may spawn during a temporary sexual attachment that does not involve fusion of tissue. Males in these species also have well-toothed jaws that are far more effective in hunting than those seen in <b>symbiotic</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E

40|$|The species-specific host-recognition {{system of}} anemonefish was {{examined}} experimentally, {{with a particular}} focus on the function of imprinting using naive Amphiprion ocellaris juveniles. Anemonefish parents lay their eggs very close to their host anemone so the eggs are almost always touched by the host's body or tentacles. Here, we demonstrate the embryonic and immediate post-hatching learning of chemical cues via the parents' host in A. ocellaris through a host-exchange experiment with egg batches during hatching. The memory obtained from such imprinting operates {{at the time when}} juveniles first search for their hosts. Unexpectedly, innate recognition was found to exist not only in the <b>symbiotic</b> host <b>species</b> but also weakly in two non-partner species. Innate recognition alone is not sufficient. Imprinting via the parents' host complements innate recognition, leading to rigid species-specific host recognition. Imprinting by the parents' single host provides a sufficient cue for reaching the two host species. Furthermore, when combined with imprinting, innate recognition of non-partners serves to supplement the recognition of those species, leading to substitute partnerships that are only observed in some localities. Potential functions of imprinting in the host-recognition system are discussed. The “spare recognition hypothesis” and the necessity of clear distinctions between <b>symbiotic</b> and substitute <b>species</b> are also proposed here...|$|R

50|$|Approximately 200 {{different}} compounds, {{which have}} not been found in any other <b>symbiotic</b> <b>species,</b> have been extracted from lichens in the past 50 years.

Lichenin is identical chemically to amylose from starch grains, although it differs physically. The properties of lichenin support the use of lichens as raw materials in pastries, confectionaries, food, and the production of alcohol. Lichen is also used as a food for certain invertebrates such as mites, caterpillars, earwigs, black termites, and slugs and snails. The snails Chondria avenacea and Pyramidula rupestris feed on crustose forms such as Verrucaria and Protoblastenia.|$|E
50|$|Cantao ocellatus is {{a species}} of shield bug in the family Scutelleridae found across Asia. Reddish or ochre in overall colour it has dark legs and bluish black antennae.

50|$|The {{food web}} in the {{rhizosphere}} {{can be considered}} as three different channels with two different sources of energy; the detrius dependent channels are fungi and bacterial species and the root energy dependent channel consists of nematodes, <b>symbiotic</b> <b>species,</b> and some arthropods. This food web is constantly in flux as the amount of detrius available and the rate of root sloughing changes as roots grow and age. This bacterial channel {{is considered to be a}} faster channel because of the ability of species to focus on more accessible resources in the rhizosphere and have faster regeneration times compared with the fungal channel. All three of these channels are also interrelated to the roots that form the base of the rhizosphere ecosystem and the predators, such as the nematodes and protists, that prey upon many of the same species of mircroflora.|$|E

This orifice is large and is covered by an operculum The entire structure is characteristic of the Aleyrodidae and within the family it is taxonomically diagnostic because it varies in shape according to the species. Within the orifice beneath the operculum there is a tongue-like lingula.

Given that most host larvae must initially acquire their symbionts from the environment, viable Symbiodinium cells occur outside the host.

The use of aposymbiotic host polyps deployed as [...] "capture vessels" [...] {{and the application of}} molecular techniques has allowed for the detection of environmental sources of Symbiodinium.

The Mycenaceae family constitutes prominent fungal partners of G. pubilabiata and two other Gastrodia species, G. confusa and G. nipponica (Ogura-Tsujita et al. 2009; Kinoshita et al. 2016).

In our study, the fungal isolates were highly homologous to the symbiotic fungi of G. nipponica and G. elata, indicating that the <b>symbiotic</b> Mycena <b>species</b> that we detected may be associated with several Gastrodia species. Furthermore, the F 69 isolate was 99 % homologous to a symbiotic fungus from adult G. pubilabiata plants, suggesting that a single Mycena species may be present throughout the entire life cycle of G. pubilabiata, in contrast to the situation in G. elata, in which the fungal partner shifts from Mycena to Armillaria as seedling development proceeds (Xu and Guo 2000).|$|R
