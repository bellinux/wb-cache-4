25|$|The {{breakthrough}} in nano-FTIR {{came upon the}} development of high-power broadband mid-IR laser sources, which provided large spectral irradiance in a sufficiently large bandwidth (mW-level power in ~1000cm-1 bandwidth) and enabled truly broadband nanoscale-resolved material spectroscopy capable of detecting even the weakest vibrational resonances. Particularly, {{it has been shown}} that nano-FTIR is capable of measuring molecular fingerprints which match well with far-field FTIR spectra, owing to the asymmetry of the nano-FTIR spectrometer that provides phase and thus gives access to the molecular absorption. Recently, the first nanoscale-resolved infrared hyperspectral imaging of a co-polymer blend was demonstrated, which allowed for the application of statistical techniques such as multivariate analysis – a widely used tool for heterogeneous <b>sample</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

500|$|Those {{opposed to}} {{collecting}} believe {{that much of}} current collecting is unnecessary, arguably motivated by the personal field scores of individuals or by competition between museums, rather than {{the result of a}} strict scientific rationale; that collecting, in extreme cases of species on the verge of extinction, can pose a threat to bird populations; and that in many cases in which the necessity of specimens is claimed, new technology such as digital photography and blood <b>sample</b> <b>analysis</b> of mist-netted individuals could instead be used. [...] Finally, at a time of rampant deforestation and species extinctions, scientists and conservationists should take the lead in providing an example to local people not to kill or hunt birds. Where other techniques not involving killing of a bird are feasible, to take a specimen is viewed by some as simply unethical. Proponents of collecting counter-argue that compared to the many millions of birds killed each year by habitat destruction, domestic cats, window strikes, and tower kills, scientists collect only a few thousand birds per year worldwide and populations will quickly recover from an episode of collecting as long as their habitat remains. Supporters of continued collecting also point to the greater scientific utility and legacy of museum specimens compared to blood samples or photographs, and argue that collecting for research offers the only source of avian mortality with a positive outcome for birds in terms of the biological knowledge gained. Although taking small blood samples from wild birds is often viewed as a harmless alternative to collecting, it reduces survival by as much as 33% and does not provide the benefits of a voucher specimen. Scientists have pointed out that bird populations represent renewable resources, and that scientific collecting represents only a tiny and non-additive proportion of annual bird mortality. [...] However, examples exist of species whose extinction was directly contributed to by museum collecting (e.g. Guadalupe caracara, ivory-billed woodpecker).|$|E

[...] The carbon could be from organisms, but this has not been proven. [...] This organic-bearing material was obtained by drilling 5 centimeters deep in a site called Yellowknife Bay into a rock called “Sheepbed mudstone”. [...] The samples were named John Klein and Cumberland.

2500|$|Mars – the Martian {{atmosphere}} contains 10 nmol/mol methane. The {{source of}} methane on Mars {{has not been}} determined. Recent research suggests that methane may come from volcanoes, fault lines, or methanogens, {{that it may be}} a byproduct of electrical discharges from dust devils and dust storms, or that it {{may be the result of}} UV radiation. In January 2009, NASA scientists announced that they had discovered that the planet often vents methane into the atmosphere in specific areas, leading some to speculate this may be a sign of biological activity below the surface. Studies of a Weather Research and Forecasting model for Mars (MarsWRF) and related Mars general circulation model (MGCM) suggests that methane plume sources may be located within tens of kilometers, which is within the roving capabilities of future Mars rovers. The Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in August 2012, can distinguish between different isotopologues of methane; but even if the mission determines that microscopic Martian life is the source of the methane, it probably resides far below the surface, beyond the rover's reach. Curiosity's <b>Sample</b> <b>Analysis</b> at Mars (SAM) instrument is capable of tracking the presence of methane over time to determine whether it is constant, variable, seasonal, or random, providing further clues about its source. The first measurements with the Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) indicated that there is less than 5 ppb of methane at the landing site. [...] The Mars Trace Gas Mission orbiter planned for launch in 2016 would further study Mars' methane and its decomposition products such as formaldehyde and methanol. Alternatively, these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means, such as serpentinization. [...] On July 19, 2013, NASA scientists reported finding [...] "not much methane" [...] (i.e., [...] "an upper limit of 2.7 parts per billion of methane") around the Gale Crater where the Curiosity rover landed in August 2012. and H2O of the Martian Atmosphere| journal = Science| volume = 341| issue = 6143| pages = 260–3| year = 2013| last1 = Webster | first1 = C.

On 16 December 2014, NASA reported the Curiosity rover detected a [...] "tenfold spike", likely localized, in the amount of methane in the Martian atmosphere.
