These new uniforms however feature a few {{modifications}} that were made to them. The most notable changes are to the logo and the cross tomahawks. The logo this time is the appropriate logo that the franchise used in 1957-65.

A rigid {{transform}} of the E 3 <b>space</b> into <b>itself</b> <b>stands</b> as {{the basis}} of a complete description of mechanical motions of solid bodies, where the orthogonal and normalized character (orthonormality) of the transform matrix are used as a postulate. However, the orthonormality is in fact a consequence of the condition of rigidity. The demonstration is outlined through the spectral analysis for application in the engineering of robots and astrodynamics. The problem posed is to directly find, in a general and confident manner, the elements of the rotation matrix when the direction and magnitude of the rotational displacement are given, which is an inverse design problem. Previously solved in 2 -D, this problem is now extended to 3 -D problems of mechanics and an implicit suggestion is made for the n-D mechanics...|$|R

I didn't remember my father as alive at all: the one thing I could recollect about him was the ghastly look of that dead body, stretched at full length on the library floor, with its white beard all dabbled in the red blood that clotted it.

40|$|More {{and more}} {{organizations}} are distinguishing themselves as an employer who can offer employee satisfaction and happiness to attract highly skilled workers. EDX, a small-sized IT firm {{is faced with}} the challenge of finding IT workers as it expands it business by hiring more employees. Due to a tight labor IT market, there is a great need for EDX to differ <b>itself</b> and <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> from the rest of IT companies in Denmark. The concept of employer branding, which has become a vital tool for this “war of talent,” could help EDX in attracting the workers they need. Similar to a consumer brand, the employer brand creates an image that makes people want to work for the firm. After the establishment of a brand by laying out all the attributes/offerings of EDX as an employer, this employer brand can then be used to inform all forms of communication, internal and external, that the organization engages in with potential and existing employees. They must also see to it that potential recruits will fit in the organization by communicating the brand honestly and establishing a set of values, characteristics and the demands of an organization.

50|$|Completed in 2005, {{the main}} {{buildings}} in the compound lay on a 38000 sq ft plot of land, much larger than those of nearby houses. Its perimeter was 12- to 18-foot (3.7 to 5.5 m) concrete walls topped with barbed wire, {{and there were two}} security gates. The compound had very few windows. Little more than five years old, the compound's ramshackle buildings were badly in need of repainting. The grounds contained a well-kept vegetable garden, rabbits, some 100 chickens and a cow. The house <b>itself</b> did not <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> architecturally from others in the neighbourhood, except for its size and exaggerated security measures; for example, the third-floor balcony had a 7-foot (2.1 m) privacy wall. Photographs inside the house showed excessive clutter and modest furnishings. After the American mission there was extensive interest in and reporting about the compound and its design. To date, the Pakistani government has not responded to any allegations as to who had built the structure.|$|R

50|$|Native Americans chose trees {{mainly from}} the {{hardwood}} family in their region. They most commonly shaped Oak and maple trees—due to their flexibility when young, and their permanence and ability to retain shape. They bent trees over to form an arch, and secured them to {{a stake in the}} ground or tied them to a large stone with a leather strap or vine. They left a new branch to grow skyward {{from the top of the}} arch, forming a new trunk. Eventually they removed the old trunk, leaving a knob, a distinctive characteristic of trail marker trees. In a culture based on hunting and gathering, the hunter was trained from childhood to recognize horizontal shapes in the forest in hopes that it was wild game. The distinctive horizontal characteristic made the trail marker tree easily recognizable. The shape <b>itself</b> not only <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> horizontally in a vertical world at approximately the height of game, but also was visible above snowfall in the Great Lakes region.|$|R
40|$|As {{this paper}} study how a brand can {{differentiate}} <b>itself</b> to <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> among the competitions for better growth opportunities, focus {{is given to}} two emerging trends in the market, the halal skincare and also functional skincare brand. Halal skincare stands for the skincare product that is permissible for Muslim consumption from the religious perspective. This trend is growing tremendously as Muslim is the second biggest religion {{in the world with}} high fertility rate. In skincare, the concept of halal would exclude the use of alcohol and pig-derives material in the product. This market amount to $ 46 billion in 2013 and is growing at 8 % annually. This undercapitalised halal skincare market with few competition provides good opportunities for a brand to grow and develop. The functional skincare on the other hand, is a trend emerged over time where products provide additional benefits on top of basic function. This skincare trend is basically driven by modern technology that leads to many innovations of these multi-featured products. Example of the additional benefits that will be the focus in this study are the anti-aging and the sun care protection. Both trends gained enough attention by demonstrating a strong growth in the respective segments. This study will provide a snapshot of the current growing trends in the market and provide the key steps to position and differentiate a brand in order to <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> against the competitors with reference to the halal and functional skincare. The key objective here is to understand the determination of the brand positioning through the analysis of competitors, the target consumer and formulation of own brand differentiations. As every brand will be given a variety of judgements by the consumers, it is essential that a brand is position properly {{in the mind of the}} consumer in order to be successful in the market...|$|R

Chris-Craft Industries and Warner Bros.

Spelling Premiere had launched in August 1994. All American Television considered as of November 1994 of launching a first run movie network with 22 movies. Chris-Craft subsidiary United Television then partnered with Paramount (by then recently merged with Viacom) to create the United Paramount Network (UPN), which launched in January 1995.

Concurrently, United left PTEN's parent, the Prime Time Consortium, to focus on UPN, leaving PTEN as primarily a syndicator of its remaining programs; the service shared affiliations with its respective parents' own network ventures (in some cases, resulting in PTEN's programming airing in off-peak time slots) until it finally folded in September 1997.|$|R
