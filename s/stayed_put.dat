5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it <b>stayed</b> <b>put,</b> she would remain unmarried.|$|E

25|$|As Sewol began sinking, the ferry's {{intercom}} system started ordering the passengers to <b>stay</b> <b>put,</b> alleging that moving was dangerous. The announcements {{were made by}} a communication officer, Kang Hae-seong, who had not consulted the manual before the broadcast. The announcements began broadcasting by at least 8:52a.m. and continued even when water began flooding passenger compartments. Other crew members corroborated this order, instructing passengers to <b>stay</b> <b>put.</b> Captain Lee also instructed passengers to <b>stay</b> <b>put</b> and did not change the order even {{as he was leaving}} the ship.|$|R

He also made at least one approach for the Sheffield Wednesday striker David Hirst, but manager Trevor Francis rejected all offers and the player <b>stayed</b> <b>put.</b> In the end, he paid £1million for 23-year-old Cambridge United striker Dion Dublin – his only major signing of the summer.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Greek Cypriot defensive line, the GEEF ordered the 226th battalion to mount a defensive line together with the 341st reserve battalion in order to delay the Turkish forces. The 226th battalion retreated at 21:00 to the south, while the 341st <b>stayed</b> <b>put.</b> The Turkish Air Force started hitting the retreating Greek forces and the Greek-Cypriot artillery battalions started retreating to the east as well. The 9th Tactical Group, even though it had been not attacked, faced the danger of encirclement from the south, and so started its retreat by 12:00. At 14:30 it had reached Famagusta.|$|E

25|$|The {{second time}} the party formed a government, again under the {{leadership}} of Carl Theodor Zahle, Munch became Minister of Defence. His long period in this office coincided with World War I. Denmark remained neutral throughout, which was entirely in accordance with the views of P. Munch and the foreign minister, Erik Scavenius. However many, including the King Christian X, considered Munch to be too soft on defence to hold this position during a time of crisis. But Munch <b>stayed</b> <b>put,</b> and loyally - indeed ironically, given his own bleak assessment of the feasibility of any territorial defence—oversaw the largest peacetime mobilisation in Danish history, as it had been envisaged in the Defence Bill of 1909.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1996, the Astros again nearly left Houston. By the mid-1990s, McLane (like McMullen before him) {{wanted his}} team {{out of the}} Astrodome and was asking the city to build the Astros a new stadium. When things did not {{progress}} quickly toward that end, he put the team up for sale. He had nearly finalized a deal to sell the team to businessman William Collins, who planned to move them to Northern Virginia. However, Collins was having difficulty finding a site for a stadium himself, so Major League owners stepped in and forced McLane to give Houston another chance to grant his stadium wish. Houston voters responded positively via a stadium referendum and the Astros <b>stayed</b> <b>put.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, many Northamptonshire {{fans who}} {{witnessed}} his career will be quicker {{to mention the}} one run that he didn't make rather than the 12,000 that he did. Against Richie Benaud's 1961 Australians, Northamptonshire mounted a spirited challenge after being left to score 198 for victory in {{two and a half}} hours, and Lightfoot's gallant half-century helped reduce the target to four runs off the final over. With one ball to go, the scores were level. Alan Davidson bowled to Malcolm Scott who missed, but set off for a bye to acting wicketkeeper Bobby Simpson; Lightfoot, inexplicably, <b>stayed</b> <b>put</b> at the non-striker's end, Scott was run out, and Australia escaped with a draw.|$|E

25|$|In 1592 the Zeelanders {{urged the}} States-General delegates to advance on Geertruidenberg, but the {{decision}} was overruled and Groningen was chosen as more important and as such the operations continued {{to cut off the}} city. Thus during Maurice's 1592 summer offensive two cities were besieged and captured - Steenwijk fell in July and Coevorden capitulated in September which resulted in Spanish held Groningen being strangled further {{by the end of the}} year. After the capture of both towns, this time the Frisians demanded that Groningen should be besieged. The States delegates however decided otherwise and in 1593 Geertruidenberg was chosen much to the Zealanders delight. The Frisians though were bitter and as a sign of protest they sent no troops to Geertruidenberg. This turned into a strategy that the Dutch played upon; the Frisian troops <b>stayed</b> <b>put</b> and this forced the Spanish to think that Groningen would be besieged thus leaving a sizeable garrison for the time being.|$|E
25|$|After {{moving to}} the borough in 1867, William and Thomas Hoopes (distant cousins of Josiah and Abner) {{established}} a spoke works. They purchased a site on Market Street from a coal yard operator and opened for business in September 1867, though they were not immediately successful. They invited their relative Edward S. Darlington to join the firm and began manufacturing complete sets of wheels in 1869. About a hundred men were employed in various capacities by the spoke works by 1872, such as cutting, hauling, and turning wood with circular saws. Exports of their products reached as far as Europe and the Pacific Coast. With the panic of 1873, profits suffered, and the firm accused the West Chester Railroad of price gouging. Despite threatening to move the factory to Chester or Philadelphia, the Hoopes Brothers & Darlington (as the firm was known) <b>stayed</b> <b>put</b> and the business recovered by 1880. The firm merged with 14 other companies to form the American Wheel Company in 1889, but the Hoopes Brothers and Darlington bought out their share in 1892. The company began producing wooden bicycle wheels in 1894.|$|E
25|$|So {{the layout}} <b>stayed</b> <b>put,</b> {{although}} in 1823-4 Schinkel {{did get to}} rebuild the Potsdam Gate. Formerly {{little more than a}} gap in the customs wall, it was replaced by a much grander affair consisting of two matching Doric-style stone gate-houses, like little temples (a nod to Friedrich Gilly perhaps), facing each other across Leipziger Straße. The one on the north side served as the customs house and excise collection point, while its southern counterpart was a military guardhouse, set up to prevent desertions of Prussian soldiers, which had become a major problem. The new gate was officially dedicated on 23 August 1824. The design also included a new look for Leipziger Platz. Attempts to create a market there to draw off some of the frenetic commercial activity in the centre of the city had not been successful. And so Schinkel proposed {{to turn it into a}} fine garden, although this part of the design was not implemented. It was a rival plan by gardener and landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenné (1789–1866), drawn up in 1826, that went ahead in 1828 but with modifications. In later years Lenné would completely redesign the Tiergarten, a large wooded park formerly the Royal Hunting Grounds, also give his name to Lennéstraße, a thoroughfare forming part of the southern boundary of the park, very close to Potsdamer Platz, and transform a muddy ditch to the south into one of Berlin's busiest waterways, the Landwehrkanal.|$|E

500|$|Abu Ali Iyad {{was part}} of the field command there along with al-Wazir. They headed a force of roughly 2,500 guerrillas in the hilly terrain around Ajlun and Jerash. Their {{position}} was vulnerable due to the ineffectiveness of Palestinian guerrilla warfare against Jordanian armor in open areas versus urban warfare in the cities and Palestinian refugee camps. Most of the PLO leadership, including Arafat and al-Wazir, and hundreds of guerrillas escaped Jordan in April 1971 following pressure from Arab states, confiscation of weapons by the Jordanian Army and the closing of PLO offices in Amman. Abu Ali Iyad refused to do so, however, and he and his Tiger Cubs <b>stayed</b> <b>put</b> in their Ajlun base where they continued to fight the Jordanian Army.|$|E
500|$|He {{opened his}} {{account for the}} 2008–09 season with a hat-trick in a 4–0 win over Cheltenham Town on 23 August. Stating his future ambitions as playing Championship {{football}} with Oldham, he was offered a new deal at the club on 30 December 2008. He was linked with a move to Doncaster Rovers in January 2009, but <b>stayed</b> <b>put</b> after talks with manager John Sheridan, who insisted Hughes was [...] "very happy" [...] at Oldham. In March 2009 it was widely reported that Hughes {{had been involved in}} a drunken brawl with Sheridan where Hughes was reported to have had him [...] "in a headlock". Sheridan later downplayed the incident as [...] "jovial", saying [...] "people have made things up". Sheridan was sacked, but insisted that the two incidents were not related, as [...] "it was results that cost me the job".|$|E
500|$|In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Tallon stumped Denis Compton, but {{the umpire}} gave him not out because [...] "the {{glare of the}} sun {{suddenly}} became so intense that {{he was unable to}} see clearly the white line of the popping crease" [...] and Compton made 147. The England openers Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook had put on 100 in the second innings when Tallon caught Washbrook, scooping up a ball from Lindwall. Washbrook [...] "stood there transfixed. Even some of the Australian leg-side fielders expressed amazement". Tallon was known for his impetuous appealing - [...] "he was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision" [...] - and this caused an umpiring controversy. But Tallon maintained the appeal and Bradman backed him. Washbrook told Wally Hammond that the ball had gone into the ground just before it went into Tallon's gloves and the England captain tried unsuccessfully to find a press photograph of the ball touching the ground. Later in the match Tallon missed a vital stumping off the England wicketkeeper Godfrey Evans, who <b>stayed</b> <b>put</b> for 95 minutes without making a run. Tallon stumped Compton again, but he was given not out and went on to make an unbeaten 103 in a match-saving stand of 85 with Evans.|$|E

500|$|His team {{exited the}} three cup {{competitions}} at the First Round in 2011–12, and {{after losing to}} non-league Grimsby Town in the FA Cup in a run of five games without a win – which included 388 minutes without scoring a goal – he signed Guy Madjo, Jennison Myrie-Williams and Shane O'Connor on loan. These proved to be inspired signings, as a Madjo hat-trick meant that the two Stevenage loanees scored {{a total of five}} goals between them in their first three games. However, in December he admitted that the club's off-the-field issues were a cause of concern for him and that he was being [...] "kept very much in the dark." [...] Nominated for the Manager of the Month award for three wins in four December games, Adams revealed that due to the club's precarious financial position he was unable to sign any new players or even retain his loan players in the January transfer window – despite the chairman having previously told him to draw up a list of transfer targets. He did though manage to sign Chris Shuker and Paul Marshall on non-contract terms. He would also have signed Chris Birchall, however before the deal was finalised the Football League placed the club under a transfer embargo after a tax bill went unpaid. The club were unable to pay the player's wages in February. The club entered administration on 9 March, ending what had been a genuine push for promotion; talks between the administrator and Adams did not seem constructive, as Adams told the press that he was [...] "taking legal advice". However, he <b>stayed</b> <b>put,</b> and steered the [...] "Valiants" [...] to a 12th-place finish; they would have been only 3 points off the play-offs had the club not entered administration.
