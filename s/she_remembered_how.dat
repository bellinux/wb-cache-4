2500|$|The success hasn't {{made life}} in the theatre any easier for Vertinskaya. <b>She</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> in Sovremennik (after Ophelia made her known internationally) she was shifted back to the mass scenes. Yevgeny Yevstigneev complained bitterly because the moment he (as the King in The Naked King) stepped on stage the {{audience}} responded in a hushed collective whisper: [...] "Look over there, it's Vertinskaya in the crowd!" [...] Occasionally, Vertinskaya remembered, she had to artificially [...] "simplify" [...] her facial features (even to stuff her nostrils) so as to fit the Soviet [...] "common heroine" [...] stereotype. [...] "In those times, they demanded {{a different kind of}} heroine: ruddy-faced cheerful 'activistkas'", – the actress responded when asked about huge gaps in her working schedule in the early 1970s.|$|E

60|$|Cynthia did {{not answer}} that, for <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> she, too, had exulted when she had {{believed}} him to have accomplished Isaac Worthington's downfall. Now that he had failed, {{and she was in}} his arms, it was not for her to judge--only to rejoice.|$|E

6000|$|... "It won't seem so hard by and by, dear," [...] said Anne, {{who always}} felt {{the pain of}} her friends so keenly {{that she could not}} speak easy, fluent words of comforting.

6000|$|... "No; it's only disputing, and bragging, the way {{children}} do. They {{want her}} to be an American, but she can't be anything but a Spaniard, she says. You see, her mother was always longing for home, po' thing! and thinking about it, and so the child is just as much a Spaniard as if she'd always lived there. <b>She</b> thinks <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>how</b> Spain looked, but I reckon she don't, because she was only a baby when they moved to France. She is very proud to be a Spaniard." ...|$|R
