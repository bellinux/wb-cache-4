40|$|At {{the end of}} September 2002 the Court of Auditors {{issued a}} report on 'the {{extensification}} premium payment schemes (EPS) in the Common Organisation of the Market in Beef and Veal'. The report found that while the EPS provides extra income to extensive beef farmers it does little to encourage additional extensive farming and it provides little incentive to intensive farmers to switch to more extensive methods. In part this {{is a consequence of}} the fact that two-thirds of EU beef is produced from the EU dairy herd. The Court also found that the Agenda 2000 reforms had weaknesses in them which allowed producers to benefit from the EPS by simply adjusting their <b>beef</b> <b>premium</b> application details rather than changing their pattern of production. Comment: The EPS scheme appears to have allowed increased levels of payment to EU beef farmers without materially changing production practices. This raises the question as to whether some of these 'greener' schemes are simply a mechanism for increasing levels of direct aid payments to EU beef farmers. At the end of September 2002 the Court of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The European Union {{reformed}} farm {{policy in}} June 2003 towards the decoupling of farm income support instruments. Available impact studies {{find that this}} reform reduces production incentives substantially for beef {{and to a lesser}} extent for arable crops. However, these studies assume that the previous reform, under Agenda 2000, already decoupled arable crop direct payments to a considerable extent, while <b>beef</b> <b>premiums</b> were linked more closely to production. Our main objective in this paper is to test the sensitivity of these results to this questionable modelling of Agenda 2000 direct payments, which neglects eligibility rules and land market imperfections. Our analysis reveals that the effects of the reform on both arable crop and beef production are always negative, however the Agenda 2000 direct payments are modelled. On the other hand, we show that, when the eligibility rules and land market imperfections are acknowledged, the production reducing effects may be much larger for arable crops than for beef.

40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} methodology to evaluate quantitatively non-tariff barriers impacts (technical and sanitary) on the quantities and prices of Brazilian beef foreign sales. The preliminary analysis was implemented {{for the period}} from January/ 1992 through December/ 2000, considering two specific markets: European Union market for <b>special</b> <b>beef</b> cuts (chilled or frozen) and the United States market for corned beef. The basic hypothesis considered was that technical/sanitary issues influence the Brazilian beef exportation. The impact of such influences is expected either on transaction volumes, prices or both. A reduced form model was built to explain the sales of external products. Intervention models were applied to the data set to obtain impact estimates directly on prices and quantities series and establish the intervention influence pattern. Results show that {{a great part of}} foreign sales (volume and price variations) were due to market fundamental variables. In the intervention model analysis for special cuts, the 1995 March point was significant, indicating a reduction effect on those product prices, for three months.

40|$|The {{state of}} Iowa has {{within a few}} years {{developed}} dairying in many counties {{to such an extent that}} great interest attaches to methods of feeding calves during the first four months of their lives, and until they have reached the age when grains, grasses and fodders will carry them on through the rearing period. Our farmers adopt various methods in calf raising. <b>Special</b> <b>beef</b> producers permit the calf to follow the dam until it is five or six months old, others yard the calves, and admit the cows twice a day. Those who want milk as a feature of profit resort to various methods. Some farmers require one cow to suckle two calves, while they milk the other cow. Others milk the cows, and after the calf has reached a certain age, varying with varying opinions of the proper time to stop feeding new milk, they raise the calf on skim milk, with different grains added. Still others, feed skim milk from the beginning, caring little for the calf, and relying for profit on the milk. What is most economical has not been demonstrated. The state has such great abundance of corn and other grains, such fine grasses and fodders that, the production of beef will always be a leading industry. It is also well settled that, the average farmer can not afford to give all of a cow’s milk for a year, to the raising of her calf, and cows that suckle seldom give milk long after the calf is removed. Our farmers who desire to make milk a profitable feature of the farm are leaning more and more to the belief that the calf must be raised by hand...|$|R
