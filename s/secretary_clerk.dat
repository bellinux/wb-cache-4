Neurotics Anonymous grew quickly in Minnesota, and by Fall of 1966 there were thirty active groups in the state.|$|E

When S.B. 631 was passed, $278,638 was appropriated for the remainder of fiscal year 1989-1990, and then $493,154 was appropriated for fiscal year 1990-1991.

5000|$|Philip Dottin Souper became Colonial Secretary of Trinidad under Ralph James Woodford, Governor from 1813. Woodford used {{very young}} {{officials}} for administrative work, and kept {{them on a}} short leash. It was noted that an attempt to bribe Souper was rejected. An 1834 report on the drive to reduce sinecures shows Souper taking on the dual roles of Secretary and Clerk of the Council. There were in fact three defined official roles, <b>Secretary,</b> <b>Clerk</b> and Register (or court intendant, often called escribando, a term inherited from the Spanish colonial time in Trinidad). In 1810, James Chapman, who held officially the three posts, had been listed as a sinecure holder using deputies for the functions.|$|E

Instead, the magistrate paid his secretaries from his own pocket, which he was expected to refill from local sources, and the other staff were expected to collect fees from those who were unlucky enough to come in contact with them. These fees might be arbitrary and extortionate, and in later dynasties corruption was widespread.|$|R

5000|$|During the First World War Marshall Bond {{was turned}} down for {{military}} service. As a substitute form of national service he joined the Counter Intelligence section of the United States Secret Service. In this office he did port watching to reduce sabotage and politically inspired work stoppage. His duties also included arresting enemy nationals, which included among them the German count Alvo von Alvensleben, who was the godson of Kaiser Wilhelm, and the Austrian count Karl-Kuno Josef Maria [...] "Rollo" [...] von Coudenhove, who before the war were co-investors in various mines including the Cassiar in British Columbia. Canada {{being a part of}} the British Commonwealth had declared war on Austria and Germany before the United States, and so they had come south. There was a suspicion that one or both were spies. After the war it developed that Alvensleben had supported the Canadians, Coudenhove had sided with Germany and Austria, but the actual spy rumored to be in the organization was probably the Cassiar company <b>secretary</b> <b>clerk</b> Joachim von Ribbentrop.|$|E
50|$|In the RCAF, women became clerks, drivers, photographers, air photo interpreters, weather observers, {{instrument}} mechanics, parachute riggers {{as well as}} staffing many {{administrative and}} technical positions. As a CWAC, women took over 21 types of army duties as <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks,</b> canteen workers, vehicle drivers and many other non-combat military jobs. As a CWREN, women served in 26 non-combatant occupations in Canadian naval bases at home or abroad.

50|$|Beneath the councilors {{were the}} <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks,</b> and {{accountants}} {{who ran the}} bureaucracy of the Duchy and adhered to a strict discipline and worked long hours. These men held no political power of their own, but often, this was the starting place for burghers looking to climb the ladder. <b>Secretaries</b> and <b>clerks</b> (Schreiber) copied and filed important documents for the various branches of the government. The growth of the central government's bureaucracy also meant the number of clerks growing from 25 in 1520 to over 80 {{by the end of}} the century. Accountants too grew in number, as the amount of bookkeepers (Buchhalter), charged with maintaining a general ledger to recording and writing summaries of votes cast in privy council meetings, would be expanded greatly to fill the needs of the government. Other low-level positions included the keeper of the treasury (Gewöhlbeverwater), who curated the goods of the treasury vault such as government archives, and the message supervisor (Botenmeister), who managed the couriers of the Duchy.|$|R

50|$|While at the Larkin Company, Hubbard {{pioneered the}} idea of {{mail-order}} merchandising. By offering premiums and bonuses in return for sales, the company was able to dispense with a sales force. By 1902, Larkin needed a building to consolidate offices scattered throughout all of his factories. Martin, who had risen to Treasurer and Corporate Secretary, and William Heath, Larkin's brother-in-law {{and the head of}} the Legal Department, suggested Frank Lloyd Wright. Larkin consented and Frank Lloyd Wright received his first commercial commission, the Larkin Administration Building which was completed in 1904 and accommodated 1800 corresponding <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks,</b> and executives.|$|R
5000|$|Dictation Court - {{the highest}} court in the land, it was divided into two Departments, {{respectively}} the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Penal Affairs. Every Department comprised a President, four associate Members, an assistant Member, a Registrar, all supported by <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks</b> and assistants. The Dictation Court also incorporated the Office of the Chief Prosecutor, who was assisted by a Deputy Chief Prosecutor, a secretary, an archivist and an assistant. The separate Departments of the Dictation Court could come together into a Unified Chamber, whose role was overseeing the fair distribution of justice and reviewing the performance of all judges.|$|R
5|$|During the French colonial administration, educated Vietnamese were {{employed}} in the civil service administration as <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks</b> and bureaucrats. When Cambodia gained independence in 1953, the Sihanouk-led government phased {{out most of the}} Vietnamese civil servants with Cambodians, and they sought employment in banks and commercial enterprises as secretaries and other office-based positions. In the 1960s, urban-dwelling Vietnamese with lower education backgrounds also worked as mechanics in car repair and machine shops owned by Chinese businessmen. Vietnamese immigrants that settled in the countryside worked as fishermen along the Tonle Sap lake and Mekong river, and also as rubber plantation workers in Kampong Cham and Kratie provinces.|$|R

Since women were not allowed to enter in combat of any kind the CWACs worked as <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks,</b> canteen workers, vehicle drivers and many other non-combat military jobs. They were only paid two-thirds of what the men were paid in the same occupation (this figure later became four-fifths).|$|R
50|$|Although the {{notarial}} {{office is}} unique, other {{officers of the}} Commonwealth are authorized to act as notaries in some respects.

50|$|The Film Exchange Building {{employed}} a large office staff that included salespeople, book keepers, <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks</b> and typists {{in addition to}} those in the shipping and receiving departments. Also, because of the fragile nature of film stock (thin reels of celluloid played on a movie projector), there was a large staff of inspectors employed. Before being shipped to another theater, the staff of inspectors diligently inspected the entire reel for any damages consisting of tears, scratches, damaged patches, and ripped sprocket holes. Most often the damages were entirely repaired onsite, with the cost being billed to the theater returning the movie reel. Some film stock was made out of nitrate which is very flammable, so those employees working with the film operated in fireproof rooms that had self-closing fireproof doors.|$|R

5000|$|In 1933, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the diplomats serving in the Auswärtiges Amt came from upper-class families with a disproportionate number coming from the aristocracy. The overrepresentation of aristocrats together with its overwhelming upper-class character gave the Auswärtiges Amt an elitist cache, and made the Auswärtiges Amt into one of the most prestigious institutions in Germany. Because of its upper-class composition, the diplomats could afford extremely expensive clothes, and the men of Auswärtiges Amt were generally considered to the best dressed officials in the entire German government, contributing to the Auswärtiges Amts glamorous, stylist image. There were no female diplomats, and besides for the women employed as <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks</b> and cleaners, the Auswärtiges Amt had no female employees. That the men of the Auswärtiges Amt formed an elitist group can be seen that every single diplomat had a university degree (before the 1950s, most Germans did not go to university). The requirement that one had to have a university degree to enter the Auswärtiges Amt effectively guaranteed upper-class dominance of the Auswärtiges Amt.|$|R
