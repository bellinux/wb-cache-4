40|$|A {{secondary}} {{immune response}} to the <b>soluble</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>protein</b> antigens I*BSA and I*BGG has been demonstrated when lymph node cells, largely lymphocytes with a few reticulo-endothelial and plasma cells, from previously immunized rabbits were transferred to x-radiated recipient rabbits, and the recipients then challenged with antigen. The total specific antibody synthesized by the transferred cells during the first 8 days of the secondary response amounted to approximately ⅔ of the wet weight of the transferred cells. In an attempt to elicit a primary response, lymph node cells were obtained from normal, non-immunized donors, and transferred to x-radiated recipients. No immune response was observed upon antigenic stimulation. When normal or previously immunized lymph node cells were incubated with antigen for periods up to 1 hour, washed and injected into recipients, no antibody production was observed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of B cells as antigen-specific antigen-presenting cells (APC) in self {{tolerance}} to low concentrations of soluble self proteins and in acquired tolerance to low doses of <b>soluble</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>protein</b> antigens. Experiments were performed in normal and B cell-deficient animals, and tolerance induction was measured by T cell proliferation assays. T cell proliferation was reduced in B cell-deficient mice, indicating that B cells {{may be involved in}} efficient activation of naive T cells in response to protein antigen both in vivo and in vitro. To study acquired tolerance induced by low doses of <b>soluble</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>protein</b> antigen, normal and B cell-deficient adult mice were injected intravenously with repeated low doses (10 μg) of deaggregated ovalbumin (OVA), and then challenged with OVA in complete Freund 2 ̆ 7 s adjuvant. In animals treated with deaggregated OVA, the in vitro proliferative responses of LN T cells to OVA were significantly reduced, and production of the Th 1 cytokine, IFN-γ, in response to OVA was lost. This occurred in both normal and B cell-deficient treated animals, indicating that B cell antigen presentation was not required for this phenomenon. B cells were also unnecessary for self tolerance of T cells to the transgenic self antigen, hen egg lysozyme (HEL), in a transgenic mouse strain with very low serum lysozyme concentration. Partial low zone tolerance induced by deaggregated, low-dose OVA was selective for the Th 1 response, as measured by in vitro proliferation and IL- 2 and IFN-γ production, because antibody responses of normal mice to this T cell-dependent antigen were largely unaffected. Both treated and untreated animals produced equivalent titers of anti-OVA antibodies, predominantly of the IgG 1 and IgG 2 b isotypes, following challenge with OVA in complete Freund 2 ̆ 7 s adjuvant. Tolerance to low levels of the transgenic HEL self protein in mice expressing different MHC molecules was also addressed. Transgenic mice that were H- 2 b/b in the class II region were not tolerant to the transgenic self protein, whereas transgenic mice of the H- 2 b/k were tolerant...|$|E
40|$|Immunodeficiency syndromes {{associated}} with protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) {{have been documented}} extensively, although to date the mechanism underlying these defects remains uncharacterized. In this study, we have evaluated T, B, and antigen-presenting cell functions of malnourished mice fed a 4 % protein diet compared with litter-mate controls fed a 20 % protein diet. Spleen cells from malnourished mice presented both <b>soluble</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>protein</b> and allogeneic MHC antigens less efficiently than control mice. However, T cells from malnourished animals demonstrated effective or enhanced specific T-cell activation when stimulated with allogeneic cells, while B cells from protein-deprived animals responded normally in proliferative responses to T-cell driven cognate and non-cognate, as well as mitogen, stimulation. To assess further antigen-presenting cell function, three requirements for successful antigen presentation were evaluated. First, the proliferation of the IL- 1 -dependent cloned T-cell line D 10 demonstrated a slight deficiency in IL- 1 production by malnourished splenic antigen-presenting cells, {{and the addition of}} saturating amounts of IL- 1 to the assay could partially reconstitute function. Second, quantitative cell-sorter analysis revealed minimal deficiencies of spleen-cell Ia expression. Third, antigen-processing function was assayed in vitro by using processed antigen fragments; no improvement in protein-deprived antigen-presenting function resulted. Together, these findings suggest that either decreased Ia glycoprotein expression on a critical subset of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or a quantitative deficiency in such a subset of cells, or both, underlie the defective antigen-presenting cell function observed in chronic protein deprivation (CPD) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{transfer}} of cells {{capable of producing}} antibody, from donor to homologous recipient anlmnls, is an accepted laboratory model {{for the study of}} the immune response. This technique was developed by Landsteiner and Chase in 1942 to investigate the cell types involved in the immune response (1). Most of the work has consisted of transferring cells, usually from lymphoid organs or the buffy coat of peripheral blood of hosts already stimulated by antigen to non-lmmunized recipients. Skin testing and/or serologic methods then demonstrated the presence of antibody in the recipients, much sooner than would be expected with a primary response in the recipients (2 - 10). P, ecenfly, antigenic stimulation of transferred cells in the recipient has been demonstrated using tetanus toxoid (11), and dysentery bacilli (12) as antigens. We have used the cell transfer technique in studying the response to <b>soluble</b> <b>foreign</b> serum <b>proteins</b> in order to: (a) find out how much antibody a known number of transferred cells can produce; (b) determine effects of time of administration and dose of antigen on the ability of the transferred cells to mak...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Antibody {{fragments}} are molecules {{widely used}} for diagnosis and therapy. A {{large amount of}} protein is frequently required for such applications. New approaches using folding reporter enzymes have recently been proposed to increase <b>soluble</b> expression of <b>foreign</b> <b>proteins</b> in Escherichia coli. To date, these methods have only been used to screen for proteins with better folding properties but have never been used to select from a large library of mutants. In this paper we apply one of these methods to select mutations that increase the soluble expression of two antibody fragments in the cytoplasm of E. coli. Results We used the β-galactosidase α-complementation system to monitor and evolve two antibody fragments for high expression levels in E. coli cytoplasm. After four rounds of mutagenesis and selection from large library repertoires (> 10 7 clones), clones exhibiting high levels of β-galactosidase activity were isolated. These clones expressed a higher amount of soluble fusion protein than the wild type in the cytoplasm, particularly in a strain deficient in the cytoplasmic Lon protease. The increase in the soluble expression level of the unfused scFv was, however, much less pronounced, and the unfused proteins {{proved to be more}} aggregation prone than the wild type. In addition, the soluble expression levels were not correlated with the β-galactosidase activity present in the cells. Conclusion This is the first report of a selection for soluble protein expression using a fusion reporter method. Contrary to anticipated results, high enzymatic activity did not correlate with the soluble protein expression level. This was presumably due to free α-peptide released from the protein fusion by the host proteases. This means that the α-complementation assay does not sense the fusion expression level, as hypothesized, but rather the amount of free released α-peptide. Thus, the system does not select, in our case, for higher soluble protein expression level but rather for higher protease susceptibility of the fusion protein. </p...|$|R

To investigate whether the <b>foreign</b> <b>protein</b> could be immobilized into the polyhedra of BmNPV, two recombinant baculoviruses were generated by a novel BmNPV polyhedrin-plus (polh+) Bac-to-Bac system, designated as vBmBac(polh+) -enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and vBmBac(polh+) -LacZ, which can express the polyhedrin and <b>foreign</b> <b>protein</b> simultaneously.

40|$|Abstract: A {{problem with}} the use of Escherichia coli to produce <b>foreign</b> <b>proteins</b> is that {{although}} endogenously produced acetate is physiologically indispensable, it in-hibits protein expression. Here we firstly employed an antisense RNA strategy as an elaborate metabolic engi-neering tool to partially block biosynthesis of two major acetate pathway enzymes, phosphotransacetylase (PTA) and acetate kinase (ACK). Three recombinant plasmids containing antisense genes targeting either or both of pta and ackA were constructed, and their effects on the acetate pathway and <b>foreign</b> <b>protein</b> productivity com-pared to control plasmid without any antisense genes were determined in E. coli BL 21. Green fluorescent pro-tein (GFP) was employed as a model <b>foreign</b> <b>protein,</b> and timing of antisense expression was controlled by using the intrinsic ackA promoter. We found that the antisense method partially reduced mRNA levels of target enzyme genes and, over time, lowered the concentration of ac-etate in culture media in all antisense-regulated strains. Notably, total production of GFP was enhanced 1. 6 - to 2. 1 -fold in antisense-regulated strains, even though the degree of acetate reduction was not significantly large. It was revealed that the acetate pathway has more critical roles in cellular physiology than expected in the previous reports. When the scale of culture was increased, en-hancement of protein production became larger, demon-strating that this antisense strategy can be successfully applied to practical large-scale protein production pro...|$|R
