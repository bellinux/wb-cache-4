50|$|<b>Somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> (SEPs or SSEPs) tests {{measure the}} {{electrical}} {{activity of the}} brain that results from the stimulation of touch. It is a useful, noninvasive means of assessing somatosensory system functioning. By combining SEP recordings at different levels of the somatosensory pathways, it is possible to assess the transmission of the afferent volley from the periphery up to the cortex. SEP components include a series of positive and negative deflections that can be elicited by virtually any sensory stimuli. For example, SEPs can be obtained in response to a brief mechanical impact on the fingertip or to air puffs. However, SEPs are most commonly elicited by bipolar trancutaneous electrical stimulation applied on the skin over the trajectory of peripheral nerves of the upper limb (e.g., the median nerve) or lower limb (e.g., the posterior tibial nerve), and then recorded from the scalp. In general, somatosensory stimuli evoke early cortical components (N25, P60, N80), generated in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1), related to the processing of the physical stimulus attributes. About 100 ms after stimulus application, additional cortical regions are activated, such as the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), and the posterior parietal and frontal cortices, marked by a parietal P100 and bilateral frontal N140. SEPs are routinely used in neurology today to confirm and localize sensory abnormalities, to identify silent lesions and to monitor changes during surgical procedures.|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{has been}} little enthusiasm for <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> {{monitoring}} in cervical spine sur-gery as a result, in part, of the increased risk of motor tract injury at this level, to which somatosensory monitoring may be insensitive. Transcranial electric motor evoked potential monitoring allows assessment of the motor tracts; therefore, we compared transcranial electric motor evoked potential and <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> monitoring during cervical spine surgery to determine the temporal relationship between {{the changes in the}} potentials demon-strated by each type of monitoring and neurological sequelae and to identify patient-related and surgical factors asso-ciated with intraoperative neurophysiological changes. Methods: <b>Somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> and transcranial electric motor evoked potential data recorded for 427 patients undergoing anterior or posterior cervical spine surgery between January 1999 and March 2001 were ana-lyzed. All patients who showed substantial (at least 60 %) or complete unilateral or bilateral amplitude loss, for at least ten minutes, during the transcranial electric motor evoked potential and/or <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> monitoring were identified. Results: Twelve of the 427 patients demonstrated substantial or complete loss of amplitude of the transcranial elec-tric motor evoked potentials.

40|$|SUMMARY <b>Somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> were {{reviewed}} for their correlation with CT scan and clinical features of ischemic "pure sensory stroke " and "pure sensorimotor stroke". <b>Somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> were normal in all 11 cases of pure sensory stroke, and CT was normal in ten. The N 2 -P 2 {{components of the}} <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> were abnormal in all 4 cases of pure sensorimotor stroke, and all had low density CT lesions in the lateral thalamus and/or posterior limb of the internal capsule.

AimThe present {{study was conducted to}} determine the patterns of pelvic floor electrophysiology that are associated with faecal incontinence. SubjectsThe present study included 40 patients with faecal incontinence and 20 apparently healthy subjects as a control group. MethodsAll patients were subjected to history taking, clinical examination, proctosigmoidoscopy, anal manometry and electrophysiological studies. Electrophysiological studies included pudendal nerve motor conduction study, pudendo-anal reflex, needle electromyography of the external anal sphincter and puborectalis muscles, pudendal <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> and tibial <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential.</b> The control group was subjected to electrophysiological studies which include pudendal nerve motor conduction study, pudendo anal reflex, pudendal <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> and tibial <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential.</b> ResultsThe most common pelvic floor electrodiagnostic pattern characteristic of faecal incontinence was pudendal neuropathy, abnormal pudendo-anal reflex, denervation of the external anal sphincter and puborectalis at rest, incomplete interference pattern of the external anal sphincter and puborectalis at squeezing and cough and a localized defect in the external anal sphincter.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Victims of air {{embolism}} often recover rapidly on hyperbaric treatment then deteriorate again, even if hyperbaric treatment is continued. In previous animal experiments, lidocaine {{has been shown}} to improve recovery of somatosensory evoked response amplitude after {{air embolism}}. However, animals in these experiments rarely deteriorated. We have shown that the induction of air embolism and transient hypertension in canines produces deterioration despite hyperbaric treatment, and we decided to test the effect of lidocaine on <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> recovery and cerebral blood flow in this model. Methods: Dogs were treated with repeated doses of lidocaine or equivalent volumes of saline during hyperbaric therapy after internal carotid air embolism and transient hypertension. The investigators were unaware of treatment group assignment during the experiments. The amplitude of the median nerve <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> and cerebral blood flow measured with carbon- 14 -labeled iodoantipyrine autoradiography were used to assess effect of therapy. Results: Lidocaine-treated dogs recovered 60 ± 10 % (mean± 95 % confidence limits) of the baseline <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> amplitude 220 minutes after air embolism; saline-treated dogs recovered 32 ± 10 % (a significant difference atp< 0. 01).

40|$|Objective: No {{specific}} and sensitive method {{is available in}} routine clinical practice to detect pain in anaesthetised patients during surgery. The main aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether intraoperative <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials,</b> the bispectral index, electroencephalogram, blood pressure and heart rate change during painful stimulation in cardiac surgery patients. Methods: After induction of anaesthesia, 37 cardiac surgery patients were subjected to increasing electrical stimulation of both the median nerves and subsequent intravenous infusion of remifentanil to suppress this painful stimulation. Results: The higher intensities of electrical stimulation significantly modified the cortical <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials,</b> the electroencephalogram spectral edge frequency and blood pressure. We also observed the appearance of a middle-latency component in the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> cortical <b>potentials</b> between 60 and 70 ms.

Conclusions: The data suggest that <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> might be used to detect and monitor painful stimulation during surgery, unlike the bispectral index, which does not seem to be highly sensitive to intraoperative pain.

In addition electroencephalograms were carried out on 20 of the workers; the results were compared with those obtained for workers not exposed to lead. The workers exposed to lead had a mean blood lead concentration of 2. 35 mumol/l (48. 7 micrograms/ 100 ml), whereas the concentration for workers not exposed to lead was 0. 76 mumol/l (15. 8 micrograms/ 100 ml). The mean maximum motor conduction velocities of the median and the posterior tibial nerves were significantly lower in the workers exposed to lead than in the controls. Similarly, the distal latency for these two nerves was significantly prolonged for the workers exposed to lead. No significant differences for the two groups of workers were seen in the nerve conduction and distal latency measurements of the median (sensory) and the sural nerves. The EEG studies of the 20 workers exposed to lead showed no abnormalities. The <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> of the median (sensory) and posterior tibial nerves were significantly prolonged when measured at the negative and positive deflections. The results suggest that, in addition to nerve conduction velocities, <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> and distal latency are suitable measurements to detect subclinical neurological damage among workers exposed to lead. As these changes were seen at blood lead concentrations of 2. 35 mumol/l (48. 7 micrograms/ 100 ml) there may be a need for more stringent monitoring of workers exposed to lead...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Steady-state <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> (SSSEP) is a {{recently}} developing brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm where the brain response to tactile stimulation {{of a specific}} frequency is used. Generally, SSSEP-based BCI classifies whether the subjects focus on the tactile stimulation at the fingers in {{the left or right}} hand. In this paper, we examine the spatial pattern difference in SSSEP from each kind of focuses. The experimental results showed that when the subjects focus to the stimulation at one hand, SSSEP response in the contralateral side decreases. These results could be related to the neurological background, that the sensory cortices for each hand is located in the contra lateral sides of the hands. We also investigate the spatial patterns obtained from common spatial pattern (CSP). In the survey results, the spatial filters, whose corresponding spatial pattern vectors emphasize the left and right parietal lobes, where the somatosensory cortices for each hand are located, made clearly separable clusters of the feature values for each class.
