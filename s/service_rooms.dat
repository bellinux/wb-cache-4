5|$|A stone {{building}} {{to the east of}} the main complex is thought to have been the abbot's house. It contains two levels of vaulted apartments consisting of two halls, bedchambers, a private chapel and <b>service</b> <b>rooms.</b> The upper level was reached by an external staircase, which allowed this floor to be used independently if needed.|$|E
5|$|National Register of Historic Places {{nomination}} {{states that}} {{the interior of the}} building originally opened into a large meeting hall with some auxiliary <b>service</b> <b>rooms</b> {{at the rear of the}} building, but did not disclose any alterations made to the interior.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} entrance hall, {{reception and}} family bedrooms {{were placed on}} the first floor above a low semi-basement containing <b>service</b> <b>rooms.</b> The two principal entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases, originally a single broad flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south. These staircases have since been replaced by simpler designs.|$|E

5|$|Council House is {{constructed}} from concrete-encased steel frame, with lifts and <b>service</b> <b>rooms</b> located at its eastern end and a fire escape stairwell at its western end. Level 9 houses the distinctive circular Council Chamber, which features wood panelling {{and has been}} restored to largely its original state in the 1990s refurbishment (by contrast {{to most of the}} other levels of the building). The building is almost completely clad with glass, which led to criticism about its excessive air conditioning costs. The glass exterior of the building has T-shaped white sunbreakers superimposed in an alternating pattern across the building, coated with fine mosaic tiles. With the newly enclosed top floor, the building now has 13 levels above ground.|$|E
5|$|Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine (1635–1708) oversaw a {{substantial}} remodelling {{of the house}} in 1684, and much of the existing south facade dates from that time. The end bays were heightened, and the central porch was rebuilt with stone quoins and pilasters, a balustraded top and a small tower and cupola. A plan from 1684 shows the hall in the house's centre, with <b>service</b> <b>rooms</b> to the west and the main parlour to the east. On the first floor, the dining room was over the hall, the main bedchamber over the kitchen, and a lady's chamber over the porch.|$|E
5|$|The {{restored}} east range measures around 31m by 10m, with a {{pitched roof}} and crow-step gables. It is entered through a richly carved doorway, dated 1622 and initialled SWS for Sir William Sinclair, which gives {{access to the}} third floor. The three lower floors are cut into the rock, and each has four vaulted rooms, with a fifth in the south-east tower. These lower levels were used for <b>service</b> <b>rooms,</b> with the principal rooms in the two upper floors. At the lowest level was a kitchen, with a bakehouse above. On the exterior, gunloops are found on the south wall, with several shot-holes on the east.|$|E

5|$|The {{central and}} largest {{room in the}} house is the great hall which was the {{original}} dining room and the accompanying screens passage which gave access to the hall from the <b>service</b> <b>rooms.</b> The staircase {{to the north of the}} hall was added in the 18th century. The state room on the western side of the first floor was damaged by fire in 1882; the oak panelling around the fireplace was brought from the Eltons' former house in Queen Square, Bristol. The chapel on the first floor has a rectangular window with reticulated tracery, which dominates the front of the house. The stained glass in the window was added after the 1882 fire. The justice room has had a variety of uses but takes its name from its function as the manorial court until the 18th century. The house contains many family portraits and other pictures as well as collections of Eltonware and Nailsea Glass and prints of bridges and railways.|$|E
5|$|The range {{along the}} western curtain wall dates from about 1480, when the fourth earl remodelled the bailey. The great hall was the social hub of the castle, where the {{household}} gathered to eat. The now-ruined 15th-century building replaced an earlier hall on the same site, dating from about 1200, {{although some of the}} stone dates from the mid 12thcentury. The earl would have entered from the south from his connecting private chambers, and people of lower status through the Lion Tower. Internally, it was split into two aisles of differing width. Both halls were heated by open hearths, two of which survive from the earlier hall. Opposite ends of the hall were for opposite ends of the social scale within the castle. The high end (next to the withdrawing chamber) was for the earl and his family, and the low end (next to the kitchen and other <b>service</b> <b>rooms)</b> {{for the rest of the}} household. In the medieval period, the great hall was richly decorated with tapestries.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} façade is {{the great}} south front, a two-storey colonnade of Corinthian columns superimposed on Tuscan, the whole surmounted by a central pediment. The columns are not stone, but wood coated in stucco. It is possible this facade was inspired by work done in Paris on the church of S. Sulpice by Giovanni Niccolo Servandoni who was working in England from 1747–51; some drawings made for Sir Francis Dashwood in emulation of his uncle's patronage of Palladian style, survive by him in the collection at West Wycombe. The executant architect for this elevation and {{for much of the}} work on the house appears to have been the minor architectural view painter John Donowell, who worked between 1761 and 1763 (although he had to wait until 1775 for payment). The façade, which has similarities to the main façade of Palladio's Palazzo Chiericati of 1550, was originally the entrance front. The front door is still in the centre of the ground floor leading into the main entry hall. This is a substantial deviation from the classical form of English Palladianism in which the main entrance and principal rooms would be on the first floor reached by an outer staircase, giving the main reception rooms elevated views, with the ground floor given over to <b>service</b> <b>rooms.</b> Such a radical re-arrangement was not possible here since the house was a partial rebuild rather than a wholly new structure.|$|E
40|$|<b>Room</b> <b>service</b> is a {{valuable}} asset for hospitals in improving patient satisfaction and improving patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes for patients can be improved, the health of patients restored and their recovery quickened. At the very least, <b>room</b> <b>service</b> gives patients control over one aspect oftheir hospitalization which improves the quality oftheir stay and their opinion of {{the overall quality of}} care received. <b>Room</b> <b>Service</b> provides a level ofcontrol to patients for a portion oftheir care that cannot be readily achieved through any other <b>service.</b> <b>Room</b> <b>service</b> plays a part in creating a placebo affect in patients.

On one side of the corridor are rooms including a drawing room and a small dining room. On the other side are <b>service</b> <b>rooms,</b> and behind these is a courtyard. The contents of the wing include panelling removed from Canon Winder Hall, Flookburgh, a chimneypiece from Conishead Priory, and a pair of Baroque barley-sugar columns.|$|E
25|$|The school {{building}} was financed by Ripley {{and run by}} the non-denominational British and Foreign School Society It was designed by Andrews Son and Pepper in a gothic revivalist style. The halls and classrooms were on a single level with <b>service</b> <b>rooms</b> in a basement. Internally the ground floor (total area 4,192 sq. ft.) was mainly taken up by two large halls of double height. The south hall of 1600 sq. ft. accommodated the girls primary school and the northern hall of 1300 sq. ft. accommodated the boys. Two smaller classrooms accommodated the infants. Later photographic {{evidence suggests that the}} class room block as built varied from the plan. Instead of two unequally sized classrooms with an entrance lobby to the north there were two equally sized rooms separated by a centrally placed entrance lobby. The entrance door was beneath a gabled semi-dormer with a round window in the gable – very similar to the gables of the north façade.|$|E

25|$|The Conqueror’s Pavilion, {{also called}} the Conqueror's Kiosk (Fatih Köşkü) {{is one of the}} oldest {{buildings}} inside the palace. It was built c. 1460, when the palace was first constructed. It consists of two floors raised on a terrace above the garden, built at the top of the promontory on a cliff with a magnificent view from its porch of the Sea of Marmara and the Bosporus. The lower floor consisted of <b>service</b> <b>rooms,</b> while the upper floor was a suite of four apartments and a large loggia with double arches. All the rooms open onto the Third Courtyard through a monumental arcade. The colonnaded portico on the side of the garden is connected to each of the four halls by a large door. The pavilion was used as the treasury for the revenues from Egypt under Sultan Selim I. During excavations in the basement, a small Byzantine baptistery built along a trefoil plan was found. It houses the Imperial Treasury (Hazine-i Âmire).|$|E
25|$|The home's {{interior}} features 16th, 17th, and 18th century French and English details. The {{building is}} heated by an oil-burning, hot air furnace and contains an Otis passenger elevator and freight elevator. The passenger elevator is wood-paneled and the freight elevator measures 5x4feet (1.5x1.2m) in diameter. The flooring consists {{of black and}} white marble squares and the walls are plastered to simulate limestone. In {{the back of the house}} is a five-bay entrance hall and staircase. The library entrance is located on the right side of the hallway and two reception rooms and a lavatory are located on the left side. Near the end of the hall are <b>service</b> <b>rooms,</b> service elevator, dining room (now the ambassador's office), and a breakfast room. A lavatory is located beneath the main staircase. At the end of the hall are two parlors and a large drawing room. The second floor contains three bedrooms, two baths, and a service area. One of the bedrooms, the master suite, contains a separate staircase that gives access to the upper floors. The third floor contains bedroom suites and a playroom in the southeast corner. The fourth floor contains additional bedrooms and servants' quarters.|$|E
500|$|Clifton Hall was {{originally}} built around 1400 {{in the village}} of Clifton, south of Penrith, Cumbria, by either Elianor Engaine or her son-in-law William Wybergh. The Engaines had held the manor of Clifton since at least the 12th century, providing military service to the regional feudal lords in exchange for the land, and may have built an earlier manor house on a different site, possibly close to the village church of St Cuthbert. Clifton Hall was initially constructed around an [...] "H"-plan, with a central hall bracketed by two cross-wings, one wing containing the family's living accommodation, the other the kitchen and the other <b>service</b> <b>rooms.</b> This style was popular at this time across Cumbria, and indeed England more generally.|$|E

500|$|Nikolaus Pevsner {{describes}} Barry's reconstruction as [...] "an extremely sumptuous job." [...] Peter de Figueiredo and Julian Treuherz {{consider it}} his finest work, attributing his success to being [...] "directed {{by the powerful}} character of the existing building." [...] Barry's work is considered to be, in general, more elaborate and more regular than the original. For {{the restoration of the}} interior, he employed several of the leading artists and craftsmen of the time, who had previously worked on the Palace of Westminster. Barry's principal innovation was the addition of a tower to the west wing, which was required for water storage. Intended to unite the east and west wings of the hall, the effect is limited by the tower's Victorian design. He also reorganised the plan of the building, opening up Blore's central hall to create a two-storey atrium, as well as providing more ground-floor <b>service</b> <b>rooms</b> and generating twenty extra servants' bedrooms in an attic by modifying the roof.|$|E

40|$|<b>Room</b> <b>service</b> {{represents}} {{a revolution in}} hospital patient dining. More menu options, more flexibility in meal delivery, increased food quality, and more personalized service resulted in improved nutritional intake among patients receiving <b>room</b> <b>service.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify key aspects hospital foodservice directors (HFDs) considered when deciding to implement <b>room</b> <b>service</b> and determined the importance of each aspect. A mixed methods study was conducted to address the objectives of this study. Responses from a key informant interview and HFDs on open-ended questions were utilized to develop a web questionnaire. A web questionnaire was e-mailed to 845 HFDs for both groups (who had and had not implemented <b>room</b> <b>service)</b> and HFDs were asked to rate the importance of 28 aspects of <b>room</b> <b>service</b> implementation. Of the 28 aspects, 14 were rated important, very important or extremely important. Factor analysis on 28 aspects revealed four <b>room</b> <b>service</b> factors: cost allocation, human resources and facilities, food quality, and patient satisfaction. Food quality and patient satisfaction factors were perceived as more important by HFDs who had implemented <b>room</b> <b>service</b> than who had not. Cost allocation was the most important factor reported by HFDs who had not implemented <b>room</b> <b>service.</b> Perception on the importance of the patient satisfaction factor differed between hospital type as well as hospital size. Possessing experience and knowledge regarding the nature of <b>room</b> <b>service,</b> HFDs who had implemented <b>room</b> <b>service</b> perceived the customer-oriented meal delivery concept, the availability of menu selections based on patients 2 ̆ 7 preferences, and great food quality served as more important to the success of <b>room</b> <b>service</b> implementation. The cost factor was not as important to those HFDs who had implemented <b>room</b> <b>service</b> as compared to who had not. This may be explained, partially, by the fact that HFDs have already experienced implementation and seen cost savings such as reduction of food waste along with improved patient satisfaction ratings...|$|R
