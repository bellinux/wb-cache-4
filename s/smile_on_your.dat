And also like his charisma, his character, he can always put a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> face.

500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Rolling Stone {{review of the}} album, critic Rob Sheffield wrote: [...] "'God Put a Smile Upon Your Face' is the slinkiest and best thing Coldplay have ever done." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "Buckland's lead fills highlight the wondrous 'God Put a <b>Smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> Face', as the song's chorus reaches heights that rival those of their fellow countrymen Doves." [...] Ted Kessler of NME wrote: [...] "Over a pounding garage tattoo Martin poses a deep, mortality-based teaser ('where {{do we go from}} here?'), asserts some self-belief ('God gave me style, God gave me grace') and then hits upon the bottom line as the song's mood suddenly improves with another fat and glorious chorus: 'Yeah, when you work it out I'm the same as you....your guess is as good as mine.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Eckhart's {{next project}} was Thank You for Smoking, {{in which he}} played Nick Naylor, a tobacco {{lobbyist}} whose firm researched the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer. Eckhart said that he felt challenged playing the role: [...] "You have to say these words that are crazy, and yet {{do it with a}} <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> face and have the audience like you. At one point, I'm doing a talk show with a kid who's dying of cancer, and he's going through chemotherapy and the whole thing, and I spin it so the anti-smoking people are the bad guys and I'm the good guy, and I'm this guy's best friend. I mean, it's whacked out." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 30th annual Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. It had a limited release in March 2006 and was released worldwide the following month. For his performance, Eckhart received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. A contributor of USA Today wrote that he gave a [...] "standout, whip-smart performance" [...] citing that as Nick Naylor he kept him [...] "likable even in his cynicism." [...] In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer review of the film, it was reported that [...] "Under his chummy but compassionless smile" [...] Eckhart radiated charm and [...] "Naylor's true joys: manipulating arguments, steering debate, cooking words." ...|$|E

This, this is the blessed truth of which the parish church is token, as nought else can be--that you are one body, members one of another, and that God's blessing is <b>on</b> <b>your</b> union and fellow-feeling; that God <b>smiles</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> bearing each other's burdens, and so fulfilling the law of Christ.

To the stodgy, suety world of course it's little else than sheer moonshine, midsummer madness. Naturally, in its own charming and stodgy way the world kept flickering cold water in his direction.

2500|$|Nintendo World Report's Jared Rosenberg {{scored the}} Wii version 8.5 out of 10, praising {{its use of}} the Wii's controls, but criticizing the graphics, writing [...] "It {{is obvious that the}} game is over 10 years old. Character and enemy models are noticeably low polygon, and the textures seem muddy and N64-like at times." [...] However, he {{concluded}} [...] "MDK2 is a well-designed action platformer that will take quite a bit of time to get through its 10 levels. Varied play mechanics keep the shooter fresh and the humorous story should occasionally put a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> face.

Still, MDK2: Armageddon is a solid shooter with plenty of ingenuity and slick presentation." [...] Nintendo World Report's Jared Rosenberg called the Wii version [...] "a well-designed action platformer that will take {{quite a bit of}} time to get through.

I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North {{at the time of the}} Civil War, for I remember you expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people. You felt so strongly about it that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that also. When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the picture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil War, and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your hands clinched, I was positive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder; you shook your head. You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life. Your hand stole towards your own old wound, and a <b>smile</b> quivered <b>on</b> <b>your</b> lips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind.

During a 2011 interview with Spin magazine, Lee described [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] as [...] "mostly a chick anthem: 'You only want me when you're drunk.
