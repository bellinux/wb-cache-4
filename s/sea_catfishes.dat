500|$|The sharptooth houndshark is {{a highly}} active species, though it can {{sometimes}} be found resting inside rocky crevices. It mainly hunts at night and {{has been known to}} pursue prey almost onto the shore. The pointed cusps of its teeth allow it to grasp slippery prey, while their broad bases allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. This shark feeds on a variety of crustaceans (crabs, slipper lobsters, and spiny lobsters), bony fishes (including morwongs, <b>sea</b> <b>catfishes,</b> drums, and porgies), and cephalopods (in particular Octopus vulgaris). Sharks and rays (including catsharks and guitarfishes) and their egg capsules are a minor food source for larger individuals. Off South Africa, the most important prey species is the crab Plagusia chabrus. Its dietary composition changes with age: young sharks under [...] long subsist almost completely on crabs, while larger sharks consume more bony fishes and cephalopods, as well as a greater variety of prey overall. This shark has been observed deviating from its nocturnal habits to feed on chokka squid (Loligo reynaudii) during their mass spawnings. The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is known to prey on this species.|$|E
500|$|Of the oviparous teleosts, most (79 percent) do {{not provide}} parental care. Male care is far more common than female care. Male {{territoriality}} [...] "preadapts" [...] a species to evolve male parental care. One unusual example of female parental care is in mother discuses, which provide nutrients for their developing young {{in the form of}} mucus. Some teleost species have their eggs or young attached to or carried in their bodies. For <b>sea</b> <b>catfishes,</b> cardinalfishes, jawfishes and some others, the egg may be incubated or carried in the mouth, a practice known as mouthbrooding. In some African cichlids, the eggs may be fertilised there. In species like the banded acara, young are brooded after they hatch and this may be done by both parents. The timing of the release of young varies between species; some mouthbrooders release new-hatched young while other may keep then until they are juveniles. In addition to mouthbrooding, some teleost have also developed structures to carry young. Male nurseryfish have a bony hook on their foreheads to carry fertilised eggs; they remain on the hook until they hatch. For seahorses, the male has a brooding pouch where the female deposits the fertilised eggs and they remain there until they become free-swimming juveniles. Female banjo catfishes have structures on their belly to which the eggs attach.|$|E
