5|$|A {{central part}} of Macdonald's case {{concerned}} the redistribution of wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument {{was based on the}} premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, so that they could pay for government <b>services</b> <b>available</b> in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.|$|E

5|$|English and French are {{recognized}} by the Constitution of Canada as official languages. All federal government laws are thus enacted in both English and French, with government <b>services</b> <b>available</b> in both languages. Two of Canada's territories give official status to indigenous languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government. In the Northwest Territories, the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwich'in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and Tłįchǫ. Multicultural media are widely accessible {{across the country and}} offer specialty television channels, newspapers and other publications in many minority languages.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Macdonald {{plunged into}} {{his role as}} a leading {{champion}} for the provinces. He argued that in order to maintain their independence, provinces needed exclusive jurisdiction over such sources of revenue as gasoline, electricity and amusement taxes. He lobbied for constitutional amendments designed to guarantee provincial rights. Macdonald urged the federal government to accept the 1940 recommendations of the Rowell-Sirois Commission and redistribute national wealth based on need. Such a policy, he maintained, would enable poorer provinces to sustain government <b>services</b> <b>available</b> {{in other parts of the}} country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation. In the end, Macdonald won only small victories such as gaining exclusive provincial access to gasoline taxes. The federal government refused to recognize financial need as the basis for provincial subsidies.|$|E
