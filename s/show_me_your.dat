500|$|By this time, while {{dismissing the}} {{possibility}} of a Pixies reunion, Thompson had begun to incorporate an increasing number of the band's songs into Catholics concerts, as well as including Santiago in his solo work again. Black and the Catholics continued to release records; two separate albums, Black Letter Days and Devil's Workshop, were released simultaneously in 2002. Devil's Workshop included the song [...] "Velvety" [...] (...) , a version of the Pixies song [...] "Velvety Instrumental Version" [...] (written by Black as a teenager) with lyrics. The song {{was one of the first}} signs that he had acknowledged his past work with the Pixies in his solo output. A sixth album with the Catholics, <b>Show</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Tears, was released in 2003. <b>Show</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Tears title and many of the songs in it were inspired by Thompson's recent divorce and entry into therapy.|$|E

2500|$|December 2000 saw {{the release}} of S.E.S.'s fourth album, A Letter From Greenland. This again was {{accompanied}} by a change in image. This album saw them move away from the cute image entirely, having instead a [...] "mature" [...] concept. All the members wore suits for their performances, and their look was significantly more sophisticated. The style of their songs also moved away from light pop music: instead of having cute pop songs (like their first two albums), or R songs (like their third album), this album was very jazzy. [...] "감싸 안으며 (<b>Show</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Love)" [...] was the first single from the album. A cover of j-pop star Misia's [...] "Tsutsumi Komu Youni...", the song was a slow, jazzy ballad that showed off the vocal abilities of all three singers. This single and album continued S.E.S.'s winning streak, helping to cement their status as K-pop's top group at the time. The second single, [...] "Be Natural", also did fairly well, even though under-promoted in comparison to the first.|$|E
