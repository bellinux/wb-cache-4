40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} dynamic {{behaviour}} of policies for resolving trade deficits. We extend the Thirlwall-based model by introducing an equation for <b>setting</b> <b>current</b> account policy. Steady-state solutions implying current account equilibrium emerge under autonomous spending contraction, exchange rate develuation, export expansion, and import reduction. Stability holds with plausible restrictions. simulations {{based upon the}} United States reveal that autonomous spending, import, and export policies behave similarly in correcting trade deficits. Exchange rate devaluation generates considerably slower adjustment. Corresponding output growth paths are also examined. The study formally incorporates dynamics into the Thirlwall approach for analysing balance of paymnets constrained growth. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{oscillator}} circuit for sensing and indicating temperature {{by changing}} oscillator frequency with temperature comprises a programmable operational amplifier which is operated on the roll-off {{portion of its}} gain versus frequency curve and has its output directly connected to the inverting input to place the amplifier in a follower configuration.

It will examine potential synergies between a curriculum for educational youth work and contemporary curricula in school education, drawing on the emerging Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) (Scottish Government, 2013) as a potentially useful means of facilitating social change. The chapter will explore some of the ‘hidden knowns’ that youth workers routinely apply in practice encounters including school settings. This exploration suggests that while these ‘knowns’ contribute to practice, they can also limit perspectives on whether youth work can be authentically conceptualised in a school <b>setting.</b> <b>Current</b> changes in policy direction of policy for formal schooling across the UK brings into focus different ideas such as free or home schooling and identifies new roles and possibilities for youth workers in schools...|$|E
30|$|In fact, {{there is}} no {{inherent}} difference between child care and early education. Either can be a rich experience that contributes to children’s development or not, depending on {{what goes on in}} the <b>setting.</b> <b>Current</b> policies in the U.S., however, often perpetuate the two streams in ways that act to the detriment of experiences for many young children. Some other countries are organizing systems to integrate programs for preschool children (infancy to school entry). For example, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Sweden each operate all early childhood programs under a single education ministry or department (Melhuish & Petrogiannis, 2006). Some states and localities in the U.S. have also begun to move in this direction (for example, by providing similar training to Head Start, child care centers, and Pre-Kindergarten programs), but the chasm continues to be wide.|$|E
40|$|Invasive fungal {{diseases}} (IFD) due to opportunistic fungi {{are commonly}} treated using empirical antifungal therapy. Therefore, a {{comprehensive study of}} organisms associated with IFD is essential to define successful empiric therapies in each <b>setting.</b> <b>Current</b> diagnostic tests, such as culture, histology and serology are suboptimal, leading to delays in the initiation of antifungal therapies and resulting in high mortality rates despite the availability of several new antifungal agents. Using molecular methods to identify fungal pathogens directly from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues is emerging as a diagnostic approach. The goal of this molecular approach is to complement conventional diagnostic tests through the reliable detection and identification of fungal nucleic acids or antigens in tissues so as to direct antiinfective therapies and improve patient outcomes.
