5|$|Thanks to {{the thick}} {{straight}} wing the Thunderjet rapidly reached its Mach 0.82 limitation at full throttle and low altitude. The aircraft had sufficient power to fly faster, but exceeding the Mach limit at low altitudes {{resulted in a}} violent pitch-up and structural failure causing the wings to break off. Above 15,000ft (4,600m), the F-84 could be flown faster but {{at the expense of}} severe buffeting. Fortunately, the airspeed was sufficiently easy to control to make safe dive bombing from 10,000ft (3,000m) possible. The top <b>speed</b> <b>limitation</b> proved troublesome against Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s in Korea. Slower than the MiG, the F-84 was also unable to turn tightly with a maximum instantaneous-turn load of only 3Gs followed by rapid loss of airspeed. One F-84E pilot credited with two MiG kills achieved his second victory by intentionally flying his aircraft into pitch-up. The MiGs chasing him were unable to follow the violent maneuver and one crashed into the ground. Luckily for the F-84E pilot, the aircraft did not disintegrate but the airframe did suffer heavy warping. The F-84 was a stable gun platform and the computing gunsight aided in accurate gunnery and bombing. Pilots praised the aircraft for Republic's legendary ruggedness.|$|E

500|$|The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) {{tested a}} C3 Picasso Confort [...] model with {{standard}} equipment, including: a single forward airbag for each front seat, a <b>speed</b> <b>limitation</b> device, but no ESC. The vehicle was scored {{on the basis}} of: child and adult injury, including whiplash risk from the seating, a pedestrian front impact rating, safety equipment and clear labels detailing how to disable some features. The results of the front end tests were mixed, with the bumper scoring all available points, but the vehicle was penalised {{for the lack of}} protection and the potential damage caused if a pedestrian is struck by the bonnet. Protection inside the car was scored highly for almost every seat, and for adult and child protection; it lost points for its use of forward-facing restraints, which can be fatal in an accident if an infant is hit by an airbag. The C3 Picasso was also penalised for offering very poor whiplash protection in the driver's seatscoring nothing in two of the three tests and then losing points for the position of the unadjusted restraint. Overall, the vehicle scored four of five stars, less than most vehicles the Euro NCAP compares it with, which were released around the same time.|$|E
2500|$|The first really {{popular and}} commercially {{successful}} design was French. An example {{is at the}} Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa. Initially developed around 1863, it sparked a fashionable craze briefly during 1868-70. Its design was simpler than the Macmillan bicycle; it used rotary cranks and pedals mounted to the front wheel hub. Pedaling {{made it easier for}} riders to propel the machine at speed, but the rotational <b>speed</b> <b>limitation</b> of this design created stability and comfort concerns which would lead to the large front wheel of the [...] "penny farthing". It was difficult to pedal the wheel that was used for steering. The use of metal frames reduced the weight and provided sleeker, more elegant designs, and also allowed mass-production. [...] Different braking mechanisms were used depending on the manufacturer. In England, the velocipede earned the name of [...] "bone-shaker" [...] because of its rigid frame and iron-banded wheels that resulted in a [...] "bone-shaking experience for riders." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stepper motors can {{be rotated}} to a {{specific}} angle in discrete steps with ease, and hence stepper motors are used for read/write head positioning in computer floppy diskette drives. They {{were used for the}} same purpose in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives, where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the read/write head of a hard disk drive. As drive density increased, the precision and speed limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drives—the precision limitation made them unusable, and the <b>speed</b> <b>limitation</b> made them uncompetitive—thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems. (The term [...] "voice coil" [...] in this connection is historic; it refers to the structure in a typical (cone type) loudspeaker. This structure was used for a while to position the heads. Modern drives have a pivoted coil mount; the coil swings back and forth, something like a blade of a rotating fan. Nevertheless, like a voice coil, modern actuator coil conductors (the magnet wire) move perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force.) ...|$|E
