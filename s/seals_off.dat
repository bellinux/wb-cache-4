5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour <b>seals</b> <b>off</b> the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the very}} high power levels involved, large lamps are water-cooled. In those used in IMAX projectors, the {{electrode}} bodies are made from solid Invar and tipped with thoriated tungsten. An O-ring <b>seals</b> <b>off</b> the tube, so that the naked electrodes do not contact the water. In low power applications the electrodes are too cold for efficient electron emission and are not cooled; in high power applications an additional water cooling circuit for each electrode is necessary. To save costs, the water circuits are often not separated and the water needs to be deionized to make it electrically non-conductive, which, in turn, lets the quartz or some laser media dissolve into the water.|$|E

2500|$|Continuing where [...] "The Poison Sky" [...] left off, the TARDIS {{takes the}} Doctor, Martha, and Donna {{to the planet}} Messaline. As they emerge from the TARDIS, they are met by {{soldiers}} working for General Cobb. The soldiers force the Doctor to stick his hand into a progenation machine, which uses his DNA to generate a female soldier who becomes the Doctor's daughter. They are soon confronted by the other occupants of the planet, the Hath. The Hath attack, taking Martha hostage. The Doctor's daughter causes an explosion that <b>seals</b> <b>off</b> the corridor they are in, trapping Martha on the other side. The Doctor and Donna are taken to see General Cobb in the command center, {{and along the way}} Donna names the Doctor's daughter [...] "Jenny" [...] because the Doctor calls her a generated anomaly.|$|E
2500|$|The film however, was {{not without}} its detractors. Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert bluntly noted that the motion picture [...] "does not have {{conventional}} rewards or payoffs, does not simplify a complex situation, doesn't punch up the action or the romance simply to entertain. But it is, sad to say, not a very entertaining movie; it's a long slog unless you're fascinated by the undercurrents." [...] In a primarily negative review, Lisa Schwarzbaum writing for Entertainment Weekly, called the film [...] "an oddly unengaging one, {{not because of any}} weak performances (even crooning poetess Jewel acquits herself pleasantly in her film debut), but because the waxy yellow buildup of earnest tastefulness (the curse of the Burns school of history) <b>seals</b> <b>off</b> every character from our access." [...] Describing a favorable opinion, Russell Smith of The Austin Chronicle professed the film as exhibiting [...] "unostentatious originality, psychological insight, and stark beauty". While following up, he stressed [...] "There's an odd blend of stylization and extreme realism to this film. The dialogue is stilted, full of archaic $20-words and dime-novel flamboyance — all the more jarring when delivered by these teenaged bumpkin characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|A chimney damper is a {{metal plate}} {{that can be}} {{positioned}} to close off the chimney {{when not in use}} and prevent outside air from entering the interior space, and can be opened to permit hot gases to exhaust when a fire is burning. [...] A top damper or cap damper is a metal spring door placed {{at the top of the}} chimney with a long metal chain that allows one to open and close the damper from the fireplace. [...] A throat damper is a metal plate at the base of the chimney, just above the firebox, that can be opened and closed by a lever, gear, or chain to seal off the fireplace from the chimney. [...] The advantage of a top damper is the tight weatherproof seal that it provides when closed, which prevents cold outside air from flowing down the chimney and into the living space—a feature that can rarely be matched by the metal-on-metal seal afforded by a throat damper. [...] Additionally, because the throat damper is subjected to intense heat from the fire directly below, it is common for the metal to become warped over time, thus further degrading the ability of the throat damper to seal. [...] However, the advantage of a throat damper is that it <b>seals</b> <b>off</b> the living space from the air mass in the chimney, which, especially for chimneys positioned on an outside of wall of the home, is generally very cold. [...] It is possible in practice to use both a top damper and a throat damper to obtain the benefits of both. [...] The two top damper designs currently on the market are the Lyemance (pivoting door) and the Lock Top (translating door).|$|E

Some plan must be invented, and she wished to lock herself in where no one could interrupt her, as might easily happen in the garden.

Then she slipped back, shaking with fear and excitement, to where the young officer still lay asleep, thrust the letter into the fold so his turban, and hurried back to her room. It was done! ...|$|E
