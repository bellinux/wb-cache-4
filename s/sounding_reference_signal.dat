In particular, we show that the proposed algorithm can allow for the first speed estimation to be obtained after 10 seconds and with an average speed underestimation error of 14 kmph. After the first speed acquisition, subsequent speed estimations can be obtained much faster (e. g., each second) with limited implementation cost and still provide high accuracy...|$|E

In order to support spatial multiplexing, however, the DM-RS of each layer is designed to be orthogonal to one another, using cyclic shifts of a CAZAC (constant amplitude zero auto-correlation) sequence [24]. Moreover, an orthogonal cover code (OCC) is employed to provide additional orthogonality between layers. For the case of the SRS, the orthogonality between layers is realized by using cyclic shifts of the SRS sequence, different frequency combs or combination of the two.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by the {{increasing}} demand for higher data rates, coverage, and spectral efficiency, current and next generation wireless systems adapt transmission parameters and even who is being transmitted to, based on the instantaneous channel states. For example, frequency-domain scheduling(FDS) is an instance of adaptation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access(OFDMA) systems in which the base station opportunistically assigns different subcarriers to their most appropriate user. Likewise,transmit antenna selection(AS) is another form of adaptation in which the transmitter adapts which subset of antennas it transmits with. Cognitive radio(CR), which is a next generation technology, itself {{is a form of}} adaptation in which secondary users(SUs) adapt their transmissions to avoid interfering with the licensed primary users(PUs), who own the spectrum. However, adaptation requires channel state information(CSI), which might not be available apriori at the node or nodes that are adapting. Further, the CSI might not be perfect due to noise or feedback delays. This can result in suboptimal adaptation in OFDMA systems or excessive interference at the PUs due to transmissions by the SUs in CR. In this thesis, we focus on adaptation techniques in current and next generation wireless systems and evaluate the impact of CSI –both perfect and imperfect –on it. We first develop a novel model and analysis for characterizing the performance of AS in frequency-selective OFDMA systems. Our model is unique and comprehensive in that it incorporates key LTE features such as imperfect channel estimation based on dense, narrow band demodulation reference signal and coarse, broad band <b>sounding</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signal.</b> It incorporates the frequency-domain scheduler, the hardware constraint that the same antenna must be used to transmit over all the subcarriers that are allocated to a user, and the scheduling constraint that the allocated subcarriers must all be contiguous. Our results show the effectiveness of combined AS and FDS in frequency-selective OFDMA systems even at lower <b>sounding</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> powers. We then investigate power adaptation in underlay CR, in which the SU can transmit even when the primary is on but under stringent interference constraints. The nature of the interference constraint fundamentally decides how the SU adapts its transmit power. To this end, assuming perfect CSI, we propose optimal transmit power adaptation policies that minimize the symbol error probability of an SU when they are subject to different interference and transmit power constraints. We then study the robustness of these optimal policies to imperfections in CSI. An interesting observation that comes out of our study is that imperfect CSI can not only increase the interference at the PU but can also decrease it, and this depends on the choice of the system parameters, interference, and transmit power constraints. The regimes in which these occur are characterized...|$|E
40|$|Distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (DM-MIMO) gives {{a higher}} {{spectral}} efficiency and enhanced coverage area, compared to collocated massive MIMO (CMMIMO). In general, for massive MIMO, {{time division duplex}} is preferable as it enables downlink (DL) precoding based on uplink (UL) channel estimation. A time division duplex (TDD) reciprocity calibration is then essential to compensate {{the gap between the}} UL-DL channels, which can be done completely in the base station relying on <b>sounding</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signals</b> (SRSs). For a collocated array, relying on mutual coupling between antenna elements, each SRS is received with sufficient power in the array, enabling a reliable estimate of the calibration coefficients. Nevertheless, for DM-MIMO, much less power is collected in distant inter-cluster antennas which degrades the accuracy of the estimated calibration. In this paper, we propose a novel inter-cluster combining method (ICCM) which improves the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) of the SRS, and hence achieves a more robust calibration accuracy for practical DM-MIMO systems.

40|$|In 3 GPP {{long term}} {{evolution}} (LTE), sounding is used to gain a wideband estimate of the uplink channel. This channel estimate may then be used for several radio resource management related applications such as frequency selective scheduling and beam forming. Code division multiplexing (CDM) enables several users to broadcast <b>sounding</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signals</b> (SRS) simultaneously on {{the same time and}} frequency resource. As the multiplexed users may interfere with one another there is a trade-off between having users broadcast SRS as often as possible to get a frequent channel estimate and getting higher quality estimates with a lower periodicity. To assess this trade-off one must have a good understanding of what causes the errors in the channel estimate so that the sounding resource may be used as efficiently as possible. This thesis proposes a method to model the channel estimation error with sounding for use in a system simulator environment. The method consists of estimating a standard deviation with a per-resource-block resolution of the channel estimates as a function of received signal powers of interfering users as well as the target user and background noise. This estimated estimation error may then, in the system simulator, be applied to a known ideal channel estimate as noise. The main limiting source of error is shown to beinterference, both from sounding users in the same cell and in others as well as some effects of limited frequency resolution. Simulation results indicate that a cleverly designed sounding resource handler is needed to fully utilize the possible gains of sounding...|$|R

One way of handling the increased data traffic is to deploy large antenna arrays at the base station, also known as Massive MIMO. In Massive MIMO, the base station having excessive number of transmit antennas, can achieve increased data rate by spatial-multiplexing terminals into the same time-frequency resource. This thesis investigates Massive MIMO in LTE in a single-cell deployment with up to 100 base station antennas. The benefits of more antennas are investigated with single-antenna terminals in a typical urban environment. The terminal transmitted <b>sounding</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signals</b> (SRS) are used at the base station to calculate channel state information (CSI) in order to generate an MRT precoder. With perfect CSI, {{the results showed that}} the expected terminal SINR depends on the antenna-terminal ratio.

When having moving terminals at 3 km/h, the difference between the 10 th and 90 th SINR percentile is 1 dB with an SRS transmission periodicity of 20 ms, and 17 dB with an SRS transmission periodicity of 80 ms. With 100 base station antennas and moving terminals at 3 km/h with an SRS periodicity of 20 ms, the maximum cell throughput decreased with 13 % compared to when the base station has perfect CSI.

40|$|Transmit antenna {{selection}} (TAS) {{technology has}} been adopted for the uplink by the next generation Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless standard in order to harness the spatial diversity offered by multiple antennas at the mobile transmitter, while keeping the hardware complexity and cost of a mobile low. In TAS, the number of radio frequency (RF) chains for processing/up-conversion is smaller {{than the number of}} available antenna elements, so that at any time the signals can only be transmitted from a (dynamically optimized) subset of antenna elements. As a result, the training procedure for AS needs to be carefully engineered.
