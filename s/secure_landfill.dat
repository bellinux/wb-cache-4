40|$|Currently, the {{generated}} {{brake lining}} waste dust, which contains asbestos as its major component, is disposed of into a <b>secure</b> <b>landfill</b> without any additional treatment. As {{an alternative to}} this, solidification/stabilization (S/S) disposal of the dust was investigated using Portland cement alone acid Portland cement mixed with activated carbon (AC), as the binders. Toxicity Characteristics Leaching procedure (TCLP) results on the solidified matrix showed that cement was able to immobilize the heavy metals, Ba, Zn, Cr, Pb, Cu and Fe, to within the limits set by the US EPA for TCLP. Addition of AC to the cement reduced the leaching of heavy metals by an additional 4 - 24 % compared to cement alone. The pH of the TCLP leachate extracted from virgin cement, and from dust treated with cement with or without AC was found to increase to 10. 9 - 12. 5 {{as opposed to an}} initial value of 4. 93 for the TCLP extract for the untreated dust. Results of ANS 10. 1 (modified) leach protocol revealed that Ba in cement-treated samples showed the highest leach rate, followed by Zn, Pb, Cr, Cu and Fe. The leach rate of heavy metals decreased with progress in time. Cement mixed with AC exhibited similar leach characteristics, however, the leach rate was lower. The linear relationship between the cumulative fraction leached (CFL) and the square root of leaching time in all cement-based samples indicate that a diffusional process is the controlling transport mechanism for the leaching of the heavy metals. The obtained Leachability Indices (L-i) of 7. 6 - 9. 1 and 8. 3 - 9. 5 for cement and cement with AC, respectively, were low but exceeded the guidance value of 6, which clearly indicates that all the heavy metals studied are retained well within solid matrices. Cement-based S/S hardening times increased from 30 to 96 h as the dust content increased from 40 to 70 wt. %. The resulting solid matrices exhibited a compressive strength ranging from 1 to 12 MPa, which was well above the specified limit of 414 kPa for such matrices. An economic analysis indicates that the disposal costs for the dust in the only available <b>secure</b> <b>landfill</b> would increase by 40. 3 % if one were to go for the cement S/S option. Addition of AC to the cement would escalate this by an additional 43. 8 %. Although the S/S of brake lining dust using cement effectively immobilized the heavy metals of concern, cost considerations may hinder the commercial adaptation of this technique for waste disposal unless new regulatory demands are implemented.

40|$|Innovative {{means and}} methods were tested {{to develop an}} economical, pragmatic and {{environmentally}} sustainable soil remediation process for heavy metal contaminated soils. An unsaturated-flow soil washing procedure was devised to dissolve the soil-bound toxic heavy metals; the latter were extracted by a chemical washing solution that percolated through the soil matrix. Subsequently, the leached toxic heavy metals were selectively concentrated, by a chemical precipitation process, into a solid waste. Thereby, {{a fraction of the}} spent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), within the washing and rinsing leachate, was theoretically regenerated and recycle-ready. The unsaturated-flow washing procedure was perfected by applying different treatments to a soil from a <b>secure</b> <b>landfill.</b> This soil was contaminated with Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, S and Zn. The major contaminants were Fe, Pb, Zn, S, Cu and Mn, making up 25, 1. 9, 1. 0, 0. 4, 0. 4 and 0. 2 %wt of the soil. The extraction responses of the contaminants and those of Al, Ca, Mg and P were established for citric acid (0. 5 M) and different molarities of diammonium EDTA ((NH 4) 2 EDTA). The DOW Chemical Company supplied the (NH 4) 2 EDTA (i. e. VERSENE), a 1. 37 M industrial cleaner, which roughly costs $ 1. 85 kg- 1 in bulk. The affordability of VERSENE was a pre-condition for hoping to satisfy the economical feasibility of remediating trace metal contaminated soils. Ultimately, the developed unsaturated-flow washing procedure was tested in a pilot-scale experiment, for its ability to remediate a soil from an abandoned car battery recycling facility. The latter soil was severely contaminated with Pb (3. 9 %wt). Drip irrigation was used to apply (NH 4) 2 EDTA and water-rinsing solutions to the surface of soil heaps that rested atop an impermeable barrier, which permitted the retrieval of the leachate. A cumulative EDTA input to the soil of 10. 6 % wt extracted 49. 4 % of the total Pb content of the soil. Alternatively, readily biodegradable citric acid barely extracted 2. 2 % of the total Pb content of the soil, for a cumulative input of 18. 1 % weight of soil. Different treatments were tested for their effectiveness in concentrating the leached toxic heavy metals into a solid waste. The Pb was best precipitated with Na 2 S alone, as it provided the most concentrated solid toxic waste. The environmental sustainability of remediating trace metal contaminated soils was thoroughly examined, as per the amounts of chemical entrants and toxic waste by-products, and per the post-treatment leaching of toxic levels of the remaining and potentially toxic trace metals.

40|$|Nowadays, many {{companies}} are engaged in the heading of plasticizers molded in oil refineries, chemical industry, production of phenolic resins mainly generated byindustrial effluents with high concentrations of organic compounds, where they have great highlight the presence of phenolic substances. In the process of production of phenolic resins, exists as a product distilled {{in the presence of}} phenol at high concentrations (approximately 5 %), which is part of industrial wastewater effluent, with this part of the environmental problem that this paper proposes a industry a new technique for recovery, reuse and contribution to the environment. Its adverse effects submitted, the final destination of phenol in the environment and its removal is complicated and difficult by several factors: its high solubility in water at room temperature, its ability to ionize, low vapor pressure, its tendency to oxidation, to possess properties and characteristics of reactivity, stability and amphoteric (not biodegradable), can exist in the environment without losing its character under more drastic harmful, causing negative environmental impact. The proposed method offers new technology to recover the phenol is dissolved in industrial water through a chemical reaction with sodium hydroxide, to recover as sodium phenolate, which serves to reuse in the same process of the phenolic resin of novolac type. The secondary distillate from the distillation process of the sodium phenolate solution, even with traces of phenol was adsorbed completely through the bed of granular activated carbon, which guarantees the residual distillate without the presence of phenol for disposal or sewer outfall; contributing the same management and minimization of environmental impacts, particularly the aquatic environment. In the market there are several methodologies for the removal and wastewater treatment in the presence of phenol from the incineration, chemical degradation, biodegradation up heat, but still the resulting constraints are: phenol incineration of gaseous emissions (CO, CO 2, water vapor, etc [...] ) providing to the pollution of air quality and global warming of the planet earth, treatment of phenol biodegradation involves a need for space very large, low concentration of phenol and specialized bacteria are very sensitive to changing conditions, which is not in the treatment of phenolic industrial wastewater and chemical treatment for thermal degradation is very expensive, unlike the physicochemical and absorption method activated charcoal proposed is efficient, easy to use in the treatment of phenol, using input chemicals (NaOH and granular activated carbon) available on the market at low cost, making the method for the recovery of phenol in wastewater proposed industrial sector represents an alternative in the management and treatment of industrial water in order to preserve the aquatic environment mainly. We have developed a new technique physicochemical laboratorial y technique with an resultat eficient outcome, the proposed method has been shown to 96. 17 % recovery of phenol in industrial wastewater and the rest of phenol is treated with the technique of absorption granular activated carbon, which is demonstrated with a 100 % removal of phenol in industrial waste waters, it contributes to the field of science and industry to management, treatment and disposal charge compatible with the preservation and care of the environment, given that their industrial wastewater to the sewer may be available or surface water body (sea, river, lake, etc.), below the allowable limits, according to relevant industry standards, for example, for the Sub Sector Hydrocarbons must have industrial wastewater below the permissible limits, according to Article 1 of Supreme Decree N º 037 - 2008 -PCM "maximum permissible limits for liquid effluents to the Activities Sub-Sector Oil" to not impact the quality of surface waters in compliance of Supreme Decree N º 002 - 2008 -MINAM and Water Resources Act, it contributes to responsible environmental management, which minimizes the impact to aquatic ecosystems. The recovered phenol through the technique described above is broadly applicable in the same production process of phenolic resins. Phenol recovered can also be applied in the wood's conservation (manufacture of plywood, manufacture of pressed wood, iron, melanites, etc.). This research work in the management and treatment of phenol in industrial wastewater proposed, given other environmental tool to companies engaged in the business phenolic, so they can make use of this method in the management and treatment of these hazardous waste and avoid hiring firms EPS-RS for the management, treatment, transportation and disposal of such hazardous waste to a <b>secure</b> <b>landfill,</b> according to Supreme Decree 057 - 2004 -PCM. With this grant is contributing to environmental management that respects the environment, since it does not have the substance be toxic to aquatic ecosystems, which can negatively impact aquatic flora and fauna. To arrive at developing the experimental part, results from a literature search, mainly in journals or magazines for professionals and researchers, as well as communications made in conferences or symposiums, Doctoral thesis, etc. This research has allowed, among other things, support research that is desired to avoid undertaking research already carried out, to take cognizance of experiments already made to repeat them when necessary, further investigations interrupted or incomplete, seeking information suggestive, select a theoretical framework for the literature review. The undersigned concluyes that the research developed as the main objetive of this thesis is an efficient, economical and easy method for the application during the extraction and separation of phenol in industrial wastewater.

En la actualidad, muchas empresas están dedicadas al rubro de plastificantes moldeables, en las refinerías de petróleo, en la industria de química, en la producción de resinas fenólicas principalmente, que generan efluentes residuales industriales con altas concentraciones de compuestos orgánicos, en donde tienen gran destaque la presencia de sustancias fenólicas. En el proceso de producción de resinas fenólicas, existe como subproducto un destilado con presencia de fenol en altas concentraciones (aproximadamente 5 %), que forma parte del efluente residual industrial, siendo esta parte del problema ambiental, que el presente trabajo de investigación propone a la industria una nueva técnica de recuperación, reuso y aporte al ambiente. Sus efectos adversos presentados, el destino final del fenol en el ambiente y su remoción es complicado y difícil por diversos factores: su alta solubilidad en el agua a temperatura ambiente, su habilidad para ionizarse, su baja presión de vapor, su tendencia a la oxidación, por poseer propiedades y características de reactividad, estabilidad y anfotérico (no biodegradable), puede existir en el ambiente sin perder su carácter nocivo en condiciones más drásticas, causando impacto negativo al medio ambiente. El método propuesto propone una nueva tecnología que consiste en recuperar el fenol disuelto en agua industrial a través de una reacción química con hidróxido de sodio, para recuperar como fenolato de sodio, que sirve para reusar en el mismo proceso de la resina fenólica del tipo las novolacas. El destilado secundario del proceso de destilación de la solución fenolato de sodio, aún con trazas de fenol es adsorbido totalmente a través del lecho de carbón activado granulado, que garantiza el destilado residual sin presencia de fenol para su disposición final al alcantarillado o emisor submarino; la misma que contribuye el manejo y minimización de impacto al medio ambiente, en especial al medio acuático. En el mercado existen varios metodologías para la remoción y tratamiento de aguas residuales con presencia de fenol desde la incineración, biodegradación hasta degradación química térmica, siendo los limitantes más resultantes tenemos: la incineración de fenol genera emisiones gaseosas (CO, CO 2, vapor de agua, etc.) que aporta a la contaminación de la calidad de aire y al calentamiento global de la planeta tierra; tratamiento de fenol por biodegradación involucra necesidad de contar con un espacio muy grande, con baja concentración de fenol y bacterias pecializadas muy sensibles al cambio de condiciones, que no es aplicable en el tratamiento de aguas residuales industriales con fenol; y el tratamiento por degradación química térmica es muy costoso, a diferencia del método fisicoquímico y absorción con carbón activado propuesto, es eficiente, fácil manejo en el tratamiento de fenol, uso de insumo químico comercial (NaOH y carbón activado granulado) a disposición en el mercado con un costo bajo, haciendo que el método para la recuperación de fenol en aguas residuales industriales propuesto represente al sector industrial una alternativa en el manejo y tratamiento de dicho agua industrial con la finalidad de preservar el ambiente acuático principalmente. Se ha desarrollado una nueva técnica fisicoquímica a nivel de laboratorio con resultado eficiente, es decir, con el método propuesto se ha demostrado la recuperación al 96. 17 % de fenol en aguas residuales industriales y, el resto de fenol es tratado con la técnica de absorción con carbón activado granulado, con el cual se demuestra una remoción del 100 % de fenol en aguas industriales, la misma que contribuye al campo científico y al sector industrial a un manejo, tratamiento y disposición final responsable compatible con la preservación y cuidado al medio ambiente, toda vez que sus aguas residuales industriales se puede disponer al alcantarillado o al cuerpo de agua superficial (mar, río, laguna, etc.), por debajo de los límites permitidos, según las normas del sector correspondiente; por ejemplo, para el Sub Sector Hidrocarburos, hay que disponer las aguas residuales industriales por debajo de los límites permisibles, de acuerdo al Art. 1 º del Decreto Supremo Nº 037 - 2008 -PCM “Límites Máximos Permisibles de Efluentes Líquidos para las Actividades del Sub-Sector Hidrocarburos”, a fin de no impactar la calidad de aguas superficiales, en cumplimiento del Decreto Supremo Nº 002 - 2008 -MINAM y la Ley de Recursos Hídricos, la misma que contribuye a un manejo ambiental responsable, que minimiza el impacto al ecosistema acuático. El fenol recuperado a través de la técnica descrito en líneas arriba tiene aplicación en el mismo proceso de producción de resinas fenólicas. También el fenol recuperado puede tener aplicación en el tratamiento de maderas (fabricación de triplay, fabricación de madera prensado, planchas, melanitas, etc.) como preservativos. Con el presente trabajo de investigación en el manejo y tratamiento de fenol en aguas residuales industriales se propone otra herramienta ambiental a las empresas dedicadas en el rubro fenólicas, para que pueden hacer uso de este método en el manejo y tratamiento de estos residuos peligrosos y así evitar contratar empresas EPS-RS para el manejo, tratamiento, transporte y disposición final de dicho residuo peligroso a un relleno de seguridad, de acuerdo al Decreto Supremo N° 057 - 2004 -PCM. Con este aporte se está contribuyendo al manejo ambiental responsable con el medio ambiente, toda vez que no se va disponer la sustancia toxica al ecosistema acuático, que puede impactar negativamente a la flora y fauna acuática. Para llegar a desarrollar la parte experimental, se ha realizado una investigación bibliográfica, fundamentalmente en journals o revistas destinadas a profesionales e investigadores, como así también las comunicaciones hechas en Congresos o Simposios, tesis de doctorado, etc. Esta indagación ha permitido, entre otras cosas, apoyar la investigación que se desea realizar, evitar emprender investigaciones ya realizadas, tomar conocimiento de experimentos ya hechos para repetirlos cuando sea necesario, continuar investigaciones interrumpidas o incompletas, buscar información sugerente, seleccionar un marco teórico para el estudio bibliográfico.

This highlights the importance of landfills in MSW management in Malaysia. However, sustainable landfilling technology is yet to be achieved. This paper deliberates the scenarios of landfilling in Malaysia. Past and present status is thoroughly discussed while future prospects will be scrutinized. During the 1970 s, the disposal sites were small and mere open-dumping grounds to cater small communities.

40|$|The {{powdered}} solids trapped in filter sleeves in the aluminium tertiary industry are currently disposed of in <b>secure</b> <b>landfills</b> {{as a result}} of environmental considerations. Their classification as a hazardous waste is due to their high aluminium content as metallic aluminium or in compounds such as aluminium nitride. These compounds can react with a very low moisture content to release toxic or hazardous gases such as hydrogen and ammonia. This paper presents a low-cost process for the full recovery of this hazardous waste in three steps leading to the production of two different added-value materials. In the first step, mild acid hydrolysis of the waste is carried out to obtain a concentrated aluminium solution and an inert cake. The following steps consist of hydrotalcite synthesis with the resulting solution, and the production of transparent glasses in the CaO–Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 system with the cake. Characterisation of the products obtained indicates that the hydrotalcites can adsorb anionic pollutants (molybdates) in a simple way, while the glasses afford improved optical properties in comparison with those prepared by direct vitrification of the waste.

40|$|Incineration of {{industrial}} waste produces {{large quantities of}} bottom ash which are normally sent to <b>secured</b> <b>landfill,</b> but is not a sustainable solution. Use of bottom ash in engineering applications will contribute to sustainability and generate revenue. One way of using the industrial waste incineration bottom ash is in controlled low-strength material (CLSM). Use of bottom ash in CLSM has problems related to bleeding and excessive strength development and so an additive has {{to be used to}} control bleeding and strength development. The main objective of this research is to study the effect of kaolin addition on the performance of CLSM made using industrial waste incineration bottom ash. CLSM mixes were made with bottom ash, cement, and refined kaolin. Various tests were performed on the CLSM in fresh and hardened states including compressive strength, water absorption, California bearing ratio (CBR) and the tests for concentration of leachable substances on the bleed and leachate. The compressive strength of CLSM tested ranged from 0. 11 to 9. 86 MPa. CBR values ranged from 6 to 46, and water absorption values from 12 to 36. It was shown that the addition of kaolin delayed the initial setting time of CLSM mixtures, reduced bleeding, lowered the compressive strength, and increased the values of water absorption, sorption, and initial surface absorption. The CLSM tested did not have corrosivity. It was shown that the hardened CLSM was non hazardous, and the addition of kaolin increased the concentration of heavy metals and salts in the bleed and leachate...|$|R
40|$|Background, aim {{and scope}} Once they have been generated, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and other {{persistent}} organic pollutants (POPs) can persist in soils and sediments and in waste repositories for periods extending from decades to centuries. In 1994, the US EPA concluded that contaminated sites and other reservoirs {{are likely to become}} the major source of contemporary pollution problems with these substances. With this in mind, this article is the first in a new series in ESPR under the title ‘Case Studies on Dioxin and POP Contaminated Sites—Contemporary and Future Relevance and Challenges’, which will address this important issue. The series will document various experiences from sites contaminated with PCDD/F and other POPs. This article provides an overview of the content of the articles comprising the series. In addition, it provides a review of the subject in its own right and identifies the key issues arising from dioxin/POP-contaminated sites. Additionally, it highlights the important conclusions that can be drawn from these examples. The key aim of this article and of the series as a whole is to provide a comprehensive overview of the types of PCDD/F contaminated sites that exist as a result of historical activities. It details the various processes whereby these sites became contaminated and attempts to evaluate their contemporary relevance as sources of PCDD/Fs and other POPs. It also details the various strategies used to assess these historical legacies of contamination and the concepts developed, or which are under development, to effect their remediation. Main features Special sessions on ‘Contaminated sites—Cases, remediation, risk and policy’ were held at the DIOXIN conferences in 2006 and 2007, and this theme will be continued at DIOXIN 2008 to be held in Birmingham. Selected cases from the approximately 70 contributions made to these sessions, together with some additional invited case studies are outlined together with the key issues they raise. By evaluating these cases and adding details of experiences published in the current literature, an overview will be given of the different features and challenges of dioxin and POP-contaminated sites. Results This article provides a systematic categorisation of types of PCDD/F and POP-contaminated sites. These are categorised according to the chemical or manufacturing process, which generated the PCDD/Fs or POPs and also includes the use and disposal aspects of the product life cycle in question. The highest historical PCDD/F and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination burdens have arisen {{as a result of the}} production of chlorine and of chlorinated organic chemicals. In particular, the production of chlorinated pesticides, PCBs and the related contaminated waste streams are identified being responsible for historical releases of toxic equivalents (TEQs) at a scale of many tonnes. Along with such releases, major PCDD/F contaminated sites have been created through the application or improper disposal of contaminated pesticides, PCBs and other organochlorine chemicals, as well through the recycling of wastes and their attempted destruction. In some extreme examples, PCDD/F contaminated sites have also resulted from thermal processes such as waste incinerators, secondary metal industries or from the recycling or deposition of specific waste (e. g. electronic waste or car shredder wastes), which often contain chlorinated or brominated organic chemicals. The examples of PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCB contamination of fish in European rivers or the impact of contaminated sites upon fishing grounds and upon other food resources demonstrate the relevance of these historical problems to current and future human generations. Many of the recent food contamination problems that have emerged in Europe and elsewhere demonstrate how PCDD/F and dioxin like PCBs from historical sources can directly contaminate human and animal feedstuffs and indeed highlight their considerable contemporary relevance in this respect. Accordingly, some key experiences and lessons learnt regarding the production, use, disposal and remediation of POPs from the contaminated sites are summarised. Discussion An important criterion for evaluating the significance and risks of PCDD/Fs and other POPs at contaminated sites is their present or future potential for mobility. This, in turn, determines to a large degree their propensity for off-site transport and environmental accessibility. The detailed evaluation of contaminated site cases reveals different site-specific factors, which influence the varied pathways through which poor water-soluble POPs can be mobilised. Co-contaminants with greater water solubility are also typically present at such sites. Hence, pumping of groundwater (pump and treat) is often required in addition to attempting to physically secure a site. At an increasing number of contaminated sites, securing measures are failing after relatively short time spans compared to the time horizon, which applies to persistent organic pollutant contamination. Due to the immense costs and challenges associated with remediation of contaminated sites ‘monitored natural attenuation’ is increasingly gaining purchase as a conceptual remediation approach. However, these concepts may well prove limited in their practical application to contaminated sites containing persistent organic pollutants and other key pollutants like heavy metals. Conclusions It is inevitable, therefore, that dioxin/POP-contaminated sites will remain of contemporary and future relevance. They will continue to represent an environmental issue for future generations to address. The securing and/or remediation of dioxin/POP-contaminated sites is very costly, generally in the order of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. <b>Secured</b> <b>landfills</b> and <b>secured</b> production sites need to be considered as constructions not made for ‘eternity’ but built for a finite time scale. Accordingly, they will need to be controlled, supervised and potentially repaired/renewed. Furthermore, the leachates and groundwater impacted by these sites will require ongoing monitoring and potential further remediation. These activities result in high maintenance costs, which are accrued for decades or centuries and should, therefore, be compared to the fully sustainable option of complete remediation. The contaminated site case studies highlight that, while extensive policies and established funds for remediation exist in most of the industrialised western countries, even these relatively well-regulated and wealthy countries face significant challenges in the implementation of a remediation strategy. This highlights the fact that ultimately only the prevention of contaminated sites represents a sustainable solution for the future and that the Polluter Pays Principle needs to be applied in a comprehensive way to current problems and those which may emerge in the future. Recommendations and perspectives With the continuing shift of industrial activities in developing and transition economies, which often have poor regulation (and weak self-regulation of industries), additional global challenges regarding POPs and other contaminated sites may be expected. In this respect, a comprehensive application of the “polluter pays principle” in these countries will also be a key to facilitate the clean-up of contaminated areas and the prevention of future contaminated sites. The threats and challenges of contaminated sites and the high costs of securing/remediating the problems highlight the need for a comprehensive approach based upon integrated pollution prevention and control. If applied to all polluting (and potentially polluting) industrial sectors around the globe, such an approach will prove to be both the cheapest and most sustainable way to underpin the development of industries in developing and transition economie...|$|R
