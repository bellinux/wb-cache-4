She was a heavy smoker, and died from a lung disease and the boys are associated with her death.|$|E

25|$|When she was thirteen, Schröter and {{her family}} moved to Leipzig. It was there that <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> {{attention}} of composer Johann Adam Hiller (it is thought that Hiller's wife was Corona's godmother). Hiller, an operatic and singspiel composer, had become seriously frustrated with the inadequate education offered to women. To remedy this, in 1771 Hiller opened his own school. In this coeducational setting, students learned {{a wide variety of}} musical subjects, including solfège, diction, technique, Italian, and the keyboard. Schröter flourished as a singer, and benefited from the non-damaging technique she learned. Corona was a powerful performer, but was often compared to her fellow student and rival, Gertrud Schmeling (Madame Mara) in Hiller's Grosse Konzerte series. Schröter's voice was not as powerful as Schmeling's, due to her poor early training. However, she had an intensity which her admirers considered to be unrivaled.|$|E
25|$|During {{a two-week}} {{engagement}} {{at a club}} in midtown Manhattan called Little Russia, Merman met agent Lou Irwin, who arranged for her to audition for Archie Mayo, a film director under contract at Warner Bros. He offered her an exclusive six-month contract, starting at $125 per week, and Merman quit her day job, only to find herself idle for weeks while waiting to be cast in a film. She finally urged Irwin to try to cancel her agreement with Mayo; instead, he negotiated her a better deal allowing her to perform in clubs while remaining on the Warners payroll. Merman {{was hired as a}} torch singer at Les Ambassadeurs, where the headliner was Jimmy Durante, and the two became lifelong friends. <b>She</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> attention of columnists such as Walter Winchell and Mark Hellinger, who began giving her publicity. Soon after, Merman underwent a tonsillectomy she feared might damage her voice, but after recovering, she discovered it was more powerful than ever.|$|E
25|$|At the , <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> {{attention}} of many {{by winning the}} Ford Hot Shots competition and defeating defending champion Colleen Jones in the first draw. After falling to a record of 2-4, she rallied by winning four of her next five games, finishing 6-5. This was enough, however, {{to get into a}} four-way tie for fourth place. Hanna would end up winning both of her tie-breakers, against Cathy King of Alberta and Sandy Comeau of New Brunswick, allowing her to make the playoffs. She then proceeded to defeat Stefanie Lawton of Saskatchewan in the 3 vs. 4 game, followed by Kelly Scott of British Columbia in the semi-final, to face the Jennifer Jones rink from Manitoba in the final. At this stage, Hanna's team played well, and led for most of the game, but lost on the last rock to Jones' game saving in-off for four points. Hanna was named the tournament MVP, and was chosen for the second all-star team.|$|E

That same year, Berry had her first co-starring role in Strictly Business. In 1992, Berry portrayed a career woman who falls for the lead {{character}} played by Eddie Murphy in the romantic comedy Boomerang. The following year, <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> public's attention as a headstrong biracial slave in the TV adaptation of , {{based on the book}} by Alex Haley.

500|$|In 1526, King Henry became enamoured with Anne {{and began}} his pursuit. [...] Anne was a {{skillful}} player {{at the game}} of courtly love, which was often played in the antechambers. This may have been how <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> eye of Henry, who was also an experienced player. Some say that Anne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her, refusing to become his mistress, often leaving court for the seclusion of Hever Castle. But within a year, he proposed marriage to her, and she accepted. Both assumed an annulment could be obtained {{within a matter of}} months. There is no evidence to suggest that they engaged in a sexual relationship until very shortly before their marriage; Henry's love letters to Anne suggest that their love affair remained unconsummated for much of their seven-year courtship.|$|E
500|$|Described by her biographer Wes Gehring as [...] "a free-spirited tomboy", {{the young}} Lombard was passionately {{involved}} {{in sports and}} enjoyed watching movies. At Virgil Junior High School, she participated in tennis, volleyball, and swimming, and won trophies for her achievements in athletics. At the age of 12, this hobby unexpectedly landed Lombard her first screen role. While playing baseball with friends, <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> attention of the film director Allan Dwan, who later recalled seeing [...] "a cute-looking little tomboy... out there knocking {{the hell out of}} the other kids, playing better baseball than they were. And I needed someone of her type for this picture." [...] With the encouragement of her mother, Lombard happily took a small role in the melodrama A Perfect Crime (1921). She was on set for two days, playing the sister of Monte Blue. Dwan later commented, [...] "She ate it up".|$|E
5000|$|The CurtainUp {{reviewer}} of the Off-Broadway production wrote: [...] " [...] 'Dirty Blonde' ...is {{very much}} a play; in fact, it has enough music, including Bob Stillman's eponymous original song, to be classified as a play with music The monologist has become a mature playwright. The stand-up comic has developed enough depth to render two engaging character portraits. Her Mae {{may not be true}} blue West but <b>she's</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> essence of 'the movie equivalent of Venice.'" ...|$|R

500|$|When a {{majority}} of the nation's newspapers expressed support of the strikers, Goldman and Berkman resolved to assassinate Frick, an action they expected would inspire the workers to revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman chose to carry out the assassination, and ordered Goldman to stay behind in order to explain his motives after he went to jail. He would {{be in charge of the}} deed; she of the word. Berkman tried and failed to make a bomb, then set off for Pittsburgh to buy a gun and a suit of decent clothes. Goldman, meanwhile, decided to help fund the scheme through prostitution. Remembering the character of Sonya in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment (1866), she mused: [...] "She had become a prostitute in order to support her little brothers and sisters...Sensitive Sonya could sell her body; why not I?" [...] Once on the street, <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> eye of a man who took her into a saloon, bought her a beer, gave her ten dollars, informed her she did not have [...] "the knack," [...] and told her to quit the business. She was [...] "too astounded for speech". She wrote to Helena, claiming illness, and asked her for fifteen dollars.|$|E
2500|$|Joan {{had been}} a widow for only {{a little over a}} year when <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> eye of Ralph de Monthermer, a squire in Joan’s father’s household. Joan fell in love and {{convinced}} her father to have Monthermer knighted. It was unheard of in European royalty for a noble lady to even converse with a man who had not won or acquired importance in the household. However, in January 1297 Joan secretly married [...] Ralph. Joan's father was already planning another marriage for Joan to Amadeus V, Count of Savoy, to occur 16 March 1297. Joan was in a dangerous predicament, as she was already married, unbeknownst to her father.|$|E
2500|$|Kwan had {{her first}} taste of the limelight in 1986 when she became one of twelve finalists in TVB's New Talent Singing Awards, along with Andy Hui and Leon Lai, but lost to both.

[...] "I thought he meant a school for juvenile delinquents." [...] Eventually her mother agreed and at age twelve she won a full scholarship to the Italia Conti Academy. Despite the encouragement she received from family, friends, and teachers, her big boost of confidence came from a very unlikely source: a clairvoyant who predicted that she would become famous, especially in America. Some of her earliest work included an appearance on The Tommy Steele Show when she was thirteen, and as a model for My Guy magazine.|$|E
