25|$|After their blowout loss at {{home against}} Tennessee, Alabama dropped from the No. 20 {{position}} out of the AP Poll altogether prior to their game at Clemson. At Memorial Stadium, the Crimson Tide ended their two-game losing <b>steak</b> <b>with</b> this 38–13 win over the Tigers of the Atlantic Coast Conference.

500|$|Nightmare Cafeteria was {{the first}} Simpsons story to be written by David X. Cohen. He wrote the final scene where a nightmarish fog turns the family [...] "inside out". This was {{inspired}} by a thriller featured on the radio show Lights Out called [...] "The Dark", which frightened Cohen as a child. A dance number was added immediately afterwards in order to end the show on a lighter note. He also cut two scenes from this segment featuring Sherri and Terri being cooked as [...] "Teriyaki" [...] <b>steak</b> <b>with</b> a [...] "Sherry" [...] sauce and Homer regaling Lisa about his dream of eating Milhouse. Regardless, a book from this scene was featured in this segment. As a result of this scene being cut, Homer does not appear in the third segment, something Cohen thought never happened before. The [...] "grade F meat" [...] joke was written by Mirkin, inspired by his cousin once seeing a box of hot dogs labeled [...] "grade C, approved for human consumption".|$|E

40|$|Infraspinatus (top blade), gluteus medius (top sirloin), and psoas major (tenderloin) steaks were {{obtained}} from A- and B-maturity carcasses that had either a high (≥ 6. 0) or normal (≤ 5. 7) pH, and either slight or small marbling. The steaks were vacuum aged until either 7, 14, 21, or 35 days postmortem. The steaks were broiled and served to a highly trained flavor-profile sensory panel. <b>Steaks</b> <b>with</b> livery flavor were subjected to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses for flavor compounds. Steaks aged until 7 or 35 days postmortem were analyzed for the 2 - thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content to determine lipid oxidation and for myoglobin and hemoglobin concentrations. Thirteen different volatile compounds had greater amounts in <b>steaks</b> <b>with</b> livery flavor. Lipid oxidation of raw steaks {{was not related to}} livery flavor, but steak myoglobin concentration was related to livery flavor...|$|R
2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} claims comes from Charlie Nagreen, who in 1885 sold a meatball between two slices of bread at the Seymour Fair now sometimes called the Outagamie County Fair. The Seymour Community Historical Society of Seymour, Wisconsin, credits Nagreen, now known as [...] "Hamburger Charlie", with the invention. Nagreen was fifteen when he was reportedly selling pork sandwiches at the 1885 Seymour Fair, made so customers could eat while walking. The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the Hamburg <b>steak</b> <b>with</b> which local German immigrants were familiar.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{vegetables}} {{that come with}} the hamburger, the first described in the literature on its history is the onion, usually finely sliced in rings. Thus, the hamburger came to continue the long American tradition of sandwiches featuring some kind of plant product, whether that be lettuce (as {{in the case of the}} BLT sandwich), sauerkraut (as on the reuben), coleslaw, or pickles. It is possible that after the creation of the hamburger by uniting the <b>steak</b> <b>with</b> the bread, vegetables were included to give the finished product a more [...] "natural" [...] appearance and taste. All of these condiments were incorporated into the classical image of the hamburger during its golden age, the 1940s. In some cases, the hamburger is prepared differently and distinctly to add regional flavor, as in the case of Tex-Mex style burgers, which are served with a side of chili con carne.|$|E
