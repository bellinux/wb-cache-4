The model was applied for simulation of PDs within the void in cable insulation geometry to increase the understanding on PD physical phenomena.

There are now around 15 people working at the museum, welcoming visitors from around the world and managing with a constant flow of research enquiries from academics, family historians, local historians and the media. The most recent chapter in the museum's development involves the sensitive re-development of the Grade II listed buildings to accommodate greater exhibitions space, and improved visitor facilities including a cafe and greater accessibility.

This study considers a two-dimensional model describing the motion of a flexible, inextensible cable {{in the presence of}} hydrodynamic drag forces in an incompressible fluid. In the first part the forward model is introduced and then solved to yield the cable’s velocity, curvature and tension in the knowledge of the towing vessel motion and the hydrodynamic loads applied. In sequence, we formulate the inverse problem of inferring the ocean current velocities from discrete <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cable’s</b> shape and tension and show that this is rank deficient and ill-posed. In approaching the inverse problem a numerically stable algorithm is adopted based on generalized Tikhonov regularization, in the context of robust differentiation of discrete noisy signals.

It is known that depending on switching frequency, cable configuration and length, transient overvoltage effects comprising a wide frequency range from dc up to several tens of MHz can appear. However, to accurately reproduce the wide-band frequency response, such models often require the use of ladder networks, thus being necessary to adjust the values of a relatively large number of R, L and C components, which is a complex task.
