This study considers a two-dimensional model describing the motion of a flexible, inextensible cable {{in the presence of}} hydrodynamic drag forces in an incompressible fluid.

In sequence, we formulate the inverse problem of inferring the ocean current velocities from discrete <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cableâs</b> shape and tension and show that this is rank deficient and ill-posed.

It is known that depending on switching frequency, cable configuration and length, transient overvoltage effects comprising a wide frequency range from dc up to several tens of MHz can appear. However, to accurately reproduce the wide-band frequency response, such models often require the use of ladder networks, thus being necessary to adjust the values of a relatively large number of R, L and C components, which is a complex task.
