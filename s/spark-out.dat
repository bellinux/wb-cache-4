50|$|The machine {{consists}} of a table that traverses both longitudinally and {{across the face of}} the wheel. The longitudinal feed is usually powered by hydraulics, as may the cross feed, however any mixture of hand, electrical or hydraulic may be used depending on the ultimate usage of the machine (i.e., production, workshop, cost). The grinding wheel rotates in the spindle head and is also adjustable for height, by any of the methods described previously. Modern surface grinders are semi-automated, depth of cut and <b>spark-out</b> may be preset as to the number of passes and, once set up, the machining process requires very little operator intervention.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Relationship {{between the}} static {{stiffness}} of grinding {{system and the}} depth of surface affected layers generated in a grinding operation is experimentally investigated. A method to realize grinding without any surface affected layers is proposed. The influence of static stiffness on grinding force is considered. It is confirmed that the surface affected layers are generated during an infeeding process, in which a large grinding force is involved. The layers are then removed in a <b>spark-out</b> process. According to this, it is clear that, if the elastic deformation is utilized effectively, the surface affected layers can be removed in the <b>spark-out</b> process...|$|E

This paper demonstrates that <b>spark-out</b> {{is the most important}} stage of a plunge grinding cycle for achievement of a low value of roughness. The nature of the <b>spark-out</b> process is investigated including the effects of machine stiffness, system deflection, wheel sharpness and plastic deformation on improvement of surface roughness. Experiments and a comparison with predictions from a computer simulation programme demonstrate the effects of the fundamental factors. It is demon-strated that the time constant for roughness is more than twice the time constant for system deflections...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} new {{innovative}} concept approaching the optimum cylindrical plunge dry grinding. The concept {{is based on}} the individual dressing operation in order to create designed structures on the grinding wheel surface. Cylindrical plunge dry grinding experiments have been carried out by employing both structured wheels and normal wheels. The results show that dry grinding with the structured wheel leads to lower grinding forces, area-specific grinding energy, and thermal damages to the workpiece as compared to the case of grinding with the normal wheel. The relatively higher surface roughness values, although, were resulted in the case of applying the structured wheel, they may be lowered by an additional <b>spark-out</b> pass to the values obtained with using the normal wheel...|$|E
40|$|In {{production}} engineering, {{monitoring of}} the grinding process is critical for acquiring information on material removal, wheel performance, and workpiece quality. Here, a general model of the power signal and material removal rate is proposed to monitor the internal plunge grinding of a bearing outer race way product. Three continuous grinding cycles after dressing were used to analyse the roughing, semi-finishing, finishing and <b>spark-out</b> process under the same parameters. Based on the actual grinding process, a practical analysis method is applied to improve the general model to predict more accurately the power curve. Finally, estimations of grinding wheel performance and grind quality using the grinding power signal model (GPSM) coefficients are also presented. The experimental {{results showed that the}} improved power signal model is capable of solving the industrial problem of multi-stage in-feed grinding cycles and improving grind quality...|$|E
40|$|Three plunge {{grinding}} control methods are discussed, {{and it is}} shown in control engineering terms that the process is one of motion control and that {{the differences between the}} various control methods lie in the control algorithms implemented in software using a common hardware system. A new control method is proposed for an improvement in grinding efficiency and is described as the optimum size and roundness adaptive control method. An accurate description of the control actions is provided, and the adaptive algorithm used by the proposed method also enables a low-cost computer system to be used. A case study of the grinding process based on a simulation is presented to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed control method. The experimental results for validating the proposed control method will be the subject of a separate publication.

40|$|Surface {{grinding}} is {{a fundamental}} material removal process that involves forces during machining. The forces would cause deformation in the machine tool system and the workpiece. Because of the deformation, the required volume of workpiece material cannot be removed completely, causing an error in the workpiece surface profile. A typical solution to solve this type of problem {{is to use a}} method called <b>spark-out.</b> However, the efficiency of the <b>spark-out</b> method is low and the error in the surface profile cannot be eliminated completely within a limited number of grinding passes. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency, a new method based on an active compensator is proposed and investigated. The compensator is essentially utilizes a method of increasing the depth of cut in order to remove the required volume of workpiece material. In this method, the relationship between the nominal depth of cut and the deformation is established and the effect of deformation during grinding is controlled. In order to realize the proposed method, a workpiece micro positioning table has been designed and manufactured to generate a compensation action. In the workpiece table, a piezoelectric actuator is used. Its fine resolution and no backlash help the workpiece table to achieve very high performance. The design of the workpiece micro positioning table was assisted by using a FEA software called ANSYS and a high stiffness in the workpiece table has been achieved. Because of the stiffness of piezoelectric actuator is only 17 N/μm, a capacitive sensor has been used to detect the position of the workpiece table and the position is used as the feedback for closed-loop control of the workpiece table. PID control is applied and good performance has been achieved. The developed workpiece table has a natural frequency of 223 Hz and a static stiffness of 43 - 65 N/μm at the comers and a static stiffness greater than 400 N/μm at the center under the condition of closed loop control. Experimental testing has been carried out to test the proposed method. The initial workpiece shape prepared was an inclined straight surface with an error of 10 μm. The experimental testing shows that the error could be reduced to approximately 2 μm after two grinding passes, representing an improvement of nearly 50 % in the resulting workpiece surface profile accuracy...|$|E
