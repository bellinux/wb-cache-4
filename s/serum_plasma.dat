2500|$|The histidine-rich protein II (HRP II) is a histidine- and alanine-rich, {{water-soluble}} protein, {{which is}} localized in several cell compartments including the parasite cytoplasm. The antigen is expressed only by P. falciparum trophozoites. HRP II from P. falciparum has {{been implicated in}} the biocrystallization of hemozoin, an inert, crystalline form of ferriprotoporphyrin IX (Fe(3+)-PPIX) produced by the parasite. [...] A substantial amount of the HRP II is secreted by the parasite into the host bloodstream and the antigen can be detected in erythrocytes, <b>serum,</b> <b>plasma,</b> cerebrospinal fluid and even urine as a secreted water-soluble protein. These antigens persist in the circulating blood after the parasitaemia has cleared or has been greatly reduced. It generally takes around two weeks after successful treatment for HRP2-based tests to turn negative, but may {{take as long as}} one month, which compromises their value in the detection of active infection. False positive dipstick results were reported in patients with rheumatoid-factor-positive rheumatoid arthritis. Since HRP-2 is expressed only by P. falciparum, these tests will give negative results with samples containing only P. vivax, P. ovale, or P. malariae; many cases of non-falciparum malaria may therefore be misdiagnosed as malaria negative (some P.falciparum strains also don’t have HRP II). The variability in the results of pHRP2-based RDTs is related to the variability in the target antigen.|$|E
2500|$|One often {{overlooked}} source of exposure {{occurs when a}} pregnant woman is exposed, thereby exposing the fetus. Animal {{studies have shown that}} BPA can be found in both the placenta and the amniotic fluid of pregnant mice. Since BPA was also [...] "detected in the urine and serum of pregnant women and the <b>serum,</b> <b>plasma,</b> and placenta of newborn infants" [...] a study to examine the externalizing behaviors associated with prenatal exposure to BPA was performed which suggests that exposures earlier in development have more of an effect on the behavior outcomes and that female children (2-years-old) are impacted more than males. A small US study in 2009, funded by the Environmental Working Group, detected an average of 2.8ng/mL BPA in the blood of 9 out of the 10 umbilical cords tested. A study of 244 mothers indicated that exposure to BPA before birth could affect the behavior of girls at age 3. Girls whose mother's urine contained high levels of BPA during pregnancy scored worse on tests of anxiety and hyperactivity. Although these girls still scored within a normal range, for every 10-fold increase in the BPA of the mother, the girls scored at least six points lower on the tests. Boys {{did not seem to be}} affected by their mother's BPA levels during pregnancy. After the baby is born, maternal exposure can continue to affect the infant through transfer of BPA to the infant via breast milk. Because of these exposures that can occur both during and after pregnancy, mothers wishing to limit their child's exposure to BPA should attempt to limit their own exposures during that time period.|$|E

The present study sequenced microRNAs (miRNAs) in the <b>serum</b> and <b>plasma</b> of pregnant females using next generation sequencing tech-nology. Several differentially expressed miRNAs were also verified by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In total, 329 miRNAs and 193 miRNAs were detected in maternal <b>serum</b> and <b>plasma.</b> Differential expression and different types of miRNAs were found in the <b>serum</b> and <b>plasma,</b> among them, 19 were upregulated and 6 were downregulated in serum when compared with plasma with a fold change> 2. 0 (P< 0. 001).

The results obtained using RT-qPCR in the selected miRNAs were similar to these results, and indicated that the differential expression of miRNAs in the <b>serum</b> and <b>plasma</b> provide a guide for further investigation and clinical use.
