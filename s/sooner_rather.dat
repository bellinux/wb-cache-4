5|$|A {{systemic}} transformation happening <b>sooner</b> <b>rather</b> {{than later}} {{was made possible}} by the Polish legislative elections of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protesters in China. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the Sejm, while in the newly established Senate they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (the other seat went to an independent, who later switched to Solidarity). At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them. The communists suffered a catastrophic blow to their legitimacy.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} proved that climate change will affect Nicaragua <b>sooner</b> <b>rather</b> than later due to its {{geographic}} location in the traditional path of strong Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes. Planning efforts in Nicaragua are directed towards adapting to wider climate variability including stronger storms in some years and more severe droughts in others, and higher temperatures that will provoke increased evaporation. This will lead to even drier years than the Nicaraguan agriculture had already suffered in past decades. Moreover, {{there is a high}} deforestation rate in Nicaragua that makes the country even more vulnerable to climate change induced flooding and landslides.|$|E
25|$|The {{high cost}} of IGCC is the biggest {{obstacle}} to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring carbon reduction are being proposed again both the House and the Senate, and with the Democratic majority {{it seems likely that}} with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.) also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming <b>sooner,</b> <b>rather</b> than later. With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a pulverized coal plant, the increase is approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry needs a lot more experience to reduce the risk premium. IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.|$|E

25|$|He {{returned}} home in 1936, recently promoted to full general, to lead Eastern Command, {{one of the}} corps-level regional commands in the United Kingdom, responsible for a single Regular division and three Territorial Army divisions. Here, he realised that a European War would come <b>sooner</b> <b>rather</b> than later, and that the Army was in a parlous state to defend the country. However, he found that as with his earlier posts, he could achieve little in Eastern Command – the most important decisions being made in Whitehall. He himself seemed to lose his opportunity for higher office in 1937, when he was rebuked over his mishandling of a mobile force in the annual exercises; until this point, he had been considered a possible candidate as Chief of the Imperial General Staff, but was dropped from consideration in favour of Lord Gort, whom Ironside considered unfit for the job. Lord Hore-Belisha gave him official notice that he was deemed too old for the post, aged 57. Thus, he was appointed an Aide-de-Camp to HM the King in October, a purely ceremonial position, and early in 1938 accepted the offer of Governor of Gibraltar, generally seen as a quiet role where to retire.|$|E

500|$|Despite their {{sometimes}} differing viewpoints, {{these experts}} generally agree that Bismarck would have eventually foundered if the Germans had not scuttled her first.

500|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. Goebbels {{was one of the most}} enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies <b>sooner</b> <b>rather</b> than later. At the time of the Reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: [...] "ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing." [...] In the lead-up to the Sudetenland crisis in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the Sudeten Germans while campaigning against the Czech government. Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing [...] "war panic" [...] in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity. After the western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in Danzig and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war. He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.|$|E

40|$|The lens of {{behavioral}} decision theory {{offers a new}} perspective for research on time management.

The authors performed 2 experimental studies to test whether people are sensitive to differences in the discounted utility of time management decisions. In Experiment 1, they used vignettes of typical time management situations; Experiment 2 was a laboratory simulation (an in-basket task that was part of a training assessment). Participants were 41 and 43 German university students, respectively. As expected, manipulating the discounted utility of options resulted in different time management decisions. In Experiment 1, reactions to time management situations were judged as less likely if the reactions had lower discounted utilities. In Experiment 2, people spent less time on an interruption...|$|R

Moreover, “innovation in SMEs is hampered by lack of financial resources, scant opportunities to recruit specialized workers, and small innovation portfolios so that risks associated with innovation cannot be spread.

2500|$|During {{his time}} in Berlin Thaer had an {{encounter}} with Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, {{the head of the}} German General Staff, who was of course several ranks senior to Thaer's.

[...] In 1910 von Thaer returned from an absence of several months during which he had been on holiday in Russia and reported back {{to the head of the}} chief of staff, General von Moltke. [...] Von Moltke invited his candid opinion on the state of relations between Germany and Russia. [...] It seems likely that von Moltke misunderstood his junior officer's reply. [...] He understood von Thaer to have advocated a Preventive war against Russia. [...] There was much concern in Germany at this time that the military power balance with Russia was shifting in Russia's favour, and there were many who thought that since military confrontation was inevitable, the outcome would be more likely to favour the German empire if war came <b>sooner</b> <b>rather</b> than later. [...] Von Moltke was firmly opposed to the [...] "preventive war" [...] idea, however. [...] Thaer, in his report of his conversation with von Moltke, insists that he too was similarly opposed to any [...] "preventive war" [...] proposals. [...] But that seems not to have been what von Moltke thought he had heard. [...] In any case, von Molkte concluded the interview frostily with the formal phrase, [...] "Ich danke Ihnen, Herr Hauptmann" [...] ("I thank you, Mr Officer"). [...] Thaer saw this choice of words as an insult. [...] The customary formulation at the time (even if strictly speaking [...] "incorrect") would have been [...] "Ich danke Ihnen, Thaer", using the name of a brother officer despite the difference in their actual ranks. [...] Thaer waited for 24 hours and then submitted a complaint. [...] Von Moltke apologised and clarified the matter to him.

Berrys character was thought up overnight and had been scheduled to appear later, however he was introduced to restore the cast balance distorted by the unexpected departure of actor David Scarboro who played the original Mark Fowler. Scarboros departure meant many of his functions as one of the more senior of the young characters would need to be taken over by another character and thus Wicksy was introduced <b>rather</b> <b>sooner</b> than originally planned and Berry was cast with minimal delay.

40|$|When {{faced with}} choices between smaller sooner options and larger later options (i. e. intertemporal choices), both humans and {{non-human}} animals discount future rewards. Apparently, only humans consistently show the magnitude effect, {{according to which}} larger options are discounted over time at a lower rate than smaller options. Most of the studies carried out in non-human animals led instead to negative results. Here, we tested ten tufted capuchin monkeys (Sapajus spp.) in a delay choice task to evaluate whether they show a magnitude effect when choosing between different quantities {{of the same food}} or when the options are represented by high- and low-preferred foods in different conditions. Whereas food quality did not play a role, we provided the first evidence of an effect of the reward amount on temporal preferences in a non-human primate species, a result with potential implications for the validity of comparative studies on the evolution of delay tolerance. In contrast with human results, but as shown in other animal species, capuchins’ choice of the larger later option decreased as the amount of the smaller sooner option increased. Capuchins based their temporal preferences on the quantity of the smaller <b>sooner</b> option, <b>rather</b> than on that of the larger later option, probably because in the wild they virtually never have to choose between the above two options at the same time, but they more often encounter them consecutively.
