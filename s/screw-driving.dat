50|$|The {{hand tool}} {{used to drive}} in most screws is called a screwdriver. A power tool that does the same job is a power screwdriver; power drills may also be used with <b>screw-driving</b> attachments. Where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical, torque-measuring and torque-limiting {{screwdrivers}} are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw. The hand tool for driving hex head threaded fasteners is a spanner (UK usage) or wrench (US usage), while a nut setter is used with a power screw driver.|$|E
40|$|Achieving human-like {{behavior}} of a robot is a key issue of the paper. Redundancy in the inverse kinematics problem is resolved using a biological analogue. It is shown that by means of 2 ̆ 2 virtual fatigue 2 ̆ 2 functions, {{it is possible to}} generate robot movements similar to movements of a human arm subject to muscle fatigue. Analytic method enabling control of robot motions in a human-like fashion is described. An example of an anthropomorphic robot arm performing a <b>screw-driving</b> task illustrates the method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{observation}} during screw fixing {{activities on}} kitchen cabinet installation was carried out. In collaboration with Signature Kitchen Ptd. Ltd., a kitchen cabinet manufacturer in Malaysia, twenty-eight (28) houses in Kelang Valley, Malaysia {{were selected for}} the study. Almost all of the sites selected have shown some damages of the particleboard during the screw fixing activities. Generally, there were cracks, chip-off or swelling occurred in between the panel surface and the screw head edges. The damages observed on the screw joint during installation are {{in the form of}} split holes, loose holes and delamination. All damages then were identified for its type of failure mode especially at the <b>screw-driving</b> slot and particleboard surface. Six type of failure mode were identified, documented and discussed...|$|E
