5|$|Castle Hill, {{also called}} Mere Castle, was a medieval {{fortification}} built by Richard, the Earl of Cornwall, in 1253 {{on a hill}} overlooking the village of Mere, Wiltshire, England. The castle was constructed in stone, with six towers, inner buildings and gates. It was abandoned in the 14th century and <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> stone and metalwork.

The failure to incite most ranking Solidarity leaders to collaborate, especially Wałęsa's refusal to extend any cooperation along this course of action, resulted in the government adopting the goal of total liquidation of the union movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of a massive companion brings many other possibilities. If Eta Carinae A was rapidly <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> outer layers, {{it might be a}} less massive WC- or WO-type star when core collapse was reached. This would result in a type Ib or type Ic supernova {{due to the lack of}} hydrogen and possibly helium. This supernova type is thought to be the originator of certain classes of gamma ray bursts, but models predict they occur only normally in less massive stars.|$|E

5|$|After the war many castles were slighted, damaged to {{put them}} beyond {{military}} use, but Parliament {{was concerned about the}} threat of a royalist invasion from Scotland and Beaumaris was spared. Colonel John Jones became the castle governor and a garrison was installed inside, at a cost of £1,703 a year. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660 and restored the Bulkeley family as castle constables, Beaumaris appears to have been <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> valuable lead and remaining resources, including the roofs.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{was put on}} hold in August 2015, {{when the}} assets of project {{developer}} Lobsang Dargey were frozen by a court order after a civil fraud suit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC alleges that Dargey diverted funds from the project for his own personal uses, including the purchase of his Bellevue home and gambling. The project was then transferred to a court-appointed receiver and later <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> EB-5 eligibility. In May 2016, the presiding judge approved a plan by two firms to buy out Dargey's share {{of the project and}} restart construction, pending approval from EB-5 investors; in October, the two companies signed an agreement to restart construction and re-brand the project.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, 1997 (a {{day after}} Flores' 35th wedding anniversary), in a {{follow-up}} report on Televisa, a handful of women {{claimed to have been}} sexually abused by Flores approximately twenty years earlier. In a third report on August 17, shortly after the church's most significant holiday, former member Moisés Padilla Íñiguez also accused Flores of sexually abusing him when he was a teenager. These accusations were spearheaded by Erdely's anti-cult group, which demanded that La Luz del Mundo be <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> legal recognition as a religious organization. Four people later filed formal complaints with the state prosecutor, but the statute of limitations for the alleged crimes had passed.|$|E

5|$|Taken together, the {{injuries}} {{appear to be}} a combination of battle wounds, which were the cause of death, followed by post-mortem humiliation wounds inflicted on the corpse. The body wounds show that the corpse had been <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> armour, as the stabbed torso would have been protected by a backplate and the pelvis would have been protected by armour. The wounds were made from behind on the back and buttocks while they were exposed to the elements, consistent with the contemporary descriptions of Richard's naked body being tied across a horse with the legs and arms dangling down on either side. There may have been further flesh wounds not apparent from the bones.|$|E
5|$|The 1885 {{season was}} an annus horribilis for Somerset County Cricket Club. Captained by Edward Sainsbury, {{who had taken}} over from Stephen Newton, captain for the {{previous}} three seasons, they played six first-class cricket matches. Somerset's only win of the season came in their first match; all the other were lost. Two of the losses, those away against Gloucestershire and Surrey, number among the county's ten heaviest defeats. Somerset were unable to field a full team for their fourth match, which coupled with their poor results and lack of fixtures resulted in the club being <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> first-class status {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|The fort's {{armament}} was revised {{several times}} during its seventy years of military usage, as its role evolved in the river's defensive system. It was initially a front-line fortification, supported by Shornemead Fort and Cliffe Fort located {{to the south and}} east respectively on the Kent shore. Over time, as batteries and forts further downriver became the front line of the Thames defences, Coalhouse Fort was <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> main weapons and its fabric was altered to support smaller quick-firing guns intended to be used against fast-moving surface and aerial targets. Its last military usage was as a training facility for a few years after the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Thus {{while other}} European sovereigns were {{building}} luxurious, modern Renaissance and Baroque palaces, politics {{and common sense}} demanded that the palace of the Monegasque rulers be fortified. This unique requirement, at such a late stage in history, has made the palace at Monaco {{one of the most}} unusual in Europe. Indeed, when its fortifications were finally relaxed during the late 18th century, it was seized by the French and <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> treasures, and fell into decline, while the Grimaldi were exiled for over 20 years.|$|E
5|$|When Abdi-Milkutti {{ascended to}} Sidon's throne in 680 BC, he also rebelled against the Assyrians. In response, the Assyrian king Esarhaddon laid siege to the city. Abdi-Milkutti was {{captured}} and beheaded in 677BC after a three-year siege, while his city was destroyed and renamed Kar-Ashur-aha-iddina (the harbor of Esarhaddon). Sidon was <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> territory, which {{was awarded to}} BaalI, the king of rival Tyre and loyal vassal to Esarhaddon. BaalI and Esarhaddon signed a treaty in 675 in which Eshmun's name features {{as one of the}} deities invoked as guarantors of the covenant.|$|E
5|$|When bin Saud took Medina in 1805, Muhammad's tomb was <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> {{gold and}} jewel ornaments. Adherents to Wahhabism, bin Saud's {{followers}} destroyed nearly every tomb dome in Medina {{in order to}} prevent their veneration, and the one of Muhammad is said to have narrowly escaped. Similar events took place in 1925 when the Saudi militias retook—and this time managed to keep—the city. In the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, burial is to take place in unmarked graves. Although frowned upon by the Saudis, many pilgrims continue to practice a ziyarat—a ritual visit—to the tomb.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, there were over 850 monasteries, nunneries and friaries in England. By 1541, there were none. More than 15,000 monks and nuns had been {{dispersed}} and the buildings had been seized by the Crown to be sold off or leased to new lay occupiers. Glastonbury Abbey was reviewed as having significant amounts of silver and gold as well as its attached lands. In September 1539, the abbey was visited by Richard Layton, Richard Pollard and Thomas Moyle, who arrived there without warning on the orders of Thomas Cromwell. The abbey was <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> valuables and Abbot Richard Whiting (Whyting), who had been a signatory to the Act of Supremacy that made Henry VIII the head of the church, resisted and was hanged, drawn and quartered as a traitor on Glastonbury Tor on 15 November 1539.|$|E
5|$|Between July 1 and July 12, 1916, {{five people}} were {{attacked}} {{along the coast}} of New Jersey by sharks; only one of the victims survived. The first major attack occurred on Saturday, July 1 at Beach Haven, a resort town established on Long Beach Island off the southern coast of New Jersey. Charles Epting Vansant, 25, of Philadelphia was on vacation at the Engleside Hotel with his family. Before dinner, Vansant decided to take a quick swim in the Atlantic with a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers believed he was calling to the dog, but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by lifeguard Alexander Ott and bystander Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled the bleeding Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> flesh; he bled to death on the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45p.m.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Morgan was {{promoted}} to brigadier and assumed command of the 1st Support Group of the 1st Armoured Division.

As a result, Morgan's command included only a force of Royal Engineers and a Territorial Army (TA) battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, which {{was in the process of}} converting to an anti-aircraft/anti-tank regiment and armed only with anti-tank guns. His group was in no position to fulfil its normal role supporting the division's armoured brigades and so was sent to reinforce the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division south of the river Somme. During a confused retreat most of the Support Group was captured along with the 51st Division at Saint-Valery-en-Caux but the remainder, including Morgan, got away and were evacuated to England.|$|E
