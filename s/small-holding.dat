In this way, [...] "all were equally provided for; which is the prime care of good Governours in every common-wealth," [...] a system that insures that [...] "the wealth of some might not lead to the oppression of the rest; nor the people change their course, and turn their minds form their innocent labors to any new and strange employment." [...] For Cunaeus, manufacturing and commerce led to moral corruption of all kinds, the collapse of virtuous republican government among them.

40|$|After the {{official}} end of apartheid in South Africa, land reform {{was one of}} the most highly prioritized items on the new ANC government 2 ̆ 7 s agenda, both as a matter of economic restructuring and redressing past injustices. Although numerous land reform programs and initiatives have been implemented since 1994, they have largely failed to reach any of the redistribution goals set forth for them. There is a high rate of failure among land redistribution projects, which are often managed by up to one hundred people. This complicated group management situation is necessitated by the combination of the small grant size available to individual applicants and the high price of agricultural land and implements. In addition, the grants are often contingent upon the participants’ adherence to a large-scale, chemically- and mechanically-intensive farm business model with which they have little, if any, experience. In light of the problems with the current land reform programs in South Africa, I assess the viability of <b>small-hold</b> farming as an alternative to the current focus on large-scale commercial farms using a political ecology framework. As very few <b>small-hold</b> redistribution projects exist, my project focuses on examining one such project in depth. I examine the economic and environmental sustainability of the farm, in addition to the level of satisfaction of the beneficiaries. The assessment of these factors gives an indication of whether land redistribution programs in South Africa could improve their success rates by offering the option of <b>small-hold</b> projects to land grant applicants. It also provides a narrative of the many obstacles encountered in the beneficiaries’ struggle to make a farm of their own—a narrative that reveals many shortcomings in the government’s land redistribution policies and support infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{population growth and}} agricultural! change has been much debated in the academic literature. The existence of seasonal, rural labor shortages as well as untilled land in the densely populated, southern African nation of Malawi is somewhat of a paradox given neo-klalthusian and Boserupian expectations in such a situation. The objective {{of this paper is}} to explore the population and agricultural change dynamics of ~he Malawian <b>small-hold</b> farming sector in relation to the theoretical discourse. The current agrarian situation in Malawi is explained in terms of agricultural and labor policies of colonial and post-colonial governments, local labor dynamics, and the country’s geographical characteristics. The neo-Marxist or poiitical econotny perspective best explains the population and agricultural change interactions in Malawi. This framework’s attention to the colonial legacy, international capitalism and class-based national policies is highly appropriate 10 the Malawian case...|$|R
50|$|Muir makes a complex, Malthusian {{argument}} for the origin of an industrial revolution in New England independent of the English industrial revolution. Demonstrating that the economic model of colonial New England was large families of children on <b>small-hold</b> farms, producing sufficient wealth not only to live comfortably but to enable {{all of the children}} to purchase farms, she argues that a crunch point was reached when cheap, unsettled land ceased to be available. Focusing on the decades following 1790, she argues that families had accumulated wealth to set their children up on farms, but that land was not available until after the federal government broke the armed strength of Tecumseh in the Ohio country. During that twenty-year period, she demonstrates the development of numerous innovative techniques {{in the early stages of}} Interchangeable parts manufacturing and precision tool manufacturing, the aspects of industrialization in which southern New England was to lead the world.|$|R
40|$|Though an {{everyday}} harsh reality {{for more than}} a billion people, the concept of food security has recently entered the mainstream as a result of crises experienced worldwide in 2008. Current production and trade dynamics {{do not seem to be}} aiding the development of a more food secure world, and in the opinion of many, are leading the way into a future of great risk. One of the primary arguments is that the modern, industrial production dynamics are unsustainable environmentally and rely too heavily on technological innovation to solve their woes. Furthermore, it is crowding out a highly undervalued and tradional unit of sustainable production: the <b>small-hold</b> farmer. This is leading to a significant drag on world development, increasing urbanization of the poor and adding to the burden of unemployment in urban areas and causing an important, multi-functional system of agricultural production to be pushed to the margins of society when it should be pushed to the center.

40|$|The {{developing}} world is currently witnessing a great ‘final migration’ of rural to urban. It {{is a necessary}} and inevitable trend, yet failures of urban planning and political consideration result in diminishing opportunities for rural migrants. Activist architecture that attempts {{to deal with these}} problems is often focused on the physical manifestation of the failures of this arrival process: the urban slum. By investigating the rural cause of migration, rather than the urban symptom, this project aims to complement the architectural work being done in cities, reducing the need for migration through the creation of a bottom-up, <b>small-hold,</b> least industrialised collective farm that eases the transition from customary agricultural methods to higher levels of productivity. The project consists of a planning system and an architectural system for designing and building integrative dairy farms that are intended to increase self-reliance, economic opportunities and upward mobility in rural areas while providing for the increasing food demand of the urban environment as it expands. Within the farm, emphasis is placed on the design of the workers living units and lifestyle, to prioritise upskilling and empowerment of lower caste workers. In order to address the scale of the demand in India, this new model is constructed as an adaptable framework to aid management and to provide potential infrastructure upgrades of the local rural area, while containing enough flexibility to suit the specificity of diverse rural communities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to define the impact of {{agriculture}} on African Civilization in the 21 st century. The methodology is based on an interdisciplinary big-picture view of the African Civilizations. The multifaceted layers of civilizations will be analyzed as interdependent with the agricultural development of African societies. Among the findings are: Sub-Saharan Africa falls short of meeting its agricultural needs. Only one of two individual Africans has access to clean and enough water. Energy and supply of electricity are woefully inadequate and unreliable. Agriculture as a foundation for development and modernization for Africa is too limited. Environmental degradation and poor methods of farming make it difficult for African societies to reduce poverty and maintain sustainable environment. Practical implication: In order to develop agriculture as an economic engine, it is critical for African societies to establish and adopt Integrated Infrastructure of Agriculture (IIA). Such a developmental scheme would focus on <b>small-hold</b> farms. This would be made interdependent to a broader scope of developmental task under requisite institutes to be known as the Institute for Agricultural Development (AIAD) and African Food and Agriculture Organization (AFAO). Social implication: Addressing the productive capacity for small farmers and setting in place progressive plans the implementation of modernized agricultural production, processing, and distribution are expressions of a recovering civilization. Originality: The evolution of agriculture in African Civilization will be analyzed from the particular small scale farm to the broad big picture of industrial method of farming and producing in the 21 st century...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on a site}} {{experiment}} on a typical steppe of Inner Mongolia, the short term effects on aboveground biomass, soil water content, soil organic carbon, and soil total nitrogen of four cultivated pastures (CPs) with different compositions of herbaceous species were examined and compared to those of adjacent, natural grassland (NG) enclosed simultaneously. All CPs produced significantly higher aboveground biomass than did the NG {{after two years of}} establishment, and the mixed culture of Agropyron cristatum (A. cristatum) and Medicago sativa (M. sativa) produced the highest (312. 39 % higher than the NG). Without irrigation, soil water content in the 10 – 20 cm soil layer was also found to be significantly higher in the CPs than in the NG, especially for the mixed cultures of A. cristatum and M. sativa, A. cristatum, M. sativa and Lolium perenne (L. perenne), by 184. 25 % and 125. 97 %, respectively. The improvements in soil organic carbon and soil total nitrogen in CPs were less obvious and mixed, with different species compositions showing significant increases at different depths. The experimental results suggested that, with carefully selected species compositions and proper farming measures, CPs could {{have a positive effect on}} some of the pathways that generate ecosystem services, at least in the short term. We also analyzed the underlying institutional and socioeconomic causes of China’s underdevelopment of CPs, and proposed a two-step development strategy. The first is to promote rain-fed CPs on <b>small-hold</b> farms, which require relatively low inputs in fertilizers and labor. The second is to promote large-scale operations, which will require significantly more inputs in land, irrigation, fertilizers, and machinery...|$|R

50|$|Far from improving, the {{conditions}} faced by Oklahoma's <b>small-holding</b> and tenant farmers remained abysmal {{into the first}} years of the 20th Century. Farmers continued to suffer greatly unfavorable terms for credit or rent while receiving extremely low prices for the cotton, corn, and wheat which they produced. Southern agriculture was the hardest hit in the nation, and the regional blight which plagued the cotton economy impacted even the Southwestern state of Oklahoma. By 1910 half the farmers of the South worked on land which they did not own, with between one-quarter and one-half of their annual production lost off the top to rent. The average income of such farmers in Oklahoma was estimated in one contemporary study at just $200 per year.|$|E

Bill Stuart, headmaster at the school, recalled that sewage would run down Van Buuren Road from Malvern East and that the piggeries and other farms caused swarms of flies. There was talk that the area should become part of a municipality {{in order to deal with}} the matter, and residents were asked whether they would prefer to join Johannesburg or Germiston. Joining a municipality would mean rates and taxes though, so the residents elected instead to set up a health committee to sort out the problem.

50|$|The party's {{program was}} both {{democratic}} socialist and agrarian socialist in nature; it garnered much support among Russia's rural peasantry, who in particular supported their program of land-socialization {{as opposed to}} the Bolshevik program of land-nationalization—division of land to peasant tenants rather than collectivization in state management. Their policy platform differed from that of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Parties — both Bolshevik and Menshevik — in that it was not officially Marxist (though some of its ideologues considered themselves such); the SRs believed that the 'laboring peasantry', as well as the industrial proletariat, would be the revolutionary class in Russia. Whereas Russian SDs defined class membership in terms of ownership of the means of production, Chernov and other SR theorists defined class membership in terms of extraction of surplus value from labor. On the first definition, <b>small-holding</b> subsistence farmers who do not employ wage labor are, as owners of their land, members of the petty bourgeoisie; on the second definition, they can be grouped with all who provide, rather than purchase, labor-power, and hence with the proletariat as part of the 'laboring class'. Chernov nevertheless considered the proletariat the 'vanguard', with the peasantry forming the 'main body' of the revolutionary army.|$|E
