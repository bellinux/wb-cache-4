Naturally, other safety details have also been carefully worked out, not least fire safety, {{with the use of}} non-inflammable and <b>self-extinguishing</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractAddition of {{wood flour}} improve the {{mechanical}} properties of thermoplastics, {{on the other}} hand it increases the burning speed of the materials. To modify the flammability of wood-plastic composites(WPC), various fire retardants, such as ammonium polysphosphate (APP), melamine polyphosphate (MPP) and aluminum hydroxide were added to WPCs. Burning tests based on UL 94 and cone calorimetry were conducted to evaluate a fire performance of WPCs with fire retardants. The addition of fire retardants could lead to <b>self-extinguishing</b> <b>materials</b> when 10 wt% of APP was used. However, in the case of pure polypropylene, addition of 10 wt% of APP did not improve the flammability. Wood flour accelerates the burning behavior of PP, but it can reduce the use of APP to achieve <b>self-extinguishing</b> <b>materials.</b> Synergy effects between wood flour and APP was confirmed. Wood flour facilitates the forming of foamed char layer by APP during the combustion. This protective char surface can reduce the heat and oxygen diffusion toward the WPCs. The effect of fire retardants of mechanical properties of WPCs was also investigated. Tensile strength and modulus of composites decreased with addition of fire retardants...|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{the effect}} of diammoniumphosphate (DAP) as fire {{retardant}} additive during thermal degradation of wood samples from shorea obtuse (Dipterocarpaceae) has been investigated. Thermal properties of wood samples impregnated with DAP ranging from 0 - 40 %wt were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and limiting oxygen index (LOI). Leachability of DAP from impregnated samples kept under running water was also investigated. The {{results indicated that the}} rate of weight loss obtained from TGA reveal that impregnation of DAP reduced the degradation rate from 0. 95 %/oC to 0. 56 %/oC. Furthermore, LOI of woods specimens trended to be increase from 24. 8 to 30. 6 when they were treated with DAP having a range of 0 - 30 %wt. Based on the results of this study, wood samples impregnated with 30 %wt of DAP can be classified as <b>self-extinguishing</b> <b>materials</b> and cloud meet the requirement for non-flammability in construction. The leachability test indicated that only trace amount of unreacted DAP leached from the samples...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrated}} that self-extinguishing polymer nanocomposites, which can pass the stringent UL 94 V 0 standard, can be successfully prepared by combining modified organoclays with traditional flame retardant (FR) agents. Using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM), we determined that the addition of modified clays, which can intercalate or exfoliate in the matrix, also improved the dispersion of the FR agents. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) indicated that the clays increased the modulus of the polymer above Tg, which prevented dripping during burning. Cone calorimetry test showed that the nanocomposites with both FR and organoclay, had a lower peak heat release rate (PHRR) and average mass loss rate (MLR) than those with only clay or the FR agents. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data confirmed that no FR/clay interactions occurred in the solid phase, and that the synergistic effects were due to gas phase reactions. Since this mechanism is not specific, it opens the possibility of formulating <b>self-extinguishing</b> <b>materials</b> from a large class of polymers...|$|R
5000|$|Fluoroelastomer (FKM): {{noted for}} their very high {{resistance}} to heat and {{a wide variety of}} chemicals. Other key benefits include excellent resistance to aging and ozone, very low gas permeability {{and the fact that the}} <b>materials</b> are <b>self-extinguishing.</b> Standard FKM <b>materials</b> have excellent resistance to mineral oils and greases, aliphatic, aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons, fuels, non-flammable hydraulic fluids (HFD) and many organic solvents and chemicals. Generally not resistant to hot water, steam, polar solvents, glycol-based brake fluids and low molecular weight organic acids. In addition to the standard FKM materials, a number of specialty materials with different monomer compositions and fluorine content (65% to 71%) are available that offer improved chemical or temperature resistance and/or better low temperature performance.|$|R
40|$|A {{test program}} was {{performed}} to determine the highest pressure in oxygen where materials used in the planned NASA Constellation Program Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Crew Module (CM) would not propagate a flame if an ignition source was present. The test methodology used {{was similar to that}} previously used to determine the maximum oxygen concentration (MOC) at which self-extinguishment occurs under constant total pressure conditions. An upward limiting pressure index (ULPI) was determined, where approximately 50 percent of the <b>materials</b> <b>self-extinguish</b> in a given environment. Following this, the maximum total pressure (MTP) was identified; where all samples tested (at least five) self-extinguished following the NASA-STD- 6001. A Test 1 burn length criteria. The results obtained on seven materials indicate that the non-metallic materials become flammable in oxygen between 0. 4 and 0. 9 psia...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} approach {{consisted of}} concentrating the {{testing in the}} flammability transition zone following the Bruceton Up-and-Down Method. For attribute data, the method {{has been shown to}} be very repeatable and most efficient. Other methods for characterization of critical levels (Karberand Probit) were also considered. The data yielded the upward limiting pressure index (ULPI), the pressure level where approx. 50 % of <b>materials</b> <b>self-extinguish</b> in a given environment. Parametric flammability thresholds other than oxygen concentration can be determined with the methodology proposed for evaluating the MOC when extinguishment occurs. In this case, a pressure threshold in 99. 8 % oxygen was determined with the methodology and found to be 0. 4 to 0. 9 psia for typical spacecraft materials. Correlation of flammability thresholds obtained with chemical, hot wire, and other ignition sources will be conducted to provide recommendations for using alternate ignition sources to evaluate flammability of aerospace materials...|$|R
40|$|The average burn {{rates of}} several {{metals and alloys}} were {{determined}} at oxygen pressures between 3. 45 and 68. 91 MPa (500 and 10, 000 psig) and ambient temperature. Several materials were tested at elevated sample temperatures. The test materials were fabricated into solid cylindrical rods and mounted vertically in the test chamber. A magnesium igniter was positioned at the bottom end of each test specimen to promote upward burn propagations. Nickel 200 and copper 102 could not be ignited at all oxygen pressures tested whereas Monel 400 appeared to ignite but quickly <b>self-extinguished.</b> The other <b>materials</b> tested burned {{the entire length of}} the test sample. Aluminum 6061 exhibited the fastest burn propagation rate. Inconel 718 burned slower than aluminum but faster than the stainless steels (types 304 and 316). Increasing oxygen pressure generally increased the burn propagation rate of the materials. Increasing the ambient temperature of the test specimens for several materials to approximately 850 K (1070 F) had little effect upon the ignition or burn properties of nickel 200 or Monel 400. Type 316 stainless steel exhibited an increase in its burn propagation rate at this higher temperature...|$|R
5000|$|In Shakesperean theater, {{red wine}} {{was used in}} a glass {{container}} as a light filter. In later days, colored water or silk was used to filter light in the theater. Later, a gelatin base became the material of choice. Gelatin gel was available at least until 1979. The name gel has continued {{to be used to}} the present day. Gelatin based color media had no melting point, and the color was cast in the media as opposed to being coated on the surface, both important properties for color media. It would, however, char at high temperature and became brittle once heated, so it was impossible to handle once used in the lighting instrument. By 1945 more heat-tolerant <b>self-extinguishing</b> acetate-based through-dyed <b>materials</b> were being manufactured (marketed as Chromoid then Cinemoid by Strand Electric). In the States Roscolene (acetate) was also developed to deal with these higher output light sources. Though cheaper, the acetate filters fell out of favor with professional organizations since they could not withstand the higher temperatures produced by the 'tungsten halogen lamps' that came into widespread use in the late 1960s. The acetate-based material was replaced by polycarbonates like Roscolar (mylar polycarbonate) and polyester based filters. These materials have superior heat tolerance when compared to acetate-based gels. Many were transparent film with a surface coating. The first dyed polyester [...] "gels" [...] were introduced by Berkey-Colortran in 1969 as Gelatran, the original deep dyed polyester. The Gelatran process is still used today to produce GAMColor (100% of the line) and Roscolux (apx. 30% of the line). Other color manufacturers, such as Lee Filters and Apollo Design Technology use a surface applied dye. (Roscolux is 70% polycarbonate and 30% deep dyed polyester.) Almost every color manufacturer today uses either polycarbonate or polyester to manufacture their [...] "gels". Even today's gels can burn out (to lighten in color starting in the center) easily, rendering them useless. To help combat this, a high temperature (HT) material (polyester having the highest melting point 480 °F (250 °C)), can be used to help prolong the life in high-heat output lighting instruments. As instrument design improves, it has become a selling point on many lights to have as little heat radiating {{from the front of the}} fixture as possible to help prevent burn-through, and help keep the stage and actors cooler during performances.|$|R
