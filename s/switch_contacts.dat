This caused arcing across <b>switch</b> <b>contacts</b> and rapid contact fouling and failure. As electronics were gradually implemented in pinball design, solenoids began to be switched by power transistors under software control to lower switch voltage and current, vastly extend switch service lifetime, and add flexibility to game design.|$|E

2500|$|With {{automated}} starters such as glow starters, {{a failing}} tube will cycle endlessly, flickering as the lamp quickly goes out because the emission mix {{is insufficient to}} keep the lamp current high {{enough to keep the}} glow starter open. This runs the ballast at higher temperature. Some more advanced starters time out in this situation, and do not attempt repeated starts until power is reset. Some older systems used a thermal over-current trip to detect repeated starting attempts and disable the circuit until manually reset. [...] The <b>switch</b> <b>contacts</b> in glow starters are subject to wear and inevitably fail eventually, so the starter is manufactured as a plug-in replaceable unit.|$|E
2500|$|Snubbers are energy-absorbing {{circuits}} used {{to eliminate}} voltage spikes caused by circuit inductance when a switch opens. The {{purpose of the}} snubber is to improve electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) by eliminating the voltage transient that occurs when a switch abruptly opens, or by suppressing sparking of <b>switch</b> <b>contacts</b> (such as an automotive ignition coil with mechanical interrupter), or by limiting the voltage slew rate of semiconductor switches like thyristors, GTO thyristors, IGBTs and bipolar transistors. Snubber capacitors (or higher power [...] "damping capacitors") require a very low self-inductance and very low ESR capacitor construction. [...] These devices are also expected to be highly reliable because, if the snubber RC circuitry fails, a power semiconductor will be destroyed in most cases.|$|E

The plasma is also very hot and is capable of eroding the metal surfaces of the <b>switch</b> <b>contacts.</b> Electric current arcing causes significant degradation of the contacts and also significant electromagnetic interference (EMI), requiring the use of arc suppression methods.|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{presents}} a randomized manipulation planner for a multi-fingered hand by <b>switching</b> <b>contact</b> modes. Manipulation planning {{for such a}} system should consider changing kinematics and dynamics of the system according to the contact modes. We derive the conditions that would be satisfied in manipulation planning, based on the kinematical properties of a manipulation system. The conditions allow the planner to assign more contact modes than those corresponding to the relative motion of contact points restricted by constraint forces. Consequently, this enables dextrous manipulation. In addition, the conditions give the restrictions of feasible contact modes {{and the number of}} contact points. Inspired by randomized motion planning techniques, we propose a new algorithm for manipulation planning in order to explore object configuration space, SE(3), rapidly and uniformly. The basis for this approach is for the construction of exploring random trees. Simulation examples for 3 -D manipulation by <b>switching</b> <b>contact</b> modes are presented to verify the plannerâ€™s effectiveness. I...|$|R
