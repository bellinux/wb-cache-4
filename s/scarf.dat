50|$|Many {{surface defects}} can be <b>scarfed</b> {{off the surface}} of {{semi-finished}} rolled products before further rolling. Methods of <b>scarfing</b> have included hand-chipping with chisels (18th and 19th centuries); powered chipping and grinding with air chisels and grinders; burning with an oxy-fuel torch, whose gas pressure blows away the metal or slag melted by the flame; and laser <b>scarfing.</b>|$|R
40|$|A new flow {{analysis}} paradigm and a novel technique to enhance <b>scarfed</b> nozzle thrust are presented. The new paradigm, the space-time Conservation Element and Solution Element (CESE) method, a truly unsteady and genuinely multi-dimensional flow solver that provides accurate solutions for Euler and Navier-Stokes flows, {{is well suited}} for next generation flow analyses. In this study, the space-time CESE method was applied to solve <b>scarfed</b> nozzles flow-fields. Nozzle <b>scarfing</b> is frequently used for vectoring control of a space propulsion sub-system; it reduces nozzle weight and length and lowers nozzle thrust. A novel technique to enhance <b>scarfed</b> nozzles' thrust is discussed and investigated. Results of 2 D and 3 D flow analyses are presented...|$|R
40|$|The <b>scarfing</b> {{processing}} {{experiment was}} carried out for a steel slab moving at a constant speed with the <b>scarfing</b> torch fixed. The temperature histories inside the slab were recorded by two sets of thermocouples in different depths. A two-step computational model of heat transfer in <b>scarfing</b> processing has been developed in FLUENT. The model features in detail heat conduction from both the hot slag coating and the <b>scarfing</b> reaction to the steel slab surface, and it solves for steady state heat advection in the Step- 1 model followed by the Step- 2 model of transient heat transfer calculation. The combination of these two steps is able to give the complete prediction of a temperature history of 122. 2 sec. The temperature predictions agree well with the experimental measurements. The high temperature region (1100 oC ~ 1500 oC) {{is found to be}} mainly located in a depth of 0. 5 mm near the slab surface. The fraction of heat conducted from the hot slag coating into the slab is 5. 4 % while that from the <b>scarfing</b> reaction is 10. 3 %. The simulations clearly explain the measurements and suggest practical implications. Section II. Background <b>Scarfing</b> processing has been used widely to remove surface defects from steel and other semi-finished as-cast products for over 70 years. The first automated <b>scarfing</b> machine used in production was built and installed in 1935. Steel slabs produced from continuous casting often exhibit surface defects, including inclusions, pits and cracks, such as shown in Fig. 1. In order to obtain advanced high strength steels (AHSS) for automotive parts or other high-quality-products, these surface defects should be avoided during the casting process or removed during post-processing using the <b>scarfing</b> technique...|$|R

5|$|They {{eventually}} meet up {{with the}} Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), {{who is trying to}} outrun giant monsters made up of morphed-together penguins. Finn and Jake then see their father, Joshua, knitting a <b>scarf.</b> The <b>scarf</b> turns into the King Worm, and the duo give chase. On the top of a mountain, they find the worm frozen, and Finn manages to shatter it, seemingly waking the two from their dream state. However, Finn soon discovers that he is still dreaming and that Jake was not actually with him, but rather another figment of the dream. The King Worm actually presents himself and taunts Finn. Finn, however, unleashes his subconscious fears, and the emotional trauma begins to destroy the dreamscape, weakening King Worm's hold. Eventually, the fears become so powerful that the King Worm is defeated, and Finn wakes up in the real world. He and Jake promptly evicted the King Worm from their house.|$|E

Kenshin's hair is tied in two tails, which are flowing {{to make him look}} younger, and shorter, and less androgynous. Watsuki also added a Habaki to Kenshin's sword {{to make it easier to}} draw by simplifying its structure, while also emphasizing strength. Kenshin's hitokiri look was also redesigned slightly, by making his clothes more worn and giving him Yukishiro Tomoe's neck <b>scarf.</b>|$|E
