50|$|Where {{high-volume}} {{production runs}} of panels are required, the wheel {{is replaced by}} a <b>stamping</b> <b>press</b> that has a much higher capital setup cost and longer development time than using an English wheel, but each panel in the production run can be produced in a matter of seconds. This cost is defrayed across a larger production run, but a <b>stamping</b> <b>press</b> is limited to only one model of panel per set of dies. The English wheel model shown is manually operated, but when used on thicker sheet metals such as for ship hulls the machine may be powered and much larger than the one shown here.|$|E
50|$|Stamping (also {{known as}} pressing) {{is the process}} of placing flat sheet metal in either blank or coil form into a <b>stamping</b> <b>press</b> where a tool and die surface forms the metal into a net shape. Stamping {{includes}} a variety of sheet-metal forming manufacturing processes, such as punching using a machine press or <b>stamping</b> <b>press,</b> blanking, embossing, bending, flanging, and coining. This could be a single stage operation where every stroke of the press produces the desired form on the sheet metal part, or could occur through a series of stages. The process is usually carried out on sheet metal, but can also be used on other materials, such as polystyrene.|$|E

50|$|An {{aspect of}} the all-steel car bodies that became {{mainstream}} among the larger European automakers in the 1930s was the very high initial cost associated with the heavy steel presses and the dies needed to cut and <b>stamp</b> <b>pressed</b> steel sheeting into the panels that, when welded together, would form a sufficiently rigid and robust car body. The wide range of car bodies was therefore carefully devised to maximise the sharing of panels between the different body variants listed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{feasibility}} of hot <b>stamping</b> and <b>press</b> quenching of ultra{{high strength steel}} sheet using resistance heating was investigated by demonstrating experiments. In the experiments, a rectangular blank of high strength steel sheet, SPFC 980 Y, 1. 2 mm thick, 20 mm wide and 130 mm long was used and it was resistance-heated {{with a pair of}} parallel electrodes placed 120 mm away from each other, using an AC power supply with a function of input energy control. The relationship between input energy and heating temperature was examined and then hot <b>stamping</b> and <b>press</b> quenching performances were examined. The press quenching was also experimented in hot hat-shaped bending, and the influences of the heating temperature on spring-back and hardness property were investigated. The results of the experiments revealed that hot <b>stamping</b> and <b>press</b> quenching using resistance heating are highly feasible...|$|R

Its introduction marks perfect timing of the plant's Realpolitik to {{the political and economic}} reality of the early 1990s. The development of successors to the 24s derivatives, both the 24-10 and 3102, the 3103/3104/3105 family was experiencing delays, and {{it was clear that the}} mass-produced 3103 and 3104 series would not come about for a few years to come.

50|$|A tonnage monitor is a meter {{used on a}} <b>stamping</b> <b>press</b> {{to measure}} the force applied by the ram. In a press, the cutting and forming tools in the die will wear down, {{requiring}} increasing effort to stamp the part. A tonnage monitor allows the user to observe this degradation and decide {{when it is time}} to sharpen and adjust the die. It generally uses strain gauges attached to the frame or tie rods of the press. The gauges provide an electric signal by means of piezoelectric effect as they are stretched during press operation.|$|E
50|$|Detonography is {{a method}} for {{sculpting}} metal with plastic or other explosives. Essentially a form of giant printmaking, with the explosive acting as the <b>stamping</b> <b>press,</b> it was created by Evelyn Rosenberg in 1986 {{with the help of}} the engineers of New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, New Mexico. The process can create complex surfaces with delicate etched designs, even welding dissimilar metals. The results are lightweight, durable indoor and out, and relatively vandalproof. This process essentially embosses the metal, but with a raised image instead of a depressed one.|$|E
