40|$|We {{will now}} {{summarize}} the conclusions from parts I, II and III of this study. A test procedure {{has been developed}} that provides a simple, quick, and nondestructive means of monitoring the in vitro growth of S mutans {{in the presence of}} amalgams and alloys. The spectrophotometric readings are related in a simple way to growth expressed as dry weight of bacteria and metabolic products. Results are expressed as growth relative to controls which represent bacteria growing under identical conditions but not in contact with metals. The %RA 60 value that represents growth after 60 hours relative to controls is used as a measure of growth in the presence of alloys or amalgams. Spherical, fine cut, and dispersion alloys were studied as well as amalgams prepared from these alloys. The dispersion alloy inhibits growth less than the <b>spherical</b> <b>alloy</b> which in turn inhibits growth less than the fine cut alloy. The results for amalgams prepared from the alloys are reversed. At an aging time of two hours, dispersion alloy amalgams inhibit growth more than <b>spherical</b> <b>alloy</b> amalgams and fine cut alloy amalgams. Aging time of amalgams greatly influences the growth inhibition. Immediately after trituration growth is inhibited, but this inhibition is lost with aging. Different types of amalgams seem to lose growth inhibition at different rates. Hg composition in the range of 48 to 52 % seems to have little effect on growth inhibition. It remains for clinical studies, which are concerned with the incidence of secondary caries associated with amalgams, to demonstrate that the age and nature of the amalgam are significant...|$|E

This study sought to enhance the compressive strength and setting time of a PC by adding {{one of the following}} additives: 20 % and 30 % poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA), 20 % and 30 % irregular and spherical amalgam alloys, and 10 % CaCl 2. The control consisted of unreinforced PC specimens. Setting time was determined using a Gillmore apparatus according to standardized methods while compressive strength was measured using a universal testing machine after 21 hours or 60 days of water storage. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey and Games-Howell tests (&# 945; = 5 %). All additives significantly decreased both initial and final setting times as compared with the PC-control (p <. 05). 30 % PMMA and 30 % irregular alloy had the lowest values of initial setting time. 30 % irregular alloy also produced the lowest values of final setting time while 30 % <b>spherical</b> <b>alloy</b> yielded the highest (p <. 05). No differences were detected between the compressive strength values of 21 hours and 60 days. While 10 % CaCl 2, 20 % and 30 % PMMA produced values significantly lower than the PC-control, 30 % <b>spherical</b> <b>alloy</b> significantly improved the compressive strength of the reinforced PC (p <. 05). In summary, all additives significantly reduced the setting time and 30 % spherical amalgam alloy yielded a significant increase in compressive strength for the tested PC, which might represent an improved composition for PCs to expand their use as endodontic and potentially load bearing materials...|$|E

The influence of alloy particle size on the prop-erties of dental amalgam has been recognized {{for a number of}} years. 1 ' 2 It has also been shown that the strength of the material {{is a function of the}} packing pressure. 3 ' 4 Some investiga-ors 5 - 7 have reported the effects of packing pressure on the compressive and tensile strengths of amalgam.

Although numer-ous studies have shown that the compressive and tensile strengths and dimensional changes in setting, flow, and mercury content are modi-fied by different packing pressures, to the author's knowledge, no study has been made of its effect on the abrasion resistance of dental amalgam. Since it appeared that other mechanical properties of a <b>spherical</b> <b>alloy</b> amalgam were less sensitive to a reduction in packing pres-sure than amalgams made from conventional dental alloy, it was decided to undertake an abrasion test.

The AuPt heteroaggregate, AuPt <b>alloy</b> <b>spherical</b> nanoparticles, and AuPt alloy nanowires were prepared by a sequential or co-reduction method. The unique AuPt heteroaggregate nanostructures, synthesized by the sequential reduction method, contain Au cores with Pt tendrils {{extending from the}} Au surfaces. The AuPt alloy nanoparticles or nanowires were prepared by the rapid co-reduction method. This rapid co-reduction method prevents the phase separation and traps the metastable AuPt alloy phase. The AuPt heteroaggregate, <b>alloy</b> <b>spherical</b> nanoparticles, <b>alloy</b> nanowires, and the reported Au@Pt core-shell structures, constitute the rare example of a bimetallic system containing all reported architectures in the literature. Kinetically stabilized Cu@Pt core-shell nanoparticles were prepared by deposition of Pt onto Cu nanoparticles. The Cu@Pt particles exhibit high stability toward alloying upon annealing. In contrast, the Pt@Cu particles readily transform into alloy structures in the same conditions. This abnormal stability of the Cu@Pt particles is attributed to the Kirkendall mass transport effect, where the inherent diffusion direction from the Pt to Cu is hindered by a limited population of vacancies in the Cu cores. These architecturally controlled bimetallic nanomaterials were applied in CO tolerant hydrogen oxidation and de-NOx reactions with hydrogen. In the H 2 /CO/O 2 fuel, the AuPt alloy nanoparticles are CO tolerant in hydrogen oxidation, and the AuPt heteroaggregate nanoparticles exhibit enhanced preferential CO oxidation {{in the presence of}} Fe promoters. In the NO/H 2 reaction, the Cu@Pt nanoparticles maintain the high activity of pure Pt particles and have a higher selectivity for N 2.

They were condensed in cylindrical cavities following three techniques: manual (Ward # 2), mechanical (Densco-Teledyne) and piezoelectric ultrasonic (Gnatus). Procedures were performed inside an acrylic box (50 x 50 x 35 cm, or 0. 0875 m 3) with an exhaustion pump (6 l/min). The level of mercury vapor was monitored during 15 min after trituration.

Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the surface effects of aluminum trihydroxide airpolishing powder on a series of restorative materials. Materials and Methods: A total of 6 Class V preparations with enamel margins were created on the buccal surface of extracted human molars. The preparations were restored with Type III gold, a high copper <b>spherical</b> <b>alloy</b> amalgam, porcelain, a lightactivated hybrid composite material, a light-activated microfilled composite material, and a light-activated, resin-modified glass ionomer material. The distal half of each restoration was covered with fiberglass tape and the mesial half subjected to treatment with the aluminum trihydroxide powder via the Prophy-Jet™ for 5 seconds. After removal of the protective tape, the buccal surface of each treated tooth was replicated with impression material. Replicas were generated using epoxy resin and prepared for evaluation with scanning electron microscopy. Results: The aluminum trihydroxide produced surface alterations that were apparent visually and when viewed by a scanning microscope of the hybrid and microfilled composites and the glass ionomer restorations. The surfaces of the amalgam and gold restorations were altered, but not to the extent that the resin-based materials were. No disruption of the surface characterization of the porcelain was detected; however, with gold and porcelain materials, the aluminum trihydroxide removed notable amounts of the luting cements (the results are consistent with the data gathered with sodium bicarbonate powder).

This remarkable strengthening was achieved without precipitation hardening and without severe strain hardening during consolidation because of the matrix choice (elemental Al) and the ''low shear'' consolidation methods utilized. This reinforcement effectiveness is further evidenced by elastic modulus measurements of the composites that are very close to the upper bound predictions of the rule of mixtures. The load partitioning measurements by neutron diffraction showed that composite samples made from GARS powders present significantly higher load transfer efficiency than the composites made from commercially atomized powders. Also, the composite samples made from GARS powders show a higher strengthening effect and ductility than the samples made from commercial purity powders. The higher load transfer efficiency and higher strength and ductility may result from an enhanced inter-particle bonding strength, promoted by the ''clean'' interfaces between particles. Further analysis of the load sharing measurements and the calculated values of the mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and the geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) effects suggest that these strengthening mechanisms can be combined to predict accurately the strength of the composites...|$|R

Although reasonable densification was achieved at low sintering temperatures (93 – 96 % relative density) the samples had poor mechanical properties due mainly to the presence of the macroporosity and the high inherent oxygen content in the as-received fine powders...|$|R

Phase constituents, microstructure and surface state of the powder, and pore characteristics of the resulting porous alloy were investigated. The {{results show that the}} undissolved W and V in the mechanically alloyed powder is fully alloyed after spheroidization, and single Î² phase is achieved. Particle size of the spheroidized powder is in the range of 20 â 110 Â Î¼m. With the decrease of particle size, a transformation from typical dendrite solidification structure to fine cell microstructure occurs. The surface of the spheroidized powder is coated by a layer of oxides consisting mainly of TiO 2 and Nb 2 O 5. Probabilities of sinter-neck formation and particle coalescence increases with increasing sintering temperature. Porous skeleton with relatively homogeneous pore distribution and open pore channel is formed after vacuum sintering at 1700 Â Â°C, and the porosity is 32 %. The sintering kinetic analysis indicates that grain boundary diffusion is the primary mass transport mechanism during sintering process.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{deposition}} of intermetallic thin films by laser ablation deposition (LAD) and their characterization. Pulsed laser ablation and subsequent deposition of the ablated vapours produces films under conditions very far away from equilibrium. Besides the film, which forms directly by quenching the vapour or plasma on substrate, one also obtains under certain conditions micron and sub-micron sized <b>spherical</b> droplets of <b>alloy</b> melt on to the film. The latter travel at very high velocities and impinge on the substrate resulting in a very high rate of heat transfer during solidification from liquid state. Therefore, in this work it was possible to study the microstructure evolution depending on quenching rates of different sized droplets and compare with the extreme case of vapour/plasma quenching. The compositions selected correspond to the intermetallic compounds in Al-Fe, Al-Ni and Ti-Si binary systems. Pre-alloyed targets of the appropriate intermetallic compositions were used for ablation by laser. The deposition system has been designed and built in-house. The characterization is mainly done by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The study focuses on microstructure and phase evolution within these intermetallic films at room temperature, at elevated temperature and during heating the room temperature deposited films in heating stage inside the TEM...|$|R
