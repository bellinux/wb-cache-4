While models like Fitts’ law make general predictions, there is little research on how efficiency varies under different conditions like in which <b>screen</b> <b>region</b> a movement starts and in which direction it is going, and whether the surface is horizontal or vertical. This study investigates these aspects with regard to translation movements on a touch screen, using an extended Fitts’ law setup and considering arm kinematics. The results show that on horizontal displays translation is faster and causes less arm fatigue than on vertical ones. Also, on horizontal displays, we identified screen regions and movement directions that allow significantly faster movement compared to others. Finally, movements that employ shorter kinematic chains (e. g. just the wrist) are significantly faster than those that use longer ones (e. g. wrist, elbow, shoulder). We suggest adjustments to Fitts’ original formulation. In the future, our findings can inform or partially automate positioning decisions in interaction design...|$|E

The voxel data is converted to a polygonal surface using a “marchingcubes” algorithm; since the modifications to the voxel data are local, we accelerate this computation by an incremental algorithm and accelerate the display by using a special data structure for determining which polygons must be redrawn in a particular <b>screen</b> <b>region.</b> We provide a variety of tools: one that cuts away material, one that adds material, a “sandpaper ” tool, a “heat gun, ” etc. The technique provides an intuitive direct interaction, as if the user were working with clay or wax.

By analyzing the image content of the tracked <b>screen</b> <b>region,</b> our system is able to detect slide progressions and extract a high-quality, non-occluded, geometrically-compensated image for each slide, resulting in a list of representative images that reconstruct the main presentation structure.

The first, Visual Screen, uses {{an inexpensive}} technique to transform an ordinary screen into a touch screen using an ordinary camera. The setup is easy: position a camera {{so it can}} see the whole screen. The system calibration involves the detection of the <b>screen</b> <b>region</b> in the image, which determines the projective mapping between the image plane and the screen. In runtime, our system locates the tip pointer (fingertip in our current implementation) in the image and converts the image position to the cursor position on the screen. The second system, Visual Panel, extends the previous system for mobile applications. It employs an arbitrary quadrangle-shaped panel (e. g., an ordinary piece of paper) and a tip pointer as an intuitive, wireless and mobile input device. The system can accurately and reliably track the panel and the tip pointer. The panel tracking continuously determines the projective mapping between the panel at the current position and the display, which in turn maps the tip position to the corresponding position on the display. The system can fulfill many tasks such as controlling a remote large display, and simulating a physical keyboard...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe thin-client {{computing}} {{model has}} been recently regaining popularity in a new form known as the virtual desktop. That is where the desktop is hosted on a virtualized platform. Even though the interest in this computing paradigm is broad there are relatively few tools and methods for benchmarking virtual client infrastructures. We believe that developing such tools and approaches is crucial for the future success of virtual client deployments and also for objective evaluation of existing and new algorithms, communication protocols, and technologies. We present DeskBench, a virtual desktop benchmarking tool, that allows for fast and easy creation of benchmarks by simple recording of the user's activity. It also allows for replaying the recorded actions in a synchronized manner at maximum possible speeds without compromising the correctness of the replay. The proposed approach relies only on the basic primitives of mouse and keyboard events as well as <b>screen</b> <b>region</b> updates which are common in window manager systems.

40|$|Global {{illumination}} dramatically improves realistic {{appearance of}} rendered scenes, but usually it is neglected in VR systems {{due to its}} high costs. In this work we present an efficient global illumination solution specifically tailored for those CAVE applications, which require an immediate response for dynamic light changes and allow for free motion of the observer, but involve scenes with static geometry. As an application example we choose the car interior modeling under free driving conditions. We illuminate the car using dynamically changing High Dynamic Range (HDR) environment maps and use the Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) method for the global illumination computation. We leverage the PRT method to handle scenes with non-trivial topology represented by complex meshes. Also, we propose a hybrid of PRT and final gathering approach for high-quality rendering of objects with complex Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). We use this method for predictive rendering of the navigation LCD panel based on its measured BRDF. Since the global illumination computation leads to HDR images we propose a tone mapping algorithm tailored specifically for the CAVE. We employ head tracking to identify the observed <b>screen</b> <b>region</b> and derive for it proper luminance adaptation conditions, which are then used for tone mapping on all walls in the CAVE.

Move the mouse left or right, and you can resize the region horizontally while holding the vertical size fixed. • Option: Press and hold Option while dragging your region, and you’ll change the way the region grows as you drag.

40|$|We use {{a simple}} two-layer outer gap model, whose {{accelerator}} {{consists of a}} primary <b>region</b> and a <b>screening</b> <b>region,</b> to discuss the γ-ray spectrum of mature pulsars detected by Fermi. By solving the Poisson equation with an assumed simple step-function distribution for the charge density in these two regions, {{the distribution of the}} electric field and the curvature radiation process of the accelerated particles can be calculated. In our model, the properties of the phase-averaged spectrum can be completely specified by three gap parameters, i. e., the fractional gap size in the outer magnetosphere, the gap current in the primary region, and the gap size ratio between the primary region and the total gap size. We discuss how these parameters affect the spectral properties. We argue that although the radiation mechanism in the outer gap is a curvature radiation process, the observed gamma-ray spectrum can substantially deviate from the simple curvature spectrum because the overall spectrum consists of two components, i. e., a primary <b>region</b> and a <b>screening</b> <b>region.</b> In some pulsars, the radiation from the <b>screening</b> <b>region</b> is so strong that the photon index from 100 MeV to several GeV can be as flat as ∼ 2. We show that the fitting fractional gap thickness of the canonical pulsars increases with the spin-down age. We find that the total gap current is about 50 % of the Goldreich-Julian value and the thickness of the <b>screening</b> <b>region</b> is a few percent of the total gap thickness. We also find that the predicted γ-ray luminosity is less dependent on the spin-down power (L sd) for pulsars with L sd ≳ 10 36 erg s - 1, while the γ-ray luminosity decreases with the spin-down power for pulsars with L sd ≲ 10 36 erg s - 1. This relation may imply that the major gap closure mechanism is a photon-photon pair-creation process for pulsars with L sd ≳ 10 36 erg s - 1, while it is a magnetic pair-creation process for pulsars with L sd ≲ 10 36 erg s - 1.

In this model, the outer gap is divided into two parts, i. e. the main acceleration region on the top of last-open field lines and the <b>screening</b> <b>region</b> around the upper boundary of the gap. In the main acceleration region, the charge density is much lower than the Goldreich-Julian charge density and the charged particles are accelerated by the electric field along the magnetic field to emit multi-GeV photons. In the <b>screening</b> <b>region,</b> the charge density is larger than the Goldreich-Julian value to close the gap and particles in this region are responsible for multi- 100 MeV photon emission. We apply this three dimensional two-layer model to the Vela pulsar and compare the model light curves, the phase-averaged spectrum and the phase-resolved spectra with the recent Fermi observations, which also reveals the existence of the third peak between two main peaks. The phase position of the third peak moves with the photon energy, which cannot be explained by the geometry of magnetic field structure and the caustic effects of the photon propagation. We suggest that the existence of the third peak and its energy dependent movement results from the azimuthal structure of the outer gap.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Self-selection bias is {{considered}} to be a problem when evaluating the effectiveness of breast cancer service screening in case-control studies. OBJECTIVE: Using the incidence-based mortality method (IBM), a correction factor for the potential influence of self-selection can be derived from a group of non-screened women and a group of not-invited women. METHODS: Breast cancer patients, diagnosed in 1990 - 1995 and between the ages of 50 to 70, were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and five <b>screening</b> <b>regions</b> in the Netherlands. Person-years were calculated for non-screened and not-invited women by using population data available on the number of women invited, the number of women screened and the total population. Incidence-based breast cancer mortality rates according to screening status were calculated for the five <b>screening</b> <b>regions.</b> RESULTS: Between 1990 - 1995, 15, 541 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer. An analysis of ten-year follow-up after diagnosis resulted in 3903 breast cancer deaths, of which 2631 were not-invited and 345 were non-screened. Poisson regression analysis showed heterogeneity between the regions with a range of IBM ratios from 0. 64 (95 % CI: 0. 46 - 0. 90) to 1. 08 (95 % CI: 0. 82 - 1. 43). CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity between the regions stresses the importance of a country- and/or region- specific estimate of self-selection. Adjusting for self-selection bias in the regional case-control studies would not change the breast cancer mortality reduction in three regions and would result in an even larger effect in two regions. Looking at the range of IBM ratios the overall influence of self-selection in the Netherlands is minor...|$|R

40|$|Accurate ro-vibrational energies, eigenfunctions, radial densities, {{expectation}} {{values are}} presented for the exponential-type Manning-Rosen (MR) potential. Bound states accurate {{up to ten}} significant figure are obtained by employing a simple, reliable generalized pseudospectral method. All 55 eigenstates with n ≤ 10 are treated for arbitrary values of potential parameters, covering {{a wide range of}} interaction, through a non-uniform, optimal spatial radial discretization. A detailed investigation has been made on energy changes with respect to screening and other potential parameters. A systematic estimation of critical screening parameters are given for these eigenstates. Special emphasis has been given to higher states and in the vicinity of critical <b>screening</b> <b>region.</b> A thorough comparison with literature results is made wherever possible. This surpasses the accuracy of all other existing methods currently available. Several new states are reported for the first time. In short, a simple, efficient scheme for accurate calculation of this and other molecular potentials is offered. Comment: 16 pages, 4 figures, 5 table...|$|R
40|$|Eyetracking {{facilities}} are typically restricted to monitoring {{a single person}} viewing static images or pre-recorded video. In the present article, we describe a system {{that makes it possible}} to study visual attention in coordination with other activity during joint action. The software links two eyetracking systems in parallel and provides an on-screen task. By locating eye movements against dynamic <b>screen</b> <b>regions,</b> it permits automatic tracking of moving on-screen objects. Using existing SR technology, the system can also cross-project each participant's eyetrack and mouse location onto the other's on-screen work space. Keeping a complete record of eyetrack and on-screen events in the same format as subsequent human coding, the system permits the analysis of multiple modalities. The software offers new approaches to spontaneous multimodal communication: joint action and joint attention. These capacities are demonstrated using an experimental paradigm for cooperative on-screen assembly of a two-dimensional model. The software is available under an open source license...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{techniques for}} parallelizing rendering applications on a distributed-memory multicomputer (MANNA) that {{is linked to}} a high-performance plygon rasterizer (VISA). Several multicomputer nodes and rasterizer channels are interconnected by a highly configurable hierarchy of crosbars. Projected primitives are distributed from computing nodes to rasterizer channels according to their <b>screen</b> <b>regions.</b> An application prototype for real-time visualization of particles in a flow field from the automotive industry is implemented on this hardware platform. The system enables a user to place a particle stream interactively in a simulated flow field {{in order to gain}} insight into the characteristics of the flow field. The huge amount of data requires that both the evaluation of the flow field and the visualization of the scene be parallelized. The software architecture of the application prototype is based on the MPSC (Modifier Presenter Sensor Controller) model. We explore how it benefits from the presented scalable hardware architecture {{in order to meet the}} requirements of a highly interactive system...|$|R

40|$|Many {{investigators}} {{are now using}} haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphism (htSNPs) {{as a way of}} <b>screening</b> <b>regions</b> of the genome for association with disease. A common approach is to genotype htSNPs in a study population and to use this information to draw inferences about each individual’s haplotypic makeup, including SNPs that were not directly genotyped. To test the validity of this approach, we simulated the exercise of typing htSNPs in a large sample of individuals and compared the true and inferred haplotypes. The accuracy of haplotype inference varied, depending on the method of selecting htSNPs, the linkage-disequilibrium structure of the region, and the amount of missing data. At the stage of selection of htSNPs, haplotype-block–based methods required a larger number of htSNPs than did unstructured methods but gave lower levels of error in haplotype inference, particularly when there was a significant amount of missing data. We present a Web-based utility that allows investigators to compare the likely error rates of different sets of htSNPs and to arrive at an economical set of htSNPs that provides acceptable levels of accuracy in haplotype inference...|$|R
