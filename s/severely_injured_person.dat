40|$|In the United States, {{injury is}} the leading cause of death for persons aged 1 [...] 44 years, and the {{approximately}} 800, 000 emergency medical services (EMS) providers have a substantial impact on the care of injured persons and on public health.

40|$|First {{response}} is critical when an incident {{on the farm}} causes severe injury. The first rule is to keep calm. Adrenalin can take over {{and a series of}} emotions such as panic, fear, and anxiety can be overwhelming when a <b>severely</b> <b>injured</b> <b>person,</b> possibly a family member, is discovered. Remaining calm and taking the appropriate actions can prevent putting you or the victim in further danger and provide emergency assistance that may save the life of the injured person. The appropriate action isn’t always apparent, and each emergency may require a different response. The first responder sometimes must make difficult choices; however, your primary concerns are to: 1. Make sure that you, or the victim, are not in further danger. 2. Get professional help by calling 911 and activating emergency medical services (EMS). 3. Provide appropriate care until EMS arrive. Whether you immediately go for help or begin rendering aid depends on three things: the type of incident, the severity of the injury, and your ability to correctly administer first aid and/or CPR. Activating EMS as soon as possible can increase the chances of survival by providing advanced medical care. If there are other people with you, one person should call 911 and one person should remain to assess the scene and assist the victim. 1. Scene assessment First, size up the situation from a position that does not put you at risk of injury. Before you rush in to assist the victim, first make sure the scene is safe. Do not become another victim. Look for live wires or electrical hazards, toxic atmospheres, chemical spills, potential fire hazards, unstable equipment, or aggressive livestock. Assess what might have caused the incident. Hazards could still be present at the incident scene. If possible, safely control any hazards that could harm you or cause further harm to the victim...|$|E

The risk for death of a <b>severely</b> <b>injured</b> <b>person</b> is 25 % lower if the patient receives care at a Level I trauma center. However, not all patients require the services of a Level I trauma center; patients who are injured less severely might be served better by being transported to a closer ED capable of managing milder injuries. Transferring all injured patients to Level I trauma centers might overburden the centers, have a negative impact on patient outcomes, and decrease cost effectiveness. In 1986, the American College of Surgeons developed the Field Triage Decision Scheme (Decision Scheme), which serves as the basis for triage protocols for state and local EMS systems across the United States. The Decision Scheme is an algorithm that guides EMS providers through four decision steps (physiologic, anatomic, mechanism of injury, and special considerations) to determine the most appropriate destination facility within the local trauma care system. Since its initial publication in 1986, the Decision Scheme has been revised four times. In 2005, with support from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, CDC began facilitating revision of the Decision Scheme by hosting a series of meetings of the National Expert Panel on Field Triage, which includes injury-care providers, public health professionals, automotive industry representatives, and officials from federal agencies. The Panel reviewed relevant literature, presented its findings, and reached consensus on necessary revisions. The revised Decision Scheme was published in 2006. This report describes the process and rationale used by the Expert Panel to revise the Decision Scheme.

While the plaintiffs concerned failed in their claims, the decisions helpfully clarify questions as to whether the ‘duty of care’ analysis should be generalised or more specific, and the relevance of the ‘obviousness’ of a risk to both duty and breach questions.

50|$|Within {{the safety}} requirements, {{there is also}} a full crew of safety personnel, called the Safety Safari, whose job is to attend to any fires, clean up the track of debris after an {{accident}} on the track, and attend to the drivers prior to the arrival of any medical personnel. The Safety Safari has been in place since the late 1960s, after a rash of on track accidents caused several promising drivers to retire early. Since that time the chance of fatal injuries has been decreased but not eliminated. There is also a full staff of EMTs on hand at any event on the schedule at any given time. These EMTs are usually from the city or county the track is located in, and are compensated by the NHRA for their time and efforts. Aeromedical services are also on hand at the track for airlifting <b>severely</b> <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> to local hospitals or trauma centers if necessary.|$|R

40|$|Trauma Networks are {{currently}} founded in Germany to improve patient care of <b>severely</b> <b>injured</b> <b>persons.</b> To assure appropriate patient treatment {{in a short}} time, the transfer of radiological image data between the connected hospitals over the internet is an important method. This paper characterizes radiological image transfer patterns in a regional trauma network and analyzes various compression options. Within the “TraumaNetwork NorthWest” in Germany, the webbased platform “MedSix” was developed. MedSix is able to transfer DICOM-data quickly and easily between connected hospitals and can be directly connected to the local PACS. Audit data of the routine system between the 01. 01. 2012 and the 31. 12. 2012 were analyzed to identify typical characteristics of radiological image exchanges. Five different compression methods were compared by a simulation. MedSix {{has been used by}} 12 hospitals. 87 % of the transfers were uploaded within 15 min. Lossless compression is able to save about 50 % bandwidth. 82 % of the transfers have a data volume of less than 200 MB. Temporary accounts for nonregular users were used regularly. Most transfers were done from small to maximum care hospitals. It is feasible to substitute physical image exchange in a trauma network with electronic exchange of radiological images between the connected hospitals. Even large datasets are transferred within an acceptable time frame. Most transfers occur from small to large hospitals. The possibility of temporary accounts seems to be a key feature for the user acceptance...|$|R

40|$|The {{long-term}} physical, {{psychological and}} social outcomes of 68 patients with an ankle fracture were investigated by using a postal questionnaire 6 years after injury. Patients were treated at a level I Trauma Centre between January 1989 and December 1989. Where applicable the outcomes were compared with the outcomes of <b>severely</b> <b>injured</b> patients who were investigated previously. Physically, the patients were suffering from problems in the extremities and the spine. Surprisingly, half of them (52 per cent) had psychological complaints due to the initial injury. Eighty-nine per cent of the patients returned to work. This result seems to be only slightly better than the return to work in <b>severely</b> <b>injured</b> patients (74 per cent). Those with an ankle injury fracture needed less time {{to return to work}} (3 months versus 13 months in the <b>severely</b> <b>injured</b> patients). Further social changes (marital status, leisure activities) were mostly found in the <b>severely</b> <b>injured</b> patients. Patients with an ankle fracture as well as <b>severely</b> <b>injured</b> patients are affected by long-term consequences. The {{differences between the two groups}} are not as pronounced as is generally assumed.
