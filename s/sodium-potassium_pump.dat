5|$|By {{means of}} the <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pump,</b> living human cells pump three sodium ions out of the cell in {{exchange}} for two potassium ions pumped in; comparing ion concentrations across the cell membrane, inside to outside, potassium measures about 40:1, and sodium, about 1:10. In nerve cells, the electrical charge across the cell membrane enables transmission of the nerve impulse—an action potential—when the charge is dissipated; sodium {{plays a key role}} in that activity.|$|E
5|$|Potassium {{levels can}} {{fluctuate}} severely during {{the treatment of}} DKA, because insulin decreases potassium levels in the blood by redistributing it into cells via increased <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pump</b> activity. A {{large part of the}} shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis. Hypokalemia (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of dangerous irregularities in the heart rate. Therefore, continuous observation of the heart rate is recommended, as well as repeated measurement of the potassium levels and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3mmol/l. If potassium levels fall below 3.3mmol/l, insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of the hypokalemia.|$|E
25|$|These {{forms of}} {{transport}} require energy, as the products being transported are usually moving against a higher concentration gradient. This process, called active transport, get its energy from ATP and other ATP-related cotransport systems that produce energy, like the <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E
40|$|Animal {{studies have}} shown that {{potassium}} depletion induced by diuretics or potassium deficient fodder leads to a selective decrease in the concentrations of potassium and in the concentration of <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pumps</b> in skeletal muscle. In 25 patients who had received diuretics for 2 - 14 years the mean concentrations of potassium, magnesium, and <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pumps</b> were measured in skeletal muscle biopsy specimens and were significantly lower than in those from a group of age matched controls. The reductions in all three variables were significant in those patients receiving diuretics for arterial hypertension as well as in those being treated for congestive heart failure. In 14 patients the mean muscle potassium concentration was below the control range, but only one of those was hypokalaemic (3 · 4 mmol/l), and 13 were receiving potassium supplements. In 15 patients the mean muscle magnesium concentration was below normal, and the mean muscle potassium and magnesium concentrations showed a linear correlation. In 12 patients in whom the mean muscle potassium concentration was below 80 μmol/g wet weight there was a linear correlation between the cellular potassium:sodium ratio and the concentration of 3 H-ouabain binding sites indicating that potassium deficiency also leads to a down regulation of <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pumps</b> in human skeletal muscle...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} {{mechanisms}} {{that lead to}} potassium deficiency due to cola drinks. They are as follows: (1) a large intake of glucose which leads to an intracellular redistribution of potassium; (2) potassium wasting due to large masses of indigestible fructose in the gastrointestinal tract; (3) the caffeine in cola drinks lead to diuresis, {{an increase in the}} <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pumps</b> via cellular phosphodiesterase inhibition, increased renin levels, and also produced metabolic alkalosis which all lead to hypokalemia.|$|R
25|$|Julius Bernstein {{was also}} the first to {{introduce}} the Nernst equation for resting potential across the membrane; this was generalized by David E. Goldman to the eponymous Goldman equation in 1943. The <b>sodium–potassium</b> <b>pump</b> was identified in 1957 and its properties gradually elucidated, culminating in the determination of its atomic-resolution structure by X-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of related ionic pumps have also been solved, giving a broader view of how these molecular machines work.|$|E
25|$|Ion {{channels}} are pore-forming membrane proteins that allow ions {{to pass through}} the channel pore. Their functions include establishing a resting membrane potential, shaping action potentials and other electrical signals by gating the flow of ions across the cell membrane, controlling the flow of ions across secretory and epithelial cells, and regulating cell volume. Ion {{channels are}} present in the membranes of all cells. Ion channels are one of the two classes of ionophoric proteins, along with ion transporters (including the <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pump,</b> sodium-calcium exchanger, and sodium-glucose transport proteins).|$|E
25|$|If {{substrate}} molecules {{are moving}} from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration (i.e., {{in the opposite}} direction as, or against the concentration gradient), specific transmembrane carrier proteins are required. These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., glucose) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell by the <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pump.</b> Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the small intestine.|$|E
50|$|Cardiac glycosides {{affect the}} <b>sodium-{{potassium}}</b> ATPase <b>pump</b> in cardiac muscle cells {{to alter their}} function. Normally, these <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pumps</b> move potassium ions in and sodium ions out. Cardiac glycosides, however, inhibit this pump by stabilizing it in the E2-P transition state, so that sodium cannot be extruded: intracellular sodium concentration therefore increases. With regards to potassium ion movement, because both cardiac glycosides and potassium compete for binding to the ATPase pump, changes in extracellular potassium concentration can potentially lead to altered drug efficacy. Nevertheless, by carefully controlling the dosage, such adverse effects can be avoided. Continuing on with the mechanism, raised intracellular sodium levels inhibit the function of a second membrane ion exchanger, NCX, {{which is responsible for}} pumping calcium ions out of the cell and sodium ions in at a ratio of 3Na/Ca. Thus, calcium ions are also not extruded and will begin to build up inside the cell as well.|$|R
25|$|Alcohol's {{rewarding}} {{and reinforcing}} (i.e., addictive) properties are mediated through {{its effects on}} dopamine neurons in the mesolimbic reward pathway, which connects the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). One of alcohol's primary effects is the allosteric inhibition of NMDA receptors and facilitation of GABAA receptors (e.g., enhanced GABAA receptor-mediated chloride flux through allosteric regulation of the receptor). At high doses, ethanol inhibits most ligand gated ion channels and voltage gated ion channels in neurons as well. Alcohol inhibits <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pumps</b> in the cerebellum and this is likely how it impairs cerebellar computation and body co-ordination.|$|R
40|$|We studied single neuron {{dynamics}} during anoxic depolarizations, {{which are}} often observed in cases of neuronal energy depletion. Anoxic and similar depolarizations {{play an important role}} in several pathologies, notably stroke, migraine, and epilepsy. One of the effects of energy depletion was experimentally simulated in slices of rat cortex by blocking the <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pumps</b> with ouabain. The membrane voltage of pyramidal cells was measured. Five different kinds of dynamical behavior of the membrane voltage were observed during the resulting depolarizations. Using bifurcation analysis of a single cell model, we show that these voltage dynamics all are responses of the same cell, with normally functioning ion channels, to particular courses of the intra- and extracellular concentrations of sodium and potassium. © 2013 the American Physiological Society...|$|R

2500|$|Most of the {{enzymes that}} perform {{this type of}} {{transport}} are transmembrane ATPases. A primary ATPase universal to all animal life is the <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pump,</b> which helps to maintain the cell potential. The <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pump</b> maintains the membrane potential by moving three Na+ [...] ions out of the cell for every two [...] K+ ions moved into the cell. Other sources of energy for Primary active transport are redox energy and photon energy (light). [...] An example of primary active transport using Redox energy is the mitochondrial electron transport chain that uses the reduction energy of NADH to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient. [...] An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in photosynthesis that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane and also to create reduction power {{in the form of}} NADPH.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} ions {{involved in}} an action potential are sodium and potassium cations; sodium ions enter the cell, and potassium ions leave, restoring equilibrium. Relatively few ions need to cross the membrane for the membrane voltage to change drastically. The ions exchanged during an action potential, therefore, make a negligible change in the interior and exterior ionic concentrations. The few ions that do cross are pumped out again by the continuous action of the <b>sodium–potassium</b> <b>pump,</b> which, with other ion transporters, maintains the normal ratio of ion concentrations across the membrane. [...] Calcium cations and chloride anions {{are involved in a}} few types of action potentials, such as the cardiac action potential and the action potential in the single-cell alga Acetabularia, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sodium-potassium</b> {{exchange}} <b>pump</b> {{is relatively}} slow in operation.

Indeed, a mutation in the - pump causes rapid onset dystonia parkinsonism, which has symptoms to indicate that it is a pathology of cerebellar computation. Furthermore, an ouabain block of - pumps in the cerebellum of a live mouse results in it displaying ataxia and dystonia. Alcohol inhibits <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pumps</b> in the cerebellum and this is likely how it corrupts cerebellar computation and body co-ordination. The distribution of the - pump on myelinated axons, in human brain, was demonstrated to be along the internodal axolemma, and not within the nodal axolemma as previously thought.|$|R
40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pumps</b> that regulate intracellular sodium in most animal cells have specific, high-affinity receptors for the digitalis glycosides and their aglycones. This has fostered speculation {{that there is}} an endogenous ligand. We have purified and structurally identified by mass spectroscopy an endogenous substance from human plasma that binds with high affinity to this receptor and that is indistinguishable from the cardenolide ouabain. This human ouabain-like compound (OLC) displaces [3 H]ouabain from its receptor, inhibits Na,K-ATPase and ouabain-sensitive 86 Rb+ uptake, and has cardiotonic actions quantitatively similar to commercial ouabain. Immunoreactive OLC was detected in the plasma of many mammals, and high concentrations were found in the adrenals. The circulating OLC may modulate intracellular Na+ and affect numerous Na+ gradient-dependent processes including intracellular Ca 2 + and pH homeostasis in many tissues. Furthermore, altered circulating levels of OLC may be associated with the pathogenesis of certain forms of hypertension...|$|R

Ataxia is observed for lower ouabain concentrations, dystonia is observed at higher ouabain concentrations. A mutation in the - pump (ATP1A3 gene) can cause rapid onset dystonia parkinsonism. The parkinsonism aspect of this disease is thought to be attributable to malfunctioning - pumps in the basal ganglia; the dystonia aspect is thought to be attributable to malfunctioning - pumps in the cerebellum (that act to corrupt its input to the basal ganglia) [...] possibly in Purkinje neurons.|$|E

The wave is caused by membrane potential oscillations, that occur after the cessation of activity of the <b>sodium-potassium</b> <b>pumps</b> has lead to an excess of extracellular potassium. These oscillations can be described by the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for the sodium and potassium channels, and result in a sudden change in mean membrane voltage.

A problem, however, is that detailed neuron descriptions are computationally expensive and this handicaps {{the pursuit of}} realistic network investigations, where many neurons need to be simulated.
