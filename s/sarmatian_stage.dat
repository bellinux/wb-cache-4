40|$|ABSTRACT: The Vienna Basin and the Styrian Basin {{have been}} {{cornerstones}} for the definition and {{description of the}} Central Euro-pean <b>Sarmatian</b> <b>Stage.</b> New inter- and intrabasin correlations of well-logs and surface outcrops reveal a rather uniform development of depositional systems in all considered basins, which excludes local autocyclic processes as the sole trigger. The lithostratigraphy of these basins is critically summarized and the Wolfsthal Member is introduced as a new lithostratigraphic unit. The more than 1000 -m-thick Sarmatian basin-fill is recorded in geophysical logs by a characteristic succession of serrated funnel-to bell-shaped curves separated by shale-line intervals. The correlative floodings are well preserved in marginal settings and accessible in surface outcrops. Slight falls of the relative sea-level are also reflected in the littoral zone by erosive surfaces, caliche formation and progradation of fluvial facies. The stratigraphic position and duration of the Sarmatian suggests a relation to the 3 rd order cycle TB. 2. 6. Internally, two 4 th order cycles are depicted. An exact correlation with Mediterranean standard stages and the “Haq-cycles ” is difficult due to the endemic marine fauna that flourished in the nearly land-locked Paratethys Sea during the Sarmatian. This obstacle may be overcome by a first cautious calibration of the sedimentary sequence with astronomical target curves. Hence, the 400 -Ka eccentricity component might have triggered the 4 th or-der cycles, with the maximum flooding surfaces coinciding with the maxima of that band. An overall trend from a pelitic-siliciclastic Lower Sarmatian 4 th order cycle towards an oolitic Upper Sarmatian 4 th order cycle could be forced by the inflection of the 2. 35 -Ma component. The tentative calibration requires a new positioning of the Badenian/Sarmatian boundary close to 12. 7 Ma, which would fi...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the Miocene {{evolution of the}} Central Paratethys and neighboring Dinaride Mountains. The Central Paratethys was a vast epicontinental sea covering most of central and southeastern Europe during the Oligo-Miocene. The Dinarides were situated along the southwestern border of the former Central Paratethys, separating it from the Mediterranean. An extensive long-lived lake system thrived in the orogen’s intra-montane basins during the Late Oligocene and Miocene. The intrinsic isolation of the Dinaride Lakes and the progressive isolation of the Paratethys led to severe faunal endemism, which hampers straightforward biostratigraphic correlation of their deposits to radio-isotopically or cyclostratigraphically dated sedimentary records elsewhere. High resolution age constraints are thus generally lacking, which obstructs global or even regional correlation of events apparent in the geological record and thus limits our insight in the geodynamic and paleogeographic history of southeastern Europe. This is, in our opinion, {{one of the most}} fundamental geological problems to be solved in this area. The main objective of this thesis is therefore to provide new age constraints for the Dinaride Lake System and Central Paratethys applying radio-isotopic, cyclostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic dating methods. We first turn to the Dinaride Lake System and construct chronologies for lacustrine deposition in the Sinj, Livno Tomislavgrad, Gacko, Banovići, and South Pannonian Basins. We synthesize the acquired results and supplement these with tectonic rotations of the area, using new paleomagnetic data and a compilation of existing data for the Dinarides and Adria. A first phase of intra-montane basin formation occurred in the late Oligocene when strike-slip faulting penetrated into the orogen. A second phase of basin formation took place between 18 and 13 Ma, concurrent with profound extension in the neighbouring Pannonian Basin. The Dinarides did not experience any significant tectonic rotation since the late Oligocene. These results significantly improve our insight in the post-orogenic evolution of the Dinarides and resolve the apparent controversy between structural geological and paleomagnetic rotation estimates for the Dinarides as well as Adria. The Middle Miocene evolution of the Central Paratethys is characterized by multiple isolation events. We present a new chronology for the catastrophic Badenian Salinity Crisis which triggered evaporite deposition in large parts of the sea and exterminated a great number of its species. Evaporite deposition began at 13. 81 ± 0. 08 Ma, shortly after glacial event Mi- 3 b. The global sea level fall that occurred in conjunction with the Mi- 3 b event most likely restricted the open marine connection with the Mediterranean trapping salt in the deep Paratethys basins. The entire event is estimated to have lasted 200 to 600 kyr. Normal marine conditions were restored in the Central Paratethys after the salinity crisis. A new chronostratigraphy for the Middle Miocene infill of the Transylvanian Basin indicates that renewed isolation at the transition from the Badenian to the <b>Sarmatian</b> <b>stage,</b> reflected again in a distinctive faunal turnover, occurred at 12. 80 ± 0. 05 Ma. The final isolation and transition from marine to fresh water occurred at 11. 3 Ma concurrent with enhanced uplift in the Carpathians and a 20 ° clockwise rotation of the Transylvanian Basin.

40|$|Middle Miocene {{sedimentary}} {{record of}} VSP- 1 borehole {{situated in the}} East Slovakian Basin area was studied on well cores and well log diagrams. Documented sedimentary structures provided valuable information about the mode of transport and deposition, as well as about subsequent synsedimentary changes in soft sediment. Different transport mechanisms and depositional environments provide important information on the basin palaeogeography during the Serravalian (Upper Badenian and Lower <b>Sarmatian</b> regional <b>stages),</b> since the depositional environment {{in the study area}} changed from the deeper neritic environment of basin slope or lower part of the delta slope to the shallow neritic to littoral, coastal or delta plain environment. Deep water setting is characterized mainly by fine-grained sediments of gravity flows with slumps, showing grain flow to turbidity current features. The typical sedimentary structures are: erosive base of beds, normal grading, etc. Sediments are usually disturbed by synsedimentary deformations as slumps and growth faults. Shallow water setting was identified on the basis of specific sedimentary structures as: planar cross and trough cross bedding, ripple marks, hummocky cross stratification, flaser, wave and lenticular bedding. These sedimentary structures originated in shallow water, high energy environment, but each of them at different dynamic condition. Results obtained by the study of sedimentary record of the VSP- 1 borehole fit well with the Upper Badenian and Lower Sarmatian palaeogeographical models of Vass et al. (2002) and confirm the rightness of defined changes of depositional environment in the Trebišov Depression of the East Slovakian Basin in time and space...|$|R
40|$|On the {{south-western}} {{slope of}} Medvednica Mt., an 83 m thick geological column Kostanjek- 1, composed of strata representing the <b>Sarmatian</b> and Pannonian <b>stages,</b> {{was investigated in}} detail. Facies analysis allowed separation of five lithofacies units (A, AB, B, C and D) and the sedimentary mechanisms for particular successions were defined. A rich community of fossil molluscs (50 species) and ostracods (42 species) was sampled and determined. From these fossil determinations, the sediment age was defined, and biofacies analysis allowed the determination of three basic palaeobiocenosis types: 1) a community from Sarmatian brackish lagoons, 2) a community from an Early Pannonian littoral lake, and 3) a lake basin community in the Late Pannonian. The main “record” of the salinity crisis (drop) at the Sarmatian-Pannonian boundary influences in a selective way the majority of organisms, and is shown best in the evolutionary form changes of cardid bivalves, for which phylogenetic series were made. On the basis of dominant and characteristic forms in the entire association of Pannonian molluscs five biozones were separated: I) Lymnocardium praeponticum acrozone, II) Radix croatica - Lymnocardium plicataeformis - Gyraulus praeponticus cenozone, III) Neodelminiella venusta - Lymnocardium cekusi cenozone, IV) Congeria banatica - Lymnocardium gorjanovici - Gyraulus tenuistriatus cenozone and V) Congeria czjzeki - Lymnocardium winkleri - Gyraulus tenuistriatus cenozone.
