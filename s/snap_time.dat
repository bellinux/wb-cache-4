60|$|A fiery-haired Scot, a Highlander of the Isles, sat upon a barrel-head sawing at a fiddle, and {{the shrill}} scream of it filled the barn. Tone {{he did not}} aspire to, but he played with Caledonian verve and swing, and kept the <b>snapping</b> <b>time.</b> It was mad, harsh music {{of the kind that}} sets the blood {{tingling}} and the feet to move in rhythm, though the exhilarating effect of it was rather spoiled by the efforts of the little French Canadian who had another fiddle and threw in clanging chords upon the lower strings.|$|R
60|$|Then began {{a contest}} {{as to which}} could drown the other's instrument, and the <b>snapping</b> <b>time</b> grew faster, until the dancers gasped, and men who wore long boots {{encouraged}} them with cries and stamped a staccato accompaniment upon the benches or on the floor. It was savage, rasping music, but one player infused into it the ebullient nerve of France, {{and the other was}} from the misty land where the fiddler learns the witchery of the clanging reel and the swing of the Strathspey. It is doubtless not high art, but there is probably no music in the world that fires the blood like this and turns the sober dance to rhythmic riot. Perhaps, too, amid the prairie snow, it gains something that gives it a closer compelling grip.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} household food security status, <b>SNAP</b> participation, and <b>time</b> used in food preparation and acquisition. Using the American Time Use Survey linked with the Current Population Survey's Food Security Supplement, we find that food insecurity and SNAP participation are positive predictors of number of minutes single adult households use in food preparation. Meanwhile, SNAP participation is a negative predictor of food acquisition. Although these results do not imply a causal relationship, they do reveal reflect that food insecure households and households that participate in the <b>SNAP</b> program use <b>time</b> differently than food secure and non-participating households. food security, <b>time</b> use, <b>SNAP,</b> Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Food Security and Poverty,...|$|R
60|$|His cries soon reached {{those around}} the campfire, and a grand rush {{was made to}} the water's edge. By this <b>time</b> <b>Snap</b> had rounded {{the point of the}} cove and was rowing as rapidly as {{possible}} in the direction where the raft lay.|$|R
2500|$|Salvage {{efforts on}} the morning of 29 June 2007 were {{hampered}} by more cables <b>snapping,</b> this <b>time</b> it was cables attached to the [...] "Supertug" [...] Pacific Responder and a sea anchor. Ballast water was reloaded to help preserve the initial gains that were made and the next attempt to move the ship was deferred to the evening of 1 July 2007 to allow salvage engineers more time to secure new cables to the tugs and between the winches and sea anchors.|$|R
25|$|Buffalo's miscue {{on their}} final drive was {{particularly}} noteworthy {{in that it}} came after they had called a timeout, making a subsequent delay of game penalty highly unusual. One cited reason for {{this was the last}} second substitution of receivers Piccone and Ron Jessie into the huddle. Bills coach Chuck Knox later explained this was an attempt to prevent the defense from adjusting to new personnel, an attempt that would have paid off if the ball had been <b>snapped</b> on <b>time,</b> as Piccone did make a first down catch on the ensuing play.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Shelton {{started the}} first 15 {{games of the}} season at left tackle for Arizona and took part in all 921 {{offensive}} <b>snaps</b> over that <b>time.</b> He sustained a sprained ankle at the Seattle Seahawks on December 21 and was inactive for finale against the Minnesota Vikings the following week.|$|R
25|$|The clock starts {{again when}} the referee determines the ball is ready for scrimmage, except for team time-outs (where the clock starts at the <b>snap),</b> after a <b>time</b> count foul (at the snap) and kickoffs (where the clock starts not at the kick but when the ball is first touched after the kick).|$|R
60|$|Such {{were some}} of the cries uttered. Then someone ran for a shotgun, but by this <b>time</b> <b>Snap</b> was out of sight around a fringe of brushwood.

5000|$|At UTEP's Pro Day workout, {{in which}} six teams attended, Dorenbos {{averaged}} 0.62 seconds in snapping {{the ball to}} the punter. One <b>snap</b> was <b>timed</b> at 0.59 seconds. A good time in the NFL is considered between 0.70 seconds and 0.75 seconds. Then-St. Louis Rams special teams coach Bobby April said of his workout, [...] "Even on tape it's clear the guy is amazing. He's the best I've seen this year. And he might be the best in a lot of years, maybe among the top guys I've ever seen...But I'll tell you, Dorenbos is something else, he really is, man."

50|$|Smith {{attended}} the University of Alabama beginning in 2006. He played for coach Nick Saban's Alabama Crimson Tide football team from 2006 to 2008. In his initial year at Alabama, he started all 13 games at left tackle, becoming only the fourth true freshman offensive lineman to {{start for the}} Crimson Tide. Smith played at least 65 snaps in 10 of 13 games and played more than 70 <b>snaps</b> five <b>times,</b> while leading the Crimson Tide with 62 pancake blocks. He also scored a touchdown off of a lateral in the 34-31 Independence Bowl loss against Oklahoma State. Smith earned Freshman All-American honors by the Football Writers Association of America.|$|R
60|$|By this <b>time</b> <b>Snap</b> {{was ready}} for another shot, and growing bolder, he watched his chance, ran in and let the bear have the buckshot {{directly}} between the eyes. Then Shep took a second shot also, hitting Bruin in the throat. This {{was too much for}} the bear, and with a quiver and a gasp he sank in a heap, and a moment later breathed his last.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} sonar {{detection}} and underwater {{communication in the}} presence of impulsive snapping shrimp noise is considered. Non-Gaussian amplitude and nonhomogeneous Poisson temporal statistical models of shrimp noise are investigated {{from the perspective of a}} single hydrophone immersed in shallow waters. New statistical models of the noise are devised and used to both challenge the superiority of existing models, and to provide alternative insights into the underlying physical processes. A heuristic amplitude statistical model of snapping shrimp noise is derived from first principles and compared with the Symmetric-α-stable model. The models are shown to have similar variability through the body of the amplitude probability density functions of real shrimp noise, however the new model is shown to have a superior fit to the extreme tails. Narrow-band detection using locally optimum detectors derived from these models show that the Symmetric-α-stable detector retains it's superiority, despite providing a poorer overall fit to the amplitude probability density functions. The results also confirm the superiority of the Symmetric-α-stable detector for detection of narrowband signals in shrimp noise from Australian waters. The temporal nature of snapping from a field of shrimp is investigated by considering the snapping as a point process in time. Point process analysis techniques are drawn from the fields of optics, neuro-physics, molecular biology, finance and computer science, and applied to the problem of snapping shrimp noise. It is concluded that the snapping is not consistent with a homogeneous Poisson process and that correlations exist in the point process on three different time scales. The cause of short time correlations is identified as surface reflected replicas, and models of medium time correlations are investigated. It is shown that a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross driven doubly-stochastic Poisson model is able to describe the medium time correlations observed from the counting process, but a k[superscript]th-order interval analysis reveals that there is more information contained within the snapping than can be described by the model. Analysis of shrimp <b>snap</b> <b>times</b> over a full day provides evidence of correlation between snap events on long time scales. Simulation of ocean noise is conducted to illustrate the use of such temporal models, and implications for their use in detection algorithms are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|The shotgun {{formation}} is a formation {{used by the}} offensive team in American and Canadian football. This {{formation is}} used mainly for passing plays, although some teams use it as their base formation. In the shotgun, instead of the quarterback receiving the snap from center {{at the line of}} scrimmage, he stands farther behind the line of scrimmage, often five to seven yards back. Sometimes the quarterback will have a back on one or both sides before the <b>snap,</b> while other <b>times</b> he will be the lone player in the backfield with everyone spread out as receivers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we present an {{interactive}} system that integrates the visual analysis of nerve fiber pathway approximations from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with electroencephalography (EEG) data. The technique uses source reconstructions from EEG data to define certain regions {{of interest in}} the brain. These regions, in turn, are used to selectively display subsets of the approximated fiber pathways in the brain. The selected pathways highlight potential connections from activated ar-eas {{to other parts of the}} brain and can thus help to understand networks on which most higher brain function relies. Users can explore the neuronal network and ac-tivity by navigating in an EEG curve view. The navigation is supported by optional mechanisms like <b>snapping</b> to <b>time</b> points with present reconstructed dipoles and visual cues highlighting such points. To the best of our knowledge, the presented combination of time navigation in EEG curves together with DTI pathway selection at the corresponding dipole positions is new and has not been described before. The presented methods are freely available in an open source system for visualization and analysis in neuroscience...|$|R
50|$|Bret Culbertson of Iowa State {{kicked a}} 24—yard {{field goal with}} 12:21 {{left in the game}} to put the Cyclones up 31—21. Kevin Eberhart of Colorado had earlier missed a 43—yard field goal. Colorado then fought back and Scotty McKnight scored a 9—yard {{touchdown}} pass from Cody Hawkins with 2:40 left in the game. The defensed forced a 3 and out after the kickoff to get the ball back with 46 seconds left in the game on their own 28 yard line. In 5 passing plays, 4 complete, they moved the ball 34 yards to the Iowa State 33 yard line. With no timeouts, they rushed the field goal unit on to the field and Eberhart made a 50—yard field goal with 1 second left on the clock. However, Colorado was penalized 5 yards for snapping the ball before it was whistled ready for play (officially Offensive Delay of Game) which nullified the field goal. With 1 second left on the clock, Eberhart again made the 55—yard field goal try, but the officials ruled the ball had not been <b>snapped</b> before <b>time</b> expired. The field goal was again nullified and the game was over.|$|R
