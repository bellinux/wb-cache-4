5|$|<b>Stainless</b> steels {{contain a}} minimum of 11% chromium, often {{combined}} with nickel, to resist corrosion. Some <b>stainless</b> steels, such as the ferritic <b>stainless</b> steels are magnetic, while others, such as the austenitic, are nonmagnetic. Corrosion-resistant steels are abbreviated as CRES.|$|E
5|$|He {{applied for}} another patent on an alloy he called <b>stainless</b> steel, {{now known as}} {{martensitic}} <b>stainless</b> steel. The Patent Office rejected his application {{saying that it was}} not a new alloy. Haynes conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals, and it was granted. At the urging of his wife, he created the first set of <b>stainless</b> steel silverware for her personal use. The first piece of <b>stainless</b> steel was forged by Homer Dan Farmer in Haynes laboratory. It was a large meat knife and was donated to the Haynes Museum by the family of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan Farmer. In later years he claimed to have created <b>stainless</b> steel because she did not enjoy polishing their silver tableware. British metallurgist Harry Brearley independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and applied for an American patent and found that one already existed. Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they were of little value without the <b>stainless</b> steel patent. He sought out Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce the alloy. Haynes sold his <b>stainless</b> steel patent in 1918 to the American <b>Stainless</b> Steel Company, a company Brearley had created with the assistance of investors in Pennsylvania. In exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he installed his son, March, to represent him. The income from the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large fortune.|$|E

5|$|Molybdenum is also {{valued in}} steel alloys for its high {{corrosion}} resistance and weldability. Molybdenum contributes corrosion resistance to type-300 <b>stainless</b> steels (specifically type-316) and especially {{so in the}} so-called superaustenitic <b>stainless</b> steels (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO or 1925hMo). Molybdenum increases lattice strain, thus increasing the energy required to dissolve iron atoms from the surface. Molybdenum {{is also used to}} enhance the corrosion resistance of ferritic (for example grade 444) and martensitic (for example 1.4122 and 1.4418) <b>stainless</b> steels.|$|E
5|$|The company {{put both}} its carbon mill in Calvert and a steel slab-making unit in Rio de Janeiro {{up for sale}} in May 2012, citing rising {{production}} costs and a worldwide decrease in demand. ThyssenKrupp's <b>stainless</b> steel division, Inoxum, including the <b>stainless</b> portion of the Calvert plant, was sold to Finnish <b>stainless</b> steel company Outokumpu Oyi in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Ferrochromium alloy is commercially {{produced}} from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium. Chromium metal is of high value for its high corrosion resistance and hardness. A major development was {{the discovery that}} steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form <b>stainless</b> steel. <b>Stainless</b> steel and chrome plating (electroplating with chromium) together comprise 85% of the commercial use.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Ralph Budd met Edward G. Budd (no relation), an {{automotive}} steel pioneer who was {{founder and}} president of the Budd Company. Edward Budd was demonstrating his new Budd-Michelin rail motorcar built of <b>stainless</b> steel. Pneumatic-wheeled railcars never found popularity for actual service in the US - they tended to derail - but they demonstrated the successful construction of lightweight <b>stainless</b> steel unibody railcars.|$|E
5|$|Plumbing and wiring {{were covered}} with {{protective}} insulation. Aluminum tubing was replaced with <b>stainless</b> steel tubing that used brazed joints when possible.|$|E
5|$|Richard Kiel as Jaws: Drax's {{replacement}} bodyguard after Chang is killed, {{afflicted by}} giantism and possessing {{a set of}} <b>stainless</b> steel teeth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stainless</b> steel was {{discovered}} by Harry Brearley in 1912, at the Brown Firth Laboratories in Sheffield. His successor as manager at Brown Firth, Dr William Hatfield, continued Brealey's work. In 1924 he patented '18-8 <b>stainless</b> steel', which to this day {{is probably the most}} common alloy of this type.|$|E
5|$|Used to {{test the}} pitting and crevice {{corrosion}} resistance of <b>stainless</b> steels and other alloys.|$|E
5|$|About 86% of {{molybdenum}} produced {{is used in}} metallurgy, {{with the}} rest used in chemical applications. The estimated global use is structural steel 35%, <b>stainless</b> steel 25%, chemicals 14%, tool & high-speed steels 9%, cast iron 6%, molybdenum elemental metal 6%, and superalloys 5%.|$|E
5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge <b>stainless</b> steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic <b>stainless</b> steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
5|$|Chromium {{content of}} common foods is {{generally}} low (1-13 micrograms per serving). Chromium content of food varies widely due {{to differences in}} soil mineral content, growing season, plant cultivar, and contamination during processing. In addition, large amounts of chromium (and nickel) leach into food cooked in <b>stainless</b> steel.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Arne Jacobsen {{became the}} country’s leading Modernist {{with the design}} of the SAS Hotel in Copenhagen (1960). Rødovre Town Hall, {{completed}} in 1956, shows how well Jacobsen combined the use of different materials: sandstone, two types of glass, painted metalwork and <b>stainless</b> steel.|$|E
5|$|Empires: Dawn of the Modern World is a 2003 {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} developed by <b>Stainless</b> Steel Studios {{and published by}} Activision. Set in a world-historical period that extends from the Middle Ages to World War II, the game tasks players with guiding one of nine rival great civilizations to victory. Customer surveys from <b>Stainless</b> Steel's previous game, Empire Earth, were used {{as a starting point}} for Empires: these inspired the team to take a more minimalist design approach, and to include civilizations without overlapping styles of play. Empires was positively received by critics, who enjoyed its multiplayer component. However, certain reviewers disliked its single-player mode, and opinion clashed on the game's level of uniqueness compared to competitors such as Rise of Nations. The sales of Empires, when combined with those of Empire Earth, totaled 2.5 million units by 2004.|$|E
5|$|German {{technology}} conglomerate ThyssenKrupp broke {{ground on}} a $4.65 billion combined <b>stainless</b> and carbon steel processing facility in Calvert, {{a few miles}} north of Mobile, in 2007. It was originally projected to eventually employ 2,700 people. The facility became operational in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the natural light from the atrium and skylights, the building is further illuminated inside by lightboxes and screens {{that are part of}} the artwork. Other interior details include steel mesh, a central courtyard, panels of <b>stainless</b> steel, pillars with burnished steel, and excerpts from the United States Constitution on the wall. Also, the areas leading into the elevators have clear panels in the floor, and the main staircase is also constructed partly of transparent materials, with the steps made of gray slate. The exterior ribbons of <b>stainless</b> steel also extend into the lobby of the building.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Mn and atomic number 25. It is not found {{as a free}} element in nature; it is often found in minerals in combination with iron. Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses, particularly in <b>stainless</b> steels.|$|E
5|$|Most {{high-strength}} steel alloys (for example, 41xx steels) contain 0.25% to 8% molybdenum. Even in these small portions, more than 43,000 tonnes of molybdenum are used {{each year in}} <b>stainless</b> steels, tool steels, cast irons, and high-temperature superalloys.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is {{obtained}} through extractive metallurgy: it is {{extracted from the}} ore by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield a metal of greater than 75% purity. In many <b>stainless</b> steel applications, 75% pure nickel can be used without further purification, depending on the impurities.|$|E
5|$|Niobium {{is used in}} {{arc welding}} rods for some {{stabilized}} grades of <b>stainless</b> steel and in anodes for cathodic protection systems on some water tanks, which are then usually plated with platinum.|$|E
5|$|Since the Pioneer Zephyr {{was built}} of <b>stainless</b> steel, {{which is not}} as {{recyclable}} as aluminum, the train was spared from the metal recycling drives of World War II. By contrast, Union Pacific's M-10000, built of aluminum, was scrapped in 1942 for the war effort, among other reasons.|$|E
5|$|Slate Yorkshire Square brewing vessels {{were used}} at the brewery from 1913 until 1975. <b>Stainless</b> steel Yorkshire Squares were in use by at least 1953, but were removed in the 1980s, and the brewery now uses conical tanks. By 1953, the brewery site {{occupied}} 20 acres.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 artwork here {{is called}} In Memory of The Lost Battalion by Pablo Tauler. It uses nine support beams in the station's {{mezzanine}} wrapped in different materials— including glass, iron, and <b>stainless</b> steel—to honor {{the soldiers who}} served in the 77th Infantry Division during World War I.|$|E
5|$|The Pioneer Zephyr is a {{diesel-powered}} railroad train formed {{of railroad}} cars permanently articulated together with Jacobs bogies, {{built by the}} Budd Company in 1934 for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB), {{commonly known as the}} Burlington. The train featured extensive use of <b>stainless</b> steel, was originally named the Zephyr, and was meant as a promotional tool to advertise passenger rail service in the United States. The construction included innovations such as shotwelding (a specialized type of spot welding) to join the <b>stainless</b> steel, and articulation to reduce its weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions {{similar to those of the}} base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, <b>stainless</b> steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld <b>stainless</b> steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.|$|E
5|$|The nose cone, which {{contained}} the ordnance that would impact the target, would {{separate from the}} rocket booster. This made the rocket lighter as only the nose cone and its ordnance {{had to be able}} to survive re-entry, rather than the rocket. The unique innovations of the Hiroc missiles, such as the gimballed engines, and the internally supported frame, would go on to inspire the Atlas rockets. Several things changed however, such as the aluminum used for the missiles skin of the Hiroc, was switched out for <b>stainless</b> steel in the Atlas, because <b>stainless</b> steel had a higher melting point. The engines of the Atlas missiles were also much stronger, generating a total of 150,000 pounds-force (667,000 Newtons), compared to the Hiroc's total of 8,000 pounds-force (35,585 Newtons).|$|E
5|$|The <b>stainless</b> steel {{cladding}} is ribbed and riveted {{in the shape}} of sunbeams, with many triangular windows. Due to the curved shape of the dome, the Nirosta sheets had to be measured on site, so most of the work was carried out in workshops on the building's 67th and 75th floors.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} types of torches {{designed}} for use on the relay: a standard solid fuel powered torch made of aluminium, a special butane gas torch used onboard HMS Whitesand Bay, and a final torch used to enter Empire Stadium that was made of <b>stainless</b> steel and powered by a magnesium candle.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Equities Realty was {{responsible}} for negotiating contracts with Gehry and all contractors. Walsh Construction and its subcontractors were hired to execute three elements of Gehry's design: the structural steel supporting the <b>stainless</b> steel ribbons, the ribbons themselves and the trellis and associated sound system.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{stations}} in the system, which do not have open public restrooms, there are public restrooms in the station. The station also has a <b>stainless</b> steel oval-shaped station agent booth.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium {{can also}} be used as a dopant to help improve the grain refinement, strength, and other {{mechanical}} properties of <b>stainless</b> steel. Some ytterbium alloys have rarely been used in dentistry.|$|E
5|$|A {{differently}} designed torch {{was used}} for the final leg. It was made of <b>stainless</b> steel and was fueled by magnesium {{in order to ensure that}} the flame showed up properly during the opening ceremony. It was also designed by Ralph Lavers, with the frame for the torch created by EMI, and the magnesium candle supplied by Wessex Aircraft Engineering. Neither the suppliers nor designer charged a fee for the final torch.|$|E
5|$|Also {{known as}} a {{manifold}} cage or regulator cage, this is a structure which can be clamped to {{the neck of the}} cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the valves and regulator first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the handwheel against an overhead. A valve cage is often made of <b>stainless</b> steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{employer}} {{in the town}} is Metalcraft (<b>Stainless</b> Metalcraft (Chatteris) Ltd). The company {{was established in the}} town in the late 19th century and over the years has manufactured diamond mining equipment and overhead cranes. The company is now part of the Avingtrans Group and specialises in creating engineered products for the oil, gas, nuclear and medical industries.|$|E
