40|$|The {{purpose of}} Skip-lot {{sampling}} {{is to reduce}} the Average Sample Number (ASN) and Average Total Inspection (ATI) as well as inspection costs. The Skip-lot concept is economically advantageous to make decision on the submitted lot. This paper presents the comparison of <b>skip</b> <b>lot</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> SkSP- 2 and SkSP-V in terms of Probability Accepting, (Pa), Average Outgoing Quality (AOQ), ASN, ATI and also cost reduction. The results indicated that SkSP- 2 and SkSP-V were not significant different on the Pa and AOQ. However, SkSP-V gave lowest cost significantly both from ASN and ATI. This property shows the advantage of SkSP-V for the lowest cost inspection but SkSP- 2 for easier implementation because of the smaller parameters in actual operation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the continuous <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> CSP- 100 {{that was developed}} from the continuous <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> CSP- 1, CSP- 4 and CSP-C. The objective {{of this paper is}} to apply the continuous <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> for the new CSP- 100 plan proving a reduction in the delivery inspection time compared to the single <b>lot</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> (SSP) while maintaining the same or greater quality conformance. This CSP- 100 was studied in Hard Disc Drive manufacturing. The parameters used in the CSP- 100 plan are as follows; i (the number of consecutive conforming units), f (the sampling frequency of partial number in 100 % inspected units) and c (the acceptance number). CSP- 100 computes four performance measures, Average Fraction Inspected (AFI), Average Outgoing Quality (AOQ), Lot Acceptance Rate (LAR) and Defective Parts Per Million (DPPM). The advantage of this CSP- 100 plan is not only to reduce the inspection time but also prove higher productivity numbers when compared with SSP. The verified results of using the CSP- 100 plan proved a reduced inspection time of 6, 722, 702 minutes or 15 % compared to SSP. CSP- 100 also eliminates the work stations and transportation processes due to the inspection area and inspectors are no longer required. The Function Out of Box Audit (FOBA) is introduced to monitor the CSP- 100 performance. The FOBA audit results confirm that the CSP- 100 maintains the same good quality level as the SSP. The excellent results of implementing the CSP- 100 show a reduction in the inspection cost by 3, 693, 730. 04 baht or 60. 40 % compared to SSP, as well as the additional cost savings by no longer needing to purchase a new tester; a savings of ~ 44 million baht. The CSP- 100 plan also eliminates the issue of delayed delivery that is part of the SSP process. Moreover it is a better choice in inspecting the continuous quality process in Hard Disc Drive manufacturing...|$|R

These statistical methods are first explained from a theoretical point of view. Then, each one is illustrated by a practical application to a <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> validation for a specific chemical risk in a food commodity, thanks to workable contamination data gathered in the literature. According to us, in its general mathematical principle, the non parametric method is more appropriate to cases with contaminants distributed heterogeneously in a food lot. However, due to its ease of use, the parametric method applies best to cases where the distribution of the contaminant is homogeneous. A food contaminant is homogeneously distributed in a contaminated food lot when the contamination incidence rate for individual food items taken from the contaminated lot is high, and when the concentration levels in each food item are rather alike. Otherwise, when the contamination incidence rate is low, and when the concentrations differ greatly in each food item, this means that the contaminant is heterogeneously distributed within the food lot. For these reasons, the first <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> validation technique (parametric method) is applied, in this chapter, to phycotoxin contamination in shellfish lots at the cultivation zone, as it is considered as being a homogeneously distributed contaminant case. For the heterogeneously distributed contaminant case, mycotoxin contamination data for pistachios at retail stage are exploited in order to put into practice the non-parametric <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> validation method. Both phycotoxins and mycotoxins are natural toxins that are unsafe for human. Limits of contaminations are set by national and international safety agencies, but sampling strategies have a great influence on the detected results in food lots. The chapter will show that an optimal sampling strategy can be obtained in each of the two cases, but that they require different mathematical approaches in order to obtain reliable Operating Characteristics (OC) curves showing: - the consumer risk (risk of accepting lots at a true concentration above the contaminant's concentration threshold); - the producer risk (risk of rejecting lots at a true concentration under the contaminant's concentration threshold) ...|$|R
