500|$|The early {{benchmark}} {{time was}} set by Daniel Oss (...) , {{who completed the}} course in 6' 08". A good time was also set by Peter Sagan (...) , whose time was 6' 10" [...] and who was the best young rider in the prologue. Sagan did well to set <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time,</b> since he hit a pavement early in his ride and nearly fell. Oss kept the lead for a long time, but was eventually overtaken by Matthias Brändle (...) [...] Brändle, however, was immediately overtaken by Adriano Malori (...) , the Italian national time trial champion, who had two previous stage wins in Tirreno–Adriatico time trials. Malori's time was 6' 04". Maciej Bodnar (...) , Steve Cummings (...) and Greg Van Avermaet (...) all came close to Malori's time, but were unable to beat it. The principal favourite for the stage, former world time trial champion Fabian Cancellara (...) , finished one second behind Malori, who therefore won the stage, winning both the blue jersey of the overall leader of the race and the red jersey of the points classification leader.|$|E

"We were {{so pleased}} with the {{reception}} of the movie that we said, 'Maybe there's a one-hour show (here),'" [...] said Allen Sabinson, A's {{senior vice president for}} programming, in June 2000. [...] "I don't believe we were thinking, or Maury Chaykin and Timothy Hutton were thinking, there's a series here. These are not people who do series.

I build a simple model where managers {{are prone to}} over invest and where shareholders {{are more willing to}} tolerate <b>such</b> <b>a</b> behavior in <b>good</b> <b>times.</b> The model successfully explains the average profit differences as well as the cyclical behavior of sales, employment and investment for firms with different governance qualities. The quantitative results suggest that governance conflicts can explain 30 % of aggregate volatility. ...|$|R
2500|$|Cheney later {{stated that}} he was trying to prove to critics that The Living End were not a band simply defined by their hit, [...] "Prisoner of Society", and the album showed this by {{displaying}} other influences, as well as their traditional fast-paced rockabilly music. Rolling Stone Jenny Eiscu compared it to The Clash's creative breakthrough, London Calling (December 1979), as they [...] "stomp all over the boundaries between punk, reggae, rockabilly and plain old rock & roll – and it still sounds like a revelation, twenty-two years after he Clash did it. The pupils don't quite outpace the masters here ... But the band is obviously having <b>such</b> <b>a</b> riotously <b>good</b> <b>time</b> that you'd be a sucker not to stomp your foot and join the party". Much of the style was comparable to 1980s hard rock and pub rock, as well as many tracks being obscure mixes of many ideas, resulting in 'procrastinating' structures. This defined the album's creativity.|$|R

During the recent Academy meetings in Honolulu, we individually participated in many symposia and consortia focusing on publication policies at AMJ and other journals. In comparing notes, we realized that there is considerable overlap among the questions asked and explored during these various sessions. In addition, we realized that we have made a number of recent changes to Journal policies and operations that are not yet widely recognized. <b>As</b> <b>such,</b> it seems <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to touch base with readers, reviewers...|$|R
5000|$|Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B, criticizing the main plot's {{lack of a}} clearly defined central conflict. However, Wilkins found the episode enjoyable, stating, [...] "'Midday Run' is <b>such</b> <b>a</b> rollicking <b>good</b> <b>time</b> that it almost doesn’t matter {{how much of a}} mess it is. Building a story around Tina as a hall monitor gone rogue is all sorts of genius, {{and there are plenty of}} terrific laughs to be had from the lengths Tina goes to in her quest to find Zeke, but where the story falters {{somewhat}} is in figuring out just what the actual conflict is here." [...] By contrast, Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode a 9.2 out of 10, stating, [...] "The return of Bob’s Burgers after a far-too-long hiatus was welcome this week, but it felt even more so with a half-hour that managed to get funnier and funnier as it went along, and was capped off by a great closing moment with the family. And any episode that focuses on the travails of Tina tends to be a near-classic." ...|$|R
