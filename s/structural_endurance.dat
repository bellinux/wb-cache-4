There is a broad range of things that can fall into this category. Previous examples include laboratories such as the Mars Science Laboratory, sampling techniques, the Mars rovers, the Titan lander (Huygens), and submersibles. Autonomous systems are preferred because data can be collected without the presence of humans near the test area. The field campaigns are used as a proof-of-concept for the proposed technologies as well as a demonstration. They are generally tested with mock-mission where conditions and challenges simulate those that might be experienced on an actual mission. This helps identify their strengths and weaknesses in the technology’s mission execution and <b>structural</b> <b>endurance.</b>|$|E

40|$|As {{the range}} of {{applications}} for fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials in civil engineering constantly increases, there {{is more and more}} concern with regard to their performance in critical environments. The fire behavior of composite materials is especially important since complex physical and chemical processes such as the glass transition and decomposition occur when these materials are subjected to elevated and high temperatures, possibly leading to considerable loss of stiffness and strength. This stiffness and strength degradation in composite materials under elevated and high temperatures is the result of changes in polymer molecular structures. When polyester thermosets are subjected to elevated and high temperatures, they undergo three transitions (glass transition, leathery-to-rubbery transition, and rubbery-to-decomposed transition), corresponding to four different states (glassy, leathery, rubbery and decomposed). At a certain temperature, a composite material can therefore be considered as a mixture of materials that are in different states. As the content of each state varies with temperature, the composite material exhibits temperature-dependent properties. Since these changes in state can be described using kinetic theory, the quantity of material in each state can be estimated and the thermophysical and thermomechanical properties of the mixture can thus be determined. These concepts formed a basis for the development of thermophysical and thermomechanical property sub-models for composites at elevated and high temperatures and even for the description of post-fire status. Incorporating these thermophysical property sub-models into a heat transfer governing equation, thermal responses were calculated using a finite difference method. Integrating the thermomechanical property sub-models within structural theory, the mechanical responses were described using a finite element method and the time-to-failure was also predicted by defining a failure criterion. The modeling results for temperature responses, mechanical responses and post-fire behavior were compared with those obtained from <b>structural</b> <b>endurance</b> experiments on full-scale cellular GFRP (glass fiber-reinforced polymer, in this case polyester resin) panels subjected to a four-point bending configuration and fire from one side. The modeling results for time-to-failure were compared with those from the experiments carried out on GFRP tubes under combined compressive and thermal loadings. In each experimental setup, two different thermal boundary conditions were investigated – with and without water cooling through specimen cells – and good agreement was found. The understanding gained and modeling of the behavior of GFRP composites under elevated and high temperatures carried out in this thesis could be applicable for different composite materials, and also benefit investigations regarding both active and passive fire protection techniques in order to improve the fire resistance of structures made of such materials...|$|E

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{begins as}} a response to the socio-economic and environmental crisis that followed Hurricane Katrina. Inspired by a call for “nonsovereign” histories of the storm, I view these twinned crises through a postcolonial lens and consider the category of the nation inadequate to the task of accounting for what happened in New Orleans. With firm roots in Literature, my method is informed by the hemispheric school of American Studies, which pushes the city beyond its regional confines in the U. S. South and reframes it in relation to a number of different scales: the Caribbean, the Atlantic World, Latin(a) America, the Global South. While these frames capture a fuller portion of New Orleans’s complex history, they tend to focus on the city’s vital relationship to other places, what geographers call its “situation,” and to overlook its “site,” the actual wetlands terrain it occupies. Because such approaches foreground social and economic concerns, the environment remains an abstract landscape: culture is separated from nature, and the historical connection between the two falls out of the picture. As sites of cultural contact in tension with the nation, as well as these other geopolitical scales, wetlands merge this separation and bring an ecocritical dimension to the hemispheric studies project. While tracing an ongoing entanglement of nature and culture, I argue for the historical place of wetlands in understanding the racial and economic disparity revealed in the flood caused by Katrina. 	My project centers on New Orleans, but the settlement of Louisiana and the lower Mississippi River Valley offers a broader case study for mapping the diverse and overlapping literatures that shaped this history. Within these real and imagined American geographies, I examine the material and discursive practices through which swamps and other wetlands landscapes became entangled with concepts of race as part of the same colonial processes. My study begins at the end of the nineteenth century, in the New Orleans of Lafcadio Hearn and George Washington Cable. As I explore the place of environment in their works, set amid the culture clash following the Louisiana Purchase, I argue that the wetlands and the tropics, as postcolonial creole spaces, reemerge periodically to disrupt the inevitable progress of the nation. Returning to colonial Louisiana, I then trace the emergence of the wetlands as a category of knowledge through a series of encounters with ciénagas, swamps, and marais. In a network of early American texts and translations, including El Inca Garcilaso, William Bartram, and Chateaubriand, I consider how discourses of race and landscape coincided across a range of narrative forms. With attention to the <b>structural</b> <b>endurance</b> of Louisiana’s plantation system and a reconsideration of the figure of the slave in the swamp, I conclude in the nineteenth-century U. S. with the works of Harriet Beecher Stowe, Solomon Northup, and Martin Delany. In the light of this long view, the post-Katrina present does not represent a rupture of the U. S. national narrative. Rather, when embedded within the life of the wetlands, marked by periodic returns to mud and water, it is a moment continuous with an uneven, hemispheric history of the Americas...|$|E
40|$|Fiber-reinforced {{synthetic}} polymers (FRP) are {{the building}} materials that may permit both {{the improvement of}} long-term building performance and the simplification of the construction process. Thanks to their high specific strength, low thermal conductivity, good environmental resistance, {{and their ability to}} be formed into complex shapes, FRP materials are well-suited to fulfilling many building functions. By integrating traditionally separate building systems and layers into single function-integrated components and industrially fabricating those components, the amount of on-site labor can be greatly reduced and overall quality can be improved. In order to profit from the advantageous qualities of FRP, however, it is essential to address the unique weaknesses and disadvantages of the material. Most notably, the problems of poor fire safety and high material costs must be overcome. In response to these challenges, a new multiple-story building system employing FRP materials is proposed. Within this system, fire safety is ensured through the use of an internal liquid cooling system, which circulates a cooling medium through the load-bearing FRP elements to maintain their temperature within a safe operating range. This system is made cost-effective through the integration of the building's heating and cooling system. By controlling the temperature of the circulating liquid, the building's structural elements can serve as heating or cooling emitters (radiators). Further, the addition of the liquid within the cells of the FRP elements helps maintain a more constant interior climate through the "thermal flywheel" effect, which improves energy efficiency and comfort. Experimental investigations were performed to explore the fire safety aspects of the proposed system. An existing FRP cellular bridge deck material was adapted to incorporate an internal liquid cooling system. After several preliminary investigations, large-scale experiments involving structural and fire loading were conducted on both liquid-cooled and non-liquid cooled specimens. The experiments demonstrated the efficacy of the system in protecting load-bearing FRP elements from the weakening effects of high temperatures, especially those that are stressed in compression. <b>Structural</b> fire <b>endurance</b> times were improved from less than one hour to more than two hours (EC 1 Part 1. 2) through the implementation of the liquid cooling system. Alongside the experimental program, a series of mathematical models were developed. Numerical thermochemical and thermomechanical models simulate the response of loaded liquid-cooled FRP panels in fire, while analytical models predict the post-fire mechanical behavior of fire-damaged sections. All models provide predictions that are within 10 % of experimentally measured values...|$|R
40|$|We present {{observations}} and models that together explain many hallmarks {{of the structure}} and growth of small impact craters forming in targets with aligned fractures. Endurance Crater at Meridiani Planum on Mars (diameter ≈ 150 m) formed in horizontally-layered aeolian sandstones with a prominent set of wide, orthogonal joints. A <b>structural</b> model of <b>Endurance</b> Crater is assembled and used to estimate the transient crater planform. The model is based on observations from the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity: (a) bedding plane orientations and layer thicknesses measured from stereo image pairs; (b) a digital elevation model of the whole crater at 0. 3 m resolution; and (c) color image panoramas of the upper crater walls. This model implies that the crater’s current shape was mostly determined by highly asymmetric excavation rather than long-term wind-mediated erosion. We show that modal azimuths of conjugate fractures in the surrounding rocks are aligned with the square component of the present-day crater planform, suggesting excavation was carried farther {{in the direction of}} fracture alignments. This was previously observed at Barringer Crater in Arizona and we show the same relationship also holds for Tswaing Crater in South Africa. We present models of crater growth in which excavation creates a “stellate” transient cavity that is concave–cuspate in planform. These models reproduce the “lenticular-crescentic” layering pattern in the walls of some polygonal impact craters such as Endurance and Barringer Craters, and suggest a common origin for tear faults and some crater rays. We also demonstrate a method for detailed error analysis of stereogrammetric measurements of bedding plane orientations...|$|R
40|$|Today {{customers}} want to {{have added}} value when buying new products. To obtain added value the product has to give the customer something positive that was not expected. The question for companies becomes to identify the real customer need for added value and then bring these into properties and functions to offer the customers. Volvo Aero Corporation has {{recognized the importance of}} added value and tries to find their way to a successful solution. “By creating value for our customers, we create value for our shareholders. ” One of the Volvo Group’s mission statements In this thesis it is investigated if there are possibilities to work with a functional approach instead of traditional design principles and product definitions. Another issue is to see what properties must be represented in a concept design model in order to evaluate concepts in consideration of added value. One way to increase the added value is to increase the contents of the product. Besides the contents of the product shorter lead-time and greater flexibility can be a way for increasing the added value. Contents of the product do not only need to be more or less hardware features, it can consist of leasing offers and services like education, support and maintenance. Companies need to offer all this to be successful and create a win-win situation. Taking a functional perspective on products makes it is possible to think wider in the creative concept phase. A functional break down divides the problem into smaller areas and makes it easier to find new types of means (solutions) to solve the function requirement. When the means realize the functions it is also easier to see new means or change old on existing concepts. The functional way of thinking can be applied on both hardware and service. A functional brake down is described here for an intermediate case (IMC), a component in a jet-engine. For a functional break down it is important to see the problem from an abstract point of view and then formulate the problem. It is then possible to transform the problem formulation to an overall function that can be broken down into sub-functions. The IMC is a static component and {{is a part of the}} “skeleton” in a jet engine. An abstract problem formulation for the IMC can be: “Support surrounding parts, keep two air flows separated and transfer the thrust from the engine to the airframe. ” Abstract formulation of the Intermediate case tasks In this thesis a functional break down is used to define a modular representation of the IMC. The modular representation can then be used in the creation of the product structure. Besides the hardware it is useful to describe properties of product that match different types of costs, maintenance requirements, weight, <b>structural</b> stiffness, <b>endurance</b> etc. in a concept design model. The properties are used to do the important evaluation process for picking the best concept. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of five studies relating impact processes {{to the evolution}} of planetary interiors as well as impact structures on planetary surfaces. Chapter 2 is concerned with developing methods for estimating the amount of heat deposited deep in terrestrial mantles by large impacts. Chapter 3 makes use of these results to compute the consequences of impact-related thermal buoyancy perturbations in numerical models of subsolidus convection. Among the important results of this work is a relation for the time-scale on which a buoyancy anomaly flattens and spreads before it is halted by convective downflows, as well as a condition that indicates for what perturbation magnitudes and Rayleigh numbers the flow is significantly slowed at a global scale. Chapter 4 describes a <b>structural</b> model of <b>Endurance</b> Crater in Meridiani Planum on Mars, which is constrained by observations gathered by the MER-B Opportunity rover. These results reveal new insights about the planform shape of the crater excavation flow, as well as the connection between crater shape and pre-existing structures in target materials. The study presented in chapter 5 relates the planimetric shape of simple impact craters on Mars (D < 5 km) to the geological targets in which they form, as well as rim diameter. Planform crater shape is characterized by a suite of morphometric parameters, including Fourier harmonic amplitudes and phase angles, as well as measures of deviation from radial symmetry and convexity. (cont.) In addition to finding the morphometric dependence on target properties, this work has illuminated prominent transitions between different cratering regimes, and contains a measure of the global distribution of planform elongation azimuths - which may relate to impact azimuth and provide an estimate of Mars' past obliquity variations. Finally, Chapter 6 describes a stochastic-kinematic model of the interaction between the excavation front and fractures in the target, which replicates many of the observations obtained in Chapter 5. by Wesley Andrés Watters.

40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2016 Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2016 Son yılardaki hızlı teknolojik gelişmeler hemen hemen bütün mesleki pratiklerin işleyişini ve algılanışını etkilemiştir. Bu değişimlerle birlikte, mimarlık pratiği ve mimarın rolü de radikal bir biçimde evrilmiştir. Hızlı teknolojik gelişmeler ve bilişim teknolojilerinin kullanımının yaygınlaşması ile dijital araçlar ve teknikler tasarımcının rolünü belirleyici birer faktör haline gelmiştir. Bilişim araçları, mimarın tasarım sürecinin ve tasarıma bakış açısının derin bir biçimde değişmesine sebep olmuştur. Vitruvius De architectura libri decem kitabında mimarlığın üç temel niteliğini firmitas(sağlamlık), utilitas(kullanışlılık), venustas(estetik) olarak tanımlamıştır (Rowland ve Howe, 1999). Daha sonraki mimarlık kuramcıları, mimarlığın analizi, değerlendirilmesi, anlamının tartışılması ve eleştirilmesi adına farklı yöntemler ortaya koysalar bile, Vitrivius'un tanımı günümüzde hala mimari ürünün eleştirilmesi ve incelenmesi adına geçerli bir temel sağlamaktadır. Buna rağmen, günümüz mimari tasarım pratiğinde, mimarların ve mühendislerin rolü keskin bir biçimde ayrılmıştır. Mimar, yapının biçim ve fonksiyon ("untilitas", "venustas") gibi özelliklerinden sorumlu hale gelirken, mühendis matematiksel "firmitas" sorumluluğunu üstlenmiştir. Günümüz mimarlık pratiğinde bilişim teknolojileri tasarımda önemli bir rol oynamalarına rağmen, performans verilerin tasarım süreci içerisinde düşünülmesi henüz yeterince yaygın bir anlayış değildir. Performans ve tasarımın ilişkisi, çoğunlukla bitmiş bir tasarım ürününün performansının bilişim araçları ile değerlendirilmesi şeklinde olmaktadır. Performansın geometrik olmayan yönlerini (ekonomik, çevresel, strüktürel vb.) henüz tasarıma dair kesin kararlar alınmamışken değerlendirmek, tasarım alternatiflerini ve sonuç ürünü etkileyip, tasarım sürecini değiştirebilir. Ayrıca, farklı disiplinlere ait bilgilerin entegre edildiği tasarım süreçleri, karmaşık problemlere getirilecek çözümleri daha tatminkâr hale getirebilmektedir. Bilişim araçlarının ayrışmış disiplinlere ait bilgileri bir araya getirmek amacıyla kullanılması, tasarım sürecindeki yaratıcılığı ve yenilikçiliği arttırarak süreci daha üretken bir hale getirebilir. Performansa dair değerlendirmelerin temel düzeyde bir hâkimiyetle tasarımcı tarafından tasarım süreci ile eş zamanlı ve küçük iterasyonlar ile yapılması, performansı biten bir ürünün değerlendirilmesi olmaktan ziyade tasarım kararlarını yönlendirici bir boyut olarak ele almayı sağlayarak bütünleşik süreçleri destekleyecektir. Tüm bu tartışmalar ve incelemeler ışığında ortaya bir sentez koyularak, var olan bilişim araçları kullanılarak bütünleşik bir tasarım önerisi yapılmıştır. Bu öneri anlatılanların sentez bir modeli olacak şekilde kurgulanmıştır. Ortaya koyulan sentez ile bilişim araçlarının ve farklı disiplinlere ait bilgilerin tasarım süreçlerine dahil edilmesi yaklaşımı, daha yaratıcı ve yenilikçi ürünlerin oluşturulmasına katkı sağlamakta ve süreçlerin üretkenliğini güçlendirmektedir. Öte yandan bütünleşik tasarım süreçleri, karmaşık karakteristik gösteren tasarım problemlerine getirilecek önerilerin üretilmesinde de avantajlı konuma geçmektedirler. In recent years, rapid {{technological}} advances {{have affected the}} operation and perception of almost all professions. With these changes, the practice of architecture and the architect's role have evolved radically too. The expansion of digital devices with rapid technological developments {{and the use of}} information technologies and techniques has become a factor determining the role of the designers. Digital tools has led to a profound change in design process and in the architect's point of view for design. Vitruvius defines the three basic qualities of architecture in the book De architectura libri decem as firmitas (durability), utilitas (usability), venustas (aesthetics) (Rowland and Howe, 1999). Even though architectural theorists exert their different ways on criticisms and evaluation of architecture, Vitruvius definition still provide a valid basis today on behalf of criticism and examination of architectural products. However, in the current practice of architectural design, the role of architects and engineers are sharply separated. Architects became responsible for features such as, building function and form ("untilitas", "venustas") while engineers were taking the mathematical "firmitas" responsibility. Despite the fact that information technology {{play an important role in}} today's architectural design practice, the use of building performance data in the early stages of design process is not yet common. The relationship between performance and design is mostly in the form of using digital tools to evaluate the performance of a finished design product. However, using the non-geometric aspects of performance (economic, environmental, structural, etc.) in the early stages of design process may affect design alternatives and the final product may by altering the design process. In addition, the design process that integrates information of different disciplines can provide more satisfactory solutions to complex problems. The use of digital tools to bring together the information that belongs to disciplines may increase creativity and innovation in the design process and can make it more productive. Assessment of performance concurrently with the design process by designers with the basic knowledge of performance evaluation with small iterations makes the term performance the router design decisions rather than evaluator of a finished end product. The concept of the performance is seen to comprise a wide meaning in the literature. The main objective of building performance is defined by American Association of Architects (AIA) as : "To ensure the efficiency of buildings with functional and environmental characteristics; such as thermal, atmospheric, acoustic and visual quality etc. [ [...] . ] the integrity of the building and to provide organizational effectiveness; flexibility, <b>endurance,</b> <b>structural</b> and fire safety, [ [...] . ] to ensure equitable resource use efficiency and ensure compliance with the urban fabric and the built environment; materials, land, water, energy, waste, infrastructure and so on. Performance concept is a basic issue of contemporary architectural theory and practice. Building performance and behavior of designer can be important forces in the design process and cannot be considered as a duty to be applied later on. Performance-Based Design can be defined as a design paradigm whose primary objective is to meet functional, environmental, safety, and structural, financial vs. requirements of building performance. Digital tools such as optimization and simulation tools etc. are the main design tools. Generative Design on the other hand, can create a variety of design solutions thanks to algorithmic and rules-based processes. Cellular automata, L-systems, shape grammars and generative design systems are used as main design methods and used as a form finding method. Recently, there appears a new design paradigm called Performance-based Generative Design. As the name suggests, it involves the two design paradigms that previously mentioned. In Performance-based Generative Design, both building performance and form are the governing factors of design development. Indeed, Performance-based Generative Design is a design paradigm which benefits from the guidance of performance data across different disciplines, digital tools, generative systems, simulation techniques and optimization algorithms. However, it is quite obvious by examining the results of the work in this area that reducing performance goals to a single discipline is a common attitude to Performance-based Design. An integrated design approach that addresses integrated multiple building performances from different disciplines can fill this gap. In this case, Generative Performance-based Design approach is required to be evaluated as Generative Performance-based Integrated Design. The relationship between form and building performance may be in different ways. It has been one of the main issues of architectural theory and practice throughout history. This discussion is based on the fact that architectural design is both science and art. Consequently, design must meet both aesthetic and functional requirements. In this thesis, the term "integrated" is taken not as a geometric representation of an object alone. On the contrary, the term targets integral design solutions and addresses form and performance duality which turns to be a synergy through multiple effects and behaviors. An alternative design approach to deal with multiple building performances is recommended. More specifically, integrated design is viewed in terms of both of discovery forms and analysis of building systems simultaneously in the early stages of design to meet the performance and efficiency criteria from different disciplines. The use of integrated design approach is believed to be potential benefits too. For example, the net increase was in the number of design scenarios and alternatives, improve the overall design concept, suggesting the emergence of a multi-disciplinary cooperation, reduction of iterations in the design cycle can be some of them. In addition, Integrated Performance Based Design can help to reach new levels complexity and provide emergence possibilities. The potential benefits should not lead to the conclusion that this approach has no difficulties or weaknesses. Actually, many changes may be needed for the fulfillment of an integrated design approach. However, the problem and the hypotheses are envisaged within the scope of this thesis as described below. Problem: The relationship between performance and design occurs as in the form of evaluating the performance of a finished product design as a common attitude. Hypothesis: There is a need for a design environment in which all aspects of performance are needed to be evaluated (by using digital tools) in the early stages of the design process. Performance evaluation of design decisions (predominant in basic level) without the need for a third expert, with small iterations will enable an integrated design processes and richer design cluster. Thinking the term performance not as an evaluator of already finished process, but as a router design evolution can affect design decisions by showing the designers different results. In this study, firstly the decomposition of different disciplines, and reintegration efforts in the era of information and technology and the changing forms of interaction between designer and design as a result of introduction of digital tools into the design concept were discussed. Next, contemporary approaches to Performance-based Design and performance strategies of designers are examined through the designer's project in Performance-based Design literature between the years 2010 - 2015. The three basic questions asked to the examples are as follows: What are the project's design goals? How they use digital tools to evaluate the performance? How performance-design process relationship is handled? In this chapter, "performance-process-tools" have been discussed. An integrated design proposal is put forward using existing digital tools in the light of a synthesis of all these discussions and investigations. Synthesis of this proposal is expected to be a model for integrated performance based design process. The synthesis set forth by information from different disciplines to be included in the design process with the help of digital tools and approaches, led to the creation of more creative and innovative products, strengthen the productivity of the process and support an integrated design process. Additionally, integrated design processes take the advantageous position in the production of proposals brought to complex design problems. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
