50|$|Some prisoners being transported from custody {{to outside}} locations, for {{appearances}} at court, to medical facilities, etc., will wear handcuffs augmented with a belly chain.

When the handcuffs are concealed by a handcuff cover and secured at the prisoner's waist by a belly chain, this combination will result in a rather more severe restraint and the restrained person may feel discomfort or even pain.|$|E
