5|$|To do this, Rincewind is told to {{discover}} who they are, and recover a golden item from each, since these items {{are what they}} use to control the dragon. Learning that a book about <b>summoning</b> dragons had been stolen from the library at Unseen University the night before, Rincewind gains access to L-Space, allowing him to journey into the past, witness the theft, and follow the thief back to the brotherhood's hideout. After gaining entry in disguise, Rincewind learns that each member holds {{a role in the}} city — Chucky the Fool, the Thief, the Mason, the Chimney Sweep, the Fishmonger, and the Dunny King — and seeks to change the city so they can have a better future for themselves. Acquiring their golden items, Rincewind brings them to the dragon, only to learn it will not return to its dimension but seek revenge on the brotherhood before coming after him. Wishing to stop this, Rincewind decides to prevent the <b>summoning</b> book from being stolen, by switching it for one that makes love custard. In his efforts to be recognised for stopping the dragon, Rincewind gets into an argument with the Patrician over the existence of dragons, <b>summoning</b> the very same one back to Discworld. An annoyed Patrician tasks Rincewind to deal with it.|$|E
5|$|Torn was {{to contain}} {{four types of}} magic: Chaos, Order, Alchemy and <b>Summoning.</b> Order magic {{primarily}} consisted of healing, protective, and empowering spells. Conversely, Chaos magic was to have consisted of harmful elemental attacks, detrimental status afflictions, and invisibility spells.|$|E

50|$|A simple <b>summons</b> is a {{document}} which contains the basis (the particulars of the claim) for the plaintiff's {{action in the}} body of the <b>summons.</b> The simple <b>summons</b> is the High Court equivalent of the ordinary <b>summons</b> in the Magistrate's Court. A combined <b>summons,</b> on the other hand, has a more detailed and separate document containing the particulars of claim and is annexed to the <b>summons.</b> As a general rule, the simple <b>summons</b> is used where the claim is for a debt or a liquidated demand. There are certain matters for which a combined <b>summons</b> is prescribed: for example, in divorce matters. In the High Court, however, it is customary only to use a simple <b>summons</b> when one is certain that it is appropriate to do so.|$|R
50|$|<b>Summon</b> (Samon): <b>Summons</b> {{either the}} Gosei Headders, Gosei Weapons, Gosei Machines, Gosei Wonder or Gosei Ultimate. There is a <b>Summon</b> Card for each Gosei Weapon, Gosei Headder, Gosei Machine, and Brother set (there is one Seaick Brother <b>Summon</b> Card for Gosei Blue and two Landick and Skick Brother <b>Summon</b> Cards each for the Landick and Skick Goseigers respectively).|$|R
5|$|At dawn on May23, the Cabildo {{informed}} {{the population that}} the Viceroy would end his mandate. The highest authority would be transferred temporarily to the Cabildo until {{the appointment of a}} governing junta. Notices were placed at various points throughout the city, which announced the imminent creation of a junta and the <b>summoning</b> of representatives from the provinces. The notices also called for the public to refrain from actions contrary to public policy.|$|E
5|$|District constable was {{powerless}} {{to stop the}} violence. In the 1840s, most suburban districts of Philadelphia were policed by elected constables and part-time watchmen. When violence erupted in a district, the time-consuming process involved the constable <b>summoning</b> the county sheriff, who would organize a posse. During the May 6 violence, the posse arrived armed only with clubs and was {{powerless to}} do anything.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} can summon a specific Eidolon into battle. These summoned creatures include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is summoned, the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, {{in which the}} Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the <b>summoning</b> character rides them.|$|E
50|$|Apart from {{individual}} classes, players {{can take advantage}} of <b>summons</b> during battle. <b>Summons</b> typically have one primary strength that make them important on the battlefield. All <b>summons</b> cost crystals and/or items, and most have a form of prerequisite. <b>Summons</b> are much larger than typical players and are displayed on the mini-map differently, making them easy to spot on the battlefield. Killing a <b>summons</b> deals more damage to the keep than killing an infantry.|$|R
50|$|Other Marvel heroes can be <b>summoned</b> by {{collecting}} appropriate items hidden within certain levels. The {{locations of the}} power-ups necessary to <b>summon</b> aid are set. Depending on which character <b>summoned</b> them, the <b>summoned</b> heroes may help out in different ways, usually being more effective for whichever character (Spider-Man or Venom) they favor.|$|R
50|$|Familiars are companions of wizards and sorcerers. A Druid or Ranger cannot <b>summon</b> a {{familiar}}, but can <b>summon</b> an Animal Companion instead. Familiars can be <b>summoned</b> {{once per}} day. Multiclass ranger/druid with arcane user can <b>summon</b> both a familiar and an animal companion. These can be normal animals like panthers and pigs, {{but they can}} also be the strange creatures (Imps, Mephits, pixies, giant spiders, eyeballs, small dragons, etc.) Unlike creatures <b>summoned</b> by arcane or divine spell (Elementals, Planar Allies, Undead...), familiars do not unsummon while player is resting. They remain <b>summoned</b> until they are killed or unsummoned by player. When familiar is killed, his summoner receives some damage but he can <b>summon</b> new familiar, if he rested before combat.|$|R
5|$|Manlius {{started his}} war {{preparation}} by <b>summoning</b> the Pergamese to help. However, the King of Pergamum, Eumenes II, was in Rome so his brother, Attalus, who was serving as regent, took {{command of the}} Pergamese army. He joined the Roman army {{a few days later}} with 1,000 infantry and 500 cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Methods of <b>summoning</b> (e.g. telephone) and {{dispatching}} ambulances usually rely {{on electronic}} equipment, which itself often relies on an intact power grid. Similarly, modern ambulances {{are equipped with}} two-way radios or cellular telephones {{to enable them to}} contact hospitals, either to notify the appropriate hospital of the ambulance's pending arrival, or, in cases where physicians do not form part of the ambulance's crew, to confer with a physician for medical oversight.|$|E
5|$|Several episcopalians, {{supporters}} of the existing system of bishops, were {{also included in the}} <b>summoning</b> ordinance, but Parliament may have nominated them to lend greater legitimacy to the Assembly and not have expected them to attend because Charles had not approved of the Assembly. Only one, Daniel Featley, participated, and he only until his arrest for treason in October 1643.|$|E
50|$|For a character/general to be {{successfully}} <b>summoned,</b> the player must discard {{an equal number}} of hand cards as the <b>summon</b> cost of the character. All characters are <b>summoned</b> within own city/fortress unless stated. A character <b>summoned</b> on this turn cannot attack or move until the next turn unless stated otherwise(they still can activate special effects/特效 though).|$|R
5000|$|A civil <b>summons</b> is {{most often}} {{accompanied}} by a complaint. Depending {{on the type of}} <b>summons,</b> there is often an option to endorse a <b>summons</b> so that the entity being served may be identified. In the court system in California, for civil unlimited cases in the superior court, a <b>summons</b> will often have these options to endorse: ...|$|R
50|$|The Crown, as fount of honour, has the undoubted {{right to}} create peerages, whether {{hereditary}} or for life. In {{the early days}} of the peerage, the Sovereign had the right to <b>summon</b> individuals to one Parliament without being bound to <b>summon</b> them again. Over time, it was established that once <b>summoned,</b> a peer would have to be <b>summoned</b> for the remainder of his life, and later, that the peer's heirs and successors would also be <b>summoned,</b> thereby firmly entrenching the hereditary principle.|$|R
5|$|The {{fire started}} at about 2:30 a.m. on Saturday, July 19, 1845, {{on the third}} floor of J. L. Van Doren, Oil Merchant and Stearin Candle Manufacturer, known as a seller of whale oil, at 34 New Street in Manhattan, and spread quickly to {{adjoining}} buildings. The City Hall alarm bell began to ring at about 3:00 a.m., <b>summoning</b> firefighters.|$|E
5|$|The game {{introduces}} a fast travel system, allowing Batman to remotely summon his plane (the Batwing) to transport him {{to other areas}} of the game world quicker than gliding or grappling could. Enemy tower installations prevent Batman from <b>summoning</b> the craft in some areas, and must be disabled to make the Batwing (not player-controlled) available. Some towers may be disabled only when the player has the necessary equipment.|$|E
5|$|The hoot is a short, soft {{call and}} is {{another form of}} contact call. It is a more {{intimate}} call than the wail and is used exclusively between small family groups or flocks. The common loon hoots to let other family or flock members know where it is. This call is often heard when the adult loon is <b>summoning</b> its chicks to feed.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wildcard}} <b>summon</b> {{that appears}} as a European dragon. A dragon cannot be manually <b>summoned.</b> An item called a Dragon's Soul is required to <b>summon</b> a dragon. Dragons are randomly <b>summoned</b> if your army is losing by a certain amount and only one can be <b>summoned</b> per 1/3 of the keep's health. If all the conditions are met, a player, upon death, may be [...] "reborn" [...] as a dragon on the spot of his death. Dragons can fly, have high health, move quickly, and do heavy damage to infantry, <b>summons,</b> and buildings. There can only be a maximum of three dragons at once.|$|R
50|$|Dire bats can be <b>summoned</b> {{by various}} spells, such as <b>Summon</b> Nature’s Ally II.|$|R
50|$|Dire boars can be <b>summoned</b> {{with various}} spells, such as <b>Summon</b> Nature’s Ally IV.|$|R
5|$|The story, {{based on}} a trilogy of science fantasy novels by Japanese author Aya Nishitani, sees Japanese high school {{students}} Akemi Nakajima and Yumiko Shirasagi combat the forces of Lucifer, unleashed by a demon <b>summoning</b> program created by Nakajima. The gameplay features first-person dungeon crawling and turn-based battles or negotiation with demons in the Famicom version, and a journey through a hostile labyrinth as Nakajima featuring real-time combat in the Telenet version.|$|E
5|$|A {{defining}} {{aspect of}} the series is the Personas, manifestations of a person's psyche. Many Personas used up to Persona 3 are inspired by Graeco-Roman mythology. In Persona 4 {{they are based on}} Japanese deities; Persona 5 uses characters inspired by popular fictional and historical outlaws. The <b>summoning</b> ritual for Personas in battle varies throughout the series: in early games, the party gains the ability to summon through a short ritual after playing a parlor game; in Persona 3, they fire a gun-like device called an Evoker at their head; in Persona 4, they summon their Personas using Tarot cards; in Persona 5, they are summoned through the characters' masks.|$|E
5|$|Akihiko is a {{third year}} student at Gekkoukan High School and {{resident}} at the Iwatodai Dormitory. He had been friends with Mitsuru since middle school and upon learning of the Shadows, he too awakened {{to the power of}} Persona and joined her cause. Belonging to the boxing team at Gekkoukan High, Akihiko is constantly training to become a stronger fighter. His Persona is Polydeuces. Midorikawa noted that the Persona <b>summoning</b> scenes were his favorite. Midorikawa's co-cast members from the Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga video game were also featured for the supporting cast of the film.|$|E
25|$|Brooklyn {{district}} attorney Kenneth P. Thompson {{had argued that}} most people don't understand how <b>summons</b> court operates, resulting in missed court dates and automatic bench warrants; that the omission {{of race and ethnicity}} information on the <b>summons</b> form should be remedied, to provide statistics of <b>summons</b> recipients; that poor access to public defenders by indigent persons in <b>summons</b> courts raises serious due process concerns; and that the city needs to overhaul its <b>summons</b> system, to handle quality-of-life infractions better and in a timely manner.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} basic <b>summons</b> in the game, {{appearing}} as an armored knight on horseback, wielding a lance. The knight is a swift <b>summon,</b> able to traverse the map with ease. Its primary function is battling other <b>summons,</b> as it deals high damage to all <b>summons</b> (including other knights). They can also serve in reconnaissance, traveling the map quickly and relaying information about troop positions. Knights deal weak damage against infantry units and buildings. Requires 30 crystals and are <b>summoned</b> from the keep.|$|R
5000|$|Dire rats can be <b>summoned</b> {{in various}} forms with spells, {{including}} <b>Summon</b> Nature's Ally I.|$|R
5|$|Although {{taken by}} surprise, Kesselring moved rapidly {{to regain control}} of the situation, <b>summoning</b> Generaloberst Eberhard von Mackensen's Fourteenth Army {{headquarters}} from northern Italy, the 29th and 90th Panzergrenadier Divisions from the Cassino front, and the 26th Panzer Division from Tenth Army. OKW chipped in some divisions from other theatres. By February, Kesselring was able to take the offensive at Anzio but his forces were unable to crush the Allied beachhead, for which Kesselring blamed himself, OKW and von Mackensen for avoidable errors.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being set}} in space, the film uses motifs from {{shipwreck}} and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience {{in the aftermath}} of a catastrophe. Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face of isolation and the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of <b>summoning</b> the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Sam finds and confronts Jeremy. The latter manipulates the dreamscape to his favor, but Sam retaliates by <b>summoning</b> {{the form}} of Jeremy's father. A terrified Jeremy is distracted, and Sam kills him with a {{baseball}} bat. The brothers then awaken from their dreams. When they find that Bela lied about Bobby saving her life, they realize that she stole the Colta mystical gun capable of killing anythingfrom them. As the brothers prepare to leave to hunt her down, Dean admits {{that he does not}} want to die. Sam promises him that they will figure out a way to save him.|$|E
50|$|<b>Summons</b> random creatures. The {{commemorative}} tenth failed spell <b>summons</b> Octo-Tim, who transforms Kukuri into Devil-Kukuri.|$|R
5000|$|Mizferac: [...] A glabrezu <b>summoned</b> by the goodly priest Cadderly for {{information}} concerning Crenshinibon.
