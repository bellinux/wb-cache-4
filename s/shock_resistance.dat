40|$|Thermal shock {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe {{conditions}} to which a refractory lining can be subjected to during its industrial application. Thus, there are several methods available for testing thermal <b>shock</b> damage <b>resistance</b> of refractories. Among them, a very common method is the quench test, which consists of quenching a hot refractory bar into water. After that a retained mechanical property is determined. Considering this, the aim of the work herein is to compare the thermal <b>shock</b> damage <b>resistance</b> between two specimen sizes among several materials. The dimensions 150 mm × 25 mm × 25 mm and 160 mm × 40 mm × 40 mm were used. The small bars are generally used for mechanical characterization in the refractory field (recommended by ASTM C 1171 - 05). The large bars, on the other hand, are a requirement of DIN 196 - 1, which regards procedures for testing cement materials. Experimental results have indicated that the thermal shock damage is bigger for the large bars, as predicted by theoretical aspects. Although the size difference between the specimens was not so big, it was possible to observe the size effect using a statistical treatment. Five different castable formulations, of which three contained eutectic aggregates, were tested.

In a strong magnetic field, with T sub e/T sub i approximately 1 and current densities typical for present Tokomaks, the plasma is stable to ion acoustic but unstable to current driven electrostatic ion cyclotron waves. Relevant characteristics of these waves are calculated and it is shown that for ion, beta greater than m sub e/m sub i, the electromagnetic ion cyclotron wave has a lower instability threshold than the electrostatic one.

40|$|Among {{different}} refractory materials, magnesium aluminate spinel is {{of great}} importance from the industrial point of view, mainly due to its excellent corrosion and thermal <b>shock</b> <b>resistances.</b> Magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl 2 O 4), the only compound forms in the MgO-Al 2 O 3 system, has the most desirable characteristics for refractory application, along with the environmental friendliness. Other than refractory there are studies for its applications as humidity sensors, transparent ceramic, anode material in aluminum cell, etc. In combination with alumina, spinel {{is of great}} importance as the refractory lining material for the steel ladles essential for iron & steel industries due to excellent corrosion and thermal <b>shock</b> <b>resistances.</b> Again in association with magnesia {{it is important for}} the burning zones and transition zones of cement rotary kilns. The major reason for this application is its better <b>resistance</b> to thermal <b>shock</b> and alkali materials, which indicates two or three times longer service lives than other basic bricks such as conventional MgO-chrome. Magnesium aluminate spinel has always an environment friendly advantage, so it has received favor from researchers, scientists and industrialists all over world. Despite all these properties and application, the magnesium aluminate spinel is not commercially successful at per due to its high cost of production. The formation of magnesium aluminate spinel from its reactant is associated with a volume expansion which hinders to obtain dense magnesium aluminate spinel in a single step firing process. The commercial synthesis process involves two stage firing process which increases the cost of production The present work focused on synthesis of magnesium aluminate spinel from commercial grade oxide using a single step sintering process. The effect of planetary milling, effect of additives like zinc Oxide, zirconium dioxide was studied. The effect of insitu generated magnesia and alumina from nitrate precursor was also studied. The sintering study was done in the temperature range 1200 - 16000 C. The phase and microstructure was studied with varying milling time and additive percentage using X-ray diffraction technique and field emission scattered electron microscopy respectively. The flexural strength and thermal shock behavior was also studied for each batch. Dense magnesium aluminate spinel was successfully produced. The planetary milling and additive were found to enhance spinellisation process at lower temperature. The density and strength was also found to improve with milling and additive incorporation. ...|$|R
