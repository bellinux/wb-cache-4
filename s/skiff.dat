5|$|Although a ferry {{had almost}} {{certainly}} {{existed at the}} site of the present-day bridge since Norman times, the earliest known crossing of the river at Richmond dates from 1439. The service was owned by the Crown, and operated by two boats, a small <b>skiff</b> for the transport of passengers and a larger boat for horses and small carts; the Twickenham Ferry, slightly upstream, was also in service from at least 1652. However, due to the steepness of the hill leading to the shore-line on the Surrey side neither ferry service was able to transport carriages or heavily laden carts, forcing them to make a very lengthy detour via Kingston Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Developed in the United States, the American Water Spaniel is the Wisconsin state dog. The breed {{originated}} in the areas along the Fox River and its tributary the Wolf River during the early 19th century. Hunters needed a dog that could work on both land and water, a versatile hunter skilled at bringing {{in a variety of}} game. Hunters also wanted a hunting dog compact enough to be transported in a small <b>skiff,</b> one that was able to withstand Wisconsin's cold water temperatures. Breeds involved {{in the creation of the}} American Water Spaniel are thought to have included the English Water Spaniel, Irish Water Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever, native Indian Dogs, the Poodle, and either the Sussex Spaniel or another type of field spaniel.|$|E

These recognised his excellence as a sportsman, and his admirable qualities as a man. The salver was inscribed with a dedication, and each piece bore an inscribed caricature of Rush at the oars of an outrigger <b>skiff.</b> The silver items {{are now in the}} collection of the Clarence River Historical Society in Grafton, New South Wales.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Skiffs</b> usually {{provide for}} one or two scullers but because they have been built to {{individual}} customer's specifications, there can be a wide variety of designs. There are <b>skiffs</b> with three or four rowing positions. <b>Skiffs</b> with more than one sculler have a seat for a coxswain who steers the boat by ropes attached to a rudder. Single scullers usually steer themselves, but some single <b>skiffs</b> allow for a cox/passenger as well. Some <b>skiffs</b> also provide for a sail to be used.|$|R

5|$|In 1901 Marble Hill House on {{the north}} bank of the Thames and the {{surrounding}} park were purchased for public use and in 1902 the footpath on the southern bank near Ham House became a public right of way by Act of Parliament resulting in increased passenger traffic in the area. In 1908 local resident Walter Hammerton began hiring out boats to leisure users from a boathouse opposite Marble Hill House, and in 1909 began to operate a regular ferry service across the river at this point using a 12-passenger clinker-built <b>skiff,</b> charging 1d per journey.|$|E
5|$|Cotters Pond {{is a small}} {{landmark}} located {{beyond a}} few mountains and hills on the southern side of NY74 {{near the end of}} Paradox Lake. Cotters Pond, by state law, is a water body that cannot be used for baitfishing. This was designated by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Shortly afterward, NY74 passes Bumbo Pond and enters the hamlet of Paradox. After leaving Paradox, NY74 turns to the southeast along the base of <b>Skiff</b> Mountain. The highway then approaches a creek that flows into Eagle Lake. NY74 crosses over Eagle Lake and runs along the base of Eagle Cliff and the shores of the lake. After leaving Eagle Lake, the highway intersects with County Route2 (CR2), the first numbered highway that NY74 encounters after US9.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the first}} years of the oil rush, high {{overland}} shipping costs drove many well owners to float their product down Oil Creek to the Allegheny River as lumber producers did. For decades, logs had been transported using man-made floods, known as pond freshets, created by successively breaking milldams along the length of the river. These freshets could carry up to 800 <b>skiffs</b> filled with crude oil downstream at once. Most <b>skiffs</b> held between [...] of oil, but one third of that leaked out of the <b>skiffs</b> before they were even launched and another third was lost by the time the <b>skiffs</b> reached Pittsburgh. Only three in five of the flimsy vessels survived the trip without being destroyed by collisions with rocks, fallen trees, or other <b>skiffs.</b>|$|R

25|$|Thames <b>skiffs</b> were {{developed}} in the 19th century primarily for leisure use by private individuals sculling themselves. The design {{was based on the}} Thames wherries and shallops that were operated by watermen as a water taxi service in London. By the late 19th century, when Jerome K. Jerome wrote of his up-river expedition in Three Men in a Boat, there were thousands of <b>skiffs</b> at places like Richmond, Kingston and Oxford. However, there are references to <b>skiffs</b> (as a result of accidents) as early as 1812 and 1824 at Oxford. In August 1815, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was taken on a <b>skiffing</b> expedition from Old Windsor to Lechlade by Charles Clairmont and Thomas Love Peacock. He subsequently settled at Marlow where he regularly <b>skiffed</b> through the locks.|$|R
5|$|Irataba {{guided the}} party into the Mohave Canyon, {{indicating}} {{the location of}} rapids and advising the Explorer pilot of convenient places to anchor while camping for the night. When they reached {{the entrance to the}} Black Canyon of the Colorado, the ship crashed against a submerged rock, throwing several men overboard, dislodging the boiler, and damaging the wheelhouse. Using their <b>skiff,</b> the crew towed the Explorer to the shore, where they camped for three days while repairing the vessel. The expedition had relied on beans and corn provided by the Mohave during the previous weeks; as their supplies dwindled they grew increasingly anxious about the arrival of a resupply pack train from Fort Yuma. Irataba volunteered to hike towards the Mohave Valley to try to locate the supplies that had been requested several days earlier. He also warned that the expedition was being watched by Paiutes.|$|E

40|$|The Pond {{has been}} home to several types of fishing boats over the years, many of them built in Branch. Throughout the years schooners, dories, <b>skiffs</b> and {{longliners}} have sat in the Pond. The schooners of Thomas Nashs prime fishing years had a longer range than was needed for early Branch residents to catch cod in the nearby waters. The size of boats decreased from schooners to dories which were rowed to the fishing grounds. Later, dories were replaced by motorized <b>skiffs.</b> <b>Skiffs</b> were replaced by longliners with a range {{similar to that of}} the old schooners...|$|R

In the sports hey days the 1940s and 1950s there were up to 10 clubs at Abbotsford, Drummoyne, Balmain, North Sydney and Double Bay.

25|$|On 7 September Brandenburg {{launched}} a Sea Lynx helicopter {{to perform a}} reconnaissance mission on a suspected <b>skiff</b> just south of Mukalla, Yemen.

An interpreter tried to convince the crew to stop, but to no avail. Then Brandenburg fired warning shots across her bow. As the boat continue undeterred, it was later known that the headquarters of Operation Atalanta authorized the German frigate to disable the <b>skiff</b> by gunfire. After the vessel was neutralized, a German Navy team from a Rigid-hulled inflatable boat {{took control of the}} crew and seized a number of weapons. One of the suspects was injured by gunfire during the incident, and later died of his wounds onboard Brandenburg while receiving medical treatment. This was the first fatality caused by the Bundeswehr in the course of Operation Atalanta. The weaponry found on board the <b>skiff</b> was later destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Competitions {{are held}} {{at a number of}} events on the River Thames between April and October.

Regatta races usually have one <b>skiff</b> against another, although three lane racing may also occur. There are a number of Trophy competitions.
