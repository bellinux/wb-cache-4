40|$|Stream channel erosion in {{the deep}} loess soils region of western Iowa causes severe damage along {{hundreds}} of miles of streams in twenty-two counties. The goal of this project was to develop information, systems, and procedures for use in making resource allocation decisions related to the protection of transportation facilities and farmland from damages caused by stream channel erosion. Section one of this report provides an introduction. Section two presents an assessment of stream channel conditions from aerial and field reconnaissance conducted in 1993 and 1994 and a classification of the streams based on a six stage model of stream channel evolution. A Geographic Information System is discussed that has been developed to store and analyze data on the stream conditions and affected infrastructure and assist in the planning of stabilization measures. Section three presents an evaluation of two methods for predicting the extent of channel degradation. Section four presents an estimate of costs associated with damages from stream channel erosion since the time of channelization until 1992. Damage to highway bridges represent the highest costs associated with channel erosion, followed by railroad bridges and right-of-way; loss of agricultural land represents the third highest cost. An estimate of costs associated with future channel erosion on western Iowa streams is also presented in section four. Section four also presents a procedure to estimate the benefits and costs of implementing <b>stream</b> <b>stabilization</b> measures.

40|$|Reduced {{ecological}} complexity, decreased water quality, {{and accelerated}} stream bank erosion are common disturbances in rivers with agriculturally dominated watersheds. Massive bank failures, increased sediment loads, and decreased riverine habitat are current {{problems in the}} agriculturally dominated Cedar River of central Nebraska. In an effort to slow erosion and prevent further ecological degradation, 20 reach scale <b>stream</b> bank <b>stabilization</b> projects were installed on the Cedar River from 2001 to 2004. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the impact of the Cedar River <b>stream</b> bank <b>stabilization</b> projects on the ecological conditions within the Cedar River. Stream bank erosion, suspended sediment load, aquatic chemistry, in-stream metabolism, riparian macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, and fish data from seven stabilized and three unstabilized reaches were monitored from the spring of 2007 through to fall of 2008 to assess the ecological condition of each site. Stabilized sites experienced significantly less stream bank erosion than unstabilized sites. Suspended sediment and dissolved nutrient concentrations general increased in the downstream direction, irrespective of treatment. Riparian macrophyte diversity and density was significantly higher at stabilized sites. Stabilized sites were found to have greater numbers of macroinvertebrate families and individuals, as well as greater numbers of the sensitive EPT families and individuals. More fish species and native fish species were captured at the stabilized sites, and a greater number of fish per m 2 were captured at the stabilized sites.

BPA now proposes to fund FWP to complete channel stabilization {{activities on the}} Lower Cleveland reach of Libby Creek, reduce sediment sources, convert overwidened portions of the stream into self-maintaining channel types, use natural <b>stream</b> <b>stabilization</b> techniques, and improve wildlife migratory corridors. This lower reach is about one river mile below the upper Cleveland Reach and the proposed activities {{are very similar to}} those conducted before. The current work would be constructed in two additional phases. The first phase of the Lower Cleveland project would be completed in the fall of 2004 (9 / 1 / 04 [...] 12 / 31 / 04), to include the upper 3, 100 feet. The second phase will be constructed in the fall of 2005 (9 / 1 / 05 [...] 12 / 31 / 05), to include stabilizing the remaining 6, 200 feet of stream. The Cleveland reaches are a spawning and rearing tributary for resident redband trout, and resident and fluvial bull trout migrating from the Kootenai River. The planned work at the two remaining phases calls for shaping cut banks; installing root wads and tree revetments; installing channel grade control structures; planting native vegetation; and installing cross vanes constructed from rock and trees to control channel gradient. In the past, this reach of Libby Creek has been degraded by past management practices, including road building, hydraulic and dredge mining, and riparian logging. This past activity has resulted in accelerated bank erosion along a number of meander bends, resulting in channel degradation and poor fish habitat. Currently the stream channel is over-widened and shallow having limited pool habitat. The current stream channel is over-widened and shallow, having limited pool habitat...|$|E

The stabilization process is pretty simple: each frame is rotated in the direction sampled by the IMU and a rectangle is cropped from the frame.
