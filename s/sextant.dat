30|$|A {{total of}} 792 <b>sextants</b> were {{included}} in this study. The numbers {{of male and female}} patients were 421 and 371, respectively. Average age was 54.3 [*]±[*] 13.3 (from 20 to 88  years old). A total of 1512 implants were installed. Implants were placed in the posterior maxilla (322 <b>sextants,</b> 40.7  %), posterior mandible (286 <b>sextants,</b> 36.1  %), anterior maxilla (127 <b>sextants,</b> 16.1  %), and anterior mandible (57 <b>sextants,</b> 7.2  %).|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 1512 {{implants}} had been placed. Male and female <b>sextants</b> were 421 and 371, respectively (M:F[*]=[*] 1 : 0.88). Average age was 54.3 (ranging from 20 to 88  years old).

Bone graft was performed in 50.3  % of the <b>sextants.</b> Among the bone grafted sites, sinus lifting with lateral approach (22.1  %) and guided bone regeneration (22.7  %) were performed most frequently.|$|R
25|$|The {{equatorial}} <b>sextant</b> is a {{navigational instrument}} {{that is used}} to get an accurate bearing and position of a ship at sea, and to take azimuths, altitude, time and declination while making observations. Also known as an altitude Instrument, the equatorial <b>sextant</b> was first invented and made by William Austin Burt. He patented it on November 4, 1856, in the United States as U.S. patent #16,002.|$|E
25|$|Accepting {{that the}} {{conflicting}} {{data in the}} typed report's flight times indeed require both northward and southward ground speeds greater than the flight's eighty-five mph airspeed, a Byrd defender posits a westerly-moving anti-cyclone that tailwind-boosted Byrd's ground speed on both outward and inward legs, allowing the distance claimed to be covered in the time claimed (the theory is based on rejecting handwritten <b>sextant</b> data in favor of typewritten alleged dead-reckoning data). This suggestion has been challenged by Dennis Rawlins who adds that the <b>sextant</b> data in the long unavailable original official typewritten report are all expressed to 1", a precision not possible on Navy sextants of 1926 and not the precision of the <b>sextant</b> data in Byrd's diary for 1925 or the 1926 flight, which was normal (half or quarter of a minute of arc).|$|E

50|$|Mural <b>sextants</b> are {{a special}} case of a mural instrument. Many were made that were {{quadrants}} rather than <b>sextants.</b> They were a kind of specialty of medieval Muslim astronomers, to whom the credit of building the first mural <b>sextants</b> is attributed.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{alveolar}} ridge dimensions between edentulous sites and contralateral dentate sites of maxillary posterior <b>sextants</b> {{in the same}} individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computerized tomography scans of 32 patients with one fully edentulous and one fully dentate maxillary posterior <b>sextants</b> were analyzed. RESULTS: When compared with dentate <b>sextants,</b> edentulous <b>sextants</b> showed (i) a lower bone height (BH) at second premolar, first molar and second molar sites, which {{was associated with a}} more coronal position of the maxillary sinus floor at second premolar site; (ii) a more apical position of the ridge at second premolar and second molar sites; (iii) a lower bone width (BW) (1 mm) at first and second premolar sites, and a lower BW(3 mm) at all sites, (iv) a lower, although not significant, prevalence of premolar and molar sites with BH ≥ 8 mm and BW(1 mm) ≥ 6 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The edentulous <b>sextants</b> in the posterior maxilla showed a reduced height and width of the ridge when compared with contralateral dentate <b>sextants.</b> The reduced vertical dimensions observed in edentulous <b>sextants</b> were variably associated with ridge resorption as well as sinus pneumatization...|$|R

The prototype F1M flew in April 1998, and CASA delivered the remainder between March 1999 and 15 March 2001. The project included a revised cockpit with colour LCDs and a Smart HUD from <b>Sextant</b> Avionique, a <b>Sextant</b> inertial navigation system with GPS interface; NATO-compatible Have Quick 2 secure communications; Mode 4 digital IFF; a defensive aids suite; and flight recorders. The radar was upgraded to Cyrano IVM standard, adding sea search and air to ground ranging modes.|$|E

25|$|The 1996 {{release of}} Byrd's diary of the May 9, 1926, flight {{revealed}} erased (but still legible) <b>sextant</b> sights that sharply differ with Byrd's later June 22 typewritten official {{report to the}} National Geographic Society. Byrd took a <b>sextant</b> reading of the Sun at 7:07:10 GCT. His erased diary record shows the apparent (observed) solar altitude to have been 19°25'30", while his later official typescript reports the same 7:07:10 apparent solar altitude to have been 18°18'18". On {{the basis of this}} and other data in the diary, Dennis Rawlins concluded that Byrd steered accurately, and flew about eighty percent of the distance to the Pole before turning back because of an engine oil leak, but later falsified his official report to support his claim of reaching the pole. Others disagree with Rawlins. In 1998, Colonel William Molett, an experienced navigator published Due north?; Molett maintained that Rawlins had put too much significance in erased navigational calculations which can be explained by any number of other reasons, including favorable wind speeds as well as simple human error due to stress and lack of sleep. None of Molett's hypotheses explain how Byrd could have observed two completely different <b>sextant</b> altitudes in the same second of time.|$|E

25|$|Polynesian {{navigation}} {{used some}} navigational instruments, which predate and are {{distinct from the}} machined metal tools used by European navigators (such as the <b>sextant,</b> first produced 1730, sea astrolabe, ~late 15th century, and marine chronometer, invented 1761). However, they also relied heavily on close observation of sea sign and {{a large body of}} knowledge from oral tradition.|$|E

25|$|In the Age of Exploration, {{from the}} 15th {{century to the}} 17th century, European cartographers both copied earlier maps (some {{of which had been}} passed down for centuries) and drew their own based on explorers' {{observations}} and new surveying techniques. The invention of the magnetic compass, telescope and <b>sextant</b> enabled increasing accuracy. In 1492, Martin Behaim, a German cartographer, made the oldest extant globe of the Earth.|$|E
50|$|In both types, larger mirrors give {{a larger}} field of view, and thus {{make it easier}} to find a {{celestial}} object. Modern <b>sextants</b> often have 5 cm or larger mirrors, while 19th-century <b>sextants</b> rarely had a mirror larger than 2.5 cm (one inch). In large part, this is because precision flat mirrors have grown less expensive to manufacture and to silver.|$|R

The filters usually consist {{of a series of}} progressively darker glasses that can be used singly or in combination to reduce haze and the sun's brightness. However, <b>sextants</b> with adjustable polarizing filters have also been manufactured, where the degree of darkness is adjusted by twisting the frame of the filter.|$|R
