50|$|Most {{implementations}} {{speed up}} searching by pre-indexing the hard drive, or the locations where the <b>search</b> has to <b>be</b> performed. So when <b>searching</b> <b>is</b> to be done, the index, {{which is a}} representation of the entire data suitable for fast <b>searching,</b> <b>is</b> used.

5|$|In August 2008, a new <b>search</b> <b>was</b> announced, {{to be led}} by Robert Grenier, {{a senior}} {{archaeologist}} with Parks Canada. This search hoped {{to take advantage of}} the improved ice conditions, using side-scan sonar from a boat in open water. Grenier also hoped to draw from newly published Inuit testimony collected by oral historian Dorothy Harley Eber. Some of Eber's informants have placed the location of one of Franklin's ships in the vicinity of the Royal Geographical Society Island, an area not searched by previous expeditions. The <b>search</b> <b>was</b> to also include local Inuit historian Louie Kamookak, who has found other significant remains of the expedition and would represent the indigenous culture.|$|E
5|$|Justice Souter joined Breyer's {{opinion in}} all respects but wrote {{separately}} to condition his support {{on the belief that}} the <b>search</b> <b>was</b> appropriate only because of the immediate danger that the evidence could have been destroyed.

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August27 but swiftly canceled {{the next day}} as Danielle steered well clear of the island. Swells from the powerful hurricane reached the East Coast of the United States, leading to the rescues of 250 people in Ocean City, Maryland and an additional 70 people {{off the coast of}} Central Florida. The body of a man—whose death appeared to have been from drowning—was pulled from the waters of Satellite Beach, Florida; a second man went missing in Ocean City, but his body was never recovered and the <b>search</b> <b>was</b> eventually called off. Researchers examining the wreckage of RMS Titanic were forced to seek refuge in St. John's, Newfoundland; swells as large as 10ft (3m) impacted the coastline of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the walls}} of the chapel were distempered over, hiding the murals from view. They were {{forgotten}} until its rediscovery in 1958. Due to their historical significance, an international <b>search</b> <b>was</b> conducted to locate the original painter in helping to restore the damaged and faded murals. Stanley was eventually found in 1959 and, after much persuasion, agreed to assist in the restoration project. He made three trips to Singapore between 1963 and 1988 to restore his former paintings. Due to Stanley's advanced age, only four of the original murals were fully restored. In the 1990s, the former site of the murals was gazetted as a Heritage Site by the National Heritage Board of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Although {{missing person}} cases are {{normally}} handled by {{local and state}} police, the FBI joined the investigation ten days after she disappeared. The FBI interviewed family from Massachusetts, and the Haverhill police chief disclosed that the <b>search</b> <b>was</b> now nationwide. Ten days after her disappearance, New Hampshire Fish and Game conducted a second ground and air search, using a helicopter with a thermal imaging camera, tracking dogs and cadaver dogs. Murray's older sister discovered a ripped white pair of women's underwear lying in the snow on a secluded trail near French Pond Road on February 26, but DNA tests found that the underwear {{did not belong to}} Murray.|$|E

5|$|An {{infinite}} loop may occur if the exit {{conditions for the}} loop are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the search has failed and must convey {{the failure of the}} search. In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, {{or in the case of}} an implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks for whether the <b>search</b> <b>was</b> successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that, in his assignment of binary search, most of the programmers who implemented binary search incorrectly made an error defining the exit conditions.|$|E
5|$|Ash died in 1887, and the United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations (now called The Association of American Orthodox Hebrew Congregations) began {{a search}} for a successor, to serve as rabbi of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol and as Chief Rabbi of New York City. This <b>search</b> <b>was</b> opposed by Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes, of Congregation Shearith Israel. Mendes felt that the money and energy would be better spent on {{supporting}} the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA), which he had co-founded with Sabato Morais in 1886. In his view, training American-born rabbis at the Seminary would be a much more effective means of fighting the growing strength of American Reform Judaism: these native English-speaking rabbis would appeal to the younger generation far more than imported, Yiddish-speaking ones.|$|E
5|$|Chester {{had planned}} to retire in June 2009, and the {{congregation}} embarked on {{a search for a}} new senior rabbi in 2008. Twenty-three candidates were narrowed down to one finalist, but in early December that individual informed the search committee that he was withdrawing his name from consideration. While the <b>search</b> <b>was</b> progressing, Chester had realized that, due to the 2008 financial crisis, he would have to keep working. After the main candidate withdrew, the synagogue's president approached Chester, asking if he would stay on for another term, which Chester agreed to do. Chester retired in June 2011, becoming (along with Broude) Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the initial}} {{announcement}} of auditions for the team, over 5,000 people applied for Clue Crew posts.

Lidskog departed the Clue Crew in 2004 {{to become an}} anchor {{on the high school}} news program Channel One News, and a <b>search</b> <b>was</b> held to replace her in early 2005. The winners were Jon Cannon and Kelly Miyahara, who formally joined the crew starting in season 22, which premiered on September 12, 2005.

5|$|Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case {{decided in}} 2001. The case {{concerned}} {{the extent of}} the government’s power to limit an individual’s complete control of his or her home pending the arrival of a search warrant. A divided Court held that the <b>search</b> <b>was</b> not unconstitutional because there was a reasonable law-enforcement need to acquire a warrant, namely, to prevent the potential destruction of evidence within the home.|$|E
5|$|In August 1958, workmen digging peat {{in an area}} of Chat Moss near Worsley {{discovered}} a severed head and called the police. It was initially believed that the head had been in the bog for less than a year, and so a <b>search</b> <b>was</b> conducted for more remains, but nothing was found. After X-rays and chemical tests, it was determined that the head had been in the bog for at least 100 years. An inquest was held into the man's death, at which the coroner returned an open verdict, and the head was put in the care of the Manchester Medical School.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A novel search {{technique}} called highway <b>search</b> <b>is</b> introduced. The <b>search</b> technique {{relies on a}} highway simulation which takes several homogeneous walks through a (possibly infinite) state space. Furthermore, we provide a memory-efficient algorithm that approximates a highway search and we prove that, under particular conditions, they coincide. The effectiveness of highway <b>search</b> <b>is</b> compared to two mainstream search techniques, viz. random search and depth-first search. Our results demonstrate that, when applied to small but complex substructures in isolation, depth-first search and highway <b>search</b> <b>are</b> orthogonal, but have equal merits, whereas overall performance of random <b>search</b> <b>is</b> poor. In contrast, experiments conducted using state spaces {{that are based on}} real systems, highway search ranks highest. The next best choice <b>is</b> a random <b>search,</b> while depth-first <b>search</b> <b>is</b> always outperformed. ...|$|R
5|$|In Okaloosa County, up to 1,267 {{residents}} {{lost power}} during the storm. Most {{of the residents}} had their power restored within a few hours; however, due to continuing wind damage, scattered power outages, affecting up to 500 homes at a time, occurred throughout the county. Throughout the county, roughly $25,000 was sustained in flood losses. A second fatality occurred after a man was knocked off his ship near the coast of Bay County. Rescuers managed to reach him but during the rescue, he fell off the life raft and was lost. The <b>search</b> <b>was</b> later called off as he was presumed dead.|$|E
