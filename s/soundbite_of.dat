5000|$|Gas Face Goat Horns - A segment that {{consists}} of Esiason and Carton placing the blame for a certain team's loss. A <b>soundbite</b> <b>of</b> Michelle Beadle saying [...] "Gas Face Horns" [...] will be played ...|$|E
5000|$|The game, {{like its}} predecessor, {{features}} humour elements. Should the computer player lay a particularly nasty , an evil laugh is heard. Taking too long over a shot will send the computer player into {{a fit of}} sarcastic coughing. A <b>soundbite</b> <b>of</b> Homer Simpson exclaiming [...] "d'oh" [...] is also heard when a player goes in-off another ball.|$|E
5000|$|Broadcasting House or BH takes itself less seriously {{than other}} Radio 4 news programmes. It was {{launched}} in 1998. Early examples of BH irreverence include [...] "The Donald Rumsfeld <b>Soundbite</b> <b>of</b> the Week" [...] and [...] "Martin Jarvis Reads Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone". (The latter being the actor Martin Jarvis reading the six words [...] "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", designed to poke fun {{at the amount of}} time Radio 4 had been devoting to Harry Potter and to readings, of anything and everything, by Martin Jarvis.) ...|$|E
50|$|Currently Martin von Haselberg {{has created}} a series of large {{photographic}} images made into inflatable sculptural shapes titled 'Floatulents', and Brian Routh is working on soundworks that incorporate vocal <b>soundbites</b> <b>of</b> world leaders, politicians, madmen, poets, murderers and others.|$|R
5000|$|After a {{few months}} the <b>soundbites</b> <b>of</b> Judge Milian's voice were dropped from the opening, and the wording of Curt Chaplin's {{introduction}} was slightly changed: Everybody's talking about the honorable Marilyn Milian, the hottest judge on television. Real cases, real litigants. Here, in our forum: The People's Court.|$|R
5000|$|Whenever Jim Nantz is mentioned, two <b>soundbites</b> <b>of</b> Nantz {{making an}} unintelligible noise and of Nantz saying his {{signature}} [...] "Hello, friends!" [...] introduction are played, often in excess, with Carton mocking him. Carton and Esiason will {{make fun of}} Nantz during The Masters golf tournament and during the NFL season.|$|R
5000|$|Whenever a news topic {{involving}} Jordany Valdespin is mentioned, a <b>soundbite</b> <b>of</b> Valdespin saying [...] "I'm the man right now" [...] is played, with Carton mocking him {{at various}} intervals, {{including the use}} of a Russian accent to imitate him (despite the fact that Valdespin is actually Dominican). During a segment, Carton, as Valdespin, pretended to ask David Wright, Dukes, Francesa, Joe Benigno, Marc Malussis and even Russian president Vladimir Putin if they were [...] "The Man" [...] (in reference to Valdespin's catchphrase), with Carton repling [...] "No, because I'm the man right now!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Davey's {{versatility}} {{and added}} bulk saw him {{used in the}} forward line, midfield and even at times defence. Initially, football commentators on 3AW, especially Rex Hunt, referred to him as [...] "Jack Davey" [...] - {{a reference to a}} former Australian radio quiz show host Jack Davey, whose trademark greeting {{at the opening of the}} show was [...] "Hi Ho, everybody!" [...] Due to this it is not uncommon to hear 3AW replay a <b>soundbite</b> <b>of</b> Jack Davey saying [...] "Hi Ho, everybody" [...] whenever Davey scores a goal. But more recently (from 2006 onwards), he has been widely referred to as [...] "Flash" [...] by many commentators for his incredible pace and acceleration.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{begins with}} a man asking a young boy to define such words as bigotry, segregation, and hatred (to which the boy says he doesn't know); he says that {{prejudice}} is [...] "when someone's sick". Following that is a <b>soundbite</b> <b>of</b> a drill sergeant leading a platoon into training, along with gunfire sound effects, after which are snippets of the two songs - both as recorded by The Blackberries, a session recording group. Interspersed are excerpts of speeches by John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, the eulogy (given by Ted Kennedy) after Robert's assassination, and Martin Luther King, Jr., and soundbites of news coverage of each one's assassination. The ending of the song is a reprise of the introduction.|$|E
50|$|Early <b>soundbites</b> <b>of</b> tracks {{from the}} album {{appeared}} in the band's periodical video diary on YouTube. While being interviewed for the BBC Culture Show, Alex Turner and Matt Helders cited Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Jake Thackray, John Cale, Nick Cave, Roky Erickson, and The Beatles were all major influences on the recording of the album.|$|R
5000|$|The {{similarities}} between the two candidates are displayed through <b>soundbites</b> <b>of</b> their speeches. Among the topics that George W. Bush and Al Gore agree on, {{as shown in the}} video: support of the death penalty, prosperity through free trade, investing in the future, support of clean air, and a ban on soft money. Each candidate concludes by stating [...] "God Bless America." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rutledge M. Dennis {{suggests}} that through <b>soundbites</b> <b>of</b> works like Jensens famous {{study on the}} achievement gap, and Herrnstein and Murrays book The Bell Curve, the media [...] "paints a picture of Blacks and other people of color as collective biological illiterates—as not only intellectually unfit but evil and criminal as well," [...] thus providing, he says [...] "the logic and justification {{for those who would}} further disenfranchise and exclude racial and ethnic minorities." ...|$|R
5000|$|The game {{included}} {{a fair amount}} of humor - the game itself loads initially as Defender of the Crown (another Cinemaware title) with a splash screen and music. The game version of the Stooges walk onto the screen, the music screeches to a halt, a Larry soundbite exclaims [...] "Hey, this looks like a kid's game!", Moe replies [...] "You idiots!", and follows up with a smacking noise and Curly yelling, [...] "OH!". The NES port, made by Activision, used a slightly edited version of the Ghostbusters title screen instead, in order to promote Ghostbusters II, and {{included a}}n extra <b>soundbite</b> <b>of</b> Curly saying [...] "Hey, fellas! We're in the wrong game!". The 2002 port by Crawfish Interactive kept the Defender of the Crown opening, only this time having Moe yell [...] "You idiots! We're in the wrong game!", then having the Stooges walk along a country road with billboards advertising Crawfish, as well as the now-defunct Cinemaware and the then-upcoming game Wings.|$|E
5000|$|On The X Factor, Levendis {{has been}} {{characterized}} as the [...] "good judge", while he has had confrontations with fellow judge Giorgos Theofanous on various issues. In November 2009, {{relations between the two}} escalated when Theofanous mocked Levendis' Greek language skills, stating that Levendis should have fellow judge Katerina Gagaki translate and write out his thoughts for him to read instead. Theofanous also criticized Levendis' tendency to vote for acts that sing predominantly international songs instead of Greek, claiming that there is currently a crisis in the Greek music industry and that he is not helping with his actions. In January 2010, Levendis' Greek language skills were put into question again when popular ANT1 talk show Radio Arvyla created a parody of Levendis using an actual <b>soundbite</b> <b>of</b> him that demonstrated his lack of fluency in Greek. The parody became a viral hit in Greece and prompted the formation of a Facebook group, while Levendis later acknowledged it was funny and was bound to catch on.|$|E
5000|$|In many ways, {{these three}} songs on Buffalo Springfield Again, [...] "Mr. Soul", [...] "Expecting to Fly", and [...] "Broken Arrow", are harbingers {{of much of}} Young's later work in that, {{although}} they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. [...] "Mr. Soul" [...] is the only Young song of the three that all {{five members of the}} group performed together. In contrast, [...] "Broken Arrow" [...] was confessional folk-rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Young's experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a <b>soundbite</b> <b>of</b> Dewey Martin singing [...] "Mr. Soul" [...] and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. [...] "Expecting to Fly" [...] was a lushly produced ballad similar to the baroque pop of the mid-1960s, featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track, Jack Nitzsche, would dub [...] "symphonic pop".|$|E
5000|$|Hotel X toured {{regionally}} {{and nationally}} between 1992 and 1997, received reviews in Jazz Times, The Washington Post, Option, The Wire and Alternative Press among others; {{was nominated for}} Best Jazz Group by the National Association of Independent Record Distributors (NAIRD) in 1996; and participated in the JVC Jazz Festival in New York City in 1997. National Public Radio selected <b>soundbites</b> <b>of</b> several songs from the Hotel X album Engendered Species for use between news stories in 1994. Richmond Magazine awarded Hotel X with the Pollack Prize for Excellence in Arts in September 2005.|$|R
50|$|Recording was a long, tedious process. She {{explained}} {{that she was having}} a hard time going back to singing after giving birth, gaining and losing significant weight followed by the diagnosis of Acid Reflux around the time she was recording. The album took 9 months to finalize all the recording of vocals and finishing touches. She also added some candid <b>soundbites</b> <b>of</b> her son and herself in some songs which gives off a natural atmosphere and showcases the bond between mother and son. Her son's presence and participation is felt all throughout. The soundbites are taken from posted videos of Velasquez in her Instagram account.|$|R
5000|$|The game's other vocal <b>soundbite,</b> that <b>of</b> {{a batter}} {{turning to the}} umpire and {{screaming}} [...] "Oh come on!" [...] after a called strike three was sampled from a Jim Belushi line in the 1985 movie The Man With One Red Shoe.|$|R
5000|$|Day 38: The Industrial housemates {{woke up to}} {{the sound}} of the classic Tagalog children's song Bahay Kubo. Ryan's cluelessness about the song prompts Big Brother to assign the weekly task to Unad, Steph, and Kim (see below). For lunch, the {{so-called}} [...] "Overseas Filipino Kids" [...] (OFK)—Seichang, Kevin, and Ryan—were taught how to cook the traditional Filipino dishes adobo, pork sinigang, paksiw na isda (fish in vinegar sauce) and pancit bihon. Former housemate and DJ-by-trade Casey was utilized as the voice of the new Big Brother Radio and she played a <b>soundbite</b> <b>of</b> Divine's comments about the Industrial House being a better place without Luz, who was left visibly affected enough to [...] "phone in" [...] her thoughts on the matter. Casey later posted another blind item directed at Mark and Kim. At the Luxury House, Joya and Roy talked about Kigoy with Big Brother, who assigns their weekly task. The housemates plan to stage a so-called [...] "Mr PBB" [...] pageant as part of the task while Joya tries to talk to him that it is for his own good. Seth's issues about being discriminated and his own rift with Divine since he came to the house became a topic of discussion. Wendy and Deniesse's profanity-laden chats were later replayed over the speakers. Tol acted as a father figure to discipline the two, both of whom reportedly resemble his own daughters. He also led a discussion in the living room on proper family values, with the housemates talking about life lessons passed down by their parents. Seth waited outside the confession room all night long to talk about what they discussed.|$|E
5000|$|An {{assessment}} {{of the performance of}} each MSP by The Herald newspaper published in the middle of December 1999 noted that Welsh was only on leave of absence from being Chief Executive of Kilmarnock F.C., and said that he was [...] "clearly finding the transition to 'humble' back bencher a bit hard". A week later, Welsh suddenly resigned his seat, explaining that the decision came after [...] "considerable heart searching and extended family debate". After press speculation that he was disappointed not to have achieved high office, Welsh wrote an article explaining that as a council leader he delivered [...] "real service to constituents, rather than the threadbare and raddled <b>soundbites</b> <b>of</b> politicians who promise everything and deliver nothing". At 230 days after election, he was the first MSP to resign from the job. The subsequent by-election was won by John Scott for the Conservatives, gaining the party their first ever constituency seat in the Scottish Parliament.|$|R
5000|$|Attention Grabber - A weekly segment where Carton selects an {{attractive}} random woman (usually from Maxim), with a <b>soundbite</b> consisting <b>of</b> Esiason saying [...] "She's a hot box of rocks" [...] {{used as a}} [...] "seal of approval". Often, Carton precedes the segment by asking Al Dukes (the show's producer, affectionately known as [...] "Al Hughes") {{what would he do}} if he saw the woman. Notable [...] "Attention Grabbers" [...] have included Caitlin Upton, Kelly Brook and Riyo Mori ...|$|R
500|$|Experts {{came up with}} a range <b>of</b> <b>soundbites</b> to {{summarize}} the mission to the public. Iwan Williams of Queen Mary, University of London, said [...] "It was like a mosquito hitting a 747. What we've found is that the mosquito didn't splat on the surface; it's actually gone through the windscreen." ...|$|R
40|$|Armchair Anarchy is a one–off coptic bound artists’ {{book that}} {{contains}} six individual parazines that collectively present a typographic poem {{in the form}} <b>of</b> <b>soundbites</b> from a disparate group of storytellers, musicians, fictional TV characters and everyday life {{in an attempt to}} uncover profound, absurd and comical questions about our existence and its history...|$|R
500|$|On {{the heels}} of 1984's presidential campaign, the rock group Supertramp {{featured}} spoken voice-overs from both Reagan and Bush on the right audio channel and their Democratic opponents Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro on the left audio channel durning the fade-out for their song [...] "Better Days". The song's video reviews the 20th century through a retrospective montage of its hardships and the leaders who promised solution. Beginning with the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} the Third Reich, the video sequences clips of military parades and battles moving forward to atomic test and other advancements in weapons technology, to footage of President Nixon, and then Reagan as his voice can be heard saying, [...] "Our nation is poised...for greatness." [...] In a similar vein, the last minute of Def Leppard's [...] "God's of War" [...] is layered with <b>soundbites</b> <b>of</b> Reagan, Thatcher and the noises of missile launches and bombs exploding. In a departure from Cold War rhetoric, the two leaders' quotes are lifted from their justifications for the 1986 United States bombing of Libya and Britain's participation in the affair. Reagan's quotes serve as precursory marks to the War of Terror that the U.S. would lead against majority Muslim countries in the following decades. He can be heard on the track saying, [...] "A message to terrorists everywhere. You can run...but you can't hide", and, [...] "We are not going to tolerate these attacks from outlaw states", ending with, [...] "They counted on America to be passive...They counted wrong," [...] in contrast to Def Leppard's anti-war lyrics.|$|R
50|$|Clandestino is {{the first}} {{full-length}} solo album by Manu Chao, released in 1998. The album contains many <b>soundbites</b> throughout, two <b>of</b> which are bits of a speech by Subcomandante Marcos. The French edition of Rolling Stone magazine named this album the 67th greatest French rock album (out of 100). The album was {{also included in the}} book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|R

5000|$|On April 1, 1996, in an April Fools' Day stunt, KROY {{returned}} to the airwaves one last time (on what was now KSEG) as many of KROY's DJs - including Dave Williams, Johnny Hyde, and Martin [...] "Wonder Rabbit" [...] Ashley - reunited for an historic twelve-hour broadcast recreating a typical KROY broadcast day. The station has also been recalled by 1240KROY Online, a website featuring <b>soundbites,</b> jingles, pictures <b>of</b> staff members and their recollections, plus the recollections of long-time listeners.|$|R
5000|$|... "Utterly {{slick and}} relentlessly {{determined}} to entertain, Helpless, a new play by Dusty Hughes at the Donmar Warehouse, lives {{solely on the}} surface. Its six characters all sound like mere Characters In Plays, nothing more. They have flamboyant entrance lines in which they draw attention to themselves and deliver more plot exposition than is sane; they go in for longer-than-long conversations of oneliners (like endless tennis rallies between players you don't care about); they do {{a great deal of}} speaking at cross-purposes. All of which makes all six of them deeply irritating, and all of which proves wholly contrived. Hughes's themes feel like so much tokenism. None of the characters is believable. Or interesting. Worst, in a play about different kinds of liberal socialists between the late 1990s and today, the unspontaneous <b>soundbite</b> artificiality <b>of</b> the way they talk just sounds like so much spin." [...] (The Financial Times).|$|R
5000|$|In addition, a {{recurrent}} gag {{on the show}} has Carton mocking various sportscasters, most frequently Jim Nantz, Jim Rome, John Sterling, Kevin Harlan, Marv Albert and Suzyn Waldman (He also mocks Albert's son Kenny, Orel Hershiser, Chris Russo and Mike Francesa) [...] Another gag on the show had Carton suggesting to use star 67 if the person he wants Al Dukes to call does not respond. Other gags have included Carton asking Esiason for an advance copy of the video game Call of Duty due to Esiason's association with an employee from Activision, as well as Carton's dislike of ice hockey, reflected in <b>soundbites</b> consisting <b>of</b> a little girl saying that [...] "I don't really care about hockey" [...] and another from B&C blog writer Bob Dwyer saying that [...] "nobody cares about hockey, Boomer", the latter being played whenever Esiason brings up a topic or news regarding ice hockey.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} some wider concerns, as the media {{continue}} to change, for example that the brevity of news reports and use <b>of</b> <b>soundbites</b> has reduced fidelity to the truth, and may contribute {{to a lack of}} needed context for public understanding. From outside the profession, the rise of news management contributes to the real possibility that news media may be deliberately manipulated. Selective reporting (spiking, double standards) are very commonly alleged against newspapers, and by their nature are forms of bias not easy to establish, or guard against.|$|R
2500|$|In 1987, a {{completed}} Uncle Meat film {{was released on}} home video, and the Uncle Meat album was subsequently reissued as a double CD which included a song recorded in 1982, [...] "Tengo Na Minchia Tanta", sung in Sicilian by Massimo Bassoli, who identifies the song as being translated as [...] "I've Got a Big Bunch Of Dick", and over 40 minutes' worth <b>of</b> <b>soundbites</b> and dialogue from the film. The track listing programs the new tracks {{at the beginning of}} the second disc, placing the material between the album's original third and fourth sides. [...] The original 1969 vinyl mix was reissued in 2016 as part of the Meat Light audio documentary box set.|$|R
5000|$|Order of the Leech is {{the tenth}} album by the British grindcore band Napalm Death, {{released}} in 2002 through Spitfire. Although credited in the line-up, Jesse Pintado never performed. The second guitar is actually Mitch Harris overdubbing, hence marking this album's lineup as today's lineup. [...] "The Great Capitulator" [...] is exactly 2:49. At {{the end of}} the song, a long silence follows from 2:50 to 9:56. At 9:57 a soundbit comes fading in of a fan speaking of his attitude to metal music, mentioning bands like Krabathor or Immortal. His speech is then translated in Czech. It is the last album in a trilogy to feature this kind <b>of</b> <b>soundbites,</b> with the others being Leaders Not Followers EP and Enemy of the Music Business.|$|R
40|$|The rise of New Labour and its {{associated}} politics of the 'third way' is undoubtedly {{one of the most}} talked about political phenomena of the past decade. Few, though, can agree on just what it is they are talking about. Some argue it represents a truly novel and distinctive centre-left approach - a form of social democracy designed to cope with the 'realities' of modern politics. Others see it as a largely rhetorical construct: a set <b>of</b> <b>soundbites</b> designed to disguise either a return to traditional social democratic eclecticism or, more commonly, a historic capitulation to neo-liberalism and globalisation. There seems little hope for a conclusive end to this debate in the near future. Certainly, anyone hoping that Labour's second term will serve to settle the question once and for all would be well advised not to hold their breath...|$|R
40|$|The average listener's {{attention}} has been declining in recent decades especially, calculating that these days a young person has much less ability to concentrate hearing their parents: {{less than two minutes}} instead of eight recorded in the 60 decade (Meditsch, 1999). This factor combined with the voracious consumption, immediate and ever faster information influences the sound on journalistic content? The audio on webradios tends to be a short <b>soundbite?</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study is to determine whether the referred soundbite culture actually exists in the audios of news sites of radio and if the audio has a complementary information regarding the text. We analyzed the Portuguese websites of TSF, Rádio Renascença, RDP and RCP at random periods for three years and we may say that they did not join the soundbite culture in journalistic content...|$|R
40|$|UK {{broadcasters}} {{came under}} fire {{for the amount of}} airtime UKIP and its leader Nigel Farage received after the party won the most votes in the 2014 EU election. Our content analysis of television news during the 2009 and 2014 campaigns found little bias in terms <b>of</b> <b>soundbites,</b> but in the more recent election Farage visually appeared in coverage to a greater degree than other party leaders. Moreover, two core UKIP policies—being in or out of Europe and immigration—dominated coverage in 2014. We suggest the ‘UKIP factor’ and the media's fascination with Nigel Farage help explain why the 2014 campaign was more visible on television news than was the case in 2009 and was largely reported through a Westminster prism. Although television news bulletins attempt to impartially report elections, the 2014 campaign agenda was largely contested on UKIP's ideological terrain and the party's electoral fortunes...|$|R
5000|$|Eric Bryant debated Stuart Semple and {{contemporary}} Pop Art in a seminal ARTnews feature 50 years after Richard Hamilton had defined the movement. [...] "While earlier generations of Pop artists exhibited a similar love-hate relationship with consumer culture and glamour, this group takes on fear and violence." [...] Semple's relationship with current culture, politics and imagery has {{put him at}} the forefront of the next generation of debate, where artists now tackle the current climate of fear; [...] "his often disturbing, even sinister works also feature guns, pills, and frequent references to suicide." [...] In being categorised within Pop Art, Aidan Duane debated in The Irish Times how his work brings it up to date.There is a real intelligence at the heart of his art. On the one hand he clearly embraces the throwaway, famous-for-15-minutes <b>soundbite</b> culture <b>of</b> celebrity and distraction. On the other, he stops it in its tracks, recasting its giddy imagery in the slow, fixed medium of paint. He might seem to celebrate it, but he actually doesn’t quite trust the world of mass production and communications. His work implies a conviction that there is, or perhaps there better be, something genuine, something real, beyond the glam facade of throwaway culture. In Vogue Italia Stuart Semple discusses his critical relationship with Pop culture in a post Warhol society where it has become a universal language but aims to act removed.|$|R
