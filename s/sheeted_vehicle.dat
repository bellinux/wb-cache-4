5000|$|However, {{depository}} {{banks had}} moved sizable amounts of {{assets and liabilities}} off-balance sheet, via complex legal entities called special purpose vehicles. This allowed the banks to remove these amounts from the capital requirements computation, allowing them to take on more risk, but make higher profits during the pre-crisis boom period. When these off-balance <b>sheet</b> <b>vehicles</b> encountered difficulties beginning in 2007, many depository banks were required to cover their losses. Martin Wolf wrote in June 2009: [...] "...an enormous part of what banks did {{in the early part}} of this decade - the off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself - was to find a way round regulation." ...|$|R
40|$|How did {{problems}} with subprime mortgages {{result in a}} systemic crisis, a panic? The ongoing Panic of 2007 {{is due to a}} loss of information about the location and size of risks of loss due to default on a number of interlinked securities, special purpose vehicles, and derivatives, all related to subprime mortgages. Subprime mortgages are a financial innovation designed to provide home ownership opportunities to riskier borrowers. Addressing their risk required a particular design feature, linked to house price appreciation. Subprime mortgages were then financed via securitization, which in turn has a unique design reflecting the subprime mortgage design. Subprime securitization tranches were often sold to CDOs, which were, in turn, often purchased by market value off-balance <b>sheet</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Additional subprime risk was created (though not on net) with derivatives. When the housing price bubble burst, this chain of securities, derivatives, and off-balance <b>sheet</b> <b>vehicles</b> could not be penetrated by most investors to determine the location and size of the risks. The introduction of the ABX indices, synthetics related to portfolios of subprime bonds, in 2006 created common knowledge about the effects of these risks by providing centralized prices and a mechanism for shorting. I describe the relevant securities, derivatives, and vehicles and provide some very simple, stylized, examples to show: (1) how asymmetric information between the sell-side and the buy-side was created via complexity; (2) how the chain of interlinked securities was sensitive to house prices; (3) how the risk was spread in an opaque way; and (4) how the ABX indices allowed information to be aggregated and revealed. I argue that these details {{are at the heart of}} the answer to the question of the origin of the Panic of 2007. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{catalyst}} of {{the current}} financial turmoil has been the losses on the subprime mortgage market. However, the low quality of these partly collateralised housing loans was known {{for a while and}} the default on subprime mortgages largely expected. Therefore, how to account for the fact that an expected shock on a small segment of the US mortgage market turned into a major financial crisis, causing the near-collapse of the Commercial Paper and of the interbank lending markets, that is to say of two of the most liquid financial markets? Banks have transferred risks to special entities, the so-called “conduits”, SIV (Special Investment Vehicles) and SPV (Special Purpose Vehicles). Such a practice gave the false impression that credit risk was transferred from banks outside the financial system. This was indeed not the case. The funding needs associated in particular with backup lines of credit for off-balance <b>sheet</b> <b>vehicles</b> generated pressures on the the interbank markets and led central banks to massively intervene. The roots {{of the current}} turmoil are therefore of a deeper and structural nature. For that reason, it is necessary to assess, from a longer term perspective, what are the main consequences of the recent structural changes on financial markets {{in order to have a}} good grasp on the current financial market dynamics and clarify what is meant nowadays by liquidity. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in banking and corporate finance. The first essay examines how changes {{in the composition of}} the human capital of the workforce impact the CEO. Over the last fifty years, technological change has caused the tasks workers perform to shift from routine to nonroutine work. As a result, the role of the CEO has evolved to become more focused on developing the human capital within the firm. I estimate that these changes {{in the role of the}} CEO caused CEO pay to double over the last thirty years, explaining roughly one-third of the aggregate increase in CEO pay. The second essay, co-authored with Carlos Arteta, Mark Carey, and Ricardo Correa, empirically examines financial institutions' motivations to take systematic bad-tail risk in the form of sponsorship of credit-arbitrage asset-backed commercial paper vehicles. A run on debt issued by such vehicles played a key role in the crisis that began in the summer of 2007. We find evidence consistent with important roles for both owner-manager agency problems and government-induced distortions, especially government control or ownership of banks. The final essay explores the impact of capital regulation on bank risk taking. I utilize a triple difference specification to identify the effect of FIN 46 [...] which increased regulatory capital requirements for U. S. banks sponsoring off-balance <b>sheet</b> <b>vehicles</b> [...] on systematic risk exposure. I find that after the regulation, banks' exposure to vehicles with high systematic risk increases relative to vehicles with low risk and relative to non-U. S. banks which are not affected by the regulation. These results suggest that capital regulation has the perverse effect of concentrating systematic risk, potentially increasing the systemic risk of the financial system...|$|R

This study used a full-scale CNC machined physical representation of a <b>sheet</b> metal <b>vehicle</b> body to evaluate the measurement agreement and repeatability of critical surface points using a multi-sensor horizontal dual arm CMM. It was found that there were errors between CMM arms and with regard to part coordinate frame construction when using the different probing systems.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the best {{practices of the}} Vehicle Design Team for VIPA. The functions of the VIPA Vehicle Design (VVD) discipline team are to maintain the controlled reference geometry and provide linked, simplified geometry {{for each of the}} other discipline analyses. The core of the VVD work, and the approach for VVD s first task of controlling the reference geometry, involves systems engineering, top-down, layout-based CAD modeling within a Product Data Manager (PDM) development environment. The top- down approach allows for simple control of very large, integrated assemblies and greatly enhances the ability to generate trade configurations and reuse data. The second VVD task, model simplification for analysis, is handled within the managed environment through application of the master model concept. In this approach, there is a single controlling, or master, product definition dataset. Connected to this master model are reference datasets with live geometric and expression links. The referenced models can be for drawings, manufacturing, visualization, embedded analysis, or analysis simplification. A discussion of web based interaction, including visualization, between the design and other disciplines is included. Demonstrated examples are cited, including the Space Launch Initiative development cycle, the Saturn V systems integration and verification cycle, an Orbital Space Plane study, and NASA Exploration Office studies of Shuttle derived and clean <b>sheet</b> launch <b>vehicles.</b> The VIPA Team has brought an immense amount of detailed data to bear on program issues.

40|$|Magnesium, with a Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) structure, is {{the eighth}} most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} earth’s crust and the third most plentiful element dissolved in the seawater. Magnesium alloys exhibit the attractive characteristics of low densities and high strength-to-weight ratios along with good castability, recyclability, and machinability. Replacing the steel and/or aluminum sheet parts with magnesium <b>sheet</b> parts in <b>vehicles</b> {{is a great way}} of reducing the vehicles weight, which results in great savings on fuel consumption. The lack of magnesium <b>sheet</b> components in <b>vehicle</b> assemblies is due to magnesium’s poor room-temperature formability. In order to successfully form the sheets of magnesium at room temperature, it is necessary to understand the formability of magnesium at room temperature controlled by various plastic deformation mechanisms. The plastic deformation mechanisms in pure magnesium and some of its alloys at room temperature are crystallographic slip and deformation twinning. The slip systems in magnesium at room temperature are classified into primary (first generation), secondary (second generation), and tertiary (third generation) slip systems. The twinning systems in magnesium at room temperature are classified into primary (first generation) and secondary (second generation, or double) twinning systems. A new comprehensive rate-dependent elastic-viscoplastic Crystal Plasticity Constitutive Model (CPCM) that accounts for all these plastic deformation mechanisms in magnesium was proposed. The proposed model individually simulates slip-induced shear in the parent {{as well as in the}} primary and secondary twinned regions, and twinning-induced shear in the primary and secondary twinned regions. The model also tracks the texture evolution in the parent, primary and secondary twinned regions. Separate resistance evolution functions for the primary, secondary, and tertiary slip systems, as well as primary and secondary twinning systems were considered in the formulation. In the resistance evolution functions, the interactions between various slip and twinning systems were accounted for. The CPCM was calibrated using the experimental data reported in the literature for pure magnesium single crystals at room temperature, but needs further experimental data for full calibration. The partially calibrated model was used to assess the contributions of various plastic deformation mechanisms in the material stress-strain response. The results showed that neglecting secondary slip and secondary twinning while simulating plastic deformation of magnesium alloys by crystal plasticity approach can lead to erroneous results. This indicates that all the plastic deformation mechanisms have to be accounted for when modelling the plastic deformation in magnesium alloys. Also, the CPCM in conjunction with the Marciniak–Kuczynski (M–K) framework were used to assess the formability of a magnesium single crystal sheet at room temperature by predicting the Forming Limit Diagrams (FLDs). Sheet necking was initiated from an initial imperfection in terms of a narrow band. A homogeneous deformation field was assumed inside and outside the band, and conditions of compatibility and equilibrium were enforced across the band interfaces. Thus, the CPCM only needs to be applied to two regions, one inside and one outside the band. The FLDs were simulated under two conditions: a) the plastic deformation mechanisms are primary slip systems alone, and b) the plastic deformation mechanisms are primary slip and primary twinning systems. The FLDs were computed for two grain orientations. In the first orientation, primary extension twinning systems had favourable orientation for activation. In the second orientation, primary contraction twinning systems had favourable orientation for activation. The effects of shear strain outside the necking band, rate sensitivity, and c/a ratio on the simulated FLDs in the two grain orientations were individually explored...|$|R
40|$|Weight {{reduction}} is one possibility {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and emission of transportation <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Sheet</b> metals {{are often used}} in automotive and aerospace applications and therefore the weight reduction achieved by reducing the sheet metals thickness is an important contribution to weight reduction. Increasing the strength of sheet metal materials gives the opportunity to reduce the total weight while maintaining safety. To prove a maintained safety for parts with a decreased weight Finite Element (FE) simulations are commonly used. This leads to a high demand on the simulation precision of sheet metals, where an accurate prediction of the post-necking behaviour of materials is needed. Improved FE simulations are reducing time and costs during the development processes.   One application to improve the strength of sheet metals in the automotive industry is the usage of ultra high strength steels, which has constantly increased in usage during the last decades. The development of the press hardening process, where sheet metal blanks are formed and quenched simultaneously, brings new design opportunities. Using press hardening tools with zones that uses different cooling rates sheet metal parts can be produced with tailored properties, to improve their performance. Simulating materials based on the microstructure demands high precision on the plasticity modelling for high strain values.   In this thesis work a method to characterize the elasto plastic post necking behaviour of sheet metal materials, the Stepwise Modelling Method (SMM), is presented. The method uses full field measurements of the deformation field on the surface of tensile specimen. The hardening relation is modelled as a piecewise linear in a step by step procedure. The linear hardening parameter is adapted to reduce the residual between experimental and calculated tensile forces. The SMM is used to characterize the post necking behaviour of a ferritic boron steel and the results are compared with the commonly used inverse modelling method. It is shown that the stepwise modelling method characterizes the true stress, true plastic strain relation in an effective and computational efficient way. Furthermore, the SMM is used to characterize the stress state evolution during tensile testing, which is an important factor for failure and fracture modelling. This method is shown in an aerospace application for the nickel based super alloy Alloy 718.   The results shows that the stepwise modelling method is an effective and efficient alternative method to characterize the deformation and failure of sheet metals. Based on the results of this method plasticity and fracture models can be characterized in future work...|$|R
