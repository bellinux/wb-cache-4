50|$|The ripper is {{the long}} claw-like device {{on the back}} of the bulldozer. Rippers can come as a single (single shank/giant ripper) or in groups of two or more (multi shank rippers). Usually, a single shank is {{preferred}} for heavy ripping. The ripper shank is fitted with a replaceable tungsten steel alloy tip, referred to as a 'boot'.Ripping rock breaks the ground surface rock or pavement into <b>small</b> <b>rubble</b> easy to handle and transport, which can then be removed so grading can take place. With agricultural ripping, a farmer breaks up rocky or very hard earth (such as podzol hardpan), which is otherwise unploughable, in order to farm it. For example, much of the best land in the California wine country consists of old lava flows. The grower shatters the lava with heavy bulldozers so surface crops or trees can be planted.Some bulldozers are equipped with a less common rear attachment referred to as a stumpbuster, which is a single spike that protrudes horizontally and can be raised to get it (mostly) out of the way. A stumpbuster is used to split a tree stump. A bulldozer with a stumpbuster is used for landclearing operations, and is often equipped with a brush-rake blade.|$|E
50|$|The site of Upper Zohar {{occupies}} roughly 26 meters squared, {{a square}} fortlet with protruding towers at each corner. It {{is not a}} perfect square, but rather than carelessness, this {{is caused by the}} desire {{to make use of the}} characteristics of the site itself. The fortlet was constructed using dense chert quarried nearby, though limestone was used for doorways and some exterior corners of the towers. The curtain walls varied between 1 and 1.5 meters in width, and were built with coursed faces both on the inside and outside. Laid in a shallow foundation, they were set using wet earth and filled with <b>small</b> <b>rubble.</b> Each corner tower was approximately 4 * 4.5 meters, and contained both a lower and upper level. Their walls were preserved up to a height of 3 meters. Access to the top of the walls was provided by a pair of staircases on the northern and southern walls. In the middle of the courtyard, which is roughly 17 meters squared, stood a cistern sunk into the bedrock. The cistern was circular, 3.75 meters in diameter and 5 meters deep. On the eastern side of the courtyard stood three rooms, although the northern and southern rooms were demolished at some point, leaving a sole room that may have served as a chapel. The fortlet's gateway, roughly 2 meters wide, stood in the middle of the western wall. At some point a wall was built from the tower at the north-western corner of the fort, past the gateway and parallel to the wall. This perhaps served as shelter for animals.|$|E

40|$|The {{implication}} of {{small amounts of}} cohesion within relatively <b>small</b> <b>rubble</b> pile asteroids is investigated {{with regard to their}} evolution under the persistent presence of the YORP effect. We find that below a characteristic size, which is a function of cohesive strength, density and other properties, rubble pile asteroids can enter a "disaggregation phase" in which they are subject to repeated fissions after which the formation of a stabilizing binary system is not possible. Once this threshold is passed rubble pile asteroids may be disaggregated into their constituent components within a finite time span. These constituent components will have their own spin limits [...] albeit potentially at a much higher spin rate due to the greater strength of a monolithic body. The implications of this prediction are discussed and include modification of size distributions, prevalence of monolithic bodies among meteoroids and the lifetime of <b>small</b> <b>rubble</b> pile bodies in the solar system. The theory is then used to place constraints on the strength of binary asteroids characterized as a function of their type. Comment: Accepted for publication in Icaru...|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{hypothesis}} that, due to small van der Waals forces between constituent grains, <b>small</b> <b>rubble</b> pile asteroids {{have a small}} but non-zero cohesive strength. The nature of this model predicts that the cohesive strength should be constant independent of aster-oid size, which creates a scale dependence with relative strength in-creasing as size decreases. This model counters classical theory that rubble pile asteroids should behave as scale-independent cohesionless collections of rocks. We explore a simple model for asteroid strength {{that is based on}} these weak forces, validate it through granular me-chanics simulations and comparisons with properties of lunar regolith, and then explore its implications and ability to explain and predict observed properties of small asteroids in the NEA and Main Belt pop-ulations, and in particular of asteroid 2008 TC 3. One conclusion is that the population of rapidly rotating asteroids could consist of both distributions of smaller grains (i. e., rubble piles) and of monolithic boulders. ...|$|E
40|$|Space {{missions}} and ground-based observations {{have shown that}} some asteroids are loose collections of rubble rather than solid bodies. The physical behaviour of such ‘rubble-pile’ asteroids has been traditionally described using only gravitational and frictional forces within a granular material. Cohesive forces {{in the form of}} small van der Waals forces between constituent grains have recently been predicted to be important for <b>small</b> <b>rubble</b> piles (ten kilometres across or less), and could potentially explain fast rotation rates in the small-asteroid population. The strongest evidence so far has come from an analysis of the rotational breakup of the main-belt comet P/ 2013 R 3, although that was indirect and poorly constrained by observations. Here we report that the kilometre-sized asteroid (29075) 1950 DA is a rubble pile that is rotating faster than is allowed by gravity and friction. We find that cohesive forces are required to prevent surface mass shedding and structural failure, and that the strengths of the forces are comparable to, though somewhat less than, the forces found between the grains of lunar regolith...|$|E
40|$|Coral reefs provide {{economic}} and environmental services {{to millions of people}} as areas for recreation, sources of food, jobs, and shoreline protection; and are now under threat from multiple stresses (NOAA 2002). Anthropogenic impact from acute physical events such as commercial vessel grounding and anchor drags have been well documented throughout the world and southeast Florida. However little data exist on the chronic effects of large commercial vessels anchoring on reef resources. The Port Miami commercial anchorage was designated circa 1927 and was delineated over approximately 700 acres of reef resources. Anchorage use, benthic resources, and substrate composition were surveyed to understand the impact commercial vessel anchoring activities have had. Survey sites included both random sites within the anchorage to understand the cumulative chronic effect of anchoring activity, as well as targeted surveys at recently anchored sites to understand the immediate impacts of those anchoring events. Survey data were also compared to anchorage use data to understand how vessel traffic patterns influenced impact. Results indicated that there was both significant differences at acute recent impact sites and chronic impact sites. Generally, Outer Reef chronic impact sites had more evidence of chronic impacts both in the benthic community and substrate composition than Inner Reef sites. Significant differences on Outer Reef included an increase in the percent cover of <b>small</b> <b>rubble,</b> a decrease in octocoral percent cover, and a decrease in the density of larger octocoral size classes. Significant differences on Inner Reef included a {{decrease in the number of}} scleractinian species present compared to control sites...|$|E

40|$|Most asteroids in {{the size}} range of {{approximately}} 100 m to 100 km are rubble piles, aggregates of rocky material held together mainly by gravitational forces, and only weak cohesion. They contain high macroporosities, indicating {{a large amount of}} void space in their interiors. How these voids are distributed is not yet known, as in-situ measurements are still outstanding. In this work, a model to create rubble pile asteroid simulants for use in SPH impact simulations is presented. Rubble pile asteroids are modelled as gravitational re-aggregating remnant fragments of a catastrophically disrupted parent body, which are represented by spherical pebbles. It is shown that this approach allows to explicitly follow the internal restructuring of rubble pile asteroids during impact events, while preserving the expected properties of the bulk asteroid as known from observations and experiments. The bulk behaviour of asteroid simulants, as characterized by the stability against disruption and fragment size distribution, follows the expected behaviour and is not sensitive to the exact distribution of voids in the interior structure, but rather to the void fraction as the amount of consolidated void space in between the constituent fragment pebbles. No exact a priory knowledge of the fragment size distribution inside the body is therefore needed to use this model in impact simulations. Modelling the behaviour of the large-scale rubble pile constituents during impact events is used as a tool to infer the internal structure of asteroids by linking surface features like hills or pits to the creation of sub-catastrophic craters. In this work, the <b>small</b> <b>rubble</b> pile asteroid (2867) Šteins is analysed. The flyby of the Rosetta spacecraft at Šteins has revealed several interesting features: the large crater Diamond close to the southern pole, a hill like feature almost opposite to the crater, and a catena of crater pits extending radially from the rim of the crater. A possible link between these two structures and the cratering event is investigated in a series of impact simulations varying the interior of a plausible shape of Šteins prior to the event that formed crater Diamond. A connection between the cratering event and the hill is shown to be highly unlikely. Therefore, the hill is most likely a remnant of the formation of Šteins. Its size therefore helps to infer the initial size distribution of fragments forming the asteroid. The formation of a fracture radially from the crater can be observed for rubble pile simulants with highly collimated voids. This fracture could plausibly form the catena of pits observed on Šteins. This can therefore serve as a link between observable surface features and Šteins internal structure. The interior of Šteins is most likely an aggregate of fragments that themselves are only lightly fractured, and large void spaces might be found inside the asteroid. As Šteins seems to be a good example of a YORPoid, an asteroid that has been evolved to a top-like shape by radiative forces due to the YORP effect, this gives first insights in the distribution of voids in the interior of this class of rubble pile asteroids...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{stocks of}} the topshell Trochus niloticus L. (hereafter {{referred}} to as Trochus and trochus) have decreased significantly {{as a result of}} commercial fishing. This has led to the release of hatchery-reared juveniles being viewed as a potential tool to enhance populations. However, most experimental releases have resulted in low survival rates, with little known of the reasons for these results and how to improve them. The objectives of this study were to understand better the ecology of juvenile Trochus on the reef and to use this information to identify factors affecting their survival and growth. Density, natural distribution, habitat characteristics and growth of juvenile Trochus and other gastropods on the intertidal reef flat at Orpheus Is., Australia, were sampled over a two-year period. Trochus between 1. 5 mm and 62 mm shell width (SW) were found across the reef flat, but were most abundant in the middle section of the reef, 50 - 150 m off shore. There was no evidence of a size gradient. Mean density of Trochus was 0. 178 m⁻² in 1993 and 0. 115 m⁻² in 1994. Trochus occurred in groups of 2 - 4 per m² more frequently than expected by random, but higher densities were very rarely observed. As Trochus size increased, there was a change from tending to occupy <b>small</b> <b>rubble</b> to occupying rock and coral bench, and from shallow to deeper pools. Growth rates estimated by progression of modal size classes ranged between 2. 3 and 2. 6 mm. month⁻¹. The interaction between juvenile Trochus and three common invertebrate predators, the portunid crabs, Thalamita admete and T. stimpsoni, and the carnivorous gastropod, Thais tuberose, were examined. Interactions with crabs were studied in the laboratory. The size of trochus eaten increased with crab size, but larger crabs continued to eat the smallest trochus offered. Crabs also attacked relatively large trochus, up to 24 mm SW with low probability of success. The combined action of Th. admete and Th. stimpsoni may {{have a significant effect on}} the survival of Trochus < 20 mm SW, but mainly on smaller individuals (< 13 mm SW). Crabs responded to an increase in trochus density from 5 to 30 individuals. container⁻¹ by increasing their predation rate so that the proportion of trochus eaten after 24 h was significantly greater at higher density. When offered three patches with trochus at different densities (5, 15 and 30 trochus. patch⁻¹) in large raceways, crabs did not identify the patches of high density, but instead moved frequently around all patches. After 48 h, the proportion eaten was not significantly different among the three densities. These observations of crab behaviour suggest there was no response to increased prey densities due to the crabs' mobile foraging behaviour. Field distributions of Trochus, Turbo brunneus (another herbivorous gastropod) and Thais (a predatory gastropod) were compared, and the frequency of recently dead undamaged shells was used as an indication of mortality by non-crushing predators (e. g. Thais). Distributions of Trochus, Turbo and Thais overlapped and all were often found in close proximity. The proportions of undamaged shells that were recently killed was 10...|$|E
40|$|Systematical archaeological {{excavations}} at {{the site}} Gamzigrad - Felix Romuliana continued in 2007 - 2008 in the south-eastern part of the fortified imperial palace, in {{the section of the}} thermae according to the plan of archaeological research for this site (2005 - 2009). In 2007, squares L'XXIV, M'XXIV, M'XXIH and M'XXII, which were investigated in 2005 to the horizon c, dated {{to the end of the}} 5 th and the beginning of the 6 th centuries, were completely excavated to the level of the porch of the earlier fortification of Romuliana (Plan 1). The stratigraphy of the cultural layers in these squares is as follows (Fig. 1) : Below horizon c there is a layer of construction rubble mixed with brownish-yellow, clay like, sandy soil, 50 - 75 cm thick, comprising the finds dated in the last quarter of the 4 th- 5 th centuries, layer D; The level of layer D is horizon d, where a structure destroyed in a conflagration, house 1 / 07, was discovered in squares M'XXII and M'XXIII. It could be dated, on the basis of the preserved household (pottery, metal and antler items, coins, etc.), from the last quarter of the 4 th to the middle of the 5 th century; Horizon d 1 is a mortar floor discovered beneath horizon d, which presents the earlier phase of house 1 / 07; Horizon d 2 is the earliest mortar floor inside the house 1 / 07, covered with a later mortar floor (horizon d 1) and a levelling layer of yellow sand and gravel, which comprises the finds dating also to the last quarter of the 4 th to the middle of the 5 th centuries; Layer E, 15 - 40 cm thick, is below horizon d, comprising dark brown soil with rubble and lenses of soot at the bottom, together with finds dated to the second half of the 4 th century; Horizon e is covered with layer E, and spread across all the squares which were investigated to the south and to the east of Galerius' bath, where 8 large postholes, which outlined a space 7 x 3 m large and probably some kind of porch, were found along with two furnaces and two pits; Layer F, about 30 cm thick, is the substructure of horizon e and it comprises crushed stone and pebbles mixed with lime mortar, and in places has a levelling of reddish-brown sand. Finds here were dated to the end of the 3 rd and the first half of the 4 th centuries; Horizon f is a mortar floor of the later fortification of Felix Romuliana at a level of 184. 75 m in the west and 184. 55 m in the east (an average level of 184. 64 m), which was interrupted by a trench running in an east-west direction along the southern section of squares L'-M'XXIV. The trench was filled with soot, <b>small</b> <b>rubble</b> and reddish-brown sand and comprised a large amount of artifacts, such as pottery and glass fragments, metal and bone items and coins dated to the second half of the 3 rd century (Fig. 4). Layer G consists of dark brown and yellowish-brown clay with <b>small</b> <b>rubble</b> and soot. It was a levelling layer above the intense construction rubble from the previous horizon and a substructure of horizon f. This layer comprised archaeological finds dated to the end of the 3 rd and the first half of the 4 th centuries and to the prehistoric period (Early Iron Age); Horizon g is a mortar floor of the porch of the southern and eastern rampart of the earlier fortification of Romuliana. 4 pillars of the eastern porch (pillars 1 - 4, discovered in 2004 - 2005), a corner pillar in an L-shape (pillar 5) and one pillar of the southern porch (pillar 6) have been ascertained. From this level the water and sewage canals were dug (Fig. 5). In squares K'XXII-XXIII a trench, measuring 4 x 2 m, in an east-west direction, was opened which aimed to investigate the layers beneath the Roman horizon g. The stratigraphy in this trench is as follows: - Layer G at a level of about 184. 53 m; - Layer H, about 35 cm thick, is greenish-yellow clay in which Roman canals were buried, comprising the fragments of the Early and Late Iron Age pottery and fragments of reddish rammed earth (Fig. 2); Layer I, about 20 cm thick, is greenish-brown clay, comprising the scarce fragments of the Early and Late Iron Age pottery; Virgin soil consists of yellow clay starting from a level of 184. 00 m in the west and of 183. 60 m in the east. In 2008, the remains of an earlier building were discovered beneath the floor of the apodyterium of Galerius' bath found in 2002 and below the foundation of the sudatorium and the tepidarium of the same structure, which were found in 2005. Also, for the purposes of conservation and restoration of the thermae, an apsidal room next to the west wall of the apodyterium, so called 'Galerius' dressing room', was completely filled with construction rubble, among which was found a part of an abraded vault (Fig. 6). Excavations proved that the apsidal room had been a pool with cold water, a frigidarium, which was twice renovated and was decorated with mosaic made of black, white and grey stone cubes (Fig. 7). The phases of reconstruction of the frigidarium could also be noticed in its eastern wall (Fig. 8). Also in the rubble inside the pool, glass mosaic cubes of deep blue and golden colours were discovered, indicating the decoration of the vault. In the latest phase, two pillars were constructed to carry the stairs made of stone slabs (Fig. 8). The earliest phase of this room, which had a rectangular layout and a mortar floor, could be part of the building dating back to before Galerius' bath (Plan 2). During the cleaning of the eastern wall of the frigidarium, a semicircular niche with a fresco decoration of geometrical and figural motives, painted in black, dark red, orange and blue on an ochre surface, was discovered (Fig. 3). Under Galerius' bath, a large earlier building was investigated (trenches 1 - 5 / 08). Only its foundation zone is preserved. The walls of the Imperial bath were founded on the earlier walls, which were 0. 65 m thick and had foundations which were 0. 90 m thick (Plan 2). The pilaster of the west faeade of the thermae was also founded on the earlier wall, but it destroyed a water canal (canal A discovered inside the south room of Galerius' bath in 2004), which was constructed after the earlier structure and before the Imperial bath (Fig. 9). It is interesting that the part of the earlier building to the west of the thermae was not demolished during the construction of the Imperial residence. It was adapted and incorporated into the plan of the fortified palace. The original construction was a large public building, probably theprincipia, with a row of rooms around a large courtyard, the atrium. The entrance, which had a porch and a pylon with two square towers and thresholds made of stone slabs, was in the north. (Figs. 10 - 14) Previously, this building was mistakenly dated to the 4 th- 5 th centuries, because it had been reused in Late Roman and Early Byzantine periods. (Figs. 15 - 18) However, based on the results of the new research, it could be dated to the 3 rd century. ...|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that many km-sized {{bodies in the}} Solar System are piles of rubble bound together by gravity. We present results from a project to map the parameter space of collisions between km-sized spherical rubble piles. The results will assist in parameterization of collision outcomes for Solar System formation models and give insight into fragmentation scaling laws. We use a direct numerical method to evolve the positions and velocities of the rubble pile particles under the constraints of gravity and physical collisions. We test the dependence of the collision outcomes on impact parameter and speed, impactor spin, mass ratio, and coefficient of restitution. Speeds are kept low (< 10 m/s, appropriate for dynamically cool systems such as the primordial disk during early planet formation) so that the maximum strain on the component material does not exceed the crushing strength. We compare our results with analytic estimates and hydrocode simulations. Off-axis collisions can result in fast-spinning elongated remnants or contact binaries while fast collisions result in smaller fragments overall. Clumping of debris escaping from the remnant can occur, leading {{to the formation of}} <b>smaller</b> <b>rubble</b> piles. In the cases we tested, less than 2 % of the system mass ends up orbiting the remnant. Initial spin can reduce or enhance collision outcomes, depending on the relative orientation of the spin and orbital angular momenta. We derive a relationship between impact speed and angle for critical dispersal of mass in the system. We find that our rubble piles are relatively easy to disperse, even at low impact speed, suggesting that greater dissipation is required if rubble piles are the true progenitors of protoplanets.

U slojevima je pronađeno pokretnih nalaza iz prapovijesti, antike, srednjega te novog vijeka. The {{excavations}} {{conducted in}} 2005 are a follow-up of systematic archaeological excavations {{that began in}} 2001. It was determined that the supporting piers in the northern wall cannot be fully defined {{at this stage of}} excavations. Large parts of the unearthed piers broke off and were found beneath the pier base slightly moved. The wall discovered along with the baroque cellar in 2001 in the north-eastern corner of the Palace is oriented toward the west, slightly declining to the north, up to the furthest western pier on the northern wall. In the investigated area, a modern sewage system was unearthed, cut through the baroque wall. Next to the eastern pier in the northern wing a pit was discovered containing the remains of two rococo tiled stoves. The remains show that they were decorated with reliefs of festoons and medallions. The stratigraphy of the excavations from 2002 and 2003 was confirmed in the central hall of the northern wing. After recent layers, a layer of rubble was found, which resulted from the demolition of the fortification {{at the end of the}} seventeenth century. Below it there was a burned layer with <b>smaller</b> <b>rubble</b> that emerged after conquest by the Ottomans and destruction of the Palace in the seventeenth century. The layer was rich with iron artefacts (locks, nails, projectiles). With a metal detector, several lead and iron projectiles were found along with two coins (one of them from the sixteenth century) and a partly preserved coin sample. Among the moveable goods ceramic fragments were found from all periods: a balsamarium, a lucerne, medieval spears, bone fragments painted gold, bolts (veretons), Gothic and modern historical stove-tiles, coins (from the fourteenth century), pipes, stone, iron and lead projectiles...|$|R
