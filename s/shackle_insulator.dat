50|$|<b>Shackle</b> <b>insulator</b> - In early days, the shackle {{insulators}} {{were used}} as strain insulators. But nowaday, they are frequently used for low voltage distribution lines. Such insulators can be used either in a horizontal position or in a vertical position. They can be directly fixed to the pole with a bolt or to the cross arm.|$|E
50|$|Strain {{insulator}} - A {{dead end}} or anchor pole or tower is used where a straight section of line ends, or angles off in another direction. These poles must withstand the lateral (horizontal) {{tension of the}} long straight section of wire. In order to support this lateral load, strain insulators are used. For low voltage lines (less than 11 kV), <b>shackle</b> <b>insulators</b> are used as strain insulators. However, for high voltage transmission lines, strings of cap-and-pin (suspension) insulators are used, attached to the crossarm in a horizontal direction. When the tension load in lines is exceedingly high, such as at long river spans, two or more strings are used in parallel.|$|R
