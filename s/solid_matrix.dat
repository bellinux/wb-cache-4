The model {{is based on}} a one-photon photodestruction process with the creation of an absorbing bleached molecule. We give the number of photons that different trapped dye molecules can absorb on average before they are bleached. Dyes such as Perylene Red, Perylene Orange, Pyrromethenes 567 and 597, Rhodamines 6 G and B, DCM, a Xanthylium salt, and Neon Red were investigated; significant differences were observed.

25|$|Figure 1 {{shows the}} typical line shape for {{electronic}} transitions of individual chromophores in a <b>solid</b> <b>matrix.</b> The zero-phonon line {{is located at}} a frequency ω’ determined by the intrinsic difference in energy levels between ground and excited state {{as well as by}} the local environment. The phonon sideband is shifted to a higher frequency in absorption and to a lower frequency in fluorescence. The frequency gap Δ between the zero-phonon line and the peak of the phonon side band is determined by Franck–Condon principles.|$|E
25|$|The zero-phonon line is {{an optical}} analogy to the Mössbauer lines, which {{originate}} in the recoil-free emission or absorption of gamma rays from the nuclei of atoms bound in a <b>solid</b> <b>matrix.</b> In {{the case of the}} optical zero-phonon line, the position of the chromophore is the physical parameter that may be perturbed, whereas in the gamma transition, the momenta of the atoms may be changed. More technically, the key to the analogy is the symmetry between position and momentum in the Hamiltonian of the quantum harmonic oscillator. Both position and momentum contribute in the same way (quadratically) to the total energy.|$|E
40|$|Microwave-enhanced solvent {{extraction}} {{is a relatively}} new approach for the extraction of organic pollutants from <b>solid</b> environmental <b>matrices.</b> This approach uses microwave technology to heat organic solvent in contact with the sample in either a sealed (pressurized) or open (atmospheric) vessel. The major advantage of this approach over conventional extraction procedures, such as Soxhlet extraction, is the speed of the process. As well as the principles of microwave heating, the article also describes the instrumentation required to effect the extraction process. Finally, selected applications of microwave-enhanced {{solvent extraction}} are described. Applications are divided into extraction from <b>solid</b> <b>matrices</b> and extraction from aqueous matrices. The specific analytes covered include the extraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides and phenols from solid matrices; direct extraction of chlorinated benzenes from aqueous matrices; microwave elution of a range of analytes from solid-phase extraction (SPE) media and, finally, volatile compounds, e. g. benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) from aqueous samples.

25|$|Gas {{chromatography}} {{is based}} on a partition equilibrium of analyte between a solid or viscous liquid stationary phase (often a liquid silicone-based material) and a mobile gas (most often helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter (commonly 0.53 – 0.18mm inside diameter) glass or fused-silica tube (a capillary column) or a <b>solid</b> <b>matrix</b> inside a larger metal tube (a packed column). It is widely used in analytical chemistry; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat denatures them), frequently encountered in biochemistry, it is well suited for use in the petrochemical, environmental monitoring and remediation, and industrial chemical fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.|$|E
25|$|Very few {{compounds}} of main group {{elements are}} paramagnetic. Notable examples include: oxygen, O2; nitric oxide, NO; nitrogen dioxide, NO2 and chlorine dioxide, ClO2. In organic chemistry, compounds with an unpaired electron {{are said to}} be free radicals. Free radicals, with some exceptions, are short-lived because one free radical will react rapidly with another, so their magnetic properties are difficult to study. However, if the radicals are well separated from each other in a dilute solution in a <b>solid</b> <b>matrix,</b> at low temperature, they can be studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Such radicals are generated by irradiation. Extensive EPR studies have revealed much about electron delocalization in free radicals. The simulated spectrum of the CH3• radical shows hyperfine splitting due to the interaction of the electron with the 3 equivalent hydrogen nuclei, each of which has a spin of 1/2.|$|E
25|$|All transcriptomic methods require RNA {{to first}} be {{isolated}} from the experimental organism before transcripts can be recorded. Although biological systems are incredibly diverse, RNA extraction techniques are broadly similar and involve: mechanical disruption of cells or tissues, disruption of RNase with chaotropic salts, disruption of macromolecules and nucleotide complexes, separation of RNA from undesired biomolecules including DNA, and concentration of the RNA via precipitation from solution or elution from a <b>solid</b> <b>matrix.</b> Isolated RNA may additionally be treated with DNase to digest any traces of DNA. It is necessary to enrich messenger RNA as total RNA extracts are typically 98% ribosomal RNA. Enrichment for transcripts can be performed by poly-A affinity methods or by depletion of ribosomal RNA using sequence-specific probes. Degraded RNA may affect downstream results, for example, mRNA enrichment from degraded samples {{will result in the}} depletion of 5’ mRNA ends and uneven signal across the length of a transcript. Snap-freezing of tissue prior to RNA isolation is typical, and care is taken to reduce exposure to RNase enzymes once isolation is complete.|$|E

The QuEChERS method was also used for determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in real samples and for comparison of measured results, time and material costs of the method with currently employed methods: (1) accelerated solvent extraction connected with gel permeation chromatography (ASE/GPC), and (2) ultrasonic extraction connected with solid phase extraction (UZ/SPE). According to the validation criteria, the QuEChERS method is suitable for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in <b>solid</b> <b>matrices</b> of hydrosphere. The QuEChERS technique provides comparable results to ASE/GPC and UZ/SPE.

25|$|How {{the sample}} and matrix is {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of the sample probe needs to be a consideration in sample preparation as well. The dried drop method is the simplest of deposition methods. The matrix and sample solution are mixed together and then a small drop of the mixture is placed on the sample probe surface and allowed to dry, thus crystallizing. The sandwich method involves depositing a layer of matrix onto the surface of the probe and allowing it to dry. A drop of the sample followed by a drop of additional matrix is then applied to the layer of dried matrix and allowed to dry as well. Variations on the sandwich technique involve depositing the matrix on the surface and then depositing the sample directly on top of the matrix. A particularly useful method involves depositing the matrix solution {{on the surface of}} the sample probe in a solvent that will evaporate very rapidly, thus forming a very thin fine layer of matrix. The sample solution is then placed on top of the matrix layer and allowed to evaporate slowly, thus integrating the sample into the top layer of matrix as the sample solution evaporates. An addition concern when depositing the sample {{on the surface of the}} probe is the solubility of the sample in the matrix. If the sample is insoluble in the matrix, additional methods must be employed. A method used in this case involves mechanical grinding and mixing of solid sample and <b>solid</b> <b>matrix</b> crystals. Once blended well, this powder can be deposited on the surface of the sample probe in free powder form or as a pill. Another possible method is placing the sample on the surface of the probe and applying vaporized matrix to the sample probe to allow the matrix to condense around the sample.|$|E
2500|$|The zero-phonon {{line and}} the phonon {{sideband}} jointly constitute the line shape of individual light absorbing and emitting molecules (chromophores) embedded into a transparent <b>solid</b> <b>matrix.</b> When the host matrix contains many chromophores, each will contribute a zero-phonon line and a phonon sideband to the absorption and emission spectra. [...] The spectra originating from a collection of identical chromophores in a matrix {{is said to be}} inhomogeneously broadened because each chromophore is surrounded by a somewhat different matrix environment which modifies the energy required for an electronic transition. In an inhomogeneous distribution of chromophores, individual zero-phonon line and phonon sideband positions are therefore shifted and overlapping.|$|E
