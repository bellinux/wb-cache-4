50|$|Carolina {{holds an}} in-state rivalry with fellow Tobacco Road school, North Carolina State University. Attention shifted back to Duke {{following}} {{a decline in}} NC State's basketball program <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970's</b> (and <b>the</b> resurgence of Duke's basketball program), but the rivalry is sometimes still considered the most bitter in the state. Combined, the two schools hold seven NCAA Championships and 27 ACC Championships in basketball. Students from each school often exchange pranks before basketball and football games.|$|R

5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} a biped, {{it has been suggested}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s</b> that Spinosaurus was at least an occasional quadruped. This has been bolstered by the discovery of Baryonyx, a relative with robust arms. Because of the mass of the hypothesized fatty dorsal humps of Spinosaurus, Bailey (1997) was open to the possibility of a quadrupedal posture, leading to new restorations of it as such. The hypothesis that Spinosaurus had a typical quadrupedal gait has fallen out of favor, though spinosaurids may have crouched in a quadrupedal posture.|$|E
5|$|Concussions are {{particularly}} concerning, as repeated concussions may increase a person's risk {{in later life}} for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, impact against the ground or other players' knees, and upper-body contact between opposing players. However, helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures. Cervical spine injuries can be catastrophic, but have sharply declined <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s</b> due to rule changes and improved workout regimes, equipment, and coaching.|$|E

5|$|Asiatic cheetah (A. j. venaticus) (Griffith, 1821): Also {{called the}} Iranian or Indian cheetah. Formerly {{occurred}} across the Middle East, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), it {{is confined to}} Iran, and is thus the only surviving cheetah subspecies indigenous to Asia. It has been classified as Critically Endangered. A 2004 study estimated the total population at 50 to 60. Later, a 2007 study gave the total population in Iran as 60 to 100; the majority of individuals {{were likely to be}} juveniles. The population has declined sharply <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s.</b> As of 2012, only two captive individuals are known.|$|E
5|$|Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman co-produced {{most of the}} Eon films until 1975, when Broccoli {{became the}} sole producer. The single {{exception}} during this period was Thunderball, on which Broccoli and Saltzman became executive producers while Kevin McClory produced. From 1984 Broccoli was joined by his stepson Michael G. Wilson as producer and in 1995 Broccoli stepped aside from Eon {{and was replaced by}} his daughter Barbara, who has co-produced with Wilson since. Broccoli's (and until 1975, Saltzman's) family company, Danjaq, has held ownership of the series through Eon, and maintained co-ownership with United Artists <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s.</b> The Eon series has seen continuity both in the main actors and in the production crews, with directors, writers, composers, production designers, and others employed through a number of films.|$|E
5|$|Hadspen {{has grown}} without any area {{set aside for}} small {{commercial}} operations, a fact {{that has led to}} just a single shopping complex. There was another service station, in the main street, but it closed in 2008 after operating for approximately forty years. Rutherglen is a holiday village, conference and event centre, and retirement village on the town's west. It is the only premises in Hadspen with a general liquor licence. Rutherglen, or a similarly named premises at the same location, has been used for accommodation since at least 1923. The town has access to reticulated water and sewerage. The town's sewerage has been, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s,</b> processed at a plant near Carrick that also serves that town. Treated waste-water from there is discharged into a tributary of the Liffey River.|$|E

5|$|Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan are {{considered}} attractive destinations by those seeking employment as domestic workers. According to Quartz, Hong Kong {{has one of}} the highest densities of foreign domestic workers in the world and its pay scale is a benchmark for other jurisdictions. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s,</b> when the foreign-domestic-helper policy was initiated, the number of workers has increased to around 300,000. At the end of 2013, there was an average of one foreign domestic worker for every eight households overall; in households with children, the average is one for every three. Foreign domestic helpers are about 10 percent of the working population. In December 2014 the number of migrant workers employed as helpers was over 330,000, 4.6 percent of the total population; the vast majority were female.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{search for}} Burgess Shale fossils <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s</b> {{has led to}} the description in the 1980s of an arthropod Sanctacaris and in 2007 of Orthrozanclus, which looked like a slug with a small shell at the front, chain mail over the back and long, curved spines round the edges. Recent digs have discovered species yet to be formally described and named. They have also unearthed more and sometimes better fossils of animals that were discovered earlier, for example Odontogriphus was for many years known from just one poorly preserved specimen, but the discovery of a further 189 formed the basis for a detailed description and analysis in 2006. Re-examination of Walcott's collection also continues, and {{has led to the}} reconstruction of the large marine animal Hurdia in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The governor's {{powers are}} {{enumerated}} {{in the state}} constitution. There have been four constitutions of Kentucky—adopted in 1792, 1799, 1850, and 1891, respectively—and each has enlarged the governor's authority. Among the powers appropriated to the governor in the constitution are the ability to grant pardons, veto legislation, and call the legislature into session. The governor serves as commander-in-chief of the state's military forces and is empowered to enforce all laws of the state. The officeholder is given broad statutory authority to make appointments to the various cabinets and departments of the executive branch, limited somewhat by {{the adoption of a}} merit system for state employees in 1960. Because Kentucky's governor controls so many appointments to commissions, the office has been historically {{considered one of the most}} powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, the governor's influence has been augmented by wide discretion in awarding state contracts and significant influence over the legislature, although the latter has been waning <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s.</b>|$|E

Before closing, the business came under criticism for allegedly encouraging drunk driving by some who {{did not understand the}} term's historic usage, but the name and the sign remain a conscious reminder of gay history.|$|R
5000|$|Although not {{designated}} until 1998, Main Street had essentially {{served as}} a [...] "Business 61" [...] <b>since</b> at least <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s,</b> when U.S. 61 was moved to a two-lane bypass around {{the south and west}} parts of the city.

5|$|The players' union became bolder {{under the}} {{leadership}} of former United Steelworkers chief economist and negotiator Marvin Miller, who was elected executive director in 1966. On the playing field, major league pitchers were becoming increasingly dominant again. After the 1968 season, in an effort to restore balance, the strike zone was reduced and the height of the pitcher's mound was lowered from 15 to 10 inches (38.1 - 25.4cm). In 1969, both the National and American Leagues added two more expansion teams, the leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, and a post-season playoff system leading to the World Series was instituted. Also that same year, Curt Flood of the St. Louis Cardinals made the first serious legal challenge to the reserve clause. The major leagues' first general players' strike took place in 1972, delaying the season's start for two weeks. In another effort to add more offense to the game, the American League adopted the designated hitter rule the following year. In 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system. In 1977, two more expansion teams joined the American League. Significant work stoppages occurred again in 1981 and 1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series {{for the first time in}} 90 years. Attendance had been growing steadily <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s</b> and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance.|$|E

50|$|<b>Since</b> {{at least}} <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s,</b> all U.S. states and Canadian provinces and territories {{have some sort}} of school bus traffic stop law; {{although}} each jurisdiction requires traffic to stop for a school bus loading and unloading passengers, different jurisdictions have different requirements of when to stop. Outside of North America, the school bus stopping traffic to unload and load children is not provided for. Instead of being given traffic priority, fellow drivers are encouraged to drive with extra caution around school buses.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Chamberlain had {{replaced}} his signature materials initially with galvanized steel, then with mineral-coated Plexiglas, and finally with aluminum foil. In 1966, he began a series of sculptures made of rolled, folded, and tied urethane foam. <b>Since</b> returning in <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s</b> to metal as his primary material, Chamberlain has limited himself to specific parts of the automobile (fenders, bumpers, or the chassis, for example). In 1973, two 300-pound metal pieces by Chamberlain were mistaken for junk and carted away as they sat outside a gallery warehouse in Chicago.|$|R
25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s,</b> {{large-scale}} emigration of Ethiopians {{has created}} a diaspora in the United States.

2500|$|Plans to {{construct}} a bypass of the village of Baldwinsville have existed in some form <b>since</b> at least <b>the</b> <b>mid-1970s.</b> Around that time, NYSDOT developed {{a proposal for a}} highway intended to divert traffic away from the Baldwinsville village center and provide access to Radisson, a planned community developed east of Baldwinsville by the New York State Urban Development Corporation. Several alignments of varying endpoints and length were considered by NYSDOT; however, all of the potential routes began south of Baldwinsville at NY690 and proceeded generally northeastward along the NY31 corridor to NY481 in the adjacent town of Clay. The 1988 New York Transportation Bond Act, dubbed [...] "Rebuild New York", provided funding for the design and planning stages of the project, and NYSDOT began gathering feedback on the project from the community in June 1991.|$|R
