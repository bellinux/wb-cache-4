5000|$|The Jim Henson Productions film Labyrinth centres {{around a}} kingdom of Goblins ruled by Jareth the Goblin King (played by David Bowie).

It has been implied by Jareth that all the Goblins were once human children.|$|R
5|$|After {{the start}} of the war with Japan, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an order for {{internment}} of all the people of Japanese ancestry who lived on the West Coast. About 1,700of them lived in Portland, and <b>some</b> <b>had</b> farms or businesses near the slough. When the government removed them from their homes in 1942, it housed them temporarily in the Livestock Exposition Center (Expo Center) in Kenton before sending them to internment camps further inland. They were not allowed to return until 1945.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{had only}} {{recently}} arrived {{in some of these}} kingdoms. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> been converted by the Gregorian mission, a group of Roman missionaries who arrived in Kent in 597 and who mainly influenced southern Britain. Others had been converted by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, chiefly Irish missionaries working in Northumbria and neighbouring kingdoms. A few kingdoms, such as Dál Riata, became Christian but how they did so is unknown. The native Picts, according to the medieval writer Bede, were converted in two stages, initially by native Britons under Ninian, and subsequently by Irish missionaries.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Major William A. Welch ordered 75 elk from Yellowstone National Park; however, <b>some</b> <b>had</b> died en route. The {{remaining}} elk {{were kept}} in a wired cage between Arden and Southfields. By 1935, some of the animals were still alive. However, by 1942, all of the elk had died. The remaining area {{is now known as}} the Elk's Pen Trailhead, which serves the Appalachian and ArdenSurebridge Trails. The remains of the pen still currently stand.|$|E

5|$|In Chicago, the Irish {{dominated}} {{social and}} athletic clubs that were {{closely tied to}} the political structure of the city. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> acted as enforcers for politicians. As the first major group of 19th-century European immigrants to settle in the city, the Irish had established formal and informal political strength. In Chicago, ethnic white gangs had been attacking people in African-American neighborhoods, and the police, overwhelmingly white and increasingly Irish-American, seemed little inclined to try to stop them. Meanwhile, newspapers carried sensational accounts of any African American allegedly involved in crime.|$|E

Pierce decided to allow each of the party's factions some appointments, even those that had not supported the Compromise of 1850.|$|E

5|$|Parliament finally {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} {{to hold the}} assembly on its own authority without Charles's assent on 12June 1643. It named as many as 121 ministers and thirty non-voting parliamentary observers: twenty from Commons, and ten from the House of Lords. The Assembly was almost entirely English; Parliament appointed Englishmen for the counties of Wales, but the French stranger churches (churches of Protestant refugees from Catholic France) sent two ministers in place of any from the Channel Islands. Many of the divines were internationally recognized scholars of the Bible, ancient languages, patristics, and scholastic theology. Many were also famous preachers. Most of these theologians had retained their positions in the Church during the tenure of William Laud. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> been ejected from their churches or cited by ecclesiastical courts for their views. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> fled to the Continent, and one to the American colonies. Nonetheless, they all considered themselves members of the Church of England and had received episcopal ordination. Most were conformists, meaning they agreed to follow the Act of Uniformity 1558 and the Book of Common Prayer.|$|E
5|$|Some United States Army Air Forces {{aircraft}} used {{a variation}} of the British camouflage schemes (mostly on aircraft originally built to RAF orders) but most USAAF aircraft did not use multiple shades on the top side of the aircraft. Instead, most were camouflaged in olive drab above and neutral gray below, though <b>some</b> <b>had</b> the edges of flying surfaces painted in medium green. In the later stages of the war camouflage was often dispensed with, both to save time in manufacturing and to reduce weight, leaving aircraft with a natural metal finish.|$|E

It added that police only intervened after exhausting all opportunities for dialogue and that lethal shots were fired only at armed protesters who attacked police officers. Security forces reported finding pistols, bullets, large quantities of knives, daggers, swords and other sharp objects, as well as Hezbollah flags at the site.|$|E

In fact the membership of the Second Continental Congress changed as time passed, and the figures in the painting were never in the same room at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The signals {{used were}} of the ancient disc and {{crossbar}} type, installed when the line opened and never modified. They remained in use up to the line's closure in 1898.

5|$|After Grant {{retired from}} the screen, he became more active in business. He {{accepted}} {{a position on the}} board of directors at Fabergé. This position was not honorary, as <b>some</b> <b>had</b> assumed; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them. His pay was modest in comparison to the millions of his film career, a salary of a reported $15,000 a year. Such was Grant's influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role in the growth of the firm to annual revenues of about $50 million in 1968, a growth of nearly 80% since the inaugural year in 1964. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother, Dyan Cannon, was working.|$|E
5|$|Among the Calvinists, {{who also}} {{included}} {{the lower classes}} and their leaders, ministers of common background, disagreements soon developed, based on different views {{in the areas of}} religious and social doctrines. The official split took place in 1562, when two separate churches were officially established: the mainstream Calvinist and the smaller, more reformist, Polish Brethren or Arians. The adherents of the radical wing of the Polish Brethren promoted, often by way of personal example, the ideas of social justice. Many Arians (such as Piotr of Goniądz and Jan Niemojewski) were pacifists opposed to private property, serfdom, state authority and military service; through communal living <b>some</b> <b>had</b> implemented the ideas of shared usage of the land and other property. A major Polish Brethren congregation and center of activities was established in 1569 in Raków near Kielce, and lasted until 1638, when Counter-Reformation had it closed. The notable Sandomierz Agreement of 1570, an act of compromise and cooperation among several Polish Protestant denominations, excluded the Arians, whose more moderate, larger faction {{toward the end of the}} century gained the upper hand within the movement.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{rebuilt the}} cafes into {{numerous}} configurations during the 1980s and 1990s.

By the 2010s most cafes were configured as club-dinettes; <b>some</b> <b>had</b> been converted into all-table dinettes. Five dinettes were rebuilt for use on the Inter-American, a long-distance train operating between Texas and St. Louis, Missouri; lounge seats replaced the coach seats. 21 dinettes were also refurbished for Metroliner service. By the 2010s all the remaining dinettes were rebuilt with all-table seating, save two which were converted into short-distance coaches.|$|E
