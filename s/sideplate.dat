5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged <b>sideplate</b> allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|According to Colt historian, R.L. Wilson, Colt Pythons {{have been}} {{collected}} by Elvis Presley and various kings in the traditional sense: [...] "H.M. (His Majesty) Hussein I of Jordan ordered {{a limited number of}} Pythons with 4-inch and 6-inch barrels, as gifts to his selected friends. Casing and barrel were embossed with His Majesty's crest. The Python for King Juan Carlos of Spain bore his name in flush gold on the <b>sideplate.</b> Among other celebrated recipients: King Khalid and Prince Fahd (Saudi Arabia), King Hassan (Morocco), Sheik Zayed (United Arab Emirates), President Anwar Sadat (Egypt) and President Hafez Assad (Syria)." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Redhawk was {{the first}} {{large-bore}} double-action revolver made by Ruger. It was designed by Harry Sefried, who previously worked for High Standard Manufacturing Company, where he designed the High Standard Sentinel revolver. [...] The grip profile of the Sentinel was used on the [...] "Six" [...] line of Ruger [...]357 double-action revolvers, which included the Ruger Security-Six and its variants, the Service-Six and Speed-Six. [...] These revolvers were produced from 1970 to 1988, and were unlike other double-action revolvers in that they used a one-piece frame, rather than a removable <b>sideplate,</b> which lent them superior strength. [...] The Redhawk, introduced in 1980, was a scaled-up and improved version of the Security-Six, the target model, with a square butt grip, adjustable sights, and 5.5- and 7.5-inch barrel lengths. [...] The Redhawk was available in blued or stainless steel, and was primarily used by handgun hunters. [...] The Redhawk, designed for long-term use with the heaviest [...]44 Magnum loads, included a new latch at the crane, to firmly lock the cylinder at front and rear, a feature last seen in the Smith & Wesson's triple lock design, discontinued in 1915.|$|E
50|$|Four of the British Rail Class 04 diesel {{locomotives}} were fitted with <b>sideplates</b> and cowcatchers for {{working on the}} Wisbech and Upwell Tramway.|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} {{were intended}} for {{service on the}} Wisbech and Upwell Tramway and had several tram engine features. These included cowcatchers and <b>sideplates</b> and a cab at each end.|$|R

50|$|Toby's cowcatchers and <b>sideplates</b> (that {{cover his}} wheels) mean he {{is ideal for}} taking stone trucks {{to and from the}} quarry at Ffarquhar, as the railway runs close to the road. Toby has his own coach, Henrietta, who is painted {{chocolate}} brown.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{the line}} used GER Class G15/LNER Class Y6 0-4-0T tram engines, which in {{accordance}} with Board of Trade regulations had <b>sideplates</b> and cowcatchers. These were replaced by more powerful 0-6-0T GER Class C53/LNER Class J70 and later by Drewry 0-6-0DM (Class 04) shunters. One coach survives.|$|R
50|$|Toby {{is based}} on a J70 tram engine from the Great Eastern Railway (GER Class C53). His cowcatchers and <b>sideplates</b> allow him to run on {{roadside}} tramways, which other engines are not allowed to do for safety reasons. J70s were used for light duties, such as branch line work and dock shunting.|$|R
5000|$|The View, {{also known}} as the model 85VTA, was {{introduced}} in 2014. It had a 1.41 inch barrel, an unloaded weight of 9 ounces, and a clear polycarbonate <b>sideplate.</b> Unlike other models, the View was only rated for standard pressure [...]38 Special ammunition.|$|E
50|$|The {{final version}} of these top-break {{double-action}} 38's was the Perfected Model. This version used a top break with a <b>sideplate</b> thumb latch and was made from 1909 until 1920 {{for a total of}} 59,400 revolvers. This model was used by Floyd Allen in a courthouse escape attempt in 1913.|$|E
50|$|Many 18th century European trade {{goods were}} also found at the site, {{including}} gun spalls and gunflints, gun parts (<b>sideplate,</b> mainspring, ram pipes, and breech plugs), wire-wound and drawn glass beads, tinkling cones, a button, pendants, an earring, cutlery, kettle ears, a key, nails, chisels, hooks, a buckle, a Jew's harp, and pieces {{of a pair of}} iron scissors.|$|E

50|$|Shortly thereafter, the M88 {{cartridge}} {{was converted}} to semi-smokeless powder. The new cartridge was designated 8mm M.1890 scharfe Patrone and its dimensions were 8×50mmR. The sights of existing black powder 8mm Mannlicher rifles {{were converted to}} accommodate semi-smokeless ammunition by the functional arrangement of screw mounting re-graduated <b>sideplates</b> onto the outsides of the existing rear sight walls. The converted rifles were denominated M.88-90.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conversions}} {{were performed}} from 1966 through 1967 at Naval Ordnance Station Louisville. Modified M1919A4s had the designation [...] "Machine Gun, 7.62mm / Mk 21 Mod 0" [...] stamped on the receiver <b>sideplate</b> in 1/4-inch lettering. The replacement barrels had [...] "7.62mm NATO-G" [...] stamped {{on them in}} 1/8-inch letters to differentiate them from M1919A4 or M60 barrels; the letter G indicated it used a grooved barrel bushing.|$|E
50|$|Several {{modifications}} to the original design, such as an improved extractor and bolt; a screw to retain the <b>sideplate</b> instead of a spring-loaded catch; and a new grip design extending {{the full length of}} the backstrap to the frame were made. The original grips were made of Trolit, a checkered plastic material similar to Bakelite. It was, however, prone to chipping and warping, and the majority of new 1910/21 models was fitted with checkered wooden grips.|$|E

40|$|Static {{pressure}} distributions {{and dark}} central ground interferometry {{are used to}} document the flow on a flap over a range of Reynolds numbers and deflection angles. The pressure profiles and interferograms are analyzed to distinguish laminar, transitional and turbulent flows in attached, incipient and separated cases. <b>Sideplates</b> are used to compare two and three dimensional effects. Data is also presented for extended flaps used to isolate {{the effect of the}} trailing edge expansion. The issues of unsteadiness and hysteresis are also addressed...|$|R
40|$|Gold-plated {{stainless-steel}} <b>sideplates,</b> {{part of a}} JPL Galileo spacecraft electronic-relay assembly, exhibited blistering after {{resistance spot}} welding. Unacceptable relays had heavy nonuniform gold electrodeposited layers with thicknesses 4. 5 - 11. 5 microns. SEM and metallographic investigations indicated much higher heat input generated during the resistance spot welding in unacceptable relays. The attributes of acceptable welded relays are contrasted with unacceptable relays; the possible mechanism of laminar formation of polymeric material in the gold plating is discussed; and some recommendations are provided to prevent similar problems...|$|R
5000|$|In late 1980, {{after three}} years of {{development}} the Dan Wesson company introduced a large-framed revolver in [...]44 Magnum/Special caliber, intended for hunters and target shooters (especially metal plate or silhouette target competitions). Designed for extended use with full-power magnum loads, the new Model 44 used a larger and stronger frame than the Smith & Wesson Model 29 (M44 weight was 48 ounces with a 4-inch barrel), and featured a solid frame without a separate <b>sideplate,</b> which also increased strength. [...] In addition to the one-piece frame, the Model 44 incorporated other new features designed to increase accuracy, such as broached rifling and choke-bored barrels.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic hip screw (DHS) or Sliding Screw Fixation {{is a type}} of {{orthopaedic}} implant designed for fixation of certain types of hip fractures which allows controlled dynamic sliding of the femoral head component along the construct. One common use is internal fixation of intertrochanteric fractures of the femur, which are common in older osteoporotic patients. There are 3 components of a dynamic hip screw, including a lag screw (inserted into the neck of the femur), a <b>sideplate</b> and four cortical screws (fixated into the proximal femoral shaft). The idea behind the dynamic compression is that the femoral head component is allowed to move along one plane; since bone responds to dynamic stresses, the native femur may undergo primary healing: cells join along boundaries, resulting in a robust joint requiring no remodeling.|$|E
5000|$|The Redhawk was {{the first}} {{large-bore}} double-action revolver made by Ruger.

5000|$|The {{military}} {{service of the}} M1917 did not end with the First World War. In 1937, Brazil ordered 25,000 Smith & Wesson M1917s for their military. [...] Now out of service, surplus examples can be identified by the large Brazilian crest stamped on their <b>sideplates.</b> They are {{sometimes referred to as}} the M1937 or the Brazilian-contract M1917. The Brazilian model had an altered rear sight, and most were fitted with commercial-style checkered grips, though some utilized smooth grips left over from the United States contract.|$|R
5000|$|Mavis is an 0-6-0 diesel-mechanical {{shunting}} engine. She {{belongs to}} the Ffarquhar Quarry Co. rather than the Fat Controller, and works mainly shunting stone trucks in their quarry. [...] She sometimes brings Toby's trucks down the line when he is busy. She is painted black, with yellow-and-black [...] "hazard" [...] stripes on her radiator and cab back. Mavis {{is based on a}} BR Class 04, some of which were fitted with the <b>sideplates</b> and cow-catcher for use on the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway, the same line that Toby came from. She was built and arrived on Sodor in 1962.|$|R
50|$|Chain wear, {{often called}} chain stretch, becomes {{an issue with}} {{extensive}} cycling. The wear is removal of material from the bushings and pins (or half-bushings, in the Sedis design) rather than elongation of the <b>sideplates.</b> The tension created by pedaling is insufficient to cause the latter. Because the spacing from link to link on a worn chain is longer than the 1/2 in specification, those links will not precisely fit the spaces between teeth on the sprockets, resulting in increased wear on the sprockets and possibly chain skip on derailleur drivetrains, in which pedaling tension causes the chain to slide up {{over the tops of}} the sprocket teeth and skip to the next alignment, that reduces power transfer and makes pedaling uncomfortable.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{chambered}} for an 8mm black-powder cartridge closely {{resembling the}} [...]32-20 WCF round, later models issued during World War I and thereafter fired the same 8mm cartridge loaded with smokeless powder. The Mle 1892 revolver is a double-action solid-frame design, with chambers being accessed by swinging out the cylinder to the right. The fired cases {{can then be}} pushed out of the cylinder at the same time. After reloading, the cylinder is swung back into the frame and locked into place with the case-hardened loading gate located {{on the right side}} of the frame. In addition, the left <b>sideplate</b> of the frame can be swung back on a hinge to give access to the gun's internal parts for oiling or cleaning. These parts were individually numbered to indicate the order in which they can be disassembled. The year of manufacture of each revolver is engraved {{on the right side of}} the barrel, for instance [...] "S 1895. The inscription [...] "Mle 1892 is hand engraved on top of the barrel. It was carried in a large closed leather holster, which held an additional 12 rounds of ammunition hidden below the flap.|$|E
5000|$|The Browning M1919 remains {{popular with}} {{civilian}} enthusiasts in the United States, though changes in 1986 to the National Firearms Act of 1934 (the US Federal law regulating private ownership of machine guns) prohibited the registration of new machine guns for sales to private citizens, thus freezing {{the number of}} [...] "transferable" [...] machine guns in private ownership. The inflation of prices that followed, {{and the availability of}} parts from surplussed and scrapped machine guns, {{led to the development of}} semi-automatic versions of the Browning M1919. Typically, these are built using a new right <b>sideplate</b> (the portion legally considered the [...] "firearm" [...] under US law), which has a raised [...] "island" [...] protruding into the interior of the receiver. This requires the use of a modified bolt, barrel extension and lock frame which have been designed to allow only semi-automatic firing. The [...] "island" [...] prevents the insertion of unmodified full-automatic parts. A number of small gun companies have produced these [...] "semi-auto machine guns" [...] for commercial sales. The fairly simple modifications necessary to convert M1919 parts to the semi-automatic version, and the relatively easy process of riveting used in the assembly of the Browning machine gun's receiver, have also made it a popular gun for hobbyists to build at home.|$|E
5000|$|The Security-Six and its {{variants}} {{were more}} or less identical in basic design, with minor differences in sights (fixed or adjustable) and frame (round or square butt). Although medium-framed in size, the Security-Six was somewhat stronger than competing guns like the Smith & Wesson Model 19 as the Ruger featured a thicker frame without a <b>sideplate</b> cutout, a stronger barrel shank support, That reported catastrophic barrel failure in the six inch model revolvers, larger, stronger internal parts, and an increased diameter cylinder with offset bolt locking notches. The new revolvers were initially manufactured in a blued carbon steel finish; in 1975 stainless steel versions of all models were added to the lineup. Featuring six-round cylinders, the Security-Six series represented one of the first modern revolver designs to feature a hammer powered by a coil spring utilizing a transfer-bar firing system, and was chambered for a variety of centerfire ammunition cartridges including [...]38 Special and [...]357 Magnum, as well as [...]38 S&W and 9×19mm Parabellum (9mm Luger). All Security-Six series revolvers came with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supplied service-style wooden grips. [...] The wood grips were all manufactured for Ruger by W.F. Lett Manufacturing in New Hampshire, a now-defunct contractor. Most of these wood grips featured a diamond-shaped panel of pressed checkering, though smooth walnut grips with uncheckered panels were shipped with some commemorative models. Oversized walnut target/combat grips were also available as a factory option. During the 1980s, some of the Speed- and Service-Six models were also shipped with rubber Pachmayr grips containing the silver Ruger emblem.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Thomas in Trouble", Thomas {{encounters}} an officious policeman, {{who says}} that, when {{running from the}} quarry, along public roads, engines who {{have the right to}} go on public roads must be fitted with cowcatchers and <b>sideplates</b> for safety to prevent people and animals from getting killed if they {{should have the right to}} stray onto the line. The Fat Controller, urgently needing to rectify this, is discussing the fitting of these, when Thomas remarks that [...] "everyone will laugh...they'll say I look like a tram". The Fat Controller (the [...] "stout gentleman") remembered Toby immediately and arranged for him to come to Sodor. Toby arrives with his coach, Henrietta, and became a friend of Thomas after Toby rings his bell and frightens the policeman.|$|R
25|$|T-55AM2 - T-55AM1 {{fitted with}} the passive BDD appliqué armour for turret (horseshoe shape) and hull front (fitted to upper glacis plate), <b>sideplates</b> fitted with {{extensions}} protecting catwalk fuel tanks, the improved V-55U engine with an integral supercharger delivering 620hp and the R-173P radio system. The BDD armour panels consist of armoured steel boxes filled with Penpolyurethane. In addition there are cavities {{which can be}} filled with water or sand for additional protection. The BDD armour panels consist of armoured steel boxes filled with Penpolyurethane and thin HHS steel plates. The BDD semi-reactive armor adding 120mm of protection against APDS and 200-250mm of protection against HEAT ammunition, thus these tanks had similar protection as early versions of T-72. There is also a cluster of 8 smoke-grenade launchers on the right-hand-side of turret. T-55AM2 is fitted with additional headlights on the front fenders.|$|R
50|$|As {{built the}} {{locomotives}} were originally numbered in the 300-series as F310-319, following {{on from the}} last of the S class diesel locomotives, S309, which entered service in February 1958, seven years after the arrival of the first F class locomotives. However, VR then placed a second order for another eight S class locomotives for use on the new North East standard gauge line which were delivered starting in November 1960. In order to vacate the 300-series numbers for the new mainline diesels, all F class locomotives were renumbered into the 200-series on in late May 1958 as F201-211. Unlike their British and Dutch counterparts, the F class locomotives were also later fitted with <b>sideplates</b> covering the side rods and wheel cranks. This modification was made to prevent staff from getting tangled up in the rods and cranks.|$|R
