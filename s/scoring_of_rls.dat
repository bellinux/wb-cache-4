40|$|The {{increased}} input <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> into LN starts within 3 h after {{antigenic stimulation}} and {{is due to}} {{an increase in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> passing through a LN. It is not associated with an altered transit time through a LN of the majority <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> and it cannot occur in the absence of high endothelial PCV. The immediate decrease in the output <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> from an antigen-stimulated LN is due to a delay in the exit from that LN <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> which had entered the LN before antigen was given. The decrease in cell output from a LN after antigen administration affects blast cells produced within the LN as well as small lymphocytes and is not specific for RL. There are at least two distinct mechanisms controlling the migration <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> through an antigen-stimulated LN. The first controls the increased input <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> which occurs only through high endothelial PCV. The second controls the immediate decrease in cell output, which although it does not occur at the level of the high endothelial PCV, can only occur in organized lymphoid tissue. The increased input <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> into an antigen-stimulated LN and the decreased cell output from the LN can occur independently and are possibly controlled by different mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the of the}} key {{barriers}} that hampers effective and efficient management of reverse flows detected within a number of empirical surveys and case studies focused on reverse logistics and/or return management is business (organisational) policy, specifically lack of policy, deficiency in existing policy or inferior policy. Despite this fact, there is a gap in literature which would show some evidence from practice that innovative reverse logistics policy both can pay off and is associated with certain aspects of reverse logistics management. Such proof can have several implications. It can support the call for better understanding and more research of the linkages of reverse logistics with other corporate functions, promote the acceptation of strategic character of reverse logistics and stress the role <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> policy within the rest of overall corporate management.

It was shown that the displayed peptide T 3 provides binding and internalization of phage particles by MDA-MB- 231 cells and their specific accumulation in MDA-MB- 231 tumor tissue. In addition, based on the nucleotide sequences coding RL 2 and the known tumor-targeting peptide iRGD, we obtained genetic constructs that provide synthesis <b>of</b> fusion proteins <b>RL</b> 2 -iRGD and RL-iRGD-His.

40|$|The X-ray {{emission}} <b>of</b> radio-loud (<b>RL)</b> AGNs is {{a powerful}} tool for probing the structure of the accretion flow in these objects. We review recent spectral and variability studies <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> AGNs, which show that these systems have systematically different X-ray properties than their radio-quiet (RQ) counterparts. Specifically, RL AGNs have weaker and narrower Fe K lines and weaker Compton reflection components above 10 keV. The nuclear continuum <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> AGNs in the 2 [...] 10 keV band is well described by a power law with photon indices ∼ 1. 8, similar to RQ AGNs of comparable X-ray luminosity. RL AGNs have little or no flux variability on short time scales (0. 5 days); however, flux and spectral variations are observed on time scales of weeks in two well-monitored objects, 3 C 390. 3 and 3 C 120. These properties strongly suggest that the central engines of the two AGNs classes are different. We discuss the implications of these observational results, in particular the possibility that the central engines <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> AGNs are harbor an ion torus (also known as an Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow or ADAF). We show that a beamed component from the jet is unlikely in the majority of sources. Moreover, the X-ray data provide evidence that the circumnuclear environs <b>of</b> <b>RL</b> and RQ AGNs also differ: large amounts of cold gas are detected in BLRGs and QSRs, contrary to Seyfert galaxies of similar X-ray luminosity where an ionized absorber seems to be the norm.

Both of these issues are addressed in this paper by using the gradient-descent Sarsa(λ) method together with a Normalised Radial Basis Function neural net. The experimental results on three typical benchmark control tasks show that these methods outperform most previously reported results on these tasks, while remaining computationally feasible to implement even as embedded software.
