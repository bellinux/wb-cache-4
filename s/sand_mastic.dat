40|$|Abstract A micromechanical {{finite element}} (FE) {{framework}} {{was developed to}} predict the viscoelastic properties (complex modulus and creep stiffness) of the asphalt mixtures. The two-dimensional (2 D) microstructure of an asphalt mixture {{was obtained from the}} scanned image. In the mixture microstruc-ture, irregular aggregates and <b>sand</b> <b>mastic</b> were divided into different subdomains. The FE mesh was generated within each aggregate and mastic subdomain. The aggregate and mastic elements share nodes on the aggregate boundaries for deformation connectivity. Then the viscoelastic mastic with specified properties was incorporated with elastic aggregates to predict the viscoelastic properties of asphalt mixtures. The viscoelastic <b>sand</b> <b>mastic</b> and elastic aggregate properties were inputted into mi-cromechanical FE models. The FE simulation was conducted on a computational sample to predict complex (dynamic) modulus and creep stiffness. The complex modulus predictions have good correlations with laboratory uniaxial compression test under a range of loading frequencies. The creep stiffness prediction over a period of reduced time yields favorable comparison with specimen test data. These comparison results indicate that this micromechanical model is capable of predicting the viscoelastic mixture behavior based on ingredient properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) mixes are often characterized by its viscoelastic behavior. Viscoelasticity {{coupled with the}} thermo-mechanical nature of asphalt offers time-temperature dependence to the {{mechanical properties}} of HMA mixes. Also, {{the wide range of}} distribution of particles, and several orders of magnitude of differences in the mechanical properties between constituents cause a wide range of stress and strain distribution within the microstructure. In this paper, micromechanical modeling has been performed to study the relationship between individual material properties, their interaction within the microstructure, and the macroscopic properties of HMA mix. The analytical model based on N phase self-consistent scheme allows calculating the complex modulus and phase angle of HMA mixes from the mechanical properties of its constituents and designed mix data. In the mix microstructure, aggregates and sand are classified using simple sieve analysis test. Asphalt and <b>sand</b> <b>mastic</b> film thicknesses around the aggregates are calculated for each class and introduced into the model...|$|E
