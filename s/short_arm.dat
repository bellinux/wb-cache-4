5|$|In 1982, Singh and {{his colleagues}} {{discovered}} that a tiny portion of the <b>short</b> <b>arm</b> of sex-determining Y chromosome was necessary and sufficient to convert a female mouse to male. This fundamental discovery provided a new concept of Chromosomal translocation of sex-determining region from Y chromosome to X chromosomes causing sex reversal in mice. These findings later became {{the foundation for the}} discovery of a similar phenomenon of sex reversal in humans.|$|E

5|$|The {{karyotype}} contains 52chromosomes with a {{total of}} 58major arms (2n=52, FN=58). The non-sex chromosomes (autosomes) are mostly acrocentric, having a long and a <b>short</b> <b>arm,</b> or telocentric, having only one arm, but there are also three large metacentric pairs, which have two major arms, and a small metacentric pair. The Y chromosome is metacentric and the X chromosome is variable, ranging from nearly metacentric to acrocentric in five specimens studied.|$|E
5|$|HD is one {{of several}} trinucleotide repeat {{disorders}} which are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range. The HTT gene is located on the <b>short</b> <b>arm</b> of chromosome 4 at 4p16.3. HTT contains a sequence of three DNA bases—cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)—repeated multiple times (i.e.... CAGCAGCAG...), known as a trinucleotide repeat. CAG is the 3-letter genetic code (codon) for the amino acid glutamine, so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a polyglutamine tract (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the PolyQ region.|$|E
5|$|The LDL {{receptor}} gene {{is located}} on the <b>short</b> <b>arm</b> of chromosome 19 (19p13.1-13.3). It comprises 18 exons and spans 45 kb, and the protein gene product contains 839 amino acids in mature form. A single abnormal copy (heterozygote) of FH causes cardiovascular disease by the age of 50 in about 40% of cases. Having two abnormal copies (homozygote) causes accelerated atherosclerosis in childhood, including its complications. The plasma LDL levels are inversely related to the activity of LDL receptor (LDLR). Homozygotes have LDLR activity of less than 2%, while heterozygotes have defective LDL processing with receptor activity being 2–25%, depending {{on the nature of the}} mutation. Over 1000 different mutations are known.|$|E

40|$|The {{nature and}} {{location}} of carbohydrate moieties on the laminin molecule were identified by studying the binding affinity {{of a series of}} lectins for purified, proteasederived fragments of laminin. Laminin is a cross-shaped molecule containing three <b>short</b> <b>arms</b> (36 nm) and one long arm (76 nm). All arms contain globular end regions by electron microscopy. Purified fragments of laminin were obtained which (a) lacked the long arm of the molecule but retained the intact <b>short</b> <b>arms,</b> or (b) lacked both the long arm and the globular end regions of the <b>short</b> <b>arms.</b> These two types of fragments differed markedly in lectin-binding capacity. Using the known sugar specificities of the lectins and hapten sugar competition for lectin-binding to laminin fragments, the following conclusions were reached: (a) [alpha] [...] Galactopyranosyl end groups are markedly enriched in the globular end regions of the <b>short</b> <b>arms</b> compared to the rod-shaped portions of the molecule. (b) [alpha] [...] Mannopyranosyl residues are present on both the globular end regions and the rod-shaped portions of the molecule. (c) Exposed N-acetyl [...] galactosaminyl end groups are absent or present in low amounts on laminin. (d) (NANA) -(2 [...] > 6) -[beta] [...] Gal-(1 [...] > 4) -[beta] [...] GlcNAc-(1 [...] > 2) [...] Man-terminated oligosaccharide units are enriched on the rod-shaped regions of the <b>short</b> <b>arms</b> compared to the globular end regions...|$|R
5|$|The {{karyotype}} in T.talamancae is variable. Samples {{from two}} different localities in Venezuela have 34chromosomes and a fundamental number of 64 chromosomal arms (2n=34, FN=64). Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality each have a different karyotype, {{with the number of}} chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67. The autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) of the 2n=34 karyotype all have two major arms, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes include several acrocentric autosomes, which only have one major arm. The 2n=34 karyotype includes two large submetacentric pairs, which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other, and one pair of subtelocentric chromosomes, with a long and a much shorter arm, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of subtelocentrics. Both Robertsonian translocations (fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the <b>short</b> <b>arm</b> of the one with the <b>short</b> <b>arm</b> of the other) and pericentric inversions (reversals of part of a chromosome that includes the centromere) are needed to explain {{the difference between the two}} groups. Musser and colleagues, in discussing these karyotypes, assumed that the 2n=40–42 sample was from within a hybrid zone between two karyotypic morphs.|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} <b>short</b> <b>arm</b> of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E

5000|$|A Robertsonian {{translocation}} {{results when}} the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes fuse at the centromere {{and the two}} <b>short</b> <b>arms</b> are lost. If, for example, the long arms of chromosomes 13 and 14 fuse, no significant genetic material is lost - and the person is completely normal {{in spite of the}} translocation. Common Robertsonian translocations are confined to the acrocentric chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22, because the <b>short</b> <b>arms</b> of these chromosomes encode for rRNA which is present in multiple copies.|$|R
40|$|Netrins {{were first}} {{identified}} as neural guidance molecules, acting through receptors that {{are members of}} the DCC and UNC- 5 family. All netrins share structural homology to the laminin N-terminal domains and the laminin epidermal growth factor-like domains of laminin <b>short</b> <b>arms.</b> Laminins use these domains to self-assemble into complex networks. Here we demonstrate that netrin- 4 is a component of basement membranes and is integrated into the laminin polymer via interactions with the laminin 1 and 3 <b>short</b> <b>arms.</b> The binding is mediated through the laminin N-terminal domain of netrin- 4. In contrast to netrin- 4, other members of the netrin family do not bind to these laminin <b>short</b> <b>arms.</b> Moreover, a truncated form of netrin- 4 completely inhibits laminin- 111 self-assembly in vitro, and full-length netrin- 4 can partially disrupt laminin self-interactions. When added to explant cultures, netrin- 4 retards salivary gland branching morphogenesis...|$|R

40|$|We study {{photometric}} properties, chemical abundances {{and sizes}} {{of star formation}} regions in the two principal arms of the galaxy NGC 628 (M 74). The GALEX ultraviolet, optical UBVRI, and H-alpha? surface photometry data are used, including those obtained with the 1. 5 -m telescope of the Maidanak Observatory. The thirty brightest star formation regions in ultraviolet light located in the spiral arms of NGC 628 are identified and studied. We find that the star formation regions in one (longer) arm are systematically brighter and larger than the regions in the other (<b>shorter)</b> <b>arm.</b> However, both luminosity and size distribution functions have approximately the same slopes for the samples of star formation regions in both arms. The star formation regions in the longer arm have a higher star formation rate density than the regions in the <b>shorter</b> <b>arm.</b> The regions in the <b>shorter</b> <b>arm</b> show higher N/O ratio at a higher oxygen abundance, but they have lower ultraviolet and H-alpha? luminosities. These findings can be explained {{if we assume that}} star formation regions in the <b>shorter</b> <b>arm</b> had higher star formation rate in the past, but now it is lower than for those in the opposite arm. Results of stellar evolutionary synthesis show that the brightest regions in the longer arm are slightly younger than the ones in the <b>shorter</b> <b>arm</b> (3. 5 +- 2. 2 Myr versus 6. 0 +- 1. 1 Myr). Our results demonstrate that there is a difference in the inner structures and parameters of the interstellar medium between the spiral arms of NGC 628, one of which is long and hosts a regular chain of bright star formation complexes and the other, shorter one does not.
