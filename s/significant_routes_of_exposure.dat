40|$|AbstractDecamethylcyclopenta{{siloxane}} (D 5) is a low-molecular-weight cyclic siloxane {{used primarily}} {{as an intermediate}} {{in the production of}} several widely-used industrial and consumer products and intentionally added to consumer products, personal products and some dry cleaning solvents. The global use requires consideration of consumer use information and risk assessment requirements from various sources and authoritative bodies. A global “harmonized” risk assessment was conducted to meet requirements for substance-specific risk assessments conducted by regulatory agencies such as USEPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), Health Canada and various independent scientific committees of the European Commission, as well as provide guidance for chemical safety assessments under REACH in Europe, and other relevant authoritative bodies. This risk assessment incorporates global exposure information combined with a Monte Carlo analysis to determine the most <b>significant</b> <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> utilization of a multi-species, multi-route physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to estimate internal dose metrics, benchmark modeling to determine a point of departure (POD), and a margin of safety (MOS) evaluation to compare the estimates of intake with the POD. Because of the specific pharmacokinetic behaviors of D 5 including high lipophilicity, high volatility with low blood-to-air partition coefficients and extensive metabolic clearance that regulate tissue dose after exposure, the use of a PBPK model was essential to provide a comparison of a dose metric that reflects these processes. The characterization of the potential for adverse effects after exposure to D 5 using a MOS approach based on an internal dose metric removes the subjective application of uncertainty factors that may be applied across various regulatory agencies and allows examination of the differences between internal dose metrics associated with exposure and those associated with adverse effects...|$|E
30|$|Literature data {{indicate}} that terrestrial life stages of amphibians may {{be more sensitive to}} xenobiotics than birds or mammals. It is hypothesized that dermal exposure could potentially be a <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> for amphibians, as there is evidence that their skin is more permeable than the skin of other vertebrate species. Thus, higher amounts of xenobiotics might enter systemic circulation by dermal uptake resulting in adverse effects. Heretofore, no guidelines exist to investigate dermal toxicity of chemicals to amphibians. In order to minimize vertebrate testing, this work was targeted to develop an in vitro test system as a possible model to assess the dermal uptake of chemicals across amphibian skin.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} diet as a source <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to toxic metals for residents of the El Paso-Juarez border region. Our project comprised these two main thrusts: 1) Establish by survey the patterns of food, utensil, and medicinal consumption by border residents. 2) Determine the levels of toxic metals and other elements in those foods, utensils, and medicinals by analysis by ICP-MS. We examined samples of both US and Mexican manufacture and origin, and paid particular attention to popular Mexican products which are commercially imported or purchased by individuals for consumption in the US. We expected this study to document whether diet is a <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to toxic metals in our border population. The project {{also serves as a}} watchdog and a mechanism for alerting appropriate health agencies to products substantiated to be hazardous.

40|$|Background: Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) are additive {{flame retardants}} which {{are found in}} household and commercial products. These chemicals {{have the potential to}} leach from the product into the environment. Human health effects include neurodevelopmental changes, low birth weight and thyroid hormone changes have also been reported, although continued research in this field is needed. Humans are exposed to PBDEs through various exposure pathways and recent studies have determined that exposure to household dust is also a <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> for humans.

30|$|Presentations in {{this session}} focused {{exclusively}} on bees and amphibians. It {{was evident that}} there is a need for additional toxicity testing methods for these groups. Annette Aldrich (Agroscope, Wädenswil, Switzerland) reported that amphibians are experiencing increasing pressure from diverse stressors, in particular loss of habitat, and plant protection products (PPP). The data requirement for authorization of PPP in the European Union (EU 283 / 2013) determines that amphibians must be considered to be in prospective environmental risk assessment. However, amphibians do not need to be tested for PPP authorization; therefore, there is a lack of information regarding PPP toxicity to this group. Dermal uptake is considered to be a <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> but so far there is no adequate testing system. Katharina Kaufmann (BASF SE, Limburgerhof, Germany) presented the results of a skin absorption in vitro test (OECD TG 428), which was adapted to amphibian skin (Xenopus laevis). Dermal absorption and uptake were quantified using two reference substances, caffeine and testosterone. To address dermal toxicity, an amphibian skin corrosion test based on OECD TG 431 was successfully used. Her studies showed that amphibian skin was significantly more permeable for chemicals than human skin.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeven mother-pup {{pairs of}} harp seal (Phoca groenlandica) were sampled during the {{lactation}} season near Magdalen Islands, QC, Canada. The blubber and serum of pups and mothers {{as well as}} the milk of mothers were analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers and several chlorinated persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to evaluate their transfer prior to weaning. Principal component analysis demonstrated significant variations in contaminant distribution patterns between seal tissues of mothers and pups. The selectivity in the transfer of POPs between mothers and pups appeared mainly driven by their log K(ow) (octanol/water partition coefficient). The most selective transfer step for the POPs examined occurred between the blubber and the serum of the mother. A novel approach to examine temporal changes of POP concentrations in tissues of seals which take into account the contamination of mothers was developed. A general decrease of POP concentrations in pup tissues throughout lactation may suggest a growth dilution. A concomitant rise of POP concentrations was observed in maternal blubber and serum and in milk as lactation progresses. The intensive offloading of contaminants via lactation constitutes a major but selective excretory route for reproductive female seals and also a <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> for suckling pup seals...|$|R

In order to investigate if food consumption would possibly be a <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> we developed a method for the measurement of Dechloranes in food and feed. We showed {{that it was possible}} to extend the scope of the regular polychlorinated dibenzo-. p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), dioxin like (DL-), and non-dioxin like (NDL-) regulated PCBs clean-up and fractionation procedure to Dechloranes and that no compound degradation occurred during the strong acidic treatments used for lipid digestion. Dechloranes were measured by gas chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QQQMS/MS). We optimized injection parameters by face centered experimental design (FCD). The electron ionization fragmentation was investigated to set appropriate multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions. Instrumental and method limits of quantitation (iLOQs and mLOQs) were determined following EU guidelines for dioxin analyses in food. A total of 88 samples were analyzed to assess the prevalence <b>of</b> this <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to humans. Average levels of the sum of Dechloranes ranged from 10 to 31. pg/g fat, with the exception of fish, feed additives, and corn that were reported in pg/g wet weight at average levels of 9, 12, and 2. pg/g ww. Based on Belgian food habits, a dietary intake was estimated to be 136. pg/day.

40|$|Ba c k g r o u n d: In {{many parts}} of the world, {{deliberate}} indoor residual spraying (IRS) of dwellings with insecticides to control malaria transmission remains the only viable option, thereby unintentionally but inevitably also causing exposure to inhabitants. Because mothers are exposed to insecticides via various routes, accumulated residues are transferred to infants via breast milk, in some cases exceeding recommended intake levels. Except for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), safety of residues of other insecticides in breast milk has not been considered during World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) evaluations. However, very little is known of the health risks posed by these chemicals to infants who, in developing countries, breast-feed for up to 2 years. Objective: We evaluated the need for WHOPES to include breast milk as a potentially <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> and risk to infants when evaluating the risks during evaluation of IRS insecticides. Discussion: We present evidence showing that neurologic and endocrine effects are associated with pyrethroids and DDT at levels equal or below known levels in breast milk. Co n c l u s i o n s: Because millions of people in malaria control areas experience conditions of multiple sources and <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to any number of insecticides, even though lives are saved through malaria prevention, identification of potential infant health risks associated with insecticide residues in breast milk must be incorporated in WHOPES evaluations and in the development of appropriate risk assessment tools.

40|$|According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), fish {{consumption}} {{is the most}} <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> mercury <b>exposure,</b> and the concern is greatest for {{women of childbearing age}} due to the potential for neurodevelopmental effects on a developing fetus. Rates of developmental disorders vary. But in 2008 it was demonstrated that the rate of autism is higher near industries that emit heavy metals. Furthermore past research findings can be taken to show that where a pregnancy occurred may predict later autism likelihood in the offspring more than where diagnosis occurs. If mercury plays any role in developmental disabilities, the rate of disability should relate to any reliable direct measure of contamination. The current research focuses on one index of environmental mercury contamination. Specifically, mercury-related fish advisories are found to be a surprisingly strong predictor of a state’s autism rate, r = 0. 48, p < 0. 001. The relationship remains strong after controlling for student to teacher ratio and per pupil spending. It is argued that a secular increase in autism has been occurring and that prenatal exposure to heavy metal toxins may play a significant role. Because we suspect this finding may be of some interest, the full data set is provided in the appendix so that researchers can independently analyze the key findings which rely on CDC, EPA and IDEA data sets...|$|R
40|$|The concentration-limit {{guidelines}} {{presented in}} this document apply to airborne releases of chemicals evaluated with respect to human health effects {{for the purposes of}} hazard classification and categorization, risk assessment and safety analysis. They apply to all DOE facilities and operations involving the use of potentially hazardous chemicals. The guidelines do not address other nonradiological hazards such as fire, pressure releases (including explosions), and chemical reactivity, but the guidelines are applicable to hazardous chemical releases resulting from these events. This report presents the subcommittee`s evaluation and recommendations regarding analyses of accidentally released toxic chemicals. The premise upon which these recommendations are based is that the mechanism of action of toxic chemicals is fundamentally different from that associated with radionuclides, with the exception of carcinogens. The recommendations reported herein are restricted to the airborne pathway because in an accident scenario this typically represents the most immediately <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> public <b>exposure.</b> However, the subcommittee recognizes that exposure to chemicals through other pathways, in particular waterborne, can have significant impacts on human health and the environment.

40|$|Although the {{production}} of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) technical mixtures has been banned in the U. S. since the 70 ’s, they remain ubiquitous in the environment, particularly in indoor and ambient air. Due {{to the presence of}} PCB’s in air, inhalation is a <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> PCBs released from various building materials have been shown to contaminate the indoor air in homes and schools. In the AESOP Study, an epidemiologic study <b>of</b> PCB <b>exposures</b> among school children and their mothers, PCB 28 was found in the serum of over 20 % of participants. Data are lacking on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of inhaled PCBs and on the biological fate and dose-specific toxicological endpoints. In order to inform toxicokinetic modeling for risk-assessment, we are conducting ADME toxicological studies with lung exposure to a representative trichlorobiphenyl, and evaluating the uptake from the lung and the distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to [14 C]PCB 28 via intratracheal instillation at two different doses (42 µg/rat and 4. 2 µg/rat). Digestive matter from five separate compartments of the gastrointestinal tract and thirty-six tissue types were excised and measured by scintillation counting. Exhaled air and excreta were also collected and analyzed. Measurements for the high dose were made at 12, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 720, and 1440 min, and for the low dose at 2, 12, 50, 200, and 720 min post-exposure. Data show that pulmonary uptake exceeded 99 % in both doses. [14 C]PCB 28 entered the blood stream and distributed quickly to all tissues within minutes of dosing. In the high dose, the majority of radioactivity initially went to the muscle and liver, while in the low dose [14 C]PCB 28 initially distributed to the muscle, esophagus, and trachea, before being redistributed to the skin and adipose tissue, where it accumulated in both doses. In most tissues, elimination was biphasic, consisting of an initial fast phase with a half-life (t 1 / 2) of 7 - 93 min (high dose) and t 1 / 2 of 6 - 60 min (low dose), followed by a slower phase with t 1 / 2 of 5 - 18 hours (high dose) and t 1 / 2 of 3 - 18 hours (low dose). The metabolism of PCB 28 was not extensive, with the parent compound as the major component in liver, kidney, serum, and adipose tissue. Excretion via urine and feces was limited, with 92 % (high dose) and 88 % (low dose) of radioactivity remaining in the tissues {{by the end of the}} time course, primarily in skin and adipose tissue. Low urinary concentration relative to serum, suggested that parent PCB 28 in serum would serve as an accurate biomarker for assessment <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to inhaled trichlorobiphenyls. The time course and tissue distribution is comparable to [14 C]PCB 11, while metabolism and excretion of [14 C]PCB 28 is much less extensive...|$|R
40|$|The {{proportion}} of fine and very fine particles (PM 2. 5 and PM 1) emitted {{into the atmosphere}} has significantly increased in industrial areas, since more efficient filters towards coarse particles size fraction are set up in chimney exit facilities. These fine and very fine particles are very reactive and may represent a significant risk for human health and may contaminate the surrounding environments (air, soil, water, vegetable). The micronic and submicronic particles can deeply penetrate into the respiratory system and reach alveoli. Ingestion also represents a <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> particles <b>exposure</b> through the consumption of contaminated vegetables. Studying the accumulation and transfer of particles trough foliar way in vegetables cultivated near factories emitting metal-rich particles is therefore of major interest. This work concerns the study of foliar accumulation of particles emitted by a lead battery recycling facility and their transfer into the leaf tissues. First, particles were characterized at the particle scale through the coupling of imaging and spectroscopic techniques. Results show that lead is predominantly found in finer size fraction (PM 1), mainly as sulfate compounds. We have demonstrated the formation of soluble lead compounds on the particles surface.

40|$|A major {{weakness}} {{in evaluating the}} suitability of a biomonitor organism is the poor ability to predict the variability of the bioavailability of metals from measured environmental concentrations. In this study, the intertidal gastropod Hydrobia ulvae {{was used to evaluate}} its suitability as a test organism for assessing sediment metal toxicity. Toxicity tests were run with sediments spiked with copper, cadmium and zinc applied both as single metal and as a mixture to investigate toxicological interactions evaluating different lethal and sublethal effects. Dose-response relationships were constructed based both on tissue residue approach and particulate metal concentrations. Because metal-spiked sediments used in routine toxicity tests often do not exhibit the same adsorption/desorption kinetics as the natural sediments, the laboratory results were compared to 10 -d bioassays conducted with natural field sediments collected from the Guadalete estuary (SW Spain). Highly significant correlations between tissue residue concentrations and particulate metal concentrations were found for all metal-spiked or field-collected and demonstrated that: (i) H. ulvae readily accumulated copper and cadmium in response to contamination and (ii) dietary uptake was determined to be the most <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> metal <b>exposure.</b> The comparison <b>of</b> the modeled tissue residue-response curve developed from the mixture tests was in good agreement with the results from the bioassay conducted with field sediments and strongly demonstrated that H. ulvae is also a suitable test organism for assessing copper sediment toxicity.

40|$|Country {{food is a}} {{cornerstone}} of cultural, social, and spiritual life for Inuit communities (Gombay, 2005; Van Oostdam et al., 2005). Country foods refer to marine mammals, fish, plants, berries, seabirds and wild game that have been hunted and gathered from the local area (Van Oostdam et al., 2005). These country foods are a <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to many environmental contaminants, including mercury (Hg) (Donaldson et al., 2010; Van Oostdam et al., 2005). Mercury can be very detrimental to human health through adverse cardiovascular, endocrine and neurotoxic effects, especially in vulnerable populations such as the elderly or pregnant women (Clarkson and Magos, 2006; Zahir et al., 2005). Despite being a major route for Hg exposure, country foods are very nutritious and contain high levels of numerous vitamins and minerals including the essential micronutrient – selenium (Se), which can potentially mitigate Hg toxicity (Kuhnlein and Receveur, 2007, 1996). An in vitro gastrointestinal model was used to estimate the in vitro bioaccessibility (IVBA) of Hg and Se in certain country foods. We used an in vitro gastrointestinal model to determine the Hg and Se in vitro bioaccessibility for country foods collected from Nunavik, Quebec that have been digested separately and in combination (i. e. single digest and co-digest, respectively). These country food samples were collected 2008 - 2013 through the community-based sampling programs overseen by the Nunavik Research Centre of the Makivik Corporation. The purpose of this thesis was to determine: (1) 	Do the Inuit country foods that {{have high levels of}} Hg also have high levels of Se? (2) 	Does the bioaccessibility of Hg and Se vary from one country food to another? (3) 	Can the co-consumption of specific food combinations affect the solubilization of Hg within the GI tract? For the single digest country foods, we evaluated Hg and Se in vitro bioaccessibility (IVBA) using a two-stage in vitro gastro-intestinal (GI) model for a variety of country foods harvested in Nunavik, Québec. By assessing the IVBA (i. e. the metal fraction of that would is soluble in the gut lumen), we can approximate metal bioavailability (i. e. the metal fraction o that would cross the gut-blood barrier and reach systemic circulation). The results showed a large variation in Hg (1. 4 - 90 %) and Se (29 - 108 %) bioaccessibility for the country foods studied. The samples with the highest Hg concentration (ringed seal liver) also had the lowest Hg percent bioaccessibility. Generally, Se:Hg molar ratios for the majority of country foods increased and they were greater than one after accounting for metal bioaccessibility (i. e. Se bioaccessibility > Hg bioaccessibility). The main exceptions to this trend included the muscle and liver of ringed seals, which showed similar Se:Hg ratios before and after accounting for metal bioaccessibility. Some foods were also co-digested (or co-consumed) meaning they were digested together in the GI model. For the co-digested country foods, we evaluated the Hg and Se in vitro bioaccessibility (IVBA) using a two-stage in vitro gastrointestinal (GI) model for selected country foods. We compared country foods with high levels of total and IVBA Hg (i. e. ringed seal liver, beluga nikku, raw beluga meat, walrus, lake trout, eider duck egg white) and pair them with country foods that may have a mitigating effect on Hg IVBA (i. e. crowberries, blueberries, seaweed, sculpin eggs and tomato paste). Overall, our results show that there are no additive or subadditive results for IVBA Hg when foods were digested together. In the future, this research may aid in the ongoing contaminant exposure assessments in Nunavik and assist in the development of culturally relevant strategies promoting country food use while decreasing Hg body burden...|$|R
40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a {{class of}} {{persistent}} organic pollutants that {{have been associated with}} a myriad of negative human health effects. These man-made compounds were used throughout most of the 20 th century and although their intentional production has since been banned and their use limited to closed systems, their prevalence in the environment remains a factor in disease states for exposed populations. The worldwide levels of PCBs has been declining, however, there is evidence for renewed sources of these compounds. The presence of PCBs with lower numbers of chlorine atoms (LC-PCBs) have been verified as unintentional byproducts in paints and pigments, the decomposition of PCB waste, or the recycling or disposal attempts of PCB-laden materials. While exposure to the higher chlorinated congeners (HC-PCBs) is often attributed to the consumption of contaminated water or fatty animal meat, a <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to the airborne LC-PCBs is through inhalation. These semi-volatile compounds have been detected in high quantities in both indoor and outdoor air in urban and rural communities, and their presence is pronounced in older buildings (e. g., homes and schools). When compared to HC-PCBs, LC-PCBs are more highly susceptible to metabolic transformations, and recently their sulfated metabolites have gained much interest. Although the sulfation of xenobiotics often is considered a route for their removal from the body, a previous study of Sprague-Dawley rats treated with 4 -chlorobiphenyl (PCB 3) resulted in the substantial formation of sulfated metabolites (i. e., hydroxylation followed by sulfation of the LC-PCB). This metabolic route accounted {{for more than half of}} the treatment dose. Furthermore, LC-PCB sulfates have been shown to bind to the human serum protein, transthyretin, in vitro. Of the health effects associated with PCB exposure, neurotoxicity has been well established through various laboratory and epidemiological studies. It is proposed that the dopaminergic system lies at the core of the observed cognitive, motor, and intellectual dysfunction observed in exposed populations, especially in children exposed perinatally. Interestingly, PCB exposure has been linked to Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD) etiology, which is marked by a substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons. This thesis describes studies on the binding of selected LC-PCBs and their hydroxylated and sulfated metabolites to human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in human serum. The displacement of fluorescent probes, selective for the two major drug binding sites of HSA, indicates that LC-PCB sulfates generally bind to HSA with such affinity that is equal to or greater than that for the LC-PCBs or OH-LC-PCBs This work also included a study of the selective toxicity of these compounds to dopaminergic neuronal cells. The selective toxicity of these compounds was studied in a series of immortalized cell lines (i. e., two neuronal cell lines: the rat midbrain-derived N 27 cell line, the human neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY 5 Y cell line, and the human liver-derived HepG 2 cell line). The assessment of toxicity by MTT reduction and LDH release in these cellular models indicated that hydroxylated and sulfated metabolites of LC-PCBs exhibited toxicity that was selective to neuronal cells and, in most cases, selective for the dopaminergic neuronal cells. Furthermore, HPLC analysis of the distribution of the compounds from the extracellular medium into the cellular milieu indicated that the observed toxicity may be due in some cases to selective transport and further metabolism. This work contributes to understanding the neurotoxicity of LC-PCB hydroxylated and sulfated metabolites and the role that binding to serum proteins may play in it. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for future studies on the effects that metabolism, particularly sulfation, may play in the disposition of LC-PCB congeners as it pertains to their metabolism, retention, and toxic effects...|$|R
40|$|Preterm {{birth is}} a major public health concern {{impacting}} one in eight babies born in the U. S. A. Although a precise cause for preterm birth cannot be established in most cases, {{one of the most}} promising predictors of preterm birth is inflammation of the extra-placental gestational membranes. Gestational membrane production of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been shown to initiate term parturition pathways and is thought to play a role in preterm parturition as well. Pregnant woman are exposed to a wide array of environmental pollutants, but few have been investigated epidemiologically for association with preterm birth and none have been satisfactorily investigated mechanistically. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are emerging toxicants of concern that have received limited attention regarding potential risks to human health and birth outcomes. Preliminary research suggests that PBDEs may stimulate the gestational membranes to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. This dissertation tests the hypothesis that polybrominated diphenyl ethers bioaccumulate in the human gestational compartment and stimulate cytokine secretion from human gestational membranes. Total PBDE levels were measured in the human gestational membranes and found at levels of 17. 4 ± 3. 9 pg/g tissue (5. 6 ± 1. 3 ng/g lipid). Human amniotic fluid levels were 3795 ± 1592 pg/ml fluid (404 ± 126 ng/g lipid). Congener-specific profiles for the 21 congeners measured identified only tri- through hexa-BDEs in gestational membranes. In contrast, tri- through deca-BDE congeners were found in amniotic fluid. To assess stimulation of inflammatory responses in human gestational membranes, two tissue culture systems were compared for cytokine release into the culture medium: a biopsy punch explant culture system and a transwell mounted explant culture system. Although lipopolysacharide stimulated a robust increase of interleukins- 1 β, 6, 8, 10 and tumor necrosis factor-α in both systems, with an amplified release of interleukins- 6, 8 and 10 in the punch culture system, no increase in cytokine release was observed in response to PBDE stimulation. This is the first report of PBDE accumulation in the human gestational membranes, providing a basis for future investigations of toxic action in this tissue and the first to suggest amniotic fluid as a <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> PBDE <b>exposure</b> for both the gestational membranes and the developing fetus...|$|R
40|$|The Indexed Dermal Bibliography (1995 - 2007) is a {{tool that}} directs workers, employers, {{industrial}} hygienists, researchers, and policy makers to information resources on occupational skin exposures to chemicals, including health effects surveillance, exposure characterization, hazard identification, risk assessment, and risk control and management. 1. 1 Background: More than 13 million workers in the United States are potentially exposed to chemicals at work via the skin. A worker's skin may be exposed to harmful chemicals through direct contact with contaminated surfaces, deposition of aerosols, and immersion in or splashes from liquids. Some chemicals cause contact dermatitis via direct skin contact. Contact dermatitis {{is one of the}} more frequently reported occupational illnesses, accounting for 10 %. 15 % of all occupational diseases, at an estimated annual cost in the United States (U. S.) of at least $ 1 billion. Many chemicals readily pass through the skin (called dermal penetration). Some of these chemicals are then taken up into the blood stream or by skin or immune cells (this is called dermal absorption). Dermal absorption can cause systemic health effects or can contribute to the effects of chemicals absorbed in the lungs by inhalation. Chemicals are often absorbed through the skin without being noticed by the worker. In some cases, the skin is a more <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> than the respiratory tract. This is particularly true for nonvolatile chemicals that are relatively toxic and that remain on work surfaces for long periods of time. 1. 2 Purpose of the Dermal Resource Guide: The Indexed Dermal Bibliography is designed to serve as a resource for information on dermal exposure for those who work in (1) at-risk occupations, (2) positions to investigate or control worker skin exposure to harmful chemicals, and (3) research settings or positions to set policy on dermal exposures. The Indexed Dermal Bibliography provides lists and descriptions of resources by topic for people looking for specific information on dermal exposure anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control. The Indexed Dermal Bibliography is not designed to be an exhaustive listing of materials from the dermal exposure literature, but rather a representative list <b>of</b> available dermal <b>exposure</b> resources. The Indexed Dermal Bibliography contains review articles and summaries of educational information. Individual research studies are not included here. In addition, the accuracy of information presented in the references has not been evaluated. 1. 3 Intended Uses and Audiences: The Indexed Dermal Bibliography is designed to provide descriptions of resources available for two different audiences: the general audience and the professional audience. Resources for the general audience are for those who have limited technical background or formal training in identifying and controlling harmful skin exposures. The general audience may include workers, small business employers, supervisors, worksite owners, insurers, and manufacturers of industrial chemicals. Resources for the professional audience are for those who typically use technical information for evaluating, recognizing, and controlling harmful skin exposures. The professional audience may include industrial hygienists, occupational epidemiologists, dermatologists, occupational physicians and nurses, academic researchers, toxicologists, and policy makers. In some cases resources for these two audiences are not mutually exclusive. General audience members are encouraged to look at the professional resources when they are interested in more detailed or technical information. Conversely, professionals looking for background information for training, education, or communication purposes may find relevant information in the resources for the general audience. 1. 4 Topics: The Indexed Dermal Bibliography lists resources that address a number of broad topics. The topics differ somewhat between general and professional audiences, but typically address the following: 1. Overview <b>of</b> dermal <b>exposure.</b> 2.

" [...] p. vii"Workers from almost every industrial sector and trade routinely experience dermal exposures to chemicals via contact with contaminated surfaces, deposition of aerosols and vapors, and immersion in or splashes from liquids. Such exposures may result in adverse health consequences ranging from direct effects to the skin (e. g., irritant contact dermatitis and corrosion) to systemic effects (e. g., cancers and neurological effects) and to sensitization (e. g., allergic contact dermatitis). Occupational skin diseases have previously been identified as one of the leading causes of occupational illness within the United States workforce with many of the reported skin disorders being associated with chemical exposures. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is dedicated to controlling and preventing workplace hazards including dermal exposures to chemicals. This document, Indexed Dermal Bibliography (1995 - 2007), is intended to serve as a resource guide for information on dermal issues within the workplace. The Indexed Dermal Bibliography has been structured to accommodate varying levels of technical background or formal training in identifying and controlling harmful skin exposures. The primary topics covered within the Indexed Dermal Bibliography include: (1) an overview <b>of</b> dermal <b>exposures,</b> (2) hazard identification, (3) exposure characterization, (4) health effects surveillance, (5) risk assessment, and (6) risk control management. This resource guide is not designed to be an exhaustive compilation of materials from the dermal exposure literature, but rather a representative list <b>of</b> available dermal <b>exposure</b> resources. The Indexed Dermal Bibliography contains, for the most part, review articles and an overview of educational information.

40|$|Nanotechnology, the {{manipulation}} of matter at a nanometer scale to produce new materials, structures, and devices having new properties, may revolutionize life in the future. It {{has the potential to}} impact medicine through improved disease diagnosis and treatment technologies and to impact manufacturing by creating smaller, lighter, stronger, and more efficient products. Nanotechnology could potentially decrease the impact of pollution by improving methods for water purification or energy conservation. Although engineered nanomaterials present seemingly limitless possibilities, they bring with them new challenges for identifying and controlling potential safety and health risks to workers. Of particular concern is the growing body of evidence that occupational exposure to some engineered nanomaterials can cause adverse health effects. As with any new technology or new material, the earliest exposures will likely occur for those workers conducting discovery research in laboratories or developing production processes in pilot plants. The research community is at the front line of creating new nanomaterials, testing their usefulness in a variety of applications and determining their toxicological and environmental impacts. Researchers handling engineered nanomaterials in laboratories should perform that work in a manner that protects their safety and health. This guidance document provides the best information currently available on engineering controls and safe work practices to be followed when working with engineered nanomaterials in research laboratories. Risk Management: Risk management {{is an integral part of}} occupational health and safety. Potential exposures to nanomaterials can be controlled in research laboratories through a flexible and adaptive risk management program. An effective program provides the framework to anticipate the emergence of this technology into laboratory settings, recognize the potential hazards, evaluate the exposure to the nanomaterial, develop controls to prevent or minimize exposure, and confirm the effectiveness of those controls. Hazard Identification: Experimental animal studies indicate that potentially adverse health effects may result from exposure to nanomaterials. Experimental studies in rodents and cell cultures have shown that the toxicity of ultrafine particles or nanoparticles is greater than the toxicity of the same mass of larger particles of similar chemical composition. Research demonstrates that inhalation is a <b>significant</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> for nanomaterials. Evidence from animal studies indicates that inhaled nanoparticles may deposit deep in lung tissue, possibly interfering with lung function. It is also theorized that nanoparticles may enter the bloodstream through the lungs and transfer to other organs. Dermal exposure and subsequent penetration of nanomaterials may cause local or systemic effects. Ingestion is a third potential <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> Little is known about the possible adverse effects of ingestion of nanomaterials, although some evidence suggests that nanosized particles can be transferred across the intestinal wall. Exposure Assessment: Exposure assessment is a key element of an effective risk management program. The exposure assessment should identify tasks that contribute to nanomaterial exposure and the workers conducting those tasks. An inventory of tasks should be developed that includes information on the duration and frequency of tasks that may result in exposure, along with the quantity of the material being handled, dustiness of the nanomaterial, and its physical form. A thorough understanding <b>of</b> the <b>exposure</b> potential will guide exposure assessment measurements, which will help determine the type of controls required for exposure mitigation. Exposure Control: Exposure control is the use of a set of tools or strategies for decreasing or eliminating worker exposure to a particular agent. <b>Exposure</b> control consists <b>of</b> a standardized hierarchy to include (in priority order) : elimination, substitution, isolation, engineering controls, administrative controls, or if no other option is available, personal protective equipment (PPE). Substitution or elimination is not often feasible for workers performing research with nanomaterials; however, it may be possible to change some aspects of the physical form of the nanomaterial or the process in a way that reduces nanomaterial release. Isolation includes the physical separation and containment of a process or piece of equipment, either by placing it in an area separate from the worker or by putting it within an enclosure that contains any nanomaterials that might be released. Engineering controls include any physical change to the process that reduces emissions or exposure to the material being contained or controlled. Ventilation is a form of engi-neering control that can be used to reduce occupational exposures to airborne particulates. General exhaust ventilation (GEV), also known as dilution ventilation, permits the release of the contaminant into the workplace air and then dilutes the concentration to an acceptable level. GEV alone is not an appropriate control for engineered nanomaterials or any other uncharacterized new chemical entity. Local exhaust ventilation (LEV), such as the standard laboratory chemical hood (formerly known as a laboratory fume hood), captures emissions at the source and thereby removes contaminants from the immediate occupational environment. Using selected forms of LEV properly is appropriate for control of engineered nanomaterials. Administrative controls can limit workers' exposures through techniques such as using job-rotation schedules that reduce the time an individual is exposed to a substance. Administrative controls may consist of standard operating procedures, general or specialized housekeeping procedures, spill prevention and control, and proper labeling and storage of nanomaterials. Employee training on the appropriate use and handling of nanomaterials is also an important administrative function. PPE creates a barrier between the worker and nanomaterials in order to reduce exposures. PPE may include laboratory coats, impervious clothing, closed-toe shoes, long pants, safety glasses, face shields, impervious gloves, and respirators. Other Considerations: Control verification or confirmation is essential to ensure that the implemented tools or strategies are performing as specified. Control verification can be performed with traditional industrial hygiene sampling methods, including area sampling, personal sampling, and real-time measurements. Control verification may also be achieved by monitoring the performance parameters of the control device to ensure that design and performance criteria are met. Other important considerations for effective risk management of nanomaterial expo-sure include fire and explosion control. Some studies indicate that nanomaterials may be more prone to explosion and combustion than an equivalent mass concentration of larger particles. Occupational health surveillance is used to identify possible injuries and illnesses and is recommended as a key element in an effective risk management program. Basic medical screening is prudent and should be conducted under the oversight of a qualified health-care professional. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "May 2012.
