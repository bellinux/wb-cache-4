5|$|The AC {{electric}} motor {{used in a}} VFD system is usually three-phase induction motor. Some types of <b>single-phase</b> motors or synchronous motors advantageous in some situations can be used, but three-phase induction motors are generally preferred as the most economical motor choice. Motors that are designed for fixed-speed operation are often used. Elevated-voltage stresses imposed on induction motors that are supplied by VFDs require that such motors be designed for definite-purpose inverter-fed duty in accordance with such requirements as Part 31 of NEMA Standard MG-1.|$|E
5|$|The main {{electrical}} {{system on the}} B.1/B.1A was 112V DC supplied by four 22.5kW engine-driven starter-generators. Backup power was provided by four 24V 40Ah batteries connected in series providing 96V. Secondary {{electrical system}}s were 28V DC, <b>single-phase</b> 115V AC at 1600Hz, and three-phase 115V AC at 400Hz, driven by transformers and inverters from the main system.

5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having <b>single-phase</b> converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E

Dynamic {{model of the}} induction motor in the stationary reference frame was adopted and modified to reflect <b>single-phasing</b> fault. A simulation algorithm was proposed, which can help determine the impact of <b>single-phasing</b> on any three phase induction motor. A case study simulation was carried-out with sudden <b>single-phasing</b> using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. A <b>single-phasing</b> protection by means of contactors was reviewed before an enhanced <b>single-phasing</b> protection was designed. A prototype of the enhanced protection method was implemented {{by the use of}} ac to dc converter, PIC 16 F 877 A and DC relays.

5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by <b>single-phase</b> equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{rare earth}} (RE) ion doped <b>single-phased</b> phosphors, which can emit tunable colors upon single {{wavelength}} excitation, {{have received a}} great deal of attention, but most of them involve multiple dopants as luminescence centers. This work reports on <b>single-phased</b> LuVO 4 :Eu 3 + phosphors with tunable emission colors upon a single wavelength excitation while using Eu 3 + as a single dopant ion. The tunable emission is realized through precisely manipulating the energy transfer efficiency from VO 4 3 - to Eu 3 + by controlling the Eu 3 + doping content, which allows modulating the photoemission intensity ratio between VO 4 3 - and Eu 3 + upon excitation at 265 nm and therefore color tuning from blue (0. 2204, 0. 2194) to red (0. 6703, 0. 2986). Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements reveal that the energy transfer process occurs 4 μs after the excitation and becomes dominant 10 μs later with the disappearance of the VO 4 3 - emission. The temperature-dependent PL spectra show that the energy transfer can be accelerated as the temperature increases, and it leads to abnormal enhancement of the Eu 3 + emission at the earlier state. A similar scenario is not observed upon exciting the phosphors at the intrinsic absorption of Eu 3 +, which implies that the reversible energy transfer from Eu 3 + to VO 4 3 - is impossible. Our results demonstrate a feasible strategy for tuning the emission color of <b>single-phased</b> phosphors through controlling the energy transfer process from the host to the dopant, and it opens up new possibilities for designing tunable luminescent materials for future optoelectronics applications.

25|$|In {{half-wave}} rectification of a <b>single-phase</b> supply, also called uncontrolled one-pulse midpoint circuit, either the {{positive or negative}} half of the AC wave is passed, while the other half is blocked. Mathematically, it is a ramp function (for positive pass, negative block): passing positive corresponds to the ramp function being the identity on positive inputs, blocking negative corresponds to being zero on negative inputs. Because only one half of the input waveform reaches the output, mean voltage is lower. Half-wave rectification requires a single diode in a <b>single-phase</b> supply, or three in a three-phase supply. Rectifiers yield a unidirectional but pulsating direct current; half-wave rectifiers produce far more ripple than full-wave rectifiers, and much more filtering is needed to eliminate harmonics of the AC frequency from the output.|$|E
