40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 University of Washington Abstract Repeat {{abortion}} {{and use of}} contraceptive among post-abortion women in Nepal – A prospective cohort study Aradhana Thapa Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Research Professor, Annette L. Fitzpatrick Department of Family Medicine and Epidemiology Adjunct, Department of Global Health Aim: The study aims to identify the associated risk factors of repeat abortions and post-abortion contraceptive use among women in Pokhara city of Nepal. Background: Nepal legalized abortion in 2002 to promote <b>safer</b> <b>motherhood</b> (7). <b>Safe</b> abortion was attributed {{to be one of}} the contributing factors to a sharp decline of maternal mortality and morbidity in the country (9), however, abortion should not be considered an alternative to contraceptive use. Choosing abortions, repeatedly, can be detrimental to women and child health (11, 12). Post-abortion acceptance of contraception is low (41 %) in the country and repeat abortion, high (33 %) (8, 11). Method: This is a prospective cohort study conducted among women who had just received an abortion procedure between January 2015 to April 2015 at three abortion clinics of Pokhara city in Nepal. We recruited 220 women immediately after their abortions to conduct a baseline interview and followed these in-person interviews with a telephone interview two months later to collect information on each woman’s current contraceptive method. Findings: The present study revealed that only half of the post-abortion women use effective contraception after {{abortion and}} there is a high prevalence of repeat abortion. The main factors positively influencing use of post-abortion contraception were presence of the woman’s husband in another country and choice of Tier II contraceptive methods. The main risk factors identified for repeat abortion were age and age at first pregnancy. Better educated women were less likely to adopt effective contraceptive measure after abortion. Conclusion: Considering low contraception use after abortion, increasing numbers of abortion, and high incidence of repeat abortion, a well targeted intervention may have substantial effect to reduce risk of unintended pregnancies...|$|R

As the critical discourse is shifting towards the realm of popular culture, we must begin to locate several discourses {{at work in the}} drama of quite possibly the most popular, visible, and financially successful African American playwright of the twenty-first century, if not of all time. Drawing on gender and queer theory, I offer a theoretical discussion about subversive and non-subversive drag acts, and I question the degree to which Perry appropriates drag in a politically liberating or constraining manner. Moreover, I examine the gender and sexual politics in Madea’s Family Reunion to illustrate the ways in which I read Perry as offering a very conflicted dialectic between activist aspirations and oppressive tendencies, particularly in regard to questions of <b>safe</b> feminist spaces, <b>motherhood,</b> female self-sufficiency, female self-definition, domestic violence, and homosexuality...|$|R
40|$|Objective: A time {{motion study}} {{to check the}} {{efficiency}} of the workload, the facilities, and the providers and the reasons for identified delays in women with obstetric emergencies with the aim of making <b>motherhood</b> <b>safer</b> for developing countries. Materials and Methods: A client flow chart was used to collect time records of arrival of respondents at labour ward and the time of the various activities were noted. Structured questionnaires were also used. Data analysis was done using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) Software. Using EPI-INFO Statcalc Feature, further analysis was employed using Yates Correction of Continuity χ 2 to measure association between demographic characteristics and feto-maternal outcome. Results: Ninety-six women with obstetric emergencies at the labour wards of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex were studied. Delays in delivery care occurred mostly in subjects requiring emergency caesarean section. There were theatre related and care givers related factors. The major cause of delays was inadequate operating theatre space and/or inconsistent labour ward theatre power supply. Delays between decision and commencement of caesarean section had a significant relationship with perinatal and maternal mortality (p-value= 0. 001). Demographic characteristics of the women did not have any significance impact with maternal outcome but low level of education and religious persuasions impacted negatively on perinatal outcome (p< 0. 05). Discussion: Phase 3 delays occurred in this hospital with a resultant increase in maternal and perinatal mortality i...|$|R

40|$|Ensuring <b>safe</b> {{pregnancy}} and <b>motherhood</b> occupies {{a pivotal role}} and has been considered {{as one of the}} key issues in the framework of reproductive and child health programmes, Evidence from research studies indicate that there is a growing tendency for caesarean section deliveries especially during complications confronted at the time of {{pregnancy and}} delivery. The present study focuses on the demographic, antenatal can, spatial and socio-economic variables associated with caesarean section delivery in Kerala, India. The data from the National Family Health Survey has been utilised for this purpose. The results from logistic regression models indicate that maternal age, birth order, current age, births in health institutions and spatial differences were significantly associated with caesarean section deliveries in Kerala, The older cohorts of mothers were found at higher risk to have caesarean section when compared to their younger counterparts. When controlled for demographic variables, the odds for caesarean section was about 1. 7 times more likely to occur in private health institutions. The inclusion of spatial and socio-economic variables has neither influenced the demographic and antenatal care variables nor showed any significant association with caesarean section delivery in the state. The present study calls for that a detailed investigation on behavioural aspects of both the physician and the patient with regard to type of delivery in the state. Information related to pregnancy and health related aspects needs to be monitored more accurately, both in the public and private hospitals, to understand the determinants associated with caesarean section.

40|$|Introduction: Ensuring {{access to}} {{universal}} {{primary health care}} is essential to secure a <b>safe</b> and pleasant <b>motherhood</b> and to provide compassionate care for mothers and newborns. However, inequalities in the access to maternal health services still remain a prominent problem in many countries. As part of reducing inequalities, Ethiopia launched the Health Extension Program (HEP) in 2003. The HEP is a community based program designed with a defined package of essential promotive, preventive and basic curative services targeting households, particularly mothers and children. Despite the construction of over 600 health posts and deploying more than 1200 Health Extension Workers (HEWs), preliminary data suggests a low utilization of maternal health care services. This thesis explores the HEP contribution in improving women’s access to maternal health care, {{and the reasons for}} the low use of maternal health care services from the perspectives of the involved actors in the Tigray region in Ethiopia. The five dimensions of access were used as a framework to explore the access to maternal health care utilization in this setting. Methods: A total of four districts were included in the study. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were applied. In the first sub-study, we assessed the HEP and its association with change in the utilization of antenatal, delivery and postnatal care services. Retrospective longitudinal data for 10 years was extracted from three selected districts and checked for accuracy. Segmented linear regression technique was used to control the secular trends adjusted for correlation of the data. For the second sub-study, we conducted a cross sectional survey with 1115 women (aged 15 - 49 years who had given birth within five years prior to the survey period) to determine the prevalence of antenatal care and institutional delivery utilization and explore their determinant factors of low utilization. For the third sub-study, we conducted six focus group discussions (FGDs) with a total of 51 women to explore women’s experiences of childbirth and maternal care. An interview with eight HEWs and four midwives were carried out to capture health workers’ perspective on access to maternal health care services in the fourth sub-study. Grounded theory for the former, and thematic analysis for the latter were used for the analysis. Main findings: The finding of the first sub-study showed a statistically significant upward trend for delivery care (DC) and postnatal care (PNC) in all facilities during the HEP late implementation period (July 2008 -June 2012). In addition, a substantial trend of antenatal care (ANC) service use was observed at health centres after the intervention. In the second sub-study, the determinant predictors for ANC utilization were: proximity to health facilities, to be married, ≥ 5 years of education and having non-farming husbands. The last three factors were also significantly associated with institutional delivery, but also lower parity, previous history of obstructed/prolonged labour and ANC counselling. Findings from the qualitative studies pointed out that elderly women influenced women’s decision making about where to give birth. Women were mostly positive about giving birth at health facilities, but were concerned about the poor quality of care, inaccessibility and unavailability of transport. From the health workers’ perspective: specialized performance of hospital services, community assistance during referral and an increased awareness among women regarding the benefits of giving birth at a health facility were perceived as facilitators for institutional deliveries. Poor perceived competence of HEWs, poor conditions of health care facilities and inaccessibility of transportation, among others, were perceived as barriers for giving birth at health facilities. Conclusion: Overall, this research revealed a considerable contribution of the HEP in improving the access and coverage of maternal health services (ANC, DC and PNC). However, cultural traditions, scattered localities, mountainous roads without adequate transportation and low quality of care are still the major obstacles to accessing the services. Mechanisms need to be designed to enable health facility access of safe delivery for women in hard to reach areas, improving the proficiency of health workers and introducing a women centered approach that enhances acceptability of the services. ሽፋን መሰረታዊ ክንክን ጥዕና ምዕባይ ድሕንነት ኣዴታትን ህፃናትን ንኽረጋገፅ ዝለዓለ ተራ ከምዘለዎ ይፍለጥ፡፡ ይኹንደኣምበር ግልጋሎት ጥዕና ኣዴታት ብማዕረ ኣብ ምብፃሕን ብምዕሩይ ኣገባብ ኣብ ምሃብን ብዙሓት ሃገራት እናተፀገማ እየን፡፡ ነዚ ዘይምዕሩይን ማዕረ ዘይኾነን ኣዋህባ ግልጋሎት ጥዕና ንምምሕያሽ ኣብ ሃገርና (ኢትዮጵያ) ብ 1994 - 1995 (ብአቆፃፅራ ግእዝ) ዝተኣታተወ ፕሮግራም ምግፋሕ ጥሙር ጥዕና ቤተሰብ (Health Extension Program/HEP) 10 ዓመታት ኣሕሊፉ ይርከብ፡፡ ፕሮግራም ምግፋሕ ጥሙር ጥዕና (HEP) ፣ ሕብረተሰብ መሰረት ዝገበረ-ምክልኻል ሕማማትን ምስጓም ጥዕናን - ምትእትታው ግልጋሎት ሕክምና ቀለልቲ ሕማማትን ብፍላይ ድማ ንኣዴታትን ህፃናትን ትኹረት ብምግባር ስድራ ቤት ብምሕቋፍ ዝንቀሳቐስ ፕሮግራም እዩ፡፡ እዚ ፕሮግራም ንምትግባር ኣብ ክልል ትግራይ ልዕሊ 600 ኬላታት ጥዕና ተሃኒፀን፡፡ ልዕሊ 1200 ሞያተኛታት ጥሙር ጥዕና እውን ሰልጢነን እየን፡፡ ክልተ ሞያተኛታት ኣብ ሓደ ኬላ ጥዕና ተመዲበን ካብ 5000 - 7000 በዝሒ ንዘለዎ ሕብረተሰብ ግልጋሎት እናሃባ ይርከባ፡፡ እንተኾነ ግን ዝተፈላለዩ መፅናዕታታት ከምዘመላኽትዎ ግልጋሎት ኣዴታት ጥዕና (ወሊድን ድሕሪ ወሊድን) ትሑት ሽፋን ከምዘለዎ ይሕበር፡፡ ዕላማ እዚ ዝገበርናዮ መፅናዕቲ እውን ኩነታት እቲ ግልጋሎት ብኣሃዝ ንምዕቃንን ከምኡ እውን ምኽንያታት እቲ ትሑት ግልጋሎት ንምድህሳስን እዩ፡፡ ኣብዚ መፅናዕቲ እዚ ምኽንያታት ትሑት ሽፋን ግልጋሎት ክንክን ጥንሲ ወሊድን ድሕረ ወሊድን እንታይ ምዃኑ ካብ ሕሉፍ ልምዲ (ተሞክሮ) ኣዴታትን ሰብ ሞያ ጥዕናን ብዝርዝር ብምድህሳስ - ፕሮግራም ምግፋሕ ጥሙር ጥዕና ንቐረብ ግልጋሎት ኣዴታት ጥዕና ንምምሕያሽ ዘለዎ ኣስተዋፅኦ እንታይ ከምዝመስል ተተንቲኑ ቐሪቡ ኣሎ፡፡ እቲ ቀረብ ግልጋሎት ጥዕና ሓሙሽተ መዐቀኒታት ብዘለዎ ፍሬም ዎርክ እዩ ተዳህሲሱ እቶም ሓሙሽተ መመዘኒታት 1. ቅርበት ትካል ጥዕናን ሰብ ሞያ ጥዕናን ንተገልገልቲ 2. ህልውነት ሰብ ሞያ ጥዕናን ናውትን ድሌት ተገልገልትን 3. ሰብ ሞያ ጥዕና ብተገልገልቲ ዘለዎም ተቐባልነት 4. ትካል ጥዕና ንድሌት ተገልገልቲ ንምዕጋብ ዘለዎ ድልውነት 5. ተገልገልቲ ወፃኢታት ሕክምና ንምሽፋን/ንምኽፋል ዘለዎም ድሌትን ዓቕምን እዮም፡፡ እዞም ሓሙሽተ መዐቀኒታት መሰረት ዝገበሩ ኣርባዕተ ዓይነታዊን አሃዛዊን ሜላታት ብምጥቃም ዝተኻየዱ መፅናዕትታት ኣብ ኣብ 4 ተ ወረዳታት ትግራይ እዮም ተኻይዶም፡፡ ኣብቲ ቀዳማይ መፅናዕቲ ፕሮግራም ምግፋሕ ጥሙር ጥዕና ቤተሰብ (HEP) ኣብ ምምሕያሽ ክንክን ጥንሲ-ወሊድን-ድሕረ ወሊድን ግልጋሎት ዘምፅኦ ለውጢ ኣብ ሰለስተ ወረዳታት (ጋንታአፈሹም፤ ክልተ ኣውላዕሎ፣ ሕንጣሎ ዋጅራት) ንዝሓለፉ 10 ዓመታት ኣብ ዝተዋህበ ግልጋሎት ብምድራኽ እዩ ዳህሰሳ ተኻይዱ፡፡ ትኽክለኛነት እቲ ፀብፃብ እውን ካብ ትካላት ጥዕና ዝተልኣኸ ወርሓዊ ኣብ ወረዳ ምስ ዘሎ ፀብፃብ ብምንፅፃር ንኽረጋግፅ ተገይሩ እዩ፡፡ እቲ ካልኣይ መፅናዕቲ ኣብ ወረዳ ሰሓርቲ ሳምረ ካብ 19 ጣብያታት ካብ ዝተመረፃ 30 ቑሸታት ዕድሚአን ካብ 15 - 49 ዓመት ምስ ዝኾና 1115 ደቂኣንስትዮ ኣስታት 30 ደቓይቕ ዝወደአ ቃለ መሕትት ብምኽያድ እዩ ዳህሰሳ ተኻይዱ፡፡ ኣብ ወሊድ ግልጋሎት ዘሎ ልምድን ተሞክሮን ንምድህሳስ 51 ኣዴታት ዝተሳተፋሉ ሽዱሽተ ጉጅላዊ ምይይጥ በቲ ሳልሳይ መፅናዕቲ ምርምር ዝተፈፀመ እንትኾን ምስ ሸሞንተ ሞያተኛታት ጥሙር ጥዕናን ኣርባዕተ ነርስ መዋልዳንን ቃለ መሕትት ብምኽያድ እቲ 4 ይ ምርምር/መፅናዕቲ ተፈፂሙ እዩ፡፡ ውፅኢት ቀዳማይ መፅናዕታዊ ፅሑፍ ኣብዚ ቐዳማይ መፅናዕቲ እቶም ዝተአከቡ መረዳእታት ኣብ ሰለስተ ደረጃታት - ቅድመ ፕሮግራም-ፕሮግራም-ድሕረ ፕሮግራም ብዝብል ዝተመቐሉ እዮም፡፡ እቲ ቐንዲ ዕላማ ፕሮግራም ምግፋሕ ጥሙር ጥዕና ድሕሪ ምጅማር ዝተራእየ ለውጢ ንምፍታሽ እዩ፡፡ ኣብ ድሕሪ እቲ ፕሮግራም ካብ 2001 - 2004 ዓ/ም ብዝተኻየዱ ንጥፈታት ጥዕና ግልጋሎት ወሊድን ድሕረ ወሊድን ኣብ ኩለን ትካላት ጥዕና ካብ ዓመት ናብ ዓመት ልዑል ኣዝማሚያ እናርኣየ ከምዝኸደ ብስታቲስቲካዊ መረዳእታ ንምርግጋፅ ተኻኢሉ እዩ፡፡ ብተመሳሳሊ ኣብዚ ወቕቲ እዚ ኣዝማሚያ ግልጋሎት ክንክን ጥንሲ ኣብ ጥዕና ጣቢያታት ጥራሕ እናለዓለ ከምዝኸደ ውፅኢት እቲ መፅናዕቲ የረድእ፡፡ እቲ መፅናዕቲ ከም ዘረድኦ ሽፋን ክንክን ጥንሲ ብ 1995 ካብ ዝነበሮ 28. 2 % ብ 2004 ናብ 46. 7 ክምዝለዓለ፤ ግልጋሎት ወሊድ ብ 1995 ካብ ዝነበሮ 5 % ዝነበረ ናብ 23 % ከምዝደየበ ድሕረ ወሊድ ግልጋሎት እውን 11 % ዝነበረ ናብ 41 % ከምዝለዓለ ንምርዳእ ተኻኢሉ ኣሎ፡፡ ውፅኢት ካልኣይ መፅናዕታዊ ፅሑፍ ኣዴታት ግልጋሎት ክንክን ጥንሲ ኣብ ጥዕና ጣቢያ ንኽጥቀማ ቅርበት ትካላት ጥዕና ንመንበሪ ገዛውቲ፣ ሓዳር ምግባር፣ ልዕሊ 5 ዓመት ስሩዕ ትምህርቲ ምምሃርን ካብ ሕርሻ ወፃኢ ኣብ ካልእ ስራሕቲ ዝተዋፈሩ ሰብ ሓዳር ምህላው ወሰንቲ ኣካላት ምዃኖም በቲ ዝተገብረ ካልኣይ መፅናዕቲ ተረጋጊፁ፡፡ ብተመሳሳሊ ኣብ እዋን ክንክን ጥንሲ ንኣዴታት ምኽሪ ግልጋሎት ምሃብ ቅድመ ታሪኽ ዝንጉዕ ሕርሲ ወይ ሃልኪ ምንባር እውን ኣብ ትካላት ጥዕና ወሊድ ግልጋሎት ንኽመሓየሽ ወሰንቲ ኩነታት ከምዝኾኑ በቲ መፅናዕቲ ተረጋጊፁ፡፡ ብሓፈሻ ፕሮግራም ምግፋሕ ጥሙር ጥዕና ቤተሰብ (HEP) ቀረብ ግልጋሎት ጥዕናን ሽፋን ክንክን ጥንሲ ወሊድን ድሕረ ወሊድ ግልጋሎትን ኣብ ምምሕያሽ ዝተፃወቶ ተራ ትርጉም ዘለዎ ምዃኑ በቲ ዝገበርናዮ መፅናዕቲ ንምርዳእ ተኻኢሉ ኣሎ፡፡ እንተኾነ ግን ባህላዊን ልማዳዊን ኩነታት (ኣብ ገዛ ክትወልድ ምድላይ- ነፍሰፁር ዓይኒሰብ ከይረኽባ ኢልካ ምእማን) - ተበቲኖም ዝሰፈሩ ነበርቲ ምህላው - ኣፀገምቲን ዓቐብ ቁልቁልን ጎቦታትን ዝበዝሖም መንገድታትን እኹል መጉዓዝያ ዘይምህላውን ቀንዲ ሃልኪታትን ዕንቅፋታትን እቲ ዝወሃብ ግልጋሎት ምዃኖም ኣብዚ መፅናዕቲ ተገሊፁ እዩ፡፡ ብተወሳኺ ኣብ ላዕለዎት ትካላት ጥዕና ዘይብሩህ ገፅን ሰሓባይ ኣቀራርባ ሰብ ሞያ ጥዕና ዘይምህላውን ተቐባልነት ዘይብሎም ባህሪያት ምንፅብራቕን ነቲ ግልጋሎት ዝዓዘዘ ዕንቅፋት ከምዘለዎ በቲ መፅናዕቲ ንምርዳእ ተኻኢሉ እዩ፡፡ ማይን መብራህትን ዝኣመሰሉ ትሕቲ ቕርፂ ኣብ ኬላታት ጥዕና ዘይምህላዉ ኣዴታት ኣብ ቀረበአን ዘሎ ትካል ጥዕና ንኽወልዳ ዘየተባብዕ ከምዝኾነ እውን ተሓቢሩ እዩ፡፡ ውፅኢት ሳልሳይን ራብዓይን መፅናዕታዊ ፅሑፍ ኣብ ሳልሳይ መፅናዕቲ ምስ ኣዴታት ብዝተገበረ ምይይጥ - ኣደ እትወልደሉ ቦታ ባዕላ ንኽትውስን ከምእነሓጎታት ዝመሰላ ዕድመ ዝደፍኣ ኣዴታትን ፀቕጢ (ተፅእኖ) ከምዝግበረላ እቶም መፅናዕቲታት ይሕብሩ፡፡ ዋላ አኳ ኣብ ትካል ጥዕና ብዛዕባ ምውላድ ኣዎንታዊ ኣረኣእያ ኣዴታት ዝዓዘዘ እንተኾነ ብዛዕባ ድኹም ኣዋህባ አገልግሎት ጥዕና ኣዝዩ ከምዘተሓሳስበን እቲ መፅናዕቲ ይገልፅ፡፡ ትካል ጥዕና ናብ መንበሪ ኣዴታት ዘለዎ ርሕቐትን መጓዓዓዚ ዘይምርካብ ዝኣመሰሉ ፀገማት ከምዘገድስወን እውን እቲ መፅናዕቲ ይሕብር፡፡ ኣብቲ ራብዓይ መፅናዕቲ ብወገን ሞያተኛታት ጥሙር ጥዕናን ነርስ መዋልዳንን ብዝተገበረ ምይይጥ - ኣብ ሆስፒታል ዝዋሃቡ ዝሐሹ ግልጋሎት ኣዴታት ካብ ታሕተዋይ ትካል ጥዕና ናብ ሆስፒታላት ሪፈር እንትበሃላ ኣብ ምጉዕዓዝ ብሕብረተሰብ ዝግበር ምትሕግጋዝ ከምኡ እውን እናዓበየ ዝኸይድ ዘሎ ግንዛበ ሕብረተሰብ ኣዴታት ኣብ ትካል ጥዕና ንኽወልዳ መሳለጢ ከምዝኾነ እቲ ፅንዓት የረድእ፡፡ ዓቕሚ ምንኣስ ሞያተኛታት ጥሙር ሞያተኛታት ጥሙር ጥዕናን ነርስ መዋልዳንን - ድኹም ኩነታት ትካል ጥዕናን (ሕፅረት ናውቲ ጥዕና ምህላዉ - ትሕቲ ቅርፂ ዘይምምላእ) ፀገም መጉዓዝያን እውን ኣዴታት ኣብ ትካል ጥዕና ንኸይወልዳ ዕንቅፋታት ከምዝኾነ እቲ ፅንዓት የመላኽት፡፡ መጠቓለሊ እቶም ዝተጠቐሱ ዕንቅፋታትን ፀገማትን ብምንካይ ቀረብ ወሊድ ግልጋሎት ጥዕና ንምዕባይ እዞም ዝስዕቡ ፃዕሪታት ምክያድ ይግባእ፡፡ ኣብ ጎቦታትን ኣዝዩ ርሑቕን ኣፀገምትን ዝሰፈረ ሕብረተሰብ ካብቲ ልሙድ ዝተፈለየ ቀረብ ግልጋሎት ጥዕና ምሃብ (ንኣብነት ካብ ጥዕና ጣቢያ ኣዝየን ዝርሕቓ ኬላታት ጥዕና ክእለት ዘለወን ነርስ መዋልዳን (midwives) ምምዳብ - ኣደ ማእኸል ዝገበረ ግልጋሎት ንኽወሃብ ሰብ ሞያ ጥዕና ብዓቕሚ ንኽዓብዩ ምግባርን ነቶም ሓሙሽተ መዐቀኒታት ቀረብ ግልጋሎት ብምምላእ ኣብቲ ሕብረተሰብ ተቐባልነት እቲ ግልጋሎት ክዓቢ ምግባርን፡...|$|R
