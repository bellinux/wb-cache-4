50|$|A DNA field-effect {{transistor}} (DNAFET) is a {{field-effect transistor}} which uses the field-effect {{due to the}} partial charges of DNA molecules {{to function as a}} biosensor. The structure of DNAFETs {{is similar to that of}} MOSFETs with the exception of the gate structure which, in DNAFETs, is replaced by a layer of immobilized ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) molecules which act as surface receptors. When complementary DNA strands hybridize to the receptors, the charge distribution near the surface changes, which in turn modulates current transport through the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>transducer.</b>|$|E

Their advantages compared to other technologies are direct, label-free, ultrasensitive, and (near) real-time operation. We have developed 2 D and 3 D multi-scale models for planar sensor structures and for nanowire sensors. The multi-scale models are indispensable due to the large difference in the characteristic length scales of the biosensors: the charge distribution in the biofunctionalized surface layer varies on the Angstrom length scale, the diameters of the nanowires are several nanometers, and the sensor lengths measure several micrometers. The multi-scale models for the electrostatic potential can be coupled to any charge transport model of the transducer. Conductance simulations of nanowire sensors with different diameters provide numerical evidence for the importance of the dipole moment of the biofunctionalized surface layer in addition to its surface charge.

40|$|The diminished {{cardiac output}} {{response}} to exercise with advancing age may {{be attributable to}} intrinsic inability of the old ventricle to respond appropriately and/or to an additional loading imposed upon the ventricle by the aged vascular system. The steady (resistance) and pulsatile (characteristic impedance) load components together comprise the vascular load faced by the ejecting ventricle. To study the effect of exercise on both vascular components of load, the aortic input impedance was measured in chronically instrumented young and old beagle dogs during graded treadmill exercise before and after beta blockade. Ascending aortic flow was measured by a cuff electromagnetic flow probe, and pressure was measured by a high-fidelity <b>semiconductor</b> <b>transducer.</b> At low levels of exercise the old animals demonstrated a striking 20 % increase in characteristic impedance and a 28 % decrease in peripheral resistance with no increase in stroke volume. This vascular loading and limitation in stroke volume persisted across the higher exercise levels. In contrast, the young group demonstrated no increase in characteristic impedence, a progressive decrease in peripheral resistance, and a progressive increase in stroke volume across the same exercise levels. These age differences in vascular response and ventricular output were abolished by beta blockade. The groups did not demonstrate a difference in heart rate response, but the young had a greater increase in external left ventricular power than the old across exercise. These data demonstrated a profound difference in the response of young and old vasculature to exercise. At low and intermediate exercise levels the pulsatile vascular load {{appeared to be a}} major factor in the limitation of stroke volume in old dogs. At high levels of exercise, the limited exercise response in the old dog may be caused in part by a diminished inotropic responsiveness as well as by the vascular loading...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Flow and {{pressure}} {{in a short}} diffuser placed at exit of a plane turbulent jet have been studied. With connecting two ports in the diffuser by a duct, jet direction oscillates laterally. Flow pattern in the diffuser is visualized by smoke and instantaneous velocities {{and pressure}}s are measured by using hot-wire anemometers and <b>semiconductor</b> pressure <b>transducers.</b> Phased-locked ensemble averages of velocity and pressure are deduced to examine the detailed nature of the oscillatory flow. These measurements reveal that the jet attaches alternatively on both walls of the diffuser with keeping two-dimensionality. The detaching speed is much slower than the attaching one. The jet oscillation accompanies the vibration of port pressures and duct flow. By examining the results with fluid dynamics, it is clarified that the jet is bent by port pressure difference via lateral momentum equation without unsteady effect and the duct flow is driven by port pressure difference via unsteady duct flow equation. A flow model to govern the port pressure change is proposed, that is, the pressure {{is determined by the}} balance between jet entrainments and air supply.

40|$|The high {{pressure}} turbine stage {{can be considered}} the most important component for the efficiency and longevity of a modern gas turbine. The flow field within this stage is highly complex and is both unsteady and three-dimensional. Understanding this flow field is essential if improvements are {{to be made to}} future engine designs. Increasingly designers are placing more emphasis on the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) rather than experimental results. CFD methods can be more flexible and cost effective. However before these predictions can be used they must be validated against experimental data at engine conditions.

Our proposal consists of exploiting a double first-order model of the MOX-based sensor from which a steady-state output is anticipated in real time given measurements of the transient state signal.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new lab-on-a-chip (LOC) which utilizes a biological <b>semiconductor</b> (BSC) <b>transducer</b> for label free analysis of Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB) (or other biological interactions) directly and electronically. BSCs are new transducers based on electrical percolation through a multi-layer carbon nanotube-antibody network. In BSCs {{the passage of}} current through the conductive network is dependent upon {{the continuity of the}} network. Molecular interactions within the network, such as binding of antigens to the antibodies, disrupt the network continuity causing increased resistance of the network. For the fabrication of a BSC based detector, we combined several elements: (1) BSC transducers for direct detection, (2) LOC for flow through continuous measurements, (3) a digital multimeter with computer connection for data logging, (4) pumps and valves for fluid delivery, and (5) a computer for fluid delivery control and data analysis. Polymer lamination technology was used for the fabrication of a four layer LOC for BSC detection, the BSC on the chip is fabricated by immobilizing pre-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) -antibody complex directly on the PMMA surface of the LOC. SEB samples were loaded into the device using a peristaltic pump and the change in resistance resulting from antibody-antigen interactions was continuously monitored and recorded. Binding of SEB rapidly increases the BSC electrical resistance. SEB in buffer was assayed with limit of detection (LOD) of 5 ng mL(- 1) at a signal to baseline (S/B) ratio of 2. A secondary antibody was used to verify the presence of the SEB captured {{on the surface of the}} BSC and for signal amplification.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{horizontal}} {{motion of the}} locust antenna was studied by behavioural and electrophysiological investigations. Deflection of the flagellum and the pedicel induced by air currents or a needle were used as mechanical stimuli. The forces at this needle during imposed movements were measured with a <b>semiconductor</b> force <b>transducer.</b> The antennal movements were recorded with a capacitative movement transducer, and myograms were recorded simultaneously from the lateral and median scape muscle. Each scape muscle is innervated by at least three excitatory motoneurones. Reflex movements of the scape-pedicel joint are triggered by several sense organs of the locust, e. g. antennal sensilla. Touching a flagellum of a resting locust normally evokes either an avoidance reflex, which removes the antenna from the stimulus source, or reflex chains, during which the antenna oscillates against the stimulus source. Air-current stimuli induce synchronous phasic-tonic responses in both scape muscles and a stereotyped movement of the antenna (flight-start reaction). This reaction occurs synchronously {{with the onset of}} flight muscle activity, and {{is the beginning of the}} antennal-positioning reaction that leads to the antennal flight posture. This posture is held constant during steady flight within a range of ± 1 °. Sudden deflections of the antenna of a flying locust by air-current modulations or by a solid object cause phasic-tonic responses similar to those during the start of flight. Force measurements indicate these responses to be resistance reflexes. Experiments in which one antennal joint was immobilized at a time show the following. (1) Stimulation of only the sensilla of the pedicel-flagellum joint triggers transient avoidance reflexes in resting locusts and sustained resistance reflexes in flying ones. (2) Stimulation of the sensilla of the scape-pedicel joint alone causes avoidance and resistance reflexes in resting locusts, and resistance reflexes in flying ones...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{dissipation}} factor (DF) {{is an important}} material property of piezoceramics that governs the amount of self-heating under resonant conditions; it essentially quantifies a particular material type for either an actuator or resonator application: high DF materials with typically higher output (d 33) are better for actuators, whereas low DF materials with typically lower d 33 are better for resonators. Transducer designers must often compromise between mechanical output and DF {{in the selection of}} piezoceramics for power ultrasonic applications, and abnormally high DF {{is one of the main}} causes of production stoppages. In theory DF is simply the current/voltage phase deviation from an ideal capacitor at 90 ° (a. k. a. tan(δ) or dielectric loss). Abnormally high DF is typically caused by moisture absorption due to poor ceramic porosity, which causes voltage leakage effects; e. g., seen in transducer production when setting piezo stack preload. Corresponding large increases in capacitance can also be associated with poor porosity, which is counterintuitive unless there is moisture absorption or electrode wicking. This research investigates the mechanisms for abnormally high DF in peizoceramics, and its corresponding effect on transducer performance. It investigates if DF is only affected by the bulk dielectric properties of the piezoceramics (e. g. porosity), or is also influenced by non-uniform electric field effects from electrode wicking. It explores if higher DF ceramics can affect transducer displacement/current gain stability via moisture expulsion at higher drive levels. The investigation focuses solely on the common PZT 8 piezoelectric material used with welding <b>transducers</b> for <b>semiconductor</b> wire bonding. <b>Transducers</b> are built with both normal DF peizoceramics, and those with abnormally high DF ceramics which caused production stoppages.
