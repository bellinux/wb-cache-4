5|$|Some studies shows {{correlation}} of reduced hippocampus volume and posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> (PTSD). A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% {{reduction in the}} volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans having suffered no such symptoms. This finding was not replicated in chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). A 2016 study strengthened theory that a smaller hippocampus increases the risk for post-traumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder,</b> and a larger hippocampus {{increases the likelihood of}} efficacious treatment.|$|E
40|$|International audienceEarly {{assessment}} {{is essential for}} subjects exposed to a potentially traumatic event. Symptoms of peritraumatic distress are often predictive of later posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorders</b> and should be treated promptly. Posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorders</b> should be treated rapidly, before they become chronic. It is also necessary to consider the frequent comorbidities: psychosomatic features, addictive disorders, and especially posttraumatic depression. Attempted suicide is 15 times more common in people with psychological trauma than in the general population.

5|$|There is {{one case}} study on maltreated twins {{published}} in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins {{between the ages of}} 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder.</b> The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.|$|E

40|$|In Europe, all {{countries}} regularly recognise mental disorders as workplace accidents (mainly post-traumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorders).</b> However, {{there has been}} little emphasis on this emerging issue in Italy. Our discussion focuses on a recent case report regarding an employee who was affected by an acute anxiety disorder after a common workplace conflict with a coworker. Given that prolonged and unresolved relationship conflicts may result in more extreme forms of conflict known as workplace bullying, relationship conflicts should be minimised or prevented as early as possible. These conflicts can also lead to acute <b>stress</b> <b>disorders,</b> particularly in workers who are at-risk for <b>stress</b> <b>disorders.</b> To prevent psychological work-related injuries, occupational stakeholders should use assessments for work-related stress as a framework for addressing all organisational risk factors that are related to workplace relationships and conflict...|$|R

5|$|The {{images and}} media reports of {{children}} dying terrorized many children who, {{as demonstrated by}} later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder.</b> Children became a primary focus of concern {{in the mental health}} response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of {{middle and high school students}} conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder.</b>|$|E
