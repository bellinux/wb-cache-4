50|$|There are two popular {{versions}} of a site map. An XML <b>Sitemap</b> is a structured format that a user doesn't need to see, but it tells the search engine about the pages in a site, their relative importance to each other, and how often they are updated. HTML sitemaps are designed for the user to help them find content on the page, and don't need to include each and every subpage. This helps visitors and search engine bots find pages on the site. You cannot submit an HTML <b>sitemap</b> in Google Webmaster Tools as {{it is not a}} supported <b>sitemap</b> format.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method to {{automatically}} discover <b>sitemaps</b> from websites. Given a website, existing automatic solutions extract only a flat list of urls that do not show the hierarchical structure of its content. Manual approaches, performed by web-masters, extract deeper <b>sitemaps</b> (with respect to automatic methods). However, in many cases, {{also because of the}} natural evolution of the websitesâ€™ content, generated <b>sitemaps</b> do not reflect the actual content becoming soon helpless and confusing for users. We propose a different approach that is both automatic and effective. Our solution combines an algorithm to extract frequent patterns from navigation systems (e. g. menu, nav-bar, content list, etc.) contained in a website, with a hierarchy extraction algorithm able to discover rich hierarchies that unveil relationships among web pages (e. g. relationships of super/sub topic). Experimental results, show how our approach discovers high quality <b>sitemaps</b> that have a deep hierarchy and are complete in the extracted urls...|$|R

A few months later Google announced, on their official blog, that they are adding support for specifying the rel="alternate" [...] and hreflang annotations in <b>Sitemaps.</b> Instead of the (until then only option) HTML link elements the <b>Sitemaps</b> option offered many advantages which included a smaller page size and easier deployment for some websites.|$|R

50|$|Since Bing, Yahoo, Ask, and Google use {{the same}} protocol, having a <b>Sitemap</b> lets the four biggest search engines have the updated page information. Sitemaps do not {{guarantee}} all links will be crawled, and being crawled does not guarantee indexing. However, a <b>Sitemap</b> {{is still the best}} insurance for getting a search engine to learn about your entire site. Google Webmaster Tools allow a website owner to upload a <b>sitemap</b> that Google will crawl, or they can accomplish {{the same thing with the}} robots.txt file. On 1st Dec 2016 both Bing and Google confirmed that they now support xml sitemaps up to 50MB in size while uncompressed.|$|E

Current Semantic Web publishing practices, however, do not directly support efficient discovery and high-performance retrieval by clients and search engines. We propose an extension to the <b>Sitemaps</b> protocol which provides a simple and effective solution: Data publishers create Semantic <b>Sitemaps</b> to announce and describe their data so that clients can choose the most appropriate access method.

40|$|The mycobacterial {{insertion}} sequence IS 6110 {{has been exploited}} extensively as a clonal marker in molecular epidemiologic studies of tuberculosis. In addition, it has been hypothesized that this element is an important driving force behind genotypic variability that may have phenotypic consequences. We present here a novel, DNA microarray-based methodology, designated <b>SiteMapping,</b> that simultaneously maps the locations and orientations of multiple copies of IS 6110 within the genome. To investigate the sensitivity, accuracy, and limitations of the technique, it was applied to eight Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains for which complete or partial IS 6110 insertion site information had been determined previously. <b>SiteMapping</b> correctly located 64 % (38 of 59) of the IS 6110 copies predicted by {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis. The technique is highly specific; 97 % of the predicted insertion sites were true insertions. Eight previously unknown insertions were identified and confirmed by PCR or sequencing. The performance could be improved by modifications in the experimental protocol and in the approach to data analysis. <b>SiteMapping</b> has general applicability and demonstrates an expansion in the applications of microarrays that complements conventional approaches in the study of genome architecture...|$|R
