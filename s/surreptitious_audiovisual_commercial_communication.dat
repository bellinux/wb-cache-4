At this point it investigates mainly the problems of a sign, the key element of semiotics. Furthermore it follows the development of the knowledge acquired through semiotics to other areas of research which help to detect the meanings of communication. Those areas are the levels of signification, thus denotation, connotation and myth. This chapter especially draws on Roland Barthes and his publication Mythology, which inspired this diploma thesis. The theoretical part continues by explanation of the main problems of commercial.

40|$|Serious Games: Video game design {{techniques}} for academic and <b>commercial</b> <b>communication,</b> by Christian Bull-Hansen, Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway. Traditional academic and <b>commercial</b> <b>communication</b> sources, like schools and television, are losing ground to video games. People {{of all ages}} spend increasingly more time engaged in virtual worlds and on the Internet, and are becoming used to actively pursuing the information {{they want to know}} more about, while rejecting the old passive communication channels where information is presented, but not requested. The result is a generation in need of new ways of informing. This thesis aims to provide ways for academic and <b>commercial</b> <b>communication</b> to exist in commercially popular video games while retaining the entertainment value of the games. Thus making students learn while gaming, as well as provide means for commercial interests to reach the gamer audience. The thesis provides information and analysis of game culture, player-types, social structures, game design techniques, and how knowledge of this information can be used to create and improve academic and <b>commercial</b> <b>communication</b> in video games. The thesis utilizes a custom made prototype, “The Renaissance Prototype”, designed for the purpose of researching and test the theories presented in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|The diploma thesis "EYOWF 2011 and mythologization of the {{commercial}} strategies in a market campaign" deals with a semiotic analysis and mythologization of the promotional video for 10 th European Youth Olympic Winter Festival 2011. This study is drawn up as semiotic analysis comprised of the theories of symbolic interactionism and mythologization as a secondary narrative. The thesis is based on theories of the meaning construction and the terminology of the linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, a French semiotican Ronald Barthes and a triadical concept of the sign by Charles Sanders Peirce. The study works {{on the construction of}} a <b>commercial</b> message, market <b>communication</b> and use of the specific sign as a primary structural element. An analyzed sample is an <b>audiovisual</b> <b>commercial</b> - 2 minutes and 52 seconds which contents the elements of the entire communicative campaign. The used method is a semiotic analysis which offers insights via description and interpretation of the particular encoded signs. The main focus is concentrating on the camera take and cuts, graphics, colour, characters and the entire mythologization process...|$|R

40|$|We {{live in a}} {{world where}} {{consumers}} actively resist marketing. So it’s important to stop marketing at people. The idea is to create an environment where consumers will market to each other 1. Definitely, this idea does not refer to direct marketing at people in the form of unsolicited <b>commercial</b> <b>communication,</b> i. e. spam! Spam is a teething trouble of direct marketing 2 through email. Spam is the bulkmailing, sometimes repeatedly, of unsolicited email messages, usually of a commercial nature, to individuals with whom the mailer has had no previous contact and whose email addresses the mailer collected from the public spaces of the Internet 3. The real problem for direct marketers is how to initiate permission-based direct marketing without interrupting people 4. Seth Godin 5 himself acknowledges that there is great danger for permission-marketing not to be able to eschew interruption-marketing completely in its initial phase. As just the moment that email has become an indispensable form of <b>communication</b> of <b>commercial</b> and non-commercial importance for an ever-growing segment of the world, its value is being undermined by the barrage of unsolicited communication. Email can be used to send unsolicited messages to many people at the same time such as advertisements. The sending of unsolicited <b>commercial</b> <b>communication</b> to many recipients is an easy way to reach a large audience. A significant difference between unsolicited <b>commercial</b> <b>communication</b> via email and conventiona...|$|R
