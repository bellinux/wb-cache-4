5|$|The album's lyrics {{have been}} {{described}} as an anthematic examination of the <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American working class and politically liberal. Along with highlighting the struggles of blue-collar America, the lyrics portray {{the idea that there is}} hope even when things appear to be bleak and that giving up is not an option. While there are Christian themes throughout the songs, neither Christian nor secular reviewers found them to be preachy.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Zhang's (r.75–88 AD) reign came to {{be viewed}} by later Eastern Han {{scholars}} as {{the high point of}} the dynastic house. Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imperial consort clans. With the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong (d. 107 AD), Emperor He (r.88–105 AD) had Empress Dowager Dou (d.97 AD) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power. This was in revenge for Dou's purging of the clan of his natural mother—Consort Liang—and then concealing her identity from him. After Emperor He's death, his wife Empress Deng Sui (d.121 AD) managed state affairs as the regent empress dowager during a turbulent financial crisis and widespread Qiang rebellion that lasted from 107 to 118 AD.|$|E

5|$|General Tuan Shi-wen died in 1980, and {{was buried}} in a pagoda-like tomb on a hilltop reached via a 300-metre (984ft) climb. From the top, there is a {{panoramic}} view of the village. There is also a memorial to the KMT soldiers who died in their fight against communism, The Martyrs' Memorial, a museum whose wooden panels bear the names of the dead, set on an altar in the main building. It was constructed in the style of a large Chinese shrine like the National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine in Taipei. The museum also features exhibits describing the <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> KMT soldiers and the development of the Doi Mae Salong valley.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{was well}} acquainted with the <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grub Street hack though, through the travails of his own father, Richard, who {{had been unable to}} make a living as writer and had {{eventually}} ended up at the Fleet Prison as a bankrupt. Hogarth may have been more than sympathetic to the dunce struggling with his rhymes. Jenny Uglow in her biography of Hogarth, posits that the gradual alteration of the prints above the poet's head could suggest a slow softening of attitudes towards Pope and his attack on the class of writer to which Hogarth's father had belonged, and perhaps evidence of Hogarth making his own compromises in his endeavours to become successful.|$|E
5|$|In 287 BC, the plebeians again seceded. To end the secession, the lex Hortensia was passed, which {{required}} that plebiscites, laws {{passed by the}} Plebeian Council, be binding on the whole Roman people. The Hortensian law resolved the last great political question of the earlier era; the electoral and legislative sovereignty of the assemblies was confirmed and would remain part of the constitution until {{the demise of the}} Republic. As a whole, the outcome of the political <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early republic was to eliminate the privileged status of patricians in the constitution and grant the plebs recognition of their own officers. The institution of the Senate was also now arguably stronger, as it became a repository of former magistrates rather than a body of hereditary nobles.|$|E

5|$|Moore {{used the}} story {{as a means to}} reflect {{contemporary}} anxieties and to deconstruct and parody the superhero concept. Watchmen depicts an alternate history where superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal was never exposed. In 1985, the country is edging toward World War III with the Soviet Union, freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the personal development and moral <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 17th century left a deep sectarian {{division in}} Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law {{of loyalty to}} the Irish King and Parliament. After {{the passing of the}} Test Act 1672, and with the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of William and Mary over the Jacobites, Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the Irish Parliament. Under the emerging Penal Laws, Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists. The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the Protestant Ascendancy.|$|E
5|$|The tiger {{salamander}} (Ambystoma tigrinum) {{is typical of}} the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates. Others amphibians, such as the Bufo spp. toads, actively search for prey, while the Argentine horned frog (Ceratophrys ornata) lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes. Among leaf litter frogs in Panama, frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim, often brightly coloured and toxic, while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well-camouflaged. Caecilians do not flick their tongues, but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward-pointing teeth. The <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow. The subdued prey is gulped down whole.|$|E

5|$|By mid-May it {{was clear}} that he would not make the Derby and he was removed from the race on the 23 May. Orme's trainer John Porter and Williams, the {{veterinary}} surgeon, remained convinced that he had been poisoned and was not just suffering from bad teeth. A reward of £1,000 was even offered for information that would lead to the conviction of the guilty party. The poisoning was investigated by George Lewis, a solicitor, who concluded that the horse had been poisoned. He stated that the horse was fine on the morning of the 21 April, but a few hours later his tongue was so inflamed he could not hold it in his mouth; something so sudden, Lewis argued, could not have been caused by a decaying tooth. He suggested that the poison may have in fact been attempted to be administered by some ball being put down his throat, but due to the <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horse, it burst in his mouth, blistering his tongue. The Derby was won by Sir Hugo, but many believed that Orme would have won easily had he made the race.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{he was not}} as steadfast as his father, and was easily swayed by the {{officials}} at court. The early period of his caliphate was dominated by the vizier al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah. A very able man, he was also ambitious; he had plotted to assassinate al-Mu'tadid shortly before the latter's death, and now ruthlessly eliminated any rivals for influence over the new caliph. Thus al-Qasim ordered {{the execution of the}} imprisoned Saffarid ruler, Amr ibn al-Layth, when al-Muktafi, immediately after his arrival in Baghdad asked after his well-being and indicated that he wanted to treat him well. Shortly after, the vizier managed to discredit al-Mu'tadid's loyal commander-in-chief, Badr al-Mu'tadidi. Badr was forced to flee Baghdad but surrendered after being promised a pardon by the vizier's agents, only to be executed on 14 August. A few days later, al-Qasim ordered the arrest of an uncle of the Caliph, Abd al-Wahid, a son of al-Muwaffaq, who never heard from again; and in September 903 al-Husayn ibn Amr al-Nasrani, a Christian secretary, whom al-Muktafi initially favoured and who opposed al-Qasim, was denounced and exiled, his offices being given to al-Qasim's sons, al-Husayn and Muhammad. Al-Qasim even succeeded in having his little daughter betrothed to one of al-Muktafi's infant sons, and his eminent position in the state was highlighted by the award, {{for the first time in}} the Islamic world, of a special honorific title, Wali al-Dawla. In the bureaucratic <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period, al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah favoured the Banu'l-Jarrah and resisted the pro-Shi'ite leanings of the Banu'l-Furat. The leading representative of the Banu'l-Furat, Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Furat, only escaped death due to the vizier's own death in 904. Before his death al-Qasim had nominated as his successors either al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i or Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah, but the latter refused the post, and Ali ibn al-Furat quickly gained the favour of al-Abbas al-Jarjara'i and the Caliph.|$|E
25|$|Trotskyists {{differ on}} the extent to which this is true today, but even the most {{orthodox}} tend to recognise in the late twentieth century a new development in the revolts of the rural poor, the self-organising <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landless, and many other struggles which in some ways reflect the militant united organised <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> working class, and which to various degrees do not bear the marks of class divisions typical of the heroic peasant struggles of previous epochs. However, orthodox Trotskyists today still argue that the town and city based working class struggle is central to the task of a successful socialist revolution, linked to these <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rural poor. They argue that the working class learns of necessity to conduct a collective struggle, for instance in trade unions, arising from its social conditions in the factories and workplaces, and that the collective consciousness it achieves as a result is an essential ingredient of the socialist reconstruction of society.|$|E
