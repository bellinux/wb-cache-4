25|$|After {{the first}} {{explosion}} on 19December, re-entry to the mine {{was carried out}} by mine rescue teams wearing breathing apparatus, until it was established that it was safe for the AWRE men to return. They found that the stemming in the crosscut had failed to contain the blast, which had destroyed the cables and control equipment for the second charge. This was repaired and the second explosion scheduled for 15January 1960. The evening before it was due, a group of Greenside men were finishing off some sandbagging. Two of these, who were not experienced underground workers, went off during their mid-evening break to visit a <b>stope</b> at the northern end of the mine, to collect pieces of white spar. They failed to return, and were found dead, overcome by gases that had lingered in the <b>stope.</b> The test was halted while more work was done to improve the extraction of gas from the explosion. The second test finally took place on 29April 1960. Venting the mine and checking for gases was carried out very thoroughly this time, and it was August 1960 before control of the mine was returned to the Greenside company.|$|E
25|$|The lead mines of Nantymwyn near Rhandirmwyn village some 8 {{miles away}} to the north {{may also have been}} first worked by the Romans, judging by hushing tanks and aqueducts found there in the 1970s both from {{fieldwork}} and aerial photographs. They occur {{at the top of the}} mountain called Pen-cerrig-mwyn, and the veins were followed underground by several tunnels leading to the workings. Inside, the veins have been removed and debris carefully stacked within the <b>stope.</b> The workings lie far above the later modern mines and processing plant (now derelict). The later mine was once the largest lead mine in Wales.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods include}} {{shrinkage}} <b>stope</b> mining, which is mining upward, creating a sloping underground room, long wall mining, which is grinding a long ore surface underground, and {{room and pillar}} mining, which is removing ore from rooms while leaving pillars in place to support {{the roof of the}} room. Room and pillar mining often leads to retreat mining, in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat, allowing the room to cave in, thereby loosening more ore. Additional sub-surface mining methods include hard rock mining, which is mining of hard rock (igneous, metamorphic or sedimentary) materials, bore hole mining, drift and fill mining, long hole slope mining, sub level caving, and block caving.|$|E
50|$|Henry <b>Stopes</b> (1852, Colchester - 1902, Greenhithe) was an English brewer, {{architect}} and amateur paleontologist of repute in late 19th century London. He amassed {{the largest private}} collection of fossils and lithic artefacts in Britain. He was the husband of Shakespearean scholar and feminist, Charlotte Carmichael <b>Stopes,</b> and father of Marie <b>Stopes,</b> the birth control advocate. <b>Stopes</b> was the first Briton to claim to have found Palaeolithic implements in the Thames river valley.|$|R

25|$|Once the {{new company}} had been formed in 1923, Murray's Shaft was {{connected}} to the 120Fathom Level, and then the Skip Shaft was abandoned. The 120Fathom Level became a major production level in the mine for the next thirty years. Murray's Shaft was deepened to the 135Fathom Level in 1924 and to the 150Fathom Level in 1928. Production during the early 1930s came from the four new levels below the 90Fathom Level. However, Murray's Shaft had been sunk on the vein in some rich ore-bearing ground which had been stoped away. Although the shaft was supported with steel girders and timbers, and the empty <b>stope</b> had been backfilled with rock, it was prone to collapses, when the supports gave way and waste rock poured into it. This happened (twice) in 1931 and again in 1933, bringing production to a halt while it was repaired.|$|E
25|$|Prospector Arthur Megson {{heard of}} their venture {{and decided to}} {{investigate}} {{near the town of}} Odendaalsrus in 1904. He gathered samples of exposed strata near an outcrop, which by then was part of Hendrik Petrus Klopper's farm Aandenk. He too did not succeed in obtaining any interest from companies until October 1932, when he presented his findings to Allan Roberts and Mannie Jacobs. The area needed to be tested by drilling, and the first borehole was started on 5 May 1933. Jacobs managed to interest two men, Fritz Marx and Peter Woolf, in the venture and the Wit Extensions Company was formed later that year. Although the borehole, which by then penetrated more than 1200 metres, yielded 120 inch pennyweights of gold (roughly 480 centimetre grams per ton), it was not enough to garner financial assistance and the operation had to close due to depleted finances. (For gold ores to be payable in South Africa, the grade must typically exceed 960 cengrams - the equivalent of 8 grams per ton over a 120cm <b>stope</b> width, which after dilution will yield 4g/t in the mill).|$|E
2500|$|The <b>stope,</b> {{which is}} the {{workshop}} of the mine, is the excavation from which the ore is extracted. Two methods of <b>stope</b> mining are commonly used. In the [...] "cut and fill" [...] or open stoping method, the space remaining following removal of ore after blasting is filled with waste rock and cement. In the [...] "shrinkage" [...] method, only sufficient broken ore is removed via the chutes below to allow miners working {{from the top of}} the pile to drill and blast the next layer to be broken off, eventually leaving a large hole. Another method, known as room and pillar, is used for thinner, flatter ore bodies. In this method the ore body is first divided into blocks by intersecting drives, removing ore while so doing, and then systematically removing the blocks, leaving enough ore for roof support.|$|E

2500|$|Larry Knight (44), Brant Webb (37) and Todd Russell (34), {{were the}} three miners who {{remained}} unaccounted for. Knight {{had been killed}} in the initial rockfall, but Webb and Russell were still alive, trapped in part of the vehicle in which they had been working {{at the time of the}} collapse, known as a teleloader or telehandler. They were in a basket at the end of the telehandler's arm, where they had been applying steel mesh to a barricade prior to backfilling a <b>stope.</b> It was initially misreported that the two miners were saved by a slab of rock that fell on top of the basket, but in a Channel 9 exclusive interview broadcast on 21 May, Webb and Russell stated that this was incorrect and that the [...] "ceiling" [...] above them was merely thousands of individual unstable rocks precariously packed together.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1850s and 1860s some ore {{was still}} being won from the old levels {{in the top of}} the mountain, but the main ore-producing stopes were above and below the High and Low Levels. By the end of the 1850s the Low Level had been driven [...] north of the Engine Shaft. Below it, the 36Fathom Level was being {{extended}} in both directions. Although ore was at first very patchy in that level, stopes had been opened above it in both headings by 1858, and also a sump had gone down to 48fathoms, where a new level was being driven. A major rock fall occurred in 1862 (or 1865), known as [...] "The Big Crush." [...] Miners had cut away two parallel strings of lead ore above the High Horse Level, leaving an unsupported pendant of rock between them. This rock, [...] in length and depth, and [...] thick, fell, crushing its way down the <b>stope</b> to the level below, and removing the floor of Gilgower's Level above. Fortunately this happened one Sunday, when no one was in the mine. In 1870 the new Lucy Tongue Level was connected to the south end of the 48Fathom Level, by sinking a sump from above and working a rise from below. Already the new level had discovered some rich ore at the south end of the vein, and in the following years it was steadily driven north.|$|E

At six weeks old, her parents took <b>Stopes</b> from Scotland; the family stayed briefly in Colchester then moved to London, where in 1880 her father bought 28 Cintra Park in Upper Norwood. Both of her parents {{were members of the}} British Association for the Advancement of Science, where they had met. Marie was taken to meetings where she met the famous scholars of the day. At first, she was home-schooled, but from 1892 to 1894 she attended St George's School for Girls in Edinburgh. <b>Stopes</b> was later sent to the North London Collegiate School, where she was a close friend of Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn.|$|R

2500|$|They {{followed}} the veins with shafts and tunnels underground, {{some of which}} still exist on the site. The remains of Roman dewatering machines were found during the 1880s and the 1920s when the Rio Tinto mines in Spain were being mined by opencast methods. [...] At Dolaucothi, a similar discovery was made in 1935 during mining operations, and it included part of a reverse overshot water-wheel which {{is now in the}} National Museum of Wales. It was found with burnt timbers, suggesting that fire-setting was used to help break up the hard quartz in which the gold was trapped. A similar but larger wheel was rediscovered during mine operations at Rio Tinto in Spain, and is now in the British Museum, where it is displayed prominently in the Roman gallery. The Spanish example included a sequence of no fewer than 16 reverse overshot water-wheels, each pair of wheels feeding water to the next set in the sequence. Each wheel would have been worked like a treadwheel, from the side rather than at the top, {{but it would have been}} a hard and lonely activity for the miners working these wheels lifting water from the mine bottom. Since the fragment of a reverse overshot water-wheel was found 160 feet below any known adit or <b>stope,</b> it must have been part of a similar sequence at Dolaucothi to that in Spain. Gold mining was sophisticated and technologically advanced at Dolaucothi, suggesting that the Roman army itself pioneered exploitation at the site. The construction of such dewatering machines is described by the Roman engineer Vitruvius writing in 25 BC, and their use for irrigation and lifting water in thermae was widespread.|$|E
