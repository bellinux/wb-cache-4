5|$|Modern writers {{also argue}} that Black has certain countervailing advantages. The {{consensus}} that White <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> win can be a psychological burden for the white player, who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win. Some symmetrical openings (i.e. those where both players make the same moves) can lead to situations where moving first is a disadvantage, either for psychological or objective reasons.|$|E

5|$|The Red Sox chose Ruffing to {{be their}} Opening Day {{starting}} pitcher for the 1929 season. During the 1929 season, he again led the AL in losses, with 22, and earned runs, with 135. He won only nine games. Ruffing often had difficulty pitching more than five innings in a game. Someone in the Red Sox organization suggested to Ruffing that he <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> gain weight by drinking beer, which saw him grow from 185pounds (84kg) to 240 pounds (110kg).|$|E
5|$|When Ruffing was 15 years old, he {{suffered}} an {{accident in the}} mine, where his left foot was crushed between two cars. Though the doctor was able to save his foot, Red lost four toes. He was supposed to begin his professional baseball career in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League that year, but he found himself unable to run {{as fast as he}} previously could. Doc Bennett, the manager of a nearby semi-professional team, suggested that Ruffing <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> continue pursuing a baseball career by becoming a pitcher.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in the Dunphy family, Dylan (Reid Ewing), Haley's boyfriend, tags {{along on}} the trip, much to Claire's chagrin. However, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{eventually}} convinces her that she <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get to know Dylan. She attempts to, but suddenly Dylan proposes to Haley (Sarah Hyland) around the campfire one night. This causes Claire (Julie Bowen) to instantly say no for Haley, leading to Dylan running away. The families go off and look for him, during which Haley criticizes Claire for interfering and reveals {{she would not have}} accepted Dylan's proposal. It is also revealed that Dylan gets a job at the ranch and decides to permanently stay in Wyoming, breaking up with Haley.|$|E

5|$|Smallpeice {{initially}} held {{discussions in}} 1965 with {{the newly formed}} Overseas Containers group, which {{was focused on the}} UK to Australia and Far East routes, about Cunard's Port Line subsidiary and Ronald Vestey's Blue Star Line joining British and Commonwealth Shipping, Furness Withy, P and the Ocean Steamship Company in the joint venture. Their approaches were rebuffed, and it was quickly decided that Cunard and Blue Star Line <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> form a rival group, which would be called Associated Container Transportation. The venture was formed in late 1965 and early 1966, with the first board meeting taking place on 12 January 1966. Cunard's Port Line and Vestey's Blue Star Line were joined by Ben Line, Ellerman Lines and Harrison Line in the venture. Alexander Hull from Ellerman Lines was the inaugural chairman, but following his death in April 1967, Smallpeice took over as chairman of Associated Container Transportation.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientists}} at Columbia {{decided that they}} <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium when bombarded by neutrons. On 25 January 1939, {{in the basement of}} Pupin Hall at Columbia, an experimental team including Fermi conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States. The other members of the team were Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, John R. Dunning, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack. The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, which fostered many more experimental demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|Their {{ideas were}} well {{received}} by TSR, whose marketing department {{felt they had}} enough dungeons, but not enough dragons. Hickman suggested a series of twelve modules, each featuring a different dragon. TSR employee Harold Johnson suggested that Hickman <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get additional support from other TSR staff members and, {{after a period of}} months, Hickman had the support of Jeff Grubb, Larry Elmore, Roger Moore, Doug Niles, Michael Williams, and others with whom they discussed ideas for the project. Meanwhile, Weis was editing and writing various Endless Quest books for TSR. The Dragonlance group decided that novels should accompany the game modules; TSR reluctantly agreed and hired a writer. Hickman became the design coordinator for Project Overlord, the cover name for what would later be known as the Dragonlance saga.|$|E

5|$|A {{turning point}} of the game came on the first {{possession}} of the second half. The Giants received the second half kickoff, and led a short drive that stalled at their own 47-yard line. On fourth and 1, the Giants lined up in a punt formation before shifting to a traditional set. Second string quarterback Jeff Rutledge then looked over to Parcells for a signal {{as to whether he}} <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> draw the defense offside or run a play. After a nod of approval from Parcells, he ran a quarterback sneak for a first down. The Giants scored on the drive, and built a 39–13 lead before a late touchdown by the Broncos made the final score 39–20. Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro and Phil McConkey to give him three on the game, and Joe Morris and Ottis Anderson each rushed for one touchdown. The Giants' defense limited the Broncos to only two net yards and 10 offensive plays in the third quarter. The 30 second half points set a Super Bowl-record for points in a half, and Simms was named MVP after completing 22 of 25 (88%) of his passes—a Super Bowl record which still stands.|$|E
5|$|The High Sparrow chides Queen Margaery Tyrell {{that she}} needs to provide King Tommen Baratheon with an heir, and that she <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> convert her {{grandmother}} Olenna to the Faith, subtly remarking that Olenna's safety cannot be guaranteed otherwise. Margaery meets with Olenna, who attempts to convince her to leave King's Landing and return to Highgarden. Margaery refuses, stating that as Queen, her place is supposed to be at King Tommen's side. Margaery discreetly slips her a piece of paper with the sigil of House Tyrell drawn on it, indicating that she is still loyal to her family, upon which Olenna agrees to leave. Cersei Lannister then confronts Olenna, and tries to convince her to stay and fight the Sparrows. Olenna points out that they have already lost and blames the Sparrows' rise to power on Cersei's lack of foresight. Despite having no allies in King's Landing, Cersei decides to stay and fight.|$|E

25|$|There {{are five}} vices (habitual desires) {{outlined}} in the Guru Granth Sahib that one <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> control.

However, Sikhs that are more accepting of homosexuality claim that this is equally applicable to heterosexuals. These same Sikhs believe that Guru Nanak's emphasis on universal equality and brotherhood is fundamentally {{in support of the}} human rights of homosexuals.|$|E

Greece claims a right to unilateral expansion to 12 nautical miles, based on the International Law of the Sea. Turkey, which already has expanded its own territorial waters to 12 miles on its other coasts, denies {{the applicability of the}} 12-miles rule in the Aegean and has threatened Greece with war in the case it <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> apply it unilaterally.|$|E
25|$|Camarilla {{policy is}} that vampires <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> fit in with and hide {{from the rest of}} humanity, as to easily feed on them. For this reason, they created a web of lies and misinformation, called the Masquerade, to make the public believe that supernatural beings like vampires could not {{possibly}} exist. The Camarilla also believes that the only way the vampire species can survive in these modern nights is if it unites—any breach of the Masquerade by any vampire risks exposing the entire race. Both viewpoints are fundamentally opposed by the Sabbat.|$|E
25|$|Architecturally, Lawson's work on {{the asylum}} was very exuberant, making some of his {{previous}} designs look comparatively tame. The asylum had turrets on corbels projecting from nearly every corner, with the gabled roof line dominated by a large tower complete with further turrets and a spire. The building contained {{four and a half}} million bricks made of local clay on the site and was 225 metres long by 67 metres wide. The great central tower of 50 m height, an essential element of many revivalist designs, was also proposed to double as an observation tower if inmates <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> escape.|$|E
