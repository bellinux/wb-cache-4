This can not be assured by a simple study of the context. Gnosticism's beginnings {{and its relationship to}} Christianity are poorly dated, due to an insufficient corpus of literature relating the first interactions between the two religions. It vehemently condemns such anti-corporeal attitudes, which also indicates that those taking such unorthodox positions were either <b>sufficiently</b> vocal, <b>persuasive,</b> or numerous enough to warrant rebuttal in this form.

One suggestion for the problems of energy-starved post-war Europe was to propel railway wagons by human muscle power - employing 20 to 30 men on bicycle-like mechanisms to pedal a cyclo-tractor. Pyke reasoned that the energy in a pound of sugar cost about the same as an equivalent energy in the form of coal and that while Europe had plenty of sugar and unemployed people, there was a shortage of coal and oil. He recognised that such a use of human muscle power was in some ways distasteful, but he could not see that the logic of arguments about calories and coal were unlikely to be <b>sufficiently</b> <b>persuasive.</b>|$|E

40|$|See {{the article}} by Kim et al, on pages 381 – 389.)

In the years after its approval, most physicians became confident of both the efficacy and safety of the drug. However, in 2007 came a surprising turn of events.

40|$|From {{a rhetorical}} perspective, Mendel’s work and its {{reception}} elicit two important questions: (a) why were Mendel’s arguments so compelling to 20 th century biologists? And (b) why where they so roundly ignored by his con-temporaries? The {{focus of this}} article is to examine the latter question while commenting on the former by employing several tactics for rhetorical analy-sis including historical, textual, and audience analyses. These analyses sug-gest that Mendel’s argument resembles 20 th century biological arguments in its use of mathematical principles and formulae to both inform the design of experiments and support the law-like regularity of conclusions. These proce-dures, however, were not regarded by his audience of hybridists, botanists, cytologists, and naturalists as <b>sufficiently</b> <b>persuasive</b> or necessarily even legitimate. I will argue that had he taken a more rhetorical tact and consid-ered the position of his audience on the legitimacy of the scope of his con-clusions, his methods for making arguments, and his assumptions about heritable characters perhaps his arguments wouldn’t have fallen on deaf ears...|$|E

In the opinion of the investigator, Calidex Corporation, if the business strategies later prove to be successful, then the plan model has relevance for any technology licensee attempting to accumulate resources and bridge from technology resident in government laboratories to the commercial marketplace. The study utilized SciBus Analytical, Inc. (SciBus), a Los Alamos National Laboratory CRADA participant, as the paradigm small business technology licensee.

40|$|Animals sample their {{surrounding}} environment to collect information, {{which can be}} obtained personally or by tracking the behavior of others (i. e., social information). Although social information appears to be generally advantageous, {{it can also be}} detrimental and may even conflict with personal information. We tested the effect that the strength of social information, and ultimately its persuasiveness, can have on an animal's decision to use it or not by conducting an experiment using single nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura punctulata), which were offered a foraging choice after observation of videos of feeding or nonfeeding conspecifics. The persuasiveness of social information was amplified by increasing the number and changing the behavior of conspecifics that had previously been seen feeding at 1 of 2 feeders. In addition, we modulated the certainty of an individual's personal information. Some birds had prior experience of a marked feeder always containing easily accessible food, whereas other birds experienced that this was only the case in half of the trials. Our results show that animals provided with <b>sufficiently</b> <b>persuasive</b> social information will tend to reduce the weight of even highly reliable personal information. This provides the first experimental evidence consistent with the propagation of informational cascades in nonhuman animals, which have been invoked to explain market crashes in economics or panic rushes in human crowds.

40|$|Abstract. Severity {{assessments}} enable prioritization {{of problems}} encountered during usability evaluations and thereby provide a device for guiding {{the utilization of}} design resources. However, designers ’ response to usability evaluations is also influenced by other factors, which may overshadow severity. With the purpose of enhancing the impact of severity assessments, this study combines a field study of factors that influence the impact of evaluations with an experimental study of severity assessments made during usability inspections. The results show that even in a project receptive to input from evaluations their impact was highly dependent on conducting evaluations early. This accorded with an informal method that blended elements of usability evaluation and participatory design and could be extended with user-made severity assessments. The major cost associated with the evaluations was not finding but fixing problems, emphasizing that to be effective severity assessments must be reliable, valid, and <b>sufficiently</b> <b>persuasive</b> to justify the cost of fixing problems. For the usability inspections, evaluators ’ ratings of problem impact and persistence were weakly correlated {{with the number of}} evaluators reporting a problem, indicating that different evaluators represent different subgroups of users or alternatively that evaluator-made severity assessments are of questionable reliability. To call designers’ attention to the severe problems, the halving of the severity sum is proposed as a means of visualizing the large payoff of fixing a high-severity problem and, conversely, the modest potential of spending resources on lowseverity problems...|$|E

This article describes and assesses the planning, performance, and outcome of this initiative, branded ORCID @ CMU. Design and Methods: The article chronicles why and how ORCID was integrated at CMU, including the rationale for changes in strategic plans. It assesses researcher participation in the project using transaction log and content analyses, {{and the performance of}} the ORCID project team using recommendations in the Jisc ORCID project report, frankly reporting the team’s successes and failures. The article concludes with lessons learned that should inform ORCID integration projects and expectations at other institutions. Results: The ORCID @ CMU web application was a great success. However, the project team did not allow enough time to prepare or devote enough attention to advocacy. The marketing message was not <b>sufficiently</b> <b>persuasive</b> and the marketing channels were not particularly effective. The overall participation rate in ORCID @ CMU was far below the target of 40 %, though participation in many demographics exceeded the goal. Conclusions: Strategic planning does not guarantee success. Secure more than lip service from senior administrators. Recruit champions from across the institution. Develop a message that resonates with researchers. Allow sufficient time to prepare. Empower the project manager. Start with the low hanging fruit.

The {{article focuses}} {{on the issue of}} the {{international}} arbitral tribunals’ authority to disregard supposedly applicable statutory provisions of a given national law, which it deems to be non-compliant with relevant constitutional norms from the perspective of the Polish constitutional and arbitration law. Due to the fact that, in recent years, the present issue attracted a significant attention from the international academia, the analysis of the article begins with the report of various positions adopted by some of the leading international scholars on the matter in question. This initial study provides a firm basis for further exploration of this issue in light of the Polish law, which is preceded by a brief summary of the fundamental constitutional principles and notions underpinning the contemporary Polish legal order. Such critical analysis drives the author to a conclusion that there are no <b>sufficiently</b> <b>persuasive</b> arguments which would justify barring international arbitrators from applying the Polish substantive law in its entirety, including denying application of provisions violating the Constitution, which will supersede other normative acts. Conversely, the exercise of such arbitral review amounts to a basic duty of arbitrators (integral part of their mandate to resolve a dispute in accordance with the Polish law as the applicable substantive law of a dispute) rather than their discretionary authority...|$|E
40|$|Ethics {{has always}} been an {{important}} element in economic activities. Ethical guidelines in the form of values, beliefs, norms, guidelines and rules have been developed over the years to set boundaries for appropriate business behaviour. Although time and context may have changed, the core of ethical problems inherent in business remains. In recent years, increased public concerns about corporate ethics have seen extant ethical rules being codified into formal codes of ethics. As a crucial part of corporate discourse, a code of ethics of an organisation signals its ethical commitment to self-restraint and selfregulation. It is often observed that corporate codes are instituted only after some legitimacy-threatening events and that they are used as a strategy to restore trust and organisational legitimacy. The impetus for this study arose from a desire to provide an understanding of the discursive role of corporate codes of ethics in (re) claiming public trust and legitimacy in light of increasing challenges to corporate legitimacy. As corporate codes are taken as the basis for discourses designed to provide ethical guidance, they constitute an important means to uphold trust and legitimacy for organisations. The study examines 100 global corporate codes of ethics using a three-level analytical framework based on discourse theory to capture the relationship between the “text” and the “context” of the codes. In the process of discourse analysis, it explores the historical (inclusive of cultural, social, and economic) context of code development (macro level), employs institutional theory to interpret the institutional context of corporations (meso level), and examines the content/text of the codes (micro level) by drawing on Aristotle’s three rhetorical justifications (logos, ethos, and pathos) to ascertain how the sample companies persuade their audiences to accept their ethical commitments. There is evidence that the code language employed by the 100 sample global companies is <b>sufficiently</b> <b>persuasive</b> to support the pragmatic, cognitive, and moral legitimising causes. However, it is found that the content of codes is comparatively light in ethical substance as it tends to focus on behavioural constraints specifically designed to address the pressing legitimacy issues and the compliance of rules relating to these constraints...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{learning}} {{problem of a}} set of agents connected via a general social network. We address the question of how dispersed information spreads in social networks and whether the information is efficiently aggregated in large societies. The models developed in this thesis allow us to study the learning behavior of rational agents embedded in complex networks. We analyze the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of a dynamic game where each agent sequentially receives a signal about an underlying state of the world, observes the past actions of a stochastically-generated neighborhood of individuals, and chooses one of two possible actions. The stochastic process generating the neighborhoods defines the network topology (social network). We characterize equilibria for arbitrary stochastic and deterministic social networks and characterize the conditions under which there will be asymptotic learning [...] that is, the conditions under which, as the social network becomes large, the decisions of the individuals converge (in probability) to the right action. We show that when private beliefs are unbounded (meaning that the implied likelihood ratios are unbounded), there will be asymptotic learning {{as long as there is}} some minimal amount of expansion in observations. This result therefore establishes that, with unbounded private beliefs, there will be asymptotic learning in almost all reasonable social networks. Furthermore, we provide bounds on the speed of learning for some common network topologies. We also analyze when learning occurs when the private beliefs are bounded. (cont.) We show that asymptotic learning does not occur in many classes of network topologies, but, surprisingly, it happens in a family of stochastic networks that has infinitely many agents observing the actions of neighbors that are not <b>sufficiently</b> <b>persuasive.</b> Finally, we characterize equilibria in a generalized environment with heterogeneity of preferences and show that, contrary to a nave intuition, greater diversity (heterogeneity) 3 facilitates asymptotic learning when agents observe the full history of past actions. In contrast, we show that heterogeneity of preferences hinders information aggregation when each agent observes only the action of a single neighbor. by Ilan Lobel. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Concepts, models, or {{theories}} {{that end up}} shaping practices, whether those practices fall in the domains of science, technology, social movements, or business, always emerge through a change in language use. First, communities begin to talk differently, incorporating new vocabularies (Rorty, 1989), in their narratives. Whether the community’s new narratives respond to perceived anomalies or failures of the existing ones (Kuhn, 1962) or actually reveal inadequacies by addressing previously unrecognized practices (Fleck, 1979; Rorty, 1989) is less important here than the very phenomena that they introduce differences. Then, if the new language proves to be useful, for example, because it helps the community solve a problem or create a possibility that existing narratives do not, the new narrative will begin circulating more broadly throughout the community. If other communities learn of the usefulness of these new narratives, and find them <b>sufficiently</b> <b>persuasive,</b> they may be compelled to test, modify, and eventually adopt them. Of primary importance {{is the idea that}} a new concept or narrative perceived as useful {{is more likely to be}} adopted. We can expect that business concepts emerge through a similar pattern. Concepts such as “competitive advantage,” “disruption,” and the “resource based view,” now broadly known and accepted, were each at some point first introduced by a community. This community experimented with the concepts they introduced and found them useful. The concept “competitive advantage,” for example, helped researchers better explain why some firm’s outperformed others and helped practitioners more clearly understand what choices to make to improve the profit and growth prospects of their firms. The benefits of using these terms compelled other communities to consider, apply, and eventually adopt them as well. Were these terms not viewed as useful, they would not likely have been adopted. This thesis attempts to observe and anticipate new business concepts that may be emerging. It does so by seeking to observe a community of business practitioners that are using different language and appear to be more successful than a similar community of practitioners that are have not yet begun using this different language as extensively. It argues that if the community that is adopting new types of narratives is perceived as being more successful, their success will attract the attention of other communities who may then seek to adopt the same narratives. Specifically, this thesis compares the narratives used by a set of firms that are considered to be performing well (called Winners) with those of set of less-successful peers (called Losers). It does so with the aim of addressing two questions: - How do the strategic narratives that circulate within “winning” companies and their leaders differ from those circulating within “losing” companies and their leaders? - Given the answer to the first question: what new business strategy concepts are likely to emerge in the business community at large? I expected to observe “winning” companies shifting their language, abandoning an older set of narratives for newer ones. However the analysis indicates a more interesting dynamic: “winning” companies adopt the same core narratives as their “losing” peers with equal frequency yet they go beyond these. Both “winners” and “losers” seem to pursue economies of scale, customer captivity, best practices, and securing preferential access to resources with similar vigor. But “winners” seem to go further, applying three additional narratives in their pursuits of competitive advantage. They speak of coordinating what is uncoordinated, adopting what this thesis calls “exchanging the role of guest for that of host,” and “forcing a two-front battle” more frequently than their “loser” peers. Since these “winning” companies are likely perceived as being more successful, the unique narratives they use are more likely to be emulated and adopted. Understanding in what ways winners speak differently, therefore, gives us a glimpse into the possible future evolution of business concepts...|$|E
