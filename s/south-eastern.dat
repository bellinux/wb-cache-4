5|$|After the Battle of Leros, New Zealand withdrew its {{squadron}} {{from the}} Long Range Desert Group, compelling the LRDG to reorganise itself into two squadrons of eight patrols each. A Squadron {{was composed of}} Rhodesians and B Squadron comprised British troops and a squadron of signallers; around 80 of the officers and men were from Southern Rhodesia. The group was reassigned from the Middle East Command to the Central Mediterranean Force in early 1944, and deployed to the Gargano peninsula in <b>south-eastern</b> Italy, where a new LRDG headquarters was set up near the seaside town of Rodi. Britain hoped to compel the Germans to commit as many divisions as possible to <b>south-eastern</b> Europe so {{they could not be}} used on the more important fronts closer to Germany. In June 1944 the LRDG was assigned to operate on the western coast of Yugoslavia, with orders to set up observation posts, report the movements of German ships and undertake minor raids.|$|E

5|$|The male red-tailed black {{cockatoo}} courts by puffing up crest and cheek feathers, {{and hiding}} the beak; it then sings and struts, {{ending in a}} jump and a flash of red tail feathers toward the female who will most often reply by defensively biting him. Breeding generally takes place from May to September except {{in the case of}} the <b>South-eastern</b> subspecies, which nests during summer (December to February). Pairs of the subspecies samueli in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia may produce two broods, while those of <b>South-eastern</b> subspecies only produce one. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. Hollows can be 1 to 2metres (3–7ft) deep and 0.25–0.5metres (10–20in) wide, with a base of woodchips. A clutch consists of 1 to 2 white, lustreless eggs, although the second chick is in most cases neglected and perishes in infancy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>south-eastern</b> red-tailed black {{cockatoo}} subspecies C. b. graptogyne {{is listed}} as endangered on Schedule 7 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 of South Australia. and is {{the smallest of the}} species. Though a June, 2012 count of approximately 1500 individuals is a notable increase from the 2007 count of just 1000, it remains in danger of extinction.|$|E

5|$|The grey-headed {{flying fox}} is endemic to the <b>south-eastern</b> forested areas of Australia, principally {{east of the}} Great Dividing Range.

5|$|There weren't {{very many}} Cossacks {{in the mid}} 16th century in the <b>south-eastern</b> borderlands of Lithuania and Poland yet, but the first {{companies}} of Cossack light cavalry had become incorporated into the Polish armed forces already around that time.
