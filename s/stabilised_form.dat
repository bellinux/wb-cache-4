Both {{the quality and quantity}} of collagen decrease in ageing skin, often due to the effect of external factors such as exposure to the sun, especially UVA radiation. The result of this cross-linking is that the skin loses its elasticity. In the past, topical application of soluble animal collagen was used in an attempt to stimulate the formation of collagen in the skin. However, these tests were unsuccessful, as collagen cannot penetrate the epidermis. Vitamin C is known to stimulate collagen formation but has the disadvantage of being unstable in cosmetic formulations.

The resulting category of image I have termed Floppy Realism, to describe a representative act where forms or objects become slippery and difficult to grasp. Such a position is central to my practice. This essay maps the topography of Floppy Realism, taking the work of Giorgio Morandi and Mark Rothko as fluid points parenthesising this malleability.

40|$|AbstractDespite {{the great}} {{progress}} recently made in resolving their structures, {{investigation of the}} structural biology of membrane proteins still presents major challenges. Even with new technical advances such as lipidic cubic phase crystallisation, obtaining well-ordered crystals remains a significant hurdle in membrane protein X-ray crystallographic studies. As an alternative, electron microscopy {{has been shown to}} be capable of resolving > 3. 5 Å resolution detail in membrane proteins of modest (~ 300 kDa) size, without the need for crystals. However, the conventional use of detergents for either approach presents several issues, including the possible effects on structure of removing the proteins from their natural membrane environment. As an alternative, it has recently been demonstrated that membrane proteins can be effectively isolated, in the absence of detergents, using a styrene maleic acid co-polymer (SMA). This approach yields SMA lipid particles (SMALPs) in which the membrane proteins are surrounded by a small disk of lipid bilayer encircled by polymer. Here we use the Escherichia coli secondary transporter AcrB as a model membrane protein to demonstrate how a SMALP scaffold can be used to visualise membrane proteins, embedded in a near-native lipid environment, by negative stain electron microscopy, yielding structures at a modest resolution in a short (days) timeframe. Moreover, we show that AcrB within a SMALP scaffold is significantly more active than the equivalent DDM <b>stabilised</b> <b>form.</b> The advantages of SMALP scaffolds within electron microscopy are discussed and we conclude that they may prove to be an important tool in studying membrane protein structure and function...|$|E

The medium is also supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS), which can vary significantly between different batches. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the need for FBS during corneal organ culture, and to determine whether substitution of L-glutamine by the stable dipeptide L-analyl-L-glutamine was beneficial. METHODS: Porcine corneoscleral discs were suspended in 80 ml of organ culture medium (HEPES buffered Eagle's MEM with Earle's salts, 26 mmol/l NaHCO 3, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B) and kept at 34 degrees C. The medium contained either 2 mmol/l L-glutamine or 2 mmol/l L-analyl-L-glutamine, and was either serum free or contained 2 % FBS. At weekly intervals, five corneas from each group were stained with trypan blue and alizarin red S, and the surface area and shape of 100 endothelial cells were determined for each cornea. RESULTS: No differences were observed between corneas in organ culture medium with L-glutamine or L-analyl-L-glutamine. In serum free medium, endothelial cell density remained constant for the first week, but then declined rapidly over the next 2 weeks. With 2 % FBS, there was no loss of endothelial cells for the first 2 weeks, but cell density had halved by the fourth week of organ culture. CONCLUSION: The presence of 2 % FBS extended the period of endothelial stability, but no advantage was gained from the <b>stabilised</b> <b>form</b> of L-glutamine. The overall loss of endothelial cells was much greater than would be expected for human corneas...|$|E
40|$|Technology Acquisition is an {{important}} but neglected issue within the social science analysis of technology. The limited number of studies undertaken reproduce a schism between rationalist (e. g., economic) forms of analysis, where {{the assumption is that}} choice is the outcome of formal assessment, and cultural sociological approaches which see choice as driven by the micro-politics of the organisational setting, interests, prevalent rhetorics, fads, etc. While sympathetic to the latter critical view, we are dissatisfied with the relativist portrayal of technology selection: that decisions, beset with uncertainties and tensions, are divorced from formal decision making criteria. Influenced by Michel Callon’s writing on the ‘performativity’ of economic concepts and tools, we argue that formal assessment has a stronger relationship to technology decisions than suggested by cultural sociologists. We focus on a procurement which is characterised by high levels of organisational tension and where there is deep uncertainty about each of the solutions on offer. We show how the procurement team are able to arrive at a decision through laboriously constructing a ‘comparison’. That is, they attempt to drag the choice from the informal domain onto a more formal, accountable plane through the mobilisation and performance of a number of ‘comparative measures’ and criteria. These measures constituted a <b>stabilised</b> <b>form</b> of accountability, which we describe through the metaphor of a ‘scaffolding’, erected {{in the course of the}} procurement. Our argument is threefold: first, we argue that comparisons are possible but that they require much effort; second, that it is not the properties of the technology which determines choice but the way these properties were given form through the various comparative measures put in place; and finally whilst comparative measures might be imposed by one group upon others in a procurement team, these measures remain relatively malleable...|$|E

30|$|Though the {{plasticity}} of macrophages {{in vitro}} and in vivo, which suggests functional adaptivity, {{has been documented}} [12]-[14],[119]-[121], the reversal of the phenotype does not always occur and may depend upon the state of macrophage differentiation. For example, while PPARγ activation primes monocytes to adopt an M 2 phenotype, it does not influence M 2 marker expression in M 1 macrophages nor does it influence the expression of M 2 markers in human atherosclerotic lesions [115]. Furthermore, while M-CSF and IL- 10 promote {{the formation of an}} M 2 c macrophage and accordingly high levels of expression of MERTK and ability to clear apoptotic cells [49], chronic pre-exposure of the cells to IFN-γ or IL- 4 prior to exposure with IL- 10 down regulates MERTK, leading instead to the cells up-regulating Fas (CD 95) and undergoing apoptosis [92]. In addition, M-CSF was unable to significantly induce CD 163 expression on monocytes pre-exposed to CXCL 4 [50]. Clearly a greater understanding of macrophage function in the plaque, their plasticity (or lack thereof) and the pathways involved is required to ensure that a plaque <b>stabilising</b> <b>form</b> can be promoted.|$|R
40|$|The gas-phase {{reaction}} of alkenes with ozone {{has been the}} subject of considerable research interest over several decades owing to the key role it plays in the Earth's atmosphere. Alkene-ozone reactions are widely recognised as a significant non-photolytic source of radicals, initiating further oxidation and contributing to the overall tropospheric HOx budget, which can be dominant under certain conditions. Central to the ozonolysis reaction mechanism is the formation of energy-rich Criegee Intermediates (CIs). Vibrationally excited CIs can either undergo unimolecular decomposition (to give OH, HO 2 and RO 2 radicals, yields dependent on CI structure) or can be collisionally <b>stabilised</b> <b>forming</b> <b>stabilised</b> CIs (SCIs), stabilised vinyl hydroperoxides (SVHP) and dioxirane (DIOX) species, which are available to take part in bimolecular reactions. Taatjes and co-workers, directly observing low-pressure CI kinetics for the first time, recently reported that the reactions of the CH 2 OO SCI (Welz et al., Science, 2012) and the anti-conformer of the CH 3 CHOO SCI (Taatjes et al., Science, 2013) with SO 2 are much faster than originally thought. Therefore, bimolecular SCI reactions can potentially make a substantial contribution to tropospheric SO 2 oxidation, implying more rapid formation of SO 3, a precursor of sulfate aerosol, with implications for heterogeneous chemistry and direct/indirect climate forcing - an observation substantiated by H 2 SO 4 field measurements (Maudlin et al., Nature, 2012). Here we present results from a series of ozonolysis experiments performed at the EUPHORE atmospheric simulation chamber, Valencia. We report direct radical measurements (OH, HO 2 and RO 2) for a range of small alkenes (ethene - isoprene). The loss of SO 2 in the presence of various important alkene ozonolysis systems, as a function of water vapour, have also been used to derive SCI decomposition rates as well as rate constants for reactions with H 2 O under atmospheric boundary layer conditions. The results are discussed in terms of mechanistic insight and atmospheric implications...|$|R
40|$|Model {{systems of}} the alkane {{skeletal}} isomerisation catalyst sulfated zirconia were successfully produced via a range of different preparation techniques. The model systems were investigated with various techniques, including thermal desorption, photoelectron, X-ray absorption and IR spectroscopies. Electrically and thermally conducting thin films of sulfated zirconia were prepared on oxidised silicon wafers, {{in order to allow}} the application of surface science techniques. Thermal treatment of the films was optimised to chemically mimic the powder process, resulting in films possessing the essential features (including tetragonal phase, nanocrystallinity and sulfur content of ~ 3 atomic %) of active powder catalysts. Two distinctly different chemisorption sites were detected on the sulfated zirconia thin films by both ammonia and n-butane adsorption studies. Strongly chemisorbed ammonia reacts with certain sulfate species leading to the evolution of SO 2 above 473 K. Low temperature (300 - 100 K) n-butane adsorption-desorption equilibrium isobaric measurements showed adsorption to be promoted over the sulfated zirconia thin films, as compared with oxidised silicon wafers. Strong and weak n-butane chemisorption, releasing heats of between 59 - 40 and 47 - 34 kJ/mol, corresponds to 5 and 25 % of a monolayer coverage, respectively. The total amount of chemisorbed n-butane coincides very well with the estimated number of surface sulfate groups. An increase in adsorption heat was observed between coverages of ~ 5 - 8 % of a monolayer, indicating adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. A bimolecular isomerisation mechanism is thus considered plausible under such coverages. Physisorption on the films generates heats of ~ 28 kJ/mol, for coverages from 30 % up to a complete monolayer. Multilayer adsorption results in the formation of an electrically insulating adsorbate structure. Carbonaceous deposits were detected on the films after exposure to n-butane under reactive conditions ( 481 K), thus proving the films have reactive centres. Analysis has shown the deposits to contain unsaturated hydrocarbons, which have a * resonance typical of butenes; furthermore, sulfate groups are reduced during exposure, thus proving the oxidative dehydrogenating ability of sulfated zirconia. The deposits are also shown to be oxygenated, thus are consistent with the <b>stabilised</b> <b>form</b> of the reactive carbocation intermediates. Powder sulfated zirconia catalysts were prepared from sulfating agents containing one and two pregrouped sulfur atoms, via a variety of different methods using various sulfur loadings, to test whether disulfate groups are responsible for the catalytic activity of the material. Sulfated zirconias synthesised from two pregrouped sulfur atoms were however found to be less active. Nevertheless, the presence of disulfate groups was found to be a prerequisite for catalytic activity and for materials prepared using the same sulfation method the more active were shown to have higher disulfate concentrations. It is thus proposed that the more strongly chemisorbing sites, which react with ammonia, correspond to a minority disulfate species. These disulfate sites may oxidatively dehydrogenate n-butane, initiating the formation of catalytically active isomerisation centres. The chemical environment of these disulfate groups is envisioned to strongly influence the catalytic reactivity of the active sites they generate...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{prostate}} {{cancer is the}} most common male cancer diagnosed in the United Kingdom. Our rudimentary knowledge of the aetiology and molecular pathways implicated in prostate tumourigenesis is probably responsible for its poor prognosis. To address this, a conditional transgenic approach was employed to investigate the role of the tumour suppressor Lkbl and the proto-oncogenes p-catenin and K-ras within the murine prostate. LKB 1 is a tumour suppressor commonly mutated in Peutz-Jegher's syndrome (PJS), which predominantly predisposes to gastrointestinal hamartomas and various extra intestinal tumours. Using a conditional transgenic approach, recombination of a LoxP-flanked Lkbl transgene was mediated by the inducible Ah (p 450 CYP 1 A 1) promoter. Loss of Lkbl in un-induced AhCreLkb mice predisposed to prostate intra-epithelial neoplasia (PIN) within 2 - 4 months. Molecular analysis revealed that neoplastic foci had lost cellular polarity and showed enhanced PI 3 K/AKT and Wnt signalling pathway activity, ultimately leading to tumour growth. Loss of Lkbl did not result in activation of the AMPK/mTOR pathway, suggesting that a feedback mechanism suppresses mTOR in Lkbl deficient conditions. Study of disease progression in this model is limited owing to decreased longevity, which is thought to be caused by the development of bulbourethral gland cysts. Additional GU tract phenotypes were also observed in un-induced AhCre+LkbPl/J 1 urethral glands and seminal vesicles and all Lkbl 1 male mice were infertile. To address the problem of reduced longevity in the AhCre+Lkbl cohort, PBCre+Lkbl transgenic mice were derived. Here, Oe-recombinase expression is mediated by the composite rat Probasin promoter. All cohorts showed life-spans comparable to wild-type mice at 500 days. PBCre+Lkbl+/ prostates were normal, while mice developed low grade-PIN, demonstrating the hypomorphic nature of the Lkbl floxed allele. PBCre+Lkblm mice demonstrated atypical hyperplasia of the prostate, arguing a critical role for Lkbl levels in cancer initiation. Long-term Lkbl deficiency also predisposed to kidney abnormalities, preputial gland squamous metaplasia and PJS-linked phenotypes, including stomach hamartomas and Sertoli-cell-only syndrome at 500 days. To investigate the deregulation of Wnt signalling in the murine prostate, conditional transgenic mice carrying a dominant stable form of p-catenin in the prostate were generated (PBCre+Catnb*/lox(ex 3)). At 3 months, males manifested PIN-like keratinised squamous metaplasia that advanced to adenocarcinoma by 6 months. No evidence for synergy was determined between Lkbl loss and activated P-catenin, although investigations were limited to PBCre*Lkbl*/Jl:Catnb*/lox(ex 3) mice owing to a time constraint and partial embryonic lethality of Lkblm mice. Synergism between Wnt and Ras signalling has been well documented in many human cancers, including intestine, liver and kidney. To address the cooperativity of these pathways in the prostate, the PBCre transgenic line was employed to express an activated K-rasV 12 mutation and a dominant <b>stabilised</b> <b>form</b> of p-catenin (PBCre+K- ras+/vl 2 Catnb+/lox(ex 3)). PBCre+K-ras+/v 12 mice were predisposed to low grade-PIN at 16 months and demonstrated elevated MAPK signalling. Double mutants demonstrated rapid tumourigenesis to invasive carcinoma at 6 months, which displayed elevated Wnt and MAPK signalling. Further molecular analysis determined that activated K-ras and P-catenin synergise to facilitate prostate tumourigenesis by elevating the number of androgen receptor positive cells and upregulating Wnt targets, such as COX- 2 and c-Myc. This evidence suggests androgen-independent tumour growth and presents a direct mechanism whereby tumour progression is accelerated via the canonical Wnt pathway. In summary, this thesis reports the first correlation between Lkbl loss and prostate neoplasia, and demonstrates synergy between Wnt and Ras signalling in murine prostate tumourigenesis. Together, these data provide a valuable resource for genetic based studies and establish the multi-step nature of tumourigenesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Commercial piggery {{operations}} produce substantial {{quantities of}} solid waste requiring further treatment and disposal. Screened piggery solids contain recyclable nutrients and pathogenic organisms. Point source contribution from piggeries to surface and ground water pollution can be minimised by the application of composting process and technology. This process can serve as the treatment component of an overall waste management plan of a commercial piggery to biologically convert the putrescible to a <b>stabilised</b> <b>form</b> free of pathogenic organisms. The rate of biochemical reaction determines {{the speed at which}} composting can proceed. Solids Retention Time (SRT) is {{the most important factor in}} determining the stability of the compost product. SRT is function of, among many other factors, the type of substrate and amendments and their corresponding reaction rate constants. In order to establish the minimum SRT, it is important to correctly derive the reaction rate constant from decomposition data. Rates of decomposition vary widely depending on the organic substrate. Although numerous guidelines are available for the design of effective composting plant, most of these guidelines or studies deal with sewage sludge or municipal solid waste. There is a complete lack of data on composting process design or reaction rates for piggery solids. Due to these specific concerns, the main objectives of this thesis were to examine the composting process in relation to bulking material and operating conditions; analyse the disappearance of Total Organic Carbon with temperature development in order to determine first order reaction rates; and to analyse the inactivation or decay of indicator pathogens in piggery solids and sawdust composting trials and experiments. Aerobic static pile composting of piggery solids was investigated at pilot (5 m 3) scale. Sawdust was used as the bulking agent to provide additional carbon and to increase the porosity of the substrate. Composting trials, using different substrate to bulking agent ratios and aeration frequencies were performed. The composting mixture was placed over an aerated base in the form of a pile. Temperature development, pH, Total Nitrogen. Total Phosphorus, Total Organic Carbon, Total Solids, Volatile Solids and pathogenic indicators were monitored until the completion of the trial. The development of temperature profiles in three layers of the pile in each trial was similar and in agreement with trials conducted by various researchers. The change in moisture levels at two sampling points within the compost heap for each trial were similar. The moisture removal results demonstrated that the moisture removal from the compost pile depends not only upon a suitable temperature range, but also on the mode of heat movement. The increase in Total Solids and decrease in the fraction of Volatile Solids during the composting period in many trials were in agreement with trends described by many authors and demonstrated the decomposition process. The nutrient analysis showed that up to 75 % of initial nitrogen was conserved in the compost while there was no significant change in phosphorus concentration. There was varying order of magnitude reduction in Streptococci numbers in different trials. Similar trends were observed for total coliform(MPN) reduction. The high temperatures of the pile for prolonged periods were expected to decrease the bacterial counts to levels lower than those observed. The high values of MPN indicate that there are certain spore formers which survive the composting process. The decomposition curve of Total Organic Carbon was used to calculate rate constant (k) over time from the temperature development data. A medium-order. Newton-Raphson algorithm, which solved non-stiff differential equation was used to solve the reaction rate equation numerically. Two models were compared for the determination of reaction rate constant. Values of reaction rate constant varied under different operating conditions of compost piles. The best values of reaction rate constant of the order of 0. 008 and 0. 007 per day were obtained from trial 4 that used a 25 : 75 (volume basis) sawdust-waste ratio; and was aerated for 10 minuted every hour. Same trial had the lowest Mean Residence Time (MRT) of approximately 115 days. Two controlled laboratory experiments at 70 °C and 60 °C, respectively were also performed to independently verify rate constants developed from pilot trials. Laboratory experiments gave similar reaction rate constants to those mentioned above. This is beside the fact that a constant temperature profile was maintained throughout the composting period in these two experiments. The average residence time of solids under controlled conditions was not very different from MRT values obtained in the same pilot trial. A comparison of two models showed that a simple first-order kinetic model can be used for the determination of inactivation coefficient, but using Arrhenius equation incorporating the reference temperature would provide a better thermal inactivation coefficient estimates. In trial 4, inactivation rate coefficient values were of the order of 0. 394 and 0. 380 per day at two sampling positions, respectively. The laboratory experiments provided inactivation rate coefficient values of the order of 61. 97 and 47. 34 per day, respectively. The significant difference in the reduction of indicator microorganisms between pilot trials and controlled experiments emphasises that homogeneity is critical in any composting process. It also emphasises the need for a temperature feedback aeration system...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{evidence}} suggesting that the dynamics of platelet aggregation are regulated by shear (rheology) dependent platelet aggregation mechanisms that operate alongside traditional soluble agonist dependent aggregation mechanisms. Rheology-dependent platelet aggregation requires the biomechanical adhesive and signalling function of GPIb and integrin αIIbβ 3, with the contribution of each receptor to the initiation of aggregation dependent on local hemodynamic conditions. In contrast, soluble agonists amplify and potentiate platelet activation and {{play a major role in}} <b>stabilising</b> <b>formed</b> aggregates. Unravelling the dynamics of platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in vivo therefore requires consideration of the co-operative interplay between soluble agonist and rheology-dependent platelet aggregation mechanisms. This thesis focuses on the role of hemodynamics (rheology) in platelet activation and aggregation. Chapter 3 describes the characterisation of the dynamic behaviour of platelet aggregation in vivo. In Chapter 4 it is established that platelet aggregation is greatly enhanced by acute changes in blood flow conditions. A novel rheology dependent platelet aggregation mechanism is identified that operates in the presence of shear microgradients. In chapter 5 I further characterise rheology dependent platelet aggregation and establish the relative role of soluble agonists in this process. Chapter 6 describes a novel and highly localised platelet morphological shape change that forms the basis of a mechano-sensory mechanism that allows platelets to respond to local hemodynamic conditions. This mechanism, involving membrane tether restructuring, increases the ability of discoid platelets to aggregate within low or decelerating shear zones in the blood flow...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} between ligands and the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{to which they}} bind {{has long been the}} focus of intensive investigation. The signalling cascades triggered by receptor activation, due in most cases to ligand binding, are of great physiological and medical importance; indeed, GPCRs are targeted by in excess of 30 % of small molecule therapeutic medicines. Attempts to identify further pharmacologically useful GPCR ligands, for receptors with known and unknown endogenous ligands, continue apace. In earlier days direct assessment of such interactions was restricted largely to the use of ligands incorporating radioactive isotope labels as this allowed detection of the ligand and monitoring its interaction with the GPCR. This use of such markers has continued with the development of ligands labelled with fluorophores and their application to the study of receptor–ligand interactions using both light microscopy and resonance energy transfer techniques, including homogenous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Details of ligand–receptor interactions via X-ray crystallography are advancing rapidly as methods suitable for routine production of substantial amounts and <b>stabilised</b> <b>forms</b> of GPCRs have been developed and there is hope that this may become as routine as the co-crystallisation of serine/threonine kinases with ligands, an approach that has facilitated widespread use of rapid structure-based ligand design. Conformational changes involved in the activation of GPCRs, widely predicted by biochemical and biophysical means, have inspired the development of intramolecular FRET-based sensor forms of GPCRs designed to investigate the events following ligand binding and resulting in a signal propagation across the cell membrane. Finally, a number of techniques are emerging in which ligand–GPCR binding can be studied in ways that, whilst indirect, are able to monitor its results in an unbiased and integrated manner.

The binding of {{divalent}} cations (particularly {{calcium and}} magnesium) to strains of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and their isolated proteins was investigated, using equilibrium dialysis and potentiometric titration, {{in an attempt}} to elucidate the role of divalent cations in virus stabilisation. It was found that dissociation of bound calcium ions from TMV is apparently a necessary but insufficient condition for in vitro virus disassembly. TMV and the closely related strain, Y-TAMV, possessed three groups per protein subunit which titrated near neutral pH and which showed significant metal ion binding. The tightest of the three calcium binding sites, which was absent on the RNA-free protein, had a computed pKH of 8. 3 and pKCa of 5. 2 and had a significantly higher affinity for Ca⁺² over Mg⁺² This group thus had some of the characteristics to be expected for a calcium-mediated switch controlling in vivo virus disassembly, and possibly controlled the in vitro alkaline degradation of TMV as well. Both the U 2 and cowpea strains of TMV bound one additional metal ion per protein subunit relative to vulgare, this binding site being retained by the polymerised proteins. However, calcium ions <b>stabilised</b> the polymerised <b>forms</b> of the proteins of all four TMV strains at pH values where depolymerisation would normally have occurred.

After some time, this new form of English, now loaded with substantial influences from Indian English, Baba, native Malay, and the southern varieties of Chinese, became the language of the streets and began to be learned as a first language in its own right. Creolization occurred, and Singlish is now a fully <b>formed,</b> <b>stabilised,</b> and independent English-based creole language.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} HGF/SF was {{examined}} on {{the interactions between}} APC, GSK 3 beta and beta-catenin in prostate cancer cells LNCapFGC (E-cadherin positive) and PC- 3 (E-cadherin negative). Using immunoprecipitation, APC {{was found to be}} co-precipitated with either GSK 3 beta or beta-catenin in both cell lines. Stimulation with HGF/SF showed no change in the co-precipitation status of these protein molecules. In contrast, co-precipitation between GSK 3 beta and beta-catenin was only observed in LNCapFGC cells, and increased upon continued exposure to the motogen HGF/SF. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence, stimulation with HGF/SF was found to increase the level of co-localised cytoplasmic staining between beta-catenin and GSK 3 beta, in prostate cancer cells. RT-PCR revealed that there were no mutations within the binding regions between beta-catenin and GSK 3 beta. It is concluded, that uncomplexed cytoplasmic pools of beta-catenin associate more readily with the Axin complex in the absence of E-cadherin. Whereas, in the presence of E-cadherin, beta-catenin is <b>stabilised</b> by <b>forming</b> tight cell-cell contacts which may influence the invasive potential of cancer cells...|$|R
40|$|A general {{overview}} is provided {{about the recent}} and {{state of the art}} advances in the field of metal ions, metal complexes and small aromatic molecules use as stabilising agents for non-canonical nucleotide forms (non-B duplex, triplexes, quadruplexes). Despite the broad topic, the collection and comparison of the large amount of data available enable some general remarks to be done. The ability of metal ions to <b>stabilise</b> a particular <b>form</b> is discussed on the basis of ion size, charge density, coordination and binding modes and/or dehydration energy. In the case of small molecules (intercalators and/or groove binders) charge, flexibility, hydrophobicity and/or geometry are considered...|$|R
50|$|ETFs are heterodimeric {{proteins}} {{composed of}} an alpha and beta subunit (ETFA and ETFB), and contain an FAD cofactor and AMP. ETF {{consists of three}} domains: domains I and II are formed by the N- and C-terminal portions of the alpha subunit, respectively, while domain III is formed by the beta subunit. Domains I and III share an almost identical alpha-beta-alpha sandwich fold, while domain II forms an alpha-beta-alpha sandwich {{similar to that of}} bacterial flavodoxins. FAD is bound in a cleft between domains II and III, while domain III binds the AMP molecule. Interactions between domains I and III <b>stabilise</b> the protein, <b>forming</b> a shallow bowl where domain II resides.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{predictive}} ability and consistency properties of exchange rate {{expectations for the}} dollar/euro using a survey conducted in Spain by PwC among {{a panel of experts}} and entrepreneurs. Our results suggest that the PwC panel have some forecasting ability for time horizons from 3 to 9 months, although only for the 3 -month ahead expectations we obtain marginal evidence of unbiasedness and efficiency in the forecasts. As for the consistency properties of the exchange rate expectations formation process, we find that survey participants <b>form</b> <b>stabilising</b> expectations in the short-run and destabilising expectations in the long- run and that the expectation formation process is closer to fundamentalists than chartists.

50|$|The glass {{transition}} temperature (Tg) of the polybutadiene blocks is typically -90 °C and Tg of the polystyrene blocks is +100 °C. So, at any temperature between about -90 °C and +100 °C Kraton SBS will act as a physically crosslinked elastomer. If Kraton polymers are heated substantially above the Tg of the styrene-derived blocks, that is, above about 100 °C, like 170 °C the physical cross-links change from rigid glassy regions to flowable melt regions and the entire material flows and therefore can be cast, molded, or extruded into any desired form. On cooling, this new form resumes its elastomeric character. This is the reason such a material is called a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). The polystyrene blocks form domains of nanometre size in the microstructure, and they <b>stabilise</b> the <b>form</b> of the moulded material. Depending on the rubber to polystyrene ratio in the material, the polystyrene domains can be spherical or form cylinders or lamellae. The hydrogenated Kraton polymers named Kraton G exhibit improved resistance to temperature (processing at 200 - 230 °C is common), to oxidation and to UV. SEBS and SEPS due to their polyolefinic rubber nature present excellent compatibility with polyolefins and paraffinic oils.|$|R
50|$|Form Change also {{provides}} {{an outlet for}} the aspirations of fanatics and niche social groups. Multiple colonies have been established on asteroids and cometary debris throughout the solar system, in which isolated groups implement quixotic and highly questionable form changes to bring about their own personal utopias. One such group magnifies the scale of their body so as to allow for greater brain development in the womb. Another group has established a surprisingly stable fiefdom in which physical appearance is a direct indicator of societal status. Others attempt bizarre cyborg enhancements, <b>stabilised</b> by regular <b>form</b> change tank visitations. One of the most extreme forms is reminiscent of a kangaroo with highly adapted circulatory and respiratory systems, allowing survival {{on the surface of}} Mars.|$|R
50|$|Attention {{should be}} drawn {{at the outset}} to certain {{fundamental}} definitions and principles of the science. The original characters of an alphabet are modified by the material and the implements used. When stone and chisel are discarded for papyrus and reed-pen, the hand encounters less resistance and moves more rapidly. This leads {{to changes in the}} size and position of the letters, and then to the joining of letters, and, consequently, to altered shapes. We are thus confronted at an early date with quite distinct types. The majuscule style of writing, based on two parallel lines, ADPL, is opposed to the minuscule, based on a system of four lines, with letters of unequal height, adpl. Another classification, according to the care taken in forming the letters, distinguishes between the set book-hand and the cursive script. The difference in this case is determined by {{the subject matter of the}} text; the writing used for books (scriptura libraria) is in all periods quite distinct from that used for letters and documents (epistolaris, diplomatica). While the set book-hand, in majuscule or minuscule, shows a tendency to <b>stabilise</b> the <b>forms</b> of the letters, the cursive, often carelessly written, is continually changing in the course of years and according to the preferences of the writers.|$|R
40|$|Extract from ungerminated bean seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Saxa) was {{fractionated}} by {{gel chromatography}} on Sephacryl S- 200 and by anion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl- Sephacel. Aminopeptidase activities were measured {{with the following}} amino acid-p-nitroanilides: phenylalanine, leucine, methionine, proline, alanine, lysine, arginine and glycine. Four forms differing in their substrate specificities were identified: form 1 (liberating alanine, lysine and arginine), form 2 (liberating leucine, methionine, phenylalanine and perhaps also proline), form 3 (liberating glycine) and form 4 (liberating phenylalanine). Form 1 was highly sensitive to 1, 10 -phenanthroline, while the same concentration of this chelator caused no major effects on the other forms. All aminopeptidases were relatively stable at pH 5. 5 in extracts from ungerminated seeds, but the inactivation was accelerated {{by the addition of}} cotyledon extract from 8 -day-old seedlings. Under such conditions form 3 was most rapidly inactivated followed by forms 1 and 2, while form 4 was less susceptible. The inactivation of the various forms was affected differently by high concentrations of free amino acids. L-Arginine accelerated the inactivation of <b>form</b> 2 and <b>stabilised</b> simultaneously <b>form</b> 3. All forms were protected by L-alanine. Forms 1, 2 and 4 were stabilised by L-serine and by L-proline. Glycine delayed the inactivation of forms 2, 3 and 4...|$|R
40|$|Urea, {{ammonium}} and nitrate are {{the most}} important nitrogen forms employed in agricultural plant production. Although nitrate has been shown to act as a signal for metabolism and plant development in physiological studies, so far no use is made of the signalling effect of different N forms in cereal plant production. To investigate the effect of different N forms on shoot development, we performed nutrient solution experiments with spring barley and observed that shoot biomass production and in particular tillering decreased with an increased amount of nitrogen being supplied in the form of urea. We determined cytokinin translocation rates in the xylem under varied nitrogen nutrition or after supply of exogenous cytokinins in the presence of different nitrogen forms and found that different nitrogen forms strongly affected cytokinin translocation from roots to shoots. To reproduce this nitrogen form-dependent effect in field trials, winter wheat was fertilised with <b>stabilised</b> N <b>forms</b> in the starter dressing. In fact, the supply of different nitrogen forms allowed to reproduce the effects observed in hydroponic culture. In dependence of seasonal variations this change in plant architecture also affected grain yield. Our results show that the signalling effect of stabilized nitrogen forms can be used to influence tiller number and yield components in wheat and barley...|$|R
40|$|The deglacial {{history and}} {{oceanography}} of Uummannaq Trough, central West Greenland continental shelf, was investigated using foraminiferal, sedimentological, and bathymetric records {{together with a}} radiocarbon chronology, providing a timeline for the retreat of glacial ice after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). To map ice stream retreat, {{data were collected from}} cores from the outer (JR 175 -VC 45 and JR 175 -VC 43) and inner (JR 175 -VC 42) Uummannaq Trough. A large ice stream, fed by confluent glaciers draining the interior of the Greenland Ice Sheet, extended across the outer shelf during the LGM and was in retreat by 15. 0 cal kyr BP. Foraminiferal data indicate that the ‘warm’ West Greenland Current (WGC) was established prior to 14. 0 cal kyr BP, which is the hitherto earliest record of Atlantic Water found on the West Greenland shelf. For each of the cores, foraminifera indicate that ice sheet retreat was followed quickly by incursion of the WGC, suggesting that the warm water may have enhanced ice retreat. Prior to the Younger Dryas cold event, the radiocarbon chronology indicates that the ice sheet retreated to the mid-shelf, where it subsequently <b>stabilised</b> and <b>formed</b> a large grounding-zone wedge (GZW). After the Younger Dryas, around 11. 5 cal kyr BP, the ice retreated rapidly from the GZW and into the fjords...|$|R
