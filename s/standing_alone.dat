5|$|Onion domes {{often appear}} {{in groups of}} three, {{representing}} the Holy Trinity, or five, representing Jesus Christ and the Four Evangelists. Domes <b>standing</b> <b>alone</b> represent Jesus. Vasily Tatischev, the first to record such interpretation, disapproved of it emphatically. He believed that the five-domed design of churches was propagated by Patriarch Nikon, who liked to compare the central and highest dome with himself and four lateral domes with four other patriarchs of the Orthodox world. There is no other evidence that Nikon ever held such a view.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene when}} Walter {{approaches}} Gus' house {{with plans to}} kill him ends with an extremely high crane shot of Walter <b>standing</b> <b>alone</b> {{in the middle of}} the street. MacLaren wanted that shot to be extremely effective because she believed it conveyed Walter's helplessness, insignificance and lack of experience. Although the normal crane used for such overhead shots in Breaking Bad was only 30 feet tall, MacLaren rented a 180-foot-tall crane specifically for that shot. Since the crew had only about four hours to shoot before losing the night-time hours, the crane shot was the first one they filmed. It was shot by camera operators Andrew Voegeli, with dolly grip David Jaxx Nagro and gaffer Steven Litecky. Later, for the scene when Walter meets with Mike at a bar, MacLaren backlit Walter as he entered so only his silhouette would be visible when he entered. When the shots of Mike punching Walter was originally filmed, the staging involved Mike standing up, then Walter standing up, then Mike suddenly punching him. Vince Gilligan edited the scene to have Mike simply punch Walter instead to make the action faster and more surprising. The scene was arranged by stunt coordinator Al Goto, and actors Bryan Cranston and Jonathan Banks performed the stunts themselves. Mike kicks Walter several times after he falls, and Goto placed a large sandbag against Cranston's torso for Banks to kick during those scenes.|$|E

5|$|The squash {{house was}} {{constructed}} around 1920, completed in 1931, and was demolished between 2011 and 2013. It was {{located near the}} Logan Riding Ring, on the club's south entrance road. It was two stories high, five bays wide and nine bays deep, and was stucco-covered with a flat roof. There were two entrances on the main (south) facade, one at ground level and another on the balcony. The entrances had double wooden doors, paneled below and glazed above. All of the building's windows consisted of wood-framed, paired casement windows with brick sills. A veranda with Tuscan piers extended {{the length of the}} main facade, interrupted by a two-bay-wide, one-bay-deep projection east of the main entrance. The building's interior contained a doubles court, two singles courts, a reception room, locker rooms, showers, and a spectators' gallery seating 150. Across the road from where the building stood is an outdoor riding ring enclosed by a rough rail fence. To the west of the building's site, <b>standing</b> <b>alone</b> in the tall grass, is a 16th-century post-and-lintel stone element, which {{was at the center of}} the stage of a 1,500-seat outdoor Greek amphitheater that was part of the Shepard estate and was since dismantled.|$|E

25|$|This {{rejected}} the Aguilar–Spinelli test {{and put in}} place a totality-of-the-circumstances standard. This was put into place because the court recognized that there was more evidence that the Gateses were involved in drug trafficking than just the letter <b>standing</b> <b>alone.</b> The court agreed that if the letter had just stood alone it would not be probable cause to get a warrant. The court also recognized that under the Aguilar–Spinelli two-pronged test, it would be very hard for the “reliability” prong to ever be satisfied from an anonymous tip so it therefore should be abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Not every unfair act {{amounts to}} an unfair labor practice; as an example, failing to pay an {{individual}} worker overtime pay for hours worked in excess of forty hours in a week might {{be a violation of}} the Fair Labor Standards Act, but it is unlikely to amount to an unfair labor practice as well. Similarly, a violation of a collective bargaining agreement, <b>standing</b> <b>alone,</b> may not constitute an unfair labor practice unless the employer has not only violated the contract but repudiated all or part of it.|$|E

25|$|Eight Bells was the {{outgrowth}} {{of a series}} of oil paintings that Homer made using three wooden panels he found in the cabin of his brother's sloop at Prouts Neck, Maine. On two of the panels Homer painted scenes of mackerel fleets at Prouts Neck, one at dawn and the other at sunset; on the third he painted a grisaille study of the work that inspired Eight Bells, which depicted a ship's officer <b>standing</b> <b>alone,</b> taking an observation with an octant. Several years earlier, Homer had painted a watercolor on his voyage to England that also showed a sailor performing this activity.|$|E
25|$|J.P. was a complex, {{intelligent}} and highly creative individual, {{as well as}} a devoted family man, an artist and an accomplished musician, and was well known for his fondness for collecting things. Anything and everything, wherever he went, he collected stuff. His obsession with collecting sprang from his belief that all objects were art, all objects have beauty and were worthy of <b>standing</b> <b>alone</b> as art or of disassembling and re-working to enhance the art inherent within. He had been inspired and influenced by his beatnik artist friends, and by the revolution in the art world earlier last century that produced the Dada/Anti-Art movement and the found-art philosophy of Marcel Duchamp.|$|E
25|$|Often the bergfried {{forms the}} main tower in {{the centre of}} the castle or is {{positioned}} as a wall tower on the main avenue of attack against the castle (especially in the case of spur castles). Ir may be an isolated structure <b>standing</b> <b>alone</b> amongst the other buildings of the castle or be joined to them to form a combined building complex. However, typically, the bergfried is a self-contained element that is not internally connected to other buildings and has its own access. As a rule, this is a so-called elevated entrance, i.e. the entrance is located at the level of an upper floor of the tower and is accessed via its own bridge, staircase or ladder.|$|E

25|$|It is {{only now}} that Inigo Jones may have taken a firmer grip on his {{original}} ideas. Seeing De Caus' completed wing <b>standing</b> <b>alone</b> as an entirety, it was considered too plain – De Caus' original plan was for the huge facade to have a low pitched roof, with wings finishing with no architectural symbols of termination. The modifications to the completed wing were of a balustrade hiding the weak roof line and Italianate, pavilion-like towers at each end. The focal point became not a portico but the large double height Venetian window. This south front (illustration above), has been deemed an architectural triumph of Palladian architecture in Britain, and {{it is widely believed}} that the final modifications to the work of De Caus were by Inigo Jones himself.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the death of his grandfather, Nilsen became more quiet and reserved, often <b>standing</b> <b>alone</b> at the harbour watching the herring boats, on which his grandfather had fished, sail by. At home, he seldom participated in family activities and would actively repel any attempts by adult family members to demonstrate any affection towards him. Nilsen also grew to resent what he saw as the unfair amount of attention his mother, grandmother and later, stepfather would show towards his older brother and, to a lesser degree, his younger sister. In spite of Nilsen's increasing bitterness towards his brother, he envied Olav's popularity. Nonetheless, when not opting to partake in solo activities, he would often talk to or play games with his younger sister, Sylvia, with whom he was closer than any other family member.|$|E
25|$|In ritual fashion, the Indians scalped, stripped, and {{mutilated}} the soldiers' bodies before leaving. In {{his report}} to his superiors, Carrington listed what was discovered at the battlefield the next day: eyes torn out and laid on rocks, noses and ears cut off, teeth chopped out, brains taken out {{and placed on}} rocks, hands and feet cut off, private parts severed. The two civilians, Wheatley and Fisher, had had their faces smashed into bloody pulp, and Wheatley had been pierced {{by more than a}} hundred arrows. The last trooper to die in the battle may have been Adolph Metzger, a bugler who used his instrument as a weapon until it was battered shapeless. Metzger was the only soldier whose dead body was not mutilated. The Indians covered him with a buffalo hide. Some historians interpreted that as a tribute to his bravery in <b>standing</b> <b>alone</b> against several armed enemies.|$|E
