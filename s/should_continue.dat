The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English {{because that was the}} language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|Augustus {{bestowed}} only {{properties and}} possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With {{regards to the}} Principate, {{it was obvious to}} Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> to obey Agrippa.|$|E

Bart decides to stop performing, but Marge convinces him that he <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> because he makes people happy. Bart arrives at Krusty's show and enthusiastically delivers his line, but the audience is bored with the line and does not react. With fans no longer interested in Bart, Krusty ditches him.|$|E

They intended to develop a game series based on Andrzej Sapkowski's Wiedźmin books (which were popular in Poland) and the author accepted the company's development proposal. The franchise rights had been sold to a Polish mobile game studio, but the studio had not worked on anything related to the franchise and CD Projekt acquired the rights to the Wiedźmin franchise. According to Iwiński, he and Kiciński {{had no idea how to}} develop a video game at that time.|$|E

By February 1983, consulting engineers Mott Hay and Anderson had submitted a recommendation to complete the M3 through Twyford Down. Following the completion of the motorway to Bar End in the summer of 1985, the junction at Hockley was the only set of traffic lights between London and Southampton.|$|E

News of this met with an icy reception from Major General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. In later life, when interviewed in the Oscar-nominated documentary The Day After Trinity (1980), Wilson would say that he should have strongly considered ceasing work on the bomb after the surrender of Germany, and regretted not doing so to some extent.|$|E

They watch filmed testimony of Berton describing a four-meter-tall child on Solaris, only to have this sighting dismissed as a hallucination {{by a panel of}} scientists. After burning his personal mementos, Kelvin departs Earth to meet the Solaris scientists who have made reports that are equally confusing.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Washington's {{orders were}} delivered, a British raiding party under George Collier and Edward Mathew arrived in Virginia to capture or destroy {{supplies}} {{that might otherwise}} be sent southward to aid the reinforcements going to South Carolina. Scott's orders changed again; the Virginia House of Delegates ordered him to immediately prepare defenses against Collier and Mathew's raids. When it became clear to both the legislature and Washington that Collier and Mathew intended only to raid supplies, not to invade, they concluded that the local militia would be able to sufficiently protect Virginia's interests and that Scott <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> to recruit men to reinforce the south. The legislators presented him with a horse, a firearm, and 500 pounds sterling for his quick response to the threat.|$|E
