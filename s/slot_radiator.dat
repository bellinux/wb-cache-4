40|$|Abstract — The goal of {{this paper}} is to design a compact, planar UHF antenna {{operating}} over the frequency range 420 - 450 MHz. A microstrip patch antenna is selected as the elementary radiating structure because it has a low profile and is simple to fabricate. Compact size and enhanced bandwidth are simultaneously achieved through the use of a Reactive Impedance Surface (RIS) in place of a PEC ground plane. The inherently limited bandwidth of the patch is overcome by incorporating a U-shape resonant <b>slot</b> <b>radiator</b> within the patch area.

40|$|The {{demand for}} ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas {{have been on}} the rise in the last decade. There are many {{different}} systems and devices such as ground penetrating radars (GPRs) and wireless communications where such antennas find very unique applications. Many topologies and configurations have been studied and reported in designing UWB antennas. These topologies are corresponding to radiation pattern, polarization, and band of operation. In addition, in low frequencies, the size of the antenna becomes a major factor that must be taken into consideration. A portion of this thesis focuses on the design of novel UWB antennas. A new approach in design of a cavity-backed coupled sectorial loop antenna (CB-CSLA) with directional radiation pattern is presented. This antenna is backed by a short cylindrical cavity with a special modal suppressing septum to accomplish a unidirectional radiation pattern while maintaining a very wide bandwidth. Another approach, more applicable to ground penetrating radars, based on dielectric loaded multi-resonant slot antenna is also presented. Unidirectional radiation is achieved by a symmetrically loading the <b>slot</b> <b>radiators.</b> Since the <b>slot</b> length is reduced, radiation is preferentially aimed towards the dielectric superstrate. By gradually changing the index of refraction, the radiation from the dielectric back to the surrounding medium is facilitated. A prototype with dimension of 0. 28 λ by 0. 2 λ by 0. 07 λ is fabricated and shown to have a bandwidth of 35. 5 % and a front to back ratio of 12 dB.

40|$|The basic cube {{satellite}} (CubeSat) is {{a modern}} small satellite that has a standard size of about one liter (the 1 U CubeSat). Three 1 U CubeSats could be stacked to form a 3 U CubeSat. Their low-cost, short development time, and ease of deployment make CubeSats popular for space research, geographical information gathering, and communication applications. An antenna is {{a key part of}} the CubeSat communication subsystem. Traditionally, antennas used on CubeSats are wrapped-up wire dipole antennas, which are deployed after satellite launch. Another antenna type used on CubeSats is the patch antenna. In addition to their low gain and efficiency, deployable dipole antennas may also fail to deploy on satellite launch. On the other hand, a solid patch antenna will compete for space with solar cells when placed on a CubeSat face, interfering with satellite power generation. Slot antennas are promising alternatives to dipole and patch antennas on CubeSats. When excited, a thin slot aperture etched on a conductive sheet (ground plane) is an efficient bidirectional <b>radiator.</b> This open <b>slot</b> antenna can be backed by a reflector or cavity for unidirectional radiation, and solar cells can be placed in spaces on the ground plane not occupied by the slot. The large surface areas of 3 U CubeSats can be exploited for a multifunctional antenna by integrating multiple thin <b>slot</b> <b>radiators,</b> which are backed by a thin cavity on the CubeSat surfaces. Solar cells can then be integrated on the antenna surface. Polarization diversity and frequency diversity improve the overall performance of a communication system. Having a single radiating structure that could provide these diversities is desired. It has been demonstrated that when a probe excites a square cavity with two unequal length crossed-slots, the differential radiation from the two slots combines in the far-field to yield circular polarization. In addition, it has been shown that two equal-length proximal slots, when both fed with a stripline, resonate at a frequency due to their original lengths, and also resonate at a lower frequency due to mutual coupling between the slots, leading to a dual-band operation. The multifunctional antenna designs presented are harmonizations and extensions of these two independent works. In the multifunctional antenna designs presented, multiple slots were etched on a 83 mm x 340 mm two-layer shallow cavity. The slots were laid out on the cavity such when the cavity was excited by a probe at a particular point, the differential radiation from the slots would combine in the far-field to yield Left-Handed Circular Polarization (LHCP). Furthermore, when the cavity was excited by another probe at an opposite point, the slots would produce Right-Handed Circular Polarization (RHCP). In addition, as forethought, these slots were laid out on the cavity such that some slots were close together enough to give Linearly Polarized (LP) dual-band operation when fed with a stripline.

Leyland's design for the Midland Red order was not a slavish copy of the BMMO design but had clear family resemblance, notably having a rounded void {{at the top of the}} twelve vertically oriented ventilation <b>slots</b> for the <b>radiator</b> which gave space for the BMMO monogram. These were to be the only PD2/12s to be built with this new front, and also the only Leyland-bodied Titans fitted from new with such a feature.|$|R
40|$|Ultra-wideband (UWB) {{is one of}} {{the recent}} topics that {{received}} a great concern from academia and industry. However, UWB found many difficulties to be standardized due to the overlay working that made UWB an important potential interference source to many licensed and unlicensed spectrum throughout the band 3. 1 -to- 10. 6 GHz. This make many industries worried about deploying and standardizing this promising technology. Many techniques have been introduced by academia a friendly UWB design that can mitigate interference. One of these technologies recently proposed is band-notched technique. In this paper we propose a compact ultra-wideband microstrip antenna with triple bandnotched 5. 32 GHz, 8. 45 GHz and 10. 83 GHz. The proposed antenna consists of a rectangular patch with a partial ground plane that is fed by 50 Ω microstrip line. A band-stop function is created by inserting overlapped two u-shape <b>slots</b> on the <b>radiator</b> patch, added additional patch to ground plane side and slitin truncate ground plane. The proposed antenna is simulated in both the frequency domain and time domain. The achieved results show that the antenna performance has good impedance matching and stably performs omni-directional pattern in (x, z) plane over a bandwidth of 3. 1 to 10. 6 GHz. The proposed antenna could potentially minimize frequency interference from many underlying technologies i. e. WLAN, WiMAX and Aeronautical mobile bands...|$|R

40|$|Printed dipole {{elements}} and their complement, linear <b>slots,</b> are elementary <b>radiators</b> that have found use in low-profile antenna arrays. Low-profile antenna arrays, {{in addition to}} their small size and low weight characteristics, offer the potential advantage of low-cost, high-volume production with easy integration with active integrated circuit components. The design of such arrays requires that the radiation and impedance characteristics of the radiating elements be known. The FDTD (Finite-Difference Time-Domain) method is a general, straight-forward implementation of Maxwell's equations and offers a relatively simple way of analyzing both printed dipole and slot elements. Investigated in this work is the application of the FDTD method to the analysis of printed dipole and slot elements transversely coupled to an infinite transmission line in a multilayered configuration. Such dipole and slot elements may be used in dipole and slot series-fed-type linear arrays, where element offsets and interelement line lengths are used to obtain the desired amplitude distribution and beam direction, respectively. The design of such arrays is achieved using transmission line theory with equivalent circuit models for the radiating elements. In an equivalent circuit model, the dipole represents a shunt impedance to the transmission line, where the impedance is a function of dipole offset, length, and width. Similarly, the slot represents a series impedance to the transmission line. The FDTD method is applied to single dipole and slot elements transversely coupled to an infinite microstrip line using a fixed rectangular grid with Mur's second order absorbing boundary conditions. Frequency-dependent circuit and scattering parameters are obtained by saving desired time-domain quantities and using the Fourier transform. A Gaussian pulse excitation is applied to the microstrip transmission line, where the resulting reflected signal due to the presence of the radiating element is used to determine the equivalent element impedance...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{wireless}} communication systems call for ultra wideband operations {{to meet the}} continuous {{growth in the number}} of users of these systems. Since antenna is an integral part of any {{wireless communication}} system (transmitter or receiver), designing antennas with good gain over large bandwidth needs to be considered first. To meet the popular demand, wireless communication systems should be as cheap as possible which require antennas with small size, light weight, low profile and low cost, and that are easy to fabricate and assemble. A type of antenna that satisfies most of these requirements is the microstrip antenna. Most of the wideband techniques for microstrip antennas utilize complicated geometries such as stacked multiple metal/dielectric layers, complicated feed arrangements etc., which elude the primary attraction of microstrip antennas. On the other hand, single layer suspended configurations are considered the best choice as these are simple to fabricate and assemble. The objective of this research is to investigate simple microstrip antennas with large bandwidth. A single layer suspended microstrip configuration was chosen for the purpose. In the first part of the research, the bandwidth was increased to about 50 % with linear phase characteristics by optimizing the feed configurations while retaining the overall simplicity. This study has resulted in proposing a criterion for obtaining maximum bandwidth in the suspended microstrip configuration. An analytical model has been developed for such an antenna configuration. Although several analytical tools are available for the microstrip antenna analysis, equivalent circuit based approach proves to be a simple one and offers convincingly accurate results. Another advantage of the proposed equivalent circuit modeling scheme is that it is suitable for computer aided design (CAD). In order to make this approach even more useful, the antenna designed in the first part was modified to meet desired specifications such as reduction in the air gap to make the antenna compact, symmetrical patterns, making antenna circularly polarized (LHCP or RHCP) without changing the feed configuration. Nearly symmetrical patterns were obtained throughout the band of operation by modifying the profile of patch close to the feed strip. Circular polarization (CP) operation has been obtained from the basic antenna by cutting a diagonal <b>slot</b> on the <b>radiator</b> patch. Here the slot orientation decides the type of CP i. e., LHCP or RHCP. In this work obtained of 7. 1 % axial ratio (3 dB) bandwidth with other characteristics unaffected. The overall height of the antenna is reduced by 55 % by cutting a slot and re-optimizing the feed strip dimensions. These studies emphasize flexibility offered by the design approach in realizing practical antennas for various applications...|$|R
