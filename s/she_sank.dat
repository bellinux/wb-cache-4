5|$|U-40 {{conducted}} two war patrols {{during her}} career. Both {{of which were}} part of the 6th U-boat Flotilla. During her short time in the war, <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> no ships.|$|E
5|$|Under her new captain, U-43 left Lorient on 10 November 1940 and {{returned}} to the waters west of Ireland, where <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> three more merchant ships and damaged a fourth.|$|E

5|$|After this {{enforced}} absence U-43 {{began her}} next patrol on 11 May 1941, {{still under the}} command of Wolfgang Lüth, who had been promoted to Kapitänleutnant on 1 January. Once again she sailed out into the mid-Atlantic, where <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> three ships.|$|E
5|$|The North Carolina burned on January 29, 1859, when a {{fire started}} in a {{passenger}} stateroom. <b>She</b> <b>sank</b> {{the following day}} {{with the loss of}} two lives. The following month, the line acquired the Adelaide to replace the lost steamer.|$|E
5|$|U-38 {{left the}} port of Wilhelmshaven on 19 August 1939. The boat {{operated}} {{off the coast of}} Lisbon, returning to port on 18 September. During this four-week period, <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> two ships.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Once, twice, thrice!' cried Lucilla. 'Catch her, Honor, before <b>she</b> <b>sinks</b> {{into the}} river in disgust with this treacherous world.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not so, O Quilla. Out {{of the sea}} {{does the}} moon rise and, her course run, into the sea's white arms <b>she</b> <b>sinks</b> to sleep at last." ...|$|R
5|$|U-47 {{carried out}} ten combat patrols {{and spent a}} total of 238 days at sea. <b>She</b> <b>sank</b> 31 enemy ships (totalling 164,953 tons) and damaged eight more. Prior to her {{disappearance}} in March 1941, U-47 lost one crewman, Heinrich Mantyk, who fell overboard on 5 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|Early on 12 April, {{with the}} other three {{monitors}} having been scuttled the night before, Drava was attacked by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 flying from Arad, Romania. The anti-aircraft gunners on the ship claimed three enemy aircraft, and nine of the Stukas scored hits on her, most of which had little effect. However, the last bomb dropped straight down her funnel and exploded in her engine room, killing 54 of the crew. Only 13 survived, and <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> off Čib. Having ordered the burning of codes before <b>she</b> <b>sank,</b> Berić and his first officers were among the dead, {{but two of the}} successful anti-aircraft gunners, Rade Milojević and Miroslav Šurdilović, survived. During their occupation of parts of Yugoslavia, Drava was raised and then scrapped by Hungary. Berić was posthumously awarded the Order of Karađorđe's Star for his sacrifice. In April 2015, a bust of Berić was unveiled at the village of Belegiš, near Stara Pazova. The barracks of the Serbian River Flotilla in Novi Sad are also named after him.|$|E
5|$|El Sol {{returned}} to the Morgan Line in 1919 and sailed with them until March 1927, when <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> in New York Harbor after colliding with Sac City of the American Diamond Line. A portion of the ship's cargo was salvaged but the ship was scrapped later in the year.|$|E

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sinks</b> {{again into}} the chair, and again he withdraws. And [...] once more she gives him that soft eager look, and once more [...] averts it as he turns to her.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the sinking}} of U-162, the {{surviving}} crew members were {{picked up by the}} three destroyers and sent to the United States where they gave US interrogators information about U-162s history, including where and when she was laid down, how many ships <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> and details about her home port and the design and layout of submarines that were in her class.|$|E
5|$|Her first patrol centred {{around the}} west coast of Burma and the Andaman Islands before heading onto Fremantle, Australia, and was uneventful. She {{departed}} Australia for her second patrol on 6 May with orders to patrol the Flores Sea. On 15 May, <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> a Japanese coaster of around 100 tons with gunfire near Dompo Bay, Sumbawa. The following day <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> another Japanese coaster with gunfire, this time around 200 tons, in Sepeh harbour. On 1 June, she approached and sank the Japanese merchant cargo ship Tobi Maru near Matasiri, one of the Laut Kecil Islands. Tiptoe was damaged during the attack as the cargo ship was about to rendezvous with an escort. The escort launched thirteen depth charges, putting all of Tiptoes torpedo tubes out of action and flooded her sonar equipment. She returned to Fremantle on 17 June, and remained there undergoing repairs until 16 July when she left on her third patrol in the Sunda Strait along with her sister HMS Trump.|$|E
5|$|In March 1916, Kapitänleutnant Hans Nieland {{replaced}} von Rosenberg-Grusczyski as {{the captain}} of U-67, and it was under his command that U-67 was most successful, sinking 18 ships with a combined a total of , while damaging a further three of 14,766 tons. U-67s most successful month was April 1917, when <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> four ships of 15,223 tons in a span of twelve days.|$|E

6000|$|Hark, {{does it not}} thunder? no, 'tis the guns' roar, The {{neighbouring}} billows are turn'd into gore; Now {{each man}} must resolve to die, For here the coward cannot fly. Drums and trumpets toll the knell, And culverins the passing bell. Now, now they grapple, and now board amain; Blow up the hatches, they're off all again: Give them a broadside, the dice run at all, Down comes the mast and yard, and tacklings fall; She grows giddy now, like blind Fortune's wheel, <b>She</b> <b>sinks</b> there, <b>she</b> <b>sinks,</b> <b>she</b> turns up her keel. Who ever beheld so noble a sight, As this so brave, so bloody sea-fight! ...|$|R

5|$|Leaving Lorient for {{the final}} time on 27 February 1941, U-37s last patrol {{took her to the}} waters south of Iceland. There <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> two vessels, the Greek cargo ship Mentor on 7 March, and the Icelandic trawler Pétursey on the 12th. After {{spending}} 24 days at sea, U-37 entered the port of Kiel on 22 March.|$|E
5|$|Partially rearmed, Sagami was {{reclassified}} by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) as {{a coastal}} defense ship in 1912. In 1916, the Japanese sold {{her to the}} Russians, their allies {{since the beginning of}} World War I. En route to the White Sea in early 1917, <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> off Port Said, Egypt, after striking mines laid by a German submarine.|$|E
5|$|She {{was placed}} in reserve {{after the end of}} the war and sold in 1874. Her new owners {{converted}} Chickasaw into a train ferry in 1881 and renamed her Gouldsboro. The ship was later converted into a barge and remained in use until <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> sometime during the 1950s. Her wreck was discovered in the Mississippi River in New Orleans in 2003, although there are no plans to raise her.|$|E
60|$|Her glassy eyes {{suddenly}} soften--then close. A long shudder {{runs through}} her. A faint flush shows {{itself on the}} deadly pallor of her face, and fades again. Her limbs fail her. <b>She</b> <b>sinks</b> into Mrs. Crayford's arms.|$|R
6000|$|... (With a {{piercing}} epileptic cry <b>she</b> <b>sinks</b> on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet: then lies, shamming dead, with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon {{the ground in}} the attitude of most excellent master.) ...|$|R

5|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of the}} wreck of Titanic present a {{striking}} contrast. Although fourteen survivors testified that the ship had broken apart as <b>she</b> <b>sank,</b> this testimony was discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed that the ship had sunk intact. It {{is now clear that}} the stresses on Titanic caused the ship to split apart between the second and third funnels at or just below the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreck of}} HMS Campania was {{initially}} afforded {{protection under the}} Protection of Wrecks Act, being designated in 2000. This designation was revoked in 2013 when the site was re-designated as a Historic Marine Protected Area under the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010. The remains of the four Campania aircraft and seven 1½ Strutters that she had on board when <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> are still entombed in her wreck.|$|E
5|$|U-38 {{conducted}} eleven patrols, as part {{of several}} flotillas. During her career, <b>she</b> <b>sank</b> over 30 enemy vessels and damaged a further one. U-38 {{ranks as one of}} the most successful U-boats in World War II. She was scuttled west of Wesermünde (modern Bremerhaven) on 5 May 1945. Throughout the war, the U-Boat suffered no losses among her crew.|$|E
