40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the question of}} organizational scale and scope, with applications to various industries, including financial services. We build a model in which new opportunities arise for firms, but the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> to exploit them effectively are unknown. Early investments in these new opportunities expand scope and allow firms to learn the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> to make more efficient production decisions later on. The value of scope expansion is thus increasing in the strategic uncertainty about the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> for future success in exploiting new opportunities. The disadvantage of early scope expansion is that it requires irreversible investments before actual demand is known. This demand uncertainty means potential losses since the investment cannot be recovered when demand does not materialize. Thus, early entry into a new activity involves a tradeoff, and this tradeoff works in favor of early entry under two conditions. First, theremustbesufficiently high strategic uncertainty about the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> for success in th...|$|R

Having a style which is {{slightly}} less rough than that of other quartets, exemplary researchers in their heritage, impeccable executors with exceptional vocal quality, adorable people, they have reached a level of excellence and of admiration which is without equal in Sardinia and in the whole world. Their frequent performances on so many national television programs are to be remembered. In {{the last few years}} they've been touring extensively Europe (France, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Czech Republic, Spain, Belgium, Nederland, Austria, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Swiss, Ireland, Croatia, Serbia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Tunisia, Hungary, United Arab Emirates, Brazil and Japan). It is also remarkable their participation in 2001 to the Christmas Concert in the Vatican for the Pope John Paul II, the concert on May 2009 in the Concertgebouw Theater in Amsterdam and in December in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.The Tenores di Bitti “Mialinu Pira”, having performed for so many years, is nowadays considered from music-fans and etno-musicologists the most prominent example of this vocal art. There are many points that make them so special : the cantu a tenore is still well alive in Sardinia performed by many groups, most of them are old singers performing traditional texts. Their young age is a first approach to notice how their sound, harsh and ancestral, is in fact very homogeneous. Their perfect tuning and their powerful sound is very rare today, because this <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> years of practice and passion to be performed at its best.|$|E
