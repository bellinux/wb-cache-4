5|$|Throughout the day, police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, {{and water}} cannons into crowds during violent clashes between {{authorities}} and protesters throughout Egypt. In Port Said {{tens of thousands}} gathered and multiple government buildings were set ablaze. In Suez, police shot and killed at least one protestor. Protestors in Suez took control of a police station, freed arrested protesters and then burned down a nearby smaller local police post. The government issued an 18:00 to 7:00 curfew, but protesters ignored it and were met by police. In the evening, one of the National Democratic Party (NDP) headquarters buildings in Cairo was set on fire by an unidentified culprit. While protesters paused for evening prayers, police continued firing tear gas. The day's defiance was <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the plethora of Tunisian national flags and anti-Mubarak graffiti that the protesters had created in the Greater Cairo region, Alexandria, Beni Suef, Mansoura and Manufiya.|$|E
5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E
25|$|The current {{situation}} of Romansh is quite well researched. The number of speakers is known through the Swiss censuses, {{with the most}} recent having taken place in 2000, in addition to surveys by the Radio e Televisiun Rumantscha.

25|$|Some ichneumonid species {{lay their}} eggs in the ground, but most inject them either {{directly}} into their host's body or on its surface. After hatching, the ichneumonid larva eats its host alive. The most common hosts are larvae or pupae of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, but some species also parasitise spiders. Hyperparasitoids such as Mesochorinae oviposit inside the larvae of other ichneumonids. The hosts of many species are unknown; host information has been <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> e.g. Aubert, Perkins. and Townes.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Scotus {{said that}} Mary was {{redeemed}} {{in anticipation of}} Christ's death on the cross. This {{was similar to the}} way that the Church explained the Last Supper, since Roman Catholic theology teaches that the Mass is the sacrifice of Calvary made present on the altar, and Christ did not die before the Last Supper. Scotus' defence of the immaculist thesis was <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> one of his followers as potuit, decuit ergo fecit – God could do it, it was fitting that He did it, and so He did it.|$|E
25|$|This {{is one of}} {{the major}} themes of Petty's writings, <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> his use of the phrase vadere sicut vult, whence we get laissez-faire. As {{mentioned}} earlier, the motif of medicine was also useful to Petty, and he warned against over-interference by the government in the economy, seeing it as analogous to a physician tampering excessively with his patient. He applied this to monopolies, controls on the exportation of money and on the trade of commodities. They were, to him, vain and harmful to a nation. He recognised the price effects of monopolies, citing the French king's salt monopoly as an example. In another work, Political Arithmetic, Petty also recognised the importance of economies of scale. He described the phenomenon of the division of labour, asserting that a good is both of better quality and cheaper, if many work on it. Petty said that the gain is greater 'as the manufacture itself is greater'.|$|E

25|$|Chichele and {{the other}} envoys were {{received}} on their return as saviours of the world; though the result was <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> a contemporary as trischism instead of schism, and the Church as giving three husbands instead of two. Chichele now {{became the subject of}} a leading case, the court of kings bench deciding, after arguments reheard in three successive terms, that he could not hold his previous benefices with the bishopric, and that, spite of the maxim Papa potest omnia, a papal bull could not supersede {{the law of the land}} (Year-book ii. H. iv. 37, 59, 79). Accordingly, he had to resign livings and canonries wholesale (28 April 1410). As, however, he had obtained a bull (20 August 1409) enabling him to appoint his successors to the vacated preferments, including his nephew William, though still an undergraduate and not in orders, to the chancellorship of Salisbury, and a prebend at Lichfield, he did not go empty away. In May 1410 he went again on an embassy to France; on 11 September 1411 he headed a mission to discuss Henry V's marriage with a daughter of the duke of Burgundy; and he was again there in November.|$|E

500|$|The Harris Theater {{has been}} the subject of {{numerous}} reviews, which are probably best <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the Chicago Tribunes architecture critic Blair Kamin, who describes it as a [...] "solid, though not unqualified, success", while giving it a two star rating (out of a possible four). Among the foibles that he notes were the off-putting industrial aesthetics, mundane concrete-framing, under-refined modest palette and blunt entrance. However, Kamin praises the spacious lobby and the theater's underground design as a concession to preserve the green lakefront.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate about}} Larkin is <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> Matthew Johnson, who observes {{that in most}} {{evaluations}} of Larkin [...] "one is not really discussing the man, but actually reading a coded and implicit discussion of the supposed values of 'Englishness' that he is held to represent". Changing attitudes to Englishness are reflected in changing attitudes to Larkin, and the more sustained intellectual interest in the English national character, as embodied {{in the works of}} Peter Mandler for instance, pinpoint one key reason why there is an increased scholarly interest in Larkin.|$|E
500|$|Like the manga, the anime {{has been}} well {{received}} but does not avoid criticism; in particular {{the quality of the}} animation for both seasons, including the OVAs, has attracted mixed reviews.

500|$|Hitler became {{enamored with}} Grotte's concept and ordered Krupp to begin {{development}} {{of it in}} 1942.

[...] These submitted designs went under the titles OKH Auftrag Nr. 30404 and E-30404/1. Albert Speer saw no reasonable use of the tank and canceled the project in 1943 before any prototype could be manufactured, although this did lead {{to the concept of}} the Landkreuzer P. 1500 Monster self-propelled siege gun, which would have been heavier than the Ratte.
