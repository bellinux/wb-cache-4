Eidos Interactive, whose release of Tomb Raider had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port. The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time. To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a triangular shape for the cover and box. They agreed on a contract price of $1.8 million, making initial <b>sales</b> <b>forecasts</b> of 100,000 units based on that outlay. The PC version was released in North America and Europe on June 25, 1998; the port was not released in Japan. Within one month, sales of the port exceeded the initial forecasts.

A demo for Japan was released in 2006, featuring a basic build of its battle system. In hindsight, a demo release this early was seen as a mistake as it gave players a negative impression of the battle system.

RESEARCH ISSUE AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <b>Sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> is common practice in the retail industry but little is known of what methods and techniques are used and what the attitudes towards <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> management are. Since this is not documented and <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> works as an important information input to organizational planning, we will empirically explore and analyze the attitudes towards <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> management and the familiarity with forecasting techniques within the organization of KappAhl. What are the attitudes towards <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> management within different departments {{involved in the process}} at KappAhl? -especially the attitudes towards four aspects of current practice; quality, availability, usability and satisfaction METHOD In order to explore and analyze the attitudes towards the <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> process within KappAhl, a questionnaire, regarding this and the familiarity with different forecasting techniques, was sent to people involved with the <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> process. EMPIRICAL FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Overall, forces within KappAhl desire a more unified view on how to produce and use a <b>sales</b> <b>forecast.</b> If instructions and routines are made clear for the producers, they will give the forecasts a higher credibility since the forecasts become more consistent over time. If old forecasts are followed-up, saved and later used as references for similar situations, it will be easier to achieve a higher rate of accuracy in the future. Implementation of measurements of the accuracy will over time increase the accuracy itself since the follow-up is used to evaluate the performance...|$|R

Experimental results from a real sales data show that the <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> scheme by integrating stICA and SVR outperforms the comparison models in terms of forecasting error.

In a {{world of}} unpredictability and complexity, <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> is becoming recognised as essential to operations planning in business and industry. With increased globalisation and higher competition, more products are being developed at more locations, but with shorter product lifecycles. As technology improves, more sophisticated <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> systems are developed which require increasing complexity. We tum to adaptive agent architectures to consider an alternative approach for modelling complex <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> systems. This research proposes modelling a <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> system using an adaptive agent architecture. It additionally investigates the suitability of Bayesian networks as a <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> technique. This is achieved through BaBe, an adaptive agent architecture which employs Bayesian networks as internal models. We develop a <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> system for a meat wholesale company whose sales are largely affected by exogenous factors. The company's current <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> approach is solely qualitative, {{and the nature of}} their sales is such that they would benefit from a reliable exogenous data <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> system. We implement the system using BaBe, and incorporate a Bayesian network representing the causal relationships affecting sales. We introduce a learning adjustment component to adjust the estimated sales towards closer approximations. This is required as BaBe is currently unable to use continuous data, resulting in a loss of accuracy during discretisation. The learning adjustment additionally provides a feedback aspect, often found in adaptive agent architectures. The adjustment algorithm is based on the mean error calculation, commonly used as <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> performance measures, but is extended to incorporate a number of exogenous variables. We test the system using the holdout procedure, with a 5 -fold cross validation data-splitting approach, and contrast the accuracy of the estimated sales, provided by the system, with sales estimated using a regression approach. We additionally investigate the effectiveness of the learning adjustment component...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades {{important}} advances have been made in developing <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> methods that more accurately reflect market place conditions. However, surveys of <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> practice continue to report only marginal gains in <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> effectiveness. This gap between theory and practice has been identified as a significant issue for <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> research. The literature suggests that this gap should be addressed by examining new factors in <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting.</b> Accuracy, bias, timeliness, cost and environmental turbulence are the most studied <b>forecasting</b> criteria in <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> effectiveness. There are some literatures which address how these factors are affected by the forecast methods the firm uses. Empirical evidence on such a role of the forecasting method is lacking, and existing literature {{does not take into account}} whether forecasting criteria's influence on export <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> effectiveness vary depending on the forecasting methods used by the firm. This is the first research gap identified during the literature review. Furthermore, the role of export <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting.</b> effectiveness on export market performance have received only limited attention to date. Linking the forecasting effectiveness to the business performance was reported to be critical in evaluating and improving the firm's <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> capability and <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> climate. However, empirical evidence of this linkage is missing and this is the second gap this study addresses. A conceptual model is proposed and multivariate analysis technique is used to investigate the relationship between dependent (forecasting effectiveness and export performance) and independent variables (forecasting criteria, forecasting methods, managerial characteristics, organizational characteristics and export market orientation). Our finding revealed the impact of bias, timeliness and cost on forecasting effectiveness varies depending on the forecasting methods used by the firm. But no moderating impact of forecasting methods has been found for accuracy and environmental turbulence. Moreover, this study reported the linkage between forecasting effectiveness and export performance when composite forecasting method is used. Identifying the relative importance of all the factors (i. e. accuracy, bias, cost, timeliness, forecasting methods, etc) it becomes possible to set priorities directly reflecting managerial preferences for different forecast criteria.
