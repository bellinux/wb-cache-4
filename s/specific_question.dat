5|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in Salinas v. Texas, 570 U.S. ___ (2013), on June 17, 2013, holding that a suspect's silence {{in response to}} a <b>specific</b> <b>question</b> posed during an interview with police when the suspect was not in custody and the suspect had been voluntarily answering other questions during that interview could be used against him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence in response to the <b>specific</b> <b>question.</b> Of the five justices who concluded that the suspect's silence could be used against him in these circumstances, Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy concluded that the defendant's Fifth Amendment claim failed because he did not expressly invoke the privilege. The other two Justices, Thomas and Scalia, concluded that the defendant's claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege, on the theory that the prosecutor's comment at the trial—regarding the defendant's silence {{in response to a}} question during the police interview—did not compel the defendant to give self-incriminating testimony.|$|E

Paper {{presented at the}} biannual meeting of the European Association for Research on Learning and Instruction, Exeter, Great Britain. Tested information is retained longer than studied information. This, so called, testing effect is thoroughly studied in memory research. Recently, {{a renewed interest in}} the testing effect in an educational context can be observed. This study is placed within this line of research and investigates two aspects of the testing effect, namely, effortful retrieval and retrieval induced facilitation. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three experimental conditions that differed in the learning strategy used. Participants either restudied a text that they had received, answered <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> after studying the text, or answered less <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> after studying the text. It is assumed that more effort is needed to answer the less <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> than to answer the <b>specific</b> <b>questions.</b> Therefore, we hypothesize that the less <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> will produce a stronger testing effect than the <b>specific</b> <b>questions.</b> In addition, we investigate if the benefits of taking an initial test spill over to answering questions that were not initially tested. The results of this study confirm that answering less <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> requires more effort, however, this does not pay off in a better retention of facts after a week. Nevertheless, a testing was found for the <b>specific</b> <b>questions.</b> No spill over effects were found...|$|R

The former group would work to create a central administrative body to coordinate and regulate land use planning on a statewide basis; the latter would study the <b>specific</b> <b>question</b> of farmland preservation and the regulation of construction of subdivisions.

25|$|In Islam, {{there are}} four sources from which Muslim {{scholars}} extract religious law or rulings, and upon which they base their fatwa. The first is the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, and which Muslims believe is the direct and literal word of God, revealed to Prophet Mohammad. The second source is the Sunnah, which incorporates anything that the Prophet Mohammad said, did or approved of. The third source is the consensus of the scholars, meaning that if the scholars of a previous generation have all agreed on a certain issue, then this consensus is regarded as representing Islam. Finally, if no scripture is found regarding a <b>specific</b> <b>question</b> from the three first sources, then an Islamic scholar performs {{what is known as}} ijtihad. This means that they use their own logic and reasoning {{to come up with the}} best answer according to the best of their ability.|$|E
25|$|Differential item {{functioning}} (DIF), {{sometimes referred}} to as measurement bias, is a phenomenon when participants from different groups (ex gender, race, disability) with the same latent abilities give different answers to specific questions on the same IQ test. DIF analysis measures such specific items on a test alongside measuring participants latent abilities on other similar questions. A consistent different group response to a <b>specific</b> <b>question</b> among similar type of questions can indicate an effect of DIF. It does not count as differential item functioning if both groups have equally valid chance of giving different responses to the same questions. Such bias can be a result of culture, educational level and other factors that are independent of group traits. DIF is only considered if test-takers from different groups with the same underlying latent ability level have a different chance of giving specific responses. Such questions are usually removed {{in order to make the}} test equally fair for both groups. Common techniques for analyzing DIF are item response theory (IRT) based methods, Mantel-Haenszel, and logistic regression.|$|E

6000|$|The method {{now under}} {{consideration}} {{is called the}} Empirical Method; {{and in order to}} estimate it fairly, we must suppose it to be completely, not incompletely, empirical. We must exclude from it every thing which partakes of the nature not of an experimental but of a deductive operation. If, for instance, we try experiments with mercury upon a person in health, in order to ascertain the general laws of its action upon the human body, and then reason from these laws to determine how it will act upon persons affected with a particular disease, this may be a really effectual method; but this is deduction. The experimental method does not derive the law of a complex case from the simpler laws which conspire to produce it, but makes its experiments directly upon the complex case. We must make entire abstraction of all knowledge of the simpler tendencies, the modi operandi of mercury in detail.
