50|$|<b>Snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys</b> are a {{group of}} Old World monkeys and make up the {{entirety}} of the genus Rhinopithecus. The genus occurs rarely and needs much more research. Some taxonomists group <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys</b> together with the Pygathrix genus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys</b> live in Asia, {{with a range}} {{covering}} southern China (especially Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou) as well as {{the northern}} parts of Vietnam and Myanmar.|$|E
50|$|Several Old World monkeys have {{anatomical}} oddities. For example, the colobus monkeys have stubs for thumbs {{to assist}} with their arboreal movement, the proboscis monkey has an extraordinary nose, while the <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys</b> have almost no nose at all.|$|E
50|$|The black <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey</b> {{was almost}} {{completely}} unknown until the 1990s. The {{fact that no}} single zoo outside China has ever kept the black <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey</b> in captivity {{has contributed to the}} enigmatic status of this species. The black <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey</b> lives {{in one of the most}} extreme environments of any nonhuman primate. Its habitat is either pure temperate coniferous forest or deciduous/evergreen broadleaf and coniferous forest. The highest recorded altitude of a group of this species is 4700 m. The black <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey</b> lives in very large super-groups which are made up of single-male core families or harems. The monkey moves fast and far in a cohesive group and covers vast areas in search of lichens and other seasonally available food items.|$|R

5000|$|Even {{though they}} are known as [...] "douc langurs", {{they are in fact}} more closely related to the {{proboscis}} monkey and <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys</b> than to any of the langurs. They are part of the subfamily Colobinae of the family Cercopithecidae.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 16 October 2011, a forest guard at Gaoligongshan National Nature Reserve (GNNR), China took photos {{of a group of}} <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys</b> which were later {{identified}} as R. strykery. This made a breaking headline in China especially on the urgent need for a conservation programme.|$|E

50|$|The {{reproduction}} {{cycles of}} black snub-nosed monkey is generally {{similar to that}} of golden <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys,</b> except the time of birth is often two to three months later due to colder climate. Like most primates, the snub-nosed monkey gives birth at night, making it difficult for researchers to observe. A rare observation of a daytime birth found a multiparous female assisting another female in the birthing process, similar to human midwifery practice.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the world's largest population of homo sapiens, China {{is also home to}} a dozen other primate species including gibbons, macaques, leaf monkeys, gray langurs, <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys</b> and lorises. Unlike human beings, who number over 1.3 billion, most of China's other primate species are endangered. Both apes and monkeys, particularly gibbons and macaques are prominently featured in Chinese culture, folk religion, art and literature. Monkey is one of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac.|$|E
50|$|The golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana) is an Old World monkey in the Colobinae subfamily. It is {{endemic to}} a small area in temperate, mountainous forests of central and Southwest China. They inhabit these mountainous forests of Southwestern China at {{elevations}} of 1,500-3,400 m above sea level. The Chinese name is Sichuan golden hair monkey (川金丝猴). It is also widely {{referred to as the}} Sichuan snub-nosed monkey. Of the three species of <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys</b> in China, the golden snub-nosed monkey is the most widely distributed throughout China.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Study on {{effects of}} climate change on species is very popular and {{necessary}} at present. This paper investigated the {{effects of climate}} change on the distribution of <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey</b> in China using Arcgis and Maxent model. It compared the historical and modern distribution of <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey</b> in China, and evaluated the {{effects of climate change}} on Rhinopithecus bieti to explore effects on the distribution of <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey,</b> so as to protect them. Results indicate that the distribution range of <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey</b> has decreased greatly from the previous 17 to 8 provinces. The distribution trends are from north to south, east to west, dense to sparse and form several isolated distribution areas. Moreover, six precipitation variables are identified as having remarkable effects on the habitat suitability of Rhinopithecus bieti and therefore protective actions can be taken accordingly...|$|R

50|$|The golden snub-nosed monkey {{is found}} in groups {{ranging in size from}} 5-10 {{individuals}} to bands of about 600. The social organization of this species can be quite complex. The one-male-units (OMUs) are the basic social unit within groups of golden <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys</b> with many of the OMUs forming a bigger group. These multi-tier societies consist of several OMUs that include one adult male plus a number of adult females and their offspring. Some observers have even come to conclude that these large foraging groups are multi-male and multi-female societies.|$|E
50|$|The gray snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus brelichi), {{also known}} as Brelich's snub-nosed monkey, Guizhou snub-nosed monkey, and Guizhou golden monkey, is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is endemic to China, where it {{is known as the}} Guizhou golden hair monkey (黔金丝猴) or gray golden hair monkey (灰金丝猴). It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss. Of the three species of <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys</b> in China, the gray snub-nosed monkey is the most threatened, with a total population of less than 750 in around 20 groups surviving in the wild.|$|E
50|$|<b>Snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys</b> inhabit {{mountain}} forests up to {{a height}} of 4,000 m, in the winter moving into the deeply secluded regions. They spend {{the majority of their}} life in the trees. They live together in very large groups of up to 600 members, splitting up into smaller groups in times of food-scarcity, such as in the winter. Groups consist of many more males than females. They have territorial instincts, defending their territory mostly with shouts. They have a large vocal repertoire, calling sometimes solo while at other times together in choir-like fashion.|$|E
50|$|The Myanmar <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey</b> or Burmese <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey</b> (Rhinopithecus strykeri) is a {{critically}} threatened species of colobine monkey discovered in 2010 in northern Burma (Myanmar). It was formally {{described as a}} novel species of primate in 2011 based on its fur, beard and tail. A group of the species was discovered in China in 2011.|$|R
50|$|The black <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey</b> (Rhinopithecus bieti), {{also known}} as the Yunnan <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey,</b> is an {{endangered}} species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is endemic to China, where it is known to the locals as the Yunnan golden hair monkey (滇金丝猴) and the black golden hair monkey (黑金丝猴). It is threatened by habitat loss. It was named after Bishop Félix Biet.|$|R

50|$|When first discovered, {{the only}} known {{specimens}} existed {{in three or four}} groups within a 270 km2 range at 1700 to(-) 3200 m above sea level in the eastern Himalayas, in the north-eastern section of Kachin State, the northernmost part of Burma (Myanmar). In 2011, a population was discovered in Lushui County, Yunnan, China. The species is isolated from other snub-nosed Rhinopithecus by the Mekong and the Salween rivers; the other 4 species, golden, black, gray and Tonkin <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys,</b> are found in China and Vietnam. The species shares habitat with Shortridge's langur, stump-tailed macaque, Assam macaque, rhesus macaque, and northern pig-tailed macaque.|$|E
5000|$|Mesopithecus ("middle monkey") is an extinct genus of Old World monkey {{that lived}} in Europe and western Asia 7 to 5 million years ago. It was once thought {{that it might be}} an {{ancestor}} of the grey langur, but a more recent study suggests that they are more closely related to the <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys</b> and doucs. [...] Mesopithecus resembled a modern macaque, with a body length of about 40 cm. It was adapted to both walking and climbing, possessing a slender body with long, muscular limbs and flexible fingers. Its teeth suggest that it primarily ate soft leaves and fruit.|$|E
50|$|The {{giant panda}} {{is the most}} famous species of the reserve. Other typical larger Carnivora are North-Chinese leopards, Ussuri dholes, Asian black bears, Asiatic golden cats, red pandas, hog badgers and yellow-throated martens. Hooved mammals are {{represented}} by Sichuan takins, wild boar, musk deer, mainland serows, Chinese gorals, tufted deer and sambar deer. Other noticeable mammals include golden <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys,</b> Tibetan macaques, complex-toothed flying squirrels, bamboo rats, and porcupines. Because the reserve comprises different altitudes, it includes tropical and temperate climate zones and harbors species typically for the tropics, like clouded leopards and sambar deer as well as species from temperate regions, like white-lipped deer, snow leopards and Turkestan lynxes.|$|E

50|$|The black <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey</b> is a large, stocky and well-furred primate {{belonging}} to the leaf-monkey Colobinae subfamily. Despite its morphological distinctiveness and noteworthy biology {{this is one of}} the lesser known primate species. In recent years, however, knowledge about the behavior and ecology of the black <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>monkey</b> has grown. Lack of information is mainly a result of difficult research conditions due to the monkey's semi-nomadic lifestyle, elusive nature and inhospitable habitat with extremely steep hillsides, impenetrable bamboo thickets, freezing winter climate with snow as well as damp and foggy summers with minimum visibility.|$|R
50|$|<b>Snub-nosed</b> <b>monkeys</b> are {{so named}} because they have only {{nostrils}} and virtually no nose. Four of the five species {{in the world are}} found in China, including three that are endemic. All live in mountainous forests at elevations of 1,500-3,400 m above sea level. The golden snub-nosed monkey is most famous and most widely distributed, with subspecies in Sichuan, Hubei and Shaanxi. The gray snub-nosed monkey is the most endangered, with about 700 individuals, found only in Guizhou. The black snub-nosed monkey has about 1,700 individuals living in 17 identified groups in Yunnan and eastern Tibet. A small population of Myanmar snub-nosed monkey was found in western Yunnan in 2011.|$|E
