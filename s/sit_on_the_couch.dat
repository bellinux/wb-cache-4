5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard, Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b>|$|E
25|$|On July 27, 2004, American cable {{television}} network TV Land unveiled a life-sized statue of Newhart on the Magnificent Mile {{in his native}} Chicago, depicting Dr. Robert Hartley from The Bob Newhart Show. The statue depicts Dr. Hartley sitting in his therapy practice chair with a pencil held between his hands, and a patients' sofa next to him. After an initial temporary installation in front of 430 North Michigan Avenue, the building used for exterior establishing shots of Hartley's office, the bronze set is now permanently located in the sculpture park in front of Chicago's Navy Pier entertainment complex. Visitors routinely <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and pose for photographs as Bob's patients.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{includes}} various cultural references, including Johnson & Johnson's [...] "No more tears" [...] slogan. Peter is seen watching Spike TV. Stewie {{enters a}} fight with Susie over a Barbie doll. Stewie composes a song about his toned body, pronouncing the word body as [...] "bah-dy" [...] {{a reference to the}} pronunciation of the word in John Mayer's [...] "Your Body Is a Wonderland". Chris's nude dance is a reference to a similar scene in The Silence Of The Lambs; this is in itself an in-joke as Chris Griffin's voice was initially Seth Green's impression of Buffalo Bill. Brian compares Stewie's muscular body to actor Lou Ferrigno's feces. Lois and Brian <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> while they watch Lady and the Tramp and Michael Vick. Adam Sandler's movie career is referenced. Connie's best friend Gina says that Chris smells like Fred Flintstone's behind. Folkloric figure Santa Claus is seen getting a DUI.|$|E

500|$|In January 2011, Fark was sued in Los Angeles Federal Court by Gooseberry Natural Resources, LLC, for {{allegedly}} violating US Patent No. 6,370,535, titled, [...] "System and method for structured news release generation and distribution." [...] This patent, awarded in 2002, involves typing text into an administration system, storing it on a server, and publishing {{it on the}} Internet. Other defendants sued in the case include Reddit, The Atlanta-Journal Constitution, Digg, Geeknet (owner of Slashdot), TechCrunch, Newsvine, and Yahoo. Drew Curtis argued that Fark does not produce [...] "news releases" [...] or [...] "press releases", as the lawsuit stated, and instead provides a forum for humorous links to stories on other websites. The case was settled in August 2011, for the sum of $0. Curtis later described the entire ordeal as, [...] "a nightmare", saying, [...] "Imagine someone breaking into your home, then being forced to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> while their lawyers file motions over how much stuff they can take." [...] At the 2012 TED Conference in Long Beach, California, he referred to patent trolls as [...] "terrorists", comparing them to the Abu Sayyaf terror group in the Philippines, which kidnapped people for ransom, collected small sums of money, expanded with more personnel and equipment, and then kidnapped more people for higher ransoms.|$|E
2500|$|Newman {{had written}} some songs for the album: [...] "My method of writing songs, which I hadn't used for 30 years, {{is to write}} them on {{acoustic}} guitar. They take an average of five minutes each. If it's not written in five minutes, it's {{not going to get}} written. I'd <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> play a bit, if I had some words from Graham, jam 'em in, record it to my iPhone, then I'd present a bunch of songs to Rob and Graham. Rob said , 'It sounds like the '70s' and Graham said, 'I hate acoustic guitar,' so I knew we were onto a winner. That's so classic Wire." ...|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{immediately}} following the team selection, controversy arose regarding the two teams selected. Michigan State QB Kirk Cousins, whose team failed {{to qualify for a}} BCS game because it did not finish in the top 14 of the BCS standings, criticized the potential selection of Michigan after his team's debilitating 42-39 loss [...] to Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game, [...] "I don't see how you get punished for playing and someone else gets to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and get what they want". Michigan State had defeated the University of Michigan 28-14 in East Lansing earlier that season. [...] Others criticized the selection of Virginia Tech, stating that both Kansas State and Boise State were more deserving of the bid and that the bowl committee had chosen a familiar team as opposed to a new one. [...] The bowl was considered the lowest-ranked match-up of two teams {{in the history of the}} BCS.|$|E

2500|$|Following his {{departure}} from Guns N' Roses, according to Adler, {{he was set}} to join AC/DC and relocate to Australia. However, during the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1990, Axl Rose announced Adler's firing onstage and branded him a drug addict, which Adler said caused AC/DC's manager to withdraw their offer. Adler instead reformed Road Crew with a new line-up, consisting of former Vain members singer Davy Vain, guitarist Jamie Scott, and bassist Ashley Mitchell, along with guitarist Shawn Rorie. They recorded an album and attracted attention from a major label, but due to Adler's persistent drug problems, the group disbanded shortly thereafter. Adler then entered a prolonged, self-imposed exile from the music industry; he later recalled, [...] "I wish I could say that I {{did a lot of}} traveling or self-improvement, but all I actually did was <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and get high—while the TV watched me.

5000|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{released}} on 7 July 2016. The video opens with an extended sequence resembling David Lynch's short film Rabbits. Lead singer Matt Healy walks into a living room in clown makeup, which was previously seen in the music video for [...] "A Change of Heart", while a woman <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> in a collapsed position. Like in Rabbits, Healy's actions in the room seem randomly soundtracked by a studio laugh track, including whoops, hollers and applause. He removes his clown makeup, <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and speaks in an exceptionally distorted, unintelligble voice to the woman before leaving again. As the song begins, the video shifts its tone by moving into colour footage. Healy tries to deal with heartbreak on a night alone, by crying, drinking, dancing and eventually {{having sex with a}} stripper {{in the back seat of}} an automobile. Near the end, Healy seems to come to his senses and realizes that not only is he hallucinating most of his interactions with others in these situations, but that some of the other people are copies of himself (in the case of the stripper, he finds himself alone in the backseat, stroking his own face and chest.) The video was based on a story that Healy wrote.|$|R

He provides advice to families by observing their interaction with their canine companions and then analyzing the weak points. Proper training with basic commands such as the [...] "Sit" [...] command and behavioral cues such as ignoring the dog when he transgresses and <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> have been credited with turning the behavior of an unruly dog around.|$|R

5000|$|Uncle Vijay: Uncle Vijay is an elderly, Indian man who <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> {{watching}} TV while ranting at {{the things}} he sees <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen. Many cultural references are made through the various shows he watches, including; Doctor Who, Glee, The Big Bang Theory, Wheel of Fortune and even the show itself. Many of the shows he gives commentary on, foreshadows a sketch the cast will later perform. Hayden once explained that the character of Uncle Vijay was inspired by his grandfather who {{has a tendency to}} get verbal with the TV.
