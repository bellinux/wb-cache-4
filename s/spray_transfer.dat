5|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>{{transfer}}</b> GMAW was {{the first}} metal transfer method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding aluminium and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the weld electrode metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit transfer the weld electrode metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized <b>spray</b> <b>transfer</b> variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer, {{and as a result}} of the higher heat input and larger weld pool area (for a given weld electrode diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of the <b>spray</b> <b>transfer</b> mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of <b>spray</b> <b>transfer</b> but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} a {{shielding}} gas depends on several factors, most importantly the type of material being welded and the process variation being used. Pure inert gases such as argon and helium are only used for nonferrous welding; with steel they do not provide adequate weld penetration (argon) or cause an erratic arc and encourage spatter (with helium). Pure carbon dioxide, on the other hand, allows for deep penetration welds but encourages oxide formation, which adversely affect the mechanical properties of the weld. lts low cost makes it an attractive choice, {{but because of the}} reactivity of the arc plasma, spatter is unavoidable and welding thin materials is difficult. As a result, argon and carbon dioxide are frequently mixed in a 75%/25% to 90%/10% mixture. Generally, in short circuit GMAW, higher carbon dioxide content increases the weld heat and energy when all other weld parameters (volts, current, electrode type and diameter) are held the same. As the carbon dioxide content increases over 20%, <b>spray</b> <b>transfer</b> GMAW becomes increasingly problematic, especially with smaller electrode diameters.|$|E

500|$|The {{desirable}} rate of shielding-gas flow depends {{primarily on}} weld geometry, speed, current, {{the type of}} gas, and the metal transfer mode. Welding flat surfaces requires higher flow than welding grooved materials, since gas disperses more quickly. Faster welding speeds, in general, mean that more gas must be supplied to provide adequate coverage. Additionally, higher current requires greater flow, and generally, more helium is required to provide adequate coverage than if argon is used. Perhaps most importantly, the four primary variations of GMAW have differing shielding gas flow requirementsfor the small weld pools of the short circuiting and pulsed spray modes, about 10L/min (20ft³/h) is generally suitable, whereas for globular transfer, around 15L/min (30ft³/h) is preferred.

50|$|In gas {{tungsten}} arc welding (GTAW), inert gases {{are used to}} shield the tungsten from contamination. It also shields the fluid metal (created from the arc) from the reactive gases in air which can cause porosity in the solidified weld puddle. Inert gases are also used in gas metal arc welding (GMAW) for welding non-ferrous metals. Some gases which are not usually considered inert but which behave like inert gases in all the circumstances likely to be encountered in some use can often be used as a substitute for an inert gas. This is useful when an appropriate pseudo-inert gas can be found which is inexpensive and common. For example, carbon dioxide is sometimes used in gas mixtures for GMAW because it is not reactive to the weld pool created by arc welding. But it is reactive to the arc. The more carbon dioxide that is added to the inert gas, such as argon, will increase your penetration. The amount of carbon dioxide is often determined by what kind of transfer you will be using in GMAW. The most common is <b>spray</b> arc <b>transfer,</b> and the most commonly used gas mixture for <b>spray</b> arc <b>transfer</b> is 90% argon and 10% carbon dioxide.

In order to control heat transfer rates and obtain desired surface temperature distributions, {{a deeper understanding of}} fundamental spray cooling dynamics and more accurate estimation of <b>spray</b> heat <b>transfer</b> rates is needed. In this thesis, a new technique combining experiment and computational modeling has been developed for measuring the steady-state heat transfer extracted locally by water sprays or air-mists impinging on the surface of a hot metallic sample. 	The experimental apparatus was developed by A. C. Hernandez B., H. Castillejos E, and F. A. Acosta Gat CINVESTAV, Mexico, and is designed to be able to employ spray water to cool the metallic sample accommodated inside a copper coil with an alternating current as induction heating goes on inside the sample. Control of total input power from the wall maintains each desired sample thermocouple temperature. A computational model developed using the commercial finite-element package COMSOL Mutiphysics uses a two-dimensional axisymmetric model of the electromagnetics and heat-conduction equations to balance the heat extracted from the sample surface by the boiling water droplets. Measurement of the RMS current flowing through the copper coil enables the model to estimate the heat extracted to the cooling spray by matching the sample thermocouple temperature measurement. Heat transfer coefficients and fluxes are quantified for spray cooling of a platinum sample at temperatures ranging from 100 - 1200 ???C, using typical air-mist nozzles and conditions relevant to steel continuous casting, and also compared with transient measurement results of spray cooling and Nozaki empirical correlation.
