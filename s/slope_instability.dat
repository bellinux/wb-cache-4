40|$|We {{present a}} {{regional}} hazard assessment of earth-quake-triggered <b>slope</b> <b>instabilities</b> based on specific seismic scenarios and {{taking into account}} soil and topographic amplification effects. We followed New-mark’s sliding rigid-block methodology implemented in a geographic information system (GIS) {{with the aim of}} producing regional maps in terms of critical acceleration and Newmark displacements for selected seismic scenar-ios. Strong ground-motion amplification site effects have been considered, particularly the topographic factor, by means of designing a GIS tool based on terrain geometry features and Eurocode- 8 provisions. Three different concepts of seismic scenarios are considered in this work: probabilistic, pseudo-probabilistic, and deterministic. The study area is the Lorca Basin, located in the Eastern Betic Cordillera, one of the most seismically active regions of southeast Spain. The obtained Newmark displacement maps are compared to the distribution of known <b>slope</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the area. Future seismically induced <b>slope</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the Lorca Basin appear to be limited to isolated rock slides and rockfalls.

40|$|The Little Mill Campground lies on {{the bottom}} of the deeply incised American Fork Canyon and is {{surrounded}} by high cliffs made of dolomite and limestone. Rock-fall activity is quite well known in the study area. Since the 1990 ies the rock-fall events are inventoried. Potential rock instabilities were identified and a preliminary hazard assessment shows that most campsites are downslope from areas with moderate to very high rock-fall susceptibility (Coe et al. 2005). This study aims to identify large <b>slope</b> <b>instabilities</b> around the Little Mill Campground (Uinta National Forest, Utah, USA) site by means of analysis of digital elevation models (DEM). The developed approach allows to determine the rock-fall susceptibility for each DEM cell and thus to detect <b>slope</b> <b>instabilities</b> and their propagation zones at various scales. <b>Slope</b> <b>instabilities</b> are caused by several factors. Some of them are purely geometric and can be assessed using a DEM (Baillifard et al. 2003, Derron et al. 2005).

40|$|Rock slope {{failures}} form {{a frequent}} hazard to many populated mountain regions. Especially in western Norway, the topographical and meteorological characteristics increase the vulnerability for rock slope failures. A major focus for studies in Norway is to eciently nd and investigate possible future rock slope failures {{in order to}} prevent extensive humanitarian disasters. The determination of the critical parameters involved in the development of rock slope failures is crucial in order to optimize hazard recognition. In addition, {{a better understanding of the}} spatial and temporal variability of prehistoric and historic rock slope failures as well as present day rock <b>slope</b> <b>instabilities</b> will optimize monitoring and further research on the susceptibility for future rock slope failures. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of rock <b>slope</b> <b>instabilities</b> within western Norway. It is further aimed to determine the controlling parameters on the development of rock <b>slope</b> <b>instabilities</b> within the study region. The implemented approaches range from regional scale statistical analyses towards site specic numerical modelling, while a focus is set on quantitative analyses. Within this thesis the main controlling parameters are dened for rockfalls and rock <b>slope</b> <b>instabilities</b> on a regional scale for the entire county of Sogn & Fjordane, western Norway. It is demonstrated that always a combination of several parameters is necessary to destabilize a mountain side. Rockfalls have the strongest spatial relation to the presence of bare rock as well as landslide deposits, the degree of tectonic deformation and the geological lineament density. Large rock <b>slope</b> <b>instabilities</b> develop preferentially within relatively weak rock units, such as phyllites or weathered mac gneisses, and at convex slope breaks. Looking more into detail, a strong structural control is conrmed by numerical modelling for the unstable rock slope at Stampa. Susceptibility and hazard are assessed at dierent scales and with dierent measures. Quantitative rockfall susceptibility is mapped on a regional scale for the entire county of Sogn & Fjordane based on the statistical analysis of a set of controlling factors. In addition, this statistical susceptibility model is combined with a physically based model, restricting the susceptibility map to areas that are steep enough to represent a potential rockfall source. This combination allows using road inventories, with registered impact points instead of release areas, for susceptibility modelling. In contrast, relative susceptibility and also hazard are assessed locally for single parts of the unstable rock slope at Stampa based on morphology and past activity. Present day annual expectable frequencies for rock slope failures of certain volume classes are determined for the Storfjord region in western Norway based on magnitude-frequency analyses. Furthermore, a semi quantitative hazard estimation is obtained for each potential instability based on a qualitative susceptibility assessment of each instability in this region. This PhD thesis presents results of the rst attempts of quantitative statistical analyses of dierent inventories covering rock <b>slope</b> <b>instabilities</b> in Norway. It is shown that susceptibility and hazard can be assessed with dierent measures, forming the basis for further decisions regarding risk assessment and mitigation.

40|$|Among the {{mountain}} ranges {{that surround the}} Somma-Vesuvius volcano (southern Italy), the Sarno and Lattari mounts are the closest and those where the highest thicknesses of ash-fall pyroclastic soils were deposited.

On the 72 investigated rock <b>slope</b> <b>instabilities,</b> 13 were developed in soft weathered mafic and phyllitic allochthons. Only the intrinsic weakness of such rocks increases the susceptibility to gravitational deformation. In contrast, the gravitational structures in the hard gneisses reactivate prominent ductile or/and brittle fabrics. At 30 rockslides along cataclinal slopes, weak mafic layers of foliation are reactivated as basal planes. Slope-parallel steep foliation forms back-cracks of unstable columns. Folds are specifically present in the Storfjord area, together with a clustering of potential slope failures. Folding increases the probability of having favourably orientated planes with respect to the gravitational forces and the slope. High water pressure is believed to seasonally build up along the shallow-dipping Caledonian detachments and may contribute to destabilization of the rock slope upwards.
