For this purpose, the influences of different heat-treatment conditions as well as warm forming on the single point incremental forming formability and post-forming properties of this material were investigated. Thermal pre-treatments were consisting of annealing (O-temper), solution treating and quenching (W-temper), and <b>solution</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treating,</b> quenching, and then cold working (T-temper). The formability results as well as forming forces of pre-heattreated sheets were compared {{to those of the}} warm forming process results carried out using a laser-assisted single point incremental forming (LASPIF) setup. The post-forming properties of SPIF-formed parts were analyzed by hardness testing. The maximum forming angles of the blank formed under O-temper and Wtemper conditions showed, respectively, 41 and 32 % increases compared to the one under T-temper condition. LASPIF forming of this material at a temperature of about 360 C resulted in 41 % improvement in the maximum forming angle with respect to parts formed at room temperature from the T-temper sheet. The hardness of the material reduced significantly after annealing, while SPIF parts formed from Wtemper blanks and under LASPIF condition regained their hardness after natural aging. The fracture surface characteristics of the failed parts showed that voids nucleate at the interface between intermetallic particles and matrix, and a dimple rupture fracture mode was identified under all heat-treatment conditions. Under O-temper condition, due to precipitation of particles along the grain boundary, an intergranular dimple rupture was observed. Finally, Energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) were used to investigate the possible effects of the heat treatment and the deformation on the changes in the composition of intermetallic and second-phase particles, grain size, and texture. status: publishe...|$|E

The novelty of this study was the characterisation of the behaviour of the lightweight aluminium-air cell, depending on the choice of aluminium anode and air-cathode. Development of the prototype aluminium-air cell involved three areas of study. For the first two high purity aluminium alloys, Al/ 0. 5 Mg/ 0. 07 Sn and Al/ 0. 4 Mg/ 0. 07 Sn/ 0. 05 Ga, were evaluated as anodes in a half-cell in 4 mol dm- 3 NaOH at 22 °C and 60 °C and compared against 99. 999 %wt aluminium.

For the second method of study, the electrochemistry of a LaCaCo 3 /LaCaMnO 3 air-electrode, known as KTH, supplied by a project collaborator, was compared against seven commercial gas diffusion electrodes. The catalysts on the commercial electrodes include Pt, MnOx, Ag 2 O and Co-based.

40|$|Manufacturing in {{automotive}} {{and aircraft}} industries are focused in improvement and cost reductions of forming {{processes such as}} stamping, drawing, and machining. Electrically assisted forming is a technique whereby metal is deformed while simultaneously electric current flow is induced. This recently developed process is presented {{as an alternative to}} traditional hot stamping manufacturing processes where larger ductility and reduction of maximum strength reduce the possibility of tearing or cracking during stamping by means of heat treatment. The effect of electroplastic employing electropulses on the mechanical properties of EN-AW 6082 aluminum alloy was studied. Various heat treatments were analyzed in order to examine comparatively different behaviors throughout the tensile test while electro-pulsing was induced. The structure of the study herein presents two main parts. The first part is the study of aging treatments of the AA 6082 taking in interest the well-known industrial conditions which are the natural aging condition (T 4), the artificial aging condition (T 6) as well as others of non-industrial interest such as the overaging condition, as well as the condition of the alloy directly quenched from the <b>solution</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treating</b> (SHT). The results presented in this investigation showed a well-known differentiated behavior during tensile testing of solution heat treated, natural aging (T 4), artificially peak-aged (T 6) and overaged samples. It is important to mention as well that starting material is a sheet of thickness 1 mm from manufactured in a rolling process, by this fact the rolling direction has been also part of the investigation specifying the 0 º, 45 º and 90 º respectively to the rolling direction in order to characterize anisotropy. The second part of this study has been focused entirely in the electroplastic effect utilizing electro-pulsing during tensile testing of AA 6082 for each heat treatment above mentioned. The performance of electro-pulsing has been varying frequency and pulse-length in consequence the constant energy has been also varied due that both parameters are related to the last mentioned and so a broad range of considerations has been well-thought-out. The goals of this project are to measure as accurately as possible the variations caused by the electroplastic effect and those variations had been limited mainly to those two factors above mentioned: ductility and maximum strength.

40|$|This {{report was}} {{prepared}} {{in accordance with}} ''Technical Work Plan for: Regulatory Integration Modeling and Analysis of the Waste Form and Waste Package'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 171583]). This report provides information on the phase stability of Alloy 22, the current waste package outer barrier material. The goal of this model is {{to determine whether the}} single-phase solid solution is stable under repository conditions and, if not, how fast other phases may precipitate. The aging and phase stability model, which is based on fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic concepts and principles, will be used to provide predictive insight into the long-term metallurgical stability of Alloy 22 under relevant repository conditions. The results of this model are used by ''General Corrosion and Localized Corrosion of Waste Package Outer Barrier'' as reference-only information. These phase stability studies are currently divided into three general areas: Tetrahedrally close-packed (TCP) phase and carbide precipitation in the base metal; TCP and carbide precipitation in welded samples; and Long-range ordering reactions. TCP-phase and carbide precipitates that form in Alloy 22 are generally rich in chromium (Cr) and/or molybdenum (Mo) (Raghavan et al. 1984 [DIRS 154707]). Because these elements are responsible for the high corrosion resistance of Alloy 22, precipitation of TCP phases and carbides, especially at grain boundaries, can lead to an increased susceptibility to localized corrosion in the alloy. These phases are brittle and also tend to embrittle the alloy (Summers et al. 1999 [DIRS 146915]). They are known to form in Alloy 22 at temperatures greater than approximately 600 C. Whether these phases also form at the lower temperatures expected in the repository during the 10, 000 -year regulatory period must be determined. The kinetics of this precipitation will be determined for both the base metal and the weld heat-affected zone (HAZ). The TCP phases (P, {mu}, and {sigma}) are present in the weld metal in the as-welded condition. It may be possible to eliminate these phases through a solution anneal heat treatment, but that may not be possible for the closure weld because the spent nuclear fuel cladding cannot be heated to more than 350 C. The effects of any stress mitigation techniques (such as laser peening or <b>solution</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treating)</b> that may be used to reduce the tensile stresses on the closure welds must also be determined. Cold-work will cause an increase in dislocation density, and such an increase in dislocation density may cause an increase in diffusion rates that control precipitation kinetics (Porter et al. 1992 [DIRS 161265]; Tawancy et al. 1983 [DIRS 104991]). Long-range order (LRO) occurs in nickel (Ni) -Cr-Mo alloys (such as Alloy 22) at temperatures less than approximately 600 C. This ordering has been linked to an increased susceptibility of Ni-Cr-Mo alloys to stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement (Tawancy et al. 1983 [DIRS 104991]). These analyses provide information on the rate at which LRO may occur in Alloy 22 under repository conditions. Determination of the kinetics of transformations through experimental techniques requires that the transformations being investigated be accelerated {{due to the fact that}} the expected service life is at least 10, 000 years. Phase transformations are typically accelerated through an increase in temperature. The rate of transformation is determined at the higher temperature and is extrapolated to the lower temperatures of interest...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of thermal pre-treatment on the formability of a precipitation-hardening aluminium alloy AA- 2024 {{has been studied}} for three different heat treatment conditions: annealed (O-temper), solution treated and quenched (W-temper) and <b>solution</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treated,</b> quenched and then cold worked (T-temper). The maximum draw angle has been determined and the geometrical accuracy of specific SPIF formed parts has been compared. It is found that the maximum forming angles of the blank formed in O-temper and W-temper conditions show a respective 41 % and 32 % increase {{to those of the}} T-temper condition (initial blank). The hardness of the material reduces significantly after annealing, while SPIF parts formed from W-temper blanks regain their initial hardness after natural aging. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{have been}} made on the {{mechanical}} properties upon thermal ageing of a sand cast antimony-modified A 356 -type Al-Si-Mg alloy. The produced alloy was <b>solution</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> at 540 oC/ 1 h then subjected to thermal ageing treatment at 180 oC for 1 - 5 h. There mechanical properties; Tensile properties, Hardness and Impact strength were used as criterion. From the results, the tensile properties and hardness increased with thermal ageing treatment. While the impact energy and elongation decreased upon ageing. The tensile properties of antimony-modified Al-Si-Mg alloy improved with ageing time and that the microstructures indicate spherodization of the silicon flakes to fine structures, which account for the improved propertie...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Effects of {{solution}} treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties in wrought Alloy 718 were investigated. For {{the improvement of}} tensile and fatigue properties of wrought Alloy 718, a modified <b>solution</b> <b>heat</b> treatment(MSHT), heating at 1000 � for 3 minutes followed by furnace cooling {{at the rate of}} 3 �/minute and holding at 985 � for 8 minutes, was proposed. This treatment was performed repeatedly 3 times and the samples were subject to the standard aging treatment. For the purpose of comparison, a standard heat treatment(SHT) was also performed. The microstructures of modified <b>solution</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> specimens showed that small spherical shaped δ-phases were precipitated without grain growth, and the amount of δ-phases was smaller than that of standard <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> specimens. However, the δ-phases of the standard heat-treated specimen showed needle-like morphologies. Tensile and low cycle fatigue tests were performed on both modified heat-treated and standard heat-treated specimens at room temperature, 350 � and 650 �. Low cycle fatigue tests on the modified <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> specimens showed promising results without reduction of strength. However, the tensile properties of modified solution treated specimens was almost the same as those of standard <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> materials both at room temperature and 650 �...|$|R
