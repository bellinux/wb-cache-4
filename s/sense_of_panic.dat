To disguise fact should be avoided and this is the challenge for public health worker during epidemic. As noted by Davis et al.

5000|$|Grass Root Model {{describes}} {{that social}} panic commonly occurs first through {{the people in}} society. The feeling that something meaningful is threatened is dispersed throughout everyone in society. This <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> not only displays itself through the people but also through {{areas such as the}} media and political groups. The media serves as a way to present the public opinion about the reality of the situation. This theory states that the media can't report concern where none originally exists. The media and politicians are merely an outlet for displaying what people are expressing. Furthermore, the media can affect the way the public sees situations. An example of this theory is how people cause social panics due to nuclear power. After the Three Mile Island accident, where there was a nuclear meltdown, people evacuated their homes even though no workers or residents living in that area were injured or killed.

40|$|A project {{presented}} to the Department of Physician Assistant of Wichita State University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Physician Assistant. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the etiology <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder. Specific objectives include comparing and contrasting the genetic versus environmental factors that contribute to the etiology <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder. Currently, there are four main theories to explain the etiology <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder: psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, and biological. Methodology: This is accomplished via a systematic review of evidence-based medicine. Search engines utilized included: MEDLINE FirstSearch, Medline PubMed, ProQuest Nursing, PsycINFO, Current Research and a bibliographic search of selected articles. Results: The best quality evidence indicates that between 40 - 60 % of the etiology <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder is due to genetics. Further, a body of good quality research states that environmental influences to the expression <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder; such as CO 2 reactivity, learned anxiety, and fear conditioning; may also be hereditable traits. Lifestyle choices, such as smoking, also play a role in the etiology <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder. The evidence-based review does not support a role for the psychodynamic theory in the etiology <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder. Conclusion: The majority <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder is due to genetics. The minority <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder etiology is best explained by the cognitive and behavioral theories on environmental factors. Such data suggest the best treatment for panic disorder patients should focus on medical therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Panic {{attacks are}} {{characterized}} with sudden attacks of anxiety with numerous somatic symptoms, such as palpitations, tachycardia, tachypnea, nausea, vertigo. The {{objective of this}} study was to analyze symptoms <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks in patients with panic disorder, especially, to determine the specific relationship of somatic and neurological symptoms <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks in boundaries of somatic systems. Material and methods. The study sample consisted of 97 patients with primary diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder, without any acute, severe and unstable somatic illness. The presence and frequency <b>of</b> symptoms <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks were estimated by the Panic Disorder Questionnaire. Results. The study results indicate that the most frequent symptoms <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks were cardiological signs (heart pounding or racing) and trembling, followed by unsteady and fainting feeling symptoms, sweating, respiratory symptoms and gastroenterological symptoms. The results of correlation analyses indicate that symptoms <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks classified into cardio-vascular, gastro-enterological, respiratory and neuro-otological systems show statistically significant correlations. Conclusion. The results of analyses <b>of</b> symptoms <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks point to their intercorrelation. This specific association of the symptoms, if they are examined on their own in the patients, could lead to false clinical manifestation of some somatic illness. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze adequately and make the proper differential diagnosis <b>of</b> patients with <b>panic</b> disorder...|$|R
