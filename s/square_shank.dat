50|$|Closely {{related to}} {{carriage}} bolts are timber bolts, meant {{for use with}} large wood planks and structures. They have a domed head that is proportionally wider {{than that of a}} carriage bolt, and instead of a <b>square</b> section of <b>shank</b> under the head, they have four sharp-cornered fillets that grip the edge of the hole in the wood to prevent rotation. They are also known as mushroom head bolts or dome head bolts. They are used to fasten wood to wood, instead of metal to wood.|$|R

50|$|The hardy tool {{is a tool}} with a <b>square</b> <b>shank</b> {{that fits}} in a hardy hole. There are many {{different}} kinds of hardy tool such as the hot cut hardy, used for cutting hot metal on the anvil; the fuller tool, used for drawing out metal and making grooves; bending jigs - and too many others to list.|$|E
50|$|Fullers {{are forming}} tools of {{different}} shapes used in making grooves or hollows. They {{are often used}} in pairs, the bottom fuller has a <b>square</b> <b>shank</b> which fits into the hardy hole in the anvil while the top fuller has a handle. The work {{is placed on the}} bottom fuller and the top is placed on the work and struck with a hammer. The top fuller is also used for finishing round corners and for stretching or spreading metal.|$|E
5000|$|Hardy tools, {{also known}} as anvil tools or bottom tools, are {{metalworking}} tools used in anvils. A hardy has a <b>square</b> <b>shank,</b> which prevents it from rotating when placed in the anvil's hardy hole. The term [...] "hardy", used alone, refers to a hot cutting chisel used in the square hole of the anvil. Other bottom tools are identified by function. Typical hardy tools include chisels and bending drifts. They are generally used with a matching top tool.|$|E
50|$|The circle cutter {{is a basic}} {{variation}} of the beam compass. There are many types of circle cutters. This cutter is used primarily to score a circular pattern in the drywall to fit over recessed lighting in the ceiling. The tool consists of a <b>square</b> <b>shank</b> with a sliding pivot that is locked into the desired location with a turn knob. The shank is graduated into 16 units and each unit is further divided into increments of one quarter. One end of the shank has a fixed cutter wheel that scores a fine line in the drywall.|$|E
5000|$|The anvil {{serves as}} a work bench to the blacksmith, where the metal to be forged is placed. Anvils may seem clunky and heavy, {{but they are a}} highly refined tool {{carefully}} shaped to suit a blacksmith's needs. Anvils are made of cast or wrought iron with a tool steel face welded on or of a single piece of cast or forged tool steel. Some anvils are made of only cast iron, and have no tool steel face. These are not real anvils, and will not serve a blacksmith as such because they are too soft. A common term for a cast iron anvil is [...] "ASO" [...] or [...] "Anvil Shaped Object". The purpose of a tool steel face on an anvil is to provide what some call [...] "Rebound" [...] as well as being hard and not denting easily from misplaced hammer blows. The term rebound means it projects some of the force of the blacksmith's hammer blows back into the metal thus moving more metal at once than if there were no rebound. A good anvil can project anywhere from 50 to 99% of the energy back into the workpiece. The flat top, called the [...] "face" [...] is highly polished and usually has two holes (but can have more or less depending on the design). The square hole is called the hardy hole, where the <b>square</b> <b>shank</b> of the hardy tool fits. There are many different kinds of hardy tools. The smaller hole is called the pritchel hole, used as a bolster when punching holes in hot metal, or to hold tools similar to how the hardy tool does, but for tools that require being able to turn a 360 degree angle such as a hold down tool for when the blacksmith's tongs cannot hold a workpiece as securely as it needs to be. On the front of the anvil there is sometimes a [...] "horn" [...] that is used for bending, drawing out steel, and many other tasks. Between the horn and the anvil face there is often a Small area called a [...] "step" [...] or a [...] "cutting table" [...] That is used for cutting hot or cold steel with chisels, and hot cut tools without harming the anvil's face. Marks on the face transfer into imperfections in the blacksmith's work.|$|E
