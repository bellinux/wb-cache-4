The control tower was demolished in 1953 and the Sommerfeld tracking reinforcement to the grass runways taken up to allow the land to be farmed again. Over a period of time the sole 'T2' and the 'Blister' hangars were removed, the last surviving Blister being blown down in the October 1987 gales (this was the hangar that Harry Roberts, a criminal who with two others murdered three police offices near Wormwood Scrubs prison in August 1966, was found hiding in after a 96-day manhunt - the longest in police history). Modern aerial shots of the airfield show the 'ghost' outlines of the reinforced grass runways, similar to what can be seen at nearby RAF Hunsdon and RAF Matching, albeit they had 'hard' surfacing.

40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2003. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 12 - 14). The {{problem of}} companion animal overpopulation in the United States {{is a serious}} issue wrought with multifaceted barriers {{standing in the way}} of complete elimination. This paper will focus on surgical sterilization as one means to control over-population. Recent studies estimate that 3 to 4 million cats are euthanized annually and these numbers do not include those unwanted animals that are left to starve or to die of trauma or exposure. One of the main reasons cited for relinquishment of animals to a humane society (36. 4 %) was that the animals were from an unwanted litter. Traditionally, shelters across the country have adopted animals out with contracts mandating that new owners spay or neuter their pets. Studies have shown that there is less than 60 % compliance with this mandate, despite preadoption screening, prepayment of surgical fees, reduced surgical fees, neuter contracts, and follow up activity by <b>shelter</b> <b>personnel.</b> Even in those households that do comply, it can be estimated that many of those cats may wander outside prior to gonadectomy to make their contribution to the overpopulation problem. Just a single pair of cats may be the progenitors of 174, 760 kittens in 7 years even if they and their offspring are not allowed to reproduce at full potential. Dr. Leslie Appe...|$|R
40|$|The {{return of}} a {{recently}} adopted companion animal places the nonhuman animal in jeopardy and may be painful and frustrating to the humans involved. However, if re-turners learn from the failed adoption experience, future adoptions may be more satis-factory for all concerned. In this study, 78 people who had adopted and returned dogs or cats to an animal shelter in a U. S. Midwestern city were interviewed regarding their rea-sons for return, reactions to the experience, and plans for future adoptions. Although some returners adjusted their pet ownership plans in potentially beneficial ways, most reacted by counseling greater forethought and planning before adopting. The last, al-though sound advice, {{had little to do}} with reasons for return, which primarily were prob-lems that arose postadoption: pet behavior such as not getting along with other pets or children. Changing expectations about the development of new pet–family relation-ships and the provision of postadoption services might help adopters tolerate the adjust-ment period and handle problems without resorting to returning the animal. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS, 2004 a) estimated that be-tween 6 million and 8 million cats and dogs enter U. S. animal shelters each year. The relinquishment of previously owned, nonhuman animals is frustrating to an-imal <b>shelter</b> <b>personnel,</b> dangerous for the animals (Olson & Moulton, 1993), and often painful for the relinquisher.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} cohort study was to investigate determinants of adoption of cats and dogs from a large municipal animal shelter. The subjects were 4, 813 cats and 3, 301 dogs impounded by the Sacramento County Department of Ani-mal Care and Regulation and offered for adoption September 9, 1994 to May 26, 1995. The study constructed models predicting the conditional probability of adop-tion using logistic regression and a final multiple logistic regression model from vari-ables found to be important predictors of adoption. Age, sex, coat color, and reason for relinquishment were major determinants of adoption in cats. Age, sex, coat color, reason for relinquishment, breed, purebred status, and injury status were major deter-minants of adoption in dogs. <b>Shelter</b> <b>personnel</b> could utilize this information to in-crease the adoption of frequently overlooked animals. Alternatively, shelters could use this to focus their resources on animals with characteristics the public prefers. Millions of dogs and cats (Carter, 1987; Rowan, 1992) are annually impounded in the United States in animal shelters. The majority of these companion animals are never adopted or reclaimed by their owners and instead must be humanely destroyed. This wholesale euthanasia of unwanted dogs and cats has been recog-nized by our society as both tragic and wasteful. Euthanasia is probably the most conspicuous and unpalatable manifestation of what has been called the “pet overpopulation problem. ” The number of dogs and cats annually euthanized in the United States has been estimated as between 5 million and 17 million nonhuman animals (Carter, 1987...|$|R
40|$|Cat {{overpopulation}} {{remains a}} problem in the Netherlands. Juvenile castration (6 - 16 weeks of age) can help facilitate adopting out young kittens which are unable to reproduce. As a result, problems with owner compliance are avoided and a shorter holding period for kittens in shelters can be achieved. While widely applied in the United States of America (USA), Dutch veterinarians seem reluctant to perform this procedure in kittens. A survey was sent to Dutch veterinarians, specialised in the field of companion animals, which showed that 21 % of Dutch veterinarians perform juvenile castration and that this procedure constitutes 9. 0 % {{of the total number of}} castrations. Similar to other western countries, the majority of veterinarians (89 %) recommends their clients to castrate cats at the ‘traditional age’ of 6 - 9 months of age [1 - 8]. Little scientific data supports this advice [9]. In addition to ethical objections, main concerns among veterinarians regarding juvenile castration are related to anaesthesia and long-term complications. However, research shows that short-term complications are similar to those in adult cats when appropriate care is taken regarding anaesthetic and surgical procedures. Many possible long term complications are either rejected or remain unproven. In the Dutch veterinary practice improvements concerning the procedure of juvenile castration can be executed especially regarding monitoring (i. e. temperature), recovery (feeding) and post operative pain management. Many veterinarians do not see juvenile castration as the right intervention to solve and prevent further overpopulation. However, there is a platform for awareness and advancement in this area since the majority of veterinarians believe there is currently overpopulation of cats and veterinarians should play a role in solving this problem. Practically applicable strategies can be created for long-term solutions regarding the current cat overpopulation. This may be achieved by creating a discussion among veterinarians, <b>shelter</b> <b>personnel,</b> researchers and the professional society for veterinary medicine...|$|R
40|$|Every year, {{thousands}} of cats are relinquished to animal shelters in Sweden {{and around the}} world. To house these solitary animals in confined environments, and {{in close proximity to}} their conspecifics, is something that can lead to issues regarding their welfare. In this study cats housed singly or in pairs were observed to investigate whether the behavioural protocol ”Cat Behaviour and Wellbeing protocol” (Cat-Be-Well) could predict how long time a cat spent at the animal shelter before adoption and whether the characteristics of a cat had any influence on this time. An accompanying literary study was conducted to determine how a cat’s environment could be adapted so that the cat would display behaviours previously associated with adoption. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the behavioural protocol used can, indeed, predict time spent at the shelter. This means that the <b>shelter</b> <b>personnel</b> will potentially be able to use the protocol to identify which cats are at risk of spending a longer time at the shelter, and thus may need extra resources. The study also shows that a cat’s characteristics might influence the adopter’s choice of cat, though it seems like the behaviour of the cat is more important. According to this study a cat that is not stressed has a better chance at getting adopted than a cat that is stressed. This means that a cat’s environment should be adapted in a manner that allows the cat to live a life that is as stress-free as possible. This can be done by modifying the cat’s surroundings, not only after its natural behaviours by adding shelves, hides, and hunting opportunities, but also to its senses. As cats have a better sense of smell, better hearing and better eyesight than humans, stimuli adapted to humans can be perceived as aversive by cats. By considering everything from the lightbulbs to the cleaning solutions from a cat’s point of view, a lot of the aversive stimuli can be removed, which leads to more comfortable cats with a greater chance for adoption...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 2012 Spotted Fever Group (SFG) Rickettsiae are {{important}} zoonoses affecting both people and dogs. Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, {{is the most}} well-known zoonotic SFG; historically in California cases were identified from Modoc plateau area but lately the annual number of cases rarely exceeds three. More recently, a distinct but related serotype and genotype to R. rickettsii, Rickettsia spp., strain 364 D (proposed name R. philipii), was identified from a tick-bite associated eschar from a northern Californian human that brought attention to SFG Rickettsia in northwestern California. Historic cases of RMSF and this recent case of 364 D raise the public health {{question as to whether}} SFG Rickettsia are more prevalent in northern California than previously reported. Also, dogs {{may play a role in}} bringing humans in contact with SFG Rickettsia or serve as sentinels for human disease. The aim of this study was to conduct a large scale survey of Lake and Mendocino County???s dog populations for infection with SFG Rickettsia where both 364 D and R. rickettsii has been shown to be endemic in the local tick population. Serologic assessment using an indirect immunofluorescence assay was used to evaluate past exposure of dogs to Rickettsia rickettsii. Real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) was used to molecularly detect the presence of the pathogen in the blood. It targeted the ompA gene that codes for an outer membrane protein A (ompA), present on all SFG Rickettsia. This gene allowed us to target all potential SFG Rickettsia that might potentially infect the local canine population. Any positive SFG Rickettsia identified were further classified by a nested PCR assay targeting an intergenic region RR 0155 -rpmB and was confirmed by sequencing. From June to September 2010, a total of 242 individual blood samples and 36 ticks were collected from dogs by veterinarians and county <b>shelter</b> <b>personnel</b> in northern California. 45 out of 242 (19 %) serum samples tested were positive with reactive titers of 1 : 64 or greater to R. rickettsii. The highest seropositivity occurred in July when compared to the other three collection months (p< 0. 05). Of all the dog samples tested, two out of 240 (0. 83 %) had detectable R. rickettsia DNA. In addition, we identified one Dermacentor occidentalis tick with SFG Rickettsia and one Dermacentor variabilis tick with R. rickettsii. This is the first time that R. rickettsii has been detected in a D. variabilis tick in California thereby adding to the known R. rickettsii positive tick species in California. Additionally, we show that R. rickettsia occurs in dogs and ticks in northern California, expanding the known geographic and host species distribution of documented R. rickettsii infections in California. This may be of public health concern given the close proximity of owners to their pets and shared peri-domestic environments. This research shows that even though the incidence of RMSF is low in California the potential risk of infection still exists and residents need to be aware of the risks in order to protect themselves and their pets...|$|R
