5|$|In August 1993, police raided Jackson's home and, {{according}} to court documents, found books and photographs in his bedroom featuring young boys {{with little or no}} clothing. Since the books were legal to purchase and own, the jury decided not to indict Jackson. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's intimate parts; a <b>strip</b> <b>search</b> revealed that Jordan had correctly claimed Jackson had patchy-colored buttocks, short pubic hair, and pink and brown marked testicles. Reportedly, Jordan had also drawn accurate pictures of a dark spot on Jackson's penis only visible when his penis was lifted. Despite differing initial internal reports from prosecutors and investigators, with reports of jurors feeling that the photos did not match the description, the DA stated his belief in a sworn affidavit that the description was accurate, along with the sheriff's photographer stating the description was accurate. A 2004 motion filed by Jackson's defense asserted that Jackson was never criminally indicted by any grand jury and that his settlement admitted no wrongdoing and contained no evidence of criminal misconduct.|$|E
5|$|Tarrare crossed Prussian lines {{under cover}} of darkness, {{disguised}} as a German peasant. Unable to speak German, he soon {{attracted the attention of}} local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside Landau. A <b>strip</b> <b>search</b> found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission. Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again refused to talk and was imprisoned. After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors. He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed, the wooden box emerged. Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be deBeauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a gallows and the noose placed around his neck. (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had {{the presence of mind to}} recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.) At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.|$|E

The court also held, however, that because this was not clearly established law prior to the court's decision, the officials involved were shielded from liability by qualified immunity.|$|E

Later that year, she played Dr. Rachel Keyes in Little Black Book and starred as Edie Miller in British drama series NY-LON. In 2005, Jones played Karen in the Stella pilot on Comedy Central and special government agent Carla Merced in the TNT police drama Wanted.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1941, {{she and her}} entourage went to the French {{colonies in}} North Africa. The stated reason was Baker's health (since she was {{recovering}} from another case of pneumonia) but the real reason was to continue helping the Resistance. From a base in Morocco, she made tours of Spain. She pinned notes with the information she gathered inside her underwear (counting on her celebrity to avoid a <b>strip</b> <b>search).</b> She met the Pasha of Marrakech, whose support helped her through a miscarriage (the last of several). After the miscarriage, she developed an infection so severe it required a hysterectomy. The infection spread and she developed peritonitis and then septicemia. After her recovery (which she continued to fall in and out of), she started touring to entertain British, French, and American soldiers in North Africa. The Free French had no organized entertainment network for their troops, so Baker and her entourage managed {{for the most part}} on their own. They allowed no civilians and charged no admission.|$|E

The album acts as Jackson's response to the media and the public. In 1993, Evan Chandler and his son Jordan Chandler accused Jackson of child sexual abuse. Jackson agreed to a <b>strip</b> <b>search</b> of his body at Neverland Ranch; the <b>strip</b> <b>search</b> was ordered by Thomas W. Sneddon Jr., the district attorney of Santa Barbara County, California. Sneddon {{was in charge of the}} investigation as a whole. The accuser gave a detailed description of what he alleges were Jackson's genitals, also giving details on patches of vitiligo on the singer's body, but eventually the description was proved wrong. In an emotional state, Jackson stood on a platform in the middle of the room, took off all his clothes and was examined for approximately twenty-five minutes; he was never physically touched.|$|E

500|$|In December 1993, Jackson {{was served}} with a warrant for a <b>strip</b> <b>search</b> of his body, as police wanted to verify Jordan Chandler's {{description}} of Jackson's private anatomy. The order stated that officers were to examine, photograph and videotape Jackson's entire body, [...] "including his penis, anus, hips, buttocks and {{any other part of}} his body". The warrant stated they were looking for discoloration or any other signs of vitiligo which he had previously spoken about, or any other skin disorder, and that refusal to comply would be used in court as an indication of guilt. The <b>strip</b> <b>search</b> took place on December 20, 1993, at Jackson's ranch. Those present for the prosecution were Santa Barbara District Attorney Tom Sneddon, a detective, a photographer and a doctor. Those present on behalf of Jackson were his two attorneys, a physician, a detective, a bodyguard and a photographer. The attorneys and Sneddon agreed to leave the room when the examination took place, and Jackson demanded that the prosecution detective should also leave, which he subsequently did. In an emotional state, Jackson stood on a platform {{in the middle of the}} room, took off all his clothes and the search lasted for approximately 25minutes, although he was never physically touched.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Toronto police raided a women's {{night at}} a bathhouse called Club Toronto.

A Pussy Palace organizer stated “any women at the event were deeply angered and traumatized”.

500|$|Although Ginsburg did not author the {{majority}} opinion, she {{was credited with}} influencing her colleagues on the case Safford Unified School District v.

In an interview published prior to the Court's decision, Ginsburg shared her view that some of her colleagues did not fully appreciate {{the effect of a}} <b>strip</b> <b>search</b> on a 13-year-old girl. As she pointed out, [...] "They have never been a 13-year-old girl." [...] In an 8–1 decision, the Court agreed that the school's search went too far and violated the Fourth Amendment and allowed the student's lawsuit against the school to go forward. Only Ginsburg and Justice Stevens would have allowed the student to sue individual school officials as well.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, she co-starred with Julia Roberts in Mona Lisa Smile in {{the role}} of Giselle. In an {{interview}} with The Daily Telegraph, she revealed the reason for accepting the role was [...] "to play somebody who feels confident in herself as a sexy, beautiful woman". The film generated mostly critical reviews, with Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times describing it as [...] "smug and reductive". Her next roles were in smaller independent films: Casa de los Babys (2003), a story about six American women impatiently waiting out their lengthy residency requirements in an unidentified South American country before picking up their adoptive babies, and Criminal (2004), a remake of the Argentinian film Nine Queens, with John C. Reilly and Diego Luna. Gyllenhaal plays an honest hotel manager forced to help her crooked brother (Reilly) by seducing one of his victims. Gyllenhaal was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2004. She starred in the HBO film <b>Strip</b> <b>Search</b> (2004), where she portrayed an American student in China suspected of terrorism.|$|E
500|$|The {{allegations}} {{also had}} an effect on the content of Jackson's music: HIStory, which was released shortly after the allegations, [...] "creates an atmosphere of paranoia," [...] according to one writer. Its content focuses on the public struggles Jackson went through just prior to its production. In the songs [...] "Scream" [...] and [...] "Tabloid Junkie", along with the ballad [...] "You Are Not Alone", Jackson directs much of his anger and personal hurt at the media. In the track [...] "D.S.", Jackson launches a verbal attack against a character who is often cited to be Tom Sneddon, the District Attorney that requested his <b>strip</b> <b>search.</b> He describes the person as an antisocial white supremacist who wanted to [...] "get my ass, dead or alive". Of the song, Sneddon said, [...] "I have not, shall we say, done him the honor of listening to it, but I’ve been told that it ends with the sound of a gunshot." [...] In the introspective ballad [...] "Stranger in Moscow", Jackson laments his [...] "swift and sudden fall from grace". He completed the video that was originally supposed to accompany Addams Family Values and released it as Ghosts; the finished video included a framing story about an eccentric maestro who entertains children and is pursued by a bigoted local official.|$|E
