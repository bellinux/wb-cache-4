The monomers chosen were butyl acrylate, 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate (EHA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and acrylic acid (AA).

Bulk effects dominated by polymer zero shear viscosity change as AA and EHA levels were varied were attributed to the observed effect on <b>static</b> shear <b>resistance</b> and the horizontal displacements of peel master-curves. <b>Static</b> shear <b>resistance</b> was found to strongly correlate with log(a(C)), a parameter introduced to horizontally shift peel master-curves to form a superposed, "super master-curve".

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the <b>static</b> frictional <b>resistance</b> at the bracket/archwire interface in two recently introduced bracket systems and {{compare them to}} conventional ceramic and conventional metal bracket systems. Three variables were considered including the bracket system, archwire type and archwire angulation. Material and Methods: Four bracket systems were tested in vitro: Self ligating ceramic, ceramic with metal slot and module, conventional ceramic with module and conventional metal with module. A specially constructed jig and an Instron testing machine were {{used to measure the}} <b>static</b> frictional <b>resistance</b> for 0. 014 inches round and 0. 018 x 0. 025 inches rectangular stainless steel wires at 0 ° and 7 ° angulations. Main outcome measures: static frictional force at the bracket/archwire interface; recorded and measured in units of force (Newtons). Results: Self ligating ceramic and metal slot ceramic bracket systems generated significantly less <b>static</b> frictional <b>resistance</b> than conventional ceramic bracket systems with the wire at both angulations (P < 0. 05). Changing the wire from 0. 014 round to 0. 018 x 0. 025 rectangular wire significantly increased frictional forces for metal slot ceramic and conventional metal bracket systems (P < 0. 01). Increasing wire angulation significantly increased frictional resistance at the bracket/archwire interface for all four types of bracket systems tested (P < 0. 001).

40|$|The {{membrane}} potential of Chara corallina Klein ex Willd, em R. D. W. displays an oscillatory behaviour {{in response to}} an applied current step. The relative amplitude and the frequency of oscillation of the overshoot increase with the strength of the current.

40|$|Styrene (S) and methyl {{methacrylate}} (MMA) copolymers were prepared with acrylates, such as butyl acrylate, 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate and acrylic acid, for application as pressure sensitive adhesives (PSA). The copolymer compositions {{were designed to}} provide constant glass transition temperature. The PSA were tested using peel adhesion <b>resistance,</b> <b>static</b> shear <b>resistance,</b> loop tack and DMA. Time-temperature-superposition (TTS) was used to construct peel resistance master curves to compare copolymers containing S and MMA, and obtain a structural interpretation of the PSA performance. The TTS master curves were combined for related copolymer series to obtain composition super master curves. The super master curve construction demonstrated the comonomer composition dependence of the PSA performance and distinguished copolymers containing S from those containing MMA. Composition related performance was exhibited by static shear and loop tack, the latter {{in relation to the}} concentration shift factors. DMA results confirmed the adhesive performance interpretations. Composition super master curves suggested differences in the relative mobility of S and MMA copolymers. Chain branching and entanglements were more significant with MMA than with S copolymers. DMA and <b>static</b> shear <b>resistance</b> confirmed the peel resistance results.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{stainless steel}} archwire static friction in active and passive self-ligating lingual and conventional brackets with second-order angulations. Methods: Two conventional lingual brackets for canines (STb light/Ormco; PSWb/Tecnident), and two self-ligating brackets, one active (In-Ovation L/GAC) {{and the other}} passive (3 D/ Forestadent), were evaluated. A stainless steel archwire was used at 0 °, 3 ° and 5 ° angulations. Metal ligatures, conventional elastic ligatures, and low friction elastic ligatures were also tested. A universal testing machine applied friction between brackets and wires, simulating sliding mechanics, to produce 2 -mm sliding at 3 mm/minute speed. Results: Two-way analysis of variance demonstrated a significant effect {{of the interaction between}} brackets and angulations (p < 0. 001). Tukey test indicated that the highest frictional resistance values were observed at 5 ° angulation for In-Ovation L, PSWb bracket with non conventional ligature, and STb bracket with metal ligature. As for 3 D, PSWb with conventional or metal ligatures, and STb brackets with non conventional ligature, showed significantly lower <b>static</b> frictional <b>resistance</b> with 0 ° angulation. At 0 ° angulation, STb brackets with metal ties, In-Ovation L brackets and 3 D brackets had the lowest frictional resistance. Conclusions: As the angulation increased from 0 ° to 3 °, <b>static</b> friction <b>resistance</b> increased. When angulation increased from 3 ° to 5 °, <b>static</b> friction <b>resistance</b> increased or remained the same. Self-ligating 3 D and In-Ovation L brackets, as well as conventional STb brackets, seem to be the best option when sliding mechanics is used to perform lingual orthodontic treatment...|$|R

Method: Twenty-two trained men were submitted to the 10 repetition maximum test and retest for leg extension, leg curl and hip adduction exercises.
