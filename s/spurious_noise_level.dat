Though the 9 -year periodicity is commonly reported, shorter periodicities is still under study. We employ the cepstrum analysis method to analyze the noisy power spectrum of the North-South asymmetry. We demonstrate that the cleaned power spectrum shows reduction of the <b>spurious</b> back-ground <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> Some of short period peaks in the power spectrum disappear after deconvolution. It should be, however, pointed out that power spectrum might look less noisy because of a filtering process during deconvolution. We conclude by pointing out that a more sophisticate filtering algorithm is required to produce a precise and reliable periodicity estimate...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to suppress the strong noise for an FMCW SAR. First, the quantitative analysis of the noise is performed. It is found that a strong <b>spurious</b> <b>noise</b> of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is introduced from interferences and significantly affects the image quality; the other noise components are sufficiently small, thus having ignorable influences. Then, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based method of noise suppression is proposed to eliminate the ADC strong <b>spurious</b> <b>noise,</b> adopting an ADC and a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Finally, using the real Ku-band FMCW SAR data, the <b>level</b> of the <b>noise</b> components is measured and the effectiveness of the proposed noise suppression method is validated. The results show that the measured <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> coincides with the theoretical <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> and the proposed noise suppression method effectively eliminates the ADC strong <b>spurious</b> <b>noise...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} cross-spectra based {{approach}} {{for the analysis}} of CMB data at large angular scales to constrain the reionization optical depth τ, the tensor to scalar ratio r and the amplitude of the primordial scalar perturbations A_s. With respect to the pixel-based approach developed so far, using cross-spectra has the unique advantage to eliminate <b>spurious</b> <b>noise</b> bias and to give a better handle over residual systematics, allowing to efficiently combine the cosmological information encoded in cross-frequency or cross-dataset spectra. We present two solutions to deal with the non-Gaussianity of the Ĉ_ℓ estimator distributions at large angular scales: the first one relies on an analytical parametrization of the estimator distribution, while the second one is based on modification of the Hamimache&Lewis likelihood approximation at large angular scales. The modified HL method (oHL) is powerful and complete. It allows to deal with multipole and mode correlations for a combined temperature and polarization analysis. We validate our likelihoods on numerous simulations that include the realistic <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> of the, -LFI and -HFI experiments, demonstrating their validity over a broad range of cross-spectra configurations.

40|$|Valuation {{of traffic}} noise {{abatement}} based on hedonic pricing {{models of the}} property market has traditionally measured the noise as the equivalent, or another average, level. What is not captured in such a noise indicator is the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of a vehicle passage. In this study, we incorporate the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in the hedonic model letting the property price depend on both the equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> and the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> Hedonic models for both rail and road noise are estimated. Data consists of characteristics of sold properties, property-specific noise calculation, and geographical variables. We use the hedonic approach to estimate the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for maximum noise abatement where we model the effect as the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> subtracted with the equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> Furthermore, we control for the equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in the estimations. The estimated results show that including the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in the model has influence on the property prices, but only for rail and not for road. This means that for road we cannot reject the hypothesis that WTP for noise abatement {{is based on the}} equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> only.

40|$|Introduction: The {{agricultural}} tractor {{is one of}} the most commonly used vehicles on farms and one of the most prominent sources of noise. This article presents an exemplary assessment of the audible and infrasonic <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in the cabins of selected modern wheeled {{agricultural tractor}}s. Materials and Methods: Operator-perceived audible and infrasonic <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in the cabins were examined for 20 types of modern tractors during typical conditions of work. The tractors had been in use for no longer than 3 years, with rated power between 96 kW and 227 kW, designed and produced by world-renowned companies. <b>Noise</b> <b>level</b> measurements were performed in accordance with PN-EN ISO 9612 : 2011 (ISO 9612 : 2009). Results: Audible <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> (A-weighted) ranged from 62. 1 to 87. 4 dB-A (average: 68. 2 to 83. 8 dB-A) for different work tasks. The factors influencing <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> include performed tasks, soil, weather conditions and the skills of individual drivers. In spectrum analysis, the highest <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> occurred at frequencies 250 Hz, 1 and 2 kHz. Infrasound <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> (G-weighted) ranged from 87. 3 to 111. 3 dB-G. The driver-experienced exposure to infrasound was found to increase significantly when the vehicle was in motion. Conclusions: Average audible <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> have no potential to adversely affect the hearing organ during tasks performed inside the closed cabins of the analysed modern agricultural tractors. Due to the relatively low audible <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> inside the cabins of modern agricultural tractors, non-auditory effects are the only adverse symptoms that can develop.
