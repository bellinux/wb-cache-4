[...] The Morning Call also published, verbatim, Amazon.com's direct response to a query by OSHA, where amazon.com detailed its response when heat conditions reach as high as 114 F, including water and ice treatment, electrolyte drinks, nutrition advice, and extended breaks in air conditioned rooms. Five days after the Morning Call article was published, Amazon stated that it had spent $2.4 million [...] "urgently installing" [...] air conditioning at four warehouses including the Breinigsville facility. However, the original investigator states that when he checked back with current employees for his September 23 follow-up story, [...] "they told him nothing had changed since his original story ran." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of services offered by a large (greater than 10, 000 full-time enrollment), suburban college/university counseling center, located in the Northeast. The goal of the evaluation specifically was to ascertain whether the operation of the center could be improved by examining the relationship between the predictor variables, such as student demographics, number of sessions, diagnosis, therapist experience, and therapeutic modality and the treatment outcomes at the center. ^ To answer the research questions, the outcome data were generated from the intake and <b>termination</b> <b>summaries</b> completed for each student seen at the Psychological Services Center by the student 2 ̆ 7 s therapist. Each intake and <b>termination</b> <b>summary</b> included the predictor variables named above. Finally, each therapist rated the client on a Likert-type scale as to the level of functioning and the level of distress at both intake and termination. ^ The results of logistic regression analyses indicate that number of sessions was a significant predictor of both improvement in functioning and reduction of distress. In addition, the presence/absence of an Axis II- disorder was a strong predictor of reduction in distress. Therapist experience was a good predictor of both improvement and functioning and reduction in distress. The use of a dynamic treatment modality was a significant predictor of reduction in distress, while the use of a cognitive-behavioral model was not a significant predictor of reduction in distress. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were also conducted for the significant models. ^ The general implications of the current study are that psychotherapy is generally effective, especially for emotionally stable students who are seeking to manage situational events in their lives. The inherently short-term nature of college counseling is sufficient to address most of these situational difficulties. Longer-term therapy should be reserved for those who have greater levels of psychopathology. Based upon the literature, counseling theory, and the outcome data of the present study, college counseling centers may better serve students with significant psychological issues by taking a stance of active referral, rather than offering them short-term treatment.

40|$|Special math {{needed to}} use results: Same Results useful to: Theoreticians and distributed-software {{developers}} <b>Summary</b> & Conclusions- <b>Termination</b> detection {{is among the}} fundamental problems encountered in distributed systems. Several papers have appeared to solve the termination detection problem where the underlying network {{does not have any}} faults. In this paper, the problem of detecting termination in a network which has at most one faulty node is considered and several message-efficient protocols are presented. The protocols are then extended to multiple node failures. The network is assumed to be connected in spite of the failures. This paper first addresses the problem of termination detec-tion in a faulty network where there can be at most one fault. For this simple case, a reliable protocol is provided for detecting ter-mination. Some optimization is performed to arrive at a protocol which is message-efficient. The protocols are easy to implement because of their simplicity and do not generate excessive number of messages. No assumptions are made about the network being synchronous. The only assumption is that node failures should be visible to some/all of the neighbors. The case of k-node failures can then be handled easily and the protocol for single node failures can be directly used with some minor modifications in a network where there may be k fail-ed nodes. No finite amount of additional hardware can make any network tolerant to all types of faults. A widely accepted ap-proach is to design hardware components with very high reliabili-ty while designing software that is also fault-tolerant. Thus, the approach here to reliability of networks is through software fault-tolerance. The network must remain connected. If the network is parti-tioned, then there are numerous interesting questions arise but they are not treated here. The protocols are being implemented on a network of SUN work stations. 1...|$|R

40|$|Section 23 of the Constitution {{provides}} {{that everyone has}} a right to fair labour practice. The constitutional right to fair labour practices includes the right not to be unfairly dismissed and is given effect to by section 185 of the LRA. The constitutional right not to be unfairly dismissed is given effect to by Chapter VIII of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 (the LRA), which provides a remedy for an unfair dismissal. Schedule 8 of the LRA contains a “Code of Good Practice: Dismissal”, which the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (the CCMA) and the Labour Courts must take into account when determining the fairness of a dismissal. The LRA expressly recognises three grounds for termination of the employment contract namely; misconduct {{on the part of the}} employee, incapacity due to an employee’s poor work performance, ill health or injury and termination due an employer’s operational requirements. In terms of the LRA, a dismissal must be procedurally and substantively fair. The requirements for procedural and substantive fairness are contained in Schedule 8 of the Code of Good Practice: Dismissal. The provisions of section 185 of the LRA apply to all employers and employees in both the public and the private sectors, with the exception of members of the National Defence Force, the National Intelligence Agency, the South African Secret Service and the South African National Academy of Intelligence. Section 213 of the LRA defines an “employee” as any person, excluding an independent contractor, who works for another person or for the State and who receives, or is entitled to receive, any remuneration and any person who in any manner assists in carrying out or conducting the business of an employer. Section 200 A of the LRA sets out the presumption as to who is an employee. This is a guideline to assist in determining who is an employee The Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 of 1997 (the BCEA) sets minimum terms and conditions of employment including the notice of termination of employment. Under the common law an employment contract of employment can be terminated on either the expiration of the agreed period of employment or on completion of the specified task in cases of fixed-term contracts. Also, in terms of general contract principles an employment contract may be terminated by notice duly given by either party or by <b>summary</b> <b>termination</b> in the event of a material breach on the part of either party. The death of either party may terminate the employment contract. However, the death of an employer will not necessarily lead to the contract’s termination. An employment contract may also terminate by operation of law or effluxion of time namely retirement and coming into being of fixed-term contracts, by mutual agreement, employee resigning, due to insolvency of the employer and due to supervening impossibility of performance. In the circumstances indicated above, the termination of the contract of employment does not constitute dismissal. This means that the CCMA and the Labour Court do not have jurisdiction to determine should the employee allege that his or her dismissal was unfair. It has been argued that the instances where a termination of a contract of employment is terminated, but there is no dismissal should be scrutinised to avoid a situation where employees are deprived of protection afforded by the fundamental right not to be unfairly dismissed. There have been some instances where employment contracts contain clauses that provide for automatic termination of employment contracts. It has been held by the courts in various decisions that such clauses are against public policy and thus invalid. The Labour Court stated that a contractual device that renders the termination of a contract something other than a dismissal is exactly the exploitation the LRA prohibits There are various court decisions providing guidelines of circumstances in which termination of employment may be regarded as not constituting dismissal. The main focus of the treatise is to discuss these instances and critically analyse the approach taken by forums like the CCMA, bargaining councils and the Labour Court in dealing with such instance...|$|E
