500|$|Full {{production}} {{began on}} Chrono Cross in mid-1998. The Chrono Cross team reached 80 members at its peak, with additional personnel of 10–20 cut-scene artists and 100 quality assurance testers. The team felt pressure {{to live up}} to the work of Chrono Triggers [...] "Dream Team" [...] development group, which included famous Japanese manga artist Akira Toriyama. Kato and Tanaka hired Nobuteru Yūki for character design and Yasuyuki Honne for art direction and concept art. The event team originally envisioned a short game, and planned a system by which players would befriend any person in a town for alliance in battle. Developers brainstormed traits and archetypes during the character-creation process, originally planning 64 characters with unique endings that could vary in three different ways per character. Kato described the character creation process: [...] "Take Pierre, for example: we started off by saying we wanted a wacko fake hero like Tata from Trigger. We also <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> 'we need at least one powerful mom', 'no way we're gonna go without a twisted brat', and so on so forth." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{sales pitch}} {{was typical of}} Wolfman Jack's growling, exuberant on-air style. [...] In the spirit of his {{character}} name, he would punctuate his banter with howls, while urging his listeners to [...] "get naked" [...] or [...] "lay {{your hands on the}} radio and squeeze my knobs". [...] Part of the persona was his nocturnal anonymity; listeners from coast to coast {{had no idea how to}} recognize the face behind the voice that <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Wolfman plays the best records in the business, and then he eats 'em!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 4, 2013, the UPP Chairwoman Lee Jung-hee {{convened a}} press conference and told reporters that {{everything}} Lee Seok-ki and RO members said at the May 12 meeting was a [...] "joke." [...] "Among the 130 attendees, {{only one or two}} of them mentioned weapons or destroying facilities, but {{it was a kind of}} a joke, and although some <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that, the others just laughed," [...] the chairwoman said. Her comments conflicted with previous ones. When the prosecution first revealed the insurrection allegation, She and other UPP members said they were [...] "fabricated" [...] and even denied that the May 12 meeting took place.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I can't say I'm extra gone on corpses,' he said, as {{they walked}} back to the Court. 'The smell of them ain't what you might call eau-de-Cologne.' The other jurymen laughed. Mr Clinton often <b>said</b> witty <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that.|$|R
6000|$|... "'In {{my young}} days,' Lady Lapith went on, 'I {{should have been}} laughed out of countenance if I'd <b>said</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that. But then in my young days souls weren't as fashionable {{as they are now}} and we didn't think death was at all poetical. It was just unpleasant.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{who would}} not rather be Helen than Homer, her face {{launching}} a thousand ships and burning the topless tower of Ilion--fairer than the evening air and simply but effectively attired in {{the beauty of a}} thousand stars? What poet has ever <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that of an old man, even of Methuselah?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Norman Reese said {{in school}} to-day {{that he would}} like to tie the Kaiser to a tree and set cross dogs to {{worrying}} him," [...] said Bruce gravely. [...] "And Emily Flagg said she would like to put him in a cage and poke sharp things into him. And they all <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that. But Mrs. Blythe"--Bruce took a little square paw out of his pocket and put it earnestly on Anne's knee--"I would like to turn the Kaiser into a good man--a very good man--all at once if I could. That is what I would do. Don't you think, Mrs. Blythe, that would be the very worstest punishment of all?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{think he}} <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> this to give courage to us three, but I don't believe we needed it, particularly. Rectus was very quiet, but I {{think that if}} he could have kept himself dry he would have been pretty well {{satisfied}} to float until daylight, for he had full faith in the captain, and was sure we should be picked up. I was pretty much of the same mind, but poor Corny was in a sad way. It was no comfort to her to tell her that we should be picked up, unless she could be assured that the same ship would pick up her father and mother. But we could say nothing positive about this, of course, although we did all that we could, in a general way, to make her feel that everything would turn out all right. She sat wrapped up in her shawl, and seldom said a word. But her eyes were wandering all over the waves, looking for a boat.|$|E
60|$|Jerry Mitchell {{received}} this homily in silence. It disposed definitely of the lurking doubt {{in his mind}} as {{to the possibility of}} this man really being Jimmy Crocker. Though outwardly convinced by the other's denial, he {{had not been able to}} rid himself till now of a nebulous suspicion. But this convinced him. Jimmy Crocker would never have <b>said</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that nor would have refused the offer of alcohol. He fell into pleasant conversation with him. His mind eased.|$|R
50|$|Mononoke (物の怪) are vengeful spirits (onryō), dead spirits (shiryō), live spirits (ikiryō), or {{spirits in}} Japanese {{classical}} literature and folk religion that were <b>said</b> to do <b>things</b> <b>like</b> possess individuals {{and make them}} suffer, cause disease, or even cause death. It is also a word sometimes {{used to refer to}} yōkai or henge ("changed beings").|$|R
5000|$|Lew Dickey, the CEO of Cumulus Media Networks, {{stated that}} it cost his company [...] "a couple of million bucks {{in the first quarter}} and a couple of million bucks in quarter two." [...] He claimed that the losses {{accounted}} for one percent of the 3.5 percent loss in revenue that Cumulus suffered over this period. He <b>said</b> <b>things</b> looked <b>like</b> they would be back to normal in June. Limbaugh announced that when his 2013 contract with Cumulus expires, he would revisit dropping the distributor, due to Dickey's repeated attempts to blame ratings problem on the Limbaugh show. In June 2013, Premiere, Limbaugh's primary distributor, stated that his advertising sales were recovering well.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Coote {{specialised}} in Kipps' artistic development. She had early {{found an}} opinion {{that he had}} considerable artistic sensibility, his remarks on her work had struck her as decidedly intelligent, and whenever he called around to see them she would show him some work of art, now an illustrated book, now perhaps a colour print of a Botticelli, now the Hundred Best Paintings, now [...] "Academy Pictures," [...] now a German art handbook and now some magazine of furniture and design. [...] "I know you like these things," [...] she used to say, and Kipps said, [...] "Oo I do." [...] He soon acquired a little armoury of appreciative sayings. When presently the Walshinghams took {{him up to the}} Arts and Crafts, his deportment was intelligent in the extreme. For a time he kept a wary silence and suddenly pitched upon a colour print. [...] "That's rather nace," [...] he said to Mrs. Walshingham. [...] "That lill' thing. There." [...] He always <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that by preference to the mother rather than the daughter unless he was perfectly sure.|$|E
50|$|To {{the parents}} of the woman, Geetha <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> “tie her up”, “get her married and send her somewhere… ” to “solve the problem”. Such {{so-called}} ‘corrective’ measures that parents have inflicted on their children, have traumatised many queer people. Geetha also asked the couple whether they “have no shame to be in love”.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{really feel}} it’s an album, {{in the sense}} that we weren’t just putting {{together}} a collection of songs. In our heads, it was like a movie we were making. By the time we made that record, they <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like,</b> ‘Push the envelope - do what you want to do,’ and ‘Don’t worry about singles, don’t worry about hits until the third or fourth record. We want you to be an album band like Pink Floyd or Zeppelin. We’re like, Are you sure?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Captain {{wanted to}} talk this over with her, and hear her account of it once more. She gave it fully, {{thinking}} he ought to know exactly how his children had acted in the matter, and wishing to explain where {{she thought she had}} made mistakes. When she had finished, he said, [...] "Thank you," [...] and considered a little while; then <b>said,</b> [...] "A <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> this brings out a great deal of character; and a new eye sometimes sees more what is in a child than those that bred him up." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{the message}} of Rudyard Kipling, that upon which he has really concentrated, {{is the only thing}} worth {{worrying}} about in him or in any other man. He has often written bad poetry, like Wordsworth. He has often <b>said</b> silly <b>things,</b> <b>like</b> Plato. He has often given way to mere political hysteria, like Gladstone. But no one can reasonably doubt that he means steadily and sincerely to say something, and the only serious question is, What is that which he has tried to say? Perhaps the best way of stating this fairly will be to begin with that element which has been most insisted by himself and by his opponents--I mean his interest in militarism. But when we are seeking for the real merits of a man it is unwise to go to his enemies, and much more foolish to go to himself.|$|R
60|$|If any {{one were}} {{to say that all}} this was a little fantastic, I should not {{contradict}} him; but I hope there is some reason in it, if reason can help the short story to greater favor, for it is a form which I have great pleasure in as a reader, and pride in as an American. If we have not excelled all other moderns in it, we have certainly excelled in it; possibly because we are in the period of our literary development which corresponds to that of other peoples when the short story pre-eminently flourished among them. But when one has <b>said</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> this, it immediately accuses one of loose and inaccurate statement, and requires one to refine upon it, either for one's own peace of conscience or for one's safety from the thoughtful reader. I am not much afraid of that sort of reader, for he is very rare, but I do like to know myself what I mean, if I mean anything in particular.|$|R

5000|$|Once {{entertaining}} {{scholarships to}} several schools, Norris quit baseball after a brawl on the field. [...] "We were playing another team one day", Norris recalled, [...] "and {{there were some}} racial comments made toward me. I was a little thrown off by it. I rushed the guy who said them, and their whole team jumped on me. I put three guys in the hospital, which was the bad thing of it. People <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like,</b> 'Maybe this guy's a troublemaker,' {{so a lot of}} my scholarships fell through.|$|E
50|$|In politics, those {{aligned with}} the Roman Catholic clergy in Quebec were known as les bleus (the blues). They formed a curious {{alliance}} with the staunchly monarchist and pro-British Anglicans of English Canada (often members of the Orange Order) to {{form the basis of}} the Canadian Conservative Party. The Reform Party, which later became the Liberal Party, was largely composed of the anti-clerical French Canadians, known as les rouges (the reds) and the non-Anglican Protestant groups. In those times, right before elections, parish priests would give sermons to their flock where they <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> Le ciel est bleu et l'enfer est rouge ("Heaven/the sky is blue and hell is red").|$|E
5000|$|A double {{nomination}} in two very distinct {{categories such as}} R&B and Gospel points to her broad and unique approach to music. She is able to combine biblically based lyrics with infectious dance tracks such that the appeal is quite diverse. Eartha credits her label with fostering this unique approach, something {{that may not have}} been possible at a larger and more traditional label. She notes that her label affords her the opportunity to produce her own work without artistic restrictions. [...] Joseph Breuer, who engineered John Carpenter’s Vampires Movie Score and Soundtrack, IMX’s Introducing IMX, Keith Washington’s KW, Rhasaan Patterson’s Love in Stereo, and B.B. King’s Deuces Wild, <b>said,</b> “The <b>thing</b> I <b>like</b> about Eartha is that she doesn’t have to make it sound good through production because she does sound good.” ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not that}} Owen had not <b>said</b> the <b>like</b> <b>things</b> to her many times before; it was his eagerness and fervour that gave her an uncomfortable feeling. She was not {{sure that he was}} not {{laughing}} at her by putting on these devoted airs, and she felt herself grown up enough {{to put an end to}} being treated as a child. He made her a profound bow in a mockery of acquiescence, and preserved absolute silence during the first figures, but she caught his eye several times gazing on her with looks such as another might have interpreted into mingled regret and admiration, but which were to her simply discomfiting and disagreeable, and when he spoke again, it was not in banter, but half in sadness. 'Phoebe, how do you like all this?' ...|$|R
60|$|Everything seemed strange to-day. Everyone <b>said</b> queer, {{unexpected}} <b>things.</b> It was <b>like</b> a dream.|$|R

5000|$|Barney {{described}} the beings as generally similar to Betty's hypnotic (not dream) recollection. The beings often stared into his eyes, said Barney, with a terrifying, mesmerizing effect. Under hypnosis, Barney <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "Oh, those eyes. They're {{there in my}} brain" [...] (from his first hypnosis session) and [...] "I was told to close my eyes because I saw two eyes coming close to mine, and I felt like the eyes had pushed into my eyes" [...] (from his second hypnosis session) and [...] "All I see are these eyes... I'm not even afraid that they're not connected to a body. They're just there. They're just up close to me, pressing against my eyes." ...|$|E
5000|$|We did two {{versions}} of [...] "Circles," [...] which were both identical because they were both copies of my demo. Shel Talmy put in a High Court injunction, saying there was copyright in the recording. In other words, if you're a record producer and you produce a song with a group, and you make a creative contribution, then you own that sound....He {{took it to the}} high-court judge and he <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> 'And then on bar thirty-six I suggested to the lead guitarist that he play a diminuendo, forget the adagio, and play thirty-six bars modulating to the key of E flat,' which was all total bullshit -- he used to fall asleep at the desk… ...|$|E
5000|$|Howard {{was charged}} with second-degree murder and pleaded self-defense. Fitzpatrick's alleged use of racial epithets was denied by Howard's wife in the {{resulting}} trial. But she did testify that he <b>said</b> [...] "Doing <b>things</b> <b>like</b> this has set your race back five years." [...] Howard testified that he angrily cursed at Fitzpatrick and {{that led to the}} altercation. The widow, Mary Fitzpatrick, testified that a security guard separated the two men during the scuffle but Howard then pulled a knife from his jacket and lunged at Fitzpatrick with it. Howard and witnesses testified that while Howard was pinned against the wall, a woman handed him a nail file which he used to stab Fitzpatrick. But the nail file was never recovered and the unidentified woman never came forward. According to the jury foreman, Jack Petro, [...] "the issue of race did not come up as a factor in the jury room." [...] After a long deliberation, Howard was convicted of manslaughter and received a sentence of 1-to-25 years in prison. After 11 months, Howard was paroled for good behavior. Howard had no previous criminal record before the incident. He and his wife divorced shortly after his release from prison.|$|R

5000|$|Constance Ahrons, who has {{published}} books suggesting {{there may be}} positive effects for children, interviewed 98 divorced families' children for We're Still Family: What Grown Children Have to Say About Their Parents' Divorce.Since by definition all children of divorced parents had lived in unhappy homes, they unsurprisingly reported numerous unhappy experiences. Numerous subjects <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "I {{saw some of the}} things my parents did and know not to do that in my marriage and see the way they treated each other and know not to do that to my spouse and my children. I know divorce has made me more committed to my husband and my children." [...] Ahron's method of asking adult children of divorce how they feel about it also has the well-known weaknesses of [...] "self-report" [...] studies.|$|E
5000|$|In a Guns & Ammo review, Wiley Clapp said, [...] "Ingenuity {{is often}} {{nothing more than}} a {{combination}} of existing principles applied in unique ways. Kel-Tec's new P-3AT has no single feature that is not established in modern pistol design, yet it has no competition in its niche." [...] Since Ruger's introduction of its LCP pocket pistol, some reviewers have characterized the Ruger offering as comparable to the P-3AT. Other reviewers such as Gun-tests.com have <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Ruger had simply copied the Kel-Tec 380's design..."Kahr Arms has introduced a similar pistol, the Kahr P380, that sells for significantly more. At the 2010 SHOT Show, Smith & Wesson introduced their S&W [...]380 Bodyguard and Taurus introduced the 738 TCP. SIG Sauer offers the P238 with an all-metal frame in competition to those mostly plastic-framed pistols.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2007, {{a long-standing}} {{debate over the}} University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's dancing Chief Illiniwek mascot {{intensified}} after racist remarks about Native Americans were discovered on a pro-mascot Facebook group. The group, entitled [...] "If They Get Rid of the Chief, I'm Becoming a Racist," [...] contained wall posts by students that <b>said</b> <b>things</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "What they don't realize is that {{there never was a}} racist problem before...but now I hate redskins and hope all those drunk casino owning bums die." [...] Another student directed a post towards a particularly vocal Native American grad student, saying, [...] "I say we throw a tomahawk into her face."
