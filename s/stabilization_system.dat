5|$|One E {{aircraft}} (AF Serial No. 56-0632) {{was modified}} as a testbed for various B-52 systems. Redesignated NB-52E, the aircraft was fitted with canards and a Load Alleviation and Mode <b>Stabilization</b> <b>system</b> (LAMS) which reduced airframe fatigue from wind gusts during low level flight. In one test, the aircraft flew 10knots (11.5mph, 18.5km/h) {{faster than the}} never exceed speed without damage because the canards eliminated 30% of vertical and 50% of horizontal vibrations caused by wind gusts.|$|E
25|$|Type 70 - Rebuild Type 62 {{and like}} the Type 62-I it is fitted with an {{external}} double lens laser range finder mounted above the mantlet of the 85mm Type 62-85TC rifled main gun but without the shield around the AA HMG. It also has improved sights and a gun <b>stabilization</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|Little {{detail about}} the <b>stabilization</b> <b>system</b> is recorded. It is known that the {{horizontal}} tail surfaces were hinged to allow the dihedral to change and that such motions were coupled to lift-changing flaps. Together, these stabilized pitch. The wing tips could rotate to control roll. The system was pneumatically powered and could be turned on and off in flight to test its efficiency.|$|E

25|$|During the {{conversion}} {{there were no}} major hull or engineering changes made other than installation of a roll <b>stabilization</b> <b>system.</b> However, extensive alterations were accomplished in the superstructure and hold areas so as to accommodate the Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) Weapons System. Observation Island departed her homeport of Norfolk 3 January 1959, underwent shakedown at Guantanamo Bay, and then operated on the Atlantic Missile Range off Cape Kennedy, conducting dummy missile launches and communications tests.|$|E
25|$|T-72MP: This {{modernization}} {{package was}} unveiled in 1997 by KMDB and includes an improved 6TD-1 engine, Kontakt-5 or Nozh ERA, a modern {{fire suppression system}} and an advanced Sagem SAVAN 15MP fire control system with the multi-channel thermal SAVAN 15MP (gunner) and panoramic SFIM VS580 (commander) sights. But {{the capabilities of the}} FCS were not fully utilized since the tank retained the obsolete 2E42-2 <b>stabilization</b> <b>system</b> and 2A46M main gun. The upgrade is offered jointly with Sagem of France, and PSP Bohemia of the Czech Republic.|$|E
25|$|The BM-354P High Velocity Armor Piercing (HVAP) round has {{a maximum}} {{effective}} range of 650 meters by day and 600 meters at night. Its maximum aimed range is 1,060 meters. It can penetrate 127mm of armour at muzzle and 50mm at 1,000 meters. The armour-piercing round can pierce 60mm of armor inclined at 60 degrees {{from a range of}} 2,000 meters. The BK-350M High Explosive Anti Tank or HEAT round has a {{maximum effective range}} of 650 meters by day and 600 meters at night. Its maximum range is 1,000 meters. It can penetrate 280mm of armour at 1,000 meters. The OF-350 Frag-HE round has a maximum effective range of 600 meters at night and a maximum range of 4,000 meters. The gun can be fired while the vehicle is afloat. The gun can also be depressed and elevated between −4 and +30 degrees so like most Soviet tanks, the PT-76 has a limited ability to depress its main gun, and therefore can have difficulty finding a hull down fire position on higher ground. One of the greatest disadvantages of the gun used on the PT-76 Model 1 was that it had no <b>stabilization</b> <b>system</b> and therefore couldn't be effectively fired while the vehicle was on the move. The PT-76 Model 2 has a 1-axis <b>stabilization</b> <b>system</b> and the PT-76B has a 2-axis system.|$|E
40|$|To fully {{characterize}} the luminosity {{performance of a}} linear collider, {{it is important to}} simulate the effects of ground motion as well as the beam-beam feedback and other <b>stabilization</b> <b>systems</b> planned to compensate for that motion. The linear collider simulation codes have recently been extended to include both ground motion models and <b>stabilization</b> <b>systems</b> to support the work of the International Linear Collider Technical Review Committee (TRC) [1].

40|$|Spinal rigid {{instrumentations}} {{have been}} used to fuse and stabilize spinal segments as a surgical treatment for various spinal disorders to date. This technology provides immediate stability after surgery until the natural fusion mass develops. At present, rigid fixation is the current gold standard in surgical treatment of chronic back pain spinal disorders. However, such systems have several drawbacks such as higher mechanical stress on the adjacent segment, leading to long-term degenerative changes and hypermobility that often necessitate additional fusion surgery. Dynamic <b>stabilization</b> <b>systems</b> have been suggested to address adjacent segment degeneration, which {{is considered to be a}} fusion-associated phenomenon. Dynamic <b>stabilization</b> <b>systems</b> are designed to preserve segmental stability, to keep the treated segment mobile, and to reduce or eliminate degenerative effects on adjacent segments.

25|$|T-72AG: Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau (KMDB) {{modernization}} package {{aimed at}} improving the automotive and firepower capabilities of the tank with components mostly derived from the T-80UD program, including an improved 6TD-1 engine rated at 1,000hp or 1,200hp (881kW) 6TD-2, new drivetrain components from the T-80UD, an improved engine cooling system, turbocharger and air filter. These upgrades improve upon the T-72B tank's mobility and bring the upgraded vehicle up to par with the high performance T-80UD. Further improvements {{were made to the}} fire control system, which is now an adaptation of the 1A45 Irtysh system, with 1G46 day sight, TKN-4S, TPN-4 or TPN-4 Buran-Catherine nights sights (the latter equipped with thermal viewer) which also enables firing 9M119M Invar laser-guided missiles launched from the main gun. The tank turret was covered in Kontakt-5 ERA tiles and the main gun was upgraded to the newer 2A46M1 variant, and coupled with a significantly more precise 2E42M main gun <b>stabilization</b> <b>system.</b> However, with most of the tank's components reliant upon the T-80UD—which is not in service anywhere outside of Russia and Ukraine—this variant has not had any export success.|$|E
25|$|PT-76B (Ob'yekt 740B, 1959) - PT-76 {{armed with}} the D-56TS 76.2mm rifled tank gun (double-baffle muzzle brake, {{cartridge}} ejector, fume extractor and STP-2P 'Zarya' 2-axis <b>stabilization</b> <b>system),</b> the PAZ (protivo-atomnaya zashchita) NBC protection system, an automatic fire extinguishing system, improved TShK-2-66 sight, a filtration-ventilation system, improved observation devices, improved electric equipment, a new V-6B 6-cylinder 4-stroke in line water-cooled diesel engine developing 263hp (196kW) at 1800rpm and additional internal fuel tanks for which {{the shape of the}} armour had to be slightly changed. These additional internal fuel tanks increased the fuel capacity from 250 l to 400 l. The new engine is the same as that used in one bank of that fitted to the T-54. With the new engine and additional fuel tanks, the range of the vehicle has been increased to 480km on the road, (590km with external fuel tanks) and 120km on the water. The 76.2mm D-56TS rifled tank gun can fire a new undercaliber AP projectile piercing up to 75mm at 60° from 2,000 meters. One such round has been added to a PT-76B typical ammunition load and so it can now carry 41 rounds. It was produced between 1959–1967.|$|E

500|$|To {{improve the}} tank's firepower, the gun mount around the loader's turret hatch was {{modified}} {{to allow the}} installation of a 12.7-millimeter (0.5in) machine gun, while the main gun's firepower was augmented through {{the introduction of the}} new CETME437A armor-piercing, fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS). [...] The gun's accuracy was improved through the installation of the new Mark9 modification A/D fire control system, designed by Hughes Aircraft Company. [...] The new system allowed firing during the day and during night operations, and increased the likelihood of a first round impact. [...] The fire control system was also modernized through the exchange of the old M282 gunner's periscope with a new periscope and a new [...] laser rangefinder. [...] A new ballistics computer, the NSC-800, was issued, as well as a new digital panel for the gunner, designed and manufactured by the Spanish company INISEL. [...] The tank commander also received a control unit that allowed the choice of ammunition for the gun and provided information on the ballistics of the round and the target to be engaged. [...] As a result, the loader received a presentation unit to display information on which round to load into the gun's breech and to communicate ballistic data received, including angular velocity, wind velocity, gun elevation and vehicle inclination. [...] The fire control system also allowed for the future upgrade to a more sophisticated <b>stabilization</b> <b>system</b> for the tank's main gun. [...] Survivability improvements included the addition of new steel side-skirts, a new smoke generating system linked to the engine and a new fire suppression system.|$|E
