The influence of this <b>severe</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> on ductility and strength of the composite is investigated. The behavior of the composite material seems to be governed, on one side, by the damage due to the thermal cycles and, on the other side, by the matrix self-healing and late hydration due to the permanence in water of the specimens.

40|$|When {{organizations}} that have survived traumatic reversals – for example, product failures, ethical scandals or market disruption – attempt turnarounds, they usually seek a fresh start, adopting a new strategy and installing new leadership. But if this new initiative doesn’t work and the firms continue to suffer from chronic under performance, the cause could be “transgenerational response,” a potentially crippling long-term condition stemming from the trauma {{that occurred in the}} past (see the cases of AIG and Yahoo). Transgenerational response syndrome is well known in medical and biological research. The term describes a <b>severe</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> that creates a negative adaptive response in an organism. The response is transmitted to future generations and adversely influences their development and health. Healthcare research has identified, for example, adverse transgenerational effects of inadequate maternal nutrition, which harms the development and health of future generations. Even traumatic experiences can cause both physical and psychological consequences for several generations of descendants of survivors. One of the most illuminating studies into transgenerational response was an examination of the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in babies of mothers exposed during pregnancy to the World Trade Center attack in 2001. [1] The study concluded that the effects of maternal PTSD, {{as a result of this}} catastrophic event, were passed on to their babies.

Open sights also take much more time to use—the buckhorn type is the slowest, patridge, 'U' and 'V' type notch sights are only a bit quicker; only the express sight is relatively fast. In addition, open sights tend to block out the lower portion of the shooter's field of view by nature, and because of the depth of field limitations of the human eye, do not work as well for shooters with less than perfect vision.|$|E
40|$|Exploratory {{drilling}} on {{the eastern}} Canadian continental shelf has proven the presence of commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons. Any process to extract the resources from beneath the seafloor offshore Newfoundland and Labrador has {{to take into account}} the <b>severe</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> some of which are unique to this geographic region. Damage to seafloor installations such as pipelines of wellheads by bottom dragging or scouring icebergs is one of the potential problems. This has been recognized since the early 1970 ’s. However, methods of estimating the maximum iceberg scour depths and methods of protecting seabed installations are still topics of research. [...] In this thesis an experimental approach was taken to physically model the iceberg scour process in a 14 m x 3 m x 1 m towing tank. Cohesionless soil at a uniform slope and with controlled properties was used as the representative seafloor material. Iceberg models 500 mm wide and a pipeline model 122 mm diameter were instrumented and used in a text programme aimed primarily at examining the interaction of the iceberg model and the soil and delineating the influence of the scour process below the incision depth. [...] For a horizontally scouring iceberg the frontal soil resistance was found to be the major affecting the scour size. The shape of the iceberg keel in contact with the soil was also found to be an important parameter in the scour process. The tests indicate that the zone of soil disturbance extends below the keel of the scouring iceberg. This zone of influence should be accounted for in the design of all buried installations in the Newfoundland and Labrador offshore region...|$|R

50|$|ESMexpress is a {{very compact}} computer-on-module (COM) standard. It is a {{complete}} processor module that currently supports several low-power Intel and PowerPC platforms. Apart from a CPU component, every module also includes memory {{and a range of}} serial communication interfaces such as PCI Express, Gigabit Ethernet, USB, SATA, SDVO, LVDS and HD audio. These interfaces are defined in the form factor's specification, and signals are assigned to two 120-pin connectors. This fixed pin mapping ensures that different ESMexpress modules can be exchanged more easily. Consequently, ESMexpress typically does not have an onboard FPGA. The idea behind this is to implement very specialized functions in an FPGA on the COM's carrier board to ease upgrades of the system CPU through exchange of the ESMexpress module. The ESMexpress standard includes only one form factor: 95 x 125 mm. The most important specialty of this computer-on-module is its surrounding mechanical concept, which was designed for especially <b>severe</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions,</b> for example in railway or avionics, or in the automation industry. The large temperature ranges prevalent in such fields of use are met by the modules through a cooling concept that does not need a fan for the CPU: the computer board is embedded into an aluminum frame and cover that can lead the heat off the processor by conduction cooling. At the same time this mechanical set-up provides stability to withstand vibration, but also electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).|$|E
40|$|Engineered {{cementitious}} composite's (ECC) tensile ductility and microcracking {{behavior are}} essential for achieving structural durability (for example, corrosion resistance). This paper investigated ECC's durability in terms of maintaining its unique tensile characteristics under combined mechanical loading and aggressive chloride conditions. ECC specimens were preloaded to 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 % tensile strain levels; immersed in chloride solution for 30, 60, and 90 days; and reloaded until failure. This study revealed that the reloaded specimens retained multiple microcracking behavior and tensile strain capacity greater than 2. 5 %, while the average crack width increased from 50 µm to 100 µm. Self-healing in ECC under chloride exposure is evident in terms of recovery of initial material stiffness and tensile strain capacity. Subsequent studies at the microstructure scale explained the macroscopic composite behavior. These results indicated that under <b>severe</b> marine <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions,</b> ECC remains durable and provides reliable tensile ductility and crack-controlling capability to prevent the localized cracking failure often observed in concrete structures...|$|R
40|$|Severe {{thunderstorms}} comprise {{an extreme}} class of deep convective clouds and produce high-impact weather such as destructive surface winds, hail, and tornadoes. This study addresses {{the question of}} how severe thunderstorm frequency in the United States might change because of enhanced global radiative forcing associated with elevated greenhouse gas concentrations. We use global climate models and a high-resolution regional climate model to examine the larger-scale (or “environmental”) meteorological conditions that foster severe thunderstorm formation. Across this model suite, we find a net increase during the late 21 st century in the number of days in which these <b>severe</b> thunderstorm <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> (NDSEV) occur. Attributed primarily to increases in atmospheric water vapor within the planetary boundary layer, the largest increases in NDSEV are shown during the summer season, in proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coastal regions. For example, this analysis suggests a future increase in NDSEV of 100 % or more in locations such as Atlanta, GA, and New York, NY. Any direct application of these results to the frequency of actual storms also must consider the storm initiation...|$|R
