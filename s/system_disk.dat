In these publications, the four authors proposed that after the dissipation of the gas and dust of the primordial Solar <b>System</b> <b>disk,</b> the four giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) were originally found on near-circular orbits between ~5.5 and ~17 astronomical units (AU), much more closely spaced and compact than in the present. A large, dense disk of small, rock and ice planetesimals, their total about 35 Earth masses, extended from the orbit of the outermost giant planet to some 35 AU.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{parallel}} <b>disk</b> <b>systems</b> have increasingly become popular for data-intensive applications running on high-performance computing platforms. Conservation {{of energy in}} parallel <b>disk</b> <b>systems</b> has a strong impact {{on the cost of}} cooling equipment and backup powergeneration. This is because a significant amount of energy is consumed by parallel disks in highperformance computing centers. Although a wide range of energy conservation techniques have been developed for <b>disk</b> <b>systems,</b> research on reliability analysis for energy-efficient parallel <b>disk</b> <b>systems</b> is still in its infancy. In this paper, we make use of a Markov process to develop a quantitative reliability model for energy-efficient parallel <b>disk</b> <b>systems</b> using data mirroring. With the new model in place, a reliability analysis tool is developed to efficiently evaluate reliability of fault-tolerant parallel <b>disk</b> <b>systems</b> with two power modes. More importantly, the reliability model makes it possible to provide a good compromise between energy efficiency and reliability in energy-efficient and fault-tolerant parallel <b>disk</b> <b>systems.</b> 1...|$|R

In {{this paper}} we study data {{replication}} in a mirrored <b>disk</b> <b>system.</b> Free <b>disk</b> space is exploited by keeping replicas of specific cylinders at appropriate disk locations.

40|$|Performance of disk I/O schedulers is {{affected}} by many factors, such as workloads, file <b>systems,</b> and <b>disk</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Disk</b> scheduling performance can be improved by tuning scheduler parameters, such as the length of read timers. Scheduler performance tuning is mostly done manually. To automate this process, we propose four self-learning disk scheduling schemes: Change-sensing Round-Robin, Feedback Learning, Per-request Learning, and Two-layer Learning. Experiments show that the novel Two-layer Learning Scheme performs best. It integrates the workload-level and request-level learning algorithms. It employs feedback learning techniques to analyze workloads, change scheduling policy, and tune scheduling parameters automatically. We discuss schemes to choose features for workload learning, divide and recognize workloads, generate training data, and integrate machine learning algorithms into the Two-layer Learning Scheme. We conducted experiments to compare the accuracy, performance, and overhead of five machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine Algorithms. Experiments with real-world and synthetic workloads show that selflearning disk scheduling can adapt {{to a wide variety}} of workloads, file <b>systems,</b> <b>disk</b> <b>systems,</b> and user preferences. It outperforms existing disk schedulers by as much as 15. 8 % while consuming less than 3 %- 5 % of CPU time...|$|R
