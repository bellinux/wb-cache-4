40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to solo/accompaniment separation from stereophonic music recordings which extends a monophonic algorithm we recently proposed. The solo part is modelled using a source/filter model to which we added two contributions: an explicit smoothing strategy for the filter frequency responses and an unvoicing model to catch the stochastic parts of the solo voice. The accompaniment is modelled as a general instantaneous mixture of several components leading to a Nonnegative Matrix Factorization framework. The stereophonic signal is assumed to be the instantaneous mixture of the solo and accompaniment contributions. Both channels are then jointly used within a Maximum Likelihood framework to estimate all the parameters. Three rounds of parameter estimations are necessary to sequentially estimate the melody, the voiced part and at last the unvoiced part of the solo. Our tests show that there is a clear improvement from a monophonic reference system to the proposed <b>stereophonic</b> <b>system,</b> especially when including the unvoicing model. The smoothness of the filters does not provide the desired improvement in solo/accompaniment separation, but may be useful in future applications such as lyrics recognition. At last, our submissions to the Signal Separation Evaluation Campaign (SiSEC), for the “Professionally Produced Music Recordings ” task, obtained very good results...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic echo cancellers {{are used}} in {{teleconferencing}} systems {{in order to reduce}} undesired echoes due to coupling between microphones and loudspeakers. <b>Stereophonic</b> <b>systems</b> provide more realistic experience than single-channel systems, since listeners have spatial information that helps to identify the speaker position. Assuming this scenario, a suitable choice of the system parameters becomes essential to improve the audio reproduction quality. Error-driven optimization strategies are usually used for obtaining the optimal system configuration but there is no relationship with the quality desired by the user. In this paper, an interactive evolutionary algorithm is adopted for a stereophonic acoustic echo cancellation system in order to meet subjective specifications in the optimization stage. In this way, the optimal system configuration is derived according to a user-driven approach in order to satisfy the quality requirements demanded by users availing such <b>stereophonic</b> <b>systems.</b> Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed interactive architecture according to both objective and subjective measures...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic echo {{cancellation}} for <b>stereophonic</b> <b>systems</b> derived from pairwise panning of monophonic speech M. J. Reed, M. O. Hawksford and P. Hughes Abstract: An algorithm is introduced that performs stereophonic acoustic {{echo cancellation}} (SAEC) for systems using pairwise panning {{of a single}} monophonic source to provide the effect of spatialisation. The technique exploits the inherent high correlation between the loudspeaker signals, unlike other general SAEC techniques, which try to utilise any small uncorrelated features in the signals. The algorithm maintains a single aggregate echo path estimate that is updated using normalised least mean square (NLMS) and the knowledge of {{any change in the}} spatialisation. Consequently, it achieves a computational complexity that is of the same order as a single channel NLMS algorithm. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{linearization}} technique for <b>stereophonic</b> reproduction <b>systems</b> with nonlinearity {{by using the}} MINT and Volterra filters. In the proposed technique, the linearization is achieved by incorporat-ing Volterra filters into the MINT, which can realize exact linear inverse filtering. The linearization perfor-mance of the proposed technique is consequently very high. The proposed technique can simultaneously lin-earize two loudspeaker <b>systems</b> in the <b>stereophonic</b> re-production <b>systems,</b> also. On the other hand, the con-ventional linearization technique for monaural reproduc-tion systems cannot realize exact linear inverse filtering. The linearization performance consequently deteriorates remarkably. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique has about 20 dB higher performance than the conventional one. The proposed technique also has smaller computational complexity than the conven-tional one. ...|$|R

40|$|In this Master’s Thesis {{a two-way}} {{multichannel}} audio communication system is introduced. The {{aim is to}} create a virtual acoustic window between two rooms, providing correct spatial localization of multiple audio sources on both sides. Extending monophonic communication systems to feature multichannel sound capture and reproduction increases the intelligibility of speech and the accuracy of source localization achieved with the system. Adding multiple channels to the system also increases the complexity of the acoustic echo cancellation. Methods known from <b>stereophonic</b> <b>systems</b> extend to multichannel systems. By using arrays of microphones and loudspeakers it becomes possible to try to recreate a part of the acoustic wave field existing in the recording space. A method for achieving this is wave field synthesis (WFS). To solve the acoustic feedback problem, a 48 channel acoustic echo canceller was implemented. To maximize the achieved echo attenuation, a combination of adaptive and static filters were used. The implementation provided a stable solution that made normal conversation through the window possible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The strong {{cross-correlation}} {{that exists}} between the two input audio channels makes the problem of stereophonic acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) complex and challenging to solve. Recently, two new implementations of the LMS/Newton al-gorithm that uses a linear decorrelation technique were proposed. This method helps {{to mitigate the effect}} of the ill-conditioned problem on the convergence rate of the LMS/Newton adaptive algorithm. The complexity of these algorithms is significantly lower than the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm, which is known to provide excellent echo cancellation. Furthermore, unlike the various versions of the RLS algorithm, the LMS/Newton algorithm is more robust to numerical errors. It has also been suggested that applying nonlinearities to signals at the two audio channels will help to alleviate the misalignment problem of stereo-phonic AEC systems. Simulation studies reveal that application of certain classes of nonlinearities to the two-channel LMS/Newton algorithms helps to further reduce the misalignment but it also leads to an unexpected and significant reduction in the rate of convergence of the mean-square error. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we provide an analysis of the two-channel LMS/Newton algorithm that was proposed in our earlier work. Second, we provide a theoretical understanding for the appearance of the slow modes of convergence in the presence of nonlinearities and show that they can be resolved through a preprocessing step.

40|$|In {{stereophonic}} listening, {{a realistic}} perception of distance is often lacking. The {{distance to the}} reproduced sound sources is normally {{the same as the}} distance to the loudspeakers.

5000|$|Introduced as a [...] "directional sound system" [...] {{rather than}} a true <b>stereophonic</b> sound <b>system,</b> Perspecta did not use {{discretely}} recorded sound signals. Instead, three sub-audible tones at 30 Hz, 35 Hz, and 40 Hz are mixed appropriately and embedded in a monaural optical soundtrack, {{in addition to the}} audible sound. When run through a Perspecta integrator, depending on whenever each tone is present, the audio is fed into a left (30 Hz), center (35 Hz) and right (40 Hz) speaker. Unlike true stereophonic sound, which would be described as discrete tracks running in synchronization in time and phase, Perspecta merely panned a mono mix across various channels. Because of this, only isolated dialog or sound effects could be mixed to be directional. Mixed sound effects, dialog and music could not be suitably mixed. Aside from panning, Perspecta controlled gain levels for each channel through the amplitude of each control signal.|$|R
