5|$|In 1868, Thomas Huxley {{published}} On {{the animals}} which are most nearly intermediate between birds and reptiles, making a <b>strong</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> the bird-dinosaur ancestral link. Huxley's proposal that birds arose from dinosaurs – {{based primarily on}} his observation of the similarities between Archaeopteryx and Compsognathus – remained respectable and widespread in the paleontological community until the publication of The Origin of Birds. Heilmann {{more than anyone else}} was responsible for a widespread rejection of the dinosaur-bird link. His conclusions involved more than the mere rejection of a dinosaurian ancestry for birds, however: for instance, he favored the arboreal origin of avian flight, he allied birds firmly with reptiles instead of mammals, and he was responsible for finally putting an end to the idea that birds descended from pterosaurs. Several aspects of his research have continued to be influential long after its publication.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius' {{first version}} of the Chronicon was written in 303, and his second in the mid-320s; Jerome's revision, {{translation}} and continuation dates to 380. The original Greek is lost; it is largely through Jerome's Latin and through an Armenian translation unrelated to Jerome that {{the substance of the}} original survives. Eusebius' original did cover Philip's rule—Jerome's continuation of the Chronicon only covers the period from 325 to 378—but the sections regarding Philip's Christianity do not survive in the Armenian translation. In the Armenian, all references to Arabs are omitted. Philip's celebration of the millennium is preserved, while his supposed Christianity is only implied in the entry on Decius' persecution. Jerome's Chronicon is, therefore, the nearest we can get to Eusebius' early statements on Philip's Christianity. That Jerome calls Philip primus in the Chronicon thus admits of two interpretations: either he found it in Eusebius, or he added it independently, based on other sources available to him. Shahîd argues that, while the text would offer a <b>strong</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> Philip's Christianity either way, the former interpretation is more plausible. Shahîd believes that primus appeared in Eusebius {{first version of}} the Chronicon, but may have been edited out for the second version—by the mid 320s, Eusebius had become Constantine's panegyrist, and was understandably loath to praise his subject's ignoble predecessors.|$|E

25|$|On March 17, 1994, Stanfa and 23 of his {{men were}} arrested on {{racketeering}} related chargers. This was the second major indictment on the crime family in seven years. The Federal case was the largest prosecution of an organized crime group in Philadelphia history. The second major indictment against the crime family was another <b>strong</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> the prosecution. A key piece of evidence was two years of recorded conversations Stanfa would have with mobsters in his attorney's office and doctor's office. Believing attorney–client privilege and doctor-patient confidentiality would protect him, Stanfa openly talked about important Mafia business with his men. However, the FBI {{was able to get}} a warrant to place covert listening devices in both offices once they figured out they were being used to aid criminal conspiracies. The secretly recorded conversations implicated Stanfa and his men of many criminal acts. The star witness at the trial was John Veasey, who was recruited by Stanfa to fight in the war against Merlino and eventually was inducted into the family. Before this, Veasey had no connection to the Mafia or organized crime.|$|E
25|$|Kisenosato {{produced}} an 11–4 record in his debut ōzeki tournament in January 2012. In the May 2012 tournament he {{was leading the}} yūshō race after twelve days, the first Japanese born wrestler to do so at that stage since Tochiazuma in 2007, but then defeat to Hakuhō on Day 13 meant he was caught by rank–and–filers Kyokutenhō and Tochiōzan, and a final day loss to Baruto meant he finished on 11–4 and missed out on a playoff for the championship. In the next five tournaments he produced five double figure scores, but only just, as they were all 10–5. However, in the May 2013 tournament {{he won his first}} thirteen matches, making a <b>strong</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> a possible start at a run for yokozuna promotion, but he was defeated by Hakuhō on Day 14, and he also lost his final day bout to Kotoshōgiku to finish two wins behind Hakuhō on 13–2. In July 2013 he stopped Hakuhō's streak of 43 consecutive victories by beating him on the 14th day – the third time he has ended a significant winning run of the yokozuna, having also defeated Hakuhō after his 63 wins in a row in November 2010 and 23 in January 2011. After the November 2013 tournament, in which he was runner-up for the fourth time in a row, he was told by the Sumo Association that he would be promoted if he won the championship with at least 13 wins, but he collapsed in the following January basho and won only seven bouts. He pulled out on the final day, missing the first bout of his career. He maintained his ōzeki status with a 9–6 result in March 2014 and was never in danger of demotion again. He finished runner-up in May 2014, January 2015 and May 2015.|$|E
