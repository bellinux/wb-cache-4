5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just had to win. I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, {{in an effort to get}} the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E
25|$|Channing {{continued}} {{her return to}} the stage by teaming up again with playwright John Guare. She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. You do a character but {{how much of it is}} on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> do these people. And flesh them out. I think anything else is not my job.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

And then I also worked with Lupita Nyong'o, who is Kenyan but she did her {{training}} at Yale. So she really shifted her speech so she could do American speech.|$|E
500|$|Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman {{described}} {{the writing process}} as, [...] "When we were writing this album I {{was looking for something}} to beat; I wanted something to beat, but nothing impresses me right now. Nothing sounded really aggressive or heavy enough to inspire me to beat it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> {{had to come up with}} my own shit."

After releasing his version, Jones claimed {{in an interview}} that [...] "Harlem Shake" [...] was a song he originally recorded one year ago for an album by Pauly D, but that they ultimately scrapped it: [...] "When I started to hear the 'Harlem Shake' and heard the beat, I was like damn, I had the record for a year. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> put the record out." ...|$|E
500|$|Nicknamed [...] "The Haze", Adkins {{career began}} in the mid 1950s in an improvised studio in his home near Madison, West Virginia. There he put his vibrant Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis {{influences}} to work by recording scores of songs, beginning with the track [...] "I'm Happy". In a later interview he exclaimed [...] "I couldn't afford no drums <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> stomped my feet." [...] He eventually learned to use percussive instruments to accompany his guitar and vocals, which would become his hallmark sound.|$|E

He later recalled: [...] "My grandfather decided when I was about four [...] I {{was going to be}} a barrister, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> always assumed I was.

500|$|Although vocals {{would usually}} take many {{alternate}} takes to complete, Hoppus completed {{much of the}} vocal track for [...] "Adam's Song" [...] in a single take. [...] "It's in a pretty high register for me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> blasted it out one night after dinner. That's, like, 90 per cent of what's on the final track," [...] he told Kerrang!. The idea to include piano in the track came without much forethought; [...] "We realized, 'Well, this part here could sound rad if we put piano in here.' So we tried it out, and it sounded rad," [...] said Hoppus. The piano was performed by session musician Roger Joseph Manning, Jr., {{best known for his}} work with Beck.|$|E

In a subsequent interview with The Press Democrat, Kahn said of the film: [...] "It was supposed to be this Gone with the Wind. And it was the worst movie.

500|$|Constance {{joined the}} hippie {{movement}} and encouraged her sons {{to get involved}} in the arts. Leto became interested in percussions from the moment he and his brother started playing music together at early age, and his models were artists of many different mediums. [...] "I come from a pretty artistic family," [...] he explained, [...] "There were canvases and paint everywhere, instruments, and all sorts of stuff. It just kind of made sense. I started playing on pots and pans at a very early age, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> kind of flowed into it. It was just a natural progression." [...] He received his first drum kit when he was ten years old and began teaching himself, developing his own style.|$|E
500|$|N.E.R.D {{produced}} a remix featuring Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and Pusha T, which was available as an iTunes and Zune Marketplace bonus track with {{the purchase of}} Seeing Sounds. When asked why the song was remixed, Hugo replied with, [...] "We wanted something with more of a straight-ahead, club-bumping beat, just a different take on it. We like to remix, dismantle, take apart shit {{and put it back}} together. It's just like a Rubik's Cube: When you can't solve it, you just break it and you put it back together."

Although Barea recovered and finished the game, he called the foul [...] "dangerous". Initially Bynum was unapologetic about the incident saying, [...] "We were getting embarrassed. They were breaking us down. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> fouled somebody." [...] He later issued a formal apology to the league and Barea. The NBA suspended Bynum {{for the first five}} games in the next season, but later shortened the suspension to four games due to the lockout-shortened season.|$|E

Due to a strike in Madras, Ilaiyaraaja and Varma completed the background score in Mumbai. The producers suggested Varma to use stock tunes instead for the score. Nagarjuna noticed this {{and asked them to}} provide what Varma asked for, and offered to pay the additional expenses incurred if any. For an action scene, Ilaiyaraaja used moving string music; when Varma asked why, he answered: [...] "They have come here to study and they are fighting. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> felt sad for them".|$|E
