40|$|The {{mechanism}} of breakage of PET (polyethylene terephthalate/cotton <b>staple</b> <b>yarns</b> {{has been investigated}} by study-ing the fibers removed from actual yarn breaks. Techniques have been devised that show the strain history of the PET fibers at a break and live the f: action of broken PET and cotton fibers. It is postulated that yarn breakage takes place in two stages: an initial rupture, followed by breakage of PET fibers spanning the "gap " formed.

This paper studied the UV protection of plain-knitted fabrics made of three types of ring-spun cotton yarns varying in yarn twist level and staple length.

40|$|The {{spinning}} triangle is {{a critical}} area in the spinning process of <b>staple</b> <b>yarns.</b> Its geometry influences the distribution of fiber tension in the spinning triangle and the properties of spun yarns. In earlier theoretical models, the spinning tension of the yarn acting on the convergence point {{is assumed to be}} perpendicular to the nip line of front rollers.

Based on the principle of minimum potential energy, the theoretical model quantitatively describes the fiber tension distribution and its relationships with the spinning parameters, shape of the spinning triangle and the inclination angle of yarn spinning tension. As an application of the proposed method, spinning triangles of a modified ring spinning system were investigated under various spinning parameters. The fiber tension distributions in the spinning triangle both with and without fiber buckling were numerically simulated and the results were compared with those from our earlier model.

50|$|Heat {{setting is}} a term used in the textile {{industry}} to describe a thermal process taking place mostly in either a steam atmosphere or a dry heat environment. The effect of the process gives fibers, yarns or fabric dimensional stability and, very often, other desirable attributes like higher volume, wrinkle resistance or temperature resistance. Very often, heat setting {{is also used to}} improve attributes for subsequent processes. Yarns tend to have increased torquing just after spinning, cabling or twisting. Heat setting can influence or even eliminate this tendency to undesirable torquing. At the winding, twisting, weaving, tufting and knitting processes, an increased tendency to torquing can cause difficulties in processing the yarn. When using heat setting for carpet yarns, desirable results include not only the diminishing of torquing but also the stabilization or fixing of the fiber thread. Both twist stabilization and stabilization of frieze effect are results of the heat setting process. Heat setting benefits <b>staple</b> <b>yarns</b> as well as bulked continuous filament (BCF) yarns. Heat setting often causes synthetic fibers to gain volume as well. This volume growth is commonly described as “bulk development”. All processes using temperature and/or moisture to give textiles one of the above-mentioned attributes are known as heat setting.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} {{the possibility of}} using the close relationship between structure and air permeability of a woven fabric for the detection of the non-uniformity (or defects) {{in the structure of the}} fabric. Air permeability of fabrics is a principal property of the structure of a textile material. A very small change in the structure of the fabric at a given location causes a change in the permeability at that location. First we measure the air permeability at defined locations of the fabric. The method allows us to detect areas with an extreme value of permeability – the locations “suspected ” of extreme unevenness of fabric’s structure. Second, we explore the structure of the fabric in these areas of extreme values of the permeability and attempt to determine the causes of the irregularities in the fabric’s structure. To quantify and describe the degree of these irregularities we applied methods of image analysis and statistical processing on acquired data. For our experiment, woven fabrics in the plain weave made from 100 % <b>staple</b> <b>yarn</b> polyester were used. Results of our research confirm that significantly greater permeability variations occur in the weft direction of the fabric. Subsequent analysis of the structure of the fabric shows the bimodal nature or the data corresponding to the measurement of width of inter-yarn pore in the place of the maximal value of permeability. The observed higher value of permeability can be attributed to the irregularity of warp yarns at a given location of fabric. Initial permeability measurements enabled us to detect locations of its extreme values. Further close examination of these “suspected ” locations of the fabric by a detailed analysis of the structure lead to the determination of the causes of the related irregularities...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic {{membrane}} bioreactors (AnMBRs) physically ensure biomass retention by {{the application}} of a membrane filtration process. With growing application experiences from aerobic membrane bioreactors (MBRs), the combination of membrane and anaerobic processes has received much attention and become more attractive and feasible, due to advantages provided by the combination with regard to developments for energy-efficient wastewater treatment. The major drawbacks of MBR technology are related with membrane costs, especially for the full-scale applications, fouling and low flux. Dynamic membrane (DM) technology may be a promising approach to resolve the drawbacks encountered in MBR processes. One of the most important potential benefits of DMs is that the membrane itself may be no longer necessary, because solids rejection is accomplished by the secondary membrane layer that can be formed and re-formed as a self-forming DM in situ. Different kinds of materials such as mesh, woven or nonwoven fabric instead of microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes can be used as the support layer for creating DM. In this way, the replacement of the membrane by a low cost filter material is possible. By decreasing membrane cost and generating energy, dynamic AnMBRs (AnDMBRs) would be attractive for waste(water) treatment. The main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the applicability of DM technology for the treatment of concentrated wastewaters in AnMBRs. Moreover, this thesis provides additional information and understanding of DM technology, including assessment of DM formation and filtration characteristics under different conditions. Submerged and external membrane module configurations were used in order to determine the effect of the configuration on removal efficiency and DM filterability. Synthetic concentrated wastewater with an average COD concentration of 20 g/L was used as the substrate. Determination of an optimal support material and investigations about its structure were achieved by testing various types of support materials including monofilament, multifilament and <b>staple</b> <b>yarn</b> types. Besides, different operating conditions were tested at low fluxes under mesophilic conditions to determine the optimal operation conditions enabling the optimal removal efficiency and permeate quality. Moreover, cost estimation in terms of support material acquisition was also presented. The results show that support material properties were critical for the formation of an effective dynamic membrane (cake) layer over the filter surface. The critical fluxes obtained with the staple and monofilament filter cloths were higher than those obtained with multifilament material. The results indicate that staple filter cloth was more suitable for depth 8 filtration, whereas mono-monofilament filter was more suitable for surface (cake) filtration. Thus, mono-monofilament filter was considered more appropriate for DM technology. The results presented in this thesis show that the DM filtration concept can turn one of the most important disadvantages of MBRs, membrane fouling, into an advantage. Polypropylene mono-monofilament filter cloth was used to form a dynamic membrane (cake) layer and to provide filtration by this self-forming layer as an alternative to microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes. The AnDMBR achieved over 99 % organic matter removal and particulate matter retention. Moreover, over 60 % soluble COD removal and over 50 % VFA removal were obtained by the DM layer. Considering the results of this research, it was shown that a stable operation with AnDMBRs could be possible for a long period. Sludge retention time (SRT) was found an important factor in AnDMBRs that had a significant effect on soluble microbial products (SMP) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production, protein/carbohydrate ratio, particle size of the sludge, DM layer formation and bulk sludge filterability. Bound EPS is mainly composed of cell surface materials, including proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids and humic acids. EPS keeps the sludge flocs together on the membrane surface by surrounding them. EPS had a significant positive effect on particle flocculation and thus, particle size distribution in the bulk sludge. Prolonged SRT resulted in lower EPS concentrations in the bulk sludge compared to short SRTs. A combination of backwashing and biogas sparging enabled the control of DM layer thickness, which is of great importance to obtain a stable operation and high quality permeate. A combined effect of biomass activity and physical retention capacity through the cake layer might be responsible for the removal of organic matter and retention of particulate matter by the DM layer. Pyrosequencing analyses showed that diversity and richness of the microbial communities including bacteria and archaea in the DM layer were high and microbial population composition in the DM layer was different compared to the bulk sludge in the AnDMBR. Following the DM layer morphological analyses results, the DM layer was formed by both organic and inorganic materials, such as sludge particles, SMP, EPS, Ca, N, P, and Mg precipitates. Moreover, a partial gel layer formation under the cake layer was detected. Accumulation of SMP and bound EPS in the DM layer in high amounts led the formation of a dense cake layer and effective retention. Accumulation of organic matters is also related with operating conditions such as SRT. This research also showed that although slightly better permeate quality in terms of COD concentration was obtained by submerged AnDMBR, high COD removal efficiencies were achieved in both submerged and external AnDMBR configurations. Comparison of the effects of membrane configuration on treatment and filterability performance showed that more time was needed in the external AnDMBR in order to form an effective DM layer enabling a stable removal efficiency and low soluble COD concentration in the permeate. Therefore, submerged AnDMBR configuration appears more suitable when a short start-up period is 9 necessary. Higher methane production rate and methane yield were obtained in the submerged configuration compared to the external configuration reflecting the negative effect of sludge recirculation in the external DM configuration. Conversely, sludge recirculation in the external configuration was more effective in decreasing DM thickness, thus transmembrane pressure, than the bottom biogas sparging in the submerged configuration. Considering the tested different gas sparging velocities (GSVs), over 99 % organic removal was obtained with the external AnDMBR configuration for high strength wastewater treatment irrespective of the GSV, although total filtration resistance increased with decreasing GSV. Total filtration resistance mainly consisted of the resistance by the DM layer that provided effective and stable treatment. Following the organic loading rate study, the AnDMBR achieved high COD removal efficiency at 3. 6 kg COD/m 3. d. In conclusion, following the results obtained in this study, DM technology achieved a stable and high quality permeate. Thus, AnDMBRs can be used as a reliable and satisfactory treatment technology for treatment of high strength wastewaters. Low capital costs of support material and energy generation can make AnDMBRs feasible for those situations in which a high flux is not necessary, such as sludge and slurry treatment or highly concentrated industrial wastewater treatment. However, research on AnDMBRs is still very limited. Longterm applicability and reliability of the DM applications need further research, focusing on cake layer control methods to allow satisfactory DM layer formation as well as on the effect of sludge properties on DM filtration characteristics for large-scale applications.

40|$|Long slender {{structures}} such as textile yarns {{and ocean}} cables show localised buckling behaviour under torsional loading. In a 1 D elastic theory these localised solutions are described by homoclinic orbits in a dynamical system in which arclength along the structure is the independent variable. Upon continued loading after localisation a snap into self-contact and looping may occur. We discuss the intricate bifurcation behaviour that unfolds after the initial jump and also consider the problem of loop pop-out. We also briefly consider {{the mechanics of the}} plied structure that forms and show that the problem is governed by the equations for an elastic rod constrained to lie on a cylinder.

40|$|Development of a Braided Polypropylene Rope Using Polypropylene Tape Yarns is {{a journal}} article. Traditionally, braided ropes are {{manufactured}} using either <b>staple</b> <b>yarns</b> or multifilament yarns. This study therefore sought {{to break this}} traditional paradigm by uniquely and economically manufacturing braided polypropylene ropes using polypropylene tape yarns. A recipe made up of virgin polypropylene granules, calcium carbonate and black masterbatch was used to produce a polypropylene plastic sheet, which was extruded on a Barmag machine. Tape yarns with a width of 22 mm on average were produced. Count, width, thickness, elongation and tensile strength of the tape yarns used to produce the rope were tested. The elongation and tensile strength tests were done on a Micro 500 Testometric strength-testing machine. Test results on the tape yarns revealed that they have properties that fall within the standard range of fibrillated polypropylene tape yarns. Sorptive properties of both the tape yarns used and the braided rope developed revealed {{a slight increase in}} water absorbance to approximately 0. 15 % compared to standard water absorbance of less than 0. 1 %. This increment in water absorbance, however, did not change the floating properties of both the tape yarns and the braided rope as they both remained with their positive buoyancy. Also, no signs of microbial attack were seen on the tape yarns and the braided rope by naked eyes after exposing the samples to water. The resultant braided rope produced was made up of 12 X 4973 denier polypropylene tape yarns with a 9200 -denier polypropylene bailer twine as the core. The count and diameter of the resultant rope were found to be close to those of hazard barrier and hydro-pulling ropes and were also analogous to those of 5 mm cotton braided ropes produced...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} fibre volume {{fraction}} {{on the physical}} and tensile properties of aligned plant fibre composites (PFCs) produced via vacuum infusion has been investigated. There is no clear correlation between fibre volume fraction and porosity. However, low fibre content PFCs are prone to intra-yarn voids, while high fibre content PFCs are prone to inter-yarn voids. This is due to changing resin flow dynamics with increasing fibre content. The tensile behaviour of PFCs with increasing fibre content {{is similar to that}} of conventional fibre reinforced plastics (FRPs). Interestingly, the non-linear stress–strain response of plant fibres has been transferred to the composites. Fibre content and tensile properties are found to be linearly related, as per the rule of mixtures. A void content of up to 4 % is found to have minimal effect on the tensile properties of PFCs. The minimum and critical (vf,crit) fibre volume fractions for aligned flax and jute–polyester composites are found to be substantially higher than conventional aligned FRPs; vf,crit for jute–polyester and carbon–polyester is 8. 1 % and 2. 4 %, respectively. A simple model has also been developed to approximate the theoretical maximum obtainable fibre volume fraction of PFCs reinforced with <b>staple</b> fibre <b>yarns.</b> The absolute theoretical maximum fibre content is found to be 58. 9 %, which agrees with experimental values in literature. A high vf,crit (∼ 10 %) and low vf,max (∼ 45 %) implies that the range of useful fibre volume fractions for PFCs containing <b>staple</b> fibre twisted <b>yarns</b> is only 35 %...|$|R
40|$|<b>Staple</b> fibre <b>yarns</b> vary quite {{markedly}} in {{linear density}} (tex) along their length {{and the degree}} to which twist redistributes from thick to thin places will affect the strength, torque and extension behaviour of the yarn. Theory suggests that twist along worsted yarns should vary as 1 /(tex) 2 if fibres were locked in the structure, whereas themean torque of worsted yarns reported in the literature implies that twist should be proportional to 1 /tex. This article examines twist distribution in ring-spun marl yarns, down to 5 mm resolution, as a function of linear density measured using a high-resolution capacitive sensor. It is found for moderate twist-level worsted yarns that twist is approximately proportional to 1 /(tex) 1. 6. The results and theory provide a guide as to the effect the observed large variations in linear density will have on yarn properties such as tenacity and torque. <br /...|$|R
