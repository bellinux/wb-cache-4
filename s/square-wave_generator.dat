40|$|An {{instrument}} {{was developed to}} measure the concentration of bacterial suspensions by their electrical characteristics. It employed a <b>square-wave</b> signal <b>generator,</b> a tetra-polar electrode probe, and a voltage detector {{in the form of}} an oscilloscope. When electrical measurements were made on washed bacteria obtained from cultures or urine specimens, there was a direct relationship between the concentration of the cells and the electrical characteristics of the system as reflected by voltage changes. As little as 10 (3) organisms per ml could be detected. The resolution between readings taken on samples containing 10 (3) to 10 (9) cells per ml was found to be a function of the input frequency. The maximal resolution between concentration readings was obtained at a input frequency of 10 Hz. Thus, with relatively simple instrumentation, bacterial concentrations could be determined within a few minutes. This technique, therefore, eliminates the more lengthy laboratory procedures as plate counts or the accumulation of measurable metabolic changes (such as the utilization of radioactive or other substrates). This method can efficiently monitor clinical urine specimens when a bacteriuria is suspected...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) are {{multipotent}} nonhematopoietic cells {{with the ability}} to differentiate into various specific cell types, thus holding great promise for regenerative medicine. Early clinical trials have proven that MSC-based therapy is safe, with possible efficacy in various diseased states. Moreover, genetic modification of MSCs to improve their function can be safely achieved using electrogene transfer. We previously achieved transfection efficiencies of up to 32 % with preserved viability in rat MSCs. In this study, we further improved the transfection efficiency and transgene expression in human MSCs (hMSCs), while preserving the cells viability and ability to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes by increasing the plasmid concentration and altering the osmotic pressure of the electrotransfer buffer. Using a <b>square-wave</b> electric pulse <b>generator,</b> we achieved a transfection efficiency of more than 80 %, with around 70 % viability and a detectable transgene expression of up to 30 days. Moreover, we demonstrated that this transfection efficiency can be reproduced reliably on two different sources of hMSCs: the bone marrow and adipose tissue. We also showed that there was no significant donor variability in terms of their transfection efficiency and viability. The cell confluency before electrotransfer had no significant effect on the transfection efficiency and viability. Cryopreservation of transfected cells maintained their transgene expression and viability upon thawing. In summary, we are reporting a robust, safe, and efficient protocol of electrotransfer for hMSCs with several practical suggestions for an optimal use of genetically engineered hMSCs for clinical application...|$|R

An analysis is presented of the flow force acting on a two-way valve using the equilibrium condition of the piston and the equilibrium condition of fluid in the control volume. Three types of flow forces are identified: pressure-difference-induced flow force, viscous-shear-induced flow force, and momentum-induced flow force. Nondimensional analysis shows that among all steady flow force the pressure-difference-induced flow force is largest with viscous-shear-induced flow force the second and momentum-induced flow force the smallest. However, the fluid inertial-induced flow force, which is a momentum-induced flow force, is very important while the pressure transient effect caused by the slight compressibility of the fluid is negligible. A trial test on the steady state flow force shows that the sound-wave phenomenon is strong and additional pressure gradient in the vertical direction needs to be taken into consideration. To enable further experiment 100 -points average and pressure profile factor are introduced. Using a novel <b>square-wave</b> <b>generator</b> it is proved experimentally that the pressure transient effect is true and its magnitude is underestimated by the proposed theory. In addition, geometry characteristic such as leakage, valve length and damping length can change the direction of the pressure transient flow force...|$|E
40|$|The {{low-cost}} low-power complementary {{metal-oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) ultra wideband (UWB) transmitter and receiver front-ends based on impulse technology were developed. The CMOS UWB pulse generator with frequency-band tuning capability was developed, which can generate both impulse and monocycle pulse signals with variable pulse durations. The pulse generator integrates a tuning delay circuit, a <b>square-wave</b> <b>generator,</b> an impulse-forming circuit, and a pulse-shaping circuit in a single chip. When integrated with the binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulator, the transmitter front-end can generate a positive impulse with 0. 8 V, negative impulse with 0. 7 V, {{as well as the}} positive/negative monocycle pulse with 0. 6 ? 0. 8 V, all with tunable pulse durations. The UWB receiver front-end including the template pulse generator, low noise amplifier (LNA), and multiplier was developed. The cascoded common-source inductively degenerated LNA, with extended ultra-wideband ladder matching network, as well as shunt-peaking topology, was selected to form the impulse-type UWB LNA. The structure-optimized and patterned ground shield (PGS) inductors were also studied and used in LNA design to improve the LNA performance. The maximum gain of 12. 4 dB was achieved over the band. For the 3 -dB bandwidth, 2. 6 ? 9. 8 GHz was achieved. The average noise figure of 5. 8 dB was achieved over the entire UWB band of 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz. The UWB multiplier based on the transconductor multiplier structure was investigated, with the shunt-peaking topology applied to achieve the pole-zero cancellation and extend the multiplier bandwidth from 2 GHz to 10 GHz. A low-cost, compact, easy-to-manufacture coplanar UWB antenna was developed that is omni-directional, radiation-efficient and has a stable UWB response. It covers the entire UWB frequency range of 3. 1 ? 10. 6 GHz, with the return loss better than 18 -dB. This novel uniplanar antenna was integrated with the developed CMOS tunable pulse generator to form the UWB transmitter front-end module. This UWB module can transmit the monocycle pulses and the signals having shape similar to the first derivative of the monocycle pulses, all with the tunable pulse durations. The proposed UWB front-ends have the potential application in short-range communication, GPR, and short-range detections...|$|E
