As expected, lidocaine flux in the absence of an enhancer, increased from pH 5 to 9 with a corrresponding increase in the level of the unionized base.

Endothelial cells were more sensitive to surfactant treatment than epithelial cells, and Cremophor EL was more toxic than RH 40 in both cell types. Our results support and complement the previously experimentally described toxic effects of Cremophor EL which {{may be related to}} the clinically recognized side-effects of medicines containing Cremophor EL. <b>Sucrose</b> fatty acid <b>esters</b> are increasingly investigated as novel excipients in pharmaceutical research and some of them are registered in Pharmacopoeias both in the European Union and in the United States. Several studies documented their advantageous properties but few data are available on their toxicity profile, mode of action and efficacy on intestinal epithelial models. Three water soluble <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters,</b> palmitate (P- 1695), myristate (M- 1695), laurate (D- 1216), and two reference absorption enhancers, Tween 80 and Cremophor RH 40 were tested on human Caco- 2 intestinal epithelial cells. <b>Sucrose</b> <b>esters</b> in non-toxic concentrations significantly reduced resistance and impedance of cells, but not reference surfactants. All excipients increased permeability for drugs and fluidized plasma membrane, but did not visibly open tight junctions. Tween 80 but not <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters</b> inhibit P-glycoprotein. Our data indicate that in addition to their dissolution increasing properties <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters</b> can enhance drug permeability through both the transcellular and paracellular routes but this effect is unrelated to P-glycoprotein inhibition. The presented results demonstrate the differences between the cellular actions of various non-ionic surfactant excipients, which can be important for the development of new pharmaceutical formulations and drug delivery systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Due to {{the high}} {{dynamics}} of pharmaceutical products markets, developments of new products using latest innovative technology are becoming a norm of many pharmaceutical companies. Nanoscale materials such as nanoemulsion (NE) offer advantages such as the controllable droplet size, long-term stability, and power solubilization ability. It is beneficial in various delivery systems either for transdermal, ocular, nasal, vaginal, and parenteral drug delivery. The objective {{of the study was}} to prepare avocado oil NE using different surfactants to find the most suitable nanosized droplets, as avocado oil offers a variety of purported nutritional and medicinal benefits. Methods: <b>Sucrose</b> <b>esters,</b> glycerol, and avocado oil with different ratio were used to produce pre-NE by phase inversion technique then pre-NE were self-emulsified with water to produce NE. The influence of the <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters</b> surfactants on the NE formulations were determined using three different types of <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters</b> surfactant (laureate, oleate, and palmitate). Stability study was conducted for NE at different temperatures (4 °C, 25 °C, and 40 °C) for 6 months. Results: The NE contained sucrose laureate produced best nanosized formulations compared to other oleate and palmitate, with optimum droplet size 106 ± 1. 70 nm, size distribution 0. 156 ± 0. 01, and zeta potential - 30. 4 ± 0. 70. The NE formulations were very stable at 4 °C compared to 25 °C and 40 °C while at 25 °C NE showed moderate stability, but it was unstable at 40 °C. Conclusion: Sucrose laureate was able to produce NE with phase inversion and self-emulsification techniques and the ideal storage condition for NE is 4 °C...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{rheological}} {{response of}} air/water interfaces, stabilized by various oligofructose fatty acid esters, to oscillatory dilatational deformations was studied and {{compared to the}} response of interfaces stabilized by <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters.</b> We have followed a traditional approach to surface rheology, where {{the development of the}} modulus as a function of time is studied as well as the frequency dependence of the modulus. We also adopted a different approach where we investigate in detail the amplitude dependence of the modulus. Finally, we studied the temperature dependence. We show that for an accurate characterization of the dilatational rheology of fluid-fluid interfaces with a complex microstructure, a protocol should be used that not only involves variations of surface pressure, frequency, and temperature, but also establishes amplitude dependence. We show that Lissajous plots of surface pressure versus deformation can be useful tools to help interpret surface dilatational behavior in terms of interfacial microstructure. The rheological response of interfaces stabilized by oligofructose esters differed significantly from the response of those stabilized by <b>sucrose</b> <b>esters.</b> <b>Sucrose</b> <b>esters</b> behaved like typical low molecular weight surfactants, and gave interfaces with relatively low moduli, a frequency scaling of the dilatational modulus with an exponent close to 0. 5, and displayed no asymmetries in Lissajous plots. In contrast, the oligofructose esters gave, depending on the fatty acid tail, relatively high moduli, almost independent of frequency. Significant asymmetries were observed in the Lissajous plots, with strain hardening during compression and strain softening during extension. Our results suggest that the unusual rheological properties of interfaces stabilized by oligofructose esters {{may be the result of}} the formation of a two-dimensional soft glass phase by the oligofructose part of the ester...|$|R
