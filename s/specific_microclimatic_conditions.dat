50|$|River {{phenomenon}} describes distinctive, deeply {{incised river}} valleys {{in the landscape}} of Central Europe {{in the sense of}} their biotic, geomorphologic and climatic features. This term is used mainly in the Czech Republic, where it was introduced by several studies in 1960s. Distinctiveness of deep river valleys is based on their sharp contrast to softly undulating landscape, prevailing in middle elevations of Czech. Steep slopes, exposed rocks pronouncing the effect of geological substrate on vegetation, contrast between the sunny and warm southerly oriented slopes and shaded cold northerly oriented slopes, high diversity of various extreme habitats situated next to each other, <b>specific</b> <b>microclimatic</b> <b>conditions</b> causing frequent temperature inversions, the main feature for existence of river phenomenon. The main biotic consequences are: (1) high biodiversity located in deep river valleys, (2) concentration of relict species, resulting from the fact, that deep river valleys served as a refugia for plant and animal species during the era of ice age, (3) function of river valley as a corridor for migration of plants and animals, connecting mountain areas with lowlands, and (4) preservation of the vegetation relatively unaffected by human activities for its inaccessibility.|$|E

40|$|Alvars are {{naturally}} open habitats which {{are found in}} the Great Lakes region in North America and in Scandinavia. The insect fauna of four types of alvars (grassland, grassland savanna, shrubland and pavement) was sampled in the summer of 1996 on Manitoulin Island, Ontario. A total of 9791 specimens from four target insect groups (Coleoptera: Carabidae, Homoptera: Auchenorrhyncha, Hymenoptera: Symphyta and Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea) was identified. Results showed that the grassland savanna and grassland alvars supported the highest number of insect specimens whereas the pavement alvar supported the highest number of species. The origin of the fauna differed between the taxa depending on their closer association with <b>specific</b> <b>microclimatic</b> <b>conditions</b> (Carabidae) or on the presence of host plants (Auchenorrhynca). This first inventory of alvar insects in North America revealed the presence of a high number of species of interest to conservation (rare, disjunct or restricted species) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a research that proposes a thermal comfort index, allowing the verification of the thermal adequacy of outdoor {{spaces in the}} subtropics. The method adopted is experimental inductive, by means of field research {{of a total of}} ninety-eight micro-climatic situations and over two thousand and five hundred applied questionnaires of thermal sensation perception and preference. Deductive method is also applied, by means of regression analysis, considering seventy-two different micro-climatic conditions. The significance of the results is verified by comparison with the ones obtained by simulation of different predictive models and respective indexes, considering the results from twenty-six different micro-climatic conditions gathered in different urban situations from the previous survey. The results from the proposed equation, compared with those from the others predictive models, showed that, for the <b>specific</b> subtropical <b>microclimatic</b> <b>conditions,</b> they present better correlations with the data gathered. Concluding, the methods used provided a simple, easy-to-use and reliable thermal comfort index to assess outdoor thermal comfort in the subtropical climate...|$|R

40|$|The {{ecology of}} {{myxomycetes}} co-existing with the Latridiidae (Coleoptera), bryophytes and ascomycetous, basidiomycetous and anamorphic fungi were studied in Crimea and at different locations {{on the left}} bank of Ukraine. Results from the left bank indicate that the Latridiidae feed on myxomycetes. Colonies {{of the most common}} 13 myxomycete species (which included Stemonitis axifera (Bull.) Macbr., S. fusca Roth, S. splendens Rost., Fuligo septica (L.) Wigg. and Mucilago crustacea Wigg.) were inhabited by 5 species of the Latridiidae. Myxomycete spores were present in guts of 19 of the 25 beetle specimens investigated. Beetles Latridius hirtus, Enicmus rugosus and E fungicola seem to be obligate myxomycete feeders, while Corticarina truncatella was clearly facultative. 13 species of myxomycetes were recorded on 9 species of moss and 3 species of liverwort developing on decaying wood or bark in the Crimean Nature Reserve. Relations between myxomycetes and bryophytes on woody substrata are spatial rather than trophic, and are possibly regulated by <b>specific</b> <b>microclimatic</b> <b>conditions</b> inside bryophyte thallomes. 69 species of myxomycetes were found co-existing with 36 species of ascomycetes, 21 species of basidiomycetes and 9 species of anamorphic fungi in the Crimean Nature Reserve.

40|$|Bees are haplodiploid organisms: haploid males develop from unfertilized eggs, diploid females from fertilized eggs. Under haplodiploidy, {{deleterious}} mutations {{are effectively}} purged by purifying selection on haploid males. Therefore, genetic load and inbreeding depression {{are low in}} bees, which allow them to exist in very small populations, and facilitate the colonization of new areas and habitats by single fertilized females. Exceptions caused by distinct modes of genetic sex-determination are discussed. Owing to the purifying selection and the higher rate of genetic drift in small populations, the genetic variation of bees is only {{one third of the}} variation of diploid insects. As a consequence, bees have less genetic adaptability to environmental change, for which they compensate by exhibiting higher learning ability and greater behavioural plasticity than many other insect taxa. Most bee species need <b>specific</b> <b>microclimatic</b> <b>conditions</b> to perform the proper flight behaviour to provision their nests with larval food. Energy flow and metabolic rates in flight muscles of bees are among the highest ever measured in animal tissue. The temperature dependence of the enzymes which drive the flight muscle metabolism is therefore of critical importance for the functioning of the system. Mutations which change the thermal tolerance range of one of those enzymes might lead to changing habitat requirements, and parapatric or allochronous population divergence. The fact that bees choose their nesting site very carefully already hints at the critical role, temperature and humidity ranges play for bee development. Experiments show a remarkable dependence of learning ability and behaviour on developmental temperatures. Evolutionary and ecological aspects of social behaviour, social and cleptoparasitism, and flower choice in bees are discussed. Possible paths of population divergence and speciation are pointed out. The reproduction rate of bees is closer to the rates of primates than to that of other insects. Compared to other insects, bees evolve only slowly...|$|E
40|$|The {{largest and}} the most {{coherent}} complexes of natural spruce stands in Croatia are currently distributed in the altimontane and subalpine vegetation belt of Velebit over an area of 3165 ha and altitudes ranging from 1100 to almost 1600 m. Past phytocoenological research into spruce forests in northern Velebit distinguishes three different associations: frost valleys of Štirovača and Apatišanska Duliba support the altimontane spruce forest with bastard agrimony (Aremonio-Piceetum Horvat 1938), shallower sink holes and slopes descending from the surrounding tops contain the altimontane-subalpine spruce forest with Laserpitium krapfii (Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum Vukelić et al. 2010), while rocky tops, hips, karrens and ridges feature the subalpine spruce forest with small-reed (Calamagrostio variae-Piceetum Bertović 1975). These associations are distributed as azonal, microclimatically and edaphically conditioned associations, of which spruce forest with bastard agrimony occurs in the belt of Dinaric beech-fir forest (Omphalodo-Fagetum) while the two others grow in a higher belt of subalpine beech forest with buttercup (Ranunculo platanifoliae-Fagetum). Their mutual differences result from ecological factors which are decisive for their occurrence and distribution. Of these, the edaphic relationships which we explored in this work draw particular interest. Composite samples {{were taken from the}} top layer up to 5 cm deep (13 composite samples composed of 9 individual samples each), pedological profiles were opened (11 profiles), and soil samples were taken by pedogenetic horizons within pedological research in three spruce communities: altimontane spruce forest with bastard agrimony (Aremonio-Piceetum), altimontane-subalpine spruce forest with Laserpitium krapfii (Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum), and subalpine spruce forest with small-reed (Calamagrostio-Piceetum) in the area of northern Velebit and Štirovača. Composite samples, taken from the top soil layer up to 5 cm deep, consisted of 9 samples, each taken at a distance of 1 m in a cross pattern. Soil samples were analyzed by means of the following laboratory methods: determination of pH values (HRN ISO 10390 : 2005), determination of CaCO 3 content (HRN ISO 10693 : 2004), determination of organic and total carbon and nitrogen with dry combustion (HRN ISO 10694 : 2004, HRN ISO 13878 : 2004), determination of concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd (HRN ISO 11466 : 2004), and determination of the granulometric soil composition (HRN ISO 11277 : 2004). Descriptive statistics were made for all the samples by the investigated phytocoenosis. Variance analysis was used to test the differences between the composite soil samples for the layer of up to 5 cm in depth. Statistica 7. 0 software was used for this purpose. The analyses of composite soil samples taken from a depth of 5 cm in three different spruce communities (Aremonio-Piceetum, Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum and Calamagrostio-Piceetum) showed than the lowest pH value was recorded in the community Aremonio-Piceetum, followed by the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, while the highest value was recorded in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum. The average pH (H 2 O) value in the community Aremonio-Piceetum reaches 4. 35, in Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum it is 5. 56 and in Calamagrostio-Piceetum it is 5. 23. In terms of pH values for soil depths of up to 5 cm, the communities Aremonio-Piceetum and Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum (pH H 2 O, p= 0. 01447; pH CaCl 2, p= 0. 01668) show a statistically significant difference. In all the communities the surface soil layer is richly humous and well supplied with nitrogen. It is the richest in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, where the average value of C org amounts to 131. 6 g kg– 1 and N tot. to 9. 3 g kg– 1 (Table 3). The C : N ratio in all the three communities is favourable and ranges between 11 and 15. The average depth of the humus-accumulative horizon amounting to 6. 5 cm is the lowest in the community Aremonio-Piceetum. It is higher in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum where it reaches 7. 5 cm and the highest in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, where it is 21 cm. The content of pH values, C org., N tot. in the hummus-accumulative horizon shows similar values and an identical trend to composite soil samples at a depth of up to 5 cm. In terms of the argyle-accumulative and cambic horizon, the lowest pH value is observed in the community Aremonio-Piceetum, where the average pH (H 2 O) value is 5. 30. In the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum, the average pH (H 2 O) value is 6. 92. The highest pH value is observed in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, where the average pH (H 2 O) value reaches 7. 21, but it is only one profile opened in the shallow and distinctly skeletal calcocambisol. All the soils have a texture ranging from silty to clayey loam. Soil reaction was the only parameter to show statistically significant differences for the top soil layer. These differences relate to the communities Aremonio-Piceetum and Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum. The lowest pH value in the community Aremonio-Piceetum is conditioned by acid parent material, flat relief which additionally favours the podzolization process in the perhumid climate, while <b>specific</b> <b>microclimatic</b> <b>conditions,</b> frost sites and high air humidity cause more intensive accumulations of raw humus. In relation to the pH reaction, the lowest acidity is displayed by the association Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum, as confirmed by phytocoenological research (Vukelić et al. 2010), according to which this community, compared to others, has the biggest number of species of the order Fagetalia. These species are dominant in adjacent, mainly neutrophilic beech and beech-fir forests. All the three studied communities, Aremonio-Piceetum, Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum and CalamagrostioPiceetum, manifested high Pb contamination in the surface soil layer of up 5 cm. The average Pb content (median) in the community Aremonio-Piceetum amounts to 54. 5 mg kg– 1, in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum to 65. 0 mg kg– 1, and in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum to 54. 7 mg kg– 1. The top soil layer of 5 cm in the communities Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum and Calamagrostio-Piceetum also manifested high Zn and Cd contamination. The average content (median) in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum for Zn is 101. 0 mg kg– 1 and for Cd it is 1. 0 mg kg– 1, whereas in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum it is 75. 0 mg kg– 1 for Zn and 1. 9 mg kg– 1 for Cd...|$|E

Air temperature, relative air humidity and the rectal temperature of calves (n= 324) were measured in the hutches and pens during three consecutive years. The hypothesis that the climatic conditions of different housing system designs used in calf rearing affect the thermal comfort of calves was confirmed, as the design of the individual housing systems affected <b>microclimatic</b> <b>conditions</b> and subsequently the rectal temperature of the housed calves as well. Statistically significant differences (P P < 0. 05) lower air temperature and significantly higher level of both relative air humidity and calf rectal temperature. These significantly higher rectal temperatures in both summer and in transitional periods (from March to June and from September to December) can be explained by <b>microclimatic</b> <b>conditions</b> and specifically by the combination of air temperature and the highest relative humidity that caused less comfortable <b>microclimatic</b> <b>conditions</b> for calves.

ECB larval survival and egg mortality factors but not egg hatch {{were affected by}} the irrigation treatments. Predation and dislodgement {{were the most important}} egg mortality factors. Desiccation increased on non-irrigated, reproductive stage plants. Irrigation had little effect on the distribution of larvae on the plants. Larval survival was 7. 5 % on whorl stage plants in the non-irrigated location in 1990 and 13. 1 % on reproductive stage plants in the limited irrigation location in 1991. Larval survival declined in other year and irrigation treatment combinations to a range of 0 % to 4 % on whorl stage plants and 0 % to 3. 3 % on reproductive stage plants. Field <b>microclimatic</b> <b>conditions</b> were hotter and dryer in non-irrigated plots, particularly on reproductive stage plants. The environmental conditions were summarized with two to five principal components. Through logistic regression analysis, the observed ECB larval survival was explained with two to three of the principal components. <b>Microclimatic</b> <b>conditions</b> were similar between field observations, data from a local and the average of four distant automated weather stations. A model based on the response of plant leaves to <b>microclimatic</b> <b>conditions,</b> when modified, gave leaf surface temperature predictions from automated weather station data that were similar to field temperatures. The principal components of the predicted environmental conditions were similar to those derived from the field conditions. Logistic regression analysis indicated that ECB larval survival was related to the same principal components predicted from the automated weather stations as those derived from environmental conditions observed in the field. These results indicate that neonate ECB larval survival was related to <b>microclimatic</b> <b>conditions</b> that were either observed in the field or predicted from distant automated weather stations. ...|$|R
