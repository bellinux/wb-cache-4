500|$|Haynes {{ordered a}} one-horsepower marine upright, two-cycle engine from Sintz Gas Engine Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan for $225. Although {{the engine was}} {{intended}} for use on a small boat, Haynes believed it could be adapted for his purposes. The [...] engine arrived {{in the fall of}} 1893. Haynes soon had the device attached to a carriage he built in his kitchen. He found when he started the engine that its vibrations were too severe for the harness it was in, and before he could <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> it had done considerable damage to the carriage and the floor of his kitchen, and filled the room with smoke.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{engine is}} overheating! [...] Please <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and consult the owner's manual!" ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the train}} brakes are applied during normal operations, the engine {{operator}} makes a [...] "service application" [...] or a [...] "service rate reduction‚Äù, {{which means that}} the train line pressure reduces at a controlled rate. It takes several seconds for the train line pressure to reduce and consequently takes several seconds for the brakes to apply throughout the train. In the event the train needs to make an emergency <b>stop,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> operator can make an [...] "emergency application," [...] which immediately and rapidly vents all of the train line pressure to atmosphere, resulting in a rapid application of the train's brakes. An emergency application also results when the train line comes apart or otherwise fails, as all air will also be immediately vented to atmosphere.|$|E
60|$|This was frightful! I seized <b>the</b> bell-ropes and <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
25|$|If {{the turn}} is in {{response}} to a man overboard, <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> when <b>the</b> {{target point}} is 15 degrees off the bow. Ease the rudder and back <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> as required.|$|R
2500|$|The two {{different}} wings {{known to have}} been fitted to the Parasol both had constant chord and very square tips. [...] They were of fabric covered wood construction. [...] The quite slender fuselage was a mixture of steel tubes and spruce, square sided aft of the cockpits and rounded forwards. [...] The supercharged 226hp (167kW) Armstrong Siddeley Lynx radial engine was smoothly cowled but with its cylinder heads exposed. [...] The observer sat in the front cockpit, allowing him direct access to the dynamometer. [...] This had a control wheel and dial for the force readings, plus a lever with which he could free, read or lock the instrument. [...] The pilot's cockpit, behind and with a view unobstructed by the wing had two unusual controls associated with the measurements. [...] He could engage a pair of dynamometer cams which limited its movement and that of the wings to the 6mm necessary for a force measurement in case of a dynamometer failure. [...] He also controlled an hydraulic brake which was used to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> during measurements and avoid prop wash interference. [...] After a period of gliding flight, the engine could be restarted with a gas starter.|$|E
60|$|He {{sprang to}} the front of the biplane to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> but ere he could do so one of the horses broke away and galloped madly away in the {{direction}} of the woods. Then another followed.|$|E
60|$|It was {{becoming}} more and more difficult to maintain our little vessel in a horizontal position. Lower and lower sagged the bow until it became necessary to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to prevent our flight terminating in a swift dive to the ground.|$|E
60|$|He {{pushed back}} the {{throttle}} on his steering-wheel and <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> Then {{he turned toward}} her.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the right}} way," [...] said Mr. Britling. [...] "Care--oh damn! I've <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> again. Ugh!--ah!--so!--Care, I was saying--and calm." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{listened and}} heard the men and Baxter {{walk away from the}} hatchway. Then all became quiet, for Tom had <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
60|$|All of the Rover boys {{realized}} their extreme peril, yet for {{the moment}} they were powerless {{to do anything to}} help themselves. Dick put out his hand to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> of the biplane, then concluded that it might be more advantageous to keep the propellers moving.|$|E
60|$|Tom Myers and {{his brother}} George had already started for the pilot-house, when Rectus shouted to them that he'd run down to the {{engineer}} {{and tell him to}} <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> So they stopped, and Rectus was just going below when Scott called to him to hold up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poole can be glad {{he was not}} drowned," [...] {{said the}} doctor. [...] "It was {{nice of you to}} <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> of his boat. But after this I want all of you to be more careful. I do not want to lose any of my boys!" [...] And the look he gave them went to the heart of every lad present.|$|E
5000|$|Idle-cutoff position, {{where all}} fuel flow is cutoff to the metered {{side of the}} fuel chamber, thereby closing <b>the</b> servo valve, <b>stopping</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
50|$|In large ships, an {{emergency}} <b>stop</b> button pulls <b>the</b> countershaft for the fuel pumps to <b>the</b> <b>stop</b> position, {{cutting off the}} fuel supply and <b>stopping</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b> With a controllable-pitch propeller, <b>the</b> <b>stop</b> button may declutch <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> from <b>the</b> propeller.|$|R
50|$|Stop-Start {{technology}} was fitted to a Bentley {{for the first}} time in 2016 on the Bentayga model. Bentley's system <b>stops</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> when <b>the</b> car is <b>stopped</b> or moving slowly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I, {{but it is}} so easy to see! It is {{the dream}} of Maxendorf's life to bring England to the verge of a {{revolution}} by paralysing her industries. Better for him, that, than any violent scheme of conquest. If he can <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> that drives the wheels of the country, they can come over in tourist steamers and tell us how to govern it better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{was a tall}} girl, {{slim and}} slender, you know the kind, with black hair, remarkably long hanging, down loose behind her, as she stood there no more afraid than nothing, her arms spread out to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> She was wearing a slimpsy sort of garment wrapped around her that wasn't cloth but ocelot skins, soft and dappled, and silky. It was all she had on--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "we can't go back, {{whether we}} want to or not. It's much worse behind there {{than it is in}} front. There's only one chance. Go for it {{straight}} ahead in your first speed. It may not <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> In any case, it will be worse presently. There's no use funking it. If the worst happens, we can sit in the car. The water won't be above our heads and there are some boats about. Blow your horn well first, in case there's any one within hearing, and then go for it." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{the clutch}} pedal is fully depressed, the clutch is fully disengaged, and no torque is {{transferred}} from <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to <b>the</b> transmission (and by extension to the drive wheels). In this uncoupled state {{it is possible to}} select gears or to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> car without <b>stopping</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Veliger's {{a lively}} tar, the liveliest afloat,A {{whirling}} wheel {{on either side}} propels his little boat;But when the danger signal warns his bustling submarine,He <b>stops</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> shuts <b>the</b> port, and drops below unseen.|$|R
50|$|On February 14, 2012, the Chetzemoka's {{smoke stack}} overheated. The vessel {{was not at}} risk of fire. The {{overheating}} was caused by starting and <b>stopping</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> too soon, because the Point Defiance-Tahleqhah route is very short.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} the canoes were drawing level {{with them as}} they approached the islet. He could see the wet paddles glinting, and the naked bodies swing, while presently Jefferson, who made Bill a little sign to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> stood up on the deck. The case of giant-powder lay open at his feet, and Bill laid a glowing iron on the cylinder covering. The men in the canoes ceased paddling, and while the craft slid slowly nearer each other there was {{for a moment or two}} an impressive silence, through which Austin fancied he could hear a faint rhythmic throbbing. Then Jefferson, who cut one of the rolls of giant-powder through, flung up his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that steamer, {{which was}} called the Duke of Dorchester, and which was a vessel of not more than a {{thousand}} tons, wasn't much of a sailer, or perhaps they was saving coal, I don't know which, and, not knowing how much coal ought to be used, I kept my mouth shut on that point; but I had the log thrown a good deal, and I found that we never quite came up to ten knots an hour, and when we took an observation at noon the next day, we saw that we hadn't quite done the hundred miles; but a little before one o'clock we did it, and then I ordered the captain to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and lay to.|$|E
60|$|The {{hatch to}} the engine room was battened down, access being gained through a narrow passage from the cabin. The heat and gas fumes were stifling. Grief took one hasty, {{comprehensive}} examination of the engine and the fittings of the tiny room, then blew out the oil-lamp. After that he worked in darkness, save for the glow from endless cigars which {{he went into the}} cabin to light. Even-tempered as he was, he soon began to give evidences of the strain of being pent in with a mechanical monster that toiled, and sobbed, and slubbered in the shouting dark. Naked to the waist, covered with grease and oil, bruised and skinned from being knocked about by the plunging, jumping vessel, his head swimming from the mixture of gas and air he was compelled to breathe, he laboured on hour after hour, in turns petting, blessing, nursing, and cursing the engine and all its parts. The ignition began to go bad. The feed grew worse. And worst of all, the cylinders began to heat. In a consultation held in the cabin the half-caste engineer begged and pleaded to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> for half an hour in order to cool it and to attend to the water circulation. Captain Warfield was against any stopping. The half-caste swore that the engine would ruin itself and stop anyway and for good. Grief, with glaring eyes, greasy and battered, yelled and cursed them both down and issued commands. Mulhall, the supercargo, and Hermann were set to work in the cabin at double-straining and triple-straining the gasoline. A hole was chopped through the engine room floor, and a Kanaka heaved bilge-water over the cylinders, while Grief continued to souse running parts in oil.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take care of yourself, Tom," [...] called Dick, who had now <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> And {{then he and}} Sam {{watched their}} brother and the farmer as they went riding away at top speed after the runaway steeds.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> {{beamed at}} him--there in the dust, on the quiet hilltop. He said as apologetically {{as though he}} had been at fault, [...] "Distributor got dry. Might give it a little oil about once in six months." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{piece of}} main bearing and its fixing bolt {{were the first}} items found in the debris trail towards the derailed train at 453m back from where <b>the</b> train <b>stopped.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> block was 205m back from <b>the</b> <b>stopped</b> train. <b>The</b> track was damaged over a {{distance}} of 330m.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This {{morning was}} a {{beautiful}} calm. We reached the buoys at about 4.30 and commenced picking up at 6.30. Shortly a new cause of anxiety arose. Kinks came up in great quantities, about thirty in the hour. To have a true conception of a kink, you must see one: [...] it is a loop drawn tight, all the wires get twisted and the gutta- percha inside pushed out. These much diminish {{the value of the}} cable, as they must all be cut out, the gutta-percha made good, and the cable spliced. They arise from the cable having been badly laid down so that it forms folds and tails {{at the bottom of the}} sea. These kinks have another disadvantage: they weaken the cable very much. - At about six o'clock [P.M.] we had some twelve miles lifted, when I went to the bows; the kinks were exceedingly tight and were giving way in a most alarming manner. I got a cage rigged up to prevent the end (if it broke) from hurting anyone, and sat down on the bowsprit, thinking I should describe kinks to Annie:- suddenly I saw a great many coils and kinks altogether at the surface. I jumped to the gutta-percha pipe, by blowing through which the signal is given to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> I blow, but the engine does not stop; again - no answer: the coils and kinks jam in the bows and I rush aft shouting stop. Too late: the cable had parted and must lie in peace at the bottom. Someone had pulled the gutta-percha tube across a bare part of the steam pipe and melted it. It had been used hundreds of times in the last few days and gave no symptoms of failing. I believe the cable must have gone at any rate; however, since it went in my watch and since I might have secured the tubing more strongly, I feel rather sad. [...] .|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} form of gab {{valve gear}} or 'gab clutch' {{was a simple}} notch in the valve rod, where it hooked over the valve spindle. A hand lever allowed this notch to be lifted, thus disengaging the valve drive and promptly <b>stopping</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{method of}} {{reversing}} {{the car was}} offered on later models via a reversible Dynastart unit. The Dynastart unit, which doubled as both starter motor and dynamo on these models incorporated a built-in reversing solenoid switch.
