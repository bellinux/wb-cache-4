Additionally, a square tower was also built on top in lieu of the original cupola which included a <b>school</b> <b>bell.</b> From its construction until 1987, Waller Hall was used as an academic hall and hosted classes along with housing the school's chapel and as offices for the faculty.|$|E

They stopped to pay their respects at the Boer War Memorial where the Allora Mayor, Cr T Muir, made a speech. The memorial had been unveiled in 1904 by Colonel (later Sir) Harry Chauvel, honouring the four local men who died, and 35 others who served in the southern African conflict.

500|$|Not all {{the land}} {{that made up the}} site of Fort Stanton was {{converted}} to public park land. In 1920, local African-American Catholics constructed Our Lady of Perpetual Help church on land formerly owned by Dr. J.C. Norwood, a local physician. After the remaining grounds of the fort were purchased in 1925, nearby residents reportedly [...] "walked family cows to Fort Stanton Park to graze before the <b>school</b> <b>bell</b> rang." [...] Today, the church still stands adjacent to the grounds of the park. The Washington D.C. Department of Parks and National Park Service jointly manage the 67 acres of park land that stand {{on the site of the}} fort today. D.C. authorities manage approximately 11 acres that contain a recreation center and ball fields, while the National Park Service manages the remaining acreage, which is mostly wooded and contains the remains of forts Stanton and Ricketts. The area also is site to the Anacostia Museum, a Smithsonian Institution facility devoted to the history of African-Americans.|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Countdown to Extinction {{was written in}} two {{different}} sessions. The first session was done following the conclusion of Clash of the Titans tour, while the second session took place after a one-month break, {{in the fall of}} 1991. The album was recorded {{in the first half of}} 1992, when the Rodney King Riots took place. These events negatively affected the recording process, as the band was forced to leave the studio every night at six o'clock because of the enacted curfew. Dave Mustaine shared his experience: [...] "There’s nothing worse than getting a creative moment and you have to leave. It was like a <b>school</b> <b>bell</b> ringing." [...] The record was produced by Mustaine and Max Norman at The Enterprise in Burbank, California, while the mixing was handed by Norman with the help of Fred Kelly. Referring to the recording process, Mustaine said that Countdown to Extinction [...] "was one of those records where everything was firing on all 12 cylinders and you just know it". He also said that it didn't take the band a long time to record the album because [...] "records were a lot easier to make back then because the pressure wasn't quite as hard".|$|E

2500|$|The {{two major}} {{defining}} characteristics of English handbells are their clappers {{and ability to}} produce overtones. The clapper on an English handbell is on a hinge and moves {{back and forth in}} a single direction, unlike a <b>school</b> <b>bell</b> in which the clapper swings freely in any direction. It also has a spring that holds the clapper away from the casting after the strike to allow the bell to ring freely. [...] Furthermore, the shaft of the clapper is rigid, such that the bell may be held with its mouth facing upward. The overtones on an English handbell are a 12th (an octave and a perfect fifth) above the fundamental, while Dutch handbells – such as Petit & Fritsen – focus on the overtone a minor 10th (an octave and a minor third) or a major 10th (an octave and a major third) above the fundamental.|$|E
2500|$|... "Edmund Rice College <b>school</b> <b>bell</b> rang for {{the first}} time in 1963 to the sounds of a {{construction}} site. Hammers punctuated English lessons and Maths was conducted as the building multiplies in size around the 115 founding students. It was a rugged start to Rotorua's first Catholic boys' college. The boys were pioneers. The facilities in the early days were very basic. The ovals were just farm fields, the buildings were not complete. Nonetheless, in its opening year the school field sports teams, sent a contingent to Tauranga to meet the Queen and staged a musical. Parents took time off to develop the playing fields and roads. The opening year, 1963, was 201 years after the birth of the school's namesake and founder of the Christian Brothers, Blessed Edmund Ignatius Rice. Edmund Rice College was fully staffed by Christian Brothers when it opened but gradually lay teachers were employed as fewer Brothers became available. The college became a State-integrated school in 1983, as a Form 3-7 Secondary College with an attached intermediate School." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a young child, Bell, {{like his}} brothers, {{received}} his early schooling at {{home from his}} father. At an early age, he was enrolled at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left {{at the age of}} 15, having completed only the first four forms. His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades. His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his demanding father. Upon leaving <b>school,</b> <b>Bell</b> travelled to London to live with his grandfather, Alexander Bell. During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study. The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself. At the age of 16, Bell secured a position as a [...] "pupil-teacher" [...] of elocution and music, in Weston House Academy at Elgin, Moray, Scotland. Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board and £10 per session. The following year, he attended the University of Edinburgh; joining his older brother Melville who had enrolled there the previous year. In 1868, not long before he departed for Canada with his family, Bell completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to University College London.|$|E
