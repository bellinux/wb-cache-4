50|$|Sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua) and {{red maple}} {{are the most}} {{abundant}} trees in the hardwood swamp forests. American holly (Ilex opaca), a broadleaf evergreen tree, is common.

50|$|Nyssa ogeche, {{commonly}} referred to as Ogeechee tupelo, white tupelo, river lime, ogeechee lime tree, <b>sour</b> <b>gum</b> or wild lime is a deciduous tree. Growing to 15 m, it is in flower from March to May, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The flowers are pollinated by bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.|$|E
50|$|Swamp forests {{dominated}} by Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) occur along the waterways {{of the pine}} barrens. The white cedars often grow from pools of standing water and, {{in contrast to the}} surrounding pine forests, considerably darken the understory. Amid the white cedars are red maple (Acer rubrum), <b>sour</b> <b>gum</b> (Nyssa sylvatica), pitch pine, and sweet bay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana). In openings and edges grow highbush blueberry, dangleberry, swamp azalea (Rhododendron viscosum), fetterbush (Eubotrys racemosa), and leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata). Sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), inkberry (Ilex glabra), and winterberry (Ilex verticillata) are also present.|$|E

40|$|Flow of {{sour cherry}} (Prunus cerasus L. cv. Montmorency) gum {{solutions}} {{through a glass}} capillary was Newtonian for pressure gradients from 0 to 1. 8 megapascals per meter, and hydraulic conductance was inversely proportional to solution viscosity in this range. However, flow became plastic at pressure gradients above 1. 8 megapascals per meter, resulting in a decrease in solution viscosity. The magnitude of this effect diminished as gum concentration increased. Flow of water, a solution of the component sugar monomers of <b>sour</b> cherry <b>gum,</b> and sucrose solutions remained Newtonian over the entire pressure gradient range examined (0 - 4 megapascals per meter). Plastic flow of gum solutions in the vessels of intact sour cherry shoots is possible under pressure gradients induced by transpiration when high resistance to flow occurs over short distances...|$|R
5000|$|Spermicides {{have been}} around for a long time. Ancient Egyptians used to use them to {{regulate}} family size and pregnancy. Spermicide remedies included ingredients like acacia <b>gum,</b> <b>sour</b> milk, crocodile dung and natron minerals were mixed with plant ﬁbers and honey and formed into a pessary. [...] Modern researchers A. Pakrashi et al. have found acacia to be spermicidal. Ttriterpene saponins from Acacia auriculiformis were found to have sperm immobilizing effect in vitro. This acacia derivative successfully prevented sperm entry into the cervical mucus, disrupted spermatozoa plasma membrane and disintegrated the acrosomal cap. Today it is understood that the more acidic the vagina is, sperm death is increased due to a hostile environment.|$|R

50|$|Cattus Island Park also {{contains}} freshwater wetlands. These wetlands {{are dominated by}} hardwood trees such as Red Maple or Swamp Maple, <b>Sour</b> <b>Gum</b> or Tupelo and {{a wide variety of}} others. There are a few small stands of living Atlantic White Cedar located in some of the wetland areas. However, in this area, large stands of dead Atlantic white cedar also exist. They have been standing dead since the 1930s. Prior to the 1930s, {{the northern part of the}} Barnegat Bay, where Cattus Island is located, was mainly fresh water. After the Point Pleasant Canal was constructed and the Manasquan inlet improved, saltwater from the ocean infiltrated into the Northern portion of the bay. As a result, the Atlantic white cedar, which is an obligate freshwater species, was killed.|$|E

Felled in April 2015 out of safety concerns, the tree was a Nyssa sylvatica, also known as a black tupelo, tupelo, black gum, <b>sour</b> <b>gum</b> or pepperidge tree. A cross section of its trunk is preserved in a gazebo in Lincoln Park. Apparently in connection with the controversy surrounding the removal of [...] "Old Peppy," [...] a copper commemorative plaque was stolen from Lincoln Park. The plaque had been mounted by the Cranford Historical Society on a rock near the tree, and was originally placed in 1964. Since the removal of the tree on April 21, 2015, the plaque was all that remained to remind Cranford of the tree's history.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: High {{population}} densities ofwhite-tailed deer (Odocoeleus virginianus) in Pennsylvania's forested regions alter vegetation {{composition and}} regeneration by browsing young seedlings, woody shrubs and herbaceous plants. This research examined the affects of deer browse on the woody plant species of Warwick County Park's interior forest habitat by statistically testing the preference of deer to consume certain species. Six plots were randomly {{located within the}} interior forest habitat. An initial browse survey was conducted within the center four by four meters of each plot. All available and browsed stems by species were counted. A chi-squared analysis perfonned on the observed number of stems browsed {{as compared to the}} expected number of stems browsed by species showed that certain species were consumed in greater proportion to their availability than others. Species that were consumed less than expected included multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora), American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and maple leaf viburnum (Viburnum acerfolium). Species that were consumed more than expected included chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), red maple (Acer rubrum), and <b>sour</b> <b>gum</b> (Nyssa sylvatica). These results indicate that the pattern of woody species consumption by deer is not a random process and deer are browsing selectively. This preference towards specific species could cause a long-tenn change in the composition of the forest canopy tree species and a decrease in the biodiversity of the park. INTRODUCflON vegetation, deer browse, is measured by countin...|$|E
