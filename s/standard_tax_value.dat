It is a common practice to declare the <b>tax</b> <b>value</b> as a transaction price, when a transaction with a real estate is done. This leads to a number of risks to buyers and sellers, low revenues for municipalities, notaries and register offices, as well as to distortion of statistics of real estate prices and their growth. Some possibilities for updating <b>tax</b> <b>values</b> are analysed, which will increase the transparency of real estate markets in the country and the confidence of investors — local and foreign. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>standard</b> <b>tax</b> {{competition}} literature {{predicts a}} {{race to the bottom}} in capital tax rates as capital mobility increases. Recently, the very different modeling framework of the new economic geography literature has produced the contrasting result that economic integration leads to agglomeration rents to capital which can be taxed away, in turn leading to higher corporate taxation. This paper incorporates increasing returns directly into the <b>standard</b> <b>tax</b> competition modeling framework to identify the origin of this disparity of results. The model illustrates that increasing returns reduce traditional tax competition pressures as capital mobility increases, and that changes in preferences for the public good, combined with increasing cross-border ownership of capital, and thus taxexporting incentives, are the main factors driving tax rates higher. Tax exporting has not previously been linked endogenously to capital mobility in <b>standard</b> <b>tax</b> competition models or new economic geography models.

40|$|The "race to the bottom" {{result of}} the <b>standard</b> <b>tax</b> {{competition}} literature implies that capital taxes are competed downward as capital becomes more mobile. The new economic geography literature, in contrast, finds that increasing capital mobility {{can be associated with}} a rise in capital tax rates, or a "race to the top. " This paper derives the race to the top result from within the <b>standard</b> <b>tax</b> competition modeling framework augmented with agglomeration forces. When agglomeration forces are sufficiently strong, tax competition pressures are mitigated and capital taxes are instead driven by tax exporting incentives.

The demand for waterfront property in eastern North Carolina as a site for second homes for the relatively wealthy has resulted in a tremendous disparity of prices in such locales.
