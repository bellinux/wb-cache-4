40|$|Splined Mandrel Flow Forming (SMFF) is an {{effective}} method for fabricating a variety of internally-ribbed cylindrical parts. The process is, however, prone to premature failure of the splined mandrels and this {{is thought to be}} related to the magnitude of the forming forces exerted by the <b>forming</b> <b>rollers</b> on the mandrel splines. In this thesis an experimentation-based approach is used to investigate the effects of critical process parameters; namely, Inter-roller offset of the X 1 -X 2 <b>forming</b> <b>rollers,</b> Oa, roller inclination angle, roller nose radius, r 0, <b>forming</b> <b>roller</b> feed rate and mandrel rotational speed, on forming forces exerted on an AISI 1020 steel work piece as it is flow formed over a splined mandrel. The combined effect of these parameters on the maximum forming forces, Fmax, the roller forceoscillation amplitude, ΔF, and the roller/ work piece contact area are examined for an X 1 <b>forming</b> <b>roller</b> during the third pass for SMFF tests performed under various process conditions...|$|R
50|$|A simple {{indication}} {{of the quality of}} a printing press is the number of distribution and <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b> The greater the number of distribution rollers, the more accurate the control of ink uniformity. It is difficult to ink large solid areas on a plate with only one ink <b>form</b> <b>roller.</b> With three (generally the maximum), it is relatively easy to maintain consistent ink coverage of almost any image area on the plate. Business forms presses, which print very little coverage, usually only have one or two ink <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b> Because of this, they cannot print large solid or screen images. Smaller, less sophisticated presses also have the same problem, however, many of the newer presses today are being equipped with larger, better inking systems to meet the growing print demands of the consumer.|$|R

These systems are known as [...] "indirect" [...] since the water travels to the offset plate passing through the inking system and not directly to the offset plate as direct systems do. Some indirect systems will have the ability to feed the water into the inking system {{as well as to the}} offset plate. A fine emulsion of ink and water is then developed on the ink <b>form</b> <b>roller.</b> This is one reason printers need to know about [...] "water pickup" [...] or what percentage of water can be taken up by the ink. These systems are also known as [...] "integrated" [...] dampening systems as they are integrated into the inking system. One of the benefits of these systems, is that they do not use covers thus they react more quickly when dampening changes are made. One generally finds this type of dampening systems on newer and faster press equipment today.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to prove Mishchenko's conjecture. For this purpose, {{we have used a}} {{structure}} called a complex of Lie algebroids. This structure commences by xing a smooth triangulation of the base of a transitive Lie algebroid by a simplicial complex and taking the restriction of the Lie algebroid to all simplices of the triangulation. Since the Lie algebroid is transitive, the restriction of the Lie algebroid to each simplex always exists. When a complex of Lie algebroids is given, we de ne the notion of piecewise <b>smooth</b> <b>form</b> in a similar way to Whitney forms on a simplicial complex and the set of all piecewise <b>smooth</b> <b>forms</b> de ned on a complex of Lie algebroids is naturally equipped with a di erential, yielding a commutative di erential graded algebra. Its cohomology is, by de nition, the piecewise smooth cohomology of the Lie algebroid. Each <b>smooth</b> <b>form</b> de ned on the Lie algebroid gives a piecewise <b>smooth</b> <b>form</b> de ned on the corresponding complex of Lie algebroids by taking the restriction of the form to each simplex. This correspondence is a natural map from the usual algebra of the <b>smooth</b> <b>forms</b> of the Lie algebroid to the algebra of the piecewise <b>smooth</b> <b>forms</b> of the corresponding complex of Lie algebroids. Based on three crucial results, namely the triviality of a transitive Lie algebroid over a contractible smooth manifold (Mackenzie, Weinstein), the K unneth theorem for Lie algebroids (Kubarski) and the de Rham-Sullivan theorem for smooth manifolds, we show that this map is an isomorphism in cohomology...|$|R

One has a natural morphism Ω^∗(;M) →Ω^∗(;K) of cochain algebras given by restriction of a <b>smooth</b> <b>form</b> defined on to a <b>smooth</b> <b>form</b> defined on ^!!_Δ, for all simplices Δ of K.

40|$|In {{order to}} use CBN {{grinding}} wheels technologically and economically successful, their correct use preparation is of decisive importance. Systematic investigations when truing ceramic bonded CBN grinding wheels with a diamond <b>form</b> <b>roller</b> should show {{the influence of}} the process setting parameters and the contour inclination of the abrasive coating on the grinding result. Analogous considerations made it possible to carry out the tests using a single grinding wheel with a straight profile. In doing so, a loading of the abrasive coating was produced in axial direction by special grinding kinematics. The influence of the inclination angle on the coherence of the abrasive coating becomes clear particulary for the wear behaviour. A reason for this is the loading of the abrasive coating by an axial force component. What is more, {{the influence of the}} speed ratio on the performance of CBN grinding wheels was examined with a high-speed device for diamond <b>form</b> <b>rollers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The ink {{fountain}} stores {{a quantity of}} ink in a reservoir and feeds small quantities of ink to the distribution rollers from the {{ink fountain}} roller and the ink ductor roller. The ink ductor roller is a movable roller that moves {{back and forth between}} the ink fountain roller and an ink distribution roller. As the ductor contacts the ink fountain roller, both turn and the ductor is inked. The ductor then swings forward to contact an ink distribution roller and transfers ink to it. There are generally two types of ink distribution rollers: the ink rotating rollers (or ink transfer rollers), which rotate in one direction, and the ink oscillating rollers (or ink vibrating rollers), which rotate and move from side to side. The ink distribution rollers receive ink and work it into a semiliquid state that is uniformly delivered to the ink <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b> A thin layer of ink is then transferred to the image portions of the lithographic plate by the ink <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b>|$|R
