The range determination in active laser range finders, including slant range, is based on measuring the time difference of two time points, the time point when the pulse exits the laser range finders, and the time point when the pulse comes back, after being reflected from a target. The signal emission reflected from a target is a variable of random process, because of the irradiated surface length, even under narrow field radiation. When determining the <b>slant</b> range <b>distance</b> from aircraft to a target, {{it is necessary to}} identify the signal emission reflected from a target, from background signal reflected by underlying surface.

Title: Definition of Boundaries of Urban Areas using Delaunay Triangulation. Notes: 111 p., 5 tab., 87. fig. Key words: Delaunay triangulation, urban {{settlement}}, settlement boundary, GIS. Abstract This dissertation analyzes {{two different}} approaches, namely Delaunay triangulation and the buffer methodology, for {{the determination of}} the boundaries of urban settlements, and compares their advantages and shortcomings. We have developed a procedure for {{the determination of the}} boundaries of urban areas using Delaunay triangulation. The study was carried out on four suitable urban areas in Slovenia, namely Maribor, Jesenice, Postojna and Pivka. The study has taken into account some criteria for urban area boundary determination that had already been established, such as the maximal distance between buildings. In addition, it is introducing for the first time three-dimensional models that are using <b>slanted</b> <b>distances</b> between buildings. The computations and analyses were carried out using the computer program suite ArcGIS, on the basis of different renderings of spatial data, such as building registries and digital topography maps in the scale 1 : 25, 000. We collected data in all four chosen urban areas using Delaunay triangulation; we have used the results obtained using the buffer method from the study by Prosen and coworkers (2008) titled “The importance of small and medium sized cities for the development of urban areas”. Finally we compared the two sets of results, obtained using the two different methods, and evaluated the advantages and shortcomings of each of the two approaches. We found the Delaunay approach better, as it takes into amount <b>slanted</b> <b>distances</b> and altitudes, removes small data clusters (with areas smaller than 30, 000 m 2), calculates the results in 3 D and improves their 2 D rendering...|$|R

In this paper we examine methods to maximize data download by waiting to begin transmission at a non-intuitive high elevation angle. This elevation angle reduces the <b>slant</b> <b>distance</b> and allows the link to be closed at a higher fixed data rate.

The results of this study (analytic and numerical) are presented along with recommendations for strategies for max-imizing the amount of data transmitted for a given satellite orbit.

But the distortion of SAR image brought by elevation is very difficult to be corrected by polynomial rectification. In this paper, height displacement caused by elevation is corrected in advance according to the <b>slant</b> <b>distance</b> and elevation of each pixel, and the other distortion is corrected by polynomial rectification. Compared to other orthorectification algorithm on SAR image, it is very easy to implement. According to this method, programme has been designed.

40|$|Quantitative {{predictions}} of egocentric distance and geographical slant perception may {{be derived from}} dense coding (scale expansion) in angular variables (Durgin 2 ̆ 6 Li, 2011). In particular, distance/height matching tasks can {{be accounted for by}} measured biases in perceived direction (elevation) relative to the horizon (Li et al., 2011). However, substantial interest has accumulated for studies arguing that perception is affected by physiological factors such as BMI and age. We used a cross-sectional methodology to look at space perception across the adult lifespan (ages 18 - 72). We examined performance in several distance, height, and slant tasks including estimation and perceptual matching. We also measured factors concerning specialized knowledge (golfers and skiers know more about distance and slope estimation, respectively), physiology (age, BMI), and personality (e. g., Agreeableness) that might influence performance. Participants (N= 106) included college students (N= 58), but also non-student members of the nearby community (N= 48). Consistent with coding efficiency theory, <b>slant,</b> <b>distance</b> and height estimates closely accord with the angular expansion account: Distances were underestimated (0. 72 of actual distance); height was overestimated (1. 11 of actual height) and egocentric distance-height matching performance (mean ratio: 1. 53) accorded well with the ratio between estimate ratios (i. e., 1. 54). Contrary to the action-ability hypothesis, participants defined as obese by CDC guidelines (mean BMI = 35. 2) tended to underestimate distance more than those defined as normal. Slant overestimates were consistent with scale expansion, but were also affected reliably both by knowledge and by age. Although obese adults tended to give higher slant estimates, the reliable effect of age on slant estimation was opposite to the {{predictions of}} action ability (older adults gave lower slant estimates).

A new automated, spatially explicit, and physically-based method for calculating lengthscales of bed texture elements in sidescan echograms (a 2 D plot of acoustic intensity {{as a function of}} <b>slant</b> range and <b>distance)</b> is suggested.

The recursive application of the transform over small overlapping windows of the echogram provides a robust measure of lengthscales of alternating patterns of strong and weak echoes.

Rather, it is a statistical representation that integrates over many attributes of bed texture, of which grain size is the most important.

In fact, data shows that a functional property of neurons within primate visual cortices' are their discernment to orientation. In contrast, haptic orientation judgements are recovered through collaborated patterned stimulations, evidently an indirect source susceptible to interference. Likewise, when size is concerned haptic information coming from positions of the fingers is more immediate. Visual-size perceptions, alternatively, have to be computed using parameters such as <b>slant</b> and <b>distance.</b> Considering this, sensory dominance is a useful instinct to assist with calibration. During sensory immaturity, the more simple and robust information source {{could be used to}} tweak the accuracy of the alternate source. Follow-up work by Gori et al. (2012) showed that, at all ages, vision-size perceptions are near perfect when viewing objects within the haptic workspace (i.e. at arm's reach). However, systematic errors in perception appeared when the object was positioned beyond this zone. Children younger than 14 years tend to underestimate object size, whereas adults overestimated. However, if the object was returned to the haptic workspace, those visual biases disappeared. These results support the hypothesis that haptic information may educate visual perceptions. If sources are used for cross-calibration they cannot, therefore, be combined (integrated). Maintaining access to individual estimates is a trade-off for extra plasticity over accuracy, which could be beneficial in retrospect to the developing body.|$|R
