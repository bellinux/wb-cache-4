There are nine income tax brackets, ranging from 0.36% to 8.98%, {{as well as}} four {{corporate}} income tax brackets ranging from 6-12%, giving Iowa the country's highest marginal corporate tax rate. The state sales tax rate is 6%, with non-prepared food having no tax. Iowa has one local option sales tax that may be imposed by counties after an election.

50|$|The {{primitive}} {{financial institutions}} of early England centred round the king's household. In other words, the royal preceded {{the national economy}} in importance.

There is, however, little or no evidence of what modern governments recognise as financial organisation until the 11th century.

5000|$|The {{history of}} the English {{financial}} system consists mainly of the different flows over time of the above exchequer receipts. For example, a sheriff was bound to account twice yearly at the Exchequer for the royal revenues of his county (the [...] "county farm" [...] or corpus comitatis). During the {{century and a half}} that lay between the Norman Conquest and the granting of Magna Carta, this system operated well. Nevertheless, the character of the ruler affected the vigour of administration, both fiscal and general. For instance, the relatively popular Henry I and Henry II secured far better fiscal results than the unpopular and divisive kings Stephen and John, even though the collection of rents and profits from the royal demesne together with feudal and other dues continued as the mainstay of the revenue. However, indications of change are to be found, and the substitution of the carucage (or plough tax) for the Danegeld marks an advance towards direct taxation of land through its produce. Moreover, the introduction of scutage is not only further evidence of the same tendency, but also a step toward the development of a money-based economy to replace the earlier system of payments-in-kind. The tallage (or <b>special</b> <b>levies)</b> imposed on towns in the king's demesne at times of need appear to have been a doubtful exercise of the royal prerogative, albeit belonging scientifically to the same class as the Danegeld and scutage. Perhaps the most important advance made in this period was the beginning of taxation on movable goods, first applied in the Saladin tithe of 1189 later expanding into a general system.|$|E
5000|$|Some argue {{this tax}} has aided the ever-widening {{gap between the}} living {{standards}} {{of the rich and}} poor. Such arguments tell only part of the story. The argument may be appropriate for improperly <b>levied</b> <b>special</b> assessments, but appropriately <b>levied</b> <b>special</b> assessments require that the property owner benefit by a measurable increase in the property's market value. (See reference 1). The amount of tax is limited by that [...] "measurable" [...] increase in value. Also, as a general principle, most taxing legislation recognize the limited financial resources of the elderly, the handicapped and the disabled. Exemptions and deferments from the <b>special</b> <b>levy</b> have been created within some legislation. Arguments against the tax based upon living standards may not recognize the importance of providing clean drinking water or sewer services to land owners. Finally, such arguments may not fully consider the benefit to people, animals and plants in the ecosystem protected by a public improvement such as sewage treatment infrastructure. Poorly drafted tax legislation may very well create inappropriate burdens on a taxpayer and be viewed with disdain.|$|R

40|$|Political {{parties are}} the {{vehicles}} {{through which the}} ideals of multiparty democracy could be achieved in any fledgling democracy. But in Ghana, {{they are the most}} neglected of all the political institutions. Consequently they exist merely as “election machines” and become moribund during inter-election periods. The proposal for state funding of political parties was seen as a means of reinvigorating {{them to be able to}} function effectively and produce quality leaders capable of tackling the developmental challenges of the country. This paper therefore reviews the Draft Public Funding of Political Parties Bill, 2008. Through a survey of some 210 respondents and government officials, it argues that the quest for public funding of political parties was outmoded at conception because governments are not committed to the proposal, nor do Ghanaians seem to support it. The study concludes on the note that until politicians strive to reduce the perception of corruption against them and encourage their members to support them financially through the payment of monthly dues and <b>special</b> <b>levies,</b> political parties will continue to function as weak election machines in Ghana...|$|E
40|$|Education {{constitutes}} {{the most formidable}} industry in Ondo State. Since {{the creation of the}} State on February 3, 1976, education has been attracting the largest proportion of the total money earmarked for social services. Of all the levels of education in Ondo State, secondary education has been consuming a sizeable proportion of the total money earmarked for education. The State Government has been bearing a heavy financial burden of secondary education with minimum contribution from individuals. This heavy financial burden borne by the State government had its genesis in the abolition of tuition fees in Nigerian public schools in September, 1976, all over the country {{as a result of the}} introduction of the Universal Primary Education (Adesina 1980) and complete take-over of all schools from various voluntary agencies by the Government. Between 1979 and 1983 investment in secondary education in Ondo State took another dimension, when Governor Michael Adekunle Ajasin, under the now defunct Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) embarked on free secondary education program. During this period tuition fees, textbook fees, development fees and all <b>special</b> <b>levies</b> were abolished.

The ‘Deepwater Golden Triangle’ of the North American Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and West Africa has been leading the most exploration, development and investment activities in the world, and their experience on fiscal system during different development stages has great reference value other than advanced technologies.
