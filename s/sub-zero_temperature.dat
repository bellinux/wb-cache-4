We were into a twelve-bar trip and early Ten Years After-style stuff. So it's part of that sort of trip. Then there's the heavy thing and the rock thing. It's not just steamhammer headbanging stuff all the way through ... We got rid of all our inner frustrations: what each of us individually wanted to put down over the years but couldn't because of the pressures of work. So we put a lot of painstaking hours into developing this album." [...] However, Osbourne quickly soured on the LP, telling After Hours in a 1981 interview [...] "The last album I did with Sabbath was Never Say Die! and it was the worst piece of work that I've ever had anything to do with.

This created an adverse tactical position. On the night of 23 June 1987, the assault team under Major Varinder Singh managed to make an approach adopting the most difficult route to the 700 feet high vertical ice-wall on the Saltoro Ridge, and next night negotiated the ice wall and reached just 200 metres from the top.The advance was resumed at 2100 hours on 25 June 1987 and under intense fire his party managed to capture the bunker after lobbying grenades at 0200 hours on 26 June 1987. It was their third night in the open <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperature.</b> By 0500 hours, Major Varinder Singh's assault team captured the second bunker after firing twenty rounds of 84 M M Rocket Launcher. He pressed on the attack, providing supporting fire cover while a small party led by Naib Subedar Bana Singh crawled to the last bunker and after a ferocious charge captured it. While mopping up operations were in progress, there was a heavy artillery shelling by the adversary's troops in which the officer was badly wounded. Undeterred by his wounds, Major Varinder Singh assumed control of the Area Top by 1600 hours on 26 June 1987, thus regaining tactical superiority over the adversary. Major Varinder Singh displayed conspicuous courage and valiant leadership {{in the face of the}} adversary.|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} {{available in}} the Western Canadian adapted Brassica napus germplasm has decreased substantially in recent years, leading plant breeders to search for new sources of diversity. This study aims {{to determine whether the}} relevant agronomic traits as well as increased <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperature</b> tolerance can be combined {{within the context of a}} European winter-type by Australian spring-type Brassica napus doubled-haploid (DH) population containing 115 DH lines. The hypothesis is that DH individuals will be found that possess <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperature</b> tolerance as well as early flowering and maturity. There are three major objectives in this research: 1) characterization of the agronomic traits of this population including flowering times and maturity using field experiments, 2) evaluation of <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperature</b> tolerance using field experiments, and 3) evaluation of low temperature germination ability using laboratory experiments. Analysis of the agronomic, <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperature</b> tolerance and germination data together suggests that, since there are examples in this particular population, it is possible to combine increased <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperature</b> tolerance with early maturity in a spring-like growth habit. The combination of increased <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperature</b> tolerance, lack of vernalization requirement and early maturity in an otherwise winter-type genetic background represents another step in germplasm development within Brassica napus...|$|E
40|$|Cold {{tolerant}} polar terrestrial arthropods {{have evolved}} {{a range of}} survival strategies which enable them to survive the most extreme environmental conditions (cold and drought) {{they are likely to}} encounter. Some species are classified as being freeze tolerant but the majority of those found in the Antarctic survive <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperatures</b> by avoiding freezing by supercooling. For many arthropods, not just polar species, survival of desiccating conditions is equally important to survival of low <b>temperatures.</b> At <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperatures</b> freeze avoiding arthropods are susceptible to desiccation and may lose water due to a vapour diffusion gradient between their supercooled body fluids and ice in their surroundings. This process ceases once the body fluids are frozen and so is not a problem for freeze tolerant species. This paper compares five polar arthropods, which have evolved different low temperature survival strategies, and the effects of exposure to <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperatures</b> on their supercooling points (SCP) and water contents. The Antarctic oribatid mite (Alaskozetes antarcticus) reduced its supercooling point temperature from - 6 to - 30 degreesC, when exposed to decreasing <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperatures</b> (cooled from 5 to - 10 degreesC over 42 days) with little loss of body water during that period. However, Cryptopygus antarcticus, a springtail which occupies similar habitats in the Antarctic, showed a decrease in both water content and supercooling ability when exposed to the same experimental protocol. Both these Antarctic arthropods have evolved a freeze avoiding survival strategy. The Arctic springtail (Onychiurus arcticus), which is also freeze avoiding, dehydrated (from 2. 4 to 0. 7 g water g(- 1) dry weight) at <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperatures</b> and its SCP was lowered from c. - 3 to below - 15 degreesC in direct response to temperature (5 to - 5. 5 degreesC). In contrast, the freeze tolerant larvae of an Arctic fly (Heleomyza borealis) froze at c. - 7 degreesC with little change in water content or SCP during further cold exposure and survived frozen to - 60 degreesC. The partially freeze tolerant sub-Antarctic beetle Hydromedion sparsutum froze at c. - 2 degreesC and is known to survive frozen to - 8 degreesC. During the subzero temperature treatment, its water content reduced until it froze and then remained constant. The survival strategies of such freeze tolerant and freeze avoiding arthropods are discussed in relation to desiccation at <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the evolution of strategies of cold tolerance...|$|R

40|$|The soil-structure {{interface}} between structures and frozen soil ground {{is an important}} element to the structure safety in permafrost regions. This interface is usually subjected to a constant normal stress and cyclic shear loadings such as seismic, wind, and wave loadings. Hence, the cyclic direct shear behaviors of this interface have critical impacts on the safety and durability of the structure. This paper investigated the cyclic direct shear behaviors of an artificial frozen soil-structure interface under four constant normal stresses and four sub-zero temperatures by using a large-scale multi-functional direct shear apparatus. Cyclic shear stress and normal displacement were measured under normal stresses of 100, 300, 500, and 700 kPa and at sub-zero temperatures of − 2, − 6, − 10, and − 14 °C, respectively. These measurements revealed the following mechanical properties of this artificial interface: (1) The maximum shear stress is always observed in the initial stage of the first cycle. This maximum shear stress is linearly related to the normal stress. (2) Both the internal friction angle and the cohesion of this interface at the maximum shear stress decrease {{with the increase of}} <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperature.</b> (3) The internal friction angle decreases with further cycles. This angle becomes significantly smaller in the stabilized cycles than that in the first cycle. (4) The maximum dilation measured by normal displacement is always observed in the first cycle. This dilation is decreasing with higher normal stress and at lower <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperature.</b> However, the final normal displacement always contracts and its magnitude increases with the increase of normal stress or the decrease of <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperature.</b> Finally, a simple damage model is proposed to describe these behaviors of this artificial interface and its performance is checked through its prediction for experimental data...|$|E

For comparison, similar tests were also conducted on coarse-grained AA 1070 aluminum samples. 3 D- and 2 D-ECAP dies were used to deform the initial coarse-grained aluminum to total equivalent plastic strains of ca. 10 using routes Bc and C+Bc, respectively. The ECAP processing increased {{the strength of the}} material substantially {{but at the same time}} reduced its strain hardening capability. After initial yielding, strain softening took place in all studied UFG materials at quasi- static strain rates, but at high strain rates (above 103 s- 1) notable strain hardening was observed. Strain hardening was further enhanced by <b>sub-zero</b> <b>temperatures,</b> at least at high strain rates.
