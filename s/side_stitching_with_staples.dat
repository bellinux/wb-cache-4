50|$|Most of the time, <b>side</b> <b>stitches</b> {{occur on}} the right side of the body. This may be because the largest organ in the {{abdominal}} cavity, the liver, is on that side. Certain athletes also report a pain in the tip of their shoulder blade. This is believed to be because this is a referred site of pain for the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve. When the <b>side</b> <b>stitch</b> is {{on the right side}}, published advice is to try to exhale when the left foot lands.|$|R
50|$|Of {{clinical}} relevance, {{one cause}} of exercise-induced pain in one's left <b>side</b> (a <b>side</b> <b>stitch)</b> is stretching of this ligament and the peritoneum when the spleen swells from exertion.|$|R

50|$|There {{are other}} {{theories}} regarding <b>side</b> <b>stitches</b> than simple stretching of the visceral ligaments due to repeated vertical translation and jolting. Such theories include diaphragmatic ischemia, imbalances of the thoracic spine, irritation of the parietal peritoneum and strain on visceral ligaments by a fluid-engorged gut.|$|R

2500|$|Perineal rectosigmoidectomy aims to resect (remove) the {{redundant}} bowel via the perineum and {{anchor the}} lower rectum to the sacrum through fibrosis {{in the hope}} of preventing future prolapse. The full thickness of the rectal wall is incised at a level just above the dentate line. Redundant rectal and sigmoid wall is removed and the new edge of colon is reconnected (anastomosed) with the anal canal <b>with</b> <b>stitches</b> or <b>staples.</b> This procedure may be combined with a procedure to tighten the pelvic muscles (levatorplasty). A combined a perineal proctosigmoidectomy with anterior levatoroplasty is also called an Altemeier procedure. Levatorplasty is performed to correct elvator diastasis which is commonly associated with rectal prolapse. Perineal rectosigmoidectomy was first introduced by Mikulicz in 1899, and it remained the preferred treatment in Europe for many years. It was Popularized by Altemeier. The procedure is simple, safe and effective. Continence Levatorplasty may enhance restoration of continence (2/3 of patients). Complications occur in less than 10% of cases, and include pelvic bleeding, pelvic abscess and anastomotic dehiscence (splitting apart of the stitches inside), bleeding or leak at a dehiscence Mortality is low. Recurrence rates are higher than for abdominal repair, 16-30%, but more recent studies give lower recurrence rates. Additional levatoroplasty [...] can reduce recurrence rates to 7%.|$|R

40|$|The {{places of}} contact of the LAC-repressor with DNA have been determined. It has been detected, {{that in the}} {{specific}} complex of the LAC-repressor with LAC-operator only lysin- 33 forms the <b>stitch</b> <b>with</b> the partially depurinized DNA, while in all unspecific complexes the N-end of the repressor is being <b>stitched</b> <b>with</b> DNA also. The method of localization of the places of <b>stitching</b> <b>with</b> protein on the DNA has been developed. It has been shown, that in the triple complex inductor-repressor-operator, the N-end of the protein is <b>stitching</b> <b>with</b> {{the edges of the}} LAC-operator. The amino acids are able to <b>stitch</b> only <b>with</b> those modified sites of the DNA, with which they are close in the composition of the DNA-protein complex. Using the obtained results, the conclusion has been made about, that exactly interaction with LAC-operator brings to such orientation of the DNA-connecting domains of the repressor, which had been found earlier by the NMR method. In the presence of the inductor this orientation is opposite. The inductor stabilizes the inverted orientation, preventing from its variation when coupling the protein with the operator. Such is the structural base of switching-out of the LAC-repressor under the inductor actionAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
