5000|$|Sheet metal {{ductwork}} for conveying air in HVAC systems typically uses gendered connections. Typically, the airflow {{through a}} ductwork connection is from male to female. However, since one-way flow is implemented by forced-air fans or blowers, [...] "backwards" [...] gendered connections {{can be seen}} frequently in some systems, since all connections are typically sealed with duct <b>sealing</b> <b>mastic</b> or tape to prevent leakage anyway. The flow convention is usually loosely adhered to for simplicity of design, and {{to reduce the number}} of gender changer fittings required, but exceptions are made whenever expedient.|$|E
5000|$|Air is {{circulated}} through ductwork, {{which may}} be made of sheet metal or plastic [...] "flex" [...] duct, and is insulated or uninsulated. Unless the ducts and plenum have been <b>sealed</b> using <b>mastic</b> or foil duct tape, the ductwork {{is likely to have}} a high leakage of conditioned air, possibly into unconditioned spaces. Another cause of wasted energy is the installation of ductwork in unheated areas, such as attics and crawl spaces; or ductwork of air conditioning systems in attics in warm climates.|$|R
40|$|This Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC) study, {{conducted}} {{under the}} auspices of the U. S. Department of Energy's Building America Industrialized Housing Partnership (BAIHP), compares <b>mastic</b> <b>sealed</b> duct systems to tape sealed systems by showing measured total duct leakage (CFM 25 TOTAL and QnTOTAL) and/or measured leakage to the outside (CFM 25 OUT and QnOUT) in 190 manufactured home floors or home sections. All manufacturers were considering or actively working toward achieving duct leakage below 3 % of the conditioned floor area (QnOUT= 0. 03), consistent with Energy Star Manufactured Homes criteria. Previous field tests suggest that CFM 25 OUT accounts for about half of CFM 25 TOTAL. These data show that achieving CFM 25 TOTAL= 6 % during production was generally correlated with achieving CFM 25 OUT= 3 % in <b>mastic</b> <b>sealed</b> systems, but less reliably with taped systems. Cost for achieving duct tightness goals range from $ 4 to $ 8 including duct testing on the assembly lin...|$|R
5000|$|At {{construction}} stage, the airtightness {{of individual}} components {{depends on the}} design (rectangular or round ducts, pressed or segmented bends, etc.) and assembly (seam type and welding quality). Components with factory-fitted sealing devices (e.g., gaskets, clips) meant to ease and accelerate the installation process are widely used in Scandinavian countries. A variety of techniques are widely used to tighten duct systems on site, including gaskets, tapes, <b>sealing</b> compound (<b>mastic),</b> internal duct lining, aerosol duct sealing. So-called [...] "duct tapes" [...] are often not suited for sealing ducts, which explains why, in the US, the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) requires any tape used on duct board or flexible ducts to be labeled in accordance with UL 181A or 181B.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of surface}} damage {{can be found}} {{exclusively}} underneath the pavement markings such as lane markings and turn-lane arrows. There is no definitive explanation {{of the relationship between}} pavement markings and surface deterioration, but there are several hypotheses. One is that water vapor may have been trapped underneath the road surface markings, causing the de-bonding of asphalt binder from the aggregate materials. Another hypothesis is that the reflectivity of the markings may create differences in solar heating and thermal expansion strains between the areas with and without markings. Small flaws caused by differential strains may be combined into longitudinal cracks along the markings. There are certain surface treatments that can make the road surface less susceptible to this type of distresses, such as slurry <b>seals</b> and stone <b>mastic</b> asphalt.|$|R
25|$|In June 2009, c2c and Bombardier began a {{repainting}} programme on the Class 357 units {{beginning with}} 357 203. When the vinyl wraps were {{taken off the}} Class 357 units, slight corrosion caused by water getting trapped behind the vinyl {{was found in the}} aluminium around the doors, so a bodywork maintenance and repair programme was carried out. The corrosion was treated by rubbing the aluminium down and repainting it with two-pack paint. More serious corrosion caused by water seeping in through a poorly-sealed join between panels was found behind several panels on {{the lower part of the}} vehicle bodysides, which had spread to the outside. A thick, tight <b>mastic</b> <b>seal</b> was introduced between the panels to prevent this issue from re-occurring. To save money during construction, stainless steel bolts were used to secure the external aluminium panels in place; however, this resulted in galvanic corrosion of the more reactive aluminium, so the bolts have been replaced by aluminium ones. Salts in water catalyse corrosion, a problem for the c2c fleet as they run beside the sea.|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} a multi-year research {{effort to}} develop a leak-free duct system that can be readily installed within the thermal envelope. There are numerous efforts underway to improve duct system efficiency. Most of these involve modifications to current technology such as air <b>sealing</b> techniques like <b>mastic</b> and aeroseal, snap together duct connections, and greater levels of insulation. This project sought to make a more significant stride forward by introducing a duct system of a material that can be more readily sealed and can exhibit lower friction losses. The research focused {{on the use of}} smooth internal surface, low friction plastic ducts that could be easily installed with very low air leakage. The initial system concept that was proposed and researched in Phase I focused on the use of thermoformed plastic ducts installed in a recessed roof truss underneath the attic insulation. A bench top thermoformed system was developed and tested during Phase I of the project. In Phase II, a first generation duct system utilizing a resin impregnated fiberglass duct product was designed and specified. The system was installed and tested in an Atlanta area home. Following this installation research and correspondence with code officials was undertaken to alleviate the continued concern over the code acceptance of plastic ducts in above ground applications. A Committee Interpretation response was received from the International Code Council (ICC) stating that plastic ducts were allowed, but must be manufactured from materials complying with Class 0 or Class 1 rating. With assurance of code acceptance, a plastic duct system using rotomolded high density polyethylene ducts that had passed the material test requirements by impregnating the material with a fire retardant during the molding process was installed {{in the basement of a}} new ranch-style home in Madison, WI. A series of measurements to evaluate the performance benefits relative to a similar control house with a standard sheet metal installation were made...|$|R
