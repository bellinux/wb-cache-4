2500|$|The two hide in some {{weeds and}} ambush {{a young man}} who looks much like Iverson did. The boy stops the Captain from killing him, as the {{traveler}} is far too young.

The Captain refuses the second toast, cursing Iverson. <b>Sheads</b> reveals himself to be Iverson's nephew. Iverson comes down, and the nephew kills Montgomery when he draws a revolver on Iverson. [...] About to bury the Captain, Iverson orders <b>Sheads</b> to kill the scout as well, to silence all witnesses, when the very earth begins moving and opening up. With its teeth, it seizes and devours <b>Sheads.</b> Iverson attempts to escape on his horse and kill the Scout, but he hurls a lantern at Iverson, distracting him. The pits take Iverson and his horse, and the Scout eventually becomes a historian specializing in Gettysburg.|$|R
