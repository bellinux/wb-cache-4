40|$|Unlike {{many other}} countries, where {{the nuclear power}} plants have a finite period of time {{foreseen}} in their operating licence, the authorization in Belgium is delivered without time limitation but on condition of a safety reassessment process at definite intervals of ten years. Important repairs, replacements and modifications (steam generator replacement, seismic re-evaluation and requalification, RCS overpressure protection and process computers) are mainly associated with these 10 -year reviews. Beyond those major changes, the follow-up of equipment is performed on a case-by-case basis. <b>Specific</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> {{have been developed for}} sensible equipment to cope with new loading or degrading phenomena (erosion-corrosion, intergranular attack stress corrosion, weal; stratification, etc.).

40|$|The {{productivity}} of Ria de Aveiro is {{sustained by the}} large quantities of dissolved inorganic nutrients, mainly from freshwater inputs (e. g. agricultural drainage) and organic-rich anthropogenic point sources (e. g. urban sewage). The concentration of silicate and nitrate showed a similar seasonal variation and conservative behaviour, since 63 to 96 % {{of the total variance}} of the concentration of silicate and 88 to 96 % of the total variance of the concentration of nitrate were explained by salinity. On the other hand, the concentration of nitrite, ammonium, and phosphate did not seem dependent on the freshwater inputs, showing a random distribution with salinity. Nutrient concentrations were always higher in the two inner areas than at the outer boundary of the system. Chlorophyll a showed higher concentrations throughout spring and summer, and also in the inner areas. The annual variation of N:P, N:Si and phytoplankton biomass suggests that there is a large excess of nitrate. The results suggest that within a system with low overall eutrophic condition (OEC) and low susceptibility (US-NEEA index), the quality status of different areas within the system can vary (Applying the EU-WFD criteria proposed for the trophic classification of the Baltic Sea). This work also suggests that in coastal lagoons such as Ria de Aveiro, where the quality status of certain specific areas may vary, these particular areas should be taken under consideration for <b>specific</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> and management measurements, particularly with regard to anthropogenic point sources...|$|E
40|$|Halyomorpha halys is an {{invasive}} polyphagous pest {{with a high}} {{negative impact}} on fruit orchards and other agricultural crops in the USA. In Italy, it was first detected in 2012 in Emilia Romagna, a northern region that is among the major European tree fruit production areas. A <b>specific</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> using active techniques {{was carried out in}} pear orchards and adjacent uncultivated areas between 2014 and 2016 to assess the abundance, seasonality and impact of H. halys and other phytophagous Heteroptera in the field. It emerged that just a few years after first discovery, this invasive species already largely outnumbers all the other Heteroptera and that it is a season-long pest for pear crops. Severe yield losses are reported in different farms, especially on the orchard borders, with more than 50 % deformed fruits. Mirids are mostly found in the grassy areas and crops, and the other phytophagous Heteroptera, only occasionally detected in the orchard trees, occur mainly on hedges and other crops. Our survey demonstrates {{for the first time the}} great damaging potential of H. halys as a new key pest of orchards in southern Europe. The study also identified the patterns of seasonal abundance of adults and nymphs in the orchards and their uncultivated surroundings, providing baseline data for the development of specific strategies for sustainable management...|$|R

Aim of the workshop was to discuss the functionality of monitoring systems as desired by risk managers and policy makers, {{in relation to the}} available methods, existing information databases and research tools. The programme of the workshop included presentations on backgrounds of monitoring, on information needs among the risk managers and policy makers, on developments in (physical) environment and in public health research, on health impact indicators of environmental pollution, and on the functionality of monitoring systems. Furthermore, based on examples of <b>specific</b> <b>monitoring</b> questions, the participants discussed about the effect-sizes to detect and the implications for the sizes of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme,</b> and the consequences of false-positive and false-negative results for the decisions based on these results. In the main discussion {{at the end of the}} workshop it was emphasized that each monitoring activity should be tested against the criteria discussed in the workshop. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> should be set up very selectively, on a situation-specific basis. Initiators of <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> can be both risk managers/policy makers and researchers; in the design phase it is crucial to have consultations between both parties about the objectives, expectations about effect-size to be detected by the monitoring system, feasibility and reliability of a <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> in terms of type-I and type-II errors.

Electrocardiographic recordings {{were carried out}} using an electrocardiograph with a deflection of 10 mm/mV and a paper speed of 25 mm/sec.

How does the <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> help to meet the UK obligations under the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer? 2. Are the data currently collected in the <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> fit for purpose? If not, what measures could be employed to make the data fit for purpose? Are there any activities in the current <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> which are no longer needed? 3. Are the current measurement techniques viable into the future (over a 5 - 20 year timescale), and what other techniques/instruments are available? 4. Are current methodologies for disseminating information sufficient?

40|$|The recent move to in situ {{conservation}} management world-wide {{is supported}} by, and stems from the 1992 International Convention on Biological Diversity. The Department of Conservation - charged with the conservation of New Zealand's natural resources - has directed efforts towards the restoration of natural processes as an avenue to halt local biodiversity decline. Ecosystem, habitat, and nature restoration programmes such as the Boundary Stream Mainland Island Project (BSMIP) represent the forefront of conservation management, combining intensive multi-species pest control, with broad-scale hierarchical <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> confer information that is intended to support decision-making and management by the reduction of uncertainty, or by increasing knowledge. The validity of <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> depends on three key parts; the guiding objectives, biological relevance, and statistical reliability. Seven major long-term <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> established at the BSMIP were evaluated {{according to the above}} criteria. All <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> had appropriate guiding objectives, and were biologically relevant (outcome and result monitoring were balanced respective {{to each other and to}} the restoration intervention and efforts at BSMIP). The statistical reliability of the programmes was appraised with the use of the Computer <b>programme</b> <b>MONITOR,</b> which provided a calculated value for the statistical power of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes.</b> All <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> except two (Lizard monitoring: which was initially designed as a short-term species survey, and Mustelid monitoring: which would be a good candidate for a double sampling methodology) had a robust design (evaluated using the actual initial data, and conservative criteria for the detection of population change). The <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> that did achieve a level of statistical robustness, provided a statistical power of 0. 8 (80 %) within appropriate timeframes for restoration of ecosystem processes (e. g. the timeframe for detection of a 10 % change in the abundance, density, relative index, etc of the Result monitoring programmes: Rodents = three years, Possums = six years, and Outcome monitoring programmes: Weta = five years, Ground Invertebrates = four years, Birds (species nos.) = four years, Vegetation (Species, and sapling nos.) = 15 years). The guiding objectives for <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> must have clear, specific, measurable, and achievable goals, in-order to identify appropriate variables, in both spatial and temporal scales. The biological relevance or "linkage" between monitored groups is important and must be at least outlined, for <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> to be able to identify potential cause and effect. Statistical reliability (the balance between statistical significance, statistical power, and the timeframe for a conclusive result to be determined) is important, as it is the key method of detecting change. Statistical power can improve the design and efficiency of <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> and clarify research results.

The <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> in Ireland pre Water Framework Directive (WFD) were structured on a salinity-based typology, with an emphasis on quantifying the variability of the component elements. Although monitoring is a significant obligation under the WFD, there is little guidance on developing monitoring protocols; Member States are developing ad hoc <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme.</b> The Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), responsible authority, undertook research programmes to assist design and implementation of the WFD. A substantial new national <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> was developed. However, the Irish programme is not optimised; the programme is being refined to include elements not yet covered, notably the biota.

This article reviews {{the suitability of}} a range of bioindicators for use in <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> that link changes in water quality to changes in the condition of coral-reef ecosystems. From the literature, 21 candidate bioindicators were identified, whose responses to changes in water quality varied spatially and temporally; responses ranged from rapid (hours) changes within individual corals to long-term (years) changes in community composition. From this list, the most suitable bioindicators were identified by determining whether responses were (i) specific, (ii) monotonic, (iii) variable, (iv) practical and (v) ecologically relevant to management goals. For long-term <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> that aim to quantify the effects of chronic changes in water quality, 11 bioindicators were selected: symbiont photophysiology, colony brightness, tissue thickness and surface rugosity of massive corals, skeletal elemental and isotopic composition, abundance of macro-bioeroders, micro- and meiobenthic organisms such as foraminifera, coral recruitment, macroalgal cover, taxonomic richness of corals and the maximal depth of coralreef development. For short-term <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes,</b> or environmental impact assessments that aim to quantify the effects of acute changes in water quality, a subset of seven of these bioindicators were selected, including partial mortality.
