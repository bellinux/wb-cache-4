40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: The {{removal of}} heavy metals {{contaminated}} in aqueous solution/wastewater has been causing worldwide concern. However, the adsorbent materials are usually limited {{due to their}} high cost and environmentally benign. To overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages, low-cost and effective adsorbents are in demand. Approach: In this study, the <b>sea</b> <b>mussel</b> shells/natural clay beads were prepared for using as low-cost sorbent to remove Cd in the synthetic wastewater. Results: The sorbent were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The adsorption of Cd(II) ions from aqueous solution onto adsorbent has been investigated using kinetic approach to evaluate the effect of initial concentration and contact time on the removal of Cd. In adsorption studies, residual Cd(II) ion concentration reached equilibrium in duration of 240 min for initial Cd concentration of 5 ppm. The maximum removal achieves 99. 75 mg g− 1. Conclusion/Recommendations: The present {{results suggest that the}} adsorbent derived from <b>sea</b> <b>mussel</b> shells/natural clay bead is expected to be an economical material for removal of Cd(II) ions effectively from contaminated water...|$|R
50|$|Gooseneck {{barnacles}} {{compete with}} a number of other organisms in a complex struggle for survival in the limited available space in their rocky intertidal habitat. The first colonisers of bare rock are usually annual algae, soon to be followed by perennial species including coralline algae. Gooseneck barnacles, <b>sea</b> <b>mussels</b> and several species of acorn barnacles soon follow. Further competition is provided by sea palms, the large holdfasts of which may smother or squeeze out the molluscs and barnacles. Sea palms may settle on the mussels and may be carried away in storms, taking the mussels with them. Gooseneck barnacles may limit the colonisation of mussel recruits by feeding on their larvae. In areas where gooseneck barnacles predominate they may dominate until some are swept away in storms and allow in other species. In the long term, the mussels usually come to dominate as their byssal threads are able to overgrow all the other sessile organisms.|$|E
50|$|The Neversink River {{contains}} {{a large population}} of <b>sea</b> <b>mussels</b> and the richest diversity of freshwater mussels in the upper Delaware River Basin. However, {{one of the seven}} species of mussels found in the Neversink River, the dwarf wedgemussel, is on the federal list of endangered species. This situation was not being aided by the mussels being collected by the abandoned Cuddebackville Dam. The collection of mussel species near the dam was resulting in the Neversink River’s mussel population being primarily concentrated in one area, instead being well distributed throughout the river. Before the removal of the dam, not one dwarf wedgemussel could be found beyond the dam. This was making the mussels highly susceptible to extinction. A catastrophic flood, oil spill, chemical spill, or epidemic could have resulted in local extinction of the mussel populations in the Neversink River. The threat that the dam posed on the mussel life, particularly the Dwarf Wedge Mussel was one of the primary reasons for its removal.|$|E

40|$|Nutrient loads {{from the}} land to the sea must be reduced to combat coastal eutrophication. It has been {{suggested}} that further mitigation efforts are needed in the brackish Baltic Sea to decrease nutrients, especially in eutrophic coastal areas. Mussel farming is a potential measure to remove nutrients directly from the <b>sea.</b> <b>Mussels</b> consume phytoplankton containing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P); when the mussels are harvested these nutrients are removed from the aquatic system. However, sedimentation of organic material in faeces and pseudo-faeces below a mussel farm consumes oxygen and can lead to hypoxic or even anoxic sediments causing an increased sediment release of ammonium and phosphate. Moreover, N losses from denitrification can be reduced due to low oxygen and reduced numbers of bioturbating organisms. To reveal if mussel farming is a cost-effective mitigation measure in the Baltic Sea the potential for enhanced sediment nutrient release must be assessed...|$|E

Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione (GSH), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were measured in gills and digestive glands after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days of exposure.

From a suite of samples collected daily from 16 October to 11 November 2004, ∆ 14 C values averaged 32. 1 ± 4. 4 ‰. Freshwater input from the Santa Ana River to our site caused ∆ 14 C and δ 13 C values to decrease. Since this initial set of measurements, a time-series site has been maintained from November 2004 to the present. Surface seawater has been collected bimonthly and analyzed for ∆ 14 C, δ 13 C, salinity, and ?CO 2 concentrations. Water samples from the Santa Ana River were collected during the wet season.

After a decline recolonization or restoration starts from small patches of single shoots which then propagate vegetatively. We investigated the effects of plant density within a patch and nutrient resources on growth and survival of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.), the dominant seagrass species in the northern temperate zone. We created small (0. 5 m(2)) eelgrass patches by planting single shoots in circular plots at high (20 cm) and low (40 cm distance between shoots) density. In a factorial design, the sediment was nutrient-enriched (1) through biodeposition of transplanted mussels (Mytilus edulis L.) (2) by a slow-release NPK-fertilizer or (3) not enriched. The experiment was run over 1 growth period at a relatively nutrient-poor site (< 30 mu mol NH 4 + l(- 1) porewater) in the Baltic <b>Sea.</b> <b>Mussels</b> increased NH 4 + concentrations and the fertilizer increased both NH 4 + and PO 43 - in the sediment porewater and the overlying water column, but this had only limited effects on eelgrass shoot growth rates and increase in shoot density, which were high overall (up to 75 mm shoot(- 1) d(- 1), doubling shoot density every 3 mo). In contrast, increased plant density had clear positive effects on shoot growth, areal expansion of patches and increase in shoot density. These results suggest that nutrient availability is not a major factor in eelgrass patch colonization or survival in the Baltic.
