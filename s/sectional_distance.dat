40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} for surface recovery from planar sectional contours. The surface is reconstructed based on the so-called &quot;Equal Importance Criterion&quot;, which suggests that every point in the region contributes equally to the reconstruction process. The problem is then formulated {{in terms of a}} partial differential equation, and the solution is efficiently calculated from distance transform. To make the algorithm valid for different application purposes, both the isosurface and the primitive representations of the object surface are derived. The isosurface is constructed by interpolating between <b>sectional</b> <b>distance</b> transformations. The primitive are approximated by Voronoi Diagram transformation of the surface space. Isosurfaces have the advantage that subsequent geometric analysis of the object can be easily carried out while primitives representation is easy to be visualized. The proposed technique allows for surface recovery at any desired resolution, thus, inherent problems due to correspondence, tiling, and branching are avoided...|$|E

It {{is made up of}} various recognised <b>sectional</b> long <b>distance</b> coastal trails such as those that are referred to below, and paths that are not recognised as belonging to a formal long distance way.|$|R
40|$|A {{computer-based}} {{tool for}} visualisation of the vocal-tract, during speech articulation, {{by means of}} a midsagittal view of the human head has been designed and developed. The vocal tract graphics are generated using a new approach that is based on estimating both the area functions and the formant frequencies from the acoustic speech signal. First, it is assumed that the speech production process is an autoregressive model. Using a linear prediction analysis, the vocal tract area functions and the first three formants are estimated. The estimated area functions are then mapped to corresponding mid-sagittal distances and displayed as 2 D vocal tract lateral graphics. The mapping process is based on a simple numerical algorithm and an accurate reference grid derived from x-rays for the pronunciation of a number English vowels uttered by different speakers. To compensate for possible errors in the estimated area functions due to variation in vocal tract length between speakers, the first two <b>sectional</b> <b>distances</b> are determined by the three formants. Experimental results show high correlation with x-ray data and the PARAFAC analysis. The tool also displays other speech parameters that are closely related to the production of intelligible speech and hence would be useful as a visual feedback aid for speech training of hearing–impaired individuals and children with speech impediment.

40|$|We {{prove that}} {{for any given}} {{homotopic}} C 1 -maps u, v: G → M in a nontrivial homotopy class from a metric graph into a closed manifold of negative <b>sectional</b> curvature, the <b>distance</b> between u and v can be bounded by 3 (length(u) + length(v)) + C(κ, ρ/ 20), where ρ> 0 is a lower bound of the injectivity radius and −κ< 0 an upper bound for the sectional curvature of M. The constant C(κ, ε) is given by C(κ, ε) = 8 sh− 1 κ(1) + 8 sh− 1 κ (1 /shκ(ε)) with shκ(t) = sinh(√κ t). Various applications are given...|$|R
