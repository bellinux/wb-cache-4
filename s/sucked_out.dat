5|$|Goldfinger {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1958 and was the longest typescript Fleming had {{produced}} to that time. He initially gave the manuscript the title The Richest Man in the World. Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger's first encounter. Similarly, the depressurisation of Goldfinger's plane was another plot device he had intended to use elsewhere, but which {{found its way into}} Goldfinger. Some years previously a plane had depressurised over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been <b>sucked</b> <b>out</b> of the window and Fleming, who was not a comfortable airline passenger, had made note of the incident to use it.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Riley and {{her parents}} move to San Francisco for her father's new business. Riley has poor first experiences: the new house is cramped and old, the moving van with all their {{belongings}} is misdirected, her father is under stress from his business, and a poor encounter at a pizza restaurant leaves her disheartened. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness accidentally causes Riley to cry {{in front of her}} class, creating a sad core memory. Joy, panicking, tries to dispose of it, but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are <b>sucked</b> <b>out</b> of Headquarters, and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory.|$|E
5|$|Each dream {{acts as a}} {{character}} study, exploring the fears and future of the dreamer. Willow, Xander, and Giles are stalked by a shadowy figure, then killed within their dreams. The way in which each is killed {{is directly related to}} the role they had assumed when melding with Buffy in the previous episode—that role is indicated by the Tarot-like card used to symbolize the character's essence. Willow's card had been Spiritus, representing her magical powers; she is killed by having her spirit <b>sucked</b> <b>out</b> of her. Xander's card had been Animus, representing his heart; he is killed by having his heart ripped out. Giles had been represented by the card Sophus, a symbol of his intellect and role as teacher; he is killed by being scalped. Buffy's card, Manus, was representative of her physical strength. In her dream the stalker is revealed as the primitive, first slayer, who confronts her aggressively. The two fight, but the First Slayer is defeated when Buffy realizes a key difference between them: the First Slayer was alone and isolated, while Buffy is unique among Slayers in that she has friends and a life beyond slaying, factors which make her the greatest Slayer ever.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the total}} {{radioactivity}} of {{a dose of}} I-131 is usually high, and because the local beta radiation of nearby stomach tissue from an undissolved capsule is high, I-131 is usually administered to human patients in a small drink containing a few ounces of fluid(or alternatively in Capsule form). Liquid form administration is often slowly and carefully <b>sucked</b> <b>out</b> of a shielded container to prevent spillage. For administration to animals (for example, cats with hyperthyroidism), for practical reasons the isotope must be administered by injection.|$|E
25|$|Haliplidae larvae have a {{long and}} slender body with a tough exoskeleton. They can be {{recognized}} by their specialized mouthparts, carried on a small head. The maxillae and labium are adapted to manipulating the algae the larvae feed on, while the mandibles contain a channel through which fluids are <b>sucked</b> <b>out</b> of the food. The larval legs are short and carry a single claw each, but the forelegs have various adaptations for climbing among water plants. Respiration is via gills which are either long and filamentous, or (in Peltodytes) short microtracheal extensions; they are carried on the tergites of all sternal and all but the tenth (last) abdominal segments. The latter may be absent, but in the larvae of some Haliplidae it is tapering and ends in two prongs (which are not urogomphi though). The last (third) instar has functional spiracles on the mesothorax {{and the first to}} seventh abdominal segments.|$|E

500|$|The scenes {{featuring}} {{shots of}} beetles crawling out of corpses were shot and filmed using real insects {{as well as}} real actors. In particular, during the scene wherein the Complaining Man is discovered dead, over 3,000 live bugs were shot crawling {{on the body of}} Mike Hungerford, the portraying actor. Producer Harry Bring noted that the bug scenes were tedious and hard to film because [...] "bugs don't take directions very well, so you pretty much have to wait until they decided to get it right." [...] Although the shots of the bugs were considerably brief in the final episode, the scenes required a full day of shooting to get perfect. The shots of bugs crawling out of Daniel Brimley's mouth and the shots of the bugs being <b>sucked</b> <b>out</b> of Mulder were created via a combination of CGI and [...] "dummy bugs".|$|E
500|$|... "Dog Eat Dog" [...] is a style {{parody of}} the Talking Heads. Described as a [...] "tongue-in-cheek look at office life", the song was {{inspired}} by Yankovic's past experience of working in the mailrooms {{as well as the}} traffic department at Westwood One radio station. He noted, [...] "At first I thought [...] was kinda cool that I had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own, but after a while I felt like my soul had been <b>sucked</b> <b>out</b> of me." [...] The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song [...] "Once In a Lifetime": [...] "Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful stapler/Sometimes I tell myself this is not my beautiful chair!" [...] This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: [...] "You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful house/You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful wife".|$|E

Willow realizes with increasing uneasiness that she knows neither her lines nor her role. Buffy then takes Willow {{to stand in front of}} a classroom in the same nerdy clothes she wore in [...] "Welcome to the Hellmouth" [...] and [...] "The Harvest" [...] at the beginning of the series.

500|$|The {{script for}} [...] "Twilight" [...] {{was written by}} Mike Sussman, one of the {{co-producers}} on Enterprise. The producers had considered showing the episode {{later on in the}} series in order to show what could have happened if the Xindi were successful in their attack on Earth, but instead elected to show it earlier in the series to demonstrate the stakes in the storyline during season three. [...] "Twilight" [...] was directed by Robert Duncan McNeill, his third directing credit for the series following [...] "" [...] and [...] "". McNeill had previously starred in [...] as Tom Paris. McNeill was interviewed for the magazine Star Trek Monthly shortly after reading the script for [...] "Twilight" [...] for the first time. He explained that after reading it, he said [...] "Holy crap {{how are we going to}} do that?"

500|$|The band {{relocated}} to London in June 1991 when Harvey applied to study sculpture at Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design, still undecided as to her future career.

Independent label Too Pure agreed to release the band's debut single [...] "Dress" [...] in October 1991, and later signed PJ Harvey. [...] "Dress" [...] received mass critical acclaim upon its release and was voted Single of the Week in Melody Maker by guest reviewer John Peel, who admired [...] "the way Polly Jean seems crushed {{by the weight of}} her own songs and arrangements, as if the air is literally being <b>sucked</b> <b>out</b> of them... admirable if not always enjoyable." [...] However, Too Pure provided little promotion for the single and critics claim that [...] "Melody Maker {{had more to do with}} the success of the [...] "Dress" [...] single than Too Pure Records."

Robbins' femur is broken and sticking through the skin, Sloan has serious internal injuries; though initially adrenaline keeps him on his feet. Shepherd is <b>sucked</b> <b>out</b> {{the side of the}} plane and awakens alone in the wood; his mangled hand having been pushed through the door of the plane. However, none are in as bad shape as Lexie, who is crushed under a piece of the plane. While Meredith searches for Shepherd, Yang and Sloan try to move the debris off Lexie. Eventually, the two realize that they cannot save her, so Sloan holds her hand while she dies, telling her that he loves her. As Sloan tells her of the life the two were meant to have together, Lexie dies with {{a smile on her face}} just as Meredith and Yang are approaching.|$|E
500|$|In Willow's dream {{she struggles}} {{to find her}} place in the school theater {{production}} of Death of a Salesman, while her friends and classmates are apparently fully costumed, prepared, and ready to go on stage. Her confusion represents her lack of self-confidence, her fear that she still does not fit in or have a place in the world, unlike those around her, who are competent and know what is going on. She wears ordinary clothes, but the others repeatedly comment on the excellence of her [...] "costume", a reference to her fear that her friends do not see what she has grown into, but rather what she was when younger: nerdy and awkward. This fear is confirmed when Buffy strips off her shirt and jeans, revealing the same unfashionable turtleneck and corduroy jumper she wore in episode one of the series, four years earlier, before her demon-fighting experiences and study of magic increased her confidence and competence. Willow stands anxiously {{at the front of the}} class, trying to read a paper, while her classmates express their boredom with listening to her and Oz whispers into Tara's ear, until she is attacked by the First Slayer and her breath is <b>sucked</b> <b>out</b> of her body.|$|E
500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were <b>sucked</b> <b>out</b> of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told me that I was in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E

[...] Roger Ebert awarded the first part three out of four stars, praising the cast and calling it [...] "a handsome and sometimes harrowing film [...] [...] [...] completely unintelligible for anyone coming to the series for the first time". Scott Bowles of USA Today called it, [...] "Menacing and meditative, Hallows is arguably the best instalment of the planned eight-film franchise, though audiences who haven't kept up with previous chapters will be hopelessly lost", while Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly likewise praised the film as [...] "the most cinematically rewarding chapter yet." [...] In a review for the Orlando Sentinel, Roger Moore proclaimed Part I as [...] "Alternately funny and touching, it's the best film in the series, an Empire Strikes Back for these wizards and their wizarding world.

[...] Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek gave a negative review, writing, [...] "They've taken one of the most enchanting series in contemporary fiction and <b>sucked</b> <b>out</b> all the magic [...] [...] [...] while Rowling's stories are endlessly inventive, Potter onscreen just gives you a headache."
