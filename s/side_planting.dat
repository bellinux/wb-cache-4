40|$|Javelin {{throwing}} {{is a kind}} {{of event}} that has a completely different personality and philosophy from the heave thrower, with almost unrestricted approach run. Approach speed and timing transition of body segment play an important role to performance. Through approach, for the elite world javelin throwers, the speed that the body and javelin obtain is 7 - 8 m/s before exerting finally. Through exerting, the speed of weight of the body is lowered to less than 3 m/s, and javelin obtain 21 m/s above speed. Therefore, through exerting oneself finally, the speed of javelin is increased rapidly, left <b>side</b> <b>planting</b> movement enabling momentum transmit and increase javelin speed. Hence, left leg technique play a important role During transition, the planting of the left leg have a key function, through "whip " technique, the speed of lower big part of the body gradually transmit to upper small arm, via hand, to javelin at last. This study investigated left leg contribution to javelin throwing during the last thrust phase. Eight female javelin throwers were taped during selective competition of X III Asian games in 1998. The subjects were videotaped at 50 frames per second. By analyzing left leg technique, the consciousness of left side supporting and stretching should increased, more and more coaches and athletes will pay more attention to stretching phase of left side supporting technique. The posture of the left foot falling to the ground has influence on left leg supporting technique to certain degree. Home outstanding women javelin throwers should make a little enlargement inside of angle that button up at left foot planting. Home outstanding women javelin throwers have a big buffer degree, hence make the left shoulder, left hip supported not enough. They should enhance the cowgirl muscle the cluster carrying the constringency of left shoulder crest of left shoulder; they should enhance the cowgirl muscle anti-carrying contracting training.

These include S. libanotica, S. triloba, S. lobryana, and S. cypria, which are now considered to be Salvia fruticosa. The variation in leaf depends on geographical area, with plants growing on the western part of Crete having entire leaves with flat blade and margins and dark green upper <b>sides.</b> <b>Plants</b> growing on the eastern side of the island have much smaller leaves, with deeply three-lobed yellowish-green blade and undulate margins.

Regulator hostility towards the addition of generating capacity has made it difficult for utilities to simultaneously satisfy both the needs of their ratepayers and the needs of their shareholders. Recent advances in thermal energy storage may solve the utilities' paradox. Residential thermal energy storage promises to provide the ratepayers significantly lower electricity rates and greater comfort levels. Utilities benefit from improved load factors, peak capacity additions at low cost, improved shareholder value (ie. a better return on assets), improved reliability, and a means of satisfying growing demand without the regulatory and litigious nightmares associated with current supply side solutions.
