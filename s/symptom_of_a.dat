5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100â€“300 AD, cities in the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{has also}} {{addressed}} {{stewardship of the}} natural environment, {{and its relationship to}} other social and theological teachings. In the document Laudato si', dated 24 May 2015, Pope Francis critiques consumerism and irresponsible development, and laments environmental degradation and global warming. The pope expressed concern that the warming of the planet is a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as humans pursue short-term economic gains.|$|E

25|$|Psychosis {{is first}} and {{foremost}} a diagnosis of exclusion. So a new-onset episode of psychosis cannot be considered a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded, or ruled out. Many clinicians improperly perform, or entirely miss this step, introducing avoidable diagnostic error and misdiagnosis.|$|E
25|$|In children, {{the most}} {{prevalent}} <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> CDI is watery diarrhea with at least three bowel movements a day for two or more days, which may be accompanied by fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and/or abdominal pain.

25|$|Federico Fellini {{brought to}} the screen an exuberant imagery shaped by his {{encounter}} {{with the ideas of}} Jung, especially Jungian dream interpretation. Fellini preferred Jung to Freud because Jungian analysis defined the dream not as a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disease that required a cure but rather as a link to archetypal images shared by all of humanity.|$|E

25|$|In {{boys and}} men, {{abnormal}} breast development is manifested as gynecomastia, {{the consequence of}} a biochemical imbalance between the normal levels of estrogen and testosterone in the male body. Around 70% of boys temporarily develop breast tissue during adolescence. The condition usually resolves by itself within two years. When male lactation occurs, it is considered a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disorder of the pituitary gland.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{myoclonus}} {{occurs during}} the initial phases of sleep, especially {{at the moment of}} dropping off to sleep. Some forms appear to be stimulus-sensitive. Some people with sleep myoclonus are rarely troubled by it, or need treatment. If it is a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more complex and disturbing sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome, it may require medical treatment. Myoclonus can be associated with patients with Tourette syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Jeffrey Victor {{says that}} in the United States the groups most likely to believe rumors of SRA are rural, poorly educated religiously {{conservative}} Protestant blue-collar families with an unquestioning belief in American values who feel significant anxieties over job loss, economic decline and family disintegration.

25|$|Once {{the facial}} {{paralysis}} sets in, many people may mistake it as a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stroke; however, {{there are a}} few subtle differences. A stroke will usually cause a few additional symptoms, such as numbness or weakness in the arms and legs. And unlike Bell's palsy, a stroke will usually let patients control the upper part of their faces. A person with a stroke will usually have some wrinkling of their forehead.|$|E
25|$|Miscarriage, {{also known}} as {{spontaneous}} abortion and pregnancy loss, is the natural death of an embryo or fetus before {{it is able to}} survive independently. Some use the cutoff of 20 weeks of gestation, after which fetal death is known as a stillbirth. The most common <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> miscarriage is vaginal bleeding with or without pain. Sadness, anxiety and guilt often occur afterwards. Tissue and clot-like material may also come out of the vagina. When a woman keeps having miscarriages, infertility is present.|$|E
25|$|Fatigue is {{generally}} considered a more long-term condition than sleepiness (somnolence). Although sleepiness can be a symptom of medical issues, it usually results from lack of restful sleep, {{or a lack of}} stimulation. Chronic fatigue, on the other hand, is a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> greater medical problem in most cases. It manifests in mental or physical weariness and inability to complete tasks at normal performance. Both are often used interchangeably and even categorized under the description of 'being tired.' Oftentimes fatigue is described as an uncomfortable tiredness, whereas sleepiness is comfortable and inviting.|$|E

25|$|Psychosis {{as a sign}} of a {{psychiatric}} disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion. That is, a new-onset episode of psychosis is not considered a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded. Medical and biological laboratory tests should exclude central nervous system diseases and injuries, diseases and injuries of other organs, psychoactive substances, and toxins as causes of symptoms of psychosis before any psychiatric illness can be diagnosed. In medical training, psychosis {{as a sign of}} illness is often compared to fever since both can have multiple causes that are not readily apparent.|$|E
25|$|The key <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> glacier in disequilibrium is {{thinning}} {{along the}} entire length of the glacier. For example, Easton Glacier (pictured below) will likely shrink to half its size, but at a slowing rate of reduction, and stabilize at that size, despite the warmer temperature, over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier (pictured below) will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with shallow slopes such as Grinnell Glacier are most likely to fall into disequilibrium if there is a change in the local climate.|$|E
25|$|Frequent {{urination}} can be due {{to excessive}} urine production, small bladder capacity, irritability or incomplete emptying. Males with an enlarged prostate urinate more frequently. One definition of an overactive bladder is when a person urinates more than eight times per day. An overactive bladder can often cause urinary incontinence. Though both urinary frequency and volumes {{have been shown to}} have a circadian rhythm, meaning day and night cycles, it is not entirely clear how these are disturbed in the overactive bladder. Urodynamic testing can help to explain the symptoms. An underactive bladder is the condition where there is a difficulty in passing urine and is the main <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> neurogenic bladder. Frequent urination at night may indicate the presence of bladder stones.|$|E
