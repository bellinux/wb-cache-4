5000|$|One {{widely used}} circuit is the {{reflection}} amplifier {{in which the}} separation is accomplished by a circulator. A circulator is a nonreciprocal <b>solid-state</b> <b>component</b> with three ports (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode N is attached through a filter F to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing [...] "reflected" [...] amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance [...] of the input and output transmission lines, usually 50Î©, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter F is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.|$|E
30|$|Astronomical spectroscopic {{observations}} have unequivocally {{detected the}} presence of inorganic minerals such as amorphous silicates in circumstellar, interstellar, and galactic environments. These oxygen-based solids no doubt {{play an important role}} in the chemical makeup of the <b>solid-state</b> <b>component</b> of our own and other galaxies. We propose that carbon-based grains are equally, if not more prevalent, in the Universe. Recent astronomical and Solar System observations have shown that complex organic matter is widely present in the planetary, stellar, interstellar, and galactic environments. We now have evidence that organics of aromatic and aliphatic structures are being made efficiently and on a large scale by stars. These organic stellar materials are ejected into the interstellar medium, and may have reached the early Solar System. Bombardment by comets and asteroids during the early age of the Earth might have brought some of these primordial organics to Earth (Kwok, 2009).|$|E
