40|$|The article {{presents}} a development of financial {{relations of the}} socialist states in the years of 1945 — 1963 and 1964 — 1982. Conditioning of the first period, forming and developing bilateral financial relations, {{is presented in the}} aspect of strong trends of protection of newly constructed industry, limited supply of export goods and inelastic demand on certain products. Circumstances of the second period which gave rise to technical and settling conditions for <b>multilateral</b> <b>settlements</b> are discussed in the latter part, they were not able to relieve a trade system of the socialist countries from the bilateral balancing. Discussing a complex problem of efficiency of <b>multilateral</b> <b>settlements,</b> the author quotes opinions of international finances' specialists and researchers and seeks for new substantial and technical solutions in order to arrive to an agreement between principles of state controlled economy and demands of international trade in the aspect of settlements. In the author's opinion, models of cash settlements between the socialist countries are unsatisfactory at their present stage. The author advocates that requirements of life have to be followed: the conditions of foreign trade are varying, world's economy is not static, supply of goods and services and demand are constantly fluctuating as well as world prices. It is therefore necessary to introduce a reasonable multilaterality of settlements making for stimulation of currency and increase of weight of finances in international settlements and in consequence- for multilateral balancing of trade turnover. In view of the tendencies to isolate socialist countries in the foreign trade, the author emphasises the need to concentrate efforts to create better currency system which would, under the influence of developing CMEA cooperation, improve <b>multilateral</b> <b>settlements.</b> Although payments turnover is functioning efficiently in the CMEA countries by means of the transfer ruble, the article indicates that major problems in the trade between socialist countries are caused by the fact that each socialist state, in order to balance its foreign trade according to plan, establishes quotas, attempts at bilateral balancing of a foreign trade and links directly a volume of exports and imports of deliveries under contract. Bilaterality understood in that way diminishes utility of transfer ruble and its flexibility in settlements and results in ruble's failure to perform its functions in the international trade. In the following remarks the author discusses the role of transfer ruble in settlements in socialist states as a product of the currency system of these states and of the principle of inconvertibility of national currencies, he is also trying to determine whether transfer ruble is a contractual unit of settlement predominated by elements of bilateralism or it is a type of international currency. The author adopts a notion of transfer ruble as an international currency, in its narrow meaning, i. e. which is recognized solely by those states which had created it, as their common unit of account. The article attributes functions of money sui generis to transfer ruble: a scope in which the ruble can perform classical functions of money is described, as a standard of value, as a tender, as a means of accumulation of value. Various views of scientists and financial experts are quoted in this respect. In conclusion, the author admits that transfer ruble is not an international currency in the wide meaning of this word and should be classed among extramonetary units of settlement. Present forms of trade between socialist countries should be, in the authors opinion, altered to overcome a "product for product" barrier, to extend the trade turnover and to create a possibility of converting a value expressed in one currency into another currency. This requires the existence of real exchange rates and a national currency should act as a tender not only in the country but also abroad. Estimating real financial relations of trade and settlements, the author speaks for improving the existing collective currency and elaborating a program in future aiming at introducing convertible currency of the CMEA states or, at least, a currency of partially limited convertibility.

This article first analyses the WTO panel reports and clarifies that the panel never rejected the objectives of Section 609, but only criticized its unilateral, in flexible application.

40|$|Restricted until 29 Sep. 2012. This thesis {{examines}} {{the variations in}} both the level of patent protection and changes therein across countries and over time. The main finding is that both domestic economic, political and legal characteristics as well as bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> dispute <b>settlement</b> mechanisms are important in raising countries’ patent rights protection in the past decades.; More specifically, my studies confirm that domestic economic development, associated with R&D investment, {{is the main reason}} for countries to improve their patent protection, with human capital, political freedom and trade openness as contributing factors. Furthermore, Common Law countries and German Civil Law countries tend to provide higher protection for patent rights than French Civil Law countries, although its effect on patent protection might not be direct but probably only indirect through its effect on R&D and trade openness. Last but not least, bilateral dispute settlement mechanisms, represented by the U. S. ’s Special 301 placements and Section 306 monitoring, have significantly and consistently positive effects on propelling target countries to provide higher legislative protection for patents, just as bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with the U. S. do. Designating a country as “Priority Foreign County”, which is the most severe but seldom used instrument of “unilateral aggressiveness”, did not by itself contribute to the improvement of patent protection according to the results. It does, however, work with other bilateral coercive means. The strengthened WTO dispute settlement mechanism only plays a marginal effect on countries’ patent protection over time. The bilateral dispute settlement mechanisms represented by the U. S. Trade Representative’s Special 301 placements and other monitoring procedures and bilateral incentives resulting from the BITs between the U. S. and other countries overwhelmed domestic economic, political and legal characteristics in explaining the improvement of patent protection over time.

40|$|The {{current debate}} on trade {{liberalization}} {{is accompanied by}} an increased concern about environmental and food safety issues leading to frictions of different country groups under the World Trade Organization (WTO). This discussion paper aims at shedding more light {{on some of the}} issues in the "trade and environment" debate. It describes the complex process of setting standards, the relevant WTO agreements dealing with technical as well as sanitary and phytosanitary standards and potential outcomes of setting environmental standards-outcomes for the environment, for international trade relations and the competitiveness of countries. The theoretical part shows that under certain assumptions, not only protectionist but also environmental concerns may lead to a political decision for suboptimal standards. Finally, the paper offers a list of alternative policy responses and strategies to tackle environmental issues in the context of international trade. This includes the polluter-pays principle, eco-labeling and other labeling schemes, reducing in- and output subsidies, stronger enforcement of given standards, technical assistance, harmonization and mutual recognition of equivalent <b>standards,</b> and <b>multilateral</b> environmental agreements (MEAs).

However, various theoretical, methodological and empirical issues remain insufficiently addressed. This article will address two issues that have mostly been neglected: {{the perspective of the}} norm takers (in line with this special issue) and the market norms of the EU. The first section elaborates on these two issues, relying on recent advances in the literature and specifically the contributions by Damro (J Eur Publ Pol 19 (5) : 682 – 699, 2012) and Rosamond (Brit J Polit Int Relat 16 (1) : 133 – 148, 2013).

This practice leads actors to reconsider their positions on transparency {{as set out in}} international investment agreements (IIAs), annexes to arbitral rules or memoranda of state. Under pressure to keep further arbitration proceedings open to the public, some actors are now eager to create a new <b>multilateral</b> <b>standard</b> of transparency.

Our analysis of recent WTO proposals suggests that a WTO agreement is unlikely to impose significant adjustment pressures on the US sugar market beyond those created by NAFTA. The adoption of a standard program {{would make it easier for}} the US to meet its commitments under a new WTO agreement in terms of reductions in trade-distorting amber-box support. Moving to a standard program would increase the costs of the program for taxpayers but would lower costs for sugar users.
