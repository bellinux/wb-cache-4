2500|$|HVDC {{converters}} {{can take}} several different forms. Early HVDC systems, built until the 1930s, were effectively rotary converters and used electromechanical conversion with motor-generator sets connected in {{series on the}} DC side and in parallel on the AC side. [...] However, all HVDC systems built since the 1940s have used electronic (<b>static)</b> <b>converters.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>static</b> <b>converters</b> in {{the system}} were {{commissioned}} during the decade between 1992 and around 2002. <b>Static</b> <b>converters</b> use high-power solid-state electronics, with few moving parts. Chief advantages of <b>static</b> <b>converters</b> over motor generators include lower capital cost, lower operating costs, and higher conversion efficiency. The Jericho Park converter exceeds its efficiency design criteria of 95%. Major disadvantages of solid state converters include harmonic frequency generation on both the 25 Hz and 60 Hz sides, and lower overload capability.|$|E

50|$|These {{may be an}} {{alternative}} where {{the issue at hand}} is starting a motor, rather than polyphase power itself. The <b>static</b> phase <b>converter</b> is used to start a three-phase motor. The motor then runs on a single phase with a synthesised third pole. However, this makes the power balance, and thus motor efficiency, extremely poor, requiring de-rating the motor (typically to 60% or less). Overheating, and quite often destruction of the motor, will result from failing to do so. (Many manufacturers and dealers specifically state that using a <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> will void any warranty.) An oversized <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> can remove the need to de-rate the motor, but at an increased cost.|$|R

5000|$|Jericho Park, MD - 20 MW <b>Static</b> <b>Converter.</b> Jericho Park was {{constructed}} {{to replace the}} capacity lost when BG&E declined to renew the Benning rotary converter contract. BG&E proposed a <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> to replace Benning and Jericho Park came on service six years later. It consists of two 10 MW cycloconverter modules supplied by GE. Jericho Park was the first solid-state power supply introduced on the Amtrak network. It suffered from some filtering network problems caused by the highly distorted voltage present on the catenary and was ultimately downgraded from its original design capacity of 25 MW to 22 MVA. Amtrak has requested funding to rehabilitate portions of the converter in an ARRA request. During the twelve-month period that ended in August 2009, the Jericho Park converter used about 70 GWh of energy. Note that SEPTA's <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> plant at Wayne Junction is also based on this technology, although it was supplied by a different company; see SEPTA's 25 Hz Traction Power System.|$|R

40|$|The probrem {{in regard}} to driving of a {{monocyclic}} motor is how to choose a <b>static</b> phase <b>converter</b> allowing a satisfactory starting，acceleration and load characteristics. For an ideal operation，the <b>static</b> phase <b>converter</b> should be continuously varied with the velocity of the motor, but in practice it is common that {{the choice of the}} <b>static</b> phase <b>converter</b> is to be done when it is started, accelerated and it is being driven at the rated speed. Upon this，the author tried his analysis by means of symmetrical component theory，as shown in Fig. 1, on troque, unbalance factors and the phase current at the time of starting. The results thus obtained，being represented as functions of four parameters without any dimension，could be applied to given rated motors. Therefore the comparison of starting with various kinds of <b>static</b> phase <b>converter</b> became very simple and easy to be done. Among three kinds of combinations of L, C, and R as elements of <b>static</b> phase <b>converter,</b> the combination where L and C were used was revealed to be most excellent, while a completely balanced state was observed when the impedance angle of the motor was 30 °, y= 1 and k= 2. ...|$|R
