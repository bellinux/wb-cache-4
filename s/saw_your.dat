Sam suggests to Mercedes {{that they get}} back together, but she reminds Sam she is dating Shane (LaMarcus Tinker).

Later, while Mercedes sings [...] "The First Time Ever I <b>Saw</b> <b>Your</b> Face" [...] with Rachel (Lea Michele), Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Santana (Naya Rivera) for Will as their proposal suggestion, she mentally pictures Sam rather than Shane, and is distressed.|$|E

500|$|Director Mark Romanek {{has said}} that, {{as in the}} novel, {{everyone}} has to uncover their relationship to our own mortality; we have two options: either go against it, or {{try to figure out}} a way around it like the character Tommy does. Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>your</b> film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn’t spoken to him in 3 weeks and I told him how much I love him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been." ...|$|E
500|$|The first single, [...] "That's the Way It Is" [...] is {{an optimistic}} uptempo song, co-written and co-produced by Max Martin, {{best known for}} his work with young pop artists. Other {{highlights}} on All the Way... A Decade of Song include a remake of Roberta Flack's [...] "The First Time Ever I <b>Saw</b> <b>Your</b> Face", which Dion has performed acoustically in her Let's Talk About Love World Tour; the Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange ballad [...] "If Walls Could Talk", with Shania Twain on background vocals; the power ballad [...] "I Want You to Need Me" [...] from Diane Warren; another, orchestrated power ballad [...] "Then You Look at Me;" [...] and a song Dion and René Angélil got married to, [...] "All the Way", here in a virtual duet with Frank Sinatra.|$|E
500|$|Lewis {{performed}} a nineteen-song set list with a four-piece band and two backup vocalists. Her vocals, stage presence and {{interaction with the}} crowds was lauded by the critics in attendance. Many singled out her performance of [...] "Ave Maria" [...] as the set's highlight, while others also praised renditions of [...] "The First Time Ever I <b>Saw</b> <b>Your</b> Face", [...] "A Moment Like This" [...] and [...] "Run". Several noted that {{nearly a third of}} the set list consisted of both official covers recorded by Lewis previously included on her albums, as well as cover songs intended just for the tour. Some were complimentary of the unofficial covers, most notably Lewis' version of [...] "Time After Time" [...] by Cyndi Lauper, whereas others felt that there were too many and that they were too forgettable.|$|E

500|$|After winning The X Factor in December 2006 {{and signing}} a [...] {{contract}} with Simon Cowell's record label Syco and Clive Davis's J Records, Lewis {{began to work}} with writers Ryan Tedder and Steve Mac, among others, for her debut studio album Spirit, which was released in November 2007. The first single, [...] "A Moment Like This", was released the day after Lewis won The X Factor, and its second single, [...] "Bleeding Love", was released in October 2007. Lewis also covered Roberta Flack's [...] "The First Time Ever I <b>Saw</b> <b>Your</b> Face" [...] for the album. Cowell conceptualised the song [...] "Footprints in the Sand", and was thus credited as a songwriter. Lewis also co-wrote the song [...] "Here I Am" [...] with Walter Afanasieff. The re-release of Spirit in November 2008 {{was followed by a}} cover of Snow Patrol's [...] "Run".|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Sony Music Entertainment {{released}} All the Way... A Decade of Song & Video on DVD. It includes {{music videos}} for [...] "If Walls Could Talk" [...] and [...] "Then You Look at Me", which weren't released as singles. It also contains two videos from the 1999 CBS television special, [...] "All the Way" [...] and [...] "The First Time Ever I <b>Saw</b> <b>Your</b> Face", and music videos for All the Way... A Decade of Song singles: [...] "That's the Way It Is", [...] "Live (for the One I Love)" [...] and [...] "I Want You to Need Me" [...]The DVD also includes previous hits, {{some of them}} in live versions from the Live in Memphis concert. In late 2003, Sony Music Entertainment released a combination of All the Way... A Decade of Song CD and All the Way... A Decade of Song & Video DVD in Europe and Australia.|$|E
500|$|All the Way... A Decade of Song {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Michael Paoletta from Billboard {{gave it a}} very positive review, calling the album a reminder of why the decade has been Dion's signature era – and why the future looks bright for her. According to him, regarding seven new songs, All the Way... A Decade of Song is Dion's most focused album yet, drawing on a team of collaborators that understands this artists's strengths. Among the highlights Paoletta mentioned: the first single [...] "That's the Way It Is", a welcome uptempo number; [...] "I Want You to Need Me", a consummate love song ripe for a second single; [...] "If Walls Could Talk;" [...] "Then You Look at Me", a characteristically [...] "roof-raising, fan-stoking" [...] Dion anthem; her [...] "beyond-the-pale" [...] duet with Frank Sinatra on [...] "All the Way"; and [...] "The First Time Ever I <b>Saw</b> <b>Your</b> Face", a remake that [...] "affirms Dion's ability to lay low and still scintillate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hallo! Ting-a-ling," [...] {{cried the}} other. [...] "Is that you? Come with me, and I {{will show you}} the funniest thing you ever <b>saw</b> in <b>your</b> life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You seem to {{have found}} it necessary,' I said, 'to change a great many things since I last <b>saw</b> you? <b>Your</b> name, your residence, your {{personal}} appearance--?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For some guest who admired Miss Beaufort. I did {{not hear}} his name, nor observe him enough to {{discover}} who he was. I <b>saw</b> only <b>your</b> land mother, your charming little sister, and--" ...|$|R
500|$|Another {{characteristic}} feature was {{his ability}} to hold a chord in the lower strings while bending an upper string—often bending up from a semitone below a chord note. These can be heard clearly on songs such as [...] "Reynardine" [...] where the bends are from the diminished fifth to the perfect fifth. Jansch often fitted the accompaniment to the natural rhythm of the words of his songs, rather than playing a consistent rhythm throughout. This can lead to occasional bars appearing in unusual time signatures. For example, {{his version of the}} Ewan MacColl song [...] "The First Time Ever I <b>Saw</b> <b>Your</b> Face", unlike most other covers of that song, switches from 4/4 time to 3/4 and 5/4. A similar disregard for conventional time signatures is found in several of his collaborative compositions with Pentangle: for instance, [...] "Light Flight" [...] from the Basket of Light album includes sections in 5/8, 7/8 and 6/4 time.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of Lewis' {{performance}} at the London Palladium on 5 March, William J Connolly of Gay Times praised the singer's openness regarding her personal and private life throughout the show, which gave the audience an insight as to [...] "why she's remained quiet in previous months and why, as we all love, each album is full of emotion and honesty". He singled out [...] "The First Time Ever I <b>Saw</b> <b>Your</b> Face", [...] "Bleeding Love", and [...] "Thunder" [...] as the show's highlights, and described [...] "Run" [...] as [...] "perfect". Emma Noye of the Ipswich Star wrote that despite there being some Americanisms in the show, such as [...] "horse-riding, beach-walking backing visuals with a voiceover talking about the 'journey' she's been on", Lewis' voice was [...] "indisputably fantastic". Noye went on to write that the singer [...] "made everyone feel included and engaged" [...] and praised her performance of [...] "Ave Maria" [...] as [...] "stunning".|$|E
500|$|On 7 October 1999, Celine Dion taped {{her second}} CBS {{television}} special at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City. She performed: [...] "Love Can Move Mountains", [...] "To Love You More" [...] (with Taro Hakase on violin), [...] "That's the Way It Is" [...] (with 'N Sync), [...] "All the Way" [...] (virtual duet with Frank Sinatra), [...] "The First Time Ever I <b>Saw</b> <b>Your</b> Face" [...] and {{a medley of}} [...] "Here We Are/Because You Loved Me/Conga" [...] in duet with Gloria Estefan. The television special aired on 22 November 1999 and was the second-most-watched program in its time slot, with an 8.3 rating and a 14 share. Dion also performed [...] "That's the Way It Is" [...] in various television and award shows in late 1999, before taking a two-year break from the music industry. On 31 December 1999, she performed her last concert at Montral's Molson Center, with guest Bryan Adams {{and a host of}} French-Canadian singers.|$|E

500|$|Adrian Caffery of the Birmingham Mail gave a mixed {{review of}} the show at the city's Symphony Hall. While he was {{complimentary}} of Lewis' vocals performances {{on most of the}} original tracks, most notably on [...] "Ave Maria", which he described as demonstrating [...] "an amazing transformation to opera diva", he was critical of Lewis' decision to include seven cover songs on the set list. Although Caffery wrote that [...] "Run", [...] "The First Time Ever I <b>Saw</b> <b>Your</b> Face", [...] "Ave Maria", and [...] "A Moment Like This" [...] – the last of which he described as [...] "cheesy" [...] – were to be expected, as Lewis had recorded them for previous albums. However, he disapproved of [...] "Time After Time", labelling it [...] "ok", and called the Sam Smith covers [...] "instantly forgettable". He concluded by writing: [...] "There was enough evidence to suggest Leona is capable of staging an utterly mesmerising show from start to finish – just not this time". A critic from The Bristol Post wrote that Lewis [...] "dazzled" [...] the audience who [...] " [...] Leona's impressive vocals and stunning songs", placing emphasis on her rendition of [...] "Time After Time".|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for the Express & Star, Elizabeth Joyce said {{although}} Lewis {{was not like}} her contemporaries: [...] "meat dress-wearing" [...] Lady Gaga or the Russell Brand-marrying Katy Perry, [...] "no one can reach those soft lows or soaring highs quite like her". Joyce praised the concert for showing the best of Lewis' vocal abilities. Focussing predominately on songs from Spirit (2007) and Glassheart (2012), the concert was largely acoustic music with a band and string quartet. In particular Joyce praised Lewis' performances of [...] "First Time Ever I <b>Saw</b> <b>Your</b> Face" [...] and [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] which earned her standing ovations, {{in addition to the}} [...] "note perfect" [...] rendition of [...] "Run". Katherine Hollisey-McLean for the Worthing Herald largely agreed, commenting that if anyone expected Lewis to be [...] "belting out song after song" [...] they were right. Hollisey-McLean praised the decisions to switch the song arrangements, for example adding reggae beats to [...] "Better in Time" [...] and performing the acoustic version of [...] "Trouble". She ended by saying that Lewis' vocals were [...] "flawless" [...] and that her stage presence and confidence had vastly improved over the last seven years.|$|E
500|$|On October 1, 2012, it was {{announced}} that MacFarlane would host the 85th Academy Awards on February 24, 2013. He also presented the nominees with actress Emma Stone, on January 10, 2013. In addition to hosting, MacFarlane was also nominated in the Academy Award for Best Original Song category for co-writing the theme song [...] "Everybody Needs a Best Friend" [...] for his film Ted with Walter Murphy. Critical response to MacFarlane's performance was mixed. Columnist Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly commented [...] "By calling constant attention to the naughty factor," [...] MacFarlane created [...] "an echo chamber of outrage, working a little too hard to top himself with faux-scandalous gags about race, Jews in Hollywood, and the killing of Abraham Lincoln." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter praised MacFarlane's performance saying that he did [...] "impressively better than one would have wagered." [...] He also noted that he added [...] "plenty of niceties {{with a little bit of}} the Ricky Gervais bite-the-hand-that-feeds-you thing and worked the juxtaposition rather nicely." [...] He stirred up controversy in the form of a musical number titled [...] "We <b>Saw</b> <b>Your</b> Boobs".|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure of that," [...] he {{answered}} hopefully. [...] "When I <b>saw</b> that <b>your</b> father knew of it to-day, I {{asked him to}} let me see you again. I'm afraid that I broke my promise to you--technically----" ...|$|R
