Seat are usually screwed in or torqued [...] This pushes the cage {{down on the}} lip of the seat and holds it firmly to the body of the valve. Seat may also be threaded and screwed into a thread cut in the same area of the body. However this method makes removal of the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> during maintenance difficult if not impossible. Seat rings are also typically beveled at the seating surface to allow for some guiding during the final stages of closing the valve.|$|E
40|$|A {{control valve}} that can {{throttle}} high-pressure cryogenic fluid embodies several design features that distinguish it over conventional valves designed for similar applications. Field and design engineers {{worked together to}} create a valve that would simplify installation, trim changes, and maintenance, thus reducing overall cost. The seals and plug stem packing were designed to perform optimally in cryogenic temperature ranges. Unlike conventional high-pressure cryogenic valves, the trim size can be changed independent of the body. The design feature that provides flexibility for changing the trim is a split body. The body is divided into an upper and a lower section with the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> sandwiched in between. In order to maintain the plug stem packing at an acceptable sealing temperature during cryogenic service, heat-exchanging fins were added to the upper body section. The body is made of stainless steel. The <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> is made of a nickel-based alloy having a coefficient of thermal expansion less than that of the body material. Consequently, when the interior of the valve is cooled cryogenically, the body surrounding the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> contracts more than the <b>seat</b> <b>ring.</b> This feature prevents external leakage at the body-seat joint. The <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> has been machined to have small, raised-face sealing surfaces {{on both sides of the}} seal groove. These sealing surfaces concentrate the body bolt load over a small area, thereby preventing external leakage. The design of the body bolt circle is different from that of conventional highpressure control valves. Half of the bolts clamp the split body together from the top, and half from the bottom side. This bolt-circle design allows a short, clean flow path, which minimizes frictional flow losses. This bolt-circle design also makes it possible to shorten the face-toface length of the valve, which is 25. 5 in. (65 cm). In contrast, a conventional, high-pressure control valve face-to-face dimension may be greater than 40 in. (> 1 m) long...|$|E
40|$|Intake and {{exhaust valves}} {{operating}} in diesel engines for naval propulsion suffer from several problems {{due to the}} combined and synergistic effects of mechanical stresses and a chemically harsh environment. Degradation mechanisms like wear and corrosion act on different sections of the valve, {{with the result that}} each part undergoes a different kind of damage. The present work particularly focuses on degradation phenomena such as low temperature corrosion and erosive wear on the stem; hot corrosion {{on the bottom of the}} head of the valve; wear on the <b>seat</b> <b>ring.</b> In order to prevent the valves from degrading, a possible solution is the application of protective coatings that may extend the service life of the components by preserving the mechanical properties of substrate materials, while improving the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the surface. The objective of this study is the development, testing and optimization of a system of corrosion and wear resistant coatings for the stem, bottom and <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> of the valves. The analysis of the degradation mechanisms occurring on each section of the valves led to the selection of materials that could be suitable for the protection of the substrate. Specifically, two different kinds of ceramic-metallic coatings were selected for the protection of the stem and the bottom of the valves, while a modification of the state-of-the art coating applied on the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> was performed...|$|E

40|$|Pelton turbine is {{an engine}} that {{facilitates}} continuous {{power as a}} wheel or a rotor continually turns due to the pressure of fast moving water through the bucket, where a bucket receives water from the surging nozzle. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the highest efficiency among different types of Pelton turbine through the modification of bucket volume, bucket angle attack, nozzle needle <b>seat</b> <b>ring,</b> and nozzle needle seat tip. The experiment was conducted at Energy Conversion Laboratory of Sebelas Maret University. The comparative study among the different parameters shows that the value of maximum efficiency was 21. 65 %, which was obtained at 90 ° needle <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> and 45 ° needle seat tip, and + 15 % bucket size and 92 ° angle of attack. It was gained likely due to the lightness of the + 15 % bucket compared to the standard bucket and the collision produced by the jet water {{in the middle of the}} bucket, in which the water loading occupied the large area on the surface of the bucket and promoted the increasing speed. It is expected that the result on the appropriate size and angle attack of bucket at specific nozzle <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> and seat tip of this experiment can be manufactured commercially in the future for achieving maximum Pelton turbine efficiency...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Lapping {{process is}} {{characterized}} by its low speed, low pressure, and low material removal rate. This process is used in achieving finer surfaces and closer fits, correction of minor imperfections, and maintaining close tolerances. During the process of lapping, the mechanisms of surface formation and removal rate are decisively influenced by the movement type of the individual grains within the lapping abrasive. A gate valve is used to start and {{stop the flow of}} fluid. So the wedge and <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> of a valve are in continuous pressure of fluid flow and due to opening and closing of valve these component get wear and they need lapping during reconditioning. This paper will share the need, requirement and application of lapping during the reconditioning of valve. This paper will explore the current working condition of lapping machine in valve industry. It will elaborate the effect of abrasive particals, working speed, surface roughness and other related parameters. What are the difficulties they are facing during the valve reconditioning related to lapping, will be disscussed. Current set up and the changes required in this model are suggested with the proposed model. Key words: Lapping process, wedge, <b>seat</b> <b>ring,</b> abrasive particles. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently a {{fuel oil}} of the diesel engine in the {{merchant}} ship {{has been changed}} with heavy oil of low quality as the oil price is getting higher and higher. Therefore, the wear and corrosion against {{all parts of the}} engine are significantly increased with using of heavy oil of low quality. In particular, the degree of wear and corrosion in between spindle and <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> of exhaust valve are more serious compared to the other parts of the engine due to severe environment such as the high temperature of exhaust gas and repeating impact. Thus, repair welding is a unique method to prolong their lifetime in an economical point of view. In this study, an effect of welding methods to corrosion and mechanical properties of both weld and base metal zone was investigated with some electrochemical methods such as measurement of corrosion potential, cathodic and anodic polarization curves, cyclic voltammogram and AC impedance etc. in. The hardness of the weld metal zones exhibited comparatively higher values than that of the base metal zone. And their corrosion resistances were also increased compared to the base metal. The weld metal zone of P 1 F (plasma welding with 1 pass) showed a relatively good corrosion resistance as well as the hardness compared to the other welding methods. Consequently, it is considered that plasma welding method is a desirable method compared to other welding methods for both better corrosion and hardness properties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Recently, {{the fuel}} oil of diesel engine of marine ships {{has been changed}} with heavy oil of low quality as the oil price is getting higher and higher. Therefore, the wear and {{corrosion}} against {{all parts of the}} engine, such as cylinder liner, piston crown, and spindle and <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> of exhaust valves has predominantly increased due to its consumption. Thus, the repair welding of the piston crown is a unique method to prolong its life in a economical point of view. In this case, filler metals having a better corrosion and wear resistance are mainly being used for repair welding. However, the piston crown on the ship s job site is often actually being welded with mild filler metals. Therefore, in this study, the mild filler metals, such as E 5016, E 1216, and E 2316, were welded to the SS 401 steel as the base metal, and the corrosion properties of their weld metal zones with and without post weld heat treatment were investigated with some electrochemical methods in 0. 1 % H 2 SO 4 solution. The weld metal zone welded with E 1216 filler metal exhibited the best corrosion resistance among the filler metals with irrespective of heat treatment, however, its corrosion resistance was somewhat decreased due to the post weld heat treatment(annealing: 625 o C, 2 hr). In particular, the weld metal of E 2316 exhibited relatively a good corrosion resistances by the post weld heat treatment...|$|E

It was mounted in twin-gun turrets which had a couple of unusual features. First, most of the turret's operating machinery was housed inside the turret, with only an armored tube to protect the ammunition hoists.
