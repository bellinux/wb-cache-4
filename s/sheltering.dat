40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the types of}} ground-level <b>shelters,</b> their availability and use by mammals and birds at Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho (PECB), an Atlantic forest area at southeastern Brazil. Eight types of <b>shelters</b> were found: <b>shelters</b> without tunnels under living trees, <b>shelters</b> with tunnels under living trees, <b>shelters</b> under mounds formed by adventitious roots, <b>shelters</b> under fallen trees, burrows not supported by trees or roots, riverbank <b>shelters,</b> stream tunnels and rock <b>shelters.</b> Mammal species that used <b>shelters</b> more frequently were Agouti paca, Philander frenata, Lontra longicaudis, Metachirus nudicaudatus and Trinomys iheringi. Utilization of <b>shelter</b> types and <b>shelter</b> topographic locations by these six species was roughly similar to the proportions in which <b>shelters</b> of different types and locations were monitored, {{with the exception of}} otters, which are semi-aquatic mammals and used mainly riverbank <b>shelters.</b> Contrary to expectations, animals did not choose <b>shelters</b> with entrances fitted to their sizes. <b>Shelters</b> were used either by a single species or by different species. I hypothesize that at the PECB other factors such as microclimate inside <b>shelters</b> must be more important in determining <b>shelter</b> use than <b>shelter</b> external characteristics or topographic location. Some species, as coatis Nasua nasua and probably small didelphids and birds, enter <b>shelters</b> to search for invertebrates and small vertebrates...|$|R

40|$|TITLE: The Psychological Aspects of the Life in a <b>Shelter</b> AUTHOR: PhDr. Roman Čepelák DEPARTMENT: Katedra {{psychologie}} SUPERVISOR: Doc. PhDr. Miloš Kučera, CSc. ABSTRACT: The master thesis explores, by analytic way, {{the life}} of clients in <b>shelter</b> for families with children. The thesis describes the specific <b>shelter</b> home in Prague - Horní Pocernice and observes its specifics {{in a context of}} other <b>shelters.</b> It maps the target group of users, who are mostly clients from Roma population. The thesis aims at clients' motives to live in a <b>shelter,</b> their coping with <b>shelter</b> norms and their adjustment of <b>shelter</b> rules to clients' own needs. It notices individual behaviors in a community of clients, describing interactions with social workers and between each other. The specific chapter is devoted to children as the youngest users of a <b>shelter,</b> their coping with the environment and the possibilities <b>shelter</b> home offers to them. The last chapter implies a certain similarity in <b>shelter</b> clients thinking with thinking of people living in an oral culture. The thesis disputes declared purpose of <b>shelter</b> home(s) as training of their own home living, since their repetitive "coming home" returns to <b>shelter(s)</b> witness another motives for <b>shelter</b> life as well.

This behavior, though frequently observed in hatchlings and juveniles, has never been studied in cuttlefish. Here, we shall address the importance of embryonic visual experience on the choice of <b>shelters</b> in hatchlings. For this, we incubated eggs in three different visual environments: (i) with white <b>shelters,</b> (ii) with black <b>shelters,</b> (iii) without <b>shelters.</b> After hatching, the cuttlefish were individually placed in a tank containing both black and white <b>shelters.</b> Both naive cuttlefish and those exposed to black <b>shelters</b> prior to hatching preferred hiding under the black <b>shelters.</b> The cuttlefish exposed to white <b>shelters</b> prior to hatching did not show any preference in <b>shelter</b> color.

5|$|Although the British {{ships were}} {{substantially}} larger than any individual French vessel, the frigates were more numerous and more manoeuvrable. Neither side {{could afford to}} take significant damage in the battle, so each sought to drive the other off rather than achieve an outright victory. On 9 September Sercey's frigates formed a line of battle, successfully engaging first Arrogant and then Victorious and inflicting damage on each while preventing them from supporting one another. The French frigates, particularly Vertu and Seine, also suffered and by late morning both sides disengaged, the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago, eventually <b>sheltering</b> in Batavia.|$|E
