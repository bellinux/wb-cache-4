2500|$|Because {{of their}} {{identical}} names, {{there has been}} some confusion between tin-glazed majolica/maiolica and the lead-glazed majolica made in England and America in the 19th century, but they are different in origin, technique, style and history. In the late 18th century, old Italian maiolica became popular among [...] the British, who referred to it by the anglicized pronunciation majolica. The Minton pottery copied it and applied the term majolica ware to their product. At the Great Exhibition of 1851, Minton launched the colorful lead-glazed earthenware which they called Palissy ware soon also to become known as majolica. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> have two distinct products with the same name. [...] "In the 1870s, the curators of the South Kensington Museum returned to the original Italian 'maiolica' with an 'i' to describe all Italian tin-glazed earthenware, doubtless to stress the Italian pronunciation and to avoid confusion with contemporary majolica." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hugo {{copyrights}} {{were acquired}} by the German game publisher Krea Medie A/S, {{a part of the}} media company Kraemedie. New Hugo owner Henrik Kølle stated in October 2012 that Hugo Games A/S [...] "is happy that the traditional Hugo countries, where Hugo was aired in the '90s, still love Hugo and seemingly can’t get enough of him. [...] Angry Birds have shown us the way here, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> are hard at work on, among other things, a film project, exciting licensing deals for toys and finally we hope to release another Hugo game in time for summer 2013." [...] On 28 November 2012, Krea Medie was acquired by Egmont Group, but Hugo Games and the rights to Hugo were not part of the sale agreement with Egmont. A possible new Hugo live show was hinted in July 2014. Hugo Games is owned and managed by Henry Mallet, and was valued at DKK 56 million and generating an annual income of about DKK 10 million as estimated in September 2014 when the company was listed for investment as HUGO NewHold ApS.|$|E
2500|$|In November, IGN held {{a second}} online chat with Zeschuk, Falkner, {{programmer}} Marc Audy, lead tester Karl Schreiner, and tester Derrick Collins. Zeschuk stated Sony had recently {{looked at the}} game and been very impressed; [...] "They felt the gameplay improvements we've made (overall better balancing and reworking parts of every level), combined with the difficulty levels and slick controls really make MDK2: Armageddon for PS2 the definitive version of the game." [...] Speaking of his earlier problems with video memory, Faulkner said [...] "the video memory situation has improved dramatically since last time. The problem {{was that there was}} too little video memory to fit all our textures, and the machine can't use a texture unless it's specifically in video memory. What we've found since then is that the PS2 has enough bus bandwidth to transfer each texture from main memory to video memory as it's needed. That's on the order of hundreds of MB per second. We hadn't anticipated that the PS2 had that kind of brute horsepower on its bus. We had to reorient our thinking after that. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> have almost more texture memory than we know what to do with." ...|$|E
2500|$|First and foremost, {{cultural}} diplomacy is {{a demonstration of}} national power because it demonstrates to foreign audiences every aspect of culture, including wealth, scientific and technological advances, competitiveness in everything from sports and industry to military power, and a nation's overall confidence. [...] The perception of power obviously {{has important implications for}} a nation's ability to ensure its security. [...] Furthermore, because {{cultural diplomacy}} includes political and ideological arguments, and uses the language of persuasion and advocacy, it can be used as an instrument of political warfare and be useful in achieving traditional goals of war. [...] A Chinese activist was quoted as saying [...] "We've seen a lot of Hollywood movies- they feature weddings, funerals and going to court. [...] <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> think it's only natural to go to court a few times in your life." [...] This {{is an example of a}} cultural export- Hollywood movies, possibly having a subtle effect on the legal system in China, which could ultimately benefit the United States or any other nation which wishes to see a more democratic China. [...] This is the way in which ideas and perceptions can ultimately affect the ability of a nation to achieve its national security goals.|$|E

2500|$|On February 8, {{during his}} Grammy Awards red carpet interview, West {{explained}} how the collaboration came to fruition: [...] "I'm {{executive producer of}} Rihanna's album, and I said I'd done a few songs with Paul McCartney and she couldn't get past this record. She had to have it on her album... <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> at the Grammys doing it". West further compared Rihanna's vocals on the song to that of Scottish singer Annie Lennox: [...] "I feel like she has this type of energy in her vocals. And she even brought it to another level of like soul and heart and artistry". In an interview with V magazine, Rihanna revealed, [...] "The thing that made me {{fall in love with}} [...] is the juxtaposition of the music and the lyrics. When you read the lyrics it's a completely different song than what you are hearing. The music is easygoing, but the lyrical content is very loud and in your face." [...] Although it is a first collaboration by the trio, they have collaborated separately. West and McCartney collaborated on the 2014 single [...] "Only One", a track dedicated to West's daughter North. Rihanna and West previously collaborated on Jay-Z's 2009 single [...] "Run This Town" [...] — which became a commercial success and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — and West's 2011 single [...] "All of the Lights", a track featuring backup vocals by John Legend, Fergie, and Elton John among others.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Bungle emerged {{after its}} members were kicked out their {{respective}} bands. [...] "It was kinda like a merger between two bands," [...] Mike Patton recalled. [...] "One really horrible gothic metal band, which our guitarist and original drummer were in, and one really horrible metal band which did Metallica covers, {{which is the}} one Trevor and me came from." [...] Mr. Bungle initially described themselves as a death metal band, but also dabbled in speed metal, thrash metal, and hardcore punk. And {{within a year of}} formation, the band expanded their sound to include ska. Trevor Dunn noted that, [...] "After about a year we got tired of playing speed metal and wanted to do something a little more creative. So we just stopped and started writing our own style of music, which was influenced by bands like Camper Van Beethoven, Oingo Boingo, Bad Manners and kind of ska funk-ish oriented stuff. Then we added a two-piece horn section and a new drummer, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> don't really have any kind of limit on the music we play." [...] Trey Spruance corroborated this. “When I was 15, I was in a death metal group," [...] Spruance reminisced. [...] "We had this idea {{that we were going to}} play a bunch of ska tunes for a bunch of metalheads. We just had this idea, you know: ‘Okay, we’re going to play this ska music, and that’ll be amazing.’ Half of the audience hated us, but there was definitely a joy in confronting that wall between styles.” ...|$|E
