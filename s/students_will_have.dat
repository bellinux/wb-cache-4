25|$|Throughout this curriculum, Preuss {{students}} are required to take courses at the advanced placement (AP) level, when offered. This requirement is meant to improve the students' chances for college admission and {{to reduce the number of}} college courses these low-income students might later have to take and pay for. By graduation, all Preuss <b>students</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> taken at least six AP courses.|$|E
25|$|Because the TAG admissions {{process is}} selective- {{one of the}} {{definitions}} of a TAG student is a national-norm math score of “82” or higher- a TAG student enters the school having already taken Algebra. In some cases, as is such with alumni of William B. Travis Academy, <b>students</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> completed both Algebra and Geometry before even leaving middle school.|$|E

Each day a <b>student</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> two 80 minute classes and four 50 minute classes. Each <b>student</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> a total of eight scheduled classes with only six classes occurring each day.

5000|$|In general, {{the first}} two years of study are devoted to {{completion}} of coursework and the comprehensive examinations. At this stage, the student is known as a [...] "Ph.D. student" [...] or [...] "doctoral student". It is usually expected that the <b>student</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> completed most of his or her required coursework by the end of this stage. Furthermore, it is usually required that by the end of eighteen to thirty-six months after the first registration, the <b>student</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> successfully completed the comprehensive exams.|$|R
25|$|Taiwan's medical {{education}} began in 1897 and is over 100 years old now. Students graduate with a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. Starting {{from the year}} 2013, incoming <b>students</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> a 6+2 year curriculum, in which the first 6 years are oriented similarly as before and {{the last two years}} are Post Graduate Years; this change aims to increase primary care capabilities of medical school graduates.|$|E

25|$|Similar to {{a long-running}} program {{in place at}} Winston Churchill High School, an advisor program was {{introduced}} in the fall of 2006. The program consists of an 8-minute session between the first two periods during which students of all grades meet with a teacher to whom they were randomly assigned {{at the beginning of the}} year. More personal than that of the counselling department, the program offers the opportunity for students to seek advice from an influential adult. Administrative duties, such as public announcements and the handing out of report cards and newsletters, is done in sessions. Advisors also make mid-semester phone-home reports to parents. Most students do not have their advisor as a classroom instructor. In most circumstances, <b>students</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> the same advisor for all four years of high school.|$|E
25|$|St Andrews is characterised amongst Scottish {{universities}} {{as having}} {{a significant number of}} students who live in university-maintained accommodation. As of 2012, 52% of the student population live in university halls. The halls vary widely in age and character; the oldest, Deans Court dates from the 12th century, and the newest, David Russell Apartments, was built in 2004. They are built in styles from gothic revival to brutalist. All are now co-educational and non-smoking, and several are catered. The University guarantees every first year student a place of accommodation, and many students return to halls in their second, third and final years at St Andrews. From September 2015 onwards, <b>students</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> the option of living in alcohol-free flats in David Russell Apartments on the grounds of medical conditions that do not allow drinking or for religious reasons.|$|E
25|$|Admission {{for senior}} high schools, {{especially}} selective high schools, is somewhat {{similar to the}} one for universities in China. Students will go through an application system where they may choose the high schools at which they wish to study in an order to their preference before the high schools set out their entrance requirements. Once this is completed and the high schools will announce their requirements based on this information and the places they will offer in that year. For instance, if the school offers 800 places in that year, the results offered by the 800th intake student will be the standard requirements. So effectively, this ensures the school selects the top candidates in all the students who have applied to said school in that academic year. However, the severe competition only occurs in the very top high schools, normally, most <b>students</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> sufficient results for them to continue their secondary education if they wish to.|$|E

2500|$|After {{six years}} of Primary education, <b>students</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to sit for the {{national}} Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).

Students are also admitted into a secondary school under a separate [...] "Direct School Admission" [...] scheme, whereby secondary schools are able to choose {{a certain number of}} students based on their special talents before these students take the PSLE. Students admitted under this scheme cannot select their schools based on their PSLE results.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} a long {{tradition}} of creating molecular models from physical materials. Perhaps the best known is Crick and Watson's model of DNA built from rods and planar sheets, but the most widely used approach is to represent all atoms and bonds explicitly using the [...] "ball and stick" [...] approach. This can demonstrate a wide range of properties, such as shape, relative size, and flexibility. Many chemistry courses expect that <b>students</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> access to ball and stick models. One goal of mainstream molecular graphics has been to represent the [...] "ball and stick" [...] model as realistically as possible and to couple this with calculations of molecular properties.|$|E

Approximately 25% of students major in the social sciences; 10% in psychology; 11% in engineering; 10% in biology; 9% in history; and 10% in the humanities; while some 5% design their own majors.

50|$|Block {{scheduling}} differs {{significantly from}} a traditional schedule. At Saint Joseph Academy, each student has only four 85-minute classes per day.

2500|$|... "Special" [...] and [...] "Express" [...] are {{four-year}} courses {{leading up}} to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE [...] "O" [...] Level examination. The difference between these two courses is that in the [...] "Special" [...] stream, students take 'Higher Mother Tongue' (available for Standard Mandarin, Malay and Tamil only) instead of 'Mother Tongue'. A pass in the Higher Mother Tongue 'O' Level Examination constitutes the fulfilment of the Mother Tongue requirement in Singapore, whereas Normal Mother Tongue <b>Students</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to go through one more year of study in their Mother Tongue after their 'O' Levels to take the 'A' Level H1 Mother Tongue Examinations and fulfil the MOE's requirement. A foreign language, either French, German, Japanese or Spanish can be taken in addition to the mother tongue or can replace it. This is especially popular with students who are struggling with their mother tongues, expatriates, or students returning from abroad. Non-Chinese students may also study Standard Mandarin and non-Malay students Malay as a third language. This programme is known as CSP (Chinese Special Programme) and MSP (Malay Special Programme). Mother Tongue teachers conduct these lessons in school after usual hours. Students of Higher Mother Tongue languages are allowed to have up to two points taken off their O-level scoring, unless the student's Higher Mother Tongue is used as their L1 in computation of L1R5. a scoring system discussed below where a lower value is considered better, if they meet set benchmarks. The Ministry of Education Language Centre (MOELC) provides free language education for most additional languages that other schools may not cover, and provides the bulk of such education, admitting several thousand students each year.|$|E

Once the 75 seconds have ended, the starting pitch will be played again, and the <b>student</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> 30 seconds to perform the piece.

As with the melodic dictation {{part of the}} exam, one piece will generally be compound in meter and major in key, while the other will be simple in meter and minor in key.
