We find that galaxy-galaxy interactions could generate either positive and negative gas-phase oxygen profiles depending on the state of evolution. Along the interaction, galaxies are found to have metallicity gradients and sSFR consistent with observations, on average. <b>Strong</b> <b>gas</b> inflows produced during galaxy-galaxy interactions or as a result of strong local instabilities in gas-rich discs are able to produce both a quick dilution of the central gas-phase metallicity and a sudden increase of the sSFR.

Simulated galaxies without experiencing strong disturbances evolve smoothly without modifying the metallicity gradients. Gas-rich systems show large dispersion along the correlation. The dispersion in the observed relation could be interpreted as produced by the combination of galaxies with different gas-richness and/or experiencing different types of interactions.

Sasol plants gasify {{more than}} 30 million {{tons per annum}} of coal via the Fischer- Tropsch process {{resulting}} {{in the production of}} synthesis gas and a condensate stream. After gravimetric separation of the tar products, the solvent extraction of phenolics and the steam stripping of ammonia from the condensate stream, a complex effluent referred to as stripped <b>gas</b> <b>liquor</b> (SGL) is generated. SGL {{has the potential to be}} used as process cooling water. Micro-organisms, scale deposit and corrosion are three major problems associated with the operation of cooling water systems. Parameters that have an influence on the fouling, scaling and corrosion of industrial cooling towers include cycles of concentration (COC), flow velocity (FV) and pH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of COC, pH and FV on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as on the microbial community dynamics in cooling towers using SGL as process cooling water. Stripped <b>gas</b> <b>liquor</b> contains hydrocarbons which can interfere with PLFA analysis. There was, therefore, a need to optimise the selective extraction of hydrocarbons so as to eliminate their interference with PLFA analysis. The method used for the extraction of hydrocarbons before silicic acid fractionation succeeded in removing the hydrocarbons and their interference and was, therefore, determined to be appropriate method to use in subsequent analyses. Even though the two lab-scale cooling towers were of identical design their similarity or dissimilarity needed investigation. Physico-chemical analysis results confirmed that the two cooling towers were operated under identical operational conditions. The two cooling towers were found to be similar in terms of the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates as well as microbial community structure. The two cooling towers could be operated in parallel using different operational conditions with any differences in results being a reflection of the effects of operational conditions. The effects of pH, FV and COC on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as microbial community dynamics were evaluated with the aid of a 2 ³ multi-factorial experimental design. Cycles of concentration was found to have the most profound effect on the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates followed by pH. Cycles of concentration and pH were found to have the most profound effect on microbial community dynamics. The use of the 2 ³ multi-factorial experimental design also allowed the determination of optimal conditions for the operation of,the cooling towers using SGE as feed water. These conditions were found to be 5 COC, a pH of 7. 5 and a FV of 0. 6 m/s. In conclusion, the use of a 2 ³ factorial experimental design, physico-chemical, PLFA and DGGE analyses were instrumental in the successful determination of the effects of COC, pH and FV on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as on the microbial community dynamics in the cooling towers using SGL as process cooling water.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a cold {{radiating}} plasma boundary has been proposed as a solution {{of the problem of}} power exhaust in magnetically confined fusion plasmas. In the tokamak TEXTOR the injection of impurities (neon, silicon or argon) leads to the formation of a radiating plasma boundary where up to 90 % of the input power can be distributed to large wall areas, thereby strongly reducing the convective heat flux density onto the plasma facing components. At high plasma densities the impurity seeding leads to a transition to an improved confinement state, termed the Radiative Improved Mode (RI-mode). This operational scenario combines high density and high confinement with power exhaust by radiation under quasi-stationary discharge conditions. The plasma density can be further increased by external gas fuelling, while the high confinement is maintained, if the gas is fuelled at a moderate rate. In contrast, <b>strong</b> <b>gas</b> fuelling leads to a confinement degradation back to the normal L-mode level. We have used plasma diagnostics based on optical methods to characterise particle, energy and neutral transport at the plasma boundary. When the radiated power is increased owing to the injected impurities, we observe a strong reduction of the plasma temperature at the plasma boundary. At the same time, the particle transport out of the confined volume decreases, accordingly the neutral flux back into the plasma decreases. In discharges, where the density is increased by <b>strong</b> <b>gas</b> fuelling and the energy confinement degrades, we observe a built-up of edge density and neutral pressure owing to a higher recycling coefficient. In contrast, with moderate gas fuelling the edge density and neutral pressure remain low. While the seeded impurities cause a substantial dilution at the plasma edge, the plasma core is much less affected, leading to hollow impurity concentration profiles. Operation at the highest densities is favourable with respect to the release of impurities at the edge as well as with respect to the resulting impurity content in the plasma bulk. The most prominent change of transport in the plasma core is a steepening of background density profile while the temperature in the core can be maintained or even slightly increased. The global energy confinement is strongly correlated with the density peaking. An analysis of the experimental plasma profiles with respect to stability against the ion temperature gradient driven mode (ITG mode) shows that the ITG mode is substantially reduced during the confinement improvement and that it reappears if the density is increased and a subsequent confinement roll-over occurs with too a <b>strong</b> <b>gas</b> fuelling. The dynamics of both the confinement improvement and of the degradation is initiated at the plasma edge. The resulting changes in the plasma core amplify the initial trigger. Consequently, we observe a non-linear interplay between edge and core which allows for a self-organisation of the plasma and a bifurcation between two rather different states. The transition and the changes of the plasma profiles can be described in agreement with the experimental findings by a transport model based on the ITC mode and the dissipative trapped electron (DTE-) mode, which is connected to a strong anomalous particle pinch. This inward pinch leads to the steepening of the density profile once the ITG mode growth is reduced by the impurities. During the confinement degradation with <b>strong</b> <b>gas</b> injection increased edge transport leads to a reduction of the impurity content in the core below the level needed for the ITC suppression...|$|R

40|$|An actual {{subject of}} {{experimental}} and theoretical studies in present day fusion {{research is the}} development of an operational scenario combining simultaneously high confinement, with at least H-mode quality, and high densities, around or above the empirical Greenwald limit. Recently, this subject was studied in TEXTOR radiative improved (RI) mode discharges, in which the seeding of a small amount of impurities is helpful in a transition to the improved confinement stage. It was found that by the careful tailoring of external fuelling and optimisation of the wall conditions it is possible to maintain the H-mode or even higher quality confinement at densities much above Greenwald density limit. However, more intense fuelling, aimed to extend maximal achievable densities, led to the progressive confinement deterioration. The theory explains the transition to the RI-mode as a bifurcation into the stage where the transport governed by the ion temperature gradient (ITG) instability is significantly reduced due to a high density gradient and high value of the effective charge. The numerical studies of an influence of the gas puff intensity on confinement properties of plasma, done {{with the help of the}} 1 -D transport code RITM, show that the same theory can be used for an explanation of the confinement rollover triggered by a <b>strong</b> <b>gas</b> puff. The code was modified in order to simulate the effect of the gas puff on the confinement properties. The anomalous transport coefficients in the plasma core include contributions from the ITG and dissipative trapped electron (DTE) instabilities. The transport at the plasma edge under RI-mode conditions might be described by the electrostatic turbulence caused by electric currents in the scrape-off layer of the limiter. The present computations show that this assumption for the edge transport does not allow the modeling of an effect of the gas puff intensity on the profiles evolution in agreement with experimental observations. The level of the edge transport must be increased significantly in order to reproduce the evolution of the plasma density and the effective ion charge profiles during confinement degradation caused by a <b>strong</b> <b>gas</b> puff. An increase of this order is in agreement with reflectometer measurements and could tentatively be explained by the effect of neutrals on Drift Resistive Ballooning instability. Although, an increase of the edge transport is a necessary condition for the core confinement deterioration, the latter is produced by the resumption of ITG instability in the plasma core. The present studies show, that the reduction of impurity content of plasma and high positive time derivative of the density provided by a <b>strong</b> <b>gas</b> puff are crucial conditions for the restart of the ITG mode.
