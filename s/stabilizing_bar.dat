This study investigates {{floodplain}} deposits in the braided Ngaruroro River, New Zealand, to characterize and quantify the spatial extent of deposits {{at different stages of}} development. Using a sequence of aerial photography, depositional surfaces were mapped and then assigned a floodplain development stage based on age, the discharge causing inundation, and field observations of sediment and vegetation characteristics. The ensemble of floodplain deposits makes up 40 % of the river valley, the remainder being the active river bed. <b>Stabilizing</b> <b>bars</b> and mature floodplains dominate the floodplain ensemble. While the existence of <b>stabilizing</b> <b>bars</b> points to a recent shift or fluctuation in controlling conditions, the extent and location of mature units suggest an earlier change in hydrologic and sediment supply conditions that limited braidtrain mobility. Mosaics of different aged deposits range from simple two-stage mosaics to more complex arrangements of three and four stages.

This would lead to relevant advantages, such as a lower invasive impact of implantation and a shorter timing of treatment, with the patient regaining total masticatory functionality within the immediate post operative stage. In order to optimize the immediate load protocol and to foster implant osseointegration, the Italian Implantology School has developed soldering techniques by welding one or more <b>stabilizing</b> <b>bars.</b> Welding techniques allow obtaining a better primary stability in the early post-operatory period in comparison with non-supported implants, as micromovements are reduced and stress/strain distribution at bone-implant interface is more balanced. The present essay “Biomechanical stress analysis of bone-implant interface” is intended to study the distribution of stress/strain exerted by masticatory loads onto the peri-implant bone, with a view to decide whether the bar may be removed by completion of the healing process without relevant impact on bone strain. Secondly, it will be estimated whether the use of two bars undersized in diameter and symmetric to the implant can be compared with the application of one bar only.

40|$|Stellar {{bars are}} the most common non-axisymmetric {{structures}} in galaxies and their impact on the evolution of disc galaxies at all cosmological times can be significant. Classical theory predicts that stellar discs are <b>stabilized</b> against <b>bar</b> formation if embedded in massive spheroidal dark matter halos. However, dark matter halos have been shown to facilitate the growth of bars through resonant gravitational interaction. Still, it remains unclear why some galaxies are barred and some are not. In this study, we demonstrate that co-rotating (i. e., in the same sense as the disc rotating) dark matter halos with spin parameters in the range of 0 <λ_dm< 0. 07 - which are a definite prediction of modern cosmological models - promote the formation of bars and boxy bulges and therefore can {{play an important role in}} the formation of pseudobulges in a kinematically hot dark matter dominated disc galaxies. We find continuous trends for models with higher halo spins: bars form more rapidly, the forming slow bars are stronger, and the final bars are longer. After 2 Gyrs of evolution, the amplitude of the bar mode in a model with λ_dm = 0. 05 is a factor of 6 times higher, A_ 2 /A_ 0 = 0. 23, than in the non-rotating halo model. After 5 Gyrs, the bar is 2. 5 times longer. The origin of this trend is that more rapidly spinning (co-rotating) halos provide a larger fraction of trailing dark matter particles that lag behind the disc bar and help growing the bar by taking away its angular momentum by resonant interactions. A counter-rotating halo suppresses the formation of a bar in our models. We discuss potential consequences for forming galaxies at high-redshift and present day low mass galaxies which have converted only a small fraction of their baryons into stars.

They exert activities in membrane dynamic processes such as endocytosis, autophagy, mitochondrial dynamics and permeabilization during apoptosis. Here, {{we report on the}} involvement of the third α-helix of endophilins A BAR sequence in dimerization and identify leucine 215 as a key residue within a network of hydrophobic interactions <b>stabilizing</b> the entire <b>BAR</b> dimer interface.

In comparison to wild type, full-length endophilin A 2 heterodimers with one protomer bearing the L 215 D substitution, exhibit very significant changes in membrane-binding and shaping activities as well as dramatic decrease of SH 3 domain partnership. This suggests that subtle changes in the conformation and/or rigidity of the BAR domain impact on both the control of membrane curvature and downstream binding to effectors.

Mild and moderate degrees of deformity should be treated with a deep breathing and exercise program and the vacuum bell. The best age for repair is during puberty, but successful repair in adult patients (up to 70 years of age) has been reported. Those scheduled for minimally invasive repair should be measured for bar length and screened for metal allergies. The minimally invasive technique for pectus excavatum repair is done thoracoscopically and requires no rib cartilage or sternal resection. Instead, it relies on bracing the anterior chest wall with a sub-sternal support bar placed in position under the sternum after first correcting the deformity with an introducer specially developed for the procedure. Two bars generally give better correction than one bar. It is essential that the <b>bars</b> be adequately <b>stabilized</b> to prevent <b>bar</b> displacement and recurrence of the deformity. Several techniques {{have been developed to}} elevate the sternum during mediastinal tunneling to improve thoracoscopic visibility in very severe and asymmetric deformities.

40|$|Using {{numerical}} simulation, {{we study}} {{the development of}} gaseous inflows and triggering of starburst activity in mergers of comparable-mass disk galaxies. In all encounters studied, the galaxies experience strong gaseous inflows and moderate to intense starburst activity. We find that galaxy structure plays a dominant role in regulating activity. The gaseous inflows are strongest when galaxies with dense central bulges are {{in the final stages}} of merging, while inflows in bulgeless galaxies are weaker and occur earlier in the interaction. Orbital geometry plays only a relatively modest role in the onset of collisionally-induced activity. Through an analysis of the torques acting on the gas, we show that these inflows are generally driven by gravitational torques from the host galaxy (rather than the companion), and that dense bulges act to <b>stabilize</b> galaxies against <b>bar</b> modes and inflow until the galaxies merge, at which point rapidly varying gravitational torques drive strong dissipation and inflow of gas in the merging pair. The strongest inflows (and associated starburst activity) develop in co-planar encounters, while the activity in inclined mergers is somewhat less intense and occurs slightly later during the merger. The starbursts which develop in mergers of galaxies with central bulges represent an increase in the star formation rate of two orders of magnitude over that in isolated galaxies. We find that the gaseous and stellar morphology and star-forming properties of these systems provide a good match to those of observed ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Our results imply that the internal structure of the merging galaxies, rather than orbital geometry, may be the key factor in producing ultraluminous infrared galaxies.

40|$|This is a PhD thesis by {{publication}} {{which consists}} of five papers. Each manuscript focuses on a different aspect of {{the understanding of the}} origin and controls on the development of anabranching rivers. Anabranching rivers have been defined as a system of multiple channels characterized by stable alluvial islands that divide flows at discharges up to nearly bankfull; they are the least understood river type. Better understanding of fluvial styles and their deposits is crucial to improve characterization of fluvial petroleum reservoirs. The lateral continuity of sand-bodies as well as sandstone and mudstone distributions are often hard to predict, especially when channel bodies are below seismic resolution. In such cases, reliance on modern analogues and scaling relationships are essential. To explore the relationship between facies distribution and changes in river style, we conducted a field investigation of a reach that presents a change from single channel to anabranching in the dryland Neales River, Australia (Paper 1). An additional motivation for focusing our investigation on a dryland case study is that dryland endorheic basins have been prevalent throughout geological history and their deposits can be of significant economic importance as hydrocarbon reservoirs. Based on the grain size and channel geometry (width and depth) data presented in this paper we conclude that the planform geomorphology exerts a greater control on channel bed material size than channel geometry. Therefore, to investigate the factors controlling the change between single channel to anabranching in this reach of the Neales River, sedimentologic, topographic, geologic, and remote sensing data were collected (Paper 2). We propose that the development of anabranching in this site is related to a downstream change in floodplain width, which occurs downstream of a fault, due to a lithological change from more resistive to more erosive substrate. Statistically significantly larger floodplain width values in the anabranching reach compared to the single channel reach allow me to propose that the change in floodplain width is a primary control in the development of anabranching. This is in accordance with other Australian anabranching rivers, highlighting that a change in floodplain width seems to be necessary for the development of anabranching; as opposed to the control on floodplain width itself. To investigate the mechanisms that unravel which conditions are necessary within a fluvial system for a downstream increase in floodplain width to result in the development of anabranching we carried out a series of morphodynamic numerical simulations using boundary conditions from field-scale modern anabranching rivers spanning different climatic and geologic settings as well as hypothetical floodplain aspect ratios (Paper 3). We propose that anabranching rivers can originate from alluvial bar growth similar to the origin of braided rivers. This occurs on floodplains where the flow has a large aspect ratio (width divided by depth), which favors bar growth and the development of anabranching systems. Floodplains with large aspect ratios favor the development of anabranching because the reduction in bar-top shear stress caused by emergence of deep anabranches <b>stabilizes</b> the <b>bar</b> and hastens their transition to large, immobile islands. Compared with field measurements, our simulations accurately predict the number of active channels, supporting the validity of this explanation for the origin of anabranching rivers. Avulsion has been proposed as another mechanism for anabranch formation. However, {{little is known about the}} thresholds that trigger avulsion, partly because of the scarcity of ongoing avulsions and because of our inability to predict when they will occur in order to be able to observe them. To gain further insight into avulsion processes, and the generation of new anabranching channels, we investigated a 2007 avulsion event that took place in one of the anabranching reaches of the tropical Magdalena River, Colombia (Paper 4). This was selected because it forms an excellent example of a recent avulsion that led to the formation of anabranching channels, and had not previously been investigated. On a regional scale, the location of the avulsion node seems to be related to changes in gradient caused by a fault. On a reach scale the position of the avulsion node seems to be linked to the location of the channel’s thalweg, which is up against the bank where the avulsion node is located. The trigger of the avulsion and maintenance of the newly avulsed channels can be ascribed to high discharge magnitudes related to the 2007 - 2008 and 2010 - 2011 extreme La Niña events. To test this trigger hypothesis on a larger temporal and spatial scale, we collected a record of satellite images from three South American rivers, hundreds of kilometers apart (Paper 5) and recorded the occurrences of avulsion activity during 41 years and 12 La Niña events. Results show that the frequency of avulsion activity significantly increases during La Niña conditions. Discharge data from one of the case-studies (the Magdalena River) suggests that this is ultimately related to increases in the magnitude of river discharge during the cold phase of ENSO. We suggest that the intensity of la Niña occurrences seems to play a significant role in the triggering and development of partial and full avulsions because the onset of three events reported in this study corresponds to strong La Niña phenomena (1975 - 1976, 1998 - 1999, 2007 - 2008 and 2010 - 2011). This thesis contributes to the understanding of the origin and controls on the development of anabranching rivers by using a variety of field, remote sensing and novel modeling approaches. The anabranching rivers investigated in this thesis are located in four continents, spanning different climatic and tectonic settings. I have contributed new field observations for previously unstudied anabranching rivers (Neales and Magdalena rivers) in two of the least-well studied climate zones for anabranching. The hypotheses presented in this thesis are globally applicable as they are based on first order controls (floodplain width and ENSO) ad mechanisms (bar formation and avulsion). Thesis (Ph. D.)
