It makes use of survey information to identify two types of firm {{on the basis of}} exchange rate sensitivity of their sales volume and input prices, as being either exporters and importers. We then examine the relationship between the exchange rate and the share price of individual firms in our <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>importer</b> and exporter firms. This is done for the period 1990 to June 1997 and the sub-periods October 1990 to August 1992, when the UK participated in the exchange rate mechanism, and August 1995 to June 1997, a period of sterling appreciation. The results showed a stronger currency effect on firm value during the ERM period than when sterling free-floated. The analysis is then extended to examining the effects of a range of individual currencies and indicate that individual firms have very different exposures to particular currencies. Overall our results indicate a weak relationship between our sample firms' share price and changes in the exchange rate.

A partial test of resource-advantage theory is conducted, examining {{the relationship between}} four intangible capital elements on marketing capabilities and consequent firm performance. The results, based upon <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> 239 <b>importers</b> in Japan and the U. S., indicate that human capital and relational capital influenced marketing capabilities, and that marketing capabilities influenced performance similarly across institutional environments. Organizational capital, however, was found to only influence marketing capabilities for U. S. importers. Furthermore, our results indicate full mediation in both samples.

40|$|Since the 1960 ’s, the EU {{has offered}} trade {{preferences}} {{to developing countries}} in {{a complex set of}} systems. Broadly these systems can be divided into preferences for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, Mediterranean preferences and the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). We construct a detailed database over these trade preferences and use it to assess whether they have had an effect on developing countries’ exports and whether the systems have had different impact on exports. To achieve this we also estimate the effect of the successive EU enlargements on exports from developing countries. A gravity model taking into account the evolution of developing countries’ exports is estimated on a large <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> EU <b>importers</b> and developing country exporters over the period 1960 - 2002. The main findings are that certain preference systems have had large effects—the largest are found for the ACP countries, where the preferences increase exports by about 30 %, followed by Mediterranean countries—and that, countries joining the EU, ceteris paribus, import less from developing countries as they become members.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the value drivers of the {{unethical}} marketing behavior of exporters, {{as seen from the}} perspective <b>of</b> their <b>importers,</b> and how this in turn affects the quality of their working relationship and performance. Based on a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> 189 Cypriot <b>importers,</b> the study revealed that similarities in national, corporate, and personal values between importers and their foreign suppliers are negatively related to unethical marketing practices of the latter as perceived by the former, and vice versa. Perceived export marketing unethicality, in turn, negatively influences the exporter-importer relationship quality (as expressed in terms of cooperation, communication, trust, and commitment), which subsequently has harmful effects on the performance of the relationship. In addition, the existence of a high similarity in both value strength and ethical codes between importers and their export suppliers was found to positively affect the quality of the working relationship. Finally, the association of both corporate and personal values similarity with perceived export marketing unethicality was found to be moderated by network ties, although this was not evident in the case of national values similarity. The findings of the study have important implications for import managers in terms of properly selecting and handling relationships with their foreign suppliers...|$|R
40|$|Despite trends towards growing {{globalization}} {{of the world}} economy, the further development of import trade is still hindered {{by a number of}} barriers. Based on a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> 100 Cypriot <b>importers,</b> an attempt is made {{to assess the impact of}} these barriers on import behaviour. Overall, these barriers were found to have only a modest effect, with greatest concern expressed for those hindering competitiveness in buying from abroad. In analyzing barriers according to the principal origin of imports, with a few exceptions, no significant differences were observed. A factor analysis combined import barriers into six dimensions, with 'competition-related problems' being the most influential. In investigating the relevance of firm characteristics on import barrier dimensions, the latter were highly but inversely associated with business experience and company size. Of the six dimensions, 'adverse foreign conditions' exhibited a strong link with most of the firm attributes examined. International business Import barriers Firm characteristics Cyprus...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the quality of}} exports depends on relative country size and its remoteness. Specific transportation cost is the key variable in our analysis as it {{gives rise to the}} Alchian-Allen effect. In the model, we allow for endogenous quality choice by a producer serving many international locations. Higher quality comes at higher marginal cost of production, but can be delivered at the same absolute, and thus proportionally lower, transportation cost to a given destination. Our model complements the well documented demandside response to the distribution of transportation costs (known as the Alchian-Allen effect) by the supply side response. We show that, ceteris paribus, equilibrium quality decreases in the domestic country size and increases in remoteness from foreign markets. This happens because a larger portion of the demand is affected by the Alchian-Allen effect for smaller countries’ producers, and the Alchian-Allen effect is stronger for remote countries. We confirm our predictions empirically on a detailed product level dataset of all exporters worldwide into a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> Latin American <b>importers.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This work envisages {{minimizing}} many shortcomings including associated {{delays in}} the cargo clearance process when the import and export certificate which is legally known as license/permit become applicable. Preliminary survey conducted revealed that there is undue delay. The work then systematically identifies the factors that hamper efficient and effective enforcement of such regulations in the import and export of goods in the Sri Lankan context. A questionnaire was circulated among a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> 100 <b>importers</b> and exporters or their representatives in order to gather information on ground level practical problems faced by them. Existing laws and regulations as well as regulatory processes at several agencies were examined to identify the correct legal position and any existing automated solutions. Various authorities were interviewed {{in order to identify}} their requirements as well as the problems they face. It was found that in almost all the instances manual procedures are in use in the issuance of certificates (licenses/permits) and in subsequent debit/write-off steps introducing delays, duplications and poor control effects. The study shows that certain commodities require certificates from more than one regulatory agency for identical purpose. It is recommended that Automated Certificate Processing System be put into use integrated with the existing Customs Automated System. It is also recommended that the simplification and standardizing of procedures at regulatory agencies as well as at Customs need to be carried out before introducing an automated system. Proposed e-Certificate system will not only expedite the clearance process but also will prevent the certificates being misused. Much superior controls could be implemented as online information will be available for all regulatory agencies. Main goal of the proposal is to eliminate paper requirement and pave the way for paperless trade in Sri Lanka...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the effect of {{non-tariff}} measures, specifically the Sanitary and Phytosanitary - SPS and Technical Barriers to Trade - TBT, on brazilian exports of tobacco and if this effect remained in the periods following the issuance of notifications. For that a gravity model was estimated using a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> 89 <b>importer’s</b> brazilian tobacco between 1997 to 2011. The method used in the estimation of equations was the model Poisson-Pseudo Maximum Likehood (PPML). The results show that the sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) affect the international flow of trade in tobacco negatively. Furthermore, was verified that this effect persisted during the periods after the issuance notification, and exporting companies can take up to 2 years to adjust the requirements set. Among the objectives of SPS notifications, most are related to measures for the protection of human health and protection of the plant, which may explain the greater difficulty of adaptation, since they are requirements that require large investments. The technical measures (TBT) were not statically significant, confirming a non-tariff such notifications on international trade in tobacco. Although most of the notifications to tobacco are associated with technical measures, the results indicated that they have not configured as barriers to trade in tobacco. This may suggest that the requirements referred to them, which was mostly related to labeling and / or packaging, were attended by Brazil without difficulty. Thus, it becomes important to include questions concerning the regulation of these measures in the discussions and decision-making processes of companies exporting tobacco. In terms of government actions, it would be interesting to establishment or enhancement of policies to increase the informative character of health measures, particularly those involving issues related to human health and plant protection, in order to reduce the time that exporters use to conform to such requirements...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{commitment}} has emerged recently in international business literature especially in explaining importer behaviour as a counterpart {{of the process}} <b>of</b> internationalisation. <b>Importer</b> commitment often plays a dominant role {{as one of the}} major factors influencing relationships in the exporter-importer dyad and facilitates the process of internationalisation by imparting access to the international market. This critical importer and supplier relationship and its animating factors are, however, overlooked and largely neglected in the literature. Accordingly, it is inconclusive as to which factors influence importer commitment and how they influence it. Drawing on the literature, this study strived to investigate the spectrum <b>of</b> <b>importer</b> commitment and has explicitly examined eight factors influencing importer commitment to a foreign supplier by integrating the factors in a comprehensive model. Cultural similarity between importer and overseas supplier, knowledge and experience <b>of</b> the <b>importer,</b> the supplier's competencies, communication between importer and supplier, the supplier's opportunism, the importer's trust, importer transaction-specific investment, and environmental volatility of the import market have been identified as possible antecedents <b>of</b> <b>importer</b> commitment. Theoretical foundations are drawn basically from transaction cost economics, internationalisation process theory and resource-based theory of the firm to design a basic framework for quantitative investigation. Further, the study endeavors to gain important insights into the phenomena related to the trust and commitment building process through qualitative in-depth interviews. In addition, to validate the qualitative reasoning, a competing quantitative model is developed where trust plays a mediating role for some of the predictor variables in the model. Primary data were collected from a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> 232 industrial and commercial importers in a developing country for empirical verification of the quantitative models using Structural Equation Modeling. As reported in this thesis, the proposed model with minor modifications fit better with the data compared to the competing model, and it explained 56...|$|R
