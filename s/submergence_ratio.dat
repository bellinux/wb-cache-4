40|$|Bubble pump (BP), an {{essential}} component in coffee percolators, is used to drive solar water heating systems and single pressure absorption refrigerators. However, its mass flow rate cannot be readily predicted. Heat input, tube diameter and <b>submergence</b> <b>ratio</b> affect its mass flow rate. BP has the same working concept as air-lift pump, but its flow is complicated due to the condensation of vapour bubbles. Neither curve fitting models, nor air-lift pump models, can predict the mass flow rate with high fidelity. A new model based on the pumping characteristics of BP is presented and verified by a water based setup at atmospheric pressure. Results show that the average errors for the BP with tube diameter of 6 - 12 mm, and for the BP with <b>submergence</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 5 - 0. 8 are 13 % and 11 %, respectively.

40|$|Vegetation {{roughness}} is {{an important}} parameter in describing flow through river systems. Vegetation impedes the flow, which affects the stage-discharge curve and may increase flood risks. Roughness is often used as a calibration parameter in river models, however when vegetation is allowed to develop naturally in river restoration projects, {{it is important to}} have suitable predictions of the increased resistance caused by the vegetation. There are many formulas available for describing vegetation roughness in one or two dimensional flow, ranging from simple wall roughness approximations to (semi-) empirical or theoretically derived roughness descriptions that are a function of flow and plant characteristics. In this paper a number of roughness descriptions are compared. All descriptions give a reasonable fit to experimental flume data. However, the models show significant deviation when extrapolating to large water depths typical for extreme discharge conditions. Therefore, to identify the suitability of existing methods for flood modeling, more data at large water depths are necessary.

The study was divided naturally into two parts; reentrant-jet cavities and pulsating or trailing-vortex cavities. A correlation parameter has been derived to permit determination of the air-entrainment rates for cavities in the reentrant-jet regime assuming that all the air is lost from the cavity through the reentrant jet. As air was also lost through the tip vortices, some dependence was noted with aspect ratio. Air entrainment was a function of velocity for a given cavitation number and ambient pressure. Cavity instability or pulsation was observed at high air-injection rates for thin cavities. Trailing vortices were observed for thick cavities at the higher injection rates. The frequency of the pulsations tended to increase as the foil approached the free surface.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the various {{hydraulic}} characteristics of vegetated open channel under both emergent and submerged flow conditions with various discharges and flow depths. Cylindrical rigid iron rods of height 10 cm and diameter 6. 5 mm planted in staggered pattern in a tilting hydraulic flume with a vegetal density of 76 per unit bed area of 1 m 2 {{are used to}} simulate the effect of hydraulic characteristics on vegetation in open channel. Measurement of flow velocity inside the stem/vegetation layer under emergent condition indicates that the velocity profile is one layer with almost a uniform constant velocity at all points along the path of longitudinal direction of flow. However, under submerged flow condition, velocity of flow in the surface layer above the top of vegetation is very high and follows logarithmic law. The various hydraulic resistances like vegetal drag coefficient, CD, Manning’s roughness coefficient n, and Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, f {{are found to be}} more for vegetated open channel than open channel without any vegetation. These resistance factors are found to vary with flow depths and <b>submergence</b> <b>ratios</b> whereas channel without vegetation bears a constant roughness coefficient. Under submerged flow conditions, when the depth of flow increases, values of n and f are found to decrease but values of CD are found to increase. However, under emergent flow conditions, reverse trends are noticed. Values of CD, n and f are found to increase with increasing depth of flow. Equations have been shown to predict the stem/vegetation layer velocity under both emergent and submerged flow cases. The calculated velocities are found to be close to the observed velocities indicating that the developed equation can be used to predict the flow for both emergent and submerged conditions.

The eighty-year-old single pressure absorption refrigeration system invented by Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard is attractive as it has no mechanical moving parts and can be driven by heat alone. However, the literature on either the refrigeration system or its components is scarce. The bubble pump is the crucial component of the refrigeration system, but it is poorly understood as its mass flow rate cannot be readily predicted. Two new time correlations in the mass flow rate prediction are presented to increase the accuracy when heat losses occur in the bubble pump. These time correlations are verified with the experimental results. When either the heat input or <b>submergence</b> <b>ratio</b> increases, {{the accuracy of the}} prediction increases. The percentage of error for the high heat input or <b>submergence</b> <b>ratio</b> is within ± 10 %. Working conditions and system dimension have a direct influence to the bubble pump performance. For instance, the bubble pump experimental results show that the mass flow rate of the bubble pump increases when either the <b>submergence</b> <b>ratio</b> or the concentration of ammonia increases. However, the performance of the bubble pump drops when the tube diameter or the system pressure increases. The Einstein refrigeration system has only been rebuilt once since it invention. In order to redesign and rebuilt a practical Einstein refrigeration system, some challenges are revealed.

40|$|Interactions of free-surface {{waves and}} {{submerged}} perforated structures {{are far less}} understood than the interactions of waves and conventional impermeable structures. This motivates the present research to investigate major hydrodynamic properties of submerged perforated structures, especially horizontally submerged perforated plates. Studies carried out in present thesis are mainly {{in the framework of}} potential flow theory. However, the local detailed viscous caused flow around each single perforation on the plate influences the global wave forces on the plate. The viscous effects of plate perforations are represented by applying a quadratic pressure-loss condition. The effect of perforation on the global wave forces, as well as the resulting amplitude or the Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) number characteristic added mass and damping coefficients are examined numerically and experimentally. We show in theory that the amplitude or KC number dependent hydrodynamic coefficients come from the quadratic pressureloss condition. The quadratic pressure-loss condition relates the pressure loss between the two plate sides to the square of relative velocity between the water particle through perforation and the plate. Further, the non-dimensional flow quantities’ dependence on plate perforation ratio and KC number can be combined and expressed with one single parameter, namely the perforation-effect KC number. Numerical works are carried out in both two and three dimensions. In two-dimensional semi-analytical studies, the existence of a horizontally submerged perforated plate is represented by a vortex distribution. The quadratic pressure-loss condition is equivalently linearized on the mean plate position in the frequency domain studies. The wave excitation loads, added mass and damping coefficients when the plate is forced to heave or roll, as well as the far-field wave transmission and reflection coefficients are extensively discussed by varying the incident wave parameters and the plate lengths, <b>submergence,</b> perforation <b>ratios</b> and motion amplitudes. In addition, new experiments are performed in three dimensions to examine the added mass and damping coefficients of heaving perforated plates, as well as the free-surface effects. The same scenarios are numerically studied by a three-dimensional boundary element method (BEM) in the frequency domain. In the BEM, a cylindrical control surface is introduced, which divides the water domain into inner and outer sub-domains. On the control surface, the velocity potential is formulated analytically and is matched with the inner domain BEM. In the inner domain BEM the linear free-surface conditions, as well as the equivalent linearized pressure-loss condition on an arbitrarily shaped plate are taken into account. Further, the satisfaction of the pressure-loss condition requires the iterations of solving boundary integral equations in inner domain for both velocity potential and flow velocities on the plate. Total forces on the plate are obtained after the convergence of BEM. The plate perforation will affect the vortex shedding at the plate edges. The associated cross flow drag forces are empirically calculated by a drag term as in the Morison equation, with a reasonable modification of cross flow velocity in order to take plate perforation into account. The empirical drag forces influence both the added mass and damping coefficients. Linear free-surface effects, KC numbers, perforation <b>ratios,</b> <b>submergence,</b> as well as the sensitivity studies of empirical drag forces are discussed. Reasonable agreement between numerical results and experiments are presented. We emphasize that for the smaller KC numbers, damping effects from plate perforations play an important role. For larger KC numbers, the empirical drag forces, which depend on plate edges and free-surface effects, need to be correctly adjusted. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, a two-dimensional fully nonlinear time-domain numerical wave tank with a submerged plate is formulated without flow separation from the plate edges. Nonlinear effects from free-surface conditions, as well as the quadratic pressureloss condition on the instantaneous plate positions are examined. Numerical results are only successful for submerged solid plate cases. Wave decompositions due to small plate submergence are shown. When the plate is perforated, the quadratic pressure-loss condition is used to update the velocity potential drop between the two plate sides as an evolutionary equation. The numerical difficulties are believed to come from the singularities at the two plate ends for a non-separated flow condition. No converged results are obtained in a standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta time-stepping process and a linear BEM. Possible solutions and extensions of present work for submerged perforated plates are discussed in a time domain perspective. PhD i marin teknikkPhD in Marine Technolog...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} shape and {{relative}} <b>submergence</b> (the <b>ratio</b> of flow depth to obstacle height, d/H) were investigated on the wakes around four different low-aspect-ratio wall-mounted obstacles: semi-ellipsoids {{with the major}} axes of the base ellipses aligned in the streamwise and transverse directions, two cylinders with aspect ratios matching the ellipsoids. Wake structure of a fully submerged, spherical obstacle was also investigated in the same flow conditions to {{provide insight into the}} flow obstacle interaction with ramification to sediment transport. A low-aspect-ratio semi-ellipsoid was chosen as broad representative of a freshwater mussel projecting from a river bed, and a sphere was employed as representative of a boulder. Two cylinders were used due to their similarity to geometries investigated in other studies. Digital Particle Image Velocimetry and thermal anemometry were used to interrogate the flow. For ellipsoids and cylinders, streamwise features observed in the mean wake included counter-rotating distributions of vorticity inducing downwash (tip structures), upwash (base structures), and horseshoe vortices. In particular, the relatively subtle change in geometry produced by the rotation of the ellipsoid from the streamwise to the transverse orientation resulted in a striking modification of the mean streamwise vorticity distribution in the wake. Tip structures were dominant in the former case while base structures were dominant in the latter. A vortex skeleton model of the wake is proposed in which arch vortex structures, shed from the obstacle, are deformed by the competing mechanisms of Biot-Savart self-induction and the external shear flow. An inverse relationship was observed between the relative submergence and the strength of the base structures for the ellipsoids, with a dominant base structure observed for d/H = 1 in both cases. The wake of the sphere is more complex than ellipsoidal geometries. Streamwise features observed in the mean wake including tip, horseshoe structures, and weak upwash. The shedding characteristics and dynamics of the wake were examined. Weak symmetric shedding was observed in the wakes of streamwise and transverse ellipsoids at d/H = 3. 9 while cross-spectral measurements confirmed downstream and upstream tilting of arch structures shed by the transverse and streamwise ellipsoids, respectively. Much weaker peaks in the power spectrum were observed for low- and high-aspect-ratio cylinders. While the dominant Strouhal number remained constant as the relative submergence was reduced to d/H = 2. 5 for the ellipsoids, it increased abruptly at d/H = 1 and transitioned to an antisymmetric mode. For sphere geometry at d/H = 3. 9, a weak dominant frequency was observed close to obstacle junction and the cross-correlation function for symmetric measurements in the wake indicates symmetric shedding.

(1997); Stone and Shen (2002); Baptist et al. (2007); Huthoff et al. (2007); and Yang and Choi (2010). Each of these models is based on measurable vegetation characteristics to account for flow resistance by the vegetation.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of flow velocity distribution {{is an essential}} requirement in dealing with stage–discharge relationships, sediments transport processes and prediction of morphological behaviour in alluvial streams, design of stable channels, flood control works and mathematical and physical modelling of flows. Due to the limitations of classical hydraulic methods, Chiu (1987) derived the velocity distribution law basing {{on the concept of}} informational entropy introduced by Shannon (1948) and Tsallis (1988). Such velocity profile has been widely employed in many different flow cases and improved by relevant and meaningful both theoretical and applied contributions derived from robust experimental knowledge. Main aspect of such model is related to the need of one parameter M said as entropy parameter. Such parameter is depending on the ratio between the mean cross section velocity over maximum velocity, Φ(M). The way to evaluate the entropy parameter M through the ratio Φ(M), still represents a relevant issue nourishing a reach discussion among researchers mainly addressed to the reasonable ground about the invariance of Φ(M) for sections along the same river only at high flow while for low stage the ratio Φ(M) can be affected by the influence of roughness, through the relative <b>submergence,</b> the <b>ratio</b> between water depth and roughness height (D/d) {{as well as by the}} aspect ratio related to the cross section geometry, the ratio between flow width and flow depth (B/D). Therefore M should be assumed as a peculiar characteristic not only of the monitored site but also of the river reach where sites are located and the observed flow stage. Moving from these bases, using laboratory and field data, the classical hydraulic relationships on entropy velocity profile, the uniform flow and regime theory, a predictor for entropy parameter is proposed for open channel flow. The work proposes a general logarithmic relationship existing between the parameter Φ(M), the relative submergence and the aspect ratio of the flow. The [Φ(M) -(D/d) -(B/D) ] relationships have been applied to a set of experimental velocity data collected both in laboratory and in field, showing a good response of the theoretical model but selecting different behaviour depending on the roughness scale. In fact, Φ(M) is strongly depending on the ratio depth/roughness for values of D/d less than 4 when large and intermediate roughness scale occurs, while it might be assumed almost constant to 0. 66 for small roughness scale (D/d> 4) according to literature for high flow stage. On the other hand, the relationship among Φ(M) and B/D seems to be depending on whether or not the flow is confined, like artificial channel, instead of natural cross section. The comparison between the two set of data, laboratory versus field, enlighten the effect of the aspect ratio which is strongly related to Φ(M) for flume velocity data while it results not depending on Φ(M) for river measurements. Further, even this last issue enforce the difference between the Φ(M) ratio behaviours for high roughness flow and low roughness one, remaking the value of D/d= 4 as operative threshold...|$|R

We {{demonstrate that the}} majority of pools at our study sites are formed by flow obstructions and that pool geometry and frequency largely depend on obstruction characteristics (size, type, and frequency). However, the effectiveness of obstructions to induce scour also depends on channel characteristics, such as channel gradient, width:depth ratio, relative <b>submergence</b> (<b>ratio</b> of flow depth to grain size), and the calibre and rate of bed material supply. Moreover, different reach-scale channel types impose different characteristic physical processes and boundary conditions that further control the occurrence of pools within a catchment. Our findings indicate that effective management of pools and associated aquatic habitat requires consideration of a variety of factors, each of which may be more or less important depending on channel type and location within a catchment. Consequently, strategies for managing pools that are based solely on single-factor, regional target values (e. g. a certain number of wood pieces or pools per stream length) are likely to be ineffective because they do not account for the variety of loca...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this investigation is to study experimentally the water surface profiles and to obtain convenient expressions for the estimation of discharge coefficients (Cd) for free flow over chimney weir and the discharge factor (q/q 1) for submerged flow. Four chimney weir models with different vertex angles were constructed and tested, the surface water profiles, for all models were smooth upstream and fall suddenly downstream the model and at a high discharge it become concave while at law discharge the water surface profile become convex. The coefficient of discharge for free flow increase with the decrease of the upstream head and with the decrease of half vertex angle (T). While the discharge factor for submerged flow increase with the decrease of the <b>submergence</b> <b>ratio</b> (h 2 /h 1). Two general expressions were optioned, one, for the estimation of Cd with respect of (h/p),(w/p) and T for free flow conditions {{and the other for}} estimation of the coefficient factor (q/q 1) with respect to (h 2 /h 1) and (h 1 /p).

40|$|Posidonia oceanica meadows are {{considered}} to be of high importance to the environmental conservation in the Mediterranean Sea, supporting a highly biodiverse habitat and protecting from coastal erosion. In the CIEM wave flume of LIM/UPC (Barcelona, Spain) large scale experiments have been conducted for measuring wave attenuation, transmission and energy dissipation over artificial P. oceanica in intermediate and shallow waters. The effects of <b>submergence</b> <b>ratio</b> hs/D (hs = height of seagrass, D = water depth) and seagrass density (number of stems per squared meter) on the above characteristics are investigated. Mean velocities above and within the simulated P. oceanica are measured and the wave induced flow within the seagrass, which influences processes such as nutrient uptake, waste removal and larval dispersion, is estimated. A meadow with a total length of 10. 70 m was constructed using polypropylene artificial plants. Measurements of wave height at different locations along the meadow indicate attenuation of waves for three different submergence ratios (hs/D), two seagrass densities (stems/m 2) and various wave conditions. Results are also analysed with regard to the wave induced flow within the field and the effects of hs/D and seagrass density on mean flow characteristics are investigated based on measurements of mean velocities taken within the meadow.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of submerged flow below vertical gate with sill upstream of horizontal diverging channel reach are analyzed based on experimental investigation. The experimental program is {{conducted in a}} laboratory flume with 10 cm wide, 31 cm deep and 3. 0 m long. A diverging channel reach with fixed length and constant divergence angle is used. Polygonal sills with constant height, constant upstream slope and variable downstream slope are used under the gate. These sills are tested under wide range of similar submerged flow conditions to investigate the effect of sill slope on the flow characteristics. Also, a particular sill is tested under different heights to address the effect of sill height on the flow characteristics. Both the effects of submergence and the under-gate Froude number on the flow below the gate are discussed. Different flow regimes are considered (Supercritical, critical and subcritical flow). It is found {{that the presence of}} sill under the gate upstream of diverging channel reach has a remarkable effect on the discharge coefficient of the gate. It is noticed that the <b>submergence</b> <b>ratio</b> and the upstream head ratio are not able to explain the observed variations (or scatter of data) in the discharge coefficients. These variations or scatters are completely explained by the under-gate Froude number and the differential head ratio. ...|$|E

Relationships such as the Manning, Chézy and Darcy-Weisbach equations have been in use for a century or more. All of them account for resistance with a single coefficient of resistance, and the central problem is evaluation of this coefficient. Experimental results by different researchers have shown that Manning’s n varies strongly with the ratio of flow depth to roughness height. It is constant for values of this ratio above about 4, but increases significantly for lower values. This suggests that the equation is not suitable in its original form for the case of intermediate-scale roughness. The roughness is intermediate-scale if the relative <b>submergence</b> <b>ratio</b> of flow depth to roughness elements height lies between 1 and 4. The influence of the roughness elements on flow resistance in this regime {{is caused by a}} combination of both element drag and boundary shear, or friction. The results of an experimental study with hemispherical roughness elements are presented, showing how the roughness element size, spacing and pattern influence flow resistance.
