A transmission fluid warmer was added, reducing warm-up time, and lower viscosity CVT fluid improves efficiency. Its new fluid pump reduces parasitic loss at high speeds. The transmission's software creates discrete sequential shift points to emulate traditional transmissions while accelerating. The <b>S</b> <b>trim</b> offers a manual-mode shift gate in the console shifter, or paddle shifters on the steering wheel allowing sequential [...] "shifts" [...] through 7 speeds, addressing complaints that earlier pulley-type CVTs had a [...] "rubber band" [...] feel when accelerating because of the lag as the transmission entered its power band.|$|R
