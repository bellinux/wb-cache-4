500|$|Mace {{was seen}} as a strong yet very {{feminine}} female character, as she often rescues Lenny in dire situations and shows maternal concern for him. Both characters represent a significant contrast: Mace is the film's hero and moral center, whereas Lenny is the antihero; Mace is black and Lenny is white; and finally, Mace represents the [...] "hard-edged, reality-based" [...] component, while Lenny is dominated by fantasies. This is especially notable when Mace yells to him, [...] "This is your life! Right here! Right now! It's real time, you hear me? Real time, time to get real, not playback!" [...] The film's white characters also tend to be nihilistically concerned with the present, while black characters are generally future revolutionaries.

500|$|On the film's initial release, the French critics' general {{response}} was moderate, ranging from mild enthusiasm to general disdain or disappointment, claiming {{it to be}} either a repetition of German expressionism or simply a disappointment of the director's leap from documentary filmmaker to a genre film-maker claiming the film {{to be in a}} [...] "minor genre, quite unworthy of his abilities". Franju responded to these comments claiming the film was his attempt to get the minor genre to be taken seriously. In England, Isabel Quigly, film critic for The Spectator, called it [...] "the sickest film <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> film criticism", while a reviewer who admitted that she liked the film was nearly fired. A review in Variety was negative, noting specifically that the [...] "stilted acting, asides to explain characters and motivations, and a repetition of effects lose the initial impact" [...] and an [...] "unclear progression and plodding direction give [...] an old-fashioned air". The Monthly Film Bulletin opined that [...] "when a director as distinguished as Georges Franju makes a horror film...one cannot but feel tempted to search for symbols, an allegory, layers, or interpretation. Unhappily there is practically nothing in this inept work to offer any encouragement for doing so." [...] The review noted [...] "a strange and poetic opening" [...] and that Schuftan's [...] "haunting camerawork allies itself perfectly to Maurice Jarre's obsessive score" [...] while" [...] Brasseur and Valli were [...] "sadly wasted" [...] and that they [...] "do what they can with almost non-existent characters" ...|$|E
500|$|Wisden viewed Hutton, with Jack Hobbs, as [...] "one of the {{two most}} {{accomplished}} professional batsmen to have played for his country", and following the Second World War, critics regarded him as the best batsman in the world. In October 2010, he was chosen as part of the ESPNCricinfo All-time World XI, a team selected by a panel of respected commentators and cricket writers to represent the greatest cricketers of all time. As part of the same process, he was also chosen in England's greatest team. The official Yorkshire history describes him as [...] "technically and aesthetically the best batsman to play for Yorkshire". E. W. Swanton believed that if Hobbs was the greatest professional batsman, Hutton, along with Hammond and Compton, came next. Hutton was more cautious than these others. Following the lead of Herbert Sutcliffe, he saw the role of an opening batsman as defensive. The basis of his game was a good defensive technique, although he was able to accelerate and play attacking shots when the situation demanded. Cricket historian David Frith believes that [...] "there was an apparent touch of genius about his batsmanship", and Alan Gibson described Hutton's off drive as [...] "the glory of the game." [...] He was particularly effective on difficult batting pitches. Of the next generation of England batsmen, Peter May tried to adopt Hutton's mental approach to both batting and captaincy, while Colin Cowdrey later said [...] "I had tried to model myself on Len Hutton ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> playing serious cricket." [...] Statistically, Hutton stands near the highest achievers. When he retired, only two men had scored more than his 6,971 Test runs; his average of 56.67 is seventh highest of those who played at least fifty Test matches, as of 2016, while only Sutcliffe has a higher average among openers who scored over 4,000 runs. He also displayed consistency; his annual average only fell below 50 three times, he averaged over 50 each year from 1947 to 1954 and scored 20 or more in 90 of his 138 innings.|$|E
