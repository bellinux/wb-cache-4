50|$|On 1 December 1978 the Health and Safety Executive {{announced}} {{their intention to}} prosecute the university for breach of safety legislation. The case was heard in November 1979. Expert evidence, presented by the defence and accepted by the magistrates, showed that sufficient virus material could not be produced by the laboratory to generate an infectious dose in the telephone room where Parker was supposedly infected. Although the source of infection was traced, the mode of transmission was not. The defence witnesses claimed that 11,812 gallons of virus suspension would have been required to generate an infectious dose in the telephone room. Although the Shooter Inquiry noted the poor state <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>ducting</b> in the laboratory, this was caused after the outbreak by engineers fumigating the laboratory and ducts. The university {{was found not guilty}} of causing Parker's death. In August 1981, following a formal claim for damages made by the trade union Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs in 1979, Parker's husband, Joseph, was awarded £25,000 in compensation.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{efficacy}} <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> bile <b>ducts</b> by determining the adhesive strength <b>of</b> 2 different <b>sealing</b> agents, i. e. a fibrinogen-coated collagen patch (TachoSil (R)) and a liquid fibrin sealant (Tissucol (R)), in an experimental partial liver resection model in pigs. Methods: Pigs underwent laparotomy and partial resection of the left medial liver lobe. A 16 -Ch silicon catheter was introduced into the common bile duct. Pigs were randomly assigned to 2 groups (n = 4 each). In group 1, TachoSil was applied on the resection surface, and in group 2 Tissucol was applied. After 2 h, pressure in the intrabiliary system was gradually increased. Results: No significant differences in the hemostasis times between TachoSil and Tissucol were observed (210. 0 +/- 12. 9 vs. 208. 8 +/- 14. 2 s; p = 0. 9506). The pressure that could be resisted with Tissucol was significantly lower compared to TachoSil (77. 0 +/- 8. 6 vs. 131. 8 +/- 16. 3 mm Hg; p = 0. 0405). Conclusions: The application of TachoSil on the resection surface is equally effective in obtaining hemostasis and in <b>sealing</b> <b>of</b> biliary <b>ducts</b> as Tissucol. The adhesive strength of TachoSil on the resection surface, however, is superior to Tissucol. Copyright (C) 2008 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|R
40|$|The {{presentation}} {{addresses the}} alternative assembly of power semiconductors (IGBTs and diodes) with direct liquid cooling {{from the top}} and bottom side. The technology extends the current carrying capability of semiconductors significantly by reducing the thermal resistance between semiconductors and cooling liquid. Especially in the case of converters employed for propulsion in cars, the innovation will reduce the system cost and increase assembly lifetime. Particular challenges in this type of assembly are thermal-mechanical reliability, the low thermal resistance and the difficulty of designing the required production processes. High-voltage resistance, power supply and the <b>sealing</b> <b>of</b> cooling <b>ducts</b> have to be solved as well. Investigations include today's problems with conventionally soldered and heavy wire bonded power modules as well as some alternative assembly possibilities which are currently under discussion or being tested, respectively. The concept of contacting semiconductors between two substrates (e. g. DCBs) with cooling from both sides will be discussed in detail. The demonstrator shown in this presentation is used to establish the technology's viability and its estimated characteristics, particularly in terms of lifetime. It comprises a half bridge with two IGBTs and diodes, which are soldered onto DCBs on both sides. Through the additional thermal dissipation on the upper surface, static thermal resistance is reduced by 40 % compared to one-sided cooling assemblies. Dynamic thermal resistance is also significantly reduced through the thermal mass of the second DCB. The main challenges of contacting semiconductors quality-like between two substrates with top and bottom cooling liquid are the availability of semiconductors for soldering or sintering from both sides with optimized pad layout, adjusted DCB layout as well as encapsulation technologies to achieve appropriate insulation capability, the assembly technology and the <b>sealing</b> <b>of</b> cooling <b>ducts.</b> Reliability topics are the fatigue/creep behavior of the semiconductor to substrate contacts, the mechanical stability of the DCBs and thermo-mechanical mismatch between the applied materials. A prototype is introduced and measurement results concerning thermal resistance, quality of assembly and life-time are presented...|$|R
40|$|Duct leakage {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major source of energy loss in residential buildings. Most duct leakage occurs at the connections to registers, plenums or branches in the duct system. At each of these connections a method <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> the <b>duct</b> system is required.

40|$|Modifications {{to local}} and state codes are seen as an {{appropriate}} strategy {{for the prevention of}} residential air distribution system leakage and its impacts. A model code element has been developed to assist this strategy. Recent field studies of Florida residences by Cummings, Tooley and Moyer have revealed a mean leakage of 11 percent for the air distribution systems of central, fan-force heating and air conditioning systems. Such leakage may cause an estimated 20 percent increase in energy consumption for air conditioning, as well as a 50 percent increase in peak cooling load and an 80 percent increase in peak heating load. In addition, building air leakage may be expected to be several times greater when duct leakage is present or when avenues of air egress from closeable rooms are absent. The model duct construction element presented here contains all of the standards, definitions and code language needed to replace the current <b>duct</b> construction element <b>of</b> the local or state code. The content of this paper was used as a principal source for language adopted for the 1991 Florida Energy Efficiency Code For Building Construction. Addressed are the most appropriate standards required for the closure and <b>sealing</b> <b>of</b> metal <b>duct,</b> rigid fibrous glass duct, and nonmetallic flexible duct. Also addressed are (1) detailed requirements for the <b>sealing</b> <b>of</b> mechanical closets when they function as plenum chambers, (2) detailed requirements for the <b>sealing</b> <b>of</b> enclosed support platforms or air handlers and furnaces when they function as return duct, (3) detailed requirements for the <b>sealing</b> <b>of</b> uninhabitable cavities of the building structure, when they function as duct, and (4) detailed requirements for the egress of air from enclosed rooms which receive supply air. Where necessary, commentary is provided to explain the options available for implementing the model code provision as well as its ramifications. All provisions of this model code are compatible with the requirements, standards and guidelines contained in related documents published by the following organizations: the Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc., the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors National Association, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air conditioning Engineers, Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., the Air Conditioning Contractors Of America, the Thermal Insulation Manufacturers Association, the National Fire Protection Association, and the Gypsum Association...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{field measurements}} from five apartments in New York that were monitored {{to determine the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>duct</b> retrofits on energy use. Energy losses from forced air distribution systems {{have a significant impact on}} the energy efficiency of buildings. Little work has been done to quantify these losses in apartment buildings. In this paper we will discuss field measurements made on four forced air heating systems to evaluate the duct system energy losses to unconditioned basements. The apartments were heated by natural gas furnaces located in the basements. The systems had bare sheet metal ductwork exposed to the basement conditions. The pre-retrofit measurements were made on the systems after sealing large easily visible leaks. The post-retrofit measurements were made after wrapping the ducts in foil backed glass fiber insulation and additional leak sealing. Only the sections <b>of</b> <b>duct</b> exposed to the basement were retrofitted because only these sections were accessible. This study examines the potential energy savings for this type of limited retrofit. The energy losses were separated into leakage and conduction terms. Leakage measurements were made using register flowhood techniques. Conduction losses were estimated by measuring temperatures in the plenums and at the registers. Analysis of the measurements has shown typical reduction in leakage flow due to <b>duct</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>of</b> about 40 %.
