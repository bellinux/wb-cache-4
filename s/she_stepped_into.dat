25|$|In 1979, Florance {{appeared}} as May Swaisey—an elderly farm owner {{and friend of}} protagonist Max—in George Miller's hugely successful dystopian action film Mad Max.

She was back on set {{a few days later}} to finish her scenes with her leg and hip in plaster.|$|E
500|$|On February 7, 2017, Republicans in the Senate voted that Sen. Warren had {{violated}} Senate rule 19 {{during the debate}} on attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, claiming that she impugned his character when she quoted statements made about Sessions by Coretta Scott King and Sen. Ted Kennedy. [...] "Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill {{the free exercise of}} the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to happen," [...] King wrote in a 1986 letter to Sen. Strom Thurmond, which Warren attempted to read on the Senate floor. This action prohibited Warren from further participating in the debate on Sessions' nomination for United States Attorney General. Instead, <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> a nearby room and continued reading King's letter while streaming live on the Internet.|$|E

60|$|And {{without another}} word of protest <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> boldly <b>into</b> the room.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> back <b>into</b> {{the house}} and the door closed behind her.|$|R
60|$|After that <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the sledge, closely {{followed}} by Maria.|$|E
60|$|She {{gave the}} chauffeur a whispered order as <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the car.|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} he was with her again, and <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the wet punt.|$|E
50|$|After the {{culmination}} of the wedding ceremony, the bride is formally taken to the groom’s house. This is called Gr̥hapravēśam of the bride. As <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> her new home, she is welcomed by the groom’s family members, including his mother and closest relatives.|$|R
5|$|Emily frees Victor of his vow {{to marry}} her, giving the wedding ring back to Victor and her wedding bouquet to Victoria before exiting the church.

50|$|Between the 1930s and {{her death}} in 1983, <b>she</b> rarely <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the spotlight.|$|R
60|$|With that, <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the chaise, and, {{taking the}} reins herself, drove off to Frizinghall.|$|E
60|$|She walked {{towards the}} door with him. His own little night-brougham was waiting there, and <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> it.|$|E
60|$|And then <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the water, {{brought the}} boat in close with her crutch, and lifted little Gerda out.|$|E
60|$|She made no reply, {{only she}} shivered {{a little as}} <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> back <b>into</b> the sunshine.|$|R
50|$|Emily frees Victor of his vow {{to marry}} her, giving the wedding ring back to Victor and her wedding bouquet to Victoria before exiting the church.

50|$|Harrison surprises Maggie at {{the airline}} {{check-in}} desk {{to see her}} off. He asks if the documents showed up, but they have not. As he is walking away, Parker's wife (Kathleen Maguire) delivers the documents to Maggie as <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> the mobile lounge. She looks them over and realizes that Harrison lied to her.|$|R
60|$|Something of her mistress's {{agitation}} {{seemed to}} have become communicated to Lenora. Her voice shook a little as <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the elevator.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, Miss Swancourt! I am {{so glad to}} find you. I {{was looking}} for you,' said a voice at her elbow--Stephen's voice. <b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the passage.|$|E
6000|$|But {{when they}} to the church-yard came, [...] I've heard poor Mary say, [...] As soon as <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the sun, [...] Her heart it died away.|$|E

60|$|So saying, <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> lightly <b>into</b> {{the snow}} and advanced, while her {{companion}} stood looking {{at her with a}} half-amused, half-anxious smile.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> {{her little}} room, {{throwing}} off her cloak as she entered. Then she stopped short, almost upon the threshold. The prince {{had risen to}} his feet.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the carriage, and {{the soft}} folds of her gown spread {{themselves}} out over the cushions. She drew them on one side {{to make room for}} him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> {{the darkened}} room, {{and closed the}} door behind her. Domiloff, who was looking white and scared, turned the key in the lock and faced her nervously.|$|E
6000|$|She {{walked to}} the door. The astounded Colonel {{nevertheless}} gallantly accompanied her as <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> out <b>into</b> the street and called shrilly, [...] "You Zaidee!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{door opened}} and the tall dark figure of Lady Harman {{stood for a moment}} in the doorway before <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> down <b>into</b> the room.|$|R

60|$|It {{was very}} cold {{when they got}} to Folkestone, and Lady Alexandrina shivered as <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the private-looking {{carriage}} which had been sent to the station for her use.|$|E
60|$|With these words, {{clasping}} tightly {{the precious}} little bundle under her arm, <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the carriage. Heedless {{of the risk}} he ran, sheer admiration sent Stephen to the carriage door.|$|E
60|$|So <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the cave, and {{sat down}} on the {{withered}} leaves by the dog-headed woman's side. In all the world, since her daughter's loss, she had found no other companion.|$|E
5000|$|Carrie finally {{makes it}} home; still wearing her blood-covered prom dress, <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> {{a bath and}} washes herself. She then snaps back to herself; she doesn't {{remember}} a thing about what happened. Her mother calls her a witch and attempts to drown her in the tub while reciting the [...] "Now I lay me down to sleep" [...] prayer.

6000|$|... "Mr Cradell, I {{wonder at}} you. And, Mr Eames, I wonder at you, too,--in your position! Lupex, come upstairs at once." [...] <b>She</b> then <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> {{the room and}} secured the gin-bottle.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} slight variations. Sometimes the {{assistant}} carries {{a string of}} inflated balloons when he or <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> the cabinet. These are burst as the spikes descend to give an added audible dimension to the illusion. Another description has a small door opened to show the assistant alive when the spikes are {{at the bottom of}} the cabinet; the small door is then closed again and the spikes lifted to the top before the assistant is finally fully revealed.|$|R
