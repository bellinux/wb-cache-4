However, some users have managed to get it working using compatibility options in Microsoft's Windows Vista. The BBC emphasises that it [...] "has a commitment to platform neutrality and a remit to make its content as widely available as possible", and that while the initial trial used a Microsoft-based technology, they are constantly looking for new technologies which {{would enable them to}} relax the restriction: Ashley Highfield, then BBC's director of Future Media and Technology, explained that [...] "we have always started with the platform that reaches the most number of people and then rolled it out from there". They also point out that not all of the content delivered through the iPlayer will be subject to DRM – live <b>streaming</b> <b>content,</b> for instance, may not need the same level of control, presumably implying that players for OS X and Linux systems could be developed with a restricted range of content. However, a project was started to enable the iPlayer to work with other platforms via the Wine project. Streaming via the BBC iPlayer website is now available in all browsers supporting Adobe Flash. Also, iPlayer Desktop, which allows downloading programmes for later offline viewing, is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.|$|E
