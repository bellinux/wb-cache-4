At the terminal at Vienna International Airport he attempted to flee, but was quickly detained by Norwegian and Austrian police. This caused the airline to deny to take him on the flight and separate aircraft had to be chartered. He was immediately detained by Lebanese police when he arrived there. In December 1997 Abdullah claimed that he had made up the defection plan and that he was acting under orders of PFLP to crash the aircraft into Oslo as a protest against the Oslo Accords and the thriving peace process.

40|$|Abstract—A multiagent {{system can}} be {{considered}} survivable if it adapts itself to varying stresses without considerable performance degradation. Such an adaptivity comprises of identifying {{the behavior of the}} agents in a society, relating them to <b>stress</b> <b>situations,</b> and then invoking control rules.

In this paper, we study a supply chain planning system implemented in COUGAAR (Cognitive Agent Architecture) and develop a methodology for identifying the behavior of agents through their behavioral parameters, and relating those parameters to <b>stress</b> <b>situations.</b> One important aspect of our approach is that we identify the <b>stress</b> <b>situations</b> of agents in the society by observing local behavior of one representative agent.

40|$|AbstractThe {{size and}} {{morphology}} of organs are largely {{determined by a}} genetic program. However in some cases, an epigenetic mechanism influences the process of organ development. Particularly, epigenetic factors such as hemodynamic stress and blood pressure affect the morphogenesis of cardiac chambers and valves. Here, we report that the epigenetic influences affect the cardiomyocyte production. Taking advantage of longer developmental period of medaka fish, we could examine the later emerging tissue responses to the defect of ventricular beating, which occurred in the hozuki (hoz) mutant that harbors the mutated ventricular myosin heavy chain (vmhc) gene. The mutant showed a remarkable ventricular enlargement, and we showed that this enlargement was due to an excess production of ventricular cardiomyocytes {{in addition to the}} lack of concentric chamber growth. By experimental blockade of blood flow, we demonstrated that an elevated cardiac pressure was responsible for the aberrant cardiomyocyte production. From these data, we propose that the epigenetic tissue response to a <b>stressed</b> <b>situation</b> controls the production of cardiomyocytes to attain a fine tuning of heart formation...|$|E
40|$|In most {{graphical}} user interfaces, {{a substantial}} part of the user's interaction involves targeting screen objects with the mouse cursor. Targeting tasks with small targets are visually demanding, and can cause users difficulty in some circumstances. These circumstances can arise either if the user has a visual disability or if factors such as fatigue or glare diminish visual acuity. One way of reducing the sensory demands of targeting is to add redundant feedback to the interface that indicates when the user has successfully acquired a target. Under optimal viewing conditions, such feedback has not significantly improved targeting performance. However, we hypothesized that targeting feedback would be more beneficial in a visually <b>stressed</b> <b>situation.</b> We carried out an experiment in which normally sighted participants in a reduced-acuity environment carried out targeting tasks with a mouse. We found that people were able to select targets significantly faster when they were given targeting feedback, and that they made significantly fewer errors. People also greatly preferred interfaces with feedback to those with none. The results suggest that redundant targeting feedback can improve the usability of graphical interfaces, both for low-vision users and also for normally sighted users in visually stressed environments. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Recent {{development}} has witnessed blackout incidents {{in many parts}} of the world. This can be due to voltage instability phenomena resulted from the <b>stressed</b> <b>situation</b> of the system where large amounts of real and reactive power are transported over long transmission lines. Besides, electric power systems are also exposed to various contingencies which contribute to over-loading of network branches, unsatisfactory voltages, leading to voltage collapse problems. Appropriate precaution can be made if the areas prone to voltage instability are clustered making a continuous monitoring is possible. This paper presents the weak area clustering technique based on sensitive lines and critical line outages in power system network. A new algorithm to automatically perform the line outage contingency analysis and ranking was developed. This technique results in critical line outages in the system. Subsequently, voltage stability analysis which confines the repetitive load flow and voltage stability indices computation revealed the sensitive lines in the system. Outcomes from both techniques will eventually cluster the weak area in the system, representing the resultant cluster deduced from each one. Implementation on the IEEE RTS revealed the effectiveness of the proposed technique, making it feasible to be implemented in a practical system which in turn helping in proper monitoring process to the specified cluster. Key-Words- Weak area clustering, voltage stability, contingency, sensitive line clusters, critical line outage cluster, clusters similarity. ...|$|E

In 1992 and 1993, another two trials were carried out with 12. 5, 25 and 50 plants per m" 2 and two sprinkler irrigation levels (at pF 2. 3 and pF 2. 7, in 1992 and pF 2. 3 and pF 2. 9, in 1993). The pods were harvested at various ripening stages. As plant population increases pod yield increases too. Plant population between 25 and 50 plants per m" 2 is recommended. Pod quality is not to much affected by plant population. Irrigation rate is more important than quantity. Small and frequent amounts of water applied at flowering and pod formation are preferable. The pods of water unstressed plants have lower sieve size, less developed seeds and less fiberness. Green beans plants have water stress adaptation mechanisms, once in a <b>stressed</b> <b>situation,</b> plant recovers rapidly its turgidity, when more water is available. the growing cycle duration should be about 60 days (after sowing). as the growing cycle is enlarged, pod yield increases, but pod quality decreases, so the exact harvest date should be determined with accuracy and based on pod maturity.
