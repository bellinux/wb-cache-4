5000|$|In 2006 Navarro {{began working}} {{regularly}} {{on the main}} Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) shows, adopting a new ring persona; A masked personal called Mictlán, based on the myhtis of the Aztec Underworld. Over {{the next two years}} Mictlán worked in the first or second matches on the show without direction until he started a storyline feud with Dragón Rojo, Jr.. The storyline between the two build to a Luchas de Apuesta between the two masked men. On August 8, 2009 Mictlán lost to Dragón Rojo, Jr. and was unmasked. Following the mask loss CMLL has promoted Mictlán a bit higher in the rankings, giving him more of a metrosexual, <b>stripper</b> <b>ring</b> persona. Following his unmasking Mictlán won the hair of Loco Max on December 12, 2008 in a Luchas de Apuestas match. On August 18, 2009 Mictlán defeated Misterioso, Jr. to win the Occidente (Western) Light Heavyweight Championship, overcoming both his opponent and interference from Máscara Mágica, Misterioso, Jr's cornerman. After the match Mictlán revealed that he was wrestling with an injured elbow but did not let that stop him from competing. He also made a Luchas de Apuestas challenge for a [...] "hair vs. hair" [...] match with Máscara Mágica. In the weeks after Mictlán's title victory Máscara Mágica repeatedly attacked Mictlán before matches, claiming that he [...] "did not want to see Mictlán dance". Máscara Mágica pinned Mictlán in several tag and six-man matches leading up to their Lucha de Apuesta on September 17, 2009 at Arena Coliseo in Guadalajara. Mictlán won the first fall after Máscara Magica was disqualified for excessive violence. Mágica won the second fall but Mictlán picked up the third fall to win the match. Afterwards Máscara Mágica took the clippers from the official and shaved his own hair off.|$|E
40|$|The {{superficial}} femoral arteries {{of recently}} deceased patients with severe peripheral arteriosclerosis were thrombendarterectomized. Two different methods were compared, a closed with an oscillating <b>ring</b> <b>stripper</b> (Amsco Hall Arterial Oscillator) and an open, the traditional, originating from dos Santos. Care {{was taken to}} avoid postmortem changes of significance for the study. The efficacy of the former method was evaluated {{in relation to the}} traditional open endarterectomy. The two methods seem to give the same result in terms of dis-section planes and reopened collateral orifices. The authors consider that the oscillating <b>ring</b> <b>stripper</b> method has obvious advantage over the open method and seems to be a good alternative to synthetic by-pass when the saphenous vein is unaviable...|$|R
40|$|Objectives:technical {{success and}} early outcome of {{modified}} surgical techniques integrating interventional procedures for iliac recanalisation performed through an incision in the groin. Materials:sixty-one consecutive iliac arteries in 59 patients with long occlusions in 16, occlusions {{of the common}} iliac in 11, occlusions of the external iliac in 24 and multiple stenoses of the iliac in 10 cases underwent semiclosed recanalisation through a groin incision. Methods:passage of the lesion by guidewire permits retrograde ring-stripper endarterectomy over the wire as a guiding splint or thrombectomy with a double lumen balloon catheter. Residual lesions are corrected by balloon or stent angioplasty. Adequate outflow is established by femoral patch plasty. Results:conversion to a standard operation was required in 10 limbs (failure to recanalise the lesion in nine, rupture after angioplasty in one). Initial technical success was achieved in the remaining 51 limbs (recanalisation by <b>ring</b> <b>stripper</b> endarterectomy in 36, thrombectomy in 14, both in six, additional intraoperative angioplasty in 42). Five postoperative thromboses were successfully treated by a combined surgical and interventional approach accounting for a 1 -month 100 % secondary patency. Conclusion:iliac recanalisation through the groin by modified <b>ring</b> <b>stripper</b> endarterectomy or modified thrombectomy in combination with intraoperative angioplasty is a safe and effective procedure. Long-term results are required to evaluate the procedure...|$|R
5000|$|LA Weekly [...] "Reading Pick of the Week" [...] "Every detail, {{down to a}} <b>stripper's</b> {{multiple}} piercings, <b>rings</b> true. Though not autographical per se, the novel, in part, parallels Lindquist's own life. Lindquist gained admittance to {{the literary}} Brat Pack, which included Jay McInerney and Bret Easton Ellis, with his first novel, Sad Movies, (1987). But {{after the publication of}} a second novel, Carnival Desires, Lindquist put his writing on hold to attend law school, and became a deputy prosecutor in the Pierce County Special Assault Unit. His first-hand knowledge of legal procedure as well as the Seattle rock scene, and his sense of irony combined with an ability to nail a character's quirks make Never Mind Nirvana laugh-aloud hilarious. In addition, the reading will be a homecoming of sorts: Lindquist spent much of the mid-'80s in Los Angeles as a screenwriter, alternately hobnobbing with the movie-biz elite (including then-love interest and ex-movie Brat Packer, Molly Ringwald) and slumming around the underground Hollywood rock scene (he was a fixture at L7 gigs and after-hours haunts like the Zero One). At readings, Lindquist's delivery is deadpan and witty." [...] (Pleasant Gehman, LA Weekly) ...|$|R
