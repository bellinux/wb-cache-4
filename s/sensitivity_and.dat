Phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser23/Ser24 under adrenergic stimulation enhances relaxation of cardiac muscle, which is critical to cardiac function especially at fast heart rate. Whereas PKA phosphorylation of Ser23/Ser24 decreases myofilament Ca2+ <b>sensitivity</b> <b>and</b> increases relaxation, phosphorylation of Ser42/Ser44 by PKC increases Ca2+ <b>sensitivity</b> <b>and</b> decreases cardiac muscle relaxation.

Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm.

Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced <b>sensitivity,</b> <b>and</b> these can be modified to accommodate disabilities.
