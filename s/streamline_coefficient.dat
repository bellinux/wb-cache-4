The class of supercritical flows is considered, in which the gas velocities in the jet downstream from the throat are supersonic. The subsonic region of the flowfield is solved in the hodograph plane by a finite-difference method. The supersonic region is solved in the physical plane by the method of characteristics. The stream function distribution on the sonic line is adjusted iteratively to match the boundary conditions at the lip and free <b>streamline.</b> Discharge <b>coefficients</b> are evaluated and truncation errors in the results are considered. ...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{studies the}} {{separated}} flow {{in a square}} channel with ribs on one wall by using the PIV method. In this study, the spacing between ribs is kept constant and the heights of rib are varied in order to investigate {{the influence of the}} pitch-to-height ratio, P/e on the flow structures. Depending on the various pitch ratios, the enclosure between ribs can be regarded as closed or open cavity. Results are included for mean velocity, <b>streamlines,</b> skin-friction <b>coefficient,</b> anisotropy parameter, turbulent kinetic energy production and two-point correlation. It is found that the separated shear layer in the closed cavity has strong momentum exchange with the mainstream. By contrast, the fluid contained in the open cavity is self-sustained and the outside streamlines are almost parallel to the bottom wall. Moreover, for the open cavity, the velocity fluctuations become vigorous as the flow reattaches directly on the trailing edge. Copyrigh...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the flows in unshrouded and shrouded inducers which are known to be highly complex, three dimensional flows with real fluid effects. A flow visualization technique using tufts and paint dots was used to study the flows on the blade, hub and housing at off-design flows. It was found that the blade boundary layer flows were attached to the blade surface and that leakage flows were the cause of the upstream swirling backflow in unshrouded inducers. It was also found that shrouded inducers showed flow reversal near the leading edge in addition to the discharge-to-suction leakage flow. The observations provide {{a better understanding of the}} internal flows and the occurrence of upstream backflows.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a {{numerical}} simulation based on Kω-SST turbulence {{model has been}} carried out to determine the tandem propeller hydrodynamic characteristics in non-cavitating viscous flow by using the commercial code Fluent. As the first step, the numerical approach has been applied to the case of single propeller and the comparison with experiment results was in a good agreement. Next, the effects of axial and angular displacement as well as the diameter ratio between the tandem propellers have been investigated. This part of the study reveals that the tandem with idem propeller diameters is strongly recommended to assure more advantages. Furthermore, the tandem geometry corresponding to the axial displacement equal to 0. 6 D seems to be the best configuration and the open water performances remain almost unchanged with the variation of angular displacement. On the other hand, details of the mutual interaction between tandem propellers were also given by showing pressure contours, <b>streamlines</b> and thrust <b>coefficient.</b> Globally, this study illustrates the advantages of replacing single propellers by tandem solution...|$|R
40|$|Large-eddy {{simulation}} (LES) {{is compared}} with experiment and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), and LES {{is shown to}} be superior to RANS in reproducing corner separation in the LMFA-NACA 65 linear compressor cascade, in terms of surface limiting <b>streamlines,</b> blade pressure <b>coefficient,</b> total pressure losses and blade suction side boundary layer profiles. However, LES is too expensive to conduct an influencing parameter study of the corner separation. RANS approach, despite over-predicting the corner separation, gives reasonable descriptions of the corner separated flow, and is thus selected to conduct a parametric study in this paper. Two kinds of influencing parameters on corner separation, numerical and physical parameters, are analyzed and discussed: second order spatial scheme is necessary for a RANS simulation; incidence angle and inflow boundary layer thickness are found to show the most significant influences on the corner separation among the parameters studied; unsteady RANS with the imposed inflow unsteadiness (inflow angle varying sinusoidally with fluctuating amplitude of 0. 92 °) does not show any non-linear effect on the corner separation...|$|R
40|$|Micro scale gas flows has {{attracted}} significant research {{interest in the}} last two decades. In this research, the fluid flow of gases in the stepped micro-channel at a wide range of Knudsen number has been analyzed with using the Lattice Boltzmann (MRT) method. In the model, a modified second-order slip boundary condition and a Bosanquet-type effective viscosity are used to consider the velocity slip at the boundaries and to cover the slip and transition regimes of flow and to gain an accurate simulation of rarefied gases. It includes the slip and transition regimes of flow. The flow specifications such as pressure loss, velocity profile, <b>streamline</b> and friction <b>coefficient</b> at different conditions have been presented. The results show good agreement with available experimental data. The calculation shows that the friction coefficient decreases with increasing the Knudsen number and stepping the micro-channel has an inverse effect on the friction coefficient. Furthermore, a new correlation is suggested for calculation of the friction coefficient in the stepped micro-channel as below: C_f Re  = 3. 113 + 2. 915 /(1 + 2 Kn) + 0. 641 exp⁡(3. 203 /(1 + 2 Kn) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{discover}} the characteristic of separated flows and mechanism of plasma flow control on a highly loaded compressor cascade, numerical investigation is conducted. The simulation method is validated by oil flow visualization and pressure distribution. The loss <b>coefficients,</b> <b>streamline</b> patterns, and topology structure {{as well as}} vortex structure are analyzed. Results show that the numbers of singular points increase and three pairs of additional singular points of topology structure on solid surface generate {{with the increase of}} angle of attack, and the total pressure loss increases greatly. There are several principal vortices inside the cascade passage. The pressure side leg of horse-shoe vortex coexists within a specific region together with passage vortex, but finally merges into the latter. Corner vortex exists independently and does not evolve from the suction side leg of horse-shoe vortex. One pair of radial coupling-vortex exists near blade trailing edge and becomes the main part of backflow on the suction surface. Passage vortex interacts with the concentrated shedding vortex and they evolve into a large-scale vortex rotating in the direction opposite to passage vortex. The singular points and separation lines represent the basic separation feature of cascade passage. Plasma actuation has better effect at low freestream velocity, and the relative reductions of pitch-averaged total pressure loss coefficient with different actuation layouts of five and two pairs of electrodes are up to 30. 8 % and 26. 7 % while the angle of attack is 2 °. Plasma actuation changes the local topology structure, but does not change the number relation of singular points. One pair of additional singular point of topology structure generates with plasma actuation and one more reattachment line appears, both of which break the separation line on the suction surface...|$|R
