40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} {{has been}} attracting attention as {{a technology that}} is capable of replacing or supplementing a battery with the development of various mobile electronics. In environments where stable electrical supply is not possible, energy harvesting technology can guarantee an increased leisure and safety for human beings. Harvesting with several watts of power is essential for directly driving or efficiently charging mobile electronic devices such as laptops or cell phones. In this study, we reviewed energy harvesting technologies that harvest biomechanical energy from human motion such as foot <b>strike,</b> <b>joint</b> motion, and upper limb motion. They are classified based on the typical principle of kinetic energy harvesting: piezoelectric, triboelectric, and electromagnetic energy harvesting. We focused on the wearing position of high-power wearable biomechanical energy harvesters (WBEHs) generating watt-level power. In addition, the features and future trends of the watt-level WBEHs are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Syn-sedimentary, sub-seismic scale extensional faults in poorly lithified Pliocene {{sandstones}} {{are well}} exposed {{in an abandoned}} quarry SW of the Tarquinia village (Central Italy). Geometry and spatial distribution of main normal fault segments, and related deformational features (including secondary synthetic and antithetic faults, fault rocks, joints, deformation bands) were carefully mapped in detail both along and across major fault strikes. Fault segments are 20 - 30 m long and strike mainly NW-SE. They are partially overlapped and connected by either relay ramps or transfer faults. Kinematic analyses on fault slickensides indicate nearly pure dip-slip sense of movement. Estimated displacements (throws) never exceed 15 m. Fault damage zones are 5 - 10 m wide and consist of subsidiary synthetic and antithetic normal faults, extensional fractures and deformation bands. Their relative abundance and distribution is strongly controlled by the position within the fault zones. Subsidiary faults and deformation bands accommodate most of the total deformation in approaching the fault tips. On the other hand, indurated master slip surfaces accommodate most displacement in the central sectors of the fault zones. Near vertical, 5 - 10 cm spaced joints are frequent in their footwall damage zones. Cumulative statistical analysis of joint data indicates that they are systematically orthogonal to the fault <b>strike.</b> <b>Joint</b> paralleling the fault strike are strongly subordinated. Detailed AMS analyses were also {{carried out in the}} proper rock types along transects perpendicular to fault strikes. Results show that K 1 orientations are consistent with the stretching directions inferred from structural data. Magnetic fabrics appear reworked in approaching fault surfaces. Based on these integrated information, we propose a structural evolutionary model for normal fault growth in poorly lithified sediments, which involves the development of fault strike-perpendicular joints during the lateral migration of fault tips. Numerical-analytical modelling (FRAPtre) validates the proposed evolutionary pathway and shows that such a fracture evolution and distribution may have a considerable impact on the fluid flow modelling for the successful exploitation of fractured reservoirs...|$|E

Practitioners seek to gain advantage over their opponents through footwork and body positioning to incorporate the use of leverage, avoiding the use of brute strength against brute strength.|$|R
