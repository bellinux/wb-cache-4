5000|$|Whole tenderloins {{are sold}} as either [...] "unpeeled" [...] (meaning {{the fat and}} <b>silver</b> <b>skin</b> remain), [...] "peeled" [...] (meaning that the fat is removed, but <b>silver</b> <b>skin</b> remains), or as PSMOs ("pismos"), which is short for peeled, <b>silver</b> <b>skin</b> removed, and side muscle (the [...] "chain") left on. While the most {{expensive}} option pound-for-pound, PSMOs offer considerable savings over other tenderloin options as they require little handling by the chef, since the fat and trimmings have already been removed. Since it is the tenderest part of the animal, beef dishes requiring exceptionally tender meat, such as steak tartare, are ideally made from the tenderloin.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} instar, {{commonly}} called the crawler, the nymph is 0.3mm {{in size and}} grows to be 0.6 mm till the fourth instar stage. During the first instar stage the body is greenish in color and flat in body structure. The mobile whitefly nymph walks to find a suitable area on the leaf with adequate nutrients and molts into four other instar or nymphal stages over the span of 40-50 days until it reaches adulthood. During molting, the flies shed <b>silver</b> <b>skins,</b> which are left on the leaves. During the instar phases, the whitefly maintains an opaque white appearance and does not move from the feeding site the crawler originally chooses. At the feeding site the nymphs use parts of their mouth to stab into the plant and consume the plant’s juices. The stage following the nymph stages is the pupal stage when the eyes become a deep red color, the body color becomes yellow, and the body structure thickens. After development is completed, adult whiteflies are approximately four {{times the size of}} the egg, with light yellow bodies and white wings.|$|R

5000|$|Set {{two years}} after Tiga's final battle, Daigo is {{approached}} by a mysterious woman, Kamila, who possessed a dark version of the Spark Lence. It is then revealed that more than 30,000,000 years ago, Tiga was originally evil in nature, {{part of a group}} of four that dominated Earth. The group consisted of Dark Tiga, the telepathic Kamila (gold patterns on <b>silver</b> <b>skin),</b> the powerful Dahram (red patterns on silver) and the speedy Hyudra (purple patterns on silver). One day, Tiga fell in love with a local human woman, and decided to convert from darkness to protect her from harm. Being the weakest of the four, Tiga quickly became a target of the group. However, unbeknownst to the group, the original [...] "talentless" [...] Tiga Dark possessed the ability to absorb powers from fallen enemies. As he eliminated each of the three dark members and sealed them away, he absorbed their powers which explains new Tiga's color patterns (purple, red and gold lined with his original silver). Convinced by his ability to convert the last known Spark Lence to good, Daigo accepts the gift and becomes Tiga once again, survives his inner struggles and vanishes the darkness within. Soon after this, he marries Rena Yanase, fellow GUTS member and longtime love interest (Shin Asuka, Dyna's eventual human host, also makes a cameo during the finale as a junior crew member, in a symbolic passing of the torch moment).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims at {{contributing}} {{to identify the}} eventual regions where fungus Aspergillus ochraceus could grow and produce ochratoxin A (OTA) during drying of coffee beans. Internal structure of coffee bean was analyzed by optical microscopy for endosperm and parchment. From {{the expression of the}} dissipation in the grain due to the water transport, we show that a relationship formally analogous to an equation of diffusion governs the water transport. Three structures with mass transfer resistance potential are studied: parchment, <b>silver</b> <b>skin</b> and endosperm. An experimental technique to study the water transfer into the parchment was proposed. In the endosperm, for moisture contents above 65 %, a constant transport coefficient controls the drying kinetics of the whole bean. Below this moisture content, water transport coefficient (with and without <b>silver</b> <b>skin)</b> were significantly lesser than those for the whole bean. This is firstly due to the reduction of the pore space occupied by water and second to the increasing bonding energy between solid structure and water as moisture content decreases. The contribution of parchment to the protection of the endosperm is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Frutos de café Mundo Novo, colhidos verdes, após o benefício, foram analisados quanto aos defeitos comerciais que apresentaram. A classificação foi efetuada independentemente, por três classificadores, com a contagem de grãos "normais" e daqueles considerados defeitos, isto é, "verde" (três categorias), "ardido" e "prêto". Notou-se uma elevada porcentagem de grãos normais quanto à coloração, e também a ocorrência de grãos dos tipos "ardido" e "prêto", no café não maduro. Com a remoção da película prateada verificou-se uma redução na porcentagem de grãos "verdes" e um acentuado aumento na porcentagem de grãos "ardidos", e um aumento menor na de grãos "normais" e "prêtos". Estas observações indicam que os grãos normalmente classificados no comércio como "verdes" devem esta característica à côr. anormal da película, e que os grãos "ardidos" têm, como uma das suas origens, a colheita de frutos verdes. The {{frequency}} of defective coffee beans was determined in samples of unripe {{fruits of the}} cultivar Mundo Novo (Coffea arabica). Ten samples of 1000 seeds each obtained from green fruits after sundrying and shelling were independently scored for the commercial defects by three coffee classifiers. Each one of the classifiers recorded the occurrence of green-coated, brown and black beans before and after removal of the <b>silver</b> <b>skin.</b> The data revealed {{that more than half}} of the beans had normal green color whereas 44. 9 per cent were green-coated, 3. 5 per cent were brown and 0. 1 per cent were black beans. The removal of the <b>silver</b> <b>skin</b> affected the previous classification giving 59. 7 per cent of normal green beans, 39. 5 per cent of brown and 0. 3 per cent of black beans. These observations indicated that the so-called green-coated beans are caused by the presence of the <b>silver</b> <b>skin</b> which retains green pigments probably chlorophyll. On the other hand the browns which have been considered as product of over-fermentation were scored in a much higher frequency whereas the percentage of black beans was little altered after the removal of the <b>silver</b> <b>skin.</b> The factors responsible for origin of the brown and black beans are discussed. Preliminary studies of the cup quality of the normal green beans selected from these samples indicated that the quality of the beverage had the poor taste characteristic of unripe coffee despite of the appearance of the beans...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{modification}} {{was applied}} to a coffee process by-product, <b>silver</b> <b>skin,</b> as well as raw coffee beans, with the aim to improve their aroma quality. Heat treatment in combination with sugar addition or enzyme treatment {{was applied to}} <b>silver</b> <b>skin</b> to encourage Maillard reactions. The manipulation applied to <b>silver</b> <b>skin,</b> however, did not give satisfactory results as the treatments neither caused significant increase in coffee aroma levels, nor yielded coffee aroma with quality resembling that of the real coffee. Chemical modification of raw Robusta coffee was carried out using fractionation and reconstitution approaches. The fractionation process involved the use of three types of solvent varying in polarity, dichloromethane (DCM), methanol (MeOH), and water, thus yielding four raw coffee fractions: DCM-soluble, MeOHsoluble, Water-soluble, and residue fractions. The reconstitution process involved wet mixing of the raw coffee fractions, vacuum drying and moisture content adjustment. Several reconstituted coffees were prepared with various proportions of the raw Robusta fractions, roasted and subjected to volatile analysis by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Statistical analysis by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the calculation of sum of normalized standard deviation (SNSD) of aroma compounds' odour activity values (OAVs) showed that the reconstituted Robusta that yielded the least variation, in term of aroma profile, from the higher quality coffee, Arabica, was the one composed of 70 % d. b. MeOH fraction, 30 % d. b. cell-wall material (residue), and 11 % w/w moisture content. The aroma profile of Arabica coffee {{was used as a}} reference due to its fine flavour that is commonly considered of better quality compared to that of Robusta (Briandet, Kemsley et al. 1996). Sensory evaluation (by sniffing) employing hedonic pairwise comparison technique confirmed the result from the GC-MS analysis that the aroma quality of the chosen reconstituted Robusta was improved since its aroma was significantly more preferred to that of the Robusta by the judges (30 people). Non-volatile compound analyses, however, suggested the need for further sensory study that involves tasting/drinking of the brews made with the new reconstituted Robusta for it contained significantly higher contents of bitter/astringent taste compounds, i. e. chlorogenic acids, caffeine and trigonelline, than the original coffees that could also affect the overall sensory quality of the coffee.

The nanocomposite preparation aims at combining the antimicrobial activity of <b>silver</b> with <b>skin</b> hydration performance of SLN. The nanocomposites designated Ag/SAN (silver/stearic acid nanoparticles), Ag/PAN (silver/palmitic acid nanoparticles) were prepared by incorporating silver nanoparticles into the dispersion of SLN and sonicating for 10  min followed by heating for 1  h at 50  °C in a thermostat. The occlusive property of the two nanocomposites was evaluated {{in comparison with the}} pure SLN by adopting de Vringer-de Ronde in vitro occlusion test. The incorporation of silver nanoparticles has improved occlusion factor by 10  % in the case of both composites at SLN concentration of 0. 14  mmol.
