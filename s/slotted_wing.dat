40|$|For {{some time}} the D. V. L. has been {{investigating}} the question of applicability of Handley Page <b>slotted</b> <b>wings</b> to German airplanes.

50|$|The {{wings of}} H. longicresta were broad and tapered, {{with an average}} wing area and wing loading {{compared}} to modern birds in the same size range. The {{presence or absence of}} <b>slotting</b> at the <b>wing</b> tips cannot be determined with known specimens, but modern birds with similar size and wing shape tend to lack <b>wing</b> <b>slotting.</b> The absence of <b>wing</b> <b>slotting</b> would suggest that Hongshanornis tended to fly mainly at relatively high speeds. Given the overall wing shape and comparison to modern birds, Hongshanornis probably flapped continuously when flying at lower speeds, and switched to bounding flight (rapid flapping alternating with periods of ballistic forward motion with the wings partly folded) at higher speeds. Overall, the wing and tail anatomy, and therefore probably flight style, of Hongshanornis was similar to many medium-sized passerine birds.|$|R

50|$|Nine British {{aircraft}} {{were started}} but only six completed, and of these only three gained Authorisation to Fly. All were Douglas engined {{and with an}} open cockpit.

50|$|During World War II, German {{aircraft}} commonly fitted a {{more advanced}} version that pushed back flush against the wing by air pressure to reduce drag, popping out when the angle of attack increased during slower flight. Notable slats of that time belonged to the German Fieseler Fi 156 Storch. These were similar in design to retractable slats, but were fixed non-retractable slots. The <b>slotted</b> <b>wing</b> allowed this aircraft to take off into a light wind in less than 45 m (150 ft), and land in 18 m (60 ft). Aircraft designed by the Messerschmitt company employed automatic, spring-loaded leading-edge slats as a general rule, except for the Alexander Lippisch-designed Messerschmitt Me 163B Komet rocket fighter, which used fixed slots built integrally with, and just behind the wing panel's outer leading edges instead.|$|E
50|$|Independently of Lachmann, Handley Page Ltd in Great Britain also {{developed}} the <b>slotted</b> <b>wing</b> {{as a way}} to postpone stall by reducing the turbulence over the wing at high angles of attack, and applied for a patent in 1919; to avoid a patent challenge, they reached an ownership agreement with Lachmann. That year a De Havilland D.H.9 was fitted with slats and flown. Later, a D.H.4 was modified as a monoplane with a large wing fitted with full span leading edge and back ailerons (i.e. what would later be called flaps) that could be deployed in conjunction with the leading-edge slats to test improved low speed performance. Several years later, having subsequently taken employment at the Handley-Page aircraft company, Lachmann was responsible for a number of aircraft designs, including the Handley Page Hampden.|$|E

5000|$|The AS-37 is {{conventionally}} {{constructed from}} wood, with a spruce structure covered with acajou plywood. The small gap, high stagger wing arrangement first proposed by Nenadovitch is the aircraft's most unusual feature, though one that its designer André Starck had used {{in two of}} his earlier aircraft, the AS-20 from 1942 and the AS-27 from the early 1970s. The wings have low aspect ratios; the upper one is mounted on the fuselage a little above mid-position and the lower {{at the bottom of}} the fuselage, making the gap unusually small. The stagger is sufficient to place the upper trailing edge a little ahead of the lower leading edge. Together, the two wings were intended to have some of the desirable characteristics of a single, <b>slotted</b> <b>wing.</b> The AS-37 has wings of unequal span and chord, the lower one smaller, joined not by conventional interplane struts but by wing tip [...] "curtains". These aerodynamic surfaces, as broad in chord as the lower wings, lean outwards at 45° with ailerons attached to their trailing edges. As well as stiffening the wing structure, these curtains were said to improve lateral control and stall behaviour.|$|E
40|$|<b>Slotted</b> <b>wing</b> tips {{of birds}} are {{commonly}} considered an adaptation to improve soaring performance, despite {{their presence in}} species that neither soar nor glide.

The separated primary feathers produce individual wakes, confirming a multi-slotted function, in both gliding and flapping flight. The resulting multi-cored wingtip vortex represents a spreading of vorticity, which has previously been suggested as indicative of increased aerodynamic efficiency. Considering benefits of the <b>slotted</b> <b>wing</b> tips that are specific to flapping flight combined with the wide phylogenetic occurrence of this configuration, we propose the hypothesis that slotted wings evolved initially to improve performance in powered flight...|$|E

40|$|Variable camber {{actuator}} assemblies {{broaden the}} range of speeds at which lift to drag performance is maximized for <b>slotted</b> flap <b>wings.</b> Lift is improved over {{a broader range of}} cruising speeds by varying wing camber with rotational flap movements that do not introduce <b>wing</b> <b>slots</b> and induced drag. Forward flaps are secured to forward flange links which extended from, and are a part of forward flap linkage assemblies. The forward flaps rotate about flap pivots with their rotational displacement controlled by variable camber actuator assemblies located between the forward flaps and the forward flange links. Rear flaps are held relative to the forward flaps by rear flap linkage assemblies which may act independently from the forward flap linkage assemblies and the variable camber actuator assemblies. Wing camber is varied by rotating the flaps with the variable camber actuator assemblies while the flaps are in a deployed or tucked position. Rotating the flaps in a tucked position does not introduce significant wing surface discontinuities, and reduces aircraft fuel consumption on most flight profiles...|$|R
