5|$|The American counteroffensive of 3–5 September west of Yongsan {{resulted}} {{in one of}} the bloodiest and most terrifying debacles of the war for a North Korean division, according to historians. Even though remnants of the NK 9th Division, supported by the low strength NK 4th Division, still held Obong-ni Ridge, Cloverleaf Hill, and the intervening ground back to the Naktong on 6 September, the division's offensive strength had been <b>spent</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the American counterattack. The NK 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Five days of filming were <b>spent</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> London Underground tunnels. Filming {{took place}} on actual tube tunnels, albeit disused ones. As the crew were {{scouting}} the disused Aldwych tunnels, they found the ex-Northern line 1972 stock train stabled in the tunnel for maintenance, training, and filming purposes. When Sam Miller called Cross about the development, the writer included it as a last minute addition to the script, and the sequence was shot the next day. As a way to scare the audience, Cross included a homeless woman living in the train. The filming crew present disliked filming the Underground sequences because while filmed during the summer, it became hot locations to work in. The crew were prohibited from bringing food or drink into the tunnels, as it would attract rats. Furthermore, break times had to be longer than usual because {{it would take a}} while for a crew member to leave the tunnels, have a break and then return. The FSB base was filmed in the London Docklands, near the ExCeL London.|$|E

5|$|The 20th Battalion was {{evacuated}} to Egypt, {{having lost}} over half its original complement of personnel during the Greece and Crete campaigns. After {{a short period}} of rest, Kippenberger set about bringing the battalion back up to strength. Nearly 400 replacements joined the battalion and stragglers, separated from the battalion for various reasons during the previous two months while in Greece and Crete, continued to arrive for several weeks {{as they made their way}} across the Mediterranean by various means, including small sailboats. By mid-June, the battalion was at full strength and several weeks were <b>spent</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> battalion's previous positions at Baggush, engaged in intensive desert training.|$|E
5|$|Through {{a series}} of marches, the 6th Machine Gun Battalion moved from Camp Bois de L' Eveque to Bois des Hayes {{arriving}} on 8 September 1918. This camp was in close vicinity to the front line. The time <b>spent</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camp was used to prepare ammunition and supply dumps, conduct a reconnaissance of the area, and set up firing positions for the upcoming offensive around Saint-Mihiel. The battalion went into battle on 12 September 1918. During the fighting, the 6th Machine Gun Battalion's companies were again assigned to their respective battalions within the two Marine regiments. The 6th Machine Gun Battalion's job was to lay down suppressive fire and to establish a defensive position until the respective Marine regimental battalions arrived.|$|E
5|$|Traveling back to Spain {{to recruit}} more missionaries, he {{continued}} lobbying for {{the abolition of}} the encomienda, gaining an important victory by the passing of the New Laws in 1542. He was appointed Bishop of Chiapas, but served only for a short time before he was forced to return to Spain because of resistance to the New Laws by the encomenderos, and conflicts with Spanish settlers because of his pro-Indian policies and activist religious stances. The remainder of his life was <b>spent</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Spanish court where he held great influence over Indies-related issues. In 1550, he participated in the Valladolid debate in which Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda argued that the Indians were less than human and required Spanish masters in order to become civilized. Las Casas maintained that they were fully human and that forcefully subjugating them was unjustifiable.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the value}} placed by the Hohenzollern family on a {{traditional}} military education, Augusta insisted {{that her son}} also receive a classical education. Accordingly, Frederick was thoroughly tutored in both military traditions and the liberal arts. His private tutor was Ernst Curtius, a famous archaeologist. Frederick was a talented student, particularly good at foreign languages, becoming fluent in English and French, and studying Latin. He also studied history, geography, physics, music and religion, and excelled at gymnastics; as required of a Prussian prince, he became a very good rider. Hohenzollern princes were made familiar with the military traditions of their dynasty at an early age; Frederick was ten when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the First Infantry Regiment of Guards and invested with the Order of the Black Eagle. As he grew older, {{he was expected to}} maintain an active involvement in military affairs. But, at the age of 18, he broke with family tradition and entered the University of Bonn where he studied history, law and governance and public policy. During his time at Bonn (1850-1852), his teachers included Ernst Moritz Arndt and Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann. His time <b>spent</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> university, coupled with the influence of less conservative family members, were instrumental in his embrace of liberal beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{probably}} {{retained its}} form as established by 1100 until {{the reign of}} Richard the Lionheart (1189–1199). The castle was extended under William Longchamp, King Richard's Lord Chancellor {{and the man in}} charge of England while he was on crusade. The Pipe Rolls record £2,881 1s 10d <b>spent</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tower of London between 3 December 1189 and 11 November 1190, from an estimated £7,000 spent by Richard on castle building in England. According to the contemporary chronicler Roger of Howden, Longchamp dug a moat around the castle and tried in vain to fill it from the Thames. Longchamp was also Constable of the Tower, and undertook its expansion while preparing for war with King Richard's younger brother, Prince John, who in Richard's absence arrived in England to try to seize power. As Longchamp's main fortress, he made the Tower as strong as possible. The new fortifications were first tested in October 1191, when the Tower was besieged for the first time in its history. Longchamp capitulated to John after just three days, deciding he had more to gain from surrender than prolonging the siege.|$|E
