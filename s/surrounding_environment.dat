5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment.</b> Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
5|$|According to a Wizards of the Coast article, Strahd {{has become}} one of the most infamous and {{well-known}} villains in the Dungeons & Dragons game, and he has appeared in a number of novels and rulebooks since his debut in Ravenloft. In an introduction to an online edition of RavenloftII, author John D. Rateliff described Strahd as a then-unusual fusion of a monster with the abilities of a player character class; that is, a vampire magic-user. This design enables him to combine his own powers with the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment,</b> making him a difficult opponent to defeat.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{typically}} use {{the color}} green as camouflage, blending {{in with the}} chlorophyll green of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment.</b> Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also {{be affected by the}} <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment.</b> For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.|$|E

5|$|Insect ecology is the {{scientific}} study of how insects, individually or as a community, interact with the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment</b> or ecosystem. Insects play {{one of the most important}} roles in their ecosystems, which includes many roles, such as soil turning and aeration, dung burial, pest control, pollination and wildlife nutrition. An example is the beetles, which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms. These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.|$|E
5|$|Lycoperdon echinatum can {{be found}} either solitary or in small groups. It {{typically}} grows {{on the ground in}} deciduous forests and grassy areas, glades and pastures, on moss, humus, or woody debris. The fungus has been noted to have a preference for beech woods. Fruit bodies may make their appearance anytime from the late spring to autumn. Older specimens {{are more likely to be}} overlooked, as their brown color blends into the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment</b> of dead leaves and dead wood. The puffball is used by various species of scuttle flies (family Phoridae) as larval food.|$|E
5|$|One action RPG that avoided these {{limitations}} is Deus Ex (2000), designed by Warren Spector. It offered multiple {{solutions to problems}} through intricately layered dialogue choices, a deep skill tree, and hand-crafted environments. Players were challenged to act in character through dialog choices appropriate {{to his or her}} chosen role, and by intelligent use of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment.</b> This produced a unique experience that was tailored to each player. According to Spector, the game's dialogue choices were inspired by a console role-playing game, Suikoden.|$|E

5|$|Decline in age, size during sexual {{maturity}} in {{great northern tilefish}} population is occurring throughout the continental shelf. In the mid-Atlantic Bight, smaller sizes and younger ages at maturity were observed in 2008, compared to the survey data from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population. The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment</b> {{due to the fact}} that without tilefish, the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E
5|$|Demographers or sociologists of {{population}} study the size, composition and {{change over time}} of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study {{of population}} is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment</b> and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and {{is closely related to}} human geography. Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the cloud}} pattern {{associated}} with the system featured a tight and well-defined circulation, as well as clusters of deep convection south of the center. Due to the proximity of a large upper-level low-pressure area in the southern Gulf of Mexico, the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment</b> did not favor intensification. Influenced by the low, the depression moved southward. The system completed a cyclonic loop in the central gulf, and by early on September 18 was drifting northward. As a result of wind shear, the center of circulation was separated from the deep convective activity. Early the next day, deep convection persisted in a small area northeast of the center. Forward motion was nearly stationary, with a gradual drift east-southeastward. Despite the wind shear, the depression attained tropical storm status at 1200 UTC on September19; as such, it was named Hermine by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

5|$|Once a colossus is found, {{the player}} must {{discover}} its weaknesses to defeat it. Each colossus dwells {{in a unique}} lair, and many colossi cannot be defeated without making use of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment.</b> Every colossus {{has at least one}} weak point, indicated by a glowing sigil that can be illuminated and identified by the sword's reflected light. Each colossus has areas covered with fur or protruding ledges, which Wander may use to grip and scale the colossus while it thrashes about in an attempt to dislodge him. While scaling a colossus, the player must act quickly, as Wander has a limited stamina gauge that decreases while he hangs onto the creature.|$|E
5|$|Orford Castle {{was given}} to the Ministry of Works in 1962, and is now {{maintained}} by English Heritage. The keep of the castle is {{the only part of the}} structure remaining intact, although the earthwork remains of the bailey wall are still visible; some of the ditches visible amongst the earthworks, however, are not medieval, but instead the result of the earlier quarrying of the bailey walls. The Orford Museum Trust has created exhibits in the upper hall featuring displays of archaeological artefacts found locally. Archaeological work to understand the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment</b> has continued, most recently during 2002 to 2003. The castle is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of a}} {{millipede}} {{is typically}} rounded above and flattened below and bears a pair of large mandibles {{in front of a}} plate-like structure called a gnathochilarium ("jaw lip"). The head contains a single pair of antennae with seven or eight segments and a group of sensory cones at the tip. Many orders also possess a pair of sensory organs known as the Tömösváry organs, shaped as small oval rings posterior and lateral {{to the base of the}} antennae. Their function is unknown, but they also occur in some centipedes, and are possibly used to measure humidity or light levels in the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E

30|$|Knowledge of {{the channel}} model for UWB {{transmission}} is critical for any robust transceiver system. Moreover, body area networks exhibit unique radio propagation characteristics combining line of sight, creeping wave, multiple reflections from <b>surrounding</b> <b>environments,</b> and diffraction around the human body. Ever since the FCC released unlicensed spectrum for UWB, several previous works on UWB channel modeling have been published. Molisch et al. [9] developed an IEEE 802.15. 4 a channel model for various low-rate UWB applications, where the body area network channel model is analyzed using a finite difference time-domain (FDTD) simulator with antennas moving around the human body. Wang et al. [10] also used FDTD method to simulate various body postures based on a realistic human body model. Unfortunately, these numerical approaches neglect considerations of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environments,</b> which are the main sources of multipath.|$|R

5|$|Understanding {{traits of}} {{individual}} organisms helps explain patterns and processes at other levels of organization including populations, communities, and ecosystems. Several areas of ecology of evolution {{that focus on}} such traits are life history theory, ecophysiology, metabolic theory of ecology, and Ethology. Examples of such traits include features of an organisms life cycle such as age to maturity, life span, or metabolic costs of reproduction. Other traits {{may be related to}} structure, such as the spines of a cactus or dorsal spines of a bluegill sunfish, or behaviors such as courtship displays or pair bonding. Other traits include emergent properties that are the result at least in part of interactions with the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment</b> such as growth rate, resource uptake rate, winter, and deciduous vs. drought deciduous trees and shrubs.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} stalled {{a couple hundred}} miles {{southeast}} of Bermuda on October 10. During that day, a strong upper-level trough moved southeastward off the southeast coast of the United States. Due to several factors, including upward motion and strong diffluence—the rate at which a fluid moves—the area became baroclinically unstable. This caused {{the interaction between the}} trough and the front to develop into an extratropical low about 345miles (555km) southeast of Bermuda on October 11. The low moved quickly northward, then northwestward, strengthening quickly due to the instability of the atmosphere. Late on October 11, the system slowed, and the upper-level circulation became aligned with the low-level circulation. The extratropical storm began to develop tropical characteristics late on October 11, including surface temperatures warmer than the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment,</b> and vertical wind characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Based on its organization, the system developed into Subtropical Storm One early on October 12 while located about 35miles (55km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. The levels of {{pollution}} in the atmosphere trigger massive environmental changes, making the world hostile to human life. On the brink of extinction, humanity creates Basel, a giant air purification module controlled by the Zenith System. As conditions worsened in the land surrounding Basel, the remnants of humanity gathered around it and built a great city {{at the base of}} Zenith's tower. While Basel and the Zenith System control the <b>surrounding</b> <b>environment</b> to make it habitable for humans, it also controls the human population: each person has their social status determined at birth, and their exact lifespan is controlled through quartz crystals programmed by Zenith. Basel evolves for countless years into a class-driven society, the populace forgets everything about Basel's past: those {{at the top of the}} tower are the city's leaders, dubbed Cardinals, and indoctrinate the people into a religion deifying the Zenith System.|$|E
