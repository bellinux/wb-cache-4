40|$|Integral <b>skin</b> <b>foams</b> {{consist of}} a {{cellular}} core and a near solid skin of the same material surrounding the cope. A study {{of the effect of}} mica on the flexural properties of free rise and integral <b>skin</b> polyurethane <b>foams</b> is presented. Addition of a small amount of mica (5 % v/v) is found to significantly increase the flexural modulus of free rise foams; however, the modulus remains nearly constant with further increase in mica concentration when compared at equal densities. The flexural strength of free rise foams is found to decrease with an increase in mica concentration. Similar trends with mica concentration are obtained for the integral <b>skin</b> <b>foams</b> of a fixed overall density. In this case, the properties of the foams are also dependent on structural parameters such as the skin and core thicknesses and the corresponding densities which are measured. A three region model for the integral <b>skin</b> <b>foam</b> structure (core and two skins) is developed to obtain the flexural modulus and strength for foams with dissimilar upper and lower skins in terms of the thickness and the properties of the regions. Empirical equations, based on the experimental data for free rise foams with different mica loadings, relating the flexural modulus and flexural strength to the density, are used to calculate the properties of each region in the model. The predicted values obtained from the model are found to be in reasonable agreement with experimentally measured values of flexural modulus and flexural strength. The mode of failure (tensile rupture as opposed to wrinkling) is also correctly predicted by the model...|$|R

40|$|Polyurethane {{integral}} <b>skin</b> <b>foams</b> {{comprise a}} low density foamed core {{surrounded by a}} high density skin of the same material, and are made in a single molding operation. Polyurethane integral <b>skin</b> <b>foams</b> find wide application as structural materials, and the mechanical properties of such foams are significantly affected by the foam structure, {{which in turn is}} determined by the foaming process. An experimental and theoretical study of the foam formation process is presented. Experimental results show that increase in the mold wall temperature results in an increase in the upper skin thickness, a decrease in the lower skin thickness, and a decrease in the density of both skins. The core density increases with increasing wall temperature. Increase in the blowing agent concentration produces a small increase in the skin thickness. Computations based on the model of Marciano et al. [Polym. Eng. Sci, 26, 717 (1986) ] are presented using an efficient numerical technique. Predictions of the model for the skin thickness, core density and pressure and temperature variation with time are in reasonable agreement with experimental data. The model, however, predicts higher skin densities than the experimental measurements. A modification of the initial condition of the model to account for the air bubbles dispersed during mixing gives better agreement between theory and experiment...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Integral <b>skin</b> <b>foam</b> (designated ISF) {{consisting}} of core (cellular <b>foam)</b> and solid <b>skin</b> {{is produced in}} one operation. Since the recommendation of Montreal Protocol in 1987 to phase out five CFCs, the three major possibilities for producing ISF studied in the past include replacement of CFC with HCFC, HFC, or water. Recently, the use of HCFC- 141 b for blowing agent was also phased {{out at the end}} of 2003, and HFCs have been criticized for their high Global Warming Potential (GWP). However, it is difficult to produce a skin layer using water as the blowing agent because carbon dioxide (CO 2), which is generated by an isocyanate–water reaction is unlikely to condense at the mold surface. We have developed a new technology to produce all-water-blown ISF. A novel polypropylene glycol, which contains an extremely small amount of by-products (monool) and has narrow molecular weight distribution compared with conventional polypropylene glycols was applied to this new system. In case of applying this novel polypropylene glycol in all-water-blown ISF system, it is easy to control the balance between the gelling reaction and blowing reaction of ISF. Therefore, we have been able to obtain a tight skin layer like HFC-blown ISF. KEY WORDS: integral <b>skin</b> <b>foam,</b> polypropylene glycols, low monol, all water blown...|$|R

It can be formed in an open-mold process or a closed-mold process. In the open-mold process, two reactive components are mixed and poured into an open mold. The mold is then closed and the mixture is allowed to expand and cure. Examples of items produced using this process include arm rests, baby seats, shoe soles, and mattresses. The closed-mold process, more commonly known as reaction injection molding (RIM), injects the mixed components into a closed mold under high pressures.|$|R

40|$|The {{effective}} flexural {{properties of}} integral <b>skin</b> <b>foams</b> (ISF), are modeled using Euler-Bernouli beam theory {{along with a}} power law empirical equation relating the properties of a homogeneous foam to its density. The optimal density profile that maximizes the effective flexural modulus of an ISF beam of fixed overall density, and with the density constrained to lie in a given range, is continuous when the power law exponent (n) is less than 1. For n > 1, the optimal density profile is discontinuous with a low density core and a high density skin. The effective flexural modulus of such sandwich beams is maximized for a fixed density ratio (ratio of the core density to the skin density) and fixed overall density. The maximal flexural modulus is found to increase monotonically with decreasing density ratios and increasing values of n. The flexural strength of the sandwich beam is also maximized considering failure to occur by tensile fracture or buckling of the skin. In this case an optimal skin thickness and an optimal density ratio are obtained for a fixed overall density. The results are useful for the design and evaluation of flat ISF panels...|$|R

Natural flax fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs) have potential applications as lightweight skins for utility poles, pedestrian bridge elements, and small wind turbine shafts but the structural behaviour of flax-FRP wrapped foam beams {{has yet to be}} investigated. Six beams with various internal foam density and fibre arrangements were constructed and tested.

A fabrication technique for constructing the tubes was developed and presented here. An arrangement using 5 layers of longitudinal flax fibres and 3 hoop flax fibres gives similar strength to the glass-FRP control; 4 longitudinal and 3 hoop flax fibres is expected to give similar stiffness to the glass-FRP control. Flexural strength and stiffness was found to be proportional to the number of longitudinal layers. Increasing the amount of hoop layers shifted the failure mode from compression to tension controlled. Flax-FRP beams that failed in compression gave slightly more warning and higher deflections than those that failed in tension.
