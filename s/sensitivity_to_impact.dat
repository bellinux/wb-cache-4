40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>impact</b> plays a {{major role}} in {{limiting}} the design strains available in carbon fibre composite laminates and structures. Relatively low energy impacts can give rise to splitting in unidirectional composites, and delamination in multi-axial laminates, due to transverse and through thickness tensile stresses induced by the impact. This damage can then propagate under compressive loading leading to a great reduction in compressive strength. If the components could have imposed on them a transverse compressive pre-stress this would offset the effects of impact and lead to structures that are less sensitive to impact. The work reported here covers the imposition of such a pre-stress by overwinding structural elements with aramid fibre under considerable tension. The level of prestress in overwound rods has been investigated. Rod specimens have been impacted and tested after impact; a very substantial increase in compressive strength after impact has been observed...|$|E

Under a given loading condition, binary microstructure exhibits the highest k, indicating the best protective performance.

The current paper provides an assessment of a simple box-beam underfloor structure typically found in metallic helicopters and provides an overview of the failure modes and the collapse mechanism observed when dropped onto a hard surface. All findings are supported by quantitative measurements and extensive photographic evidence. The current paper identifies two limitations with the existing design, which are based upon the observations of the failure modes for different frame types and the performance of the intersection joints. In order to increase the level of crashworthiness currently offered, significant frame and joint redesign is required in order to provide a more progressive collapse.

40|$|International audienceDue to high {{specific}} strength and stiffness for low weight, composite materials are increasingly used in modern industry. However, one weakness of such materials is their <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>impacts,</b> which may cause severe and harmful damages. The crack-like defects created by <b>impacts</b> may lead <b>to</b> local decays in composites properties, i. e., {{in the vicinity}} of the impacted zone.

In this work, we study the interaction behavior of A 0 and S 0 Lamb waves with a conical damaged zone created during a point impact on the surface of a carbon fiber reinforced composite (CFRC) plate. A 3 -Dimensional Finite Element model is used to simulate the scattering by the damaged zone of the above mentioned guided modes. The damaged zone inside the composite plate has been modeled as a conical shaped geometry with decayed material stiffness properties. The directivity pattern of the scattered field for the A 0 and S 0 modes are predicted from 3 D Finite Element simulations and plotted graphically for various positions of the defect. The results will be used as a basis for the quantification of the detection sensitivity for impact zones in CFRC using guided wave sensors...|$|R

In order to provide the biological information for an evaluation and the conservation management of the Weser estuary, the spatial distribution of benthic invertebrates and their <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> human interference was investigated in three case studies. Additional external data of benthic invertebrates were added to provide a comprehensive database that allows a transfer of recognized principles from the case studies to a benthic characterisation of the entire estuary. By including the supratidal areas in the analysis, 10 brackish subzones were identified and compared by area and benthic assemblages. In contrast to earlier characterisation by dominant or frequent species, a biotope characterisation by brackish-water species is suggested, which allows the identification of small-structured biotopes.

The designs of modern aircraft, particularly military fighter aircraft, demand high-strength, high-stiffness, low-weight materials. While multiphase composite materials of various kinds have been used for centuries, the development in the last 40 years of high-stiffness continuous fibers, either of graphite or glass, has changed the picture for aerospace materials. Coupled with reliable interfacial chemistry at the fiber-matrix interface and advanced epoxies and thermoplastics, composite laminates began appearing in high-performance aircraft around 1970. The boron-epoxy speed brake on the McDonnell-Douglas F- 15 A was one of the first such applications. With better control of the graphitizing process, high-stiffness, micron-sized carbon fibers began making their appearance composite form. These fibrous composite laminates have fulfilled the demand for ever stiffer and lighter materials, but not without some disadvantages.

40|$|Abstract Traditionally, {{alkalinity}} {{has been}} widely used {{in order to determine}} the level of acid sensitivity, while pH values were often viewed as an indicator from <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>impact.</b> These methods of assign-ing acidity classifications are problematic, due to large temporal changes in flow conditions and various geological types, which influence the results. The Sodium Dominance Index (SDI) is essentially a ratio of cations, namely, the concentration of Na+, divided by the sum of the concentrations of Na+, Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 + expressed as a percentage. Values of> 60 SDI denoted sites ‘at high risk ’ of acidification and were therefore classified acid sensitive. From a total of 248 sites (65 of which were forested) in Ireland, base flow sample results showed significant correlations between SDI, alkalinity and pH levels. Significant relationships for SDI to differing underlying geologies were also noted. The data suggested no effect of coniferous forest on the SDI results. It was found that SDI did not differ significantly between base and elevated flow condi-tions.
