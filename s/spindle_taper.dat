40|$|The Woodruff Family Collection: From {{the time}} the Woodruff Family came to Canada from the United States in 1795, they took {{an active role in}} the forming of their {{communities}} both in a civic and social manner. This is evident through the documents contained in this collection. The Woodruffs played {{an active role in the}} battles fought in Upper Canada and they were an integral part of the Village of St. Davids. They were educated, business-minded and socially engaged. They accumulated much of their fortune through land dealings. Much of this collection focuses on Samuel DeVeaux Woodruff who was principally a businessman. His dedication to his work is shown through his numerous undertakings. He made his mark on the Niagara Peninsula through his work on the railways, roads, marsh land revisions, canals and the paper industry. He was also involved with the founding of the Long Point Company and he took control of building DeVeaux Hall down to the last detail. His offspring inherited his work ethic and his business acumen. The people who married into the Woodruff Family also possessed key social, political and business ties. Anne and Margaret Clement were from a staunch Loyalist background. Samuel Zimmerman was instrumental to the founding of Niagara Falls and Judge Samuel DeVeaux left behind a legacy for poor and homeless boys in Niagara Falls, New York. The Woodruff Family undoubtedly left a mark on the Niagara Peninsula. This collection brings to light many endeavours of the family and their varied contributions. 2. 16 m.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Transitional cell {{carcinoma}} of the cervix (TCCC) is a rare neoplasm of recent description. The cytologic characteristics of the tumor have not been published to date. Six cases of TCCC are described, including their clinical, histologic, cytologic and immunohistochemical features. CASES: All cases presented at an advanced clinical stage; two recurred, and one metastasized. Five cases showed a papillary exophytic pattern, and one case showed an "inverted" endophytic pattern {{similar to that of}} transitional {{cell carcinoma}} of the urothelium (TCCU). The cytokeratin profile was similar to that of squamous cell {{carcinoma of the}} cervix (SCCC), positive for CK 7 and negative for CK 20. The cervical smears showed a background that was necrotic or hemorrhagic. The cells with transitional features formed cohesive groups in a multilayered fashion and had an oval or <b>spindle</b> shape with <b>tapered</b> ends. The nuclei were hyperchromatic, with coarse and medium-sized granules that frequently displayed a wrinkled membrane, nuclear grooves and rare pseudoinclusions. The nucleoli were small or absent. Others cells with cytologic characteristics of SCCC were seen in all cases. CONCLUSION: TCCC is a rare neoplasm that probably represents a subgroup of SCCC. The most frequent histologic pattern is papillary-exophytic, but it can be inverted-endophytic. In cervical smears there are cells with characteristics of regular SCCC and others resembling those of TCCU. A larger number of cases is needed to define the evolution and clinical outcome...|$|R
40|$|Mature Drosophila oocytes {{are arrested}} in {{metaphase}} {{of the first}} meiotic division. We have examined microtubule and chromatin reorganization as the meiosis I spindle assembles on maturation using indirect immunofluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy. The results suggest that chromatin captures or nucleates microtubules, and that these subsequently form a highly <b>tapered</b> <b>spindle</b> in which the majority of microtubules do not terminate at the poles. Nonexchange homologs separate {{from each other and}} move toward opposite poles during spindle assembly. By the time of metaphase arrest, these chromosomes are positioned on opposite half spindles, between the metaphase plate and the spindle poles, with the large nonexchange X chromosomes always closer to the metaphase plate than the smaller nonexchange fourth chromosomes. Nonexchange homologs are therefore oriented on the spindle {{in the absence of a}} direct physical linkage, and the spindle position of these chromosomes appears to be determined by size. Loss-of-function mutations at the nod locus, which encodes a kinesin-like protein, cause meiotic loss and nondisjunction of nonexchange chromosomes, but have little or no effect on exchange chromosome segregation. In oocytes lacking functional nod protein, most of the nonexchange chromosomes are ejected from the main chromosomal mass shortly after the nuclear envelope breaks down and microtubules interact with the chromatin. In addition, the nonexchange chromosomes that are associated with spindles in nod/nod oocytes show excessive poleward migration. Based on these observations, and the structural similarity of the nod protein and kinesin, we propose that nonexchange chromosomes are maintained on the half spindle by opposing poleward and anti-poleward forces, and that the nod protein provides the anti-poleward force...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{establish}} the cytological criteria {{to identify the}} urothelial cells in cervical smears {{in order to avoid}} mistakes in the cytological diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Cervical smears from 34 post menopausal women with vesicovaginal fistulas, advanced bladder prolapse and genital erosive lichen planes (vulvar kraurosis) (Group 1) and transitional cell metaplasia of the cervix (TCM, Group 2) were stained with Papanicolaou technique. The cervical samples were taken during the routine annual examination for prevention of the uterine cancer. Results: The smears of cervix from Group 1 showed urothelial cells from the three layers of the transitional epithelium. The umbrella cells are the bigger ones with relatively large nuclei. Frequently, they are multinucleated with single or multiple nucleoli and a typical "frothy" cytoplasm (cytoplasmic vacuoles). The cells of the Group 2 showed nuclei with oval to <b>spindled</b> shapes, some <b>tapered</b> ends, less cytoplasm than squamous metaplastic cells, powdery chromatin, small nucleoli and nuclear grooves. Conclusions: The umbrella cells may be mistaken for dysplastic cells originating in low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions lesions (LSILs) due to their nuclear and cytoplasm sizes. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} the possibility of their appearance in the cervical smears, especially in post menopausal patients in order to avoid a false diagnosis of an intraepithelial lesion. It is unlikely that deeper cells of urothelium would be confused with high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cells. However, their presence might be a reason of mistake in the diagnosis. TCM is an under-recognized metaplastic phenomenon of the cervix and vagina, which is a mimicker of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. The differential characteristic between umbrella cells, cells from TCM and the deeper urothelial cells, and LSIL and HSIL are detailed in the present paper...|$|R
