In the present study, firstly, the test system is constructed on the basis of Digital Image Correlation (D. I. C.) in order to measure local strains all over the surface of object. Then, local strain distributions generated in SMAC are measured under heating. Results in present study are as follows: (1) Longitudinal local strain reveals inhomogeneous deformation behavior during austenite transformation of SMA fiber, and shows distribution along to x and y direction after austenite transformation. Also, we can see that the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> is different between x and y directions after austenite transformation. (2) Lateral local strain begins to generate around fiber during austenite transformation of SMA, and shows distribution along to only y direction after austenite transformation. This distribution is caused by thermal expansion of matrix.

From the detailed description of the current state it is clear that most of the equipment is beyond its mean time to breakdown and has been in operation longer than intended. The next chapters describe possible solutions to reconstruction of the facilities. The first option – marked as option A – aims to maintain the existing 10 kV distribution lines. Option B presents a solution in the form of abolition of urban transformation and transition to the 35 kV voltage level (which is the voltage level used in the CEZ Distribution plc, eastern area). A comparison of proposed options is made in the technical-economic evaluation. The evaluation brings a detailed description of progress of implementation and planning of the reconstruction of facility particular parts for individual years. The conclusion summarizes the results of the technical-economic assessment of both options and gives reasons why option B, which proposes transition to the 35 kV voltage level, is more advantageous...|$|E

40|$|AbstractResults {{of earlier}} {{multiple}} object tracking (MOT) studies imply that humans can track several moving targets in a 2 D environment simultaneously. Recently, a study suggested that stereoscopic depth has {{positive effect on}} tracking multiple objects when the objects are presented separately on multiple planes. However, it remains unclear whether or not humans can track moving targets in a real 3 D environment. In this study, we investigated this issue displaying four targets and four distractors on near and/or far depth planes separated physically by 6, 10 or 50 cm using a half-mirror and two CRT-monitors. In addition we also tested whether participants could track the targets when either a target or a distractor changed depth during tracking. Our results suggested that performance dropped if the targets were presented on both depth planes especially when {{the distance between the}} planes was 50 cm. In addition, participants could track a depth-changed target if targets were presented on both planes before the start of a motion phase regardless of whether the initial state of targets distribution randomly varied or not, whereas they failed to track the target if all targets were presented on a single plane before MOT. In conclusion, humans have the ability to set attention on a wide range for MOT in a real 3 D environment, with the provision that the efficiency of the tracking is critically dependent not only on the distance in depth but also on an initial <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> of the targets without the predictability of the initial state...|$|E

40|$|In {{the search}} to {{accommodate}} increasing shares {{of renewable energy}} into today's electricity system, demand response has received renewed research attention. At the same time, the introduction of charging electric vehicles (EVs) at residential locations highlights the fact that current distribution grids were not dimensioned for the coinciding activation of such large loads. Solutions are needed that safeguard the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> grids {{and at the same}} time allow large-scale demand response based on market objectives. In this thesis, scenarios are investigated where demand response of EVs is problematic for the state of the grid, and an algorithm is developed for demand response of charging EVs. This agent-based algorithm allows to integrate typical market objectives with the hard constraints at the distribution grid level. Through simulations, the severity of the conflict between market and technical objectives is examined, and the use of voltage droop control as possible solution is evaluated. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Smart grids 1. 2 Demand Response 1. 3 Ancillary services 1. 4 Challenges & requirements 1. 5 Outline & context 2 Electric Vehicles & Communication 2. 1 Charging of EVs and limitations 2. 2 Standardization efforts 2. 3 Vehicle-grid communication 2. 4 Conclusion 3 Algorithms for Demand Response of Electric Vehicles 3. 1 Distributed DR algorithms 3. 2 Centralized DR algorithms 3. 3 Aggregate & dispatch DR algorithms 3. 4 Conclusion on the DR algorithms 3. 5 Distribution grid congestion 3. 6 Ancillary services and grid support 3. 7 Conclusion 4 Simulator for Demand-Response Interaction 4. 1 Structure overview 4. 2 Data logging and Matlab interface 4. 3 Loadflow simulation 4. 4 Data models 4. 5 Conclusion 5 Multi-Agent Market-Based Control for Electric Vehicle Charging 5. 1 MAS MBC 5. 2 Multi-agent MBC with planning 5. 3 Shortcomings 5. 4 Conclusion 6 Event-based Multi-Agent Market-Based Control: RT-MBC 6. 1 Introduction 6. 2 Dual coordination 6. 3 Event-based interaction 6. 4 Energy compensation 6. 5 Conclusion 7 Validation 7. 1 Demand function evaluation 7. 2 Communication limitations 7. 3 Conclusion 8 Market-setting Applications 8. 1 Problem description 8. 2 Grid topology and agent structure 8. 3 ToU coordinated charging 8. 4 ToU coordinated charging, passive distribution grid 8. 5 ToU coordinated charging, active distribution grid 8. 6 Balancing case 8. 7 Balancing case, passive distribution grid 8. 8 Balancing case, active distribution grid 8. 9 Multi-aggregator case 8. 10 Multi-aggregator case with active distribution grid 9 Conclusions and Future Work 9. 1 Summary of the chapters 9. 2 Conclusions regarding the research objectives 9. 3 Future work A Extended Load Flow Results B Balancing casestatus: publishe...|$|E
