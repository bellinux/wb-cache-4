40|$|AbstractDiabetes {{is one of}} {{the most}} <b>serious,</b> <b>threatening,</b> developing, and costly health problems. This disease can {{influence}} the psychological and especially physical dimensions of people. The aim of current study was investigation of the effects of group Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Cognitive Behavioral Group Training (CBGT) in improving physical health outcomes among adults with diabetes type 2. Ninety- three Patients with type 2 diabetes were selected from Iranian Diabetes Society and Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism. The participants were randomly allocated to the MI group, CBGT group, and the control group and were tested before and after intervention. Each of interventions consisted of four 90 minutes group sessions. The findings showed that in the MI and CBGT groups, mean of BMI was significantly lower than control group. Also, it was found that, in the MI, the mean of HbA 1 c was significantly lower than CBGT intervention group. The results indicated that in helping adults with type 2 diabetes, CBGT and MI in group format may be useful interventions to improve their weight loss, and MI may be a useful intervention to improve their glycemic control than CBGT. Theoretical and practical implications of results are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This work {{looks into}} the {{potential}} use of various instruments which rely on a close interaction between different segments of society (the public, the private and the third sectors) for increasing low income urban land development in Brazil. It {{is based on the}} recognition that the Brazilian housing problem is <b>serious,</b> <b>threatening</b> the development and environment of urban centres in the country, being also intimately related to the difficult access to adequate land by {{a significant portion of the}} urban population. The central objective of this thesis is to analyse the possibility of using such instruments for increasing land access to low income groups in Brazil. The idea of exploring the theme of partnerships for urban land development as an alternative solution to low income groups has arisen from two main arguments: the recognition that neither sector alone has adequately managed to address the issue of housing for low income groups and, the urge for new roles to be performed by the public, the private and the third sectors. Based on the conclusions of the literature review and on the analysis of 4 Brazilian applications of partnership-based instruments, a framework to guide partnership arrangements is proposed, discussing the relevant elements to be addressed when working through partnerships. Finally, the conclusions point out the degree of viability and generalisation of partnership arrangements in the Brazilian context and the different aspects of the changes required for their success, while some recommendations are given (of both practical and theoretical nature) ...|$|E

PickeringAs the Internet is {{progressively}} {{integrated into}} industrial and defense-related networks around the globe, {{it is becoming}} increasingly important to understand how state and sub-state groups can use Internet vulnerabilities as a conduit of attack. The current social science literature on cyber threats is largely dominated by descriptive, U. S. -centric research. While this scholarship is important, the findings are not generalizable and fail to address the global aspects of network vulnerabilities. As a result, this dissertation employs a unique dataset of cyber threats from around the world, spanning from 1990 to 2011. This dataset allows for three diverse empirical studies to be conducted. The first study investigates the political, social, and economic characteristics that increase the likelihood of a state being targeted for cyber threats. The results show that different state characteristics are likely to influence the forms of digital attack targeting. For example, states that experience increases in GDP per capita and military size {{are more likely to be}} targeted for cyber attacks. Inversely, states that experience increases in GDP per capita and those that are more democratic are less likely to be targeted for cyber terrorism. The second study investigates the role that international rivalries play in cyber threat targeting. The results suggest that states in rivalries may have more reason to strengthen their digital security, and rival actors may be cautious about employing <b>serious,</b> <b>threatening</b> forms of cyber activity against foes because of concerns about escalation. The final study, based upon the crisis bargaining theory, seeks to determine if cyber threat targeting decreases private information asymmetry and therefore decreases conflict participation. Empirical results show that the loss of digital information via cyber means may thus illicit a low intensity threat or militarized action by a target state, but it also simultaneously increases the likelihood that a bargain may be researched, preventing full scale war by reducing the amount of private information held between parties...|$|E

On basis of the model, its epitomized model is formed to analyze the landslide mechanism and damage model by taking them into consideration: water-level fluctuation in reservoir, rainfall intensity, rainfall capacity and soil mass mechanical property, and decide current stability, predict its tendency and potential risks through applying the monitoring data and quantitative analysis.

40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} {{the effect of}} additional treatment with anti-TNF-alpha therapy in a case series of 13 patients with <b>serious</b> sight <b>threatening</b> uveitis. METHODS: 13 patients with <b>serious</b> sight <b>threatening</b> uveitis were included, of whom six had Behcet's disease, five had idiopathic posterior uveitis, one had sarcoidosis, and one birdshot retinochoroiditis. Onset and course of ocular inflammation, inflammatory signs, and visual acuity were assessed. Patients were treated with 200 mg (approximately 3 mg/kg) infliximab infusion. Repeat infusions were given based on clinical response. RESULTS: Infliximab treatment resulted in an effective suppression of ocular inflammation in all patients. In patients with non-Behcet's disease uveitis visual acuity in six out of eight improved or was stable. In patients with Behcet's disease visual acuity in five out of six improved or was stable. CONCLUSION: Anti-TNF-alpha treatment may be of value {{in the treatment of}} uveitis, and in patients with Behcet's disease, leading to suppression of ocular inflammation, vasculitis, and improvement of vision in the majority.
