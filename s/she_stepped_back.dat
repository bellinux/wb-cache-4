60|$|Startled, appalled, <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back,</b> {{her hand}} pressed to her {{tortured}} breast.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> {{into the}} house and the door closed behind her.|$|E
60|$|She made no reply, {{only she}} shivered {{a little as}} <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> into the sunshine.|$|E
5000|$|Cabinet Secretariat of National Security Agency {{information}} team. She went to {{the same}} university as Shindō and Asano. She is in love with Shindō, but realises that she [...] "isn't capable enough to handle him" [...] so <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> politely <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> {{to let him}} pass her, {{and then}} her father turned quickly to her.|$|R
50|$|Pygmalion, {{completing}} his statue of Galatea, is {{madly in love}} with it. To his delight, Galatea comes to life. When he tries to embrace her, however, she magically changes place; then her upper and lower halves come apart, much to Pygmalion's confusion. Galatea's halves join back together again, but just as he is about to kiss her at last, <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> <b>back</b> onto her pedestal and becomes a statue again.|$|R
60|$|She said {{it quite}} simply, without emotion. I moved towards her, thrilling, but <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> and bade them {{contemplate}} the empty drawing-room, with its rich, irregular lights, as the flames leapt and wavered.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy advanced, but <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> {{and stopped}} him. Then {{he turned and}} saw Mrs. Jardine wave to them from the stoop.|$|E
6000|$|... "None as I knows of. They are strangers here--only {{just came}} to the room. There it is," [...] <b>she</b> added, <b>stepping</b> <b>back</b> and {{pointing}} to an inner door.|$|R
50|$|Philly becomes {{infatuated}} with Nicole. When she spots him peeping into her room, {{she tells him}} to close her door. To Philly's utter shock, she means for him to close her door from the inside and then watch her undress. However, it {{is too much for}} him when a topless Nicole asks him to touch her breasts. When he objects, <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> <b>back</b> and instead takes off her panties. Philly panics and leaves.|$|R
5000|$|Eagle {{describes}} her painting preference as delving more deeply than surface appearance {{to offer a}} glimpse of an inner life. In two of her paintings, Self-portrait, and Blue, she pictures a moment in which <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> <b>back</b> from the easel, removes her glasses, and looks again literally and figuratively. She {{wants to make sure}} what she sees is how it actually appears. Eagle wants her paintings to say [...] "here I am, as I really am." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> {{to where}} Wingrave lay. He {{was in a}} {{recumbent}} position now and, although a little pale, he was obviously not seriously hurt.|$|E
60|$|My dearie stood {{straight}} up and the trembling left her. <b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back,</b> and I could see her face, white as the dead, but calm and resolved.|$|E
6000|$|He moved a {{step towards}} her, and <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back,</b> her white face {{struggled}} {{against him and}} resisted him. [...] "No," [...] she gasped. [...] "I cannot bear--. Go now." ...|$|E
60|$|I kissed her, {{and fell}} back with a cry that was of anguish almost--so poignantly had the sweet, fierce pain of that kiss run through my every fibre. And as I cried out, so too did <b>she,</b> <b>stepping</b> <b>back,</b> her hands {{suddenly}} to her face. But the next moment she was peering up at {{the windows of the}} house--those inscrutable eyes that looked upon our deed; that looked and of which it was impossible to discern how much they might have seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then," [...] he said, [...] "I am {{to take it}} {{that silence}} gives consent." [...] And he laughed nervously, with nervous anticipation, {{as he tried to}} put his arm round her. But <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> {{suddenly}} <b>back.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> took a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> and {{surveyed}} {{him from the}} feet to the face. Their eyes met and locked for a moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Move then!" [...] Gomez {{commanded}} harshly; {{and when}} <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> her dress uncovered the ring. Its setting was of small emeralds and diamonds, and might {{easily have been}} crushed.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> again, {{leaning against}} the rock. The {{moonlight}} shone full upon her face. There was terror as well as astonishment in her eyes while they now looked at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed we must," [...] said Mrs. Colesworthy, and as <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> {{from the}} door, she whispered in my ear: [...] "Not a look, not a tremble {{to let him}} know!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>stepping</b> <b>back,</b> {{with her}} hands still locked behind her. [...] "Stay where you are. There! That's enough!" [...] She drew herself up and let her hands fall at her side. [...] "Now, let us speak of Jim," [...] she said coldly.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2014 Kelle {{announced}} that <b>she</b> would be <b>stepping</b> <b>back</b> from Eternal to focus on her talent agency and acting career.|$|R
60|$|On {{my mother}} {{appearing}} {{in a new}} bonnet, or an old one retrimmed, an event not unfrequent; for in these days my mother took more thought than ever formerly for her appearance (you will understand, you women who have loved), <b>she</b> would <b>step</b> <b>back</b> in simulated amazement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a whit, my dear; no {{exemption}} here;" [...] {{and there}} was a horse laugh, and an endeavour to seize her, as <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back,</b> feeling that in quietness lay her best chance of repelling them, adding-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> {{again before}} I could attempt to answer, and next instant with a hideous, {{concentrated}} effort, Oro bending himself double, thrust upon the rod, as I {{could see from}} his open mouth, shouting while he thrust.|$|E
6000|$|... "Magdalen, {{have you}} {{nothing to say}} to me?" [...] he asked, coming closer to her with an imploring passion in his face never seen by Marian Lesley's eyes. He reached out his hand, but <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> from his touch.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> had <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> {{into the}} room at sight of him, for {{obviously}} something very much amiss must have occurred thus to ruffle Hector's ingrained dignity, and even M. le Comte was involuntarily dragged out of his aristocratic aloofness and almost--though not quite--jumped up from his chair.|$|R
50|$|In 2015 Heather Nedohin {{announced}} <b>she</b> {{would be}} <b>stepping</b> <b>back</b> {{from the game}} and that Chelsea Carey, formerly of Manitoba, would be taking over her current team.|$|R
60|$|I stopped, awed. For <b>she</b> had <b>stepped</b> <b>back,</b> {{out on the}} balcony. She hid {{her head}} in her hands, and I saw her breast shaken as with sobs. I waited what seemed a day,--a year. Then she raised her face and looked at me through the tears shining in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry to}} part with you so soon," [...] she said, as <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> a pace or two with folded hands. [...] "Of course every moment of your time now is occupied. You must not think of wasting it on me." ...|$|E
6000|$|In her {{agitation}} {{she touched}} the bell. Half frightened at what she had done, <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> and sat down. In a few minutes there was a knock, the door opened, a servant entered. [...] "Bring me a cup of tea," [...] said Mrs. Cliff.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back,</b> {{her eyes}} {{expanded}} and her lower jaw dropped. [...] "Your bear!" [...] she cried, {{and with that}} her glance seemed to run all over me {{as if she were}} trying to find some resemblance to a man who exhibited a bear.|$|E
5000|$|Stunned by the {{realization}} of deceit, she moves back in hushed disbelief while her mother fumbles for repentance. <b>She</b> <b>steps</b> <b>back</b> little by little against the wall as she whimpers in stupor, “Hayup! Hayup! Hayup!”, while the camera pans up close capturing the depth, breadth of pain, humiliation, shock, and quiet rage all over her face[...].It is an electrifying gamut of emotion on screen that triggers complete silence in the theater as if everybody stops breathing. I still have to see one actress who can pull a scene so moving yet in its blend of dignity and tenderness as well as silent rage. It leaves an indelible mark as the greatest acting highlight… FAMAS Review ...|$|R
50|$|In 2011, she {{was named}} by CNBC {{as one of the}} 12 most popular stars in porn. CNBC noted that while <b>she</b> had <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> from acting to pursue {{directing}} and producing, she has maintained a loyal fan base, and has been nominated for 42 AVN awards and won 10 in the course of her career.|$|R
60|$|My {{father looked}} round quickly, and {{discovered}} Dame Dermody facing {{him in the}} full light of the window. <b>She</b> had <b>stepped</b> <b>back,</b> {{at the outset of}} the dispute, into the corner behind the fireplace. There she had remained, biding her time to speak, until my father's last threat brought her out of her place of retirement.|$|R
