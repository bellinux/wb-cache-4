30|$|The <b>spillage</b> rate {{per patient}} was 53.8 % (14 / 26), but the total <b>spillage</b> rate was 45 % (14 / 31) for all cysts removed. <b>Spillage</b> rate varied with removal method: 10 / 14 (71.4 %) for {{enucleation}} and removal via the trocar sleeve without endobag pouch; 1 / 10 (10 %) for removal of cysts within the endobag; and 3 / 7 (42.8 %) in the colpotomy group. In the LAVH case, no <b>spillage</b> occurred. Surprisingly, <b>spillage</b> was not correlated with cyst size. Mean ± standard deviation (SD) cyst diameter was 5.4 [*]±[*] 2.1  cm and 5.7 [*]±[*] 2.3  cm for spilled and unspilled cysts, respectively (P[*]>[*] 0.05).|$|R
30|$|The {{use of a}} laparoscopic {{approach}} for ovarian cysts with suspicious features is controversial owing to concerns related to potential <b>spillage</b> of the cyst contents into the peritoneal cavity. <b>Spillage</b> of dermoid cyst material can lead to an extensive inflammatory reaction, resulting {{in the formation of}} peritoneal adhesions, while <b>spillage</b> from a mucinous cyst may result in pseudomyxoma peritonei [19]. In the case of a malignant cyst, <b>spillage</b> of its contents can result in the intraperitoneal dissemination of malignant cells and thereby advance the stage of the disease [20].|$|R
30|$|The laparoscopic {{removal of}} dermoid cysts {{has been shown}} to be safe, with most {{patients}} discharged the same day [3, 4]. The most significant potential complication of dermoid cyst removal is chemical peritonitis resulting from <b>spillage.</b> Although the rate of <b>spillage</b> during laparoscopic removal is approximately 27 % [5], the incidence of clinical peritonitis following <b>spillage</b> during laparoscopy is estimated at only 0.2 % [4].|$|R

25|$|Diesel-powered {{vehicles}} {{can often}} transition completely to biodiesel, though the fuel {{is a very}} strong solvent, which can occasionally damage rubber seals in vehicles built before 1994. More commonly, however, biodiesel causes problems simply because it removes all of the built-up residue in an engine, clogging filters, unless care is taken when switching from dirty fossil-fuel derived diesel to bio-diesel. It is very effective at 'de-coking' the diesel engines combustion chambers and keeping them clean. Biodiesel is the lowest emission fuel available for diesel engines. Diesel engines are the most efficient car internal combustion engines. Biodiesel is the only fuel allowed in some North American national parks because <b>spillages</b> will completely bio-degrade within 21 days. Biodiesel and vegetable oil fuelled, diesel engined vehicles have been declared amongst the greenest in the US Tour de Sol competition.|$|E
25|$|In milling, the {{incoming}} graphite products and concentrates can be ground before being classified (sized or screened), with the coarser flake size fractions (below 8 mesh, 8–20 mesh, 20–50 mesh) carefully preserved, {{and then the}} carbon contents are determined. Some standard blends can be prepared from the different fractions, each with a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. Custom blends can also be made for individual customers who want a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. If flake size is unimportant, the concentrate can be ground more freely. Typical end products include a fine powder {{for use as a}} slurry in oil drilling and coatings for foundry molds, carbon raiser in the steel industry (Synthetic graphite powder and powdered petroleum coke can also be used as carbon raiser). Environmental impacts from graphite mills consist of air pollution including fine particulate exposure of workers and also soil contamination from powder <b>spillages</b> leading to heavy metal contamination of soil.|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{examine the}} effect of oil <b>spillage</b> on cassava farm land, yield and land productivity. Place and Duration of Study: Niger Delta region of Nigeria between January and October, 2012. Methodology: Delta State was purposively chosen from the Niger Delta region for the study. A random {{sampling}} technique was employed to select 17 cassava farmers each from three (3) oil <b>spillage</b> communities (Otor-Udu, Olomoro and Uzere) and three (3) nonoil <b>spillage</b> communities (Egini, Aradhe and Ellu), giving a total sample size of 102 respondents for the study. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics, Likert scale, t-statistic and regression analysis. Results: The results showed that the major significant effects of oil <b>spillage</b> on cassava production perceived by the farmers included crop failure, poor yield, rotting tubers, and stunted crop growth with mean scores of 4. 80, 4. 78, 4. 75 and 4. 75 respectively. Others included increased soil temperature and toxicity (mean: 4. 73), reduction of soil fertility (mean: 4. 70), degradation of farm land (mean: 4. 70) and low land productivity (mean: 4. 70). The results further indicated that the cassava farm size, yield and land productivity in oil <b>spillage</b> affected communities were significantly (p < 0. 01) lower than those of the nonoil <b>spillage</b> communities by 0. 61 ha, 6119 metric tonnes (MT) and 1447 MT/ha respectively. These represent significant reduction of 36, 48 and 20 % of these variables in the oil <b>spillage</b> affected communities respectively. About 45 % of the variation in land productivity in cassava production was influenced by oil <b>spillage</b> and the farmers’ farming experience. The productivity increased with increase in farming experience but decreased with increase in oil spills. Conclusion: Constant maintenance of the oil pipelines and tankers to prevent corrosion and checking of the activities of saboteurs which often destroy oil pipelines will reduce the incidence of oil <b>spillage,</b> hence increasing cassava production in the Niger Delta region. There is need for further study to know the adaptation measures the farmers employed to minimize the adverse effects of oil <b>spillage</b> on their production; and the mitigating measures by government and the oil companies to deal with oil <b>spillage...</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{found that}} <b>spillage</b> during {{enucleation}} of the cyst or during retrieval {{did not affect}} prognosis. In fact, in cases in which postoperative spontaneous pregnancy (3 / 5) were reported, <b>spillage</b> of cyst contents had occurred during the surgery.|$|R
30|$|The risk of <b>spillage</b> during {{removal of}} dermoid cysts is {{independent}} of age, operative technique or cyst size [6]. Concomitant oophorectomy, however, does reduce the chance of <b>spillage,</b> as does surgeon experience when laparoscopy, but not laparotomy, is performed.|$|R
25|$|Toilet {{paper is}} a soft paper product (tissue paper) used to {{maintain}} personal hygiene after human defecation or urination. However, {{it can also}} be used for other purposes such as absorbing <b>spillages</b> or craft projects. Toilet paper in different forms has been used for centuries, namely in China. The ancient Greeks used clay and stone; the Romans, sponges and salt water. But according to a CNN article, the idea of a commercial product designed solely to wipe a person's buttocks was by New York City entrepreneur Joseph Gayetty, who in 1857, invented aloe-infused sheets of manila hemp dispensed from Kleenex-like boxes. However, Gayetty's toilet paper was a failure for several reasons. Americans soon grew accustomed to wiping with the Sears Roebuck catalog, they saw no need to spend money on toilet paper when catalogs for their use came in the mail for free, and because during the 19th century, it was a social taboo to openly discuss bathroom hygiene with others. Toilet paper took its next leap forward in 1890, when two brothers named Clarence and E. Irvin Scott of the Scott Paper Company co-invented rolled toilet paper.|$|E
500|$|The A6 {{motorway}} mainly {{runs through}} the mountainous Gorski Kotar region, requiring not only large bridges and viaducts and long tunnels along the route, but also special care must be paid to protection of the environment, as the route is located in karst terrain, with numerous water supply protection zones and significant natural heritage. Risnjak National Park is located near the A6 route, and is accessed via the Delnice interchange. Due to the motorway access and its proximity {{to a number of}} seaside resorts, Risnjak is the most visited national park in Croatia. Karst terrain is especially susceptible to water pollution, so the A6 motorway is equipped with a closed water drainage system designed to channel rainwater, meltwater, and any <b>spillages</b> to purpose-built processing facilities.

Conservative surgical approach with the least chance of adhesions is demanding to preserve future fertility. There is a common belief among gynecologic surgeons that <b>spillage</b> of cyst contents potentially leading to complications such as chemical peritonitis or spread of infection is the most important risk in laparoscopic management of dermoid cysts. <b>Spillage</b> rates in laparoscopy are 15 − 100 % [4 – 16] compared with only 4 – 13 %) via laparotomy [11 – 13].

40|$|Active {{deposition}} {{across the}} floodplains of large rivers arises {{through a variety}} of processes; collectively these are here termed ‘spillage sedimentation’. Three groups of eleven <b>spillage</b> sedimentation styles are identified and their formative processes described. Form presences on large river floodplains show different combinations of active <b>spillage</b> styles. Only some large floodplains have prominent levees; some have coarse splays; many have accessory channel dispersion and reworking, whilst still-water sedimentation in lacustrine environments dominates some lower reaches. Infills are also commonly funnelled into prior, and often linear, negative relief forms relating to former migration within the mainstream channel belt. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Landsat 8 data are used to map <b>spillage</b> form types and coverage along a 1700 km reach of the Amazon that has an active floodplain width of up to 110 km with a systematic character transformation down-valley. <b>Spillage</b> forms associated directly with mainstream processes rarely account for more than 5 % of the floodplain deposits. There is a marked decrease in floodplain point bar complexes (PBC) over 1700 km downstream (from 34 % to 5 %), and an increase in the prevalence of large water bodies (2 % to 37 %) and accompanying internal crevasses and deltas (0 % to 5 %). <b>Spillage</b> sedimentation is likely within the negative relief associated with these forms, depending on mainstream sediment-laden floodwater inputs. <b>Spillage</b> style dominance depends on the balance between sediment loadings, hydrological sequencing, and morphological opportunity. Down river form sequences are likely to follow gradient change, prior up-river sediment sequestration and the altered nature of spilled loads, but also crucially, local floodplain relief and incident water levels and velocities at <b>spillage</b> times. Considering style distribution quantitatively, as a spatially distributed set of identifiable forms, emphasises the global variety to <b>spillage</b> phenomena along and between large rivers...|$|R

30|$|Apart from {{sporadic}} case reports, {{review of}} the literature revealed a total of 14 studies documenting 470 laparoscopic dermoid cystectomies. <b>Spillage</b> occurred in 310 cases (66 %). The significant postoperative complications were seen in only one case [11], with chronic granulomatous peritonitis occurring 9 months postoperatively. However, in some of these studies, {{there was no mention of}} precaution techniques to avoid <b>spillage</b> or measures to clean up the pelvis after surgery. We presume that sticking to the rule of jet-wash irrigation with copious amounts of fluid, removing up to microscopic particles of cyst contents, is the gold standard to avoid complications. Importantly, there was no significant difference in complication rates between the <b>spillage</b> and nonspillage groups in our study. Additionally, cyst size had no impact on <b>spillage</b> rate.

30|$|Most {{operative}} textbooks describe classic {{treatment for}} dermoid cysts as ovarian cystectomy or oophorectomy through laparotomy, with utmost care necessary to avoid <b>spillage</b> of cyst contents. Although laparoscopic surgery has replaced many standard laparotomy techniques, many skeptical opinions remained about role of laparoscopic surgery for dermoid cyst removal. The potential fear of <b>spillage</b> of cyst material and possible development of chemical peritonitis imposed fears about adopting the laparoscopic approach [4, 9]. The phobia of <b>spillage</b> complications existed until recently challenged by many laparoscopists [4, 9].
