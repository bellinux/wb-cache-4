30|$|However, {{very often}} some {{subjects}} {{are not able}} to spontaneously expectorate sputum. Alternately, sputum induction with inhalation of hypertonic <b>saline</b> <b>mist</b> has been used to obtain adequate sputum samples [17, 18]. Yet the approach is limited by laborious and time consuming, need for specialized equipment, and the risk of bronchospasm and respiratory inflammation. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop a safe, simple, and efficient means for efficiently and safely collecting sputum.|$|E
30|$|Our {{study also}} shows that the {{assessment}} of the miRNAs in Lung Flute-collected sputum produces a higher sensitivity compared with conventional sputum cytology. Furthermore, combined use of the miRNA biomarkers and cytological analysis in the sputum specimens has synergetic efficiency for diagnosis of lung cancer demonstrated by a considerably higher sensitivity compared with each approach used alone. Therefore, the small device could provide a potential tool to facilitate diagnosis of lung cancer through analysis of sputum. The Lung Flute-collected sputum specimens might also have the potential to be used for studying other forms of biomarkers in the early detection of lung cancer. For example, methylations and mutations of lung cancer-related genes could be examined by PCR, or genomic aberrations of lung cancer-related genes by fluorescence in situ hybridization in the specimens [8, 9, 22]. We will undertake a project to compare performance characteristics of the miRNAs to that of the previously developed biomarkers using Lung Flute-obtained sputum specimens. We are carrying out a study in a large population-based case–control study to validate the performance of Lung Flute, compare the efficiency between Lung Flute and sputum induction with inhalation of hypertonic <b>saline</b> <b>mist,</b> and evaluate the contraindication to the Lung Flute.|$|E
40|$|Sputum {{induction}} {{by inhalation}} of hypertonic saline {{has been used}} for more than 15 years. It {{has become one of the}} most intriguing methods to study airway inflammation. It is the only direct, non-invasive method for measuring airway inflammation indices. Sputum induction has been used in the diagnosis of many respiratory illnesses including asthma, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, tuberculosis, chronic cough, lung cancer and Pneumocystis Carinii on patients who are unable to produce sputum spontaneously. There are currently many different methods used worldwide to induce sputum, but there is a lack of one generally accepted gold standard method. The proposed protocols for sputum induction proved to be safe, simple and produced satisfactory amount of expectorate. However, it did not contain enough cells from the lower respiratory tract and was contaminated by squamous cells when compared to another method based on the work of F. E. Hargreave. Investigation demonstrated that the use of impulse oscillometry, which requires no effort from patients, needs further research with larger study samples before it could be used instead of spirometry to evaluate airway obstruction. Initial methylene blue stain of the fresh expectorate smear was shown to be useful tool for identifying grossly contaminated sputum samples by squamous epithelial cells. Our first study group included 20 volunteers in good health. Sputum was induced by inhalation of 3 % <b>saline</b> <b>mist</b> created by ultrasonic nebulizer at maximum output (4 ml/min). Sputum induction intervals lasted 4 - 5 minutes with cumulative duration of induction about 4 - 15 minutes which was tolerated well. Lung function was evaluated for obstruction at baseline and every 5 minutes with spirometry and impulse oscillometry. The whole expectorated sample was processed and slides were stained with HEMA 3 stain. With this method we were able to collect a mean of 6. 1 ml expectorate...|$|E

40|$|A borracha de {{silicone}} (SR) vem sendo utilizada em isoladores nas linhas de transmissão de energia elétrica e por esta razão, torna-se importante o estudo de sua estabilidade térmica, já que este é um dos fatores que afeta a vida útil do polímero. Este estudo tem como objetivo avaliar o(s) revestimento(s) de borracha de silicone utilizada em isoladores poliméricos que foram submetidos a diferentes tipos de envelhecimentos acelerados tais como névoa salina, temperatura a 120 °C, Weatherometer e imersão em água. Os isoladores com invólucros de SR foram envelhecidos e caracterizados quanto às propriedades térmicas por Análise termogravimetrica - TGA e calorimetria diferencial de varredura - DSC, a sua morfologia (por microscopia eletrônica de varredura - MEV) e espectroscopia de infravermelho (FTIR-ATR), sendo comparados com uma amostra não envelhecida. Por estas análises se observa que quanto mais agressivo for o ambiente maior é sua degradação. Os valores de resistência à tração também se observam uma degradação maior a amostra envelhecida termicamente a 140 ºC. Para investigar a cinética de degradação térmica do material polimérico foi realizado envelhecimento térmico {{no material}} não envelhecido e envelhecido a temperatura de 140 ºC (durante seis meses em estufa com circulação de ar). Tal estudo foi realizado utilizando a técnica Termogravimétrica (TGA). A análise cinética foi realizada utilizando o método de Flaynn-Wall-Ozawa e foi possível observar que após o envelhecimento ocorreu uma leve degradação. Foram comparados os resultados de energia de ativação (Ea) e ordem de reação (n) das amostras novas e após o envelhecimento. The silicone rubber (SR) {{has been used}} in insulators on the lines of transmission of electric energy and for this reason, it is important to study their thermal stability, since {{this is one of the}} factors that affect the life of the polymer. This study aims to evaluate the (s) coating (s) of silicone rubber used in polymeric insulators that were submitted to different types of accelerated aging such as <b>saline</b> <b>mist,</b> temperature to 120 °C, Weatherometer and immersion in water. The isolators with SR coating were aged and characterized on the thermal properties by thermogravimetric analysis - TGA and differential scanning calorimetric - DSC, the morphology (by scanning electron microscopy - SEM) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), and compared with a sample is aged. For this analysis it is observed that the more aggressive environment is the greater its degradation. The value of tensile strength is also observed a higher degradation the sample thermally aged at 140 ° C. To investigate the kinetics of thermal degradation of polymer material thermal aging was conducted on material not aged and aged at a temperature of 140 ºC (for six months in the oven with circulating air). This study was performed using the technique Thermogravimetric (TGA). The kinetic analysis was performed using the Flaynn-Wall-Ozawa and it was possible to observe that after the aging was a slight degradation. We compared the results of the activation energy (Ea) and order of reaction (n) of new samples and after aging...|$|E
