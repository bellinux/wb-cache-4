5|$|Based on his {{industry}} {{experience on}} Air Force missile projects, Mueller realized some skilled managers {{could be found}} among high-ranking officers in the United States Air Force, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> Webb's permission to recruit General Samuel C. Phillips, who gained a reputation for his effective management of the Minuteman program, as OMSF program controller. Phillips' superior officer Bernard A. Schriever agreed to loan Phillips to NASA, along {{with a staff of}} officers under him, on the condition that Phillips be made Apollo Program Director. Mueller agreed, and Phillips managed Apollo from January 1964, until it achieved the first manned landing in July 1969, after which he returned to Air Force duty.|$|E
5|$|When Ohno {{was very}} young, his father meticulously {{researched}} childcare providers {{to care for}} his son during his long work hours. As he grew older, his father became concerned his son would become a latchkey kid, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> his son involved with competitive swimming and quad-speed roller skating at age 6. He later switched from the instruction of Benton Redford, a National Champion, to a team in Federal Way, WA called Pattisons Team Extreme and became a national inline speedskating champion and record holder himself. His father used Inline Speedskating to fill his spare time. Ohno's days were spent with morning swimming practices, followed by schooling, and finally skating practices in the afternoon.|$|E

25|$|A {{short time}} after Hatteras Island was {{captured}} for the Union, Burnside began {{to promote the}} idea of a Coast Division, to be composed of fishermen, dockworkers, and other watermen from the northeastern states, and used to attack coastal areas. He reasoned that such men were already familiar with ships, and therefore would be easy to train for amphibious operations. Burnside was a close friend of General-in-Chief George B. McClellan, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a respectful hearing. Although Burnside had initially intended to operate in Chesapeake Bay, in the hands of McClellan and the War Department his ideas were soon transformed into a planned assault on the North Carolina interior coast, beginning with Roanoke Island. An unspoken reason for the change of target was the mistaken belief that pro-Union sentiment was being suppressed in North Carolina, and an invasion would allow them to express their true loyalties. When it was fleshed out, the invasion of North Carolina {{came to be known as}} the Burnside Expedition.|$|E

500|$|The game uses {{graphics}} and animation as vehicles of characterization. Donkey Kong smirks upon Mario's demise. Pauline has a pink dress and long hair, and a speech balloon crying [...] "HELP!" [...] appears frequently beside her. Mario, depicted in red overalls {{and a red}} cap, is an everyman character, a type common in Japan. Graphical limitations and the low pixel resolution of the small sprites prompted his design: drawing a mouth was infeasible, so the character was given a mustache; the programmers could not animate hair, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a cap; and to make his arm movements visible, he needed colored overalls. The artwork used for the cabinets and promotional materials make these cartoon-like character designs even more explicit. Pauline, for example, is depicted to be disheveled (like King Kong Fay Wray) in a torn dress and stiletto heels.|$|E

He battled proponents of the Sunshine State Parkway in Florida. As it was constructed parallel to designated Interstate routes, it threatened to draw off traffic and make the highways unfeasible.

2500|$|... 2) Another story aims {{to portray}} Ashoka as an evil person {{in order to}} convey the {{importance}} of his transformation into a good person upon adopting Buddhism. It begins by stating that due to Ashoka’s physical ugliness he was disliked by his father Bindusara. Ashoka wanted to become king and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> rid of the heir by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals. He became famous as “Ashoka the Fierce” because of his wicked nature and bad temper.

He is said to have burnt his entire harem to death when certain women insulted him. He is supposed to have derived sadistic pleasure from watching other people suffer. And for this he built himself an elaborate and horrific torture chamber where he amused himself [...] by torturing other people. The story then goes on to narrate how it was only after an encounter with a pious Buddhist monk that Ashoka himself transformed into “Ashoka the pious”.
