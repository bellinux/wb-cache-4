25|$|The Cell has no {{moving parts}} and no {{requirement}} for compressed air or <b>sparging</b> mechanisms. This results in lower power consumption than the equivalent mechanical or column flotation cells. Maintenance costs are also lower {{because the only}} wearing part is the slurry lens used to create the jet in the downcomer.|$|E
25|$|In the {{processing}} of edible oils, the oil is heated under vacuum to near the smoke point, and water is introduced {{at the bottom of}} the oil. The water immediately is converted to steam, which bubbles through the oil, carrying with it any chemicals which are water-soluble. The steam <b>sparging</b> removes impurities that can impart unwanted flavors and odors to the oil. Deodorization is key to the manufacture of vegetable oils. Nearly all soybean, corn, and canola oils found on supermarket shelves go through a deodorization stage that removes trace amounts of odors and flavors, and lightens the color of the oil.|$|E
40|$|The current {{flowsheet}} for the Am/Cm program {{requires that}} the glass pool be <b>sparged</b> with argon during the soaking period immediately prior to draining the melter. The effect of varying <b>sparge</b> rate and duration on the homogeneity of the final glass product was evaluated using the full scale 5 -inch Cylindrical Induction Melter (CIM 5) pilot facility. The tests showed that the homogeneity of the glass product is maintained provided the <b>sparge</b> rate is at least 1. 5 scfh and the <b>sparge</b> duration is at least 45 minutes or the flowrate is at least 1. 0 scfh and the <b>sparge</b> duration is 60 minutes. SRTC recommends that the melt pool be <b>sparged</b> for 75 minutes with an argon flowrate of 1. 5 scfh and a <b>sparge</b> dip tube located 1 -inch from the melter bottom.

40|$|A {{discrete}} bubble model (DBM) {{has been}} used to study the effect of gas <b>sparger</b> properties on the hydrodynamics in a bubble column. As a first step the performance of the model was evaluated by comparison with experimental data. Subsequently, four different perforated plates with different <b>sparged</b> areas were used as a gas <b>sparger.</b> Distributions of liquid velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, and void fraction in the central plane were compared for the four different systems. Furthermore, the effect of the <b>sparger</b> location was also investigated. It was found that the liquid-phase circulation becomes more pronounced as the <b>sparged</b> area location is more distant {{from the center of the}} bottom plate. Finally, gas-phase residence time distributions (RTD) were obtained from the simulations. By employing standard axial dispersion model, the gas-phase mixing in the bubble column was characterized. Results show that the extent of mixing increased when the <b>sparged</b> area decreased. The axial dispersion coefficient increased as the <b>sparged</b> area was shifted to the edge of the bottom plate...|$|R
25|$|Pollutants and {{contaminants}} can {{be removed}} from ground water by applying various techniques thereby making it safe for use. Ground water treatment (or remediation) techniques span biological, chemical, and physical treatment technologies. Most ground water treatment techniques utilize a combination of technologies. Some of the biological treatment techniques include bioaugmentation, bioventing, biosparging, bioslurping, and phytoremediation. Some chemical treatment techniques include ozone and oxygen gas injection, chemical precipitation, membrane separation, ion exchange, carbon absorption, aqueous chemical oxidation, and surfactant enhanced recovery.

500|$|The sweet wort {{collected}} from <b>sparging</b> {{is put into}} a kettle, or [...] "copper" [...] (so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper), and boiled, usually for about one hour. During boiling, water in the wort evaporates, but the sugars and other components of the wort remain; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer. Boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes {{left over from the}} mashing stage. Hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness, flavour and aroma. Hops may be added at more than one point during the boil. The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they contribute, but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer.|$|E

50|$|There must be {{a system}} for {{introducing}} <b>sparge</b> water into the lauter tun. Most systems have a ring of spray heads that ensure an even and gentle introduction of the <b>sparge</b> water. The watering system should not beat down on the grain bed and form a channel.|$|R
2500|$|For the {{analysis}} of volatile compounds, a purge and trap (P) concentrator system {{may be used to}} introduce samples. [...] The target analytes are extracted and mixed with water and introduced into an airtight chamber. [...] An inert gas such as Nitrogen (N2) is bubbled through the water; this is known as purging or <b>sparging.</b> [...] The volatile compounds move into the headspace above the water and are drawn along a pressure gradient (caused by the introduction of the purge gas) out of the chamber. [...] The volatile compounds are drawn along a heated line onto a 'trap'. [...] The trap is a column of adsorbent material at ambient temperature that holds the compounds by returning them to the liquid phase. [...] The trap is then heated and the sample compounds are introduced to the GC-MS column via a volatiles interface, which is a split inlet system. [...] P GC-MS is particularly suited to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and BTEX compounds (aromatic compounds associated with petroleum).|$|E
50|$|The grains are {{infused with}} yet hotter water to rinse more sugars from the mash {{in a process}} known as <b>sparging.</b> There are two types of <b>sparging.</b> Fly <b>sparging</b> and batch <b>sparging.</b> Fly <b>sparging</b> {{involves}} rinsing the grain bed by adding small amounts of hot water to the top while draining equal amounts from the bottom. Batch <b>sparging</b> involves adding all or most of your sparge water at one time to the grain bed and slowly draining it from the bottom. The <b>sparging</b> process will also stop any further enzymatic activity if much hotter water is used; conversely the mash may be heated to around 80 C to end such activity prior to placing it in the lauter-tun, and to prevent cooler grain from lowering the sparge water temperature to a lower than desirable figure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sparging</b> is {{trickling}} water through the grain to extract sugars. This {{is a delicate}} step, as the wrong temperature or pH will extract tannins from the chaff (grain husks) as well, resulting in a bitter brew. Typically, 1.5 times more water is used for <b>sparging</b> than was for mashing. <b>Sparging</b> is typically conducted in a lauter tun.|$|E
40|$|Resolution of the {{aeration}} {{requirements of}} Brucella suis in broth culture was imperative {{for the production}} of the comparatively large amounts of cells re-quired in the extensive epidemiological and immunological project of which this study is a part. The two prime factors in <b>sparger</b> aeration appeared to be (1) the rate of air supply and (2) the type of <b>sparger</b> employed; the two factors apparently were interdependent. Thus, the more efficient the <b>sparger</b> in pro-ducing fine bubbles, in general the less air required for growth. This has been emphasized in a review of biological aeration systems by De Becge and Liebmann (1944). In the case of this organism, however, the kinds of antifoam employed with various <b>sparger</b> aeration systems has also been found to be of primary importance. A typical industrial type stainless steel "dishpan " <b>sparger</b> has 0. 108 -inch perforations, 49 per square inch; whereas, in contrast, one of the more efficient industrial type heat-resistant carbon spargers (grade no. 60) has an average porosity of 0. 0013 inches.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Simulations of aerated stirred reactor is {{performed}} {{using a combination of}} large eddy simulation (LES) and Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT). A single impeller Rushton turbine is positioned {{at the center of the}} reactor and air is introduced at the bottom through a circular <b>sparger.</b> Effects of the gas volume flow, stirrer speed and <b>sparger</b> dimension are investigated. The results show that the time averaged liquid velocities in radial and tangential directions decrease with increasing gas volume fraction. In the axial direction, the gas redirects the radial jet upwards, breaking the symmetry of the ring vortices. Especially, for a narrower <b>sparger,</b> a more concentrated tilt upwards is observed with a larger region of negative axial velocity. Although, low aeration number is used, the periodicity from the impeller is decreasing and interfering with the creation of the trailing vortex pair.

50|$|Fly <b>sparging</b> (or German <b>sparging),</b> {{which is}} used by {{commercial}} breweries and many homebrewers, uses continuous process <b>sparging.</b> When the wort reaches a desired level (typically about 1 in) above the grainbed, water is added at the same slow rate that wort is being drained. The wort gradually becomes weaker and weaker, and at a certain point, they stop adding water. This results in greater yields.|$|E
50|$|English <b>sparging</b> (or batch <b>sparging)</b> drains the wort {{completely}} {{from the}} mash, after which more water is added, held {{for a while}} at 76 C and then drained again. The second draining {{can be used in}} making a lighter-bodied low-alcohol beer known as small beer, or can be added to the first draining. Some homebrewers use English <b>sparging,</b> except that the second batch of water is only held long enough for the grain bed to settle, after which recirculation and draining occurs.|$|E
5000|$|In chemistry, <b>sparging,</b> {{also known}} as gas {{flushing}} in metallurgy, is a technique which involves bubbling a chemically inert gas, such as nitrogen, argon, or helium, through a liquid. This {{can be used to}} remove dissolved gases (e.g. oxygen) from the liquid. By Henry's Law, the amount of dissolved gases in a liquid depend on the partial pressure of the gases exposed to the liquid. <b>Sparging</b> increases the gas-liquid interface.|$|E

5|$|Most modern breweries use a {{continuous}} <b>sparge,</b> collecting the original wort and the <b>sparge</b> water together. However, {{it is possible}} to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches. Each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer. This process is known as second (and third) runnings. Brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing.|$|R
40|$|Rigid {{spargers}} {{are enjoying}} {{renewed interest in}} some flotation column applications such as de-inking of recycled paper and de-oiling of water. <b>Sparger</b> selection depends on the physical characteristics of the porous material, the liquid/slurry properties, and {{the dimensions of the}} column. There is no generally accepted method to select spargers for a given flotation column duty. A methodology for selecting stainless steel rigid spargers is proposed. The methodology is based on a target bubble size (db), gas holdup (epsilong), or bubble surface flux (Sb). It combines two models: one for bubble formation at the <b>sparger</b> proposed by Kumar and Kuloor which relates bubble size to <b>sparger</b> characteristics, and drift flux analysis which relates mean bubble size, gas holdup, and gas rate. Prediction of bubble size by the Kumar and Kuloor model requires a knowledge of an equivalent pore diameter (De) of the <b>sparger.</b> A procedure to estimate De by fitting the predicted and measured epsilong - Jg relationships is developed. Comparison of bubble size measured photographically with that estimated from drift flux analysis, and predicted by the Kumar and Kuloor model shows acceptable agreement between the measured, estimated and predicted values. By combining db predicted with drift flux analysis, and allowing for column dimensions, both the gas holdup and the bubble surface flux were predicted. A maximum in <b>sparger</b> surface area was found above which the gas holdup and the bubble surface flux do not increase. Spargers were characterized according to their permeability (k), by applying the Darcy law. <b>Sparger</b> homogeneity was established from this permeability measurement. A relationship between De and k was derived. For spargers with permeability up to 0. 75 darcy (0. 75 x 10 - 5 m 2), the equivalent pore diameter was constant (De = 2 mum). For larger permeabilities De increased with permeability. Application of the <b>sparger</b> selection criteria in a pilot unit (0. 5 m diameter column) showed epsilong and Sb can be predicted with acceptable accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract−The bubble {{properties}} in the column flotation system are deeply affected by the bubble-generator type, frother dosage, and superficial gas velocity. This study {{is to determine the}} bubble-generator type, which effectively produces micro-bubbles to affect the flotation efficiency. Characteristics for two types of bubble generators like the in-line mixer and <b>sparger</b> are examined by bubble properties such as bubble diameter, holdup and bubble velocity. Micro bubbles generated from an in-line mixer result in the increase of the bubble rising velocity and gas holdup. Bubbles produced at the in-line mixer were more effective for operating the flotation system than that of the <b>sparger.</b> It means that the in-line mixer bubble generator is more effective than a <b>sparger</b> in designing or operating the column flotation system...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Strained carrot quality is impacted by color degradation and flavor changes. Maceration, followed by heating in open holding tanks may cause chemical changes that lead to brown color formation. Processing carrots in low oxygen environments may result in better color and flavor retention after processing and during storage. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate mechanisms for loss of strained carrot quality and to determine chemical attributes responsible for improved carrot color and flavor. Chemical and sensory attributes were evaluated for ten genotypes. Additional thermal processing treatments included a control (21 % 02) nitrogen (N 2) <b>sparge,</b> blanch/freeze/nitrogen <b>sparge</b> (BFN 2), oxygen (02) <b>sparge</b> and glucose oxidase-catalase (GOC). Samples were stored for various times and temperatures and monitored periodically for chemical and sensory attributes. Changes in color, soluble phenolics, carotenoids, molecular weight, sugars and pH were measured during storage. Sensory attributes were monitored in samples spiked with various concentrations of 6 -methoxymellein (6 -NM) to determine how this stress induced metabolite affects carrot quality. Phenolic polymerization due to autoxidation was associated with color loss in strained carrots. Declines in pH, soluble phenolics and total carotenoids all correlated with decreased chroma values. Significant losses in color, phenolics and carotenoids were found in the control and O 2 <b>sparged</b> samples compared to N 2 <b>sparged</b> and BFN 2 samples. Molecular weight of phenolic compounds was lower in nitrogen <b>sparged</b> samples than oxygen <b>sparged</b> samples. Sucrose values were slightly higher in BFN 2 and N 2 <b>sparged</b> samples while changes in glucose and fructose were not significant. Oxygen control strategies improved overall color of strained carrots. Genotypic evaluation indicated that pre-harvest stress induced formation of phytoalexins was detrimental to sensory quality. Addition of the phytoalexin 6 -@ to commercial strained carrots resulted in a just noticeable difference at 48. 4 - 71. 0 ppm, a 93. 7 ppm recognition threshold and a terminal threshold at > 180 ppm for bitterness.
