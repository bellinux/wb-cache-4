5|$|Public {{transport}} systems in Mumbai include the Mumbai <b>Suburban</b> Railway, Monorail, Metro, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses, black-and-yellow meter taxis, auto rickshaws and ferries. <b>Suburban</b> railway and BEST bus services together {{accounted for about}} 88% of the passenger traffic in 2008. Auto rickshaws are allowed to operate only in the <b>suburban</b> areas of Mumbai, while taxis are allowed to operate throughout Mumbai, but generally operate in South Mumbai. Taxis and rickshaws in Mumbai are {{required by law to}} run on compressed natural gas (CNG), and are a convenient, economical, and easily available means of transport.|$|E
5|$|The Mayor of London {{published}} a long-term {{vision for the}} London Overground in February 2012. It recommends that all London <b>suburban</b> rail services should eventually be devolved to TfL and that <b>suburban</b> services currently provided by Southeastern be devolved before 2020 to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. Southeastern's <b>suburban</b> services include the route between Victoria and Orpington via Herne Hill. TfL had {{announced that it would}} bid in late 2012 to have more involvement in these services after the expiration of Southeastern's franchise in early 2014, but the DfT announced in March 2013 that Southeastern's franchise was being extended until mid-2018.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} architecturally {{significant}} as a well-designed and well-preserved late 19th century <b>suburban</b> residence, with excellent interior detail and a matching carriagehouse. The {{area in which}} it is located was situated in an upper-class <b>suburban</b> area, but since the late 19th-century commercial and industrial buildings have entered the area. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the <b>suburban</b> lines tempted KES to extend their {{streetcar}} service west from Skøyen as a <b>suburban</b> line; the Lilleaker Line opened to Lilleaker in 1919, to Avløs in 1924 and to Kolsås in 1930. A new section from Jar to Sørbyhaugen opened in 1942, connecting the line from Jar to Kolsås to Nationaltheatret, and making it a rapid transit and the replacement of stock with wide <b>suburban</b> standard. This service remained part of the municipal Oslo Sporveier, that had bought all the streetcar companies in 1924.|$|E
5|$|After a {{tentative}} creation of several smaller <b>suburban</b> cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution {{in the creation}} of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits. Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of Père Lachaise, Montmartre, Montparnasse, and later Passy; these cemeteries became inner-city once again when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger ring of <b>suburban</b> fortifications in 1860. New <b>suburban</b> cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimetière parisien de Saint-Ouen, the Cimetière parisien de Pantin (also known as Cimetière parisien de Pantin-Bobigny), the Cimetière parisien d'Ivry, and the Cimetière parisien de Bagneux. Some of the most famous people in the world are buried in Parisian cemeteries.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} began to promote suburbanization by moving several federal agencies out of the capital {{in order to protect}} them against nuclear attack. As a result, <b>suburban</b> neighborhoods began to appear in Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt. In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading to <b>suburban</b> growth that would eventually cause the two distinct cities to merge into one large metropolitan area.|$|E

5|$|Between the 1940s and the 1970s, {{the city}} saw {{significant}} growth in <b>suburban</b> areas from population migration. Veterans were returning from military service {{in large numbers}} seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, {{a part of the}} local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture also contributed to the <b>suburban</b> boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the Interstate Highway System allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Electrification of the Melbourne <b>suburban</b> {{network was}} also carried out, {{with the first}} train running in 1919. By 1924 210,000 {{passengers}} passed through the main city terminal of Flinders Street station per weekday. St Kilda was Melbourne's busiest <b>suburban</b> station with 4½ million journeys, followed by Footscray with almost 4 million, then Elsternwick, Ascot Vale, Essendon and Balaclava. Technology advancements continued, with 3 position automatic signals introduced in 1915, the conversion of screw couplings to knuckle couplers from 1924, and the first remote controlled signalling provided in 1925. The first level crossing flashing lights were installed at Mentone on Moorabin Road in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Greater Mumbai, {{an area of}} , {{consisting}} of the Mumbai City and Mumbai <b>Suburban</b> districts, extends from Colaba in the south, to Mulund and Dahisar in the north, and Mankhurd in the east. Its population as per the 2011 census was 12,442,373.|$|E

5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} {{the opening of}} the three new stations 6,000 additional commuters used the northwest service. The Cumberland station became particularly attractive to <b>suburban</b> commuters from Des Plaines and Park Ridge; a study commissioned shortly after the station's opening found that only 12.4% of commuters parking in the Cumberland and Rosemont stations were Chicagoans. The influx of <b>suburban</b> commuters to the new Blue Line stops led to a fall in ridership on the Chicago & Northwestern's Northwest Line, which traditionally served the northwest suburbs near the new stops.|$|E
5|$|Motorists {{found the}} new road to be a {{convenient}} way of travelling across Toronto; this convenience helped influence the <b>suburban</b> {{shift in the}} city and continues to be a driving force of urban sprawl today.|$|E

5|$|On 11 June 1928 the <b>suburban</b> line Potsdam-Stadtbahn-Erkner {{was fully}} {{equipped}} with DC third rail gear. Five trains {{of the new}} DRG Class ET 165 – the type appropriately named Stadtbahn – went into service, still sharing the track with steam trains. By November 1928 all lines leading toward the Stadtbahn, namely the lines from Kaulsdorf, Spandau and Grünau {{as well as the}} Berlin Ringbahn, were fully electrified. Therefore, <b>suburban</b> services to Spandau could be moved from the long-distance tracks to the local tracks. The last steam trains disappeared in 1929 when the ring became fully operated by electric trains. Half-ring trains operated only as peak time services.|$|E

5|$|Paddington is the {{terminus}} for <b>suburban</b> {{trains to}} West London and the Thames Valley, also operated by Great Western Railway.|$|E
5|$|Paddington was {{extended}} again from 1930 to 1934. Platforms 2 to 11 were extended past the Bishop's Road bridge {{and a new}} parcel depot was built. <b>Suburban</b> services, which had never been considered important at Paddington, were increased as new housing estates in the Home Counties started being built. Bishop's Road station was rebuilt, giving an extra four platforms to Paddington (Nos.13–16) and providing a new ticket office and entrance for <b>suburban</b> services next to the bridge. A public address system was introduced in 1936. By this time, around 22,000 parcels a day were being forwarded from Paddington, with the Royal Mail service processing around 4,500 mailbags and 2,400 parcel bags every day.|$|E

5|$|Sheffield {{does not}} have as {{extensive}} a <b>suburban</b> and inter-urban railway network as other comparable British cities. However, there are several local rail routes running along the city's valleys and beyond, connecting it with other parts of South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and Derbyshire. These local routes include the Penistone Line, the Dearne Valley Line, the Hope Valley Line and the Hallam Line. As well as the main stations of Sheffield and Meadowhall, there are five <b>suburban</b> stations, at Chapeltown, Darnall, Woodhouse, and Dore and Totley.|$|E
5|$|<b>Suburban</b> localities in Royton include Haggate, Heyside, Holden Fold, Long Sight (or Longsight), Oozewood, Royley, Salmon Fields, Stott Field, Thornham, and Thorp. Thornham was {{formerly}} a township in itself, but was amalgamated into Royton in the late-19th century.|$|E
5|$|The 1990s saw costs further reduced on {{the rail}} network. Guards were removed from {{passenger}} trains in 1989, and driver only <b>suburban</b> trains commenced running in 1993, with the last <b>suburban</b> train crewed by a guard running in November 1995. In 1994 the National Rail Corporation was established, taking profitable steel, and intermodal trafficks from V/Line; and the Melbourne to Adelaide standard gauge line was opened in 1995 moving the break of gauge.|$|E
5|$|The Mumbai <b>Suburban</b> Railway, popularly {{referred}} to as Locals forms {{the backbone of the}} city's transport system. It is operated by the Central Railway and Western Railway zones of the Indian Railways. Mumbai's <b>suburban</b> rail systems carried a total of 6.3million passengers every day in 2007. Trains are overcrowded during peak hours, with nine-car trains of rated capacity 1,700 passengers, actually carrying around 4,500 passengers at peak hours. The Mumbai rail network is spread at an expanse of 319 route kilometres. 191 rakes (train-sets) of 9 car and 12 car composition are utilised to run a total of 2,226 train services in the city.|$|E
