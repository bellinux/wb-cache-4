50|$|<b>Standees</b> are {{typically}} displayed in theater lobbies or music stores {{in advance of}} film or music releases.In the movie business, the more bookings a theater makes in advance for a given film, {{the more likely it}} is to place <b>standees</b> in its lobby because of self-interest to spur consumer interest in its future screen offerings. <b>Standees</b> are also called lobby stands in the film industry. In recent years, theaters increasingly look to on-site advertising from non-movie companies as a revenue source, which creates occasional friction with film distributors. When <b>standees</b> for Paramount’s Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life incorporated a promotion for the 2003 movie’s tie-in promotion with Jeep automobiles, large theater circuit Regal Cinemas sought payments from Jeep for the exposure in its theaters. Paramount reportedly shifted bookings from 47 Regal theaters to other cinemas that erected the Tomb Raider/Jeep <b>standees</b> without payments from Jeep.|$|R

25|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I disrupted the young aviator's progress. On 1 July 1914, Berthold was recalled from his schooling to rejoin his infantry regiment; once there, he ruefully discovered his marching skills had deteriorated during his aviation sojourn. After a fortnight's refresher course in soldierly skills, he {{was returned to}} flying training. On 17 July 1914, he was officially transferred out of the 3rd Brandenbergers to aerial service.

500|$|Nocenti's {{position}} as editor on the X-Men books led to Uncanny X-Men writer Chris Claremont's discovery of Adams' work, {{and in turn}} to Adams' frequent association with that franchise during the 1980s, which began with New Mutants Special Edition #1 and Uncanny X-Men Annual #9, which {{were part of the}} [...] "Asgardian Wars" [...] storyline. Nocenti also asked Adams to produce a cover for Heroes for Hope, a 1985 book intended to benefit famine relief in Africa, which was written and illustrated by dozens of creators, including writers Harlan Ellison and Stephen King, and artists John Byrne, Charles Vess and Bernie Wrightson. Nocenti asked Adams to pattern the cover after Paul Smith's 1983 cover of Uncanny X-Men #173, whose focus was Wolverine charging the viewer. This in turn led to Bob Budiansky, {{who was in charge of}} producing Marvel's posters, asking Adams to produce a Wolverine poster with the same type of pose. The image, inked by Terry Austin, became not only a bestselling poster, but an iconic life-size <b>standee</b> for comics shops, and led to two other posters by Adams, a 1987 X-Men poster featuring most of the characters that had ever been a member of that team, and [...] "Mutants", a modification of Adams' 1988 Marvel Age Annual #4 cover that featured most of the characters appearing in all the X-Men-related books at the time, also with a charging Wolverine in the center. By 1986, Adams' professional career had been cemented, and he moved out of his parents' home and into an Oakland, California apartment that he shared with Mike Mignola and Steve Purcell. Adams and Nocenti reunited for a story in Web of Spider-Man Annual #2 (1986) in which Warlock of the New Mutants encounters Spider-Man.|$|E

[...] Kuhler styled the diesel locomotive DL-109 by ALCO, and the New Haven Railroad was {{allowed by the}} War Production Board to order 60 more. [...] Now limitation on railway design and Kuhler's German accent {{proved to be a}} disadvantage a sure sign being that he never got paid for his last streamstyling job of a steam locomotive for Southern Railway - in his own judgment his best design. [...] Finally Kuhler had to abandon free-lancing and to enter a position at American Car & Foundry (ACF) in 1944 where he developed double-deck sleepers, subway cars with <b>standee</b> windows and more.

2500|$|From 1936 to 1945, PCC {{cars were}} 'Air-Electrics' with {{friction}} brakes, doors, and windshield wipers operated by air pressure. [...] PRCo PCC 1600 of 1945 was the post WW2 All-Electric Demonstrator which eliminated the air compressor and associated piping while incorporating such features as <b>standee</b> windows, a sloped windshield to eliminate night time glare, redesigned back end, forced-air ventilation, and other features. [...] Dynamic brakes were the service brake on all PCCs; when almost stopped, friction brakes completed the stop {{and held the}} car in [...] "park". [...] Dynamic brakes slowed the [...] "Air" [...] cars to 3.0-mph at which point a lock-out relay allowed automatic application of air-applied friction brakes against {{each of the eight}} wheels. [...] On All-Electric cars the dynamics were effective to 0.75-mph where the lockout relay then allowed a spring applied friction brake to engage a drum on each of the four motor drive shafts; this completed the stop and held the car in park. [...] Drum brakes were released by an electric solenoid operating from low-voltage battery power; a power failure would prevent the drums from releasing which would prevent power application, a fail-safe feature. Drum brakes were quite popular and greatly reduced maintenance thus some [...] "Air" [...] cars were retrofitted with drums. [...] Four magnetic brakes, one between the wheels on each side of each truck, applied additional braking for emergency stopping where all brakes were generally employed.|$|E
