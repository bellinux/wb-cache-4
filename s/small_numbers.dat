5|$|Although {{recorded}} in <b>small</b> <b>numbers</b> sporadically throughout twentieth century {{it was not}} until the 1980s that Grey-headed flying foxes routinely visited Melbourne. Since the 1990s their permanent colony in Melbourne has been postulated as possibly due to habitat loss in their northern range, greater supply of reliable food by native eucalypt plantings and backyard fruit trees, climate change, and increase urbanisation leading to warmer temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Robbins medallions {{were also}} struck, in very <b>small</b> <b>numbers,</b> in 14k gold. These medallions were {{generally}} {{ordered by the}} mission crew as a personal memento of their flight and were often taken to the lunar surface in the Landing Module.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{majority}} of information is contained in the <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of linear combinations of the measured voltages. Therefore, a <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of synthetic beams, perhaps an order of magnitude <b>smaller</b> than the <b>number</b> of physical feeds, can be used for imaging and calibration. From the other side, only a <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of gains can be calibrated using the full-beam self-calibration approach. An algorithm to compute the beamformer weights for an optimal calibration has been described. ...|$|R

5|$|Electron-beam {{lithography}} (EBL) is {{a method}} of etching semiconductors at resolutions smaller than a micrometer. This technique is limited by high costs, slow performance, the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids. The last problem limits the resolution to about 10nm. For this reason, EBL is primarily used {{for the production of}} <b>small</b> <b>numbers</b> of specialized integrated circuits.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, the walrus {{was heavily}} {{exploited}} by American and European sealers and whalers, {{leading to the}} near extirpation of the Atlantic population.

5|$|Optimally, the speedup from parallelization {{would be}} linear—doubling {{the number of}} {{processing}} elements should halve the runtime, and doubling it a second time should again halve the runtime.
