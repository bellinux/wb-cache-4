Yeongjo reinstated the short-lived universal military service tax, then he even went beyond the palace gate and solicited the opinion of officials, literati (scholars), soldiers and peasants. Yeongjo reduced the military service tax by half and ordered the variance be supplemented by taxes on fisheries, <b>salt,</b> <b>vessels</b> and an additional land tax. Yeongjo also regularized the financial system of state revenues and expenses by adopting an accounting system. His realistic policies allowed payment of taxes on grain from the remote mountainous areas Gyeongsang do province, to the nearby port, with payment in cotton or cash for grain. The circulation of currency was encouraged by increasing coin casting.|$|R

The valuable {sup 238 }Pu is recycled using aqueous recovery techniques. Experimental test results for this technology indicate a plutonium recovery efficiency of 99 %. Molten salt oxidation stabilizes the waste converting it to a non-combustible waste. Thus installation and use of molten salt oxidation technology will substantially reduce the volume of {sup 238 }Pu contaminated waste. Cost-effectiveness evaluations of molten salt oxidation indicate a significant cost savings when compared to the present plans to package, or re-package, certify and transport these wastes to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant for permanent disposal.

2500|$|The {{sacrificial}} service {{took place}} in the courtyard of the Temple at Jerusalem. Strictly speaking, slaughtering could be performed by a layman, but in practice was performed by priests. [...] The blood had to be collected by a priest, and rows of priests with gold or silver cups in their hands stood in line from the Temple court to the altar, where the blood was sprinkled. These cups were rounded on the bottom, so that they could not be set down; for in that case the blood might coagulate. The priest who caught the blood as it dropped from the animal then handed the cup to the priest next to him, receiving from him an empty one, and the full cup was passed along the line until it reached the last priest, who sprinkled its contents on the altar. The lamb was then hung upon special hooks or sticks and skinned; but if the eve of the Passover fell on a Sabbath, the skin was removed down to the breast only. The abdomen was then cut open, and the fatty portions intended for the altar were taken out, placed in a <b>vessel,</b> <b>salted,</b> and offered by the priest on the altar, while the remaining entrails likewise were taken out and cleansed.|$|R
40|$|A high salt diet in {{some species}} results in {{elevated}} arterial {{blood pressure and}} alterations in vascular smooth muscle responses to agonists. Weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were given either a high salt diet containing 8 % or a low salt diet of 0. 4 % sodium chloride {{for a period of}} 4 weeks. At the end of the feeding period, tail systolic pressure was higher in the high salt than in low salt rats. The rats were then killed and the intestines removed. Vascular smooth muscle (VSM) responses were estimated from the changes in lumenal diameter of pressurised second order mesenteric resistance arteries. High salt diet resulted in enhanced VSM responses to noradrenaline. The vessels dilated in response both to acetylcholine and to sodium nitroprusside and the responses were similar in vessels from both high and low <b>salt</b> rats. However, <b>vessels</b> from high <b>salt</b> rats were resistant to the blocking of endothelium derived nitric oxide (EDNO) with l-NAME and the responses were instead abolished by blocking endothelium derived hyperpolarising factor (EDHF) with apamin and charybdotoxin. These results show that in Sprague-Dawley rats, a high salt diet enhances the vasoconstriction in response to noradrenaline. The vasodilatory responses to acetylcholine were not significantly changed. However, they appeared to be mediated mainly by EDHF rather than by EDNO as in the low salt animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} mediating abnormal renal autoregulation in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats {{have not}} been fully defined. In the present study, we assessed myogenic responsiveness of interlobular arteries (ILAs), afferent arterioles (AAs), and efferent arterioles in isolated perfused hydronephrotic Dahl rat kidneys. Dahl rats were divided into four groups according to strain (Dahl salt-resistant [DRI or DS rats) and dietary sodium manipulation (rats fed low or high salt diets). Systolic blood pressure was elevated only in DS rats fed the high salt diet (202 + 4 mm Hg, p< 0. 05). Myogenic responses were obtained by stepwise elevation of renal arterial pressure. Vessel diameters were determined by computer-assisted videomicros-copy. Preglomerular microvessels of DS and DR rats responded differently to changes in renal arterial pressure. AAs and ILAs manifested diminished myogenic responsiveness to increasing renal arterial pressure in DS rats compared with DR rats (p< 0. 05). Both AAs and ILAs in DS rats manifested a higher threshold pressure for eliciting myogenic responses {{and a decrease in}} maximal pressure-induced vasoconstriction. The sensitivity of the AA myogenic response to nifedipine was enhanced in DS rats compared with DR rats (p< 0. 05). For rats fed the high <b>salt</b> diet, preglomerular <b>vessels</b> exhibited reduced myogenic responsiveness in both strains. In contrast to preglomerular microvessels, efferent arterioles from all four groups of rats failed to exhibit pressure-induced vasoconstriction. Our data suggest that diminished myogenic responsiveness of AAs and ILAs in DS rats contributes to impaired renal autoregulation in this strain. (Circulation Research 1992; 71 : 471 - 480...|$|R
50|$|By the 1800s Lambeth in London {{has become}} a centre for the {{production}} of salt glaze stoneware, and most especially after the establishment of Doulton and Watts Pottery, which later became Royal Doulton. The company was founded in 1815 when John Doulton formed a partnership with the owner, Martha Jones and foreman, John Watts, of an existing pottery in Lambeth. Initially the factory specialised in utilitarian salt glazed stoneware, similar to that produced by the Fulham factories. During the 1830s and 1840s considerable amounts of salt-glazed sewer-pipes were produced by Doultons following Sir Edwin Chadwick's advocacy of improved sanitary conditions. Doultons were also one of the earliest manufacturers of electrical insulators, initially using salt glaze stoneware and for the electrical telegraph systems. Also, from about 1830 they started production of <b>salt</b> glaze stoneware <b>vessels,</b> which were valued for their acid resistance, for the emerging chemical industries. From the 1850s Doulton & Co.'s decorative stoneware, that was produced in association with the nearby Lambeth School of Art, enjoyed significant success at various international exhibitions, including at The Great Exhibition in 1851, Philadelphia Exhibition in 1876, and also at Chicago in 1893. Their salt glaze decorative products became known as 'Doulton Ware'. By 1890 their decorative stoneware were so successful that 350 designers and artists were employed at the Lambeth factory, including the famous George Tinworth. Doulton’s Lambeth factory closed in 1956, due largely to new clean air regulations that prohibited the production of salt glaze in the urban environment. Production, but not of salt glazing, was transferred to their factory in Burslem which had been established in 1877.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{episodes of}} drought, lack of {{sufficient}} nutrients, exposure to toxic minerals, and soil compaction {{are just a}} few examples of the environmental constraints that the roots are exposed to during plant growth. Understanding how roots respond to these stresses is crucial for improving crop production under such conditions. Yet, investigating roots is a very difficult task and, therefore, very {{little is known about the}} precise role that the roots play in contributing to plant adaptation to hostile environments. It is assumed that while the root depth and abundance would contribute to drought tolerance, profuse rooting would enhance nutrient capture, and where the membrane transporters would exclude salts from the root cells. However, a great deal is still unknown about how these mechanisms actually operate; for example which particular characteristics of roots and root hydraulics actually contributes to water uptake in a way that confers increased tolerance, how the stress signaling from the roots affects the physiological relations in the shoot and those between the shoot and the root, how water and nutrient absorption relate to one another when both are limiting, or how roots avoid the loading of <b>salt</b> in xylem <b>vessels.</b> In this paper, our intention is not an exhaustive review of roots, but to highlight a few research topics related to abiotic stresses - mostly drought stress, but also nutrient limitation (especially phosphorus) and salt stress - where roots and their hydraulics are at the center stage. First, we provide an update on root structure, root hydraulics, and modes of water and nutrient absorption, mainly focusing on how inter- and intra-specific variations in these aspects can modify the way roots respond to a range of abiotic stresses. We then review scattered reports across a range of crops showing the contribution of roots to stress tolerance, and then report our own assessment of the role of roots using near isogenic lines (NILs) ...|$|R
40|$|There are vast {{sources of}} {{renewable}} energy in Great Britain but {{only a small fraction}} is being used because of the inability of the existing energy infrastructure to deal with the intermittency of supply. An alternative to storing the excess renewable energy in physical devices (e. g. batteries, pumped hydro) is to use the excess energy to power processes that convert CO 2 to valuable products. As CCS technologies start to be adopted by energy producers and become more widespread, a large quantity of CO 2 will be captured and stored underground. Instead of treating this CO 2 as a waste gas, some of it {{can be used as a}} raw material to produce alternative fuels and valuable chemicals using excess renewable energy generated when the demands for energy are low. There are many different pathways from CO 2 + “excess” renewable energy to valuable products. The aim of this work is to develop a comprehensive MILP model for CO 2 value chains that will include all of the pathways from primary resources to end-products (e. g. fuels and chemicals) considering the different technologies for conversion, storage and transport of resources. In this conference, we will present the results of the modelling work that we conducted for syngas value chains, which are important subsets of the entire CO 2 value chain landscape. Different technologies for the production of syngas (including fossil fuel-based technologies for comparison) and its conversion to different products are considered. The former includes natural gas reforming, biomass gasification and catalytic reverse water gas shift reaction between captured CO 2 and H 2 produced by electrolysis using excess renewable electricity. The latter includes Fischer Tropsch and alcohol syntheses to produce C 2 -C 3 olefins, >C 1 hydrocarbons and >C 1 alcohols, as well as different energy conversion technologies that can utilise syngas to meet different demands for energy services. Different storage technologies (e. g. pressurised <b>vessels,</b> <b>salt</b> caverns) and transport infrastructures (e. g. road transport of biomass, syngas pipelines) are also considered in the model. The model determines how to make best use of primary resources by optimising the combinations of technologies to use, where to locate them, when to invest in them, how to transport and store resources and so on. The model accounts for operational issues at different time scales, e. g. hourly time scales to capture intermittency of renewables and dynamics of energy storage, seasons to capture availability of biomass. Spatial dependencies are also modelled by representing Great Britain into different zones based on the National Grid’s study zones...|$|R
40|$|The {{seafaring}} {{people of}} Madura, situated off the northeastern coast of Java, {{are one of}} the leading maritime groups in the Indonesian archipelago. They have {{played a major role in}} indigenous shipping, and since the second half of the nineteenth century their importance in this field has been second only to that of the Bugis and Makassarese. With their strong maritime orientation and outward economy, the coastal Madurese contrast strongly with the agricultural orientation of their near neighbours, the Javanese and the Balinese. The first part of this thesis presents the Madurese in historical context vis-his the Javanese and the maritime groups of Sulawesi. It then considers the various historical and cultural-ecological factors which predisposed the coastal Madurese toward seafaring as a livelihood, and which enabled them to eclipse their former rivals along the north coast of Java. The main seafaring centres of Madura during the twentieth century are identified, with these being in three distinct locations: the northwest coast, the southwest coast, and the eastern islands of Madura. Special attention is paid to the two major commodities carried by traditional Madurese <b>vessels,</b> <b>salt</b> and cattle, leading up to a more detailed consideration of the major transport commodity from the 1960 s until the present, timber. The second part of thesis focuses on the role of the Madurese in the Java Sea timber trade. A key aspect of this account is the struggle between timber importers and the state. The legal aspects of the movement of timber are explained, along with their economic significance for importers and vessel operators, and the changing degree of compliance with the law from the early 1970 s to the much stricter enforcement after the mid- 1990 s. From the late 1990 s until 2003 the focus becomes closer to reveal the inner workings of the timber trade, with special attention paid to the rise of 'wild' ports on the isolated north coast of Madura, as well as the difficulties faced by many Madurese vessel operators after the ethnic conflict in Central Kalimantan in 2001. The profitability and risks of the perahu operators and timber traders are explained, and career profiles of several prominent individuals are presented. The study ranges widely in its setting, including maritime villages around Madura, perahu ports in Java, and timber ports in Kalimantan. It concludes that the traditional approach to business of the Madurese is no longer appropriate, and that diversification and change of approach are now necessary. The maritime entrepreneurs of East Madura have in this respect been more successful than their counterparts in West Madura, and it is suggested that this difference is linked to historical differences between the two areas...|$|R
