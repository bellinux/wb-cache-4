Arc-produced <b>switch</b> <b>closure</b> follows initial <b>switch</b> <b>closure</b> in less than 50 msec. When birds were trained on ratio schedules, the probability of interresponse times (IRTs) shorter than 50 msec exceeded 0. 30. Interval-trained birds produced a much lower probability of short-IRTs. When the schedules were reversed, there was only weak evidence of a reversal in the probability of short IRTs. A temporal analysis of topographic features observed in the original photographs failed to reveal differences between ratio and interval pecking topography. It appeared that only the point of contact with the key differed between subjects trained on the two schedules. It was concluded that only the locus, but not the topography, of the food-reinforced key peck was modified by the schedule of reinforcement...|$|E
40|$|Ultrafast plasma closing {{switches}} rely on sub-nanosecond {{electrical breakdown}} of the insulating gas. Until recently, little information was available on gas breakdown occurring within this timescale, because of the difficulties in designing an experimental system for such a study. Recently published papers have reported {{on the results of}} studies carried out using two devices designed specifically for the investigation of fast (sub-nanosecond) electrical breakdown processes. The devices are essentially modified transmission line plasma closing switches, and in this paper we describe their structure and operation. Because electromagnetic wave behaviour plays a significant role in sub-nanosecond switching, especially reflections from impedance mismatches, the design of the devices is based on transmission line concepts, rather than those of lumped parameters. One of the switches has a conical transmission line topology and is designed for the study of fast <b>switch</b> <b>closure</b> at insulating gas pressures less than 0. 6 MPa. The second has a hybrid radial transmission line/conical transmission line topology and is designed for the study of fast <b>switch</b> <b>closure</b> at pressures up to 10 MPa.

Here we investigate the effect of the context of action initiation on duration estimation in the case of finger movement.

At its core, the design employs a low-voltage high-current switch-mode amplifier to divert current {{out of the}} mechanical contacts and {{into a pair of}} anti-parallel thyristors. Commutation between transformer taps may then be performed by the thyristors. The amplifier and thyristors are placed outside the normal load current path and only conduct during a tap change, producing efficiency savings and improving robustness when compared to previous hybrid OLTC implementations.

40|$|Ionospheric phase delays {{of radio}} signals from Global Positioning System (GPS) {{satellites}} {{have been used}} to compute ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC). An extended Chapman profle model is used to estimate the electron density profles and TEC. The Chapman profle {{that can be used to}} predict TEC over the mid-latitudes only applies during day time. To model night time TEC variability, a polynomial function is fitted to the night time peak electron density profles derived from the online International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) 2001. The observed and predicted TEC and its variability {{have been used to}} study ionospheric in°uence on Radio Astronomy in South Africa region. Di®erential phase delays of the radio signals from Radio Astronomy sources have been simulated using TEC. Using the simulated phase delays, the azimuth and declination o®sets of the radio sources have been estimated. Results indicate that, pointing errors of the order of miliarcseconds (mas) are likely if the ionospheric phase delays are not corrected for. These delays are not uniform and vary over a broad spectrum of timescales. This implies that fast frequency (referencing) <b>switching,</b> <b>closure</b> phases and fringe ¯tting schemes for ionospheric correction in astrometry are not the best option as they do not capture the real state of the ionosphere especially if the switching time is greater than the ionospheric TEC variability. However, advantage can be taken of the GPS satellite data available at intervals of a second from the GPS receiver network in South Africa to derive parameters which could be used to correct for the ionospheric delays. Furthermore GPS data can also be used to monitor the occurrence of scintillations, (which might corrupt radio signals) especially for the proposed, Square Kilometer Array (SKA) stations closer to the equatorial belt during magnetic storms and sub-storms.

It has been quantified using a duration discrimination task. Most models of human duration discrimination hypothesise an internal clock.

Two experiments are described which addressed this hypothesis by parametrically varying {{the duration of the}} stimuli that are being judged. Changes in internal clock speed predict chronostasis effects proportional to stimulus duration. No evidence for proportionality was found. Two further experiments assessed the appropriateness of the control conditions employed. Results indicated that the chronostasis effect is constant across a wide range of stimulus durations and does not reflect the pattern of visual stimulation experienced during a saccade, suggesting that arousal is not critical.

MethodsFour different occlusal tables were created: two of 120 ° represented by an artificial inferior first molar either {{embedded in a}} periodontal‐ligament‐simulator or not; one of 100 ° (simulating the occlusion of anterior teeth) and a plane surface (180 °) in static and variable positions. Three levels of force (10 N, 50 N and 150 N) were applied, 40 times each, by a universal testing machine (Autograph®, AG‐I) with a spherical bur (diameter= 2. 2 mm) on the sensor film. One‐way ANOVAs with Bonferroni corrections for post hoc tests were used for multiple comparisons.

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of a radio-frequency (RF) microelectromechanical {{system to a}} time-varying electrostatic force is optimized to enhance robustness to variations in material properties and geometry. The device functions as an electrical switch, where an applied voltage is used to close a circuit. The objective is to minimize {{the severity of the}} mechanical impact that occurs each time the switch closes because severe impacts have been found to significantly decrease the life of these switches. Previous works have demonstrated that a classical vibro-impact model, a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator subject to mechanical impact with a single rigid barrier, captures the relevant physics adequately. Certain model parameters are described as random variables to represent the significant unit-to-unit variability observed during fabrication and testing of a collection of nominally identical switches; these models for unit-to-unit variability are calibrated to available experimental data. Our objective is to design the shape and duration of the voltage waveform so that impact kinetic energy at <b>switch</b> <b>closure</b> is minimized for the collection of nominally identical switches, subject to design constraints. A voltage waveform designed using a deterministic model for the RF switch is found to perform poorly on the ensemble. An alternative waveform is generated using the proposed optimization procedure with a probabilistic model and is found to decrease the maximum impact velocity by a factor of 2 relative to the waveform designed deterministically. The methodology is also applied to evaluate a design change that reduces the impact velocity further and to predict the effect of fabrication process improvements. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2827981...|$|E

Laser target triggering has been investigated at the University of Missouri as a method to reduce the laser energy required to trigger a laser triggered gas switch. Laser targets were solid materials embedded into the cathode of a LTGS that acted as a source of plasma when struck by a triggering laser. The expanding plasma altered the electric field in the switch, resulting in <b>switch</b> <b>closure.</b> Aluminum, graphite and tungsten were chosen as laser target materials based on several criteria including the results of measuring the liberated charge as a function of laser energy in a vacuum.

The LTGS was triggered by directing a laser pulse from a Nd:YAG laser onto the laser target.

40|$|As MEMS {{technology}} develops it {{is becoming}} better understood that MEMS designers must account for the large uncertainties characteristic of the relevant manufacturing processes. Uncertainty quantification tasks the designer with evaluating many different possible outcomes from the manufacturing process which creates a demand for models that are accurate and comprehensive, yet fast to evaluate. This work presents a comprehensive reduced-order model of electrostatically actuated switches incorporating a range of effects that are typically included only in FE modeling codes. Specifically, the model accounts for variable electrode geometry, stretching of centerline or large displacement effects, fringing field, squeeze film and rarefied gas damping, and allows for elastic contact with the dielectric substrate. Individual compact models {{for each of these}} effects are taken from literature and included in the model for the system. The dielectric substrate is modeled as an elastic foundation. The resulting partial differential equation for the switch modeled as a beam is discritized via a Galerkin method into ordinary differential equations for modal amplitudes. The Galerkin method uses the linear un-damped mode shapes of the beam to approximate the solution. Both cantilever and fixed-fixed type switches are analyzed. Static equilibrium solutions {{as a function of the}} applied voltage are developed along with their stability. Static pull-in voltages, first time of <b>switch</b> <b>closure,</b> and voltage for lift-off are studied with the model. To capture the contact dynamics, the contact condition is evaluated with the substrate divided into a large number of elements and the contact force is projected on to the beam basis functions.

40|$|AbstractDespite the {{prevalent}} involvement of loops in function {{little is known}} about how the constraining of end groups influences their kinematics. Using a linear inverse-kinematics approach and assuming fixed bond lengths, bond angles, and peptide bond torsions, as well as ignoring molecular interactions to assess the effect of the end-constraint only, it is shown that the constraint creates a closed surface in torsion angle space. For pentapeptides, the constraint gives rise to inaccessible regions in a Ramachandran plot. This complex and tightly curved surface produces interesting effects that may play a functional role. For example, a small change in one torsion angle can radically change the behavior of the whole loop. The constraint also produces long-range correlations, and structures exist where the correlation coefficient is 1. 0 or − 1. 0 between rotations about bonds separated by > 30 Å. Another application allows some torsion angles to be targeted to specified values while others are constrained.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{methodology}} for simulation of track settlement in railway turnouts (switches and crossings, S&C) is presented. The methodology predicts the accumulated settlement {{for a given}} set of traffic loads using an iterative and cross-disciplinary procedure. The different modules of the procedure include (I) simulation of dynamic vehicle–track interaction in a turnout applying a validated software for multibody vehicle dynamics considering space-dependent track properties, (II) calculation of load distribution and sleeper–ballast contact pressure using a detailed finite element model of a turnout that includes all of the rails (stock rails, <b>switch</b> rails, <b>closure</b> rails, crossing nose, wing rails and check rails), rail pads, baseplates and sleepers on ballast, (III) prediction of track settlement for a given number of load cycles and (IV) calculation of accumulated track settlement at each sleeper and the resulting vertical track irregularity along the turnout which is used as input in the next step of the iteration. The iteration scheme is demonstrated by calculating track settlement at the crossing when the studied turnout is exposed to freight traffic in the facing move of the through route. Due {{to the design of}} the crossing panel and the character of the impact loads induced by the transfer of wheels between wing rail and crossing nose, the load transferred into the track bed is not uniform and the resulting spatially varying (differential) settlement leads to vertical irregularities in track geometry. In the first paper of this work, track settlement is predicted using a discrete empirical model that gives the local vertical settlement {{based on the number of}} load cycles and the prescribed distribution of sleeper–ballast contact pressure. Such a model does not account for the material behaviour in, or the interaction between, different regions of the track substructure. In the second paper, a computationally efficient method for predicting long-term settlement in generic configurations of track (various combinations of track superstructure and substructure and nonsymmetric loading conditions) using a constitutive model accounting for the multi-axial stressstrain condition in the track substructure is developed. A key ingredient of the method is that the selected constitutive model evaluates track settlement in the cycle domain. The constitutive model is adopted for both the ballast and the sub-ballast but with different parameter sets. The dimensions of the three-dimensional finite element model of the track substructure and the number of sleepers that need to be included to obtain accurate settlement at the crossing are investigated. To predict a reliable distribution of settlement under a given sleeper, it is concluded that the loading on at least two sleepers on either side of the sleeper must also be included in the model...|$|R

With only minor modification, the manual shutter button on the camera was replaced with a simple <b>switch</b> <b>closure</b> via an I/O interface controlled by a PC computer. When the operant behavior activated the I/O switch, the camera took {{a snapshot of the}} subject's behavior at that moment. To illustrate the use of the camera, a simple experiment was designed to examine stereotypy and variability in topography of operant behavior under continuous reinforcement and extinction in 6 rats using food pellets as reinforcement. When a rat operated an omnidirectional pole suspended from the ceiling, it also took a picture of the topography of its own behavior at that moment. In a single session after shaping of pole movement (if necessary), blocks of continuous reinforcement, in which each response was reinforced, alternated with blocks of extinction (no reinforcement), with each block ending when 20 responses had occurred. The software supplied with the camera automatically stored each image and named image files successively within a session. The software that controlled the experiment also stored quantitative data regarding the operant behavior such as consecutive order, temporal location within the session, and response duration. This paper describes how the two data types [...] image information and numerical performance characteristics-can be combined for visual analysis. The experiment illustrates in images how response topography changes during shaping of pole movement, how response topography quickly becomes highly stereotyped during continuous reinforcement, and how response variability increases during extinction. The method of storing digital response-initiated snapshots should be useful for a variety of experimental situations that are intended to examine behavior change and topography...|$|E
40|$|Ohmic nanoswitches {{have been}} {{recently}} regarded to complement transistors in applications where electrical current leakage {{is becoming a}} problem. Although the solid state metal oxide silicon field effect transistor (MOSFET) has fueled a global technology revolution, it is now reaching its performance limits because of device leakage. To avoid electric field-induced damage in MOSFETs, operating voltage and hence threshold voltage must be reduced as linewidth is reduced. However, below a limit, the current cannot be turned off. The ohmic switch approach solves this problem because an air gap that separates the electrical contacts provides excellent electrical isolation when the relay is open. Some applications require these relays to perform billions to trillions of cycles, yet typical devices that are exposed to ambient environment degrade electrically {{after just a few}} thousand cycles. A critical challenge here is that trace amounts of volatile hydrocarbons in air adsorb on the electrical contact surfaces for a large variety of coating materials, causing an insulating deposit to form that prevents signal transmission during <b>switch</b> <b>closure.</b> We address this challenge by exploring the interactions of hydrocarbon contaminants with contact materials and operating environment on device lifetime. Our materials of choice are Pt, a common contact material in switch applications due to its resistance to wear, and RuO 2, which is believed to be somewhat resistant to hydrocarbon adsorption. We test our devices in N 2 and O 2 background environments with controlled hydrocarbon contaminant concentrations. We illustrate that the insulating hydrocarbon deposit can be electrically broken down and its resistance lowered. We show how electrical contacts that have degraded electrically due to contamination can have their performance restored to the original level by actuating them in clean N 2 -O 2 environment. It is then shown how this process creates a highly conductive carbonaceous deposit that protects the contact from wear. It is also v demonstrated that RuO 2 does not exhibit contaminant-induced degradation even at very high hydrocarbon presence, as long as O 2 is also present. These results show that even though the contaminant is ubiquitous in the environment, {{there are many ways to}} reduce its effect on ohmic switches...|$|E
40|$|A circuit {{that changes}} an {{electrical}} load in a switching time shorter than 0. 3 microsecond has been devised. This circuit {{can be used}} in testing the regulation characteristics of power-supply circuits. especially switching power-converter circuits that are {{supposed to be able to}} provide acceptably high degrees of regulation in response to rapid load transients. The combination of this power-switching circuit and a known passive constant load could be an attractive alternative to a typical commercially available load-bank circuit that can be made to operate in nominal constant-voltage, constant-current, and constant-resistance modes. The switching provided by a typical commercial load-bank circuit in the constant-resistance mode is not fast enough for testing of regulation in response to load transients. Moreover, some test engineers do not trust the test results obtained when using commercial load-bank circuits because the dynamic responses of those circuits are, variously, partly unknown and/or excessively complex. In contrast, the combination of this circuit and a passive constant load offers both rapid switching and known (or at least better known) load dynamics. The power-switching circuit (see figure) includes a signal-input section, a wide-hysteresis Schmitt trigger that prevents false triggering in the event of switch-contact bounce, a dual-bipolar-transistor power stage that drives the gate of a metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), and the MOSFET, which is the output device that performs the switching of the load. The MOSFET in the specific version of the circuit shown in the figure is rated to stand off a potential of 100 V in the "off" state and to pass a current of 20 A in the "on" state. The switching time of this circuit (the characteristic time of rise or fall of the potential at the drain of the MOSFET) is. 300 ns. The circuit can accept any of three control inputs. which one depending on the test that one seeks to perform: a repetitive waveform from a signal generator, momentary closure of a push-button switch, or closure or opening of a manually operated on/off switch. In the case of a signal generator, one can adjust the frequency and duty cycle as needed to obtain the desired AC power-supply response, which one could display on an oscilloscope. Momentary <b>switch</b> <b>closure</b> could be useful for obtaining (and, if desired, displaying on an oscilloscope set to trigger on an event) the response of a power supply to a single load transient. The on/off switch can be used to switch between load states in which static-load regulation measurements are performed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA large {{variety of}} biotic and abiotic {{processes}} take place {{close to the}} sediment-water interface, causing and being affected byphysical, biological and chemical gradients below and above this transition zone. Adequate sampling of this environment isessential for a comprehensive understanding of the complex sea floor ecological systems. The multi-horizon bottom watersampler (BoWaSnapper) presented here was developed for instantaneous sampling of the transition zone above the seafloor andcan be deployed in all types of water bodies from coastal seas to full ocean depth (6000 m). The intention was to construct aninstrument that could {{bridge the gap between}} the sampling of the bottom water column by conventional CTD rosette andsediment sampling gear such as a multiple corer. The BoWaSnapper was designed to be operated on any research ship?s wire and allows time-efficient high-resolutionsampling of bottom water. The bottommost 2 m are sampled with six vertically adjustable bottles. Prior to closure, the bottlesare aligned with the bottom current by means of a vane and flushed by bottom water for several minutes. This ensures thatparticles dispersed upon the touch-down of the BoWaSnapper are flushed away. An electronic mechanism, activated by abottom <b>switch,</b> initiates bottle <b>closure</b> after a delay pre-selected by the user. As illustrated by several examples, the transparentbottles (6 L volume each) allow the determination of particle concentrations as well as the analysis of solutes such as nutrients,dissolved gases, and natural radiotracers. Although the sampler is universally suitable for seafloor environments, its specialdomain is characterised by steep geochemical gradients such as cold vents and submarine groundwater discharge.

40|$|Abstract—Two-stage constructions and banyan-type {{networks}} play {{important roles}} in designing high speed switch fab-rics. Switch fabrics designed from two-stage constructions and banyan-type networks cannot realize all the permutations and are known as conditionally nonblocking switches. A renowned property for conditionally nonblocking <b>switches</b> is the <b>closure</b> property, i. e., if all the switches in a two-stage construction can realize a subset of permutations that satisfy a certain property P, then the switch resulted from the two-stage construction can also realize a subset of permutations that satisfy the same property P. However, such a closure property is mostly stated for the sufficient part in the literature and the necessary part of the statement is in general either not true or unknown. Finding such a necessary and sufficient result is of fundamental importance to two-stage constructions as it can completely characterize the permutations that are realizable by two-stage constructions. In this paper, we prove a necessary and sufficient closure property for two-stage constructions. For this, we consider uniform mapping permutations and define uniform mapping switches as switches that can only realize the set of uniform mapping permutations. We show that a switch constructed by a two-stage construction is a uniform mapping switch {{if and only if}} all the switches at the first stage and the second stage are uniform mapping switches. Such a necessary and sufficient result provides a complete characterization of the permutations that can be realized by two-stage constructions. Since banyan-type networks are constructed recursively by using two-stage constructions with 2 × 2 switches, we obtain a complete characterization for any realizable permutation of any banyan-type network as a composition of its trace, a uniform mapping permutation and its guide.

40|$|Cobalt {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} well recognized for the potential application as ultradense memory storage units. However, a reliable synthesis method is still lacking with the capability of size tuning in a large range. We developed a seeded synthesis procedure with nucleation and growth separation by using cobalt calixarene complex as nucleation agent to produce Co NPs from 10 nm to 30 nm with narrow size distributions. First, the influence of calixarenes as multivalent ligands on cobalt calixarene complexes’ thermal decomposition behaviors was studied by comparison with that of their monovalent counterparts. Upon thermal activation, cobalt calixarene complexes decompose quickly to form capped clusters, which coalesce into small cobalt nanoclusters without further growth if no additional growth reagent. The special property of the cobalt calixarene complexes inspired us to design a synthesis procedure that can separate the nucleation and growth based on the formation of capped clusters from cobalt calixarene complexes. We chose 1 –pentyne–Co 4 (CO) 10 (PTC) as growth reagent after testing three different cobalt compounds. A great correlation {{between the amount of}} PTC introduced and the final NP size, indicating it is a good growth reagent under the reaction conditions because of its low self– nucleation rate and high solubility. The system of cobalt calixarene complex and PTC produced uniform Co NPs in a large size range. A novel growth mechanism separating nucleation and growth in the synthesis procedure is proposed based on the thermochemical profiles of the nucleation and growth reagents. We indentified an amorphous intermediate from incomplete decomposition of PTC may {{play an important role in}} separating the nucleation and growth procedures. Finally, data on visualization of magnetism of self–assembled cobalt nanoring structures was reported, and a theoretical model was provided to explain the <b>switching</b> of flux <b>closure</b> states supported on the cobalt nanorings by off–axis magnetic pluses. ...|$|R
