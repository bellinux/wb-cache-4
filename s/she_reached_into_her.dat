60|$|After {{harvesting}} a {{good deal}} of very pleasant coaxing and petting and persuading, I forgave her and she was happy again, and by-and-by she got under way with her narrative once more. I presently discovered that the family treasury contained still another feature--a jewel of some sort, apparently--and that she was trying to get around speaking squarely about it, lest I get paralysed again. But I wanted to known about that thing, too, and urged her to tell me what it was. She was afraid. But I insisted, and said I would brace myself this time and be prepared, then the shock would not hurt me. She was full of misgivings, but the temptation to reveal that marvel to me and enjoy my astonishment and admiration was too strong for her, and she confessed that she had it on her person, and said that if I was sure I was prepared--and so on and so on--and with that <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> bosom and brought out a battered square of brass, watching my eye anxiously the while. I fell over against her in a quite well-acted faint, which delighted her heart and nearly frightened it out of her, too, at the same time. When I came to and got calm, she was eager to know what I thought of her jewel.|$|E

Willing to turn himself in {{as long as}} she goes along with him, Barnabas reveals his and Angelique's true natures in front of an angry mob and a fight ensues, pitting Barnabas and Elizabeth against Angelique. During the fight (following the mob's departure upon these revelations), Carolyn reveals to her family that she is a werewolf and joins her family in their battle against Angelique, but a fire later breaks out in the house. Ultimately, the ghost of David's mother (Josephine Butler) manages to hurl Angelique against the chandelier, which then falls to the ground, mortally wounding her as she starts to shatter. <b>She</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> chest and offers her heart to Barnabas this time as it shatters as well, resulting in her death.

50|$|House recalls that, {{during the}} bus ride, Amber sneezed, {{reached for a}} Kleenex, and complained {{that she had the}} flu. He then recalls what caused his concern; after she wiped her nose, <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> purse and pulled out {{prescription}} pills, {{which turned out to be}} amantadine. She took a heavy dose of two or three amantadine pills, right as the garbage truck plowed into the bus. The crash caused such extensive anatomical and physiological trauma (especially the blood loss and shock from her leg injury) that she ended up suffering from acute renal failure. This damage to her kidneys made them unable to adequately filter out the amantadine, causing her to overdose and thus causing all of her unexplained symptoms. Wilson suggests dialysis as a treatment, but House tells him during the memory of the moments leading up to the bus crash that unfiltered amantadine binds to proteins in the kidneys and therefore dialysis is unable to clear it from the blood. Ultimately, there is no treatment for Amber. House and Wilson begin to cry, and House goes into a seizure while still connected to the deep brain stimulation equipment. The seizure makes the equipment shift, causing House's brain to bleed, leading to him falling into a coma.|$|E
50|$|The group {{goes to the}} Burkittsville hospital, where Tristen's {{miscarriage}} is confirmed. As she {{is about}} to be discharged, Tristen sees a pale young girl walking away backward. Jeff takes the group back to his home, an abandoned broom factory against a steep hill in the woods. It has an elaborate security system, surveillance cameras, and a front door alarm. That evening, the group reviews Jeff's tapes and find hours of footage to be missing. Only one scene remains, which depicts a naked Erica holding onto a tree and swinging around it backward. Erica remembers no such event and runs off to pray, weeping as she does so. Each {{of the members of the}} group now begins to have hallucinations of horrible things (like eating a dead owl, murdering someone, or being locked in an asylum). Kim borrows Jeff's van to drive into town to pick up food and alcohol and has a heated argument with the convenience store cashier. The van she drives is attacked by locals as she leaves, and she crashes the vehicle into a telephone pole after swerving to avoid ghostly children walking along the road.

5000|$|The video {{made for}} the single was shot {{completely}} in black and white. Much like the track, the video clips were shot in an energetic, nearly-chaotic pace. The video starts off {{from the viewpoint of}} a young boy who witnesses his father's death. Tupac's lyrics of resistance to injustice and encouragement to bear arms and fight back are backed by his gathering groups of young black men and women to march in the streets. Between these are clips of the young boy in the aftermath of his father's death. After seeing his mother reminiscing on her lost husband, the young boy finds money in the house and takes to the street, later seen buying a gun from someone in an alley. Near the end of the video, Tupac, sporting a bulletproof vest, is walking around in a shooting range with a group of young people taking shots at paper targets (notably accurate in hitting [...] "rib cage" [...] and other vital locations on each target). In the final scene, Tupac and company have left, and the young boy is seen standing alone at the shooting range. He takes off his baseball cap and reveals himself to be a girl—the cap concealing <b>her</b> long hair. <b>She</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> coat to retrieve her gun and, now aiming at the target, fires a round.|$|R

Robinson and Ombeline arrive by train in Toulouse, the new capital city of France. There, he meets with his wife again who asks him to join her at her hotel, which is the new government headquarters. Robinson and his ex-wife make love but are interrupted by a call and new alarms. In the TV monitors, news is seen that the world is sinking into chaos. Robinson abandons Ombeline and decides to go to the theatre where Theo shall be singing; as the opera goes, Ombeline finds Robinson, she is furious because he had left her, but is forced to sit and watch the opera. She wonders about men and is tired of their infidelity. <b>She</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> purse and takes out Robinson's father's lamp-knife and cuts her throat. The opera is interrupted but, also, the sound of a bomb going off evacuates the theatre. Robinson wanders the streets and finds his wife who offers to take him in a military airplane to a safe place, because nuclear missiles shall be launched upon France, but he decides to stay to find Laetitia. She then decides to stay and, as she goes off to tell her party to leave, a terrorist attacks the van killing all; Robinson is injured by the debris. The next morning, all streets are deserted. Robinson stumbles back to the hotel and finds Theo there. They talk and Theo confesses that Robinson has been the love of his life. They kiss but Robinson suddenly stops. He opens the windows as Theo showers, but as he comes out of the bathroom, he jumps off the balcony and dies.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Buddha Project" [...] {{prompted}} Pritzker's {{interest in}} installation work. Concurrent with this interest in installation, Pritzker was drawn towards an art which interacted with nature, physically, aesthetically and philosophically. Her [...] "URBA.NATURAL", dating from 2010, consisted of four projects: [...] "zippers;" [...] "trunks;" [...] "birds.dogs.deer;" [...] and [...] "antlers.jaws.skin." [...] In [...] "zippers," [...] Pritzker uses {{the motif of}} the zipper as a reveal into nature and humanity's place within it. In [...] "trunks," [...] Pritzker incongruously united two of her long expressed themes, nature and human experience, by placing men's underwear or trouser torsos on trunks of trees. [...] "birds.dogs.deer" [...] brought together such diverse elements including porcelain, ceramic and resin figures of dogs, twigs, painted CDs and hand painted additions to photographs printed on aluminum. For [...] "antlers.jaws.skin," [...] <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> deep <b>into</b> <b>her</b> South American heritage and merged it with her connection to nature, drawing lines and shapes reflective of indigenous peoples on animal bones.|$|R
40|$|Shortly after a New York jury acquitted Bernhard Goetz {{of charges}} that he had {{attempted}} murder by rising angrily from his subway bench and shooting down four youths who were, in the polite euphemism of the street, hassling him for money, a syndicated cartoonist was inspired to draw what {{was intended to be}} the post-Goetz subway car. The imagery was at once stark and homely: two elderly women seated side-by-side in a car empty of other passengers, a screwdriver lying nearby, and outside, a crowd of people, eyes widened with fear, running away from the car. One of the women says to the other: 2 ̆ 2 Heavens!... I was just reaching for my lipstick. 2 ̆ 2 Such evocation in a simple cartoon! For the artist managed, with those seven words, to capture the shuddering tensions apparent in public reactions to the Goetz incident and the verdict in his trial, and much more besides. Mr. Goetz 2 ̆ 7 s public—those who declared him a hero from the first—can find in this cartoon a portrait of salvation of a sort. The people fleeing are thugs and toughs, the anonymous yet ubiquitous individuals who frequent New York 2 ̆ 7 s subway trains and cast terror with a glance. Now they must think twice about their victims. If those who are frightened can defend themselves with violence, then every honest and angry subway rider is a threat to those who have made the subway a violent place. Even intimidating a little old lady no longer promises gain without risk, for when <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> handbag, what comes out might as easily be a handgun as a change purse. Perhaps the odds are that she will turn over her paltry bankroll, as the hasslers hope, but the possibility that she will attack instead forces the criminals to reevaluate their plan. She might use force, even deadly force, to protect herself. Perhaps discretion is the better part of terror, and the young toughs who are thinking all of this through might do best not to be in the car when her hand emerges...|$|R

In one shot, {{she seems to}} be drawing and in another shot, she is lying on her bed, facing {{what seems to be a}} paper robot. Another shot shows Khan {{standing}} outside a building which is seen to be under construction. As Khan sings, various shots of herself staring into a shop window and a television can be seen. In the next shot before the chorus, Khan is walking down a dark street whilst holding a paper bag. She is dressed in a red coat. She sees a group of people gathered on the floor, examining what seems to be little coloured light bulbs. Khan then walks past an initially dark shop, and the lights turn on as she walks by. She takes a closer look into the shop window and sees various objects, such a spinning disco ball, a turntable and she is attracted by a heart-shaped red plastic object. She hears something and quickly turns behind, and the group of people she saw previously throws the light bulbs at <b>her.</b> <b>She</b> then <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> paper bag and takes out the same heart-shaped red plastic object she saw in the shop.
