40|$|Rationale and Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{conventional}} two-dimensional (2 D) digital subtraction angiography (DSA) with three-dimensional (3 D) rotational DSA in the investigation of intracranial aneurysm in terms of detection, size measurement, neck diameter, neck delineation, and relationship with <b>surrounding</b> <b>vessels.</b> A further aim was to compare radiation dose, contrast volume, and procedural time between the two protocols. Materials and Methods: Thirty-five patients who presented with subarachnoid bleeds on computed tomography and were suspected of having intracranial aneurysms underwent conventional 2 D DSA followed by 3 D DSA. The 3 D digital subtraction angiographic images were displayed as surface shaded display images. Aneurysm detection, sac size, neck diameter, neck delineation, and relationship of aneurysm to the <b>surrounding</b> <b>vessels</b> analyzed from the two protocols were compared. Radiation dose, contrast volume, and procedural time for both examinations were also compared. Results: Three-dimensional DSA detected 44 aneurysms in 31 patients, with negative findings seen in four patients. A false-negative detection rate of 6. 8 (three of 44) for 2 D DSA was noted. There was no significant difference in aneurysm size between 3 D and 2 D DSA. The sizes of aneurysm necks were found to be significantly larger in 3 D DSA than on 2 D DSA. The aneurysm neck and relationship to <b>surrounding</b> <b>vessels</b> were significantly better demonstrated on 3 D DSA than on 2 D DSA. Radiation dose (entrance surface dose), contrast use, and procedural time with 3 D DSA were significantly less than with 2 D DSA. Conclusions: Three-dimensional DSA improves the detection and delineation of intracranial aneurysms, with lower radiation dose, less contrast use, and shorter procedural time compared to 2 D DSA. The size of the aneurysm neck on 3 D DSA tended to be larger than on 2 D DSA...|$|R
40|$|Coronary arteries {{obstructed}} by atherosclerosis can {{be cleared}} by a balloon angioplasty {{accompanied by a}} permanent scaffolding implant ("stent"). There is, however, a 25 [...] 45 % occurrence rate of excessive thickening of the treated vessel wall a few weeks post-angioplasty, leading to a re-obstruction of the vessel ("restenosis"), and recurrent symptoms. Endovascular radiotherapy, a potential preventive treatment against restenosis, can be delivered by a stent impregnated with radionuclides. The present thesis examines the local dosimetry of radioactive stents.

40|$|Abstract—Image {{registration}} {{is a real}} challenge because physicians handle many images. Temporal {{registration is}} {{necessary in order to}} follow the various steps of a disease, whereas multimodal registration allows us to improve the identification of some lesions or to compare pieces of information gathered from different sources. This paper presents an algorithm for temporal and/or multimodal registration of retinal images based on point correspondence. As an example, the algorithm has been applied to the registration of fluorescein images (obtained after a fluorescein dye injection) with green images (green filter of a color image). The vascular tree is first detected in each type of images and bifurcation points are labeled with <b>surrounding</b> <b>vessel</b> orientations. An angle-based invariant is then computed in order to give a probability for two points to match. Then a Bayesian Hough transform is used to sort the transformations with their respective likelihoods. A precise affine estimate is finally computed for most likely transformations. The best transformation is chosen for registration. Index Terms — Hough transform, image registration, mathematical morphology, opthalmology, retina...|$|E

How electrotonic loading, refractoriness and capture of focal ectopics {{depend upon the}} intricate nature of physiological structural anatomy, as well as pathological tissue remodelling, however, is not well understood. In this study, we performed computational bidomain simulations with anatomically-detailed models representing the rabbit left ventricle.

We identified the cardioprotective effects of an aqueous extract of DJS using an ovariectomized (OVX) and ferric chloride- (FeCl-) induced carotid thrombosis rat model. Female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were ovariectomized or Sham-operated (Sham-control). The ovariectomized rats were divided into three groups: OVX with saline (OVX-control), aspirin 30 [*]mg/kg/day (OVX-ASA), and DJS 100 [*]mg/kg/day (OVX-DJS). The treatments were administered for 5 weeks. Then, blood samples were collected to analyze the serum lipid levels and platelet aggregation. The topical application of 40 % FeCl 3 induced intravascular thrombosis, which {{was used to test}} thrombotic occlusion and for histological examination. Body weight and the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) increased in the OVX rats. These effects were reduced by ASA and DJS treatment.

These treatments also increased time to occlusion and decreased both thrombus size and the presence of collagen fibers in <b>surrounding</b> <b>vessel</b> walls compared with the Sham-control and OVX-control groups.

40|$|The Swedish {{concept for}} {{geological}} disposal of radioactive waste {{involves the use}} of bentonite as part of an engineered barrier system. A primary function of the bentonite is its ability to swell when hydrated by its surroundings. One particular uncertainty is the impact on this function, resulting from deviations in pore-water pressure, pw, from expected in situ hydrostatic conditions. We present results from a series of laboratory experiments designed to investigate the form of the relationship between swelling pressure and pw, for compacted Mx 80 bentonite, from low to elevated applied water pressure conditions. The experiments were conducted using constant volume cells, designed to allow the total stresses acting on the <b>surrounding</b> <b>vessel</b> to be monitored (at five locations) during clay swelling. The results demonstrate that swelling pressure reduces nonlinearly with increasing pw, becoming less sensitive to changes at elevated pressures. After cyclic loading a marked hysteresis was also observed, with swelling pressure remaining elevated after a subsequent reduction in applied water pressure. Such behaviour may impact the mechanical and transport properties of the bentonite and its resulting performance. However, such hysteric behaviour was not always observed. Further testing is required to better understand the causes of this phenomenon and the controls on such behaviour...|$|E

The species grow in wet areas and {{are of interest}} because they represent the largest arborescent species known in the Cyperaceae. Stem diameters up to 120 mm and stems up to 10 m long have been observed. Such long stems tend to be supported by nearby vegetation. Although fresh stems are tough and woody, they are brittle. Branching of the stems is sympodial, and numerous branches are produced by plants growing in exposed habitats. There is less branching in plants from shaded habitats. Basal shoots may also occur. Adventitious roots develop basally on most plants, but with G. sieberiana, some adventitious roots form near the shoot apex and grow in and around leaf bases.

30|$|The {{metallic}} {{coronary stent}} {{acting as a}} tubular flow heater in the MRI examination was also modeled theoretically, by considering that the stent receives the energy from the rf electromagnetic field and heats up the <b>surrounding</b> <b>vessel</b> and the blood flowing through it. The analytical model has successfully reproduced the exponential increase of the stent’s temperature during our rf heating experiments {{in the absence of}} blood flow through the stent. The model was then used to predict the increase of the temperature of the stainless-steel coronary stent embedded in a coronary artery in the presence of blood flow through it, mimicking an in vivo realistic MRI examination. In the normal situation of a fully open (unoccluded) stent, the increase of the stent’s temperature as well as the increase of the blood temperature exiting the stent were found minute, of less than 1 °C, so that the blood flow efficiently cools the stent. This is a consequence of the much larger heat capacity of the blood as compared to the heat capacity of the stent. However, should the problem of restenosis occur with time after the stent insertion, where the stent in the vessel becomes partially re-occluded and the flow reduces, there is a risk of hazardous heating. The temperature of the occluded stent may become dangerously high to enable protein coagulation and the formation of blood clots in the stent’s surroundings.|$|E
40|$|The High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) was {{scheduled}} in October 2000 to implement design upgrades {{that include the}} enlargement of the HB- 2 and HB- 4 beam tubes. Higher dose rates and higher radiation embrittlement rates were predicted for the two beam-tube nozzles and <b>surrounding</b> <b>vessel</b> areas. ORNL had performed calculations for the upgraded design to show that vessel integrity would be maintained at acceptable levels. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) was requested by the U. S.

PNNL concluded that the calculated probabilities of failure for the HFIR vessel during hydrostatic tests and for operational conditions as estimated by ORNL are an acceptable basis for selecting pressures and test intervals for hydrostatic tests and for justifying continued operation of the vessel. While there were some uncertainties in the embrittlement predictions, the ongoing efforts at ORNL to measure fluence levels at critical locations of the vessel wall and to test materials from surveillance capsules should be effective in dealing with embrittlement uncertainties. It was recommended that ORNL continue to update their fracture mechanics calculations to reflect methods and data from ongoing research for commercial nuclear power plants.

40|$|Controlled {{thermonuclear}} fusion {{is one of}} the possible candidates for long term energy sources which will be indispensable for our highly technological society. However, the physics and technology of controlled fusion are extremely complex and still require a great deal of research and development before fusion can be a practical energy source. For producing energy via controlled fusion a deuterium-tritium gas has to be heated to temperatures of a few 100 Million °c corres­ ponding to about 10 keV. For net energy gain, this hot plasma has to be confined at a certain density for a certain time One pro­ mising scheme to confine such a plasma is the use of i~tense mag­ netic fields. However, the plasma diffuses out of the confining magnetic surfaces and impinges on the <b>surrounding</b> <b>vessel</b> walls which isolate the plasma from the surrounding air. Because of this plasma wall interaction, particles from the plasma are lost to the walls by implantation and are partially reemitted into the plasma. In addition, wall atoms are released and can enter the plasma. These wall atoms or impurities can deteriorate the plasma performance due to enhanced energy losses through radiation and an increase of the required magnetic pressure or a dilution of the fuel in the plasma. Finally, the impact of the plasma and energy on the wall can modify and deteriorate the thermal and mechanical pro­ perties of the vessel walls...|$|E

40|$|Smooth {{muscle cell}} (SMC) {{invasion}} into plaques and subsequent proliferation {{is a major}} factor in the progression of atherosclerosis. During disease progression, SMCs experience major changes in their microenvironment, such as what integrin-binding sites are exposed, the portfolio of soluble factors available, and the elasticity and modulus of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>vessel</b> wall. We have developed a hydrogel biomaterial platform to examine the combined effect of these changes on SMC phenotype. We were particularly interested in how the chemical microenvironment affected the ability of SMCs to sense and respond to modulus. To our surprise, we observed that integrin binding and soluble factors are major drivers of several critical SMC behaviors, such as motility, proliferation, invasion, and differentiation marker expres- sion, and these factors modulated the effect of stiffness on proliferation and migration. Overall, modulus only modestly affected behaviors other than proliferation, relative to integrin binding and soluble factors. Surprisingly, patho- logical behaviors (proliferation, motility) are not inversely related to SMC marker expression, in direct conﬂict with previous studies on substrates coupled with single extracel- lular matrix (ECM) proteins. A high-throughput bead-based ELISA approach and inhibitor studies revealed that differ- entiation marker expression is mediated chieﬂy via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling, and we propose that integrin binding and FAK drive the transition from a migratory to a proliferative phenotype. We emphasize the importance of increasing the complexity of in vitro testing platforms to capture these subtleties in cell phenotypes and signaling, in order to better recapitulate important features of in vivo disease and elucidate potential context-dependent therapeutic targets...|$|E
40|$|Cerebral aneurysms are a {{vascular}} dilatation {{induced by}} a pathological {{change of the}} vessel wall and often require treatment to avoid rupture. Therefore, it is of main interest, to estimate the risk of rupture, to gain {{a deeper understanding of}} aneurysm genesis, and to plan an actual intervention, the surface morphology and the internal blood flow characteristics. Visual exploration is primarily used to understand such complex and variable type of data. Since the blood flow data is strongly influenced by the <b>surrounding</b> <b>vessel</b> morphology both have to be visually combined to efficiently support visual exploration. Since the flow is spatially embedded in the surrounding aneurysm surface, occlusion problems have to be tackled. Thereby, a meaningful visual reduction of the aneurysm surface that still provides morphological hints is necessary. We accomplish this by applying an adapted illustrative rendering style to the aneurysm surface. Our contribution lies in the combination and adaption of several rendering styles, which allow us to reduce the problem of occlusion and avoid most of the disadvantages of the traditional semi-transparent surface rendering, like ambiguities in perception of spatial relationships. In interviews with domain experts, we derived visual requirements. Later, we conducted an initial survey with 40 participants (13 medical experts of them), which leads to further improvements of our approach.
