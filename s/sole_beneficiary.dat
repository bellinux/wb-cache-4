5|$|An inquest {{was held}} on 22 December; the jury could not {{determine}} whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and {{the outline of a}} new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by van Dieren, the <b>sole</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.|$|E

5|$|Izzie {{appears in}} the first episode of Grey's Anatomy, meeting fellow interns Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, Alex Karev, and George O'Malley. She and George move in with Meredith and become best friends. Izzie's boyfriend, hockey player Hank (Jonathan Scarfe), struggles to accept her new role as a surgeon, and the two break up. Izzie is hurt when Alex exposes her past as a {{lingerie}} model. However, the two later go on to begin a friendship and then a romance. Alex experiences sexual dysfunction with Izzie and cheats on her with nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback). When Izzie finds out, she breaks up with him, though they briefly reunite following a bomb incident at the hospital. Izzie reveals while treating a pregnant teenager {{that she had a}} daughter at the age of 16 and gave up for adoption. Izzie falls in love with cardiothoracic patient Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and the two become engaged. When Denny's condition deteriorates, Izzie deliberately worsens his health further by cutting his LVAD wire to move him up the donor register. Although Denny receives a new heart, he has a stroke hours later and dies. Izzie is the <b>sole</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of Denny's will, inheriting $8.7million.

25|$|On February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a {{press conference}} at the Park Theatres in Winter Park, Florida. The role of EPCOT was {{emphasized}} in the film that was played. After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the Reedy Creek Improvement District with two cities inside it, Bay Lake and Reedy Creek, now Lake Buena Vista. In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be property taxes and elevator inspections. The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967. The Supreme Court of Florida then ruled in 1968 that the district was allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds for public projects within the district, despite the <b>sole</b> <b>beneficiary</b> being Walt Disney Productions.|$|E

The Phantom questions Gustave about his talents and passions, finding that they are kindred spirits. Believing that Gustave {{will be able to}} see past the surface to what is inside, the Phantom is emboldened to remove the mask that hides his deformity ("The Beauty Underneath"). To his dismay, Gustave is horrified and screams at the sight, but Christine enters just in time to calm the boy. When the Phantom confronts her with his suspicions regarding Gustave's paternity, Christine confesses that the child is indeed his son, prompting the Phantom to vow that all his life's work will henceforth be for Gustave ("The Phantom Confronts Christine"). Unbeknownst to them, Madame Giry has overheard their conversation and is enraged, fearing that everything she and Meg have done for the Phantom over the years has been for nothing, as Gustave will be the <b>sole</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of his wealth and property.|$|E

40|$|This study assesses provincial taxi {{regulations}} on entry, fare, and trade in a Greater Vancouver regional context. Substandard taxi regulations explain why Vancouverites {{pay more for}} taxi service and wait longer {{to be picked up}} than in most other regions. The regulations impose additional costs on society, while doing little if anything to raise drivers’ incomes. The <b>sole</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> are the taxi license owners who earn super-normal profits because competition is tightly restricted. This study examines case studies to identify a regulatory regime that maximizes society’s welfare; this is a “pro-consumer” regime with free entry, deregulated fares, and no barriers to taxis picking up riders outside their home municipality. However, policy reforms need to be crafted to overcome acute industry opposition to liberalizing the taxi market with the associated loss of license values. Sequential reforms are proposed to open the market by dividing stakeholders and broadening public, consumer, and environmental support for change...|$|R
50|$|Some {{structural}} {{barriers to}} employment were removed {{by making it}} easier to combine income from work with income from social transfers. Capital incomes were taxed more heavily, while various measures were introduced which benefited lower social strata and improved their purchasing power. Employees were the <b>sole</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of lowered welfare contributions. Welfare benefits were raised, while income tax progression was increased, with tax cuts benefiting lower-income groups more strongly than higher-groups. Lower-income sections of the population received targeted support, and almost all tax measures introduced by the Jospin Government sought to stimulate demand and reduce inequality. Between 1997 and 2002, purchasing power as a proportion of household revenue from by 16%, the biggest five-year increase in over twenty years. In addition, total government spending rose 8.9% from 1997 to 2002. Altogether, the social and economic policies implemented by the Jospin Government helped to reduce social and economic inequalities, with income inequality in terms of the Gini coefficient falling between 1997 and 2001.|$|R

40|$|Random {{electromagnetic}} fields are ubiquitous in plasmas, {{the most common}} example being electromagnetic radiation of thermal origin. They should exert a random force on electrons and ions in a plasma, adding a random component to their motion. Products of randomly fluctuating quantities, such as velocity and magnetic field, which are correlated through the dynamical equations of the two-fluid model of plasma, should then exhibit non-zero average values. Investigation of such effects requires spatial-spectral representation of the non-linear equations of the two-fluid model. Chandrasekhar-Kendall (CK) functions, their generating function and its gradient defined over an infinite domain are shown to simultaneously provide orthogonal basis for solenoidal, scalar and irrotational fields respectively, facilitating transformation from coordinate space to mode number space and back. This paper constructs a theoretical framework for studying coherent effects of random forces due to random {{electromagnetic fields}} in a two-fluid plasma and discusses some results which follow from its structure. Azimuthally symmetric modes are shown to be the <b>sole</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of the cooperation of random modes in generating non-random effects. The formalism also facilitates investigation {{of the interaction between}} compressible dynamics, which plays a central role in plasma compression, heating and confinement and incompressible dynamics, which is involved in phenomena like turbulence and self-organization...|$|R

Providing public health services such as immunizations to the less affluent and advocating for state smoking bans, local {{health departments}} rely on government resources to fund their operations. Research indicates a positive impact of public health expenditures on the overall health of the population. However, individuals may not be the <b>sole</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of public health expenditures. A healthier population may lead to efficiency gains for surrounding health care providers. ☐ In this research, I use efficiency analysis to explore the relationship between public health expenditures and hospital efficiency. Specifically, I use the two-stage semi-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis proposed by Simar and Wilson (2007) to estimate how public health spending affects the technical efficiency of the surrounding hospitals. The results of this research suggest that hospitals are indeed positively affected by higher levels of public health spending that has occurred in their patient market two years prior. Specifically, hospitals operating in an area with a high level of per capita public health expenditures experience gains in efficiency of approximately 1. 66 percentage points relative to those hospitals operating in low public health spending areas.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the cost to}} U. S. cotton producers of two policy alternatives under which the U. S. seeks to cut its total AMS payments for cotton by 60 %. We considered two scenarios; the U. S. decides to act unilaterally versus conducting the policy initiative along with multilateral tariff and subsidy eliminations from the Rest of the World. The study found a 12 % cut in target price and 8 % cut in loan rate are necessary to reach the 60 % AMS targeted reduction under the unilateral scenario. In that regards, U. S. net farm income decreases considerably despite an appreciation of U. S. farm price. Under a multilateral trade liberalization from the Rest of the World, a 9 % cut in the loan rate and 4 % in loan rate are enough to reach the AMS reduction threshold. The study found there is 20 % chance that net farm income would appreciate and 80 % chance that it would decline. However, the decline is less severe compared to the situation where the U. S. acts alone. Overall, the <b>sole</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> in both policies are mainly the major exporters such as Brazil, Australia, West Africa, and Uzbekistan.
