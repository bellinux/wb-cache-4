5|$|Meanwhile, Peter, {{with help}} from his {{children}} Chris and Meg, decides to create his own animated series about a trio of handicapped ducks entitled Handi-Quacks. All of Meg's reasonable and sometimes rational <b>suggestions</b> <b>are</b> shot down by Peter and Chris in favor of their more unusual and nonsensical ideas. Peter eventually fires Meg. He and Chris then decide on a joke involving a wood stove and a house of cards, and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although {{it is suggested that}} the crudely animated and developed pilot episode will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to air the show, but Peter becomes angered when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of a tomato. Peter's passion about his work impresses Chernin into allowing him to air the episode unedited, but he decides not to let the episode be aired at all, which he later regrets.|$|E
5|$|The family becomes {{increasingly}} frightened and distrustful of him, especially when his latest advice leads Hayley {{to be attacked}} by a shark. With the shark loose in the house, the family fights for survival. Stan loses hope and admits Francine's <b>suggestions</b> <b>are</b> better than his own, until Klaus gives him an encouragement speech which inspires him to prove himself reliable in a crisis once more. Stan obtains a bear from the zoo to battle the shark, which only further aggravates the situation when the two animals work together to kill the family. Refusing to accept Francine's pleas to just get help, Stan instead throws a javelin that hits his wife in her shoulder instead of the bear. Buckle enters {{the house with a}} tranquilizer gun and sedates the two predators before also shooting Stan, who later tells Buckle that he made the right call. Despite the whole ordeal, Stan is no longer convinced that he should stay out of a future crisis.|$|E
5|$|The program {{requires}} that the reverse of the dollar depict a new design every year. In order to determine which design to depict on the coins, officials from the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, the Native American Caucus and the National Congress of American Indians, the consulting organizations for the program, appoint a liaison to the United States Mint. Between twelve and fifteen themes are selected after consultation with the National Museum of the American Indian and the Smithsonian Institution. At this point, the consulting organizations supply the Mint with written comments regarding the themes. The <b>suggestions</b> <b>are</b> then sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee, where a theme is recommended. After reviewing the recommendations and input from the contributing organizations, the selected theme is finalized, at which point designs are produced that represent the theme. Once designs are created, the consulting organizations and the National Museum of the Native American are consulted, and the designs are sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee for approval. Based on all comments and recommendations received, the Mint selects a final design that is recommended to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval.|$|E
40|$|When {{asking for}} donations, {{charitable}} organizations often suggest a potential amount to contribute. However, the evidence concerning {{the effects of}} such <b>suggestions</b> <b>is</b> scarce and inconsistent. Unlike the majority of earlier studies concerned with small-money solicitations, we {{examine the effect of}} larger nonbinding suggestions in the context of middle-range donations which are relevant in practice. In a randomized field experiment conducted in conjunction with the Bavarian State Opera, opera visitors received solicitation letters asking to support a social youth project organized by the opera house. The three different treatments were: no suggestion and suggestions of € 100 and € 200, respectively. Both <b>suggestions</b> <b>were</b> larger than average and median donations in this context. We find that suggested contribution levels substantially influence the distribution of donations actually received. The mean amounts given increase significantly if a <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> made. The increase is stronger in the € 200 treatment. On the other hand, the participation rate decreases if a <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> made. Overall, the returns from the campaign increase non-significantly when a <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> made. The solicitation was repeated a year later, without any <b>suggestion.</b> There <b>is</b> weak evidence that suggestions have a long-term effect on individual contribution-level decisions. I...|$|R

25|$|The Human Use of Human Beings {{is a book}} by Norbert Wiener, the {{founding}} thinker of cybernetics theory and an influential advocate of automation; it {{was first published in}} 1950 and revised in 1954. The text argues for the benefits of automation to society; it analyzes the meaning of productive communication and discusses ways for humans and machines to cooperate, with the potential to amplify human power and release people from the repetitive drudgery of manual labor, in favor of more creative pursuits in knowledge work and the arts. The risk that such changes might harm society (through dehumanization or subordination of our species) is explored, and <b>suggestions</b> <b>are</b> offered on how to avoid such risk.|$|E
25|$|Assuming that {{a problem}} exists, many have offered {{suggestions}} for narrowing the gap and correcting the problems arising from it. In general, those <b>suggestions</b> <b>are</b> along three lines. The first is that the military must {{reach out to the}} civilian world. Given the essentially universal agreement that civilians must control the military, the duty falls upon the military to find ways to talk to civilians, not the other way around. The second is that civilians must articulate a clear vision of what they expect in terms of the military mission. And the final suggestion is that the most practical and effective means of bringing about dialogue and understanding is to be bilateral education, in which both military and civilian elites would jointly attend specialized schools. Such schooling would emphasize military-strategic thinking, American history and political philosophy, military ethics, and the proper relationship between civil and military authority.|$|E
25|$|Seeking {{refuge from}} the waswās means that the seeker after refuge himself seeks God's refuge from its evil, i.e. from the evil lest it should whisper some evil {{suggestion}} into his own heart. The second meaning is that the caller to truth seeks God's {{refuge from the}} evil {{of the one who}} whispers evil suggestions into the hearts of the people against himself. It is not in his own power to approach all the people in whose hearts evil <b>suggestions</b> <b>are</b> being whispered against himself individually and remove the misunderstandings of every person. It is also not right and proper for him that he should give up his mission of inviting others to God and should devote all his tune and energy to removing the misunderstanding created by the whisperer and to answering their accusations. It is also below his dignity that he should stoop to the level of his opponents. Therefore, God has instructed the caller to truth to seek only His refuge from the evil of the wicked people, and then to attend single-mindedly to his work of invitation and mission. For it is not for him to deal with them but for God, who is Sustainer of men, King of men, God of men.|$|E

500|$|The organist Timothy Bond {{disagrees with}} the piece's [...] "bad press" [...] and the [...] "dismissive" [...] {{comments}} made about it by Brett and others. According to Bond, this [...] "fresh and vital" [...] work is [...] "a finer, more accomplished piece than it sometimes sounds in performance." [...] He notes the difficulty of finding the best registration – no registration <b>suggestions</b> <b>are</b> given – and the best organ to perform the piece on, since it seems to require steady and considerable changes in volume without changes in the tone quality produced by the organ yet also demands neoclassical [...] "brightness and clarity", a combination of requirements {{that it is difficult}} for organs to meet. On the right organ, however, Bond says that the piece can sound [...] "particularly striking" [...] and [...] "harmonically bold and telling, if occasionally gauche", as it moves through passages that are [...] "serene", [...] "creepy", [...] "vigorous", [...] "nostalgic" [...] and finally [...] "serene", albeit with a [...] "rather pedestrian" [...] cadence.|$|E

40|$|The rise of {{the field}} of “experimental mathematics” poses an {{apparent}} challenge to traditional philosophical accounts of mathematics as an a priori, non-empirical endeavor. This paper surveys different attempts to characterize experimental mathematics. One <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> that experimental mathematics makes essential use of electronic computers. A second <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> that experimental mathematics involves support being gathered for an hypothesis which is inductive rather than deductive. Each of these options turns out to be inadequate, and instead a third <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> considered according to which experimental mathematics involves calculating instances of some general hypothesis.
