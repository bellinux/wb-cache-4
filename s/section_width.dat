40|$|In a weak-coupling {{effective}} field theory framework we study quarkonium dissociation induced by inelastic scattering with partons in the medium. This is the dominant dissociation process for temperatures such that the Debye mass {{is larger than the}} binding energy. We evaluate the dissociation cross section and the corresponding thermal decay width. At leading order we derive a convolution formula relating the two, which is consistent with the optical theorem and QCD at finite temperature. Bound state effects are systematically included. They add contributions to the cross <b>section</b> and <b>width</b> that are beyond a quasi-free approximation, whose validity is critically reviewed. For temperatures such that the Debye mass is smaller than the binding energy, the dominant dissociation mechanism is gluo-dissociation consisting in quarkonium dissociation induced by the absorbtion of a gluon from the medium.

40|$|Abstract: Tire {{deflection}} {{is a key}} parameter {{and many}} equations have been developed based on it to evaluate the tractive performance of bias-ply and radial-ply tires. As deflections for a given tire size, inflation pressure and vertical load are significantly different between bias-ply and radial-ply tires, {{this study was conducted}} to predict deflection () of radial-ply tire based on <b>section</b> <b>width</b> (b), overall unloaded diameter (d), inflation pressure (P) and vertical load (W). For this purpose, deflection of four radial-ply tires with different <b>section</b> <b>width</b> and/or overall unloaded diameter were measured at five levels of inflation pressure and five levels of vertical load. Results of deflection measurement for radial-ply tires No. 1, 2 and 3 were utilized to determine multiple variables regression model and results of deflection measurement for radial-ply tire No. 4 were used to verify selected model. The paired samples t-test results showed that the difference between the deflection values predicted by model and measured by test apparatus were not statistically significant and to predict deflection of radial-ply tire based on <b>section</b> <b>width,</b> overall unloaded diameter, inflation pressure and vertical 2 load the multiple variables regression model = 75. 67 + 0. 104 b- 0. 107 d- 0. 758 P + 3. 519 W with R = 0. 986 can be strongly recommended.

The individual influence of the following geometric parameters on the joint capacity, <b>section</b> <b>width</b> ratio β of brace to chord members, <b>section</b> <b>width</b> to wall thickness ratio 2 γ of chord member, and wall thickness ratio τ of brace to chord members is made clear. Increasing either β or τ will enhance the joint capacity and increasing 2 γ will lower joint capacity. A reduction equation is proposed to consider the load effect of chord and the axial forces of out-of-plane braces. The tension of out-of-plane braces always lowers the ultimate capacity of joint. The same tension and compression have the equal influence on the joint capacity...|$|E
