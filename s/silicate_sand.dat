With the construction industry being responsible for approximately 50 % of UK carbon emissions, an increased use of low energy materials could {{go a long way}} to achieving this target. With this in mind, it is also important that materials still have adequate properties to fit their purpose. For this study, four limestone aggregates were compared with a silicate aggregate in order to assess the impact of the aggregate type on the properties of air lime mortar (CL 90). The primary focus was to assess the differences in compressive strength, and investigate reasons behind the measured differences. Without exception, the mortars made with limestone aggregate have higher compressive strengths than those made with <b>silicate</b> <b>sand.</b> Phenolphthalein staining shows slight differences in carbonation levels at 28 days, which could help to explain the strength differences observed.

40|$|Permeable sediments and {{associated}} microbial communities play {{a fundamental role in}} nutrient recycling within coral reef ecosystems by ensuring {{high levels of}} primary production in oligotrophic environments. A previous study on organic matter degradation within biogenic carbonate and terrigenous <b>silicate</b> reef <b>sands</b> in the Red Sea suggested that observed sand-specific differences in microbial activity could be caused by variations in microbial biomass and diversity. Here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing bacterial abundance and community structure in both sand types, and by further exploring the structuring effects of time (season) and space (sediment depth, in/out-reef). Changes in bacterial community structure, as determined via automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), were primarily driven by sand mineralogy at specific seasons, sediment depths and reef locations. By coupling ARISA with 16 S-ITS rRNA sequencing, we detected significant community shifts already at the bacterial class level, with Proteobacteria (Gamma-, Delta-, Alpha-) and Actinobacteria being prominent members of the highly diverse communities. Overall, our findings suggest that reef sand-associated bacterial communities vary substantially with sand type. Especially in synergy with environmental variation over time and space, mineralogical differences seem to {{play a central role in}} maintaining high levels of bacterial community heterogeneity. The local co-occurrence of carbonate and <b>silicate</b> <b>sands</b> may thus significantly increase the availability of microbial niches within a single coral reef ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|Permeable {{carbonate}} sands form a major {{habitat type}} on coral reefs and play a major role in organic matter recycling.

Here, we used flow-through reactors and stirred reactors to quantify potential rates of denitrification and the dependence of denitrification on oxygen concentrations in permeable carbonate sands at three sites on Heron Island, Australia. Our results showed that potential rates of denitrification fell {{within the range of}} 2 – 28  µmol L − 1  sediment h − 1 and were very low compared to oxygen consumption rates, consistent with previous studies of <b>silicate</b> <b>sands.</b> Denitrification was observed to commence at porewater oxygen concentrations as high as 50  µM in stirred reactor experiments on the coarse sediment fraction (2 – 10  mm) and at oxygen concentrations of 10 – 20  µM in flow-through and stirred reactor experiments at a site with a median sediment grain size of 0. 9  mm. No denitrification was detected in sediments under oxic conditions from another site with finer sediment (median grain size: 0. 7  mm). We interpret these results as confirmation that denitrification may occur within anoxic microniches present within porous carbonate sand grains. The occurrence of such microniches has the potential to enhance denitrification rates within carbonate sediments; however further work is required to elucidate the extent and ecological significance of this effect...|$|R

The concentration and composition of the residual NAPL in soil were determined with extraction in dichloromethane (DCM) and GC-FID analysis. The experimental results revealed that: (i) the NAPL removal efficiency increases rapidly in early times reaching a plateau at late times, where NAPL is removed almost completely (97 to 99. 7 %); (ii) the soil heterogeneity decreases the rate of NAPL removal efficiency, especially at lower NAPL concentrations; (iii) the rate of NAPL removal efficiency decreases with its concentration increasing...|$|E

For flowering plants, traits adapted to the terrestrial environments have to change or adopt a new function to allow the plants to survive and prosper in the sea where water motion tends to rotate and move seeds. In this investigation, how seeds of the seagrass Thalassia hemprichii (Hydrocharitaceae), a common monocotyledon in the Indo-Pacific, adapt to the wavy environment was studied. Mature seeds were collected from Dongsha Atoll in South China Sea. The effects of light qualities on seed germination, the seed morphology, the unipolar distribution of starch granules in the endosperms and growth of root hair-like filamentous cells from basal surface of the seeds were all found to {{differ from those of}} terrestrial monocotyledons. Physiologically, germination of the seeds was stimulated by blue light rather than red light.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the usage of manganese dioxide ore as a bio-filter media to remove metabolites in aquaculture closed system, and to determine whether manganese toxicity would at the same time represent a risk to fish. Initial work investigated the physical properties of manganese dioxide and its chemical interaction with ammonia and nitrite in the absence of biological activity. Subsequently, two pilot-scale pressurised filters were installed in a commercial scale hatchery in order to compare the metabolite removal performance of manganese dioxide against <b>silicate</b> <b>sand</b> in the presence of biological activity commonly found in aquaculture conditions. The investigation suggests that Mn medium is more reliable in converting ammonia to nitrate without producing a residual output of nitrite. The superior performance ofMn media compared with sand appears to be mainly related to the physical structure of the manganese ore. Furthermore, the Mn medium {{did not appear to be}} soluble in the ambient conditions normally found in aquaculture-closed system. From the design point of view, due to the higher ammonia and nitrite removal rates, a shorter retention time and a lower volume of media are required in the case of manganese dioxide technology compared with sand media. As a result, it is much easier to size a biofilter with Mn media. Manganese systems have a comparable total costs to conventional sand media, but using the Mn technology provides a more reliable control of toxic nitrite, thereby reducing risks offish loss and hence with reduced expected prod...|$|E

It has been further shown that the metal-mould reaction is considerably reduced if moulds were fired at high temperatures (> 1273 K). This ensured elimination of moisture from the mould and also resulted in some beneficial changes in the mould chemistry.

40|$|Sediments are {{fundamental}} for {{the function of}} oligotrophic coral reef ecosystems because they are major places for organic matter recycling. The Tayrona National Natural Park (TNNP, Colombian Caribbean) is located between the population center Santa Marta (> 455 000 inhabitants) in the southwest and several river mouths in the east. Here, coral reef sediments experience pronounced changes in environmental conditions due to seasonal coastal upwelling, but knowledge of relevant spatiotemporal effects on organic matter supply to the sediments and recycling processes is not available. Therefore, sediment traps were deployed monthly over 14 months complemented by assessment of sedimentary properties (e. g., porosity, grain size, content of particulate organic matter and pigments) and sedimentary O 2 demand (SOD) at water-current-exposed and sheltered sites along distance gradients (12 – 20 km) to Santa Marta and the eastern river mouths (17 – 27 km). Findings revealed that seasonal upwelling delivered strong (75 – 79 % of annual supply) pulses of labile organic matter mainly composed of fresh phytoplankton detritus (C : N ratio 6 – 8) to the seafloor. Sedimentary chlorophyll a contents and SOD increased significantly with decreasing distance to the eastern rivers, but only during upwelling. This suggests sedimentary organic matter supply controlled by nutrient-enriched upwelling waters and riverine runoff {{rather than by the}} countercurrent-located city of Santa Marta.

The grain size distributions of the total samples of the sediments of the shelf and the continental slope off Spanish-Sahara are controlled mainly by biogenic components. The supply of terrigeneous material {{in this area is}} very low. At deeper parts of the continental slope and in the deep sea areas, the relative amounts of carbonate minerals in the sediments are considerably reduced. The prevailing sand contents of the upper slope changes into clay dominance. On the shelf of Mauritania - represented by profiles extending down to 200 m water depth - the grain size is also controlled mainly by biogenic carbonates. Nevertheless, the admixture of fossil silicate components is important, too. The southern parts of the area is investigated are located in a region influenced by sediments of the Senegal River, which especially control the contents of silt and clay. The <b>silicate</b> <b>sands,</b> predominately of quartz, are fossil and form a mixed sediment with younger deposits. The carbonate contents of the different grain size fractions are formed either by sedimentation of carbonate and silicate particles of the respective grain size or by autochtonous disintegration of coarser sediment particles, as shown by the occurence of Mg-rich calcite and especially aragonite in the clay sized fraction. In the northern parts of the area investigated, which have very minute terrigeneous supply, the latter mechanism is the dominant factor, controlling the carbonate contents of the fine grain sized fractions. In the vicinity of the mouth of the Senegal the carbonate contents are influenced by extremely high dilution with terrigencous silicates. Mg-rich calcite and aragonite are produced preferentially in shallow slope and shelf areas up to 500 m of water depth. The specific surfaces of the carbonate-free clay fractions indicate that the clay fractions of the shelfareas with little terrigenous supply consits of relatively coarser particles. Very fine particles are removed and transported towards the deep sea. Lateral differentiation of this kind was not observed in the area off Senegal. The high surface areas, characterizing the clay fractions of this region, are thought to be due to high montmorillonite contents as was found for deep seas sediments. The mineralogical composition of the clay fraction from the southern parts of the area is characterized by high kaolinite and montmorillonite contents, while in the northern illite is predominating. At least two types of montmorillionites are present: in areas influenced by the Senegal mostly one type was found, which could swell to 17; on the shelves and slopes of the other regions the montmorillonite-group is represented by a montmorillonite-mica-type mixed-layer mineral. A "glauconite", found in the sand fraction, which had very similar properties to those of the montmorillonite-mica mixed-layer, {{is believed to be the}} source of this mixed-layer-type mineral.

The density gradient centrifuge (DGC) has been used to separate a power plant fly ash sample into fractions of different density. Each of the fly ash fractions obtained by DGC, an aliquot of the unseparated fly ash and an aliquot of a magnetic component of the fly ash, were digested in strong acids following the procedures outlined in ASTM 3050. Preliminary experiments have also been carried out to study the effect of mix proportions and curing regimes on the strength and density on the developed material. The DGC separation test reveals that most of the fly ash sample (approx. 90 %) has a density above 1. 9 g/cm{sup 3 }. Indeed, nearly half of the sample has a density greater than 2. 4 g/cm{sup 3 }. Since only a very small amount of this fly ash has a reasonably low specific gravity, it appears unlikely at this time that enough low density material would be isolated to significantly enhance lightweight concrete production using fractionated material.

The steps taken in the beneficiation of quartz sand for the production of bath crucibles are comminution which entails crushing and milling classification washing liquid dispersion sizing and reduction of iron content by magnetic separation. The slip contains materials like plastic clay feldspar kaolin talc sodium <b>silicate</b> water quartz <b>sand</b> etc. These were all milled in the ball mill for slip production casting and fettling glazing and sintering to get final bath crucibles as the end products. Quartz sand is used in a variety of products essentially as raw material for the foundry casting and glass industries and also in chemicals water filtration and ceramics the heat resistance nature of quartz sand makes it an excellent refractory substance for these industrial processes. Slip can be prepared for production of bath crucibles without the inclusion of quartz sand however the addition of quartz sand is needed to improve the mechanical performance of the slip {{in the production of}} bath crucibles...|$|R
40|$|Moulding <b>sands</b> {{containing}} sodium <b>silicate</b> (water-glass) {{belong to}} the group of porous mixture with low resistance to increased humidity. Thanks to hydrophilic properties of hardened or even overheated binder, possible is application of effective methods of hydrous reclamation consisting in its secondary hydration. For the same reason (hydrophilia of the binder), moulds and foundry cores made of high-silica moulding <b>sands</b> with sodium <b>silicate</b> are susceptible to the action of components of atmospheric air, including the contained steam. This paper presents results of a research on the effect of (relative) humidity on mechanical and technological properties of microwave-hardened moulding mixtures. Specimens of the moulding sand containing 1. 5 wt% of sodium water-glass with module 2. 5 were subjected, in a laboratory climatic chamber, to long-term action of steam contained in the chamber atmosphere. Concentration of water in atmospheric air was stabilized for 28 days (672 h) according to the relative humidity parameter that was ca. 40 %, 60 % and 80 % at constant temperature 20 °C. In three cycles of the examinations, the specimens were taken out from the chamber every 7 days (168 h) and their mechanical and technological parameters were determined. It was found on the grounds of laboratory measurements that moulds and cores hardened with microwaves are susceptible to action of atmospheric air and presence of water (as steam) intensifies action of the air components on glassy film of sodium <b>silicate.</b> Microwave-hardened moulding <b>sands</b> containing sodium <b>silicate</b> may be stored on a long-term basis in strictly determined atmospheric conditions only, at reduced humidity. In spite of a negative effect of steam contained in the air, the examined moulding mixtures maintain a part of their mechanical and technological properties, so the moulds and foundry cores stored in specified, controlled conditions could be still used in manufacture...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{precision}} agriculture, rapid, non-destructive, cost-effective {{and convenient}} soil analysis techniques {{are needed for}} soil management, crop quality control using fertilizer, manure and compost, and variable-rate input for soil variability in a field. Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy is an effective measurement method for estimating multiple soil properties at once. Methods: The experimental site is a commercial paddy field in lbaraki Prefectural Government, Japan. The experiment was conducted on 5 fields (6. 4 ha) after harvesting for development of multiple local calibration models (MLCM). To develop MLCM, soil samples were collected a total of 100 soil samples from the corresponding scanning positions of Vis-NIR data using Tractor-mounted soil analysing system (SAS). Partial least-squares regression coupled with leave-one-out cross-validation method were used to establish the relationship between Vis-NIR underground soil reflectance spectra captured by SAS and MLCM were obtained through soil analysis. To develop MLCM, the Unscrambler V 9. 8 software was used. We show coefficient of determination (R 2) and residual prediction deviation (RPD). Results: We obtained MLCM based on Vis-NIR underground soil reflectance spectra collected using SAS. The investigated soil properties were moisture content, soil organic matter, pH, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, total carbon, ammonium nitrogen, hot water exchangeable nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total nitrogen, exchangeable potassium, exchangeable calcium, exchangeable magnesium, hot water soluble soil boron, soluble copper, exchangeable manganese, soluble zinc, available phosphate, C/N ratio, MgO/K 20 ratio, CaO/MgO ratio, lime saturation degree, base saturation degree, phosphate absorption coefficient, exchange acidity, free iron oxide, sodium oxide, available <b>silicate,</b> bulk density, <b>sand,</b> silt and clay. The accuracy of MLCM on leave-one-out cross-validation method was obtained R 2 from 0. 70 to 0. 92 and RPD form 1. 81 to 3. 61. Discussion & conclusion: To get good local calibration model of Exchange acidity, sodium oxide and soluble zinc require addition of new sample data and reanalysis...|$|R
