Ninety six rats (140 to 255 g) were randomly grouped into four: A (Control), B (200 mg/kg), C (300 mg/kg) and D (400 mg/kg); and were treated for one, two and three weeks. Samples were collected after each of these periods. The results revealed significant increase (p< 0. 05) in the gonadosomatic index of the testis and the epididymis as well as significant increase (p< 0. 05) in the percentage of spermatozoa abnormalities in the test groups when compared with the control. These increase (p< 0. 05) were concentration-dependent for each week and increases (p< 0. 05) with duration of administration from the first week to the third week. It was therefore concluded that Aloe vera gel should be used with caution in breeding bulk, <b>stud,</b> <b>ram</b> and bull; and should be less than 200 mg/kg when being administered for up to 7 consecutive days...|$|E

Independente da epoca, as taxas de paricao e fertilidade das ovelhas foram elevadas, variando, respectivamente, de 85, 9 a 98, 6 % e 101, 0 a 105, 9 %. A fertilidade dos reprodutores exoticos foi considerada elevada, para estas condicoes, mas as ovelhas acasaladas com Suffolk requereram o maior numero de montas por concepcao e tiveram as menores taxas de paricao, comparadas as ovelhas servidas por carneiros de outras racas. A suplementacao alimentar dos animais em reproducao, associada a tosquia e ao sombreamento para os machos, garantiram a obtencao de elevadas taxas reprodutivas, ao longo de todo o ano. [Effect of Breed of Sire and Mating Season on the Reproductive Performance of Hairsheep Females Mated to Rams of Meat-Type Breeds]. Abstract: This {{study was}} conducted in a tropical semi-arid region and involved the establishment of three mating seasons to evaluate the reproductive performance of a hairsheep flock mated to rams from the following breeds: Hampshire Down, Ile-de-France, Suffolk, Texel and Santa Inês hairsheep. Irrespective of season of mating, lambing and fertility rates were high, ranging respectively from 85. 9 % to 98. 6 % and from 101. 0 % to 105. 9 %. Although fertility of rams had been taken as high, ewes mated to the Suffolk <b>stud</b> <b>ram</b> required more services per conception and showed the smallest lambing rate as compared to the ewes lambed from other breeds of ram. Feeding supplementation of breeding animals associated with shearing and shading for males guaranteed the reproductive performances all year round. 199...|$|E

40|$|Most {{agricultural}} products are produced on farms {{where there is}} a mix of activities, resulting in a range of co-products. This raises the issue of how best to model these complex production systems for Life Cycle Assessment, especially where there are benefits imparted by one activity in the mixed farming system to another. On the mixed farm studied, there were significant two-way reference flows (representing 288 t CO 2 -e/year or 10 % of the total farm emissions) between activities producing distinct products (wool, meat, grain) and these were modelled using system expansion. Cropping and sheep activities were modelled as separate sub-processes in the farming system, with unique inputs and outputs identified for each. Co-production from the sheep activity was modelling using allocation, comparing biophysical and economic relationships. Using an economic allocation resulted in different estimates of global warming impact for sheep co-products, with figures varying by 7 - 52 %. When compared to biophysical allocation, economic allocation shifted the environmental burden to the higher value co-products and away from the high resource use products. Using economic allocation, for every kilogram of wool produced there was an estimated 28. 7 kg of CO 2 -e emitted. Amongst the live animal products, the <b>stud</b> <b>rams</b> had the highest estimated carbon footprint (719 kg CO 2 -e/ram). Amongst the crops, estimates of emissions for the cereal grains averaged 202 kg CO 2 -e/tonne grain, canola 222 kg CO 2 -e/tonne and lupins 510 kg CO 2 -e/tonne, when modelled to include the benefits of the mixed farming system...|$|R

40|$|Merinos are the {{predominant}} sheep breed in Australia, accounting-for about 76 % {{of a total}} of 150 m. Approximately 197, 000 Merino rams are sold annually, of which 157, 000 are horned and 40, 000 are polled. The Australian Merino is above all a producer of premium quality white wool. The major determinant of wool income is weight, but the price per kilogram is influenced mainly by fibre diameter. Recording in Merino stud flocks is minimal. Sires are sometimes identified but dam identities are not routinely recorded. Neither are required for registration purposes. Subjective grading of breeding stock is still the main selection criterion, but there is an increasing emphasis on wool testing data. Several past attempts to design and establish recording services aimed at flocks with some pedigree information have been largely ignored by Merino breeders. However, successful testing services based on fibre diameter measurement and either greasy or clean fleece weights have been set up by some of the State Departments of Agriculture, the Australian Wool Testing Authority, the School of Wool and Pastoral Sciences (Univ. of N. S. W.) and by private consultants and are well supported.

40|$|The wool {{production}} and fleece analysis of 50 extremely plainbodied stud ewes are given. The ewes were {{typical of the}} sheep of the stud (including the <b>stud</b> <b>rams)</b> and were obtained from a breeder who had consistently bred for extreme plainness, so that this characteristic is successfully being transmitted to the progeny. Thirty-five four-toothed stud ewes, recorded in 1940, gave an average greasy fleece of 13 • 28 lb.; a clean scoured fleece of 7 • 47 lb. as bone dry, or 8 • 7 lb. at 16 per cent. Regain; a yield of 58 • 4 per cent as dry or 67 • 7 per cent. on the the Bradford system; an average staple length of 4 • 0 inches and a 60 's quality number with a coefficient of variability of 4 • 5 per cent., indicating a uniform group. The number of fibres per square inch of skin ranged from 31, 700 to 45, 000, {{with an average of}} 41, 600. The average fleece density was 2 • 51 per cent. Fifteen four-toothed stud ewes, recorded in 1941, gave an average greasy fleece weight of 12 • 17 lb. with 6 • 99 lb. of clean scoured wool as bone dry, or 8 • 1 lb. of clean wool at 16 per cent. Regain. The yield was 58 • 1 per cent. as dry or 67 • 3 per cent. on the Bradford system. The average staple length was 3 • 8 inches and the quality number a 60 's with a coefficient of variability of 4 • 3 per cent. showing a uniform group. The number of fibres growing per square inch of skin ranged from 30, 200 to 71, 600 with an average of 46, 700. The average fleece density was 2 • 54 per cent. It is concluded that the extremely plainbodied stud here described possesses a good stud standard of production in regard to the total wool, the length, and the fleece density. The view held by many sheepmen that extremely plainbodied sheep must necessarily have inferior fleeces, cannot be substantiated. Not only do these sheep produce profitable fleeces, but by virtue of their smooth skins and strong constitutions, they possess the practical advantages of the plain bodied type. The reliability of judging merino {{wool production}} in practice is discussed. It is contended that the judgment of fleece density and quantity of wool is difficult because of the grease factor and an increased need for fleece testing has been experienced. In the stud analysed there is a highly significant correlation between greasy fleece weights and scoured fleece weights and an insignificant correlation between greasy fleece weights and yield. In consequence, the breeder can, by selecting the highest greasy fleece weights, automatically improve upon the clean wool production. This recommendation does not hold where there is a definite relationship between greasy fleece weights and yields. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.
