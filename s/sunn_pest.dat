During feeding they also inject chemicals that greatly reduce the baking quality of flour made from damaged wheat. If 2-3% of the grain is damaged, entire lots may be ruined because the flour will be unpalatable and the bread will not rise. Heavy attack causes wheat stems to break before harvest.|$|E
50|$|The colour of the <b>sunn</b> <b>pest</b> varies but it {{is usually}} light brown. The body is a broad oval about 12 mm long.

These are laid in batches each having two neat rows of seven eggs, on the underside of leaves and on the stems of the host plant, or sometimes on weeds. The eggs take six to twenty eight days to hatch and the nymphs moult five times while they feed on the leaves, stems and ears of cereal crops for the next twenty to forty five days.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Sunn</b> <b>pest</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious pests of wheat and barley in Asia, North Africa and Eastern Europe. Using of {{resistant}} cultivars is an effective strategy for Integrated Pest Management (IPM). In order to identify the resistant wheat to <b>sunn</b> <b>pest,</b> 79 Iranian bread and durum wheat cultivars were evaluated for resistance to natural infestations of <b>sunn</b> <b>pest</b> in field conditions using CRD with four replications in Karaj in two cropping seasons. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences among the genotypes for overwintered density of the adult insect and spike damage. Based on density of overwintered adult insect, cultivar Darab 2 with an average of 12. 6 insects per m 2 had the highest density and was the most susceptible cultivar to pest damage and the cultivars Marvdasht, M- 82 - 6 and Bezostaya with densities of one insect/m 2 were the most resistant wheat genotypes. The density of overwintered adult insects in oat (resistant check) was zero. Based on the results for spike damage, line S- 83 - 13 with 80 damaged spikes per m 2 and the two cultivars MV 17 and Gaspard both with 10 damaged plants per m 2 were identified as the most susceptible and the most resistant wheat genotypes, respectively. Oat showed no damage based on this index. Based on the results of this study, it can be deduced that adult insects decrease grain yield through a reduction to number of grains per spike and number of spikes/area. It was also determined that at this growth stage of the <b>sunn</b> <b>pest,</b> those cultivars, which produce late heading and early maturing, incur less damage, indicating that the <b>sunn</b> <b>pest</b> prefers those cultivars that produce plants with more height than the shorter varieties...|$|E
