In this simulation study, we applied several control sampling approaches to control for confounding by various temporal patterns of an exposure variable and evaluated the usefulness of <b>symmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> control strategies. We simulated true relative risks (RRs; true ss = 0. 001) of deaths of 1. 051 per 50 -ppb increase of sulfur dioxide and included confounding by right- or left-skewed seasonal waves, linear long-term time trends, or a combination of both. The range of the estimated RRs from <b>symmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> control sampling approaches was 1. 044 approximately 1. 056 at either a long-term trend or any skewed seasonal wave of SO(2) levels, which indicated the bidirectional control sampling methods would successfully control confounding by design. The simulations with bidirectional sampling, however, show that biases may occur if waves are incomplete (20 - 43 % underestimated RRs). In conclusion, our simulations show that the <b>symmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> case-crossover design can substantially control for confounding by linear long-term trends and/or seasonality of an exposure variable by design as well.

Nevertheless, no one has reviewed its application and methodology in this context. Objective: We conducted a systematic review of case-crossover (CCO) designs used to study the relationship between air pollution and morbidity and mortality, from the standpoint of methodology and application. Data sources and extraction: A search was made of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Reports were classified as methodologic or applied. From the latter, the following information was extracted: author, study location, year, type of population (general or patients), dependent variable(s), independent variable(s), type of CCO design, and whether effect modification was analyzed for variables at the individual level. Data synthesis: The review covered 105 reports that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 24 addressed methodological aspects, and the remainder involved the design’s application.

Today, most backbone networks are still designed for bidirectional, symmetrical services like SDH/SONET.

Data sources Laboratory of Neurophysiology, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong. Data extraction Results of key research findings from 1992 to 1997. Results With constant velocity colckwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) off-vertical axis rotations as stimuli to the otolith organs, neurons in the vestibular nuclei and medullary reticular formation showed characteristic spatiotemporal behavious. One-dimensional neurons showed <b>symmetric</b> and stable <b>bidirectional</b> response sensitivities (δ) {{to change in}} velocity while two-dimensional neurons showed asymmetric and variable δ to velocity. This CW-CCW asymmetry to bidirectional rotations may provide directional coding in the modulation of neural signals. Vestibular nuclear neurons also displayed distinct spontaneous discharge patterns at the stationary and earth-horizontal position, indicating that one- and two-dimensional neurons belong to physiologically distinct etities. These spatiotemporal behavious of the vestibular nuclear neurons were also shown to be precisely controlled by imputs from the vestibulocerebellum and/or bilateral otoliths. In both the vestibular nucleus and the reticular formation, the best response orientations of one-dimensional neurons and the orientations of the maximum response vector of two-dimensional neurons were found to point in all directions close to the horizontal plane, indicating that all bead orientations on this plane are encoded across an ensemble of neurons.

We used Escherichia coli to study the properties of an artificial signalling system at the interface between two expanding cell populations.

40|$|In decerebrate cats {{that had}} been acutely hemilabyrinthectomized (HL), the {{extracellular}} activities of vestibular nuclear neurons on the lesioned and labyrinth-intact sides were studied during constant-velocity off-vertical axis rotations (OVAR) in the clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) directions (at 10 °tilt). Over the range of 1. 75 - 15 °/s, two types of neuronal responses were identified on both sides. Some neurons showed <b>symmetric</b> and velocity-stable <b>bidirectional</b> response sensitivity (δ defined as the CW gain over the CCW gain) while other neurons exhibited asymmetric and velocity-variable δ. The mathematically derived gain tuning ratios of these two groups of neurons were {{within the range of}} one-dimensional and two-dimensional neurons respectively. The best response orientations in one-dimensional neurons and the orientations of the maximum response vector, S(max), in two-dimensional neurons were found to point in all directions on the horizontal plane. On the labyrinth-intact side, both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional neurons showed asymmetry in the neuron numbers and/or the response gains between the two roll quadrants as well as between the two pitch quadrants. In addition, both the neuron number and gain were significantly higher for neurons in the head-down/ipsilateral-side-down half-circle than those in the head-up/contralateral-side-down half-circle. None of the aforementioned asymmetries was observed on the lesioned side. That a comparable pattern of distribution was observed in the one-dimensional and two-dimensional neurons suggests that these neurons maintain a common spatial. reference frame in encoding head orientational signals arising from the ipsilateral and contralateral otoliths. Furthermore, a predominance of two-dimensional neurons that exhibited a greater gain with CW rotations was observed on both sides of HL cats. Of the response dynamics observed amongst neurons on the two sides of HL cats, no difference was found with regard to the response gain and the pattern of response lead. However, a difference in response lag was observed between neurons on the two sides of HL cats. These suggest that there is a segregation of otolithic signals to reach the ipsilateral and contralateral vestibular nuclei. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that one-dimensional and two-dimensional neuronal responses could be elicited with inputs arising solely from the ipsilateral or contralateral otoliths. The observed orientational tuning and the CW-CCW asymmetry to bidirectional rotation may provide the essential directional coding of head orientations. Further, the imbalance of spatial/dynamic response patterns between the bilateral vestibular nuclei following the restriction of otolith inputs by HL implies that converging otolithic inputs from the bilateral labyrinths are essential for producing the neuronal responses in control animals. The results are also discussed in terms of the possible contribution of the various neural asymmetries between neuronal subpopulations in the bilateral vestibular nuclei to the behavioral symptoms accompanying acute HL. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A compact stacked {{bidirectional}} antenna is presented for dual-polarized 2. 4 GHz WLAN applications in this paper. The antenna {{consists of an}} orthogonal coupling feed driver and stacked director array, with the overall size 50 × 50 × 160 mm 3. Dual-polarization is excited by the orthogonal coupling lines, and the director array contributes to the bidirectional radiation. Both the coupling feed driver and directors are printed on FR 4 substrate and supported by plastic pillars. The measured bandwidth of the two ports are 2. 33 – 2. 62 GHz (11. 8 %) and 2. 32 – 2. 64 GHz (13 %) under the condition of VSWR less than 2. The isolation between two ports is lower than − 20 dB. The peak gains along one radiation direction are 9. 65 dBi and 9. 30 dBi for each port, with highly <b>symmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> beam pattern. The proposed antenna is compact and suitable for dual-polarized bidirectional 2. 4 GHz WLAN applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|Hop-by-hop {{interest}} shaping {{has been}} proposed as a viable congestion control mechanism in Named Data Networking (NDN). Interest shaping exploits the strict receiver-driven traffic pattern and the <b>symmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> forwarding in NDN to control the returning data rate. In this paper, we point out that both interests and contents contribute to con-gestion and their interdependencemust be considered in any interest shaping algorithm. We first analyze this issue mathe-matically by formulating it as an optimization problem to ob-tain the optimal shaping rate. Then a practical interest shap-ing algorithm is proposed to achieve high link utilization without congestive data loss. We further note that flow dif-ferentiation in NDN is complicated and design our scheme independently of traffic flows. We demonstrate our hop-by-hop interest shaper in conjunction with simple Additive-Increase-Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) clients using the ns 3 -based NDN simulator (ndnSIM). Our {{results show that the}} proposed shaping algorithm can effectively control con-gestion and achieve near-optimal throughput...|$|E
