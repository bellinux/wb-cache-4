50|$|Windows XP RTM {{introduced}} the Internet Connection Firewall. It was later upgraded to Windows Firewall in Windows XP Service Pack 2 with <b>support</b> <b>for</b> filtering <b>IPv6</b> traffic as well. By default, Windows Firewall performs stateful packet filtering of inbound solicited or unsolicited traffic on {{all types of}} network interfaces (LAN/WLAN, PPPoE, VPN, or dial-up connections). Like Internet Connection Sharing, the firewall has a location-aware policy, meaning it can be disabled in a corporate domain but enabled for a private home network. It has an option to disallow all exceptions which may be useful when connecting to a public network. The firewall {{can also be used}} as the edge firewall for ICS clients. When the firewall blocks a program, it displays a notification. Excepted traffic can be specified by TCP/UDP port, application filename and by scope (part of the network from which the excepted traffic originates). It supports port mapping and ICMP. Security log capabilities are included, which can record IP addresses and other data relating to connections originating from the home or office network or the Internet. It can record both dropped packets and successful connections. This can be used, for instance, to track every time a computer on the network connects to a website. Windows Firewall also supports configuration through Group Policy. Applications can use the Windows Firewall APIs to automatically add exceptions.|$|R
