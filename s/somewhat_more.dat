5|$|Although {{the human}} brain {{represents}} only 2% of the body weight, it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization. The brain mostly uses glucose for energy, and deprivation of glucose, as can happen in hypoglycemia, can result in loss of consciousness. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cortex consume <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> energy than inactive regions: this fact forms {{the basis for the}} functional brain imaging methods PET and fMRI. These functional imaging techniques provide a three-dimensional image of metabolic activity.|$|E
5|$|Australia's defence {{expenditure}} {{is much larger}} in dollar terms to that of most countries in Australia's region. The share of GDP Australia spends on defence is also larger than that in most developed economies and major South-East Asian countries. China spends <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> on defence {{as a proportion of}} GDP than Australia does, and has been rapidly increasing its expenditure. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has estimated that Australia's defence spending in 2015 was the 13th highest of any country in real terms. As a proportion of GDP Australia's defence spending ranks as 49th of the countries for which data is available.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year.

When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the Sun in early July, a total eclipse is <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E

5|$|Deep dives {{should be}} made only after a gradual {{training}} to test the individual diver's sensitivity to increasing depths, with careful supervision and logging of reactions. Diving organizations such as Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) emphasize that such sessions are {{for the purpose of}} gaining experience in recognizing the onset symptoms of narcosis for an individual , which are <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> repeatable than for the average group of divers. Scientific evidence does not show that a diver can train to overcome any measure of narcosis at a given depth or become tolerant of it.|$|E
5|$|For cover art, Bloomsbury chose painted art in {{a classic}} style of design, with the first cover a {{watercolour}} and pencil drawing by illustrator Thomas Taylor showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express, and a title in the font Cochin Bold. The first releases of the successive books in the series followed in the same style but <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> realistic, illustrating scenes from the books. These covers were created by first Cliff Wright and then Jason Cockroft.|$|E
5|$|Hu Zhengyan was a noted seal-carver, {{producing}} personal seals {{for numerous}} dignitaries.

Huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient, weathered impression, although unlike other Huizhou artists Hu {{did not make a}} regular practice of artificially aging his seals.|$|E

5|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that the Last Sonata, in B-flat major, is a farewell work in which Schubert faces his own death (somewhat analogous to the myths surrounding Mozart's Requiem); this is usually ascribed to the relaxed, meditative character which dominates the two opening movements. Death scenes are also associated, <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> explicitly, with the more tragic C minor Sonata; Charles Fisk, for example, mentions ghosts and a 'dance of death', in the outer movements. However, when judging from a biographical point of view, the notion that Schubert felt his imminent death {{at the time of}} composing the last sonatas is questionable.|$|E
5|$|Proximity of the {{peninsula}} to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter, resulting in significant temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds. Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons, while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones. Monsoon winds are common in most areas, with south and southwesterly winds prevailing in winter months and with <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> pronounced easterly winds in summer. Strong storm winds blow for 80‚Äì120days a year. The waters of the Murman Coast remain warm enough to remain ice-free even in winter.|$|E
5|$|Skin & Bone is a 1996 American drama film. It is {{the story}} of three Los Angeles-area hustlers, or male prostitutes, and their female pimp.

Ghislane, the pimp, sends each of the three young men into increasingly dangerous scenarios with clients, until both Billy and Harry are killed. The film stars B.
