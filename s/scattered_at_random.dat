40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} theory of time-harmonic wave propagation and reflection in a two-dimensional random acoustic waveguide with sound soft boundary and turning points. The boundary has small fluctuations {{on the scale}} of the wavelength, modeled as random. The waveguide supports multiple propagating modes. The number of these modes changes due to slow variations of the waveguide cross-section. The changes occur at turning points, where waves transition from propagating to evanescent or the other way around. We consider a regime where <b>scattering</b> <b>at</b> the <b>random</b> boundary has significant effect on the wave traveling from one turning point to another. This effect is described by the coupling of its components, the modes. We derive the mode coupling theory from first principles, and quantify the randomization of the wave and the transport and reflection of power in the waveguide.

Inside his homely hide beat the most affectionate, loyal, faithful heart of any dog since dogs were; and something looked out of his brown eyes that was nearer akin to a soul than any theologian would allow. Everybody at Ingleside was fond of him, even Susan, although his one unfortunate propensity of sneaking into the spare room and going to sleep on the bed tried her affection sorely.|$|E

We put up at the Queen's Hotel, a very large establishment, contiguous to the railway.

The climate is oceanic with high rainfall, 1400 mm, and high humidity. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging 5.6 C in January and 11.8 C in July. The prevailing winds, especially strong in winter, are southerly and southwesterly. Wind speeds average 13 km/h approximately 85 percent of the time and more than 24 km/h more than 30 percent of the time. Gale-force winds occur less than 2 percent of the time in any one year, but gusts of 185 km/h and more occur regularly on the high tops, and speeds of 209 km/h have occasionally been recorded near sea level. The tidal range is 2.9 m, and ocean swells of 5 m frequently occur, which can make landings difficult or impossible at any time of year. The oceanic location protects the islands from snow, which lies for only about a dozen days per year.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a detailed investigation of Digital Speckle Correlation (DSC) {{as a tool}} for the measurement of three-dimensional deformation fields and surface processes, i. e. changes in the microstructure of the surface. The method is based on a detailed analysis of the changes in the speckle field that is scattered from a laser-illuminated rough surface, using digital image processing. The extremely simple and robust optical setup is suited for uses in harsh environments outside the laboratory, e. g. in Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) applications. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, a new technique is presented to determine the complete deformation field, in particular the hitherto inaccessible out-of-plane component. The measurement relies on the analysis of the spectral properties of the decorrelation which is caused by local tilt. The accuracy of the measurement is about one tenth of the used wavelength, and thus comparable to interferometric techniques (e. g. ESPI). In the second part, different theoretical approaches to describe the <b>scattering</b> <b>at</b> <b>random</b> rough surfaces, including perturbation theory, Kirchhoff theory and the two-scale model, are advanced to determine the correlation of the scattered speckle fields in terms of parameters of the surface microstructure changes. The theoretical relations are verified by comparative measurements with high resolution scanning force microscopy (SFM) and by correlation measurements under a variation of experimental parameters. The results allow for the first time a quantitative whole-field monitoring of surface processes by remote optical means...|$|R

40|$|The {{diffusion}} process of acids plays {{important roles in}} chemically amplified resists. Polymer matrices form the diffusion path, and the structure significantly influences {{the behavior of the}} acid diffusion. We have simulated the diffusions of molecules in polymer matrices by molecular dynamics in order to analyze the diffusion mechanism in chemically amplified resist systems. To represent bulk state conditions of the polymer film, we prepared the molecular structures under the three-dimensional periodic boundary cOnditions utilizing the molecular simulation. This amorphous cell contained three chains of methacrylate polymers such as poly(methylmethacrylate), poly(tert-butylmethacrylate), poly(isobornylmethacrylate) and one diffusion molecule such as oxygen and methanesulfonic acid. The structure was energy-minimized and equilibrated under stable conditions. The free volumes in the system were estimated as the volumes enclosed by the iso-potential surfaces around the polymer using the Gusev-Suter method. The average size of the free volumes in the poly(methylmethacrylate) system was obtained as 3. 7 A 3 with large standard deviation of ' 1 1. 1 A 3, which indicates the large width of the size-distribution of free volumes <b>scattered</b> <b>at</b> <b>random</b> in the system. Molecular diffusion in the energy-minimized cell was simulated for 50 picoseconds by the molecular dynamics. The time dependence of the mean-square displacements of diffusing molecules was obtained from the dynamics treatments and it determined the diffusion constant in the resist systems.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to further our {{knowledge}} about the contribution of silent alleles on megabase chromosomes to the late stages of trypanosome infection and test the hypothesis that this contribution takes shape in a hierarchy of expression due to differences between alleles in terms both of flanking regions and coding sequence. This was achieved {{through a combination of}} bioinformatics and molecular studies. The initial approach was to undertake an extensive manual curation of the available VSG archive; this endeavour resulted in establishment of a fertile collaboration with the Trypanosoma brucei genome sequencing project, and in creation, with the aid of P. Ward and S. Menon, of a dedicated web-based tool to handle and query curated VSG genes. Out of an updated estimate of ~ 1600 VSG genes, 940 (between half and three quarters) were annotated and shown to be arranged in subtelomeric arrays and to be largely present as pseudogenes (~ 90 %). By considering separately the hypervariable N-terminal domain (three types, A, B and C) and the more conserved C-terminal domain (types 1 to 4, with two additional types identified in this study), it appeared that most of the degeneracy lay in the C-terminal domain. This suggested that N-terminal domains (one third of them being intact) would be utilised by a process of segmental gene conversion yielding hybrid genes, by recombination with functional C-terminal ends resident at the expression site. Under the assumption that “order” within the genome (the presence of patterns within the VSG archive) helps inform “order” in VSG expression (a hierarchy based on different activation probabilities), it was somewhat surprising to detect little evidence of clear substructuring within the archive: no “classes” of VSGs could be identified, based on coding sequence and flanking sequence features. In keeping with the observed high level of divergence within the VSG archive, clear orthologue groups (here defined as alleles sharing > 60 % amino acid sequence identity) were found not to include more than three to four members and to be <b>scattered</b> <b>at</b> <b>random</b> across the arrays.

40|$|Orofacial clefts are {{the most}} common craniofacial birth defects {{occurring}} in 1 / 700 births. Affected children need caring by a multidisciplinary team from birth until adulthood. Such a team includes many disciplines (nursing, plastic surgery, speech specialist, dentist, ….). Although quality of life can be improved with good care, the disease represents a burden to the patient, the family and society with important financial consequences. Orofacial clefts can be part of a syndrome, but most commonly, they occur as an isolated defect. Non-syndromic clefts have a complex etiology with genetic predisposition as well as environmental factors contributing to the condition. Many candidate genes have been identified based on human and animal studies. They play a role in different cellular processes required {{for the development of the}} lip and the palate (migration, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and adhesion). Environmental factors suggested to increase the risk of clefts are mainly maternal smoking and alcohol use. Supplementation of folic acid and multivitamins are suggested to be protective. One of the most common cleft syndromes is the van der Woude syndrome accounting for 2 % of clefts. It is mainly characterized by the presence of lip pits (85 %), cleft lip with or without palate (50 %) and hypodontia. In 2002, the Interferon Regulatory- 6 factor (IRF 6) was identified as the major causal gene of VWS, but also of the Pterygium Popliteal syndrome (PPS). In addition to the features of VWS, PPS patients can have popliteal and/or oral webs, unusual nails, syndactyly, ankyloblepharon and/or genital anomalies. In order to assess the prevalence of IRF 6 mutations in the European population, we collected a series of 51 patients with VWS and 17 with PPS. We showed that IRF 6 is causal in 66. 7 % of the VWS patients and in 76. 5 % of the PPS patients. Moreover, the mutations are not <b>scattered</b> <b>at</b> <b>random</b> with the majority of VWS mutations localized in exons 3, 4, 7 and 9, and the majority of PPS mutations in exon 4, suggesting that these exons should be screened first for clinical diagnosis. Genes responsible for syndromic clefts are strong candidates for non-syndromic cleft lip and palate as sometimes, phenotypes can be indistinguishable. IRF 6 is indeed a predisposing factor for isolated clefts. Based on the assumption that non-syndromic patients may have a mutation with a mild effect or polymorphisms acting as modifier, we screened 95 multiplex non-syndromic families for IRF 6 mutations. We found three mutations that were already described in VWS patients in three different families. A posteriori careful examination of the families allowed the clinical geneticist to reject the non-syndromic phenotype and change the diagnosis to VWS showing that a genetic result can lead to a more precise diagnosis. Moreover, we could identify a new minor sign that should be looked for when considering VWS. We also suggest that a priori non-syndromic families with autosomal dominant inheritance should be screened for IRF 6 (Publication I). Cleft can occur as a result of single nucleotide substitution but also as a result of cytogenetic abnormalities, the characterization of which can lead to the identification of causal genes. To find new candidate genes, we routinely performed 400 -band karyotyping. Subsequently, we used molecular karyotyping with Affymetrix SNP arrays to delimit borders of candidate regions or to identify copy number variations with a better resolution. One of the interesting genomic imbalances that we observed was a balanced translocation occurring in a familial case from Lille. In this family, father and child had a cleft of the palate, micro/retrognathia, malar hypoplasia and dental anomalies. The karyotype of both patients was 46,XY,t(1; 2) (p 34;q 33). Characterization of the breakpoints by FISH, chromosome microdissection and reverse array hybridization permitted to localize the relevant breakpoint on chromosome 1 in the first intron of FAF 1. Association studies displayed that FAF 1 predisposes to cleft palate and Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). In a screening of 228 individuals with isolated clefts, we identified two coding substitutions that might be responsible for the cleft as they are localized in domain important for the function of the gene. These changes were also seen in unaffected individuals. However, these changes could have a mild effect on protein function which without a certain genetic background and/or environmental triggers could not result in a cleft. Therefore, functional studies are required to test the effect of these changes. Knockdown of zFaf 1 in the zebrafish allowed us to observe orofacial anomalies due to defects occurring during chondrogenesis via Sox 9 expression alteration. We concluded that FAF 1 is a key player in jaw development and that disruptions of this gene are associated with orofacial abnormalities (Publication II). We also identified a t(1; 17) (p 21;q 24) translocation in a girl with a priori CP and dislocation of the hip. We mapped the breakpoint 600 kb upstream of SOX 9, a gene haploinsufficiency of which results in skeletal defects, PRS and genital anomalies referred to as campomelic dysplasia. In the light of the literature data and cytogenetic results, we suggested additional radiographic examination which reveals classical features of acampomelic campomelic dysplasia. In paralleI, we identified a deletion that co-segregated in a PRS family. This deletion was situated 1. 2 - 1. 4 Mb upstream of SOX 9 and overlapped one previously reported craniofacial enhancer. Sequencing of this regulatory element in a cohort of 73 PRS patients showed an enrichment of one SNP in the cohort compared to internal controls. By luciferase reporter assay, we showed that the minor allele weakened the enhancer activity of the regulatory element in which it was localized. Moreover, an association study with an intragenic SNP showed that SOX 9 variations play a role in cleft palate in two populations, and in PRS in our cohort (Publication III, submitted and IV, in preparation). Finally, we identified by microarray analysis a deletion of 22 q 13. 33 and a duplication of 12 q 24. 33 in a syndromic patient with cleft palate. Based on clinical and literature data, we hypothesized that the CP arose from the duplication of one or more gene in the 12 q 24. 33 region. In order to assess the role of candidate genes in the region, we conducted an association study using five variants in a set of 189 trios affected with CP or PRS. This is the first study conducted on a PRS cohort. Our results suggest two new associated factors for CP or PRS, SFSWAP and MMP 17, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated that SOX 9 and FAF 1 are implicated in CP in several populations and PRS in our cohort, giving human evidence for FAF 1 -SOX 9 pathway to play a role in palatogenesis and mandibular chondrogenesis. We also showed cleft type specificity for genetic factors such as IRF 6 and 8 q 24 locus do not associate with CP (Publication IV, in preparation). In conclusion, we show that clefts have a multigenic etiology with several genes, FAF 1, SOX 9, MMP 17 and SFSWAP associated with the condition. We show that syndromic patients and/or chromosomal alterations can lead to the identification of new candidate genes. Moreover, by two examples (IRF 6 with VWS and SOX 9 wit ACD), we demonstrated that a genetic result can help in differential diagnosis. (SBIM 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of wave propagation and reflection in an acoustic waveguide with random sound soft boundary and a turning point. The waveguide has slowly bending axis and variable cross section. The variation consists of a slow and monotone change of {{the width of the}} waveguide and small and rapid fluctuations of the boundary, on the scale of the wavelength. These fluctuations are modeled as random. The turning point is many wavelengths away from the source, which emits a pulse that propagates toward the turning point, where it is reflected. To focus attention on this reflection, we assume that the waveguide supports a single propagating mode from the source to the turning point, beyond which all the waves are evanescent. We consider a scaling regime where <b>scattering</b> <b>at</b> the <b>random</b> boundary has a significant effect on the reflected pulse. In this regime scattering from the random boundary away from the turning point is negligible, while scattering from the random boundary around the turning point results in a strong, deterministic pulse deformation. The reflected pulse shape {{is not the same as}} the emitted one. It is damped, due to <b>scattering</b> <b>at</b> the boundary, and is deformed by dispersion in the waveguide. The reflected pulse also carries a random phase. Comment: 30 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|In the primate, {{connections}} between {{primary visual cortex}} (V 1) and the second visual area (V 2) are segregated according to the characteristic pattern of cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity {{in each of these}} cortical areas. Patches supply thin stripes, whereas interpatches supply pale stripes and thick stripes. Previously, the projection from patches to thin stripes was reported to arise exclusively from layer 2 / 3. In this present report, we made injections of a retrograde tracer, cholera toxin-B (CTB-Au), into macaque V 2 thin stripes to re-examine the laminar origin of their input from V 1. While the great majority of cells indeed resided in layer 2 / 3, small populations were also present in layers 4 A, 4 B, and 5 / 6. The location of CTB-filled cells in each layer was analyzed to determine the relationship with CO patches. Cells in layers 2 / 3, 4 A, and 4 B were aggregated into patches, forming columns that project to thin stripes. Surprisingly, cells in layer 5 / 6 were <b>scattered,</b> seemingly <b>at</b> <b>random.</b> These findings confirm that the main V 1 projection to V 2 stripes emanates from patches in layer 2 / 3. However, multiple V 1 layers innervate V 2 thin stripes, and the projection from layer 5 / 6 does not respect the patch/interpatch dichotomy...|$|R
40|$|Microsatellite DNA {{sequences}} {{consist of}} relatively short repeats {{of one to}} five base pair units; together with satellites and minisatellites they comprise a larger family known as tandemly repetitive sequences. Microsatellites are found both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including humans, wherein they appear <b>scattered</b> almost <b>at</b> <b>random</b> throughout the genome. Although in prokaryotes distinct biological functions have been demonstrated, the role of microsatellites in eukaryotes is less clear. Nevertheless, several interesting hypotheses exist suggesting that certain microsatellites may exert subtle influences on the regulation of gene expression. Although {{the presence of these}} subtle mechanisms may be beneficial to a whole population, when they go wrong, as is thought to happen in the case of human trinucleotide repeat associated diseases, such as Huntington's disease, the consequences for the individual can be fatal. Most human microsatellites probably have no biological use at all; however, they are extremely useful in such fields as forensic DNA profiling and genetic linkage analysis, which can be used to search for genes involved {{in a wide range of}} disorders. With a primary focus on humans, it is the aim of this review to present an up to date discussion, both of the biological aspects and scientific uses of microsatellite sequences. In the latter case, basic theoretical and technical points will be considered, and as such it may be of use both to laboratory and non-laboratory based readers...|$|R
40|$|In Luristan {{in western}} Iran the nomad cemeteries are <b>scattered</b> {{apparently}} <b>at</b> <b>random</b> across the landscape. The history of these nomads {{is not very}} well known, and {{until a few years}} ago they were themselves largely illiterate. They have lived in areas which comprise some of the very isolated mountain valleys and plains in the central Zagros mountains, and untilrecently their rhythm of life was to a great extent determined by the changing seasons. In the interpretation of the images on Luristani tombstones, it may never be possible,with certainty, to arrive at the correct interpretation of a motif. The signs and symbols on the tombstones are comparable to a code whereby messages are converted from one form of representation to another, which means that they have to be encoded in a form that the communicants can easily interpret. In a community sharing the same religion, cultural inheritance and social background, and living at a given time in particular area, this should present no problem. But if one or more of these elements are altered, the whole structural pattern and symbolic scheme of the community will be affected: as, for example, is clearly demonstrated by the forcible settlement of nomads in Luristan which has caused an abrupt discontinuation in the erection of pictorial tombstones. The more drastic the change, the quicker the transition of symbolic values into fossilized and sometimes incomprehensible fragments of a tradition...|$|R
