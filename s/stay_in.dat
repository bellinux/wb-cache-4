40|$|Convention travel {{has been}} growing rapidly {{throughout}} the world {{in recent years and}} becoming a critical component of the hospitality and travel industry. Hosting of conventions, especially international conventions, can be used by host countries as part of a strategic marketing plan to publicize modern development, traditional culture, and tourism resources. It also stimulates economic growth in the hosting country. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the differences between the expenditures of delegates <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> hotels and delegates not <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> hotels in each category. It was expected that most of delegates <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> hotels were foreigners and most of delegates not <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> hotels were local people. A questionnaire was developed by using the categories of the 1993 IACVB Convention Income Survey as a base and executed in Taiwan. The subsequent data allowed the comparison between expenditures of the delegates <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> hotels and the delegates not <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> hotels. Overall, the average spending per delegate was US$ 621. 62 in this sample study. The delegate <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> a hotel spent an average of 6. 79 times the amount the delegate not <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> a hotel in this 4 day meeting. Recommendations for further studies were suggested. Additional research would help Taiwan determine the economic impact of the convention industry on the local economy in the future. Such research would also serve as a base for the convention industry positioning itself to receive future government support...|$|R
