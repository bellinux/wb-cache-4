50|$|President Polk reprised these {{arguments}} in his Third Annual Message to Congress on December 7, 1847. In it he <b>scrupulously</b> <b>detailed</b> his administration's {{position on the}} origins of the conflict, the measures the U.S. had taken to avoid hostilities, and the justification for declaring war. He also elaborated upon the many outstanding financial claims by American citizens against Mexico and argued that, in view of the country's insolvency, the cession of some large portion of its northern territories was the only indemnity realistically available as compensation. This helped to rally congressional Democrats to his side, ensuring passage of his war measures and bolstering support for the war in the U.S.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the winner}} of the 2006 Modernist Studies Association Book Prize, Michael North's Camera Works is widely {{recognized}} as an important contribution to the emergent field of [...] "new modernist studies." [...] Beginning with its seemingly unwieldy premise, that photography, film, and sound technologies of the early twentieth century exposed paradoxes in, while casting doubt on, the authority of representation, mediation, and even perception in both old and new media, that the new, original, and present, for example, could also be standardized, deferred, and endlessly reproduced, and that it was this [...] "complicatof the process of representation" [...] that inspired modernist experimentation and formal innovation as a means of repairing or renegotiating this break, Camera Works presents [...] "a general theory of the aesthetics of modernity," [...] one that [...] "takes very seriously the significant formal innovations provided by material history itself," [...] through its <b>scrupulously</b> <b>detailed</b> account.|$|E
40|$|Glutamate is {{the major}} {{excitatory}} neurotransmitter in the brain. 2 -Chloro- 4 -[2, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -(4 -trifluoromethoxyphenyl) - 1 H-imidazol- 4 -ylethynyl]pyridine (5) (CTEP) is the first reported negative allosteric modulator of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu 5 NAM) with a biological half-life of 48 hours in rodents and therefore considered an ideal tool for chronic studies in rats and mice.

50|$|Her {{intimacy}} with Jeanne Mance, Maisonneuve {{and the other}} prospective founders of Ville Marie, during the first winter spent near Quebec (1641-42), prompted her to follow them to Montreal, where {{she was the first}} communicant at the first Mass celebrated by Father Vimont, S.J. (1642). Except for an 18-month absence to help found the utopian colony of Ville-Marie Montr√©al in 1642, she lived cloistered with the nuns she supported. In spite of her entreaties she was never formally admitted to the novitiate, but led the humble and austere life of a true religious, <b>scrupulously</b> following every <b>detail</b> of the observances, and reaching a high degree of contemplative prayer.|$|R
5000|$|This quiet, {{unobtrusive}} German immigrant {{made many}} mountain-climbing pilgrimages for his meticulous drawings of San Juan and adjacent counties, which he subsequently transferred to maps that were as attractive {{as they were}} functional. Fischer drew his finished maps, even the text elements, entirely by hand before engraving and printing, distinguishing them from the typeset variety that came before and after. They are <b>scrupulously</b> correct in <b>detail</b> and were regarded as authoritative for many years. [...] The complex terrain of the San Juan area, characterized by precipitous peaks ranging from 11,000 to 14,000 feet, rugged passes, deep gorges, alpine valleys, and glacial basins, rendered accurate maps indispensable for miners and created a niche for this cartographer.|$|R
5000|$|In one chapter the {{children}} {{also come to}} the future, visiting a British utopia in which H.G. Wells is venerated as a prophet. Wells and E. Nesbit were both members of the Fabian political movement, as was George Bernard Shaw, and this chapter in The Story of the Amulet is essentially different {{from all the other}} trips in the narrative: whereas all the other adventures in this novel contain <b>scrupulously</b> <b>detailed</b> accounts of past civilisations, {{the children}}'s trip into the future represents Nesbit's vision of utopia. This episode can be compared to many other visions of utopian socialist futures published in that era; Nesbit's is notable in that it concentrates on how the life of children at school would be radically different, with economic changes only appearing briefly in the background. (It seems somewhat akin to William Morris's News from Nowhere.) It also mentions a pressing danger of Edwardian England: the number of children wounded, burned, and killed each year. (This concern was addressed in the Children Act 1908, and later in the Children's Charter.) ...|$|E
