50|$|The {{method of}} motion of a {{planetary}} gear structure {{is different from}} traditional parallel gears. Traditional gears rely on {{a small number of}} contact points between two gears to squeeze as the driving force, where all the loadings are concentrated on a few contacting surfaces, making the gears easy to wear and crack. But the planetary speed reducer has <b>six</b> <b>gear</b> contacting surfaces with a larger area that can distribute the loading evenly over 360 degrees. Multiple gear surfaces share the instantaneous impact loading evenly which make them more resistant to the impact from higher torque. The housing and bearing parts will not be damaged and crack due to high loading.|$|E

50|$|The tractor {{is built}} using a {{frameless}} block construction. The rear axle is a portal axle, the front axle is a swing axle. The wheelbase is 1668 mm. The {{track of the}} front wheels can be increased by turning the rims on the vertical axis. The internal expanding brake brakes the back wheels only. It can also act as a steering brake. The steering gear and the gearbox were produced by ZF Friedrichshafen. All Porsche-Diesel 218 tractors have a <b>six</b> <b>gear</b> gearbox with a crawler gear. The clutch is the single-disk dry clutch K 200 Z by Fichtel & Sachs. It operates with an oil hydraulic clutch by Voith. The exception is the Standard V 218, which has a five gear gearbox only. It also lacks the oil hydraulic clutch. Porsche-Diesel offered a Three-point linkage as an optional equipment. It can lift up to 550 kg The second optional equipment is a mowing bar. It was offered for DM 500. The weight of the tractor is 1625 kg including the three-point-linkage, the mower bar and the extra weights. The maximum weight allowed is 2300kg. The paint is RAL 3002 Karminrot for the body and RAL 1014 or 1015 Elfenbein for the rims. The Standard 218 doesn't have a fuel tap due to tightness problems.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} relationship between gear ratio and peak and mean power outputs (PPO and MPO) and peak cadence (PC) during a 10 -s all-out sprint on a multi-geared air-braked cycle ergometer. Ten physically active men [mean age 21. 0 years (SEM 0. 7) ] performed in random order six 10 -s sprints (15 -min rest between each sprint) on two occasions (48 h apart) in six different gear ratios; flywheel revolutions per pedal crank revolution (FR/PCR) ranged between 5. 22 and 11. 61. The PPO, MPO, and PC were recorded from each sprint. Of the <b>six</b> <b>gear</b> ratios tested, a gear ratio eliciting 8. 87 FR/PCR elicited the highest PPO for the initial test session; the PPO output of 1274 W was significantly greater (P < 0. 01) than that produced in the other five gears. Analysis of data from the second test session revealed no statistically significant difference in PPO between gear ratios eliciting 8. 00, 8. 87, and 10. 06 FR/PCR. The PPO from these three ratios were significantly greater (P < 0. 05) than those produced using the ratios resulting in 6. 32, 7. 06, and 10. 78 FR/PCR. The PC in the gear ratio maximising PPO was 120 rpm. Analysis of PC data revealed a significant decrease (P < 0. 05) as the number of FR/PCR increased. © Springer-Verlag 1996...|$|E
40|$|Power {{consumption}} {{is a very}} important issue for HPC community, both at the level of one application or at the level of whole workload. Load imbalance of a MPI application can be exploited to save CPU energy without penalizing the execution time. An application is load imbalanced when some nodes are assigned more computation than others. The nodes with less computation can be run at lower frequency since otherwise they {{have to wait for the}} nodes with more computation blocked in MPI calls. A technique that can be used to reduce the speed is Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS). Dynamic power dissipation is proportional to the product of the frequency and the square of the supply voltage, while static power is proportional to the supply voltage. Thus decreasing voltage and/or frequency results in power reduction. Furthermore, over-clocking can be applied in some CPUs to reduce overall execution time. This paper investigates the impact of using different gear sets, over-clocking, and application and platform propreties to reduce CPU power. A new algorithm applying DVFS and CPU over-clocking is proposed that reduces execution time while achieving power savings comparable to prior work. The results show that it is possible to save up to 60 % of CPU energy in applications with high load imbalance. Our results show that <b>six</b> <b>gear</b> sets achieve, on average, results close to the continuous frequency set that has been used as a baseline. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} one finishing electrode to finish multiple dies without remachining the electrode. The multiple-use electrode finishing experiment in this study addresses technology in the die-forging industry. Methods of manufacturing spherical straight bevel forge gear dies have relied on die-sinking Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) practices that showed great potential for advancement. The focus {{of this study is}} solely on the improvements of electrode use in EDM finishing-processes. The surface finish quality itself is not an area of concern other than maintaining that it does not diminish. The focused concern is maximizing the process by using one electrode unmodified for multiple-finishing operations. The objective for improvement is utilization of one finishing electrode used multiple times rather than only one finishing electrode per die. Utilizing a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), the inspection of specific locations on the finishing electrode reveals the repeatability and accuracy of use for one finishing electrode for <b>six</b> <b>gear</b> forging-dies. Initial experimentation validates the capabilities to finish four dies accurately in two separate die configurations with one electrode. To accomplish finishing the four initial dies, a die-sinking EDM machine that possesses a large enough working envelope was included in the process. The transition of using graphite electrode materials in place of brass for finishing multiple dies aids in reducing what was a total eight-hour process time into a four-hour process time. A machine with a working envelope large enough for only setting up one die to be EDM machined generated the eight-hour process time. The researcher achieved the eight-hour process time by replacing brass electrodes in the roughing stages with graphite electrodes. The extent to which one finish electrode can finish a sample set of six complete dies with one electrode is studied. Data is extrapolated from the deviation of absolute locations on a three-dimensional solid model compared to the multiple-use finishing electrode. Specific locations inspected on the electrode conclude the study efforts with results revealing that the maximum repeated use of an electrode is seven uses...|$|E

3000|$|About 100 common automobiles, classes A–E, {{currently}} on the road were considered. Ranges of gear ratios for the <b>six</b> <b>gears</b> were determined. For each of the <b>six</b> <b>gears,</b> its ratio range is divided into five levels. Taguchi experimental method is used, and an L 25 [...] orthogonal arrays table is constructed. Combustion dynamics model {{for each of the}} combination for the gearbox was simulated using ADVISOR software and FTP driving cycle. Efficient performance for the fuel consumption is obtained for the various levels of each gear ratio. Analysis of variances reveals that the significant factor effecting the fuel consumption is gear 5, followed by the differential gear and gear 3. According to the F values, the remaining factors, gear 1, 2 and 4 are not significant. The conclusions drawn during the analysis is validated with confirmation experiment using two different automobiles with power, 50 and 150  hp. Results obtained in this study demonstrate that the Taguchi experimental techniques can effectively predict the optimum gear ratio arrangements and facilitate the engine design process leading to improved fuel consumption.|$|R
