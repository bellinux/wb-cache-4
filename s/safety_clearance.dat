DMRC has stated that this was done to reduce the crowding on Blue line, diverting some of the Dwarka-bound passengers to Airport Express Line, which is underutilised and faster compared to the Blue Line.|$|E

50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the Golden Chariots never {{operated}} in regular service over Mount Royal, a small 764-foot high mountain {{that is the}} city's namesake. It was found that if passengers stood {{in some areas of}} the upper tiers of the Golden Chariots, there was not enough of a <b>safety</b> <b>clearance</b> in the tunnel on that line. Therefore the Company only used the Golden Chariots on the spectacular mountain right-of-way for occasional charter trips.

Both routes met at Summit Loop near today's Beaver Lake (Lac des Castors) Pavilion where Remembrance Road and the Camillien Houde Parkway meet. The 93-Remembrance route was one of the shortest in the city, being only about three-quarters of a mile long from its western terminus at Remembrance and Cote des Neiges Roads. While the 93-Remembrance route was a relatively straight line to Summit Loop, the 11-Mountain route was far more challenging.

Wind tunnel testing of store releases to assess forces and moments for <b>safety</b> and <b>clearance</b> must be conducted with a store mounted to an angled strut rather than a conventional rear sting, to allow the full range of motion as the store "drops" from inside the aircraft. Interference from this strut can disrupt the flowfields and thus the reliability of moments obtained, and therefore an investigation was conducted to quantify the potential extent of discrepancies; original small-scale transonic wind tunnel testing was undertaken in a limited program which was supported by extensive numerical work.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems [© Springer Science+Business Media B. V. ]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] The original publication is available at www. springerlink. com. The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in airspace requires new methods to certify collision avoidance systems. This paper presents a <b>safety</b> <b>clearance</b> process for obstacle avoidance systems, where worst case analysis is performed using simulation based optimization in the presence of all possible parameter variations. The clearance criterion for the UAV obstacle avoidance system is defined as the minimum distance from the aircraft to the obstacle during the collision avoidance maneuver. Local and global optimization based verification processes are developed to automatically search the worst combinations of the parameters and the worst-case distance between the UAV and an obstacle under all possible variations and uncertainties. Based on a 6 Degree of Freedom (6 DoF) kinematic and dynamic model of a UAV, the path planning and collision avoidance algorithms are developed in 3 D space. The artificial potential field method is chosen as a path planning and obstacle avoidance candidate technique for verification study as it is a simple and widely used method. Different optimization algorithms are applied and compared in terms of the reliability and efficiency...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: These {{guidelines}} update {{and extend}} evidence-based indications {{for the management}} of children with acute gastroenteritis in Europe. METHODS: The guideline development group formulated questions, identified data, and formulated recommendations. The latter were graded with the Muir Gray system and, in parallel, with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system. RESULTS: Gastroenteritis severity is linked to etiology, and rotavirus is the most severe infectious agent and is frequently associated with dehydration. Dehydration reflects severity and should be monitored by established score systems. Investigations are generally not needed. Oral rehydration with hypoosmolar solution is the major treatment and should start as soon as possible. Breast-feeding should not be interrupted. Regular feeding should continue with no dietary changes including milk. Data suggest that in the hospital setting, in non-breast-fed infants and young children, lactose-free feeds can be considered in the management of gastroenteritis. Active therapy may reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea. Effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii, diosmectite or racecadotril. Anti-infectious drugs should be given in exceptional cases. Ondansetron is effective against vomiting, but its routine use requires <b>safety</b> <b>clearance</b> given the warning about severe cardiac effects. Hospitalization should generally be reserved for children requiring enteral/parenteral rehydration; most cases may be managed in an outpatients setting. Enteral rehydration is superior to intravenous rehydration. Ultrarapid schemes of intravenous rehydration are not superior to standard schemes and may be associated with higher readmission rates.

40|$|Predictions of the {{parametric}} aircraft {{wake vortex}} transport and decay model P 2 P are compared with field observations. The two-phase decay model predicts probabilistic wake vortex {{behavior as a}} function of aircraft and environmental parameters in real time. Observation data from field deployments accomplished at the International Airports Memphis and Dallas Fort Worth, and from the WakeOP campaign performed at the airfield in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany are employed. In a scoring procedure, the predictive capabilities of a deterministic version of P 2 P are compared to Sarpkaya's model. Based on 211 Memphis cases, it is shown that the probabilistic model predicts conservative confidence intervals for vortex decay with the exception of four cases in which constant background wind shear increases vortex lifetime. Nonetheless, the aircraft spacing reduction potential based on vortex decay appears small. In contrast, consideration of advection outside the lateral limits of a safety corridor results in a large potential spacing reduction. Vortex drift is investigated based on input from different wind measurement devices with a focus on the spatial and temporal variability of the crosswind. <b>Safety</b> corridor <b>clearances</b> based on short term weather forecasts yield promising results.

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that the polyethylene glycol (PEG) corona of long-circulating polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) favors interaction with the amyloid-beta (A beta(1 - 42)) peptide both in solution and in serum. The influence of PEGylation of poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) and poly(lactic acid) NPs on the interaction with monomeric and soluble oligomeric forms of A beta(1 - 42) peptide was demonstrated by capillary electrophoresis, surface plasmon resonance, thioflavin T assay, and confocal microscopy, where the binding affected peptide aggregation kinetics. The capture of peptide by NPs in serum was also evidenced by fluorescence spectroscopy and ELISA. Moreover, in silico and modeling experiments highlighted the mode of PEG interaction with the A beta(1 - 42) peptide and its conformational changes at the nanoparticle surface. Finally, A beta(1 - 42) peptide binding to NPs affected neither complement activation in serum nor apolipoprotein-E (Apo-E) adsorption from the serum. These observations have crucial implications in NP <b>safety</b> and <b>clearance</b> kinetics from the blood. Apo-E deposition is of prime importance since it can also interact with the A beta(1 - 42) peptide and increase the affinity of NPs for the peptide in the blood.
