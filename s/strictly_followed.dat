Even if Nagumo had not <b>strictly</b> <b>followed</b> carrier doctrine, {{he could not have}} prevented the launch of the American attack.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{families}} were the norm but legal separations between brothers and even {{father and son}} have been recorded in inscriptions. Women and daughters had rights over property and land as there are inscriptions recording the sale of land by women. The arranged marriage system followed a strict policy of early marriage for women. Among Brahmins, boys married at or below 16 {{years of age and}} the brides chosen for them were 12 or younger. This age policy was not <b>strictly</b> <b>followed</b> by other castes. Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow would immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre) was practiced but the few examples noted in inscriptions were mostly in the royal families. The system of shaving the heads of widows was infrequent as epigraphs note that widows were allowed to grow their hair but decorating it was discouraged. The remarriage of a widow was rare among the upper castes and more accepted among the lower castes.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of sexual activity}} between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator {{is not necessary to}} identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as <b>strictly</b> <b>followed</b> {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E

25|$|Because {{there has}} been no Supreme Court {{decision}} on the issue of what exactly constitutes a “Use in Commerce” under the Lanham Act with regard to the incorporation of a trademark into a domain name, it is difficult to say whether the Bucci case is still good law.

One rule that was <b>strictly</b> <b>followed</b> was that each horse had its own harness, which was cleaned every time it was taken off. To ensure that the horses always had proper shoes, traveling horseshoers with portable forges visited the stage stations regularly.|$|E
25|$|On many occasions, the Chindits {{could not}} take their wounded with them; some were left behind in villages. Wingate had, in fact, issued {{specific}} orders to leave behind all wounded, but these orders were not <b>strictly</b> <b>followed.</b> Since there were often no established paths in the jungle along their routes, many times they had to clear their own with machetes and kukris (and on one occasion, a commandeered elephant). A single RAF squadron of six planes supplied them by air.|$|E

It is compulsory to remove the shoes before entering the temple, {{as a sign of}} respect of the Buddha, as is the practice in all other temples in Thailand. While offering prayers before the Buddha image, the sitting posture should avoid any offensive stretching of feet towards the deity; the feet should be tucked in towards the back.|$|E

25|$|The use {{and making}} of icons entered Kievan Rus' {{following}} its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons <b>strictly</b> <b>followed</b> models and formulas hallowed by usage, {{some of which}} had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians—notably Andrei Rublev and Dionisius—widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when Simon Ushakov's painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the Bulgarian Patriarchate followed {{the traditions of the}} First Empire. The head of the Church was the Patriarch of Bulgaria, {{who was a member of}} the State Council (Sinklit) and was at times a regent. The patriarch was assisted by a Synod comprising bishops, high-ranking clerics, and sometimes representatives of secular authorities. The Bulgarian Church <b>strictly</b> <b>followed</b> official state policy—Patriarch Joachim III was executed for treason because of suspected links with the Mongols. The territorial extent of the Bulgarian Patriarchate varied according to territorial changes. At its height under the reign of Ivan Asen II (r. 1218–41), it consisted of 14 dioceses; Preslav, Cherven, Lovech, Sofia, Ovech, Drastar, Vidin, Serres, Philippi, Messembria, Braničevo, Belgrade, Niš, and Velbazhd; and the sees of Tarnovo and Ohrid.|$|E
25|$|To {{prove the}} antiquity and {{authenticity}} of their claims, the Beta Israel cite the 9th-century CE testimony of Eldad ha-Dani (the Danite), {{from a time}} before the Zagwean dynasty was established. Eldad was a Jewish man of dark skin who appeared in Egypt and created a stir in that Jewish community (and elsewhere in the Mediterranean Jewish communities he visited) with claims {{that he had come}} from a Jewish kingdom of pastoralists far to the south. The only language Eldad spoke was a hitherto unknown dialect of Hebrew. Although he <b>strictly</b> <b>followed</b> the Mosaic commandments, his observance differed in some details from Rabbinic halakhah. Some observers thought that he might be a Karaite, although his practice also differed from theirs. He carried Hebrew books that supported his explanations of halakhah. He cited ancient authorities in the scholarly traditions of his own people.|$|E

25|$|Charles Simonyi, {{who worked}} at Xerox PARC in the 1970s and later oversaw the {{creation}} of Microsoft's Office suite of applications, invented and taught the use of Hungarian Notation, one version of which uses the lower case letter(s) {{at the start of}} a (capitalized) variable name to denote its type. One account claims that the camel case style first became popular at Xerox PARC around 1978, with the Mesa programming language developed for the Xerox Alto computer. This machine lacked an underscore key, and the hyphen and space characters were not permitted in identifiers, leaving camel case as the only viable scheme for readable multiword names. The PARC Mesa Language Manual (1979) included a coding standard with specific rules for upper and lower camel case that was <b>strictly</b> <b>followed</b> by the Mesa libraries and the Alto operating system.|$|E

Eliot said: [...] "It is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method."
