Besides the coupe's backbone window, the two simulated air intakes were eliminated from the hood, though their indentations remained. Also, the decorative air-exhaust vent on the coupe's rear pillar was made functional, but only on the left side. The car's rocker-panel trim {{lost some of its}} ribs and gained black paint between those ribs that remained; wheel covers were simplified; and the fuel filler/deck emblem gained concentric circles around its crossed-flags insignia. Inside, the original color-keyed <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> was now done in simulated walnut.|$|E
25|$|The Bennett {{fracture}} is {{an oblique}} intraarticular metacarpal fracture dislocation, {{caused by an}} axial force directed against the partially flexed metacarpal. This type of compression along the metacarpal bone is often sustained when a person punches a hard object, such as the skull or tibia of an opponent, or a wall. It can also occur {{as a result of}} a fall onto the thumb. This is a common injury sustained from bike falls, as the thumb is generally extended while around the handle bars. It is also a common injury in car crashes, especially into fixed objects, from the driver holding the steering wheel during impact. The hand moves forward, while the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> hyperextends the thumb.|$|E

5000|$|The Club as {{originally}} designed {{was prone to}} having its lock shattered by freezing with freon; later models addressed this issue by changing to a chromium/molybdenum alloy. A television broadcast test showed that this form of attack now took several minutes of hammering. The most grievous flaw in the design {{is inherent in the}} modern construction of steering wheels; thieves can defeat this type of lock by cutting away part of the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel's</b> <b>rim,</b> allowing the device to be removed. This does, however, require access to a hacksaw or other cutting tool, and ruins the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> However, after the Club has been removed, {{it can be used to}} assist the thief in breaking the steering lock built into the steering column; some thieves target cars [...] "protected" [...] with the Club over other cars for this reason.|$|R
2500|$|The SEL line {{received}} a few upgrades for 2003, {{to give it}} a more upscale image. Among the changes were a new instrument cluster, wheels, as well as a slight redesign of the dash, with woodgrain replacing the black trim. It also got woodgrain on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> and around the power window switches on the front doors. Also in 2003, Ford created a Centennial Edition Taurus to celebrate Ford's 100th anniversary. This special Taurus included many extras, such as lighter wood trim, special leather seats, headlights with black accents, special wheels, a special leather case for the owner's manual, a leather jacket that said [...] "Ford: 100 Years", a similar watch, and a letter from William Clay Ford, Jr. Production was limited to 4,000 units.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{media event}} on February 28, 2011, Holden {{unveiled}} the Australian assembled Cruze sedan in facelifted [...] "Series II" [...] guise, {{otherwise known as}} the JH series. Prime Minister Julia Gillard attended the February launch to drive the first example off Holden's production line before full-scale production commenced in March. Holden has confirmed an initial local content level of between 40 and 50percent if assessed by retail value, with an aim of increasing Cruze localization over time. Series II styling revisions to the grille, lower air intake, and bumper have softened the front-end to bear a closer resemblance to Holden's larger VE II Commodore. Further differentiation from the original has been achieved via the fitment of amber front indicator lights, jewelled bezel headlamps, remodelled wheel trims, and through adjustments to the lower portion of the rear bumper. Carrying over largely unchanged is the 1.8-liter petrol inline-four, tweaked to yield slight enhancements in drivability. When automatic transmission is specified, the 1.8-liter is now teamed with GM's six-speed 6T30 unit, lighter and more compact than the previous 6T40. Diesel remains optional for [...] "CD" [...] and [...] "CDX" [...] specifications over the standard 1.8-liter petrol. Alterations to the 2.0-liter turbodiesel have resulted in an additional [...] and [...] and a slight reduction in fuel consumption for the manual variant, now a six-speed unit. However, the headline change is {{the release of the}} turbocharged 1.4-liter engine, dubbed iTi by Holden for intelligent turbo induction. The inclusion of the 1.4 also brings an upgrade to electric (as opposed to hydraulic) power steering and affixes a Watt's linkage to the torsion beam rear suspension. Linked with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions, the 1.4 is fitted as standard to the new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] sports-oriented trims, but is available at extra cost on the base [...] "CD". The new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] models have their respective badges embossed onto the grille insert, are fitted with their own front bumper design, and feature side skirts, chrome exterior door handles, a rear lip spoiler, and five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels. Over the [...] "CD", [...] "SRi" [...] gains a leather-covered <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> and shift lever, with the [...] "SRi-V" [...] extending this upholstering to the seating. A heat function for the front seats, keyless entry with push-button engine start, reversing sensors, and seven-inch LCD multimedia unit are also part of the [...] "SRi-V" [...] equipment list. This multimedia system integrates satellite navigation, the CD and DVD players, and a 10GB internal hard disk drive. In mid-November 2011, Holden released the MY12 update to the Series II Cruze. This update coincided with the release of the hatchback body variant and saw Bluetooth telephone connectivity standard across the range.|$|E

5000|$|A Grand Sport Rally Pack {{was offered}} on Falcon, Falcon 500 and Fairmont models. The XA GS had rally stripes that {{ran from the}} front {{indicators}} {{to the end of}} the rear doors. It also shared many options as used on the GT Falcon, such as the 12 slot steel wheels with plain brushed centre caps, the three spoke wooden rimmed <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with <b>rim</b> squeeze horn and full GT dash instrumentation featuring tachometer, odometer, oil pressure, water temperature and voltmeter as standard. For the first time the GS model range was also available as a two-door hardtop and was also offered as an option on utes and panel vans. A [...] two barrel version of the 351 cuin L Cleveland V8 was also available as an option on the GS sedans only. The GS could also be fitted with the Option 56 ‘driving lights’ grille which was standard on the GT, however, the GT bonnet with NACA style ducts was not available as an option on the XA GS.|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} engine, the plastic tortoise-shell <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> was later {{used on the}} Chrysler 300C.

50|$|In theory, {{the idea}} of the Teletouch system made sense, but in its execution, the system quickly became the bane of the Edsel and its owners. Many new car buyers, and most {{automotive}} writers, found Teletouch to be a gimmick, while others found it distracting or confusing. Despite its marketing talking points, it required the driver to remove a hand from the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> to push a center-pod button.|$|E
50|$|The first button {{added to}} the {{steering}} wheel was a switch to activate the car's electric horn. Traditionally located {{on the steering wheel}} hub or center pad, the horn switch was sometimes placed on the spokes or activated via a decorative horn ring which obviated the necessity to move a hand away from the rim. Electrical connections are made via a slip ring. A further development, the Rim Blow steering wheel, integrated the horn switch into the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>rim.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In the July 1978 issue, Consumer Reports {{rated the}} Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon {{automobile}} [...] "not acceptable", {{the first car}} it had judged such since the AMC Ambassador in 1968.

5000|$|Camaro Challenge: The Mega-Challenge: For what Andrew {{claims to}} be the show's most {{demanding}} Mega-Challenge yet, the drivers will each begin with a combined Eye of the Needle and Slalom, which ends in an Icy Corner that they have to safely negotiate. The drivers then have to navigate a forward section of <b>wheel</b> <b>rims,</b> then turn the car around in a space enclosed by concrete barriers, before ending the challenge with a reverse-flick. Sly goes first and hits nearly every arch and foam person in the initial section, then fails the Icy Corner. He then hits a lot of <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> in the forward section, dents and scrapes the Camaro in the concrete turning space, and knocks over even more <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> in the reversing section. After getting wedged on some rims, he gets out to remove them, but accidentally leaves the Camaro in reverse, resulting in it taking off without him and not stopping until it gets wedged on more rims. Finally, Sly attempts the reverse flick far too late and understeers, ensuring a total failure in every aspect of the challenge. Kevin gets off to a great start, and performs both the Eye of the Needle/Slalom combo and the Icy Corner flawlessly, causing Andrew to congratulate him just before he begins the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> section. His congratulations prove premature however, as Kevin starts knocking down the rims, and his mounting stress causes the run to rapidly fall apart, with Kevin again heavily scraping the car while turning it around, knocking down even more <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> in reverse, and then getting the reverse flick spectacularly wrong and destroying the left-hand side of the turning area. Michael has the final run, and gets the initial straight right without hitting any arches or foam people, but then fails the Icy Corner. Like Kevin, his mounting stress then causes him to start knocking down the wheel rims; he at least turns the Camaro around without hitting anything, but continues to knock down rims in the reverse section, and then fails the reverse flick when he turns the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> the wrong way, leaving Michael visibly angry with himself.|$|R

50|$|It is a {{customization}} programme {{based on}} the works on GranTurismo MC Concept. Changes include front and rear carbon-fibre spoilers, carbon fibre mirror housings and door handles, 20 inch wheel rims, carbon fibre interior (<b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>rim,</b> paddle shifters, instrument panel, dashboard, door panels), stiffer springs, shock absorbers and anti-roll bars with custom Maserati Stability Programme software and 10 mm lower height than GranTurismo S. The programme was initially offered in GranTurismo S, with the product line expanded to all GranTurismo vehicle and all Maserati vehicles in 2009.

5000|$|The rim blow wheel was {{available}} {{in place of the}} traditional button-type or suspended ring used to activate the vehicle's horn. Some models such as the AMC AMX featured the new design as standard equipment, or it was optional such as on the compact AMC Hornet for an additional $37. A rubber pad encasing wires was mounted around the entire inner surface of the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>rim.</b> Rather than pressing a suspended horn ring, a center horn pad, or switches on the spokes, to make the electrical contact, the inside of the rim could be pressed anywhere on its circumference. Applying pressure to soft rubber inner rim of the steering wheel, a driver could activate the car's horn without moving their hands from the wheel rims.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} spokes in the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> has {{continuously}} changed. Most early cars had four-spoke <b>steering</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned more to get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> A lower <b>steering</b> ratio means that the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher {{steering ratio}}, which will make the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is therefore harder to turn.|$|R
