A year later, El 11.2092 was also taken into use after a similar rebuild. El 9 remained in sporadic use until 1989. Class 69 electric multiple units were taken into use starting on 10 August 1982. These had been allocated to Bergen District for use on the Bergen Commuter Rail, and were also used on the direct trains between Bergen and Flåm. The main disadvantage with the class was the small windows, as the trains were designed for commuter traffic rather than sight-seeing.|$|E

Three-dimensional CFD studies of the mean airflow over various research ships and a generic tanker/bulk carrier have been performed.

Even for anemometers in well-exposed locations on research ships the wind speed may be biased by about 10 %.

40|$|Acquisition of {{accurate}} raindrop fall <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> {{outdoors in}} natural rain {{by means of}} moderate-cost and easy-to-use devices represents a long-standing and challenging issue in the meteorological community. Feasibility experiments were conducted to evaluate the indoor accuracy of fall <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> made with a high-speed camera and to evaluate its capability for outdoor applications. An indoor experiment operating in calm conditions showed that the high-speed imaging technique can provide fall <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> with a mean error of 4. 1 – 9. 7  % compared to Gunn and Kinzer's empirical fall-speed–size relationship for typical sizes of rain and drizzle drops. Results obtained using the same apparatus outside in summer afternoon showers indicated larger positive and negative velocity deviations compared to the indoor measurements. These observed deviations suggest that ambient flow and turbulence {{play a role in}} modifying drop fall speeds which can be quantified with future outdoor high-speed camera measurements.

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{is the use}} of applied mathematics, physics, and computational software to visualize how a fluid flows around objects. CFD is based on the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe how the velocity, pressure, temperature, and density of a moving fluid are related. Here CFD is used to simulate the errors in wind <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> caused by flow distortion on two research vessels: the R/V Celtic Explorer and the R/V Knorr. The numerical measurements were obtained from the finite volume CFD code OpenFOAM, which was used to simulate the required velocity fields. From the simulations, the following were determined: (i) the ideal anemometer location for wind <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> on these vessels (ii) the effect of varying vessel pitch angles on measurement data (iii) the optimum experimental design by testing two mast designs with three instrumentation setups (iv) the flow distortion effects for wind <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> of Â± 60 Âº to the bow for 5 - 20 m s- 1. A new parameter in flow distortion error wind speed dependence was defined. Furthermore, a correction function for the in-situ wind <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> at anemometer measurement locations using the theoretical CFD model was derived. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and large eddy simulation (LES) simulation models accuracy at predicting air-flow distortion error was compared, and the latter was found to be superior. The wind vector pitch and yaw in wind <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> due to air-flow distortion was quantified, and a definition of the underlying cause of the aforementioned wind speed dependence was provided. A correction function and methodology was provided that will lead to a mean accuracy of 3 % and define a correction for wave induced flow distortion errors both experimentally and numerically. Finally a variety of CFD studies are presented that have been conducted involving the Air-Sea Interaction Profiler (ASIP), the flow distortion correction of wind speed parameterized air-sea fluxes, and the flow distortion effects associated with the logarithmic wind speed profiles application to off-shore renewable energies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{the authors}} face {{the problem of}} wind speed {{processing}} as environmental variable of a wind turbine system. Generally, the information on wind <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> is processed {{over long periods of}} time to be relevant with respect to the site characteristics (average and maximum speeds, statistics). Subsequent large scale profiles of wind speed lead to long processing time for simulation analysis and especially for optimization design that penalizes the search of optimal solutions. An original synthesis approach of a compact and representative wind speed profile using an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is proposed. This approach is compared to a purely statistical approach based on random number generators. It allows reducing the actual wind profile duration with compression ratios greater (two months of wind <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> are compressed in only 1 hour). Then, the synthesis approach by EA is applied to the sizing of an autonomous hybrid system based on wind turbine with battery storage for stand-alone energy systems. It has proven its effectiveness in reducing 200 days of wind <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> in only 10 days, allowing sizing the storage system with a significant gain in terms of computing time in the framework of the optimization process...|$|R
