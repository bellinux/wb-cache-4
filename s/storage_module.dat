25|$|Leonardo Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) is a <b>storage</b> <b>module</b> {{attached}} to the Tranquility node. The three NASA Space Shuttle MPLM cargo containers—Leonardo, Raffaello and Donatello—were built for NASA in Turin, Italy by Alcatel Alenia Space, now Thales Alenia Space. The MPLMs were provided to NASA's ISS programme by Italy (independent of their role as a member state of ESA) and {{are considered to be}} US elements. In a bartered exchange for providing these containers, the US gave Italy research time aboard the ISS out of the US allotment in addition to that which Italy receives as a member of ESA. The Permanent Multipurpose Module was created by converting Leonardo into a module that could be permanently {{attached to}} the station.|$|E

A non-removable media variant family of 12, 24 and 48 MB capacity, the MMD, was then announced in 1976.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the hydroelastic responses and hydrodynamic interactions of two large floating fuel <b>storage</b> <b>modules</b> placed side-by-side with the presence of floating breakwaters. These modules and breakwaters form the floating fuel storage facility (FFSF). The floating <b>storage</b> <b>modules</b> and breakwaters are modeled as plates and the linear wave theory is used to model the water waves in the numerical model. The numerical model is verified with existing numerical results and validated with experimental test. Numerical simulations are performed to determine the hydroelastic behavior and hydrodynamic interactions of floating <b>storage</b> <b>modules</b> placed adjacent to each other and enclosed by floating breakwaters under various incident wave angles. The effects of breakwaters, drafts, channel spacing formed by the two adjacent modules and water depth on the hydroelastic responses of the modules are investigated. The wave induced responses of multiple floating <b>storage</b> <b>modules</b> enclosed by floating breakwaters are also examined...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} design of a readout system for a silicon {{calorimeter}} with 12800 readout channels, to be operated on satellite or balloon-borne experiments for cosmic antiproton and antihelium search. A prototype of the calorimeter digital readout system has been designed and constructed. It may be subdivided into two main parts: the <b>storage</b> <b>modules</b> and the controller. Performance tests of the prototype at the acquisition rate of 8 MHz result in a very limited power consumption, amounting to 0. 1 mW per channel for the <b>Storage</b> <b>Modules</b> and 0. 5 W for the controller. The acquisition rate can be further enhanced by simple modifications of the transmission protocol between the <b>storage</b> <b>modules</b> and the controller.

Later in production, an option for installation of a miniature hard drive was provided (See MSM, or Mass <b>Storage</b> <b>Module,</b> below). The Unisite is the only programmer that still requires true 720k floppies for non-MSM operation, or updating the MSM's software without the aid of external PC-based software.|$|E
