40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess the changes of content of essential organic nutrients, yeasts and moulds and effect of aerobic fermentation when the fresh (untreated) and treated brewers grains (BG) is stored in the stall conditions. Both the fresh brewers grains from Radegast brewery and that treated by mixture of sodium benzoate (22. 9 %) sodium propionate (8. 3 %) and following 90 days anaerobic fermentation were mounded in the entrance of stall and tested in two tests, one during the winter period in February, the other one during the summer period in June. Influence of treatment was evident on the process of fermentation, levels of the nitrogen-free extract substances (NFES) and number of forming colony units (FCU) of moulds in the winter period. The fermentation activities in both tested masses were documented, however the decrease of intent of NFES in treated variants was highly conclusive (P < 0. 01) lower than that of untreated variants. Stagnation of increase of formol titration in treated BG matches the same tendency. Significant (P < 0. 01) limitation of mould growth was noted at treated BG, the number of FCU of moulds stagnated since 1 st to 5 th to day of testing. On the other hand the number of FCU of moulds in untreated BG was redoubled after 4 days since the start of testing. Treatment influenced monitored parameters above all in the early gout after the start of tes­ting. NFES content in untreated BG in February statistically highly conclusive (P < 0. 01) fell from ave­rage values 502. 99 ± 8. 704 in 1 st day of testing on 437. 533 ± 18. 877 g .  kg dry matter in 6 th day of testing while at treated BG was fall behind the same period only conclusive (P < 0. 05). There was ascertained highly conclusive growth (P < 0. 01) of level of formol titration from 0. 004 ± 0. 001 in 1 st day to 0. 178 ± 0. 038 in 6 th day of the same testing at untreated BG, while the level of formol titration stagnated at treated BG. In June content of NFES at untreated BG statistically conclusive (P < 0. 05) declined from 455. 578 ± 9. 515 in 1 st day on 432. 92 ± 9. 515 g .  kg dry mater in 5 th day of testing. Near NFES content at treated BG statistically conclusive (P < 0. 05) declined as late as 7 th day. Alike formol titration level at untreated BG surged from 0. 008 ± 0. 001 in 1 st day on 0. 087 ± 0. 036 in 5 th day, on the contrary at treated BG come to statistically highly conclusive (P < 0. 01) growth as late as 7 th day of testing. Both monitoring demonstrate that the treatment of BG by mixture of sodium benzoate (22. 9 %) and sodium propionate (8. 3 %) and its subsequent 90 day anaerobic fermentation will reduce activity of moulds and fall of included NFES and retarded resolution of protein on subsequent manipulation up deliver form <b>silage</b> <b>bag</b> and during a short-period storage in stall...|$|E

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{physical model}} of {{a new type of}} anaerobic fermenter for “dry” and “wet” anaerobic digestion consisting of <b>silage</b> <b>bags</b> was designed. In the model, the experiment based on high-solids discontinuous anaerobic co-fermentation of agricultural substrates was carried out. It was verified that a horizontal fermenter constructed from <b>silage</b> <b>bags</b> is a suitable type of equipment for the production of biogas. The biogas production peaked at 4 th day and was completed by 18 th day. Within 18 days of discontinuous high-solids process (18. 5 - 20. 0 wt. %TS) the intensity of biogas production reached 1. 18 mN 3. m- 3. d- 1, or 0. 0012 mN 3. kg- 1. d- 1, and the specific methane production 0. 01 mN 3. kg- 1, or 0. 07 mN 3. kgVS- 1. After conversion of the modeling process to a semi-continuous low-solids mode (3. 5 - 5. 5 wt. %TS) during the daily dosage of 87 wt % mixture of biscuit meal EKPO-EB with 13 wt % CaO, the intensity of biogas production reached the value 2. 42 mN 3. m- 3. d- 1, or 0. 0105 mN 3. kg- 1. d- 1.

40|$|Preface. This {{report is}} a product of the Cornell “open burning group, ” which formed in Winter 2002 to assess the extent and {{environmental}} health significance of open burning of household wastes and agricultural plastics in New York State (NYS), and begin work towards reducing these practices in order to protect public health and the environment. The report focuses on disposal of agricultural plastics—rather than on the household waste stream—for reasons that include the importance of agriculture in NY and the role of Cornell’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in working with NYS agriculture and the environment. Background and rationale. Plastics (LDPE, HDPE, polystyrene resins) have become ubiquitous in agriculture: In dairy farming they are used as <b>silage</b> <b>bags,</b> bunker silo covers, bale wraps and twines; in nurseries and ornamental horticulture they are used as hoophouse covers, trays and containers; in fruit and vegetable production, as row covers and mulch films. Plastic pesticide containers are used in all sectors of agriculture. Increasingly, plastics are substituted for the longer lasting materials previously used in agriculture (e. g., <b>silage</b> <b>bags</b> in place of concrete silos, plastic hoop houses in place of glass green houses) because of production efficiency and economics. More than half the plastics are disposed by burning onfarm, with most of the remainder buried or dumped on-farm. Due to inefficiencies of open combustion, emissions from open burning are much greater per mass of material burned than emissions from controlled incineration (e. g., 20 times as much dioxin, 40 times as much particulate matter). These emissions pose risks to human health...|$|R
40|$|Silage is an {{important}} feed ingredient for dairy cattle. Dairy producers must strive to deliver high quality forage in an economical manner to the cows. The “most economical manner ” may not necessarily mean the lowest cost per ton of silage fed. It refers to {{the economics of the}} silage after accounting for the impact it might have on milk production (income) along with costs associated with producing, harvesting, storing, and feeding the silage. The lowest cost per ton should only be the goal if a milk-production-per-ton-adjustment has been made. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a framework for comparing the economics of three different types of silage storage structures. The framework includes procedures for evaluating bunker silos, drive-over or wall-less piles, and <b>silage</b> <b>bags.</b> A companion Excel spreadsheet (SilageStorage$. xls) is available a...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the parameters related to the digestion of the fiber from silages of four corn hybrids (BX 1280, SHS 4070, 2 B 433, and DKB 390) developed for silage production. Four rumen-cannulated castrated Holstein × Zebu crossbred cattle with approximate initial weight of 400 kg were distributed in a Latin square design. To determine the fiber passage rate and degradability, the techniques of chromium-mordant and in situ incubation of the neutral detergent fiber of the <b>silages</b> in nylon <b>bags</b> were used. The profiles of concentration of the marker in the feces were described by the generalized two-compartment model.

40|$|R. obtusifolius L. seeds were {{collected}} on Aug. 25 th, 1983, and devided into two groups, i. e., mature seeds of brown perianth and immature seeds of green perianth. Some samples of both groups were buried in {{the central part of}} various 60 kg <b>bag</b> <b>silages</b> with and without additives and wilted. The material used for silages was the mixture of orchard grass, tall fescue and some other temperate grasses and its average dry matter percentage was 41. 2. At the same time, some seeds were dried in the sun and stored in the room. Silos were opened after 38 days and seeds were taken out and sent for germination test. Germination percentage of the solar dried seeds showed little difference with that at the collection in respect to mature and immature seeds. On the other hand, in the process of storage, the viability of seeds was almost lost in immature seeds and decreased in mature seeds, this being most in silage added with 0. 5 % formic acid and least in wilted silage. 本実験は,牧草の乾草調製及びサイレージ調製が刈取った牧草中に混入するエゾノギシギシ種子の発芽率におよぼす影響を明らかにしようとしたものである. エゾノギシギシ種子を採取し,花被が褐色の完熟種子と緑色の未熟種子に分別した. これらの種子を調製法及び添加物の異なる 6 種類のサイレージ中に埋蔵し 38 日間貯蔵した. サイレージ材料草は,オーチャードグラスを主体とした寒地型イネ科草で,その平均乾物含有率は 41. 2 %であった. 採取した種子の一部は,乾草調製を想定し 3 日間天日乾燥後室内に保存した. 採取直後の種子,天日乾燥種子及びサイレージ中埋蔵種子の発芽試験の結果は次のとおりである. 天日乾燥種子の発芽率は,未熟種子,完熟種子ともに採取直後のそれと同様の値であった. サイレージ中埋蔵種子については,未熟種子はほとんど発芽力を失うようであり,完熟種子も顕著な発芽率の低下を示した. このようなサイレージ中埋蔵による発芽率抑制効巣は, サイレージの種類によってその程度が異なり,予乾サイレージでやや小さく,ギ酸添加サイレージで最も大きかった. 本実験の結果から,サイレージ調製は刈取った牧草中に混入するエゾノギシギシ種子の発芽率を顕著に低下させ,家畜の糞中に排推される種子による本草の革地内拡散を抑制するうえで有効であることが認められた...|$|R
40|$|To date, silage {{adoption}} {{has been}} {{low in the}} tropics, particularly under smallholder conditions. Innovation and adoption processes of silage technologies were promoted in drought-constrained areas of Honduras using a flexible, site-specific and participatory research and extension approach. A total of about 250 farmers participated in training workshops and field days conducted in 13 locations. Smallholders successfully ensiled maize, sorghum and/or Pennisetum spp., mainly in heap and earth silos, while adoption of little <b>bag</b> <b>silage</b> (LBS) was low. LBS proved useful as a demonstration, experimentation and learning tool. A ‘silage boom’ occurred in 5 locations, where favorable adoption conditions included the presence of demonstration farms and involvement of key innovators, lack of alternative dry season feeds, perceived benefits of silage feeding, a favorable milk market and both extension continuity and intensity. The lack of chopping equipment was {{the main reason for}} non-adoption by poor smallholders. The study showed that, when targeting production system needs and farmer demands, silage promotion can lead to significant adoption, including at smallholder level, in the tropics. This experience could contribute to an increase in effectiveness and sustainability of silage extension in similar situations elsewhere. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{injection}} of anhydrous ammonia (A-NH 3) into <b>bagged</b> <b>silage</b> would allow variable applications of N to improve {{crude protein content}} of feeds. Trials evaluated the effectiveness of A-NH 3 injection into silage for changes in nutrient characteristics and to evaluate animal preference. In Trial 1, A-NH 3 was injected into a 30 t polyethylene <b>bag</b> of sorghum <b>silage</b> at 1 % DM. Injection was easily accomplished; the A-NH 3 moved some vertically and horizontally, but movement was limited, likely due to excessive moisture in the silage. In Trial II, polyethylene bags with 10 lb of forage were injected with 0, 1 or 2 % A-NH 3 on a DM basis and injected either pre-ensiling with or without corn or post-ensiling. Silage quality was improved {{with higher levels of}} A-NH 3. Injection of A-NH 3 during pre-ensiling stage of fermentation improved (P. 05) on characteristics, but A-NH 3 volatilization losses occurred during injection. Holstein heifers fed various treated silage combinations showed no refusals, indicating acceptable silages. Treating silages with A-NH 3 shows potential as a method of increasing CP of silages and improving diet digestibility, but issues of optimum moisture content in silages and timing should be addressed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Bag silos made {{at three}} {{research}} farms in 2000 and 2001 were monitored at filling and emptying to determine densities and losses. A total of 47 bags (23 alfalfa, 1 red clover, 23 whole−plant corn) were made, and losses were calculated on 39 of the silos. Dry matter (DM) density ranged from 160 to 270 kg/m 3. Dry matter density increased with DM content in hay crop silages on average 2. 9 kg/m 3 − % DM, whereas the effect in corn <b>silage</b> varied by <b>bagging</b> machine. Density decreased with increasing particle size at 4. 1 kg DM/m 3 per mm. The operator and the bagging machine setup both affected density. A wide range (0 % to 40 %) of DM losses was observed. Average DM losses were 9. 2 % invisible plus uncollected losses and 5. 4 % spoilage losses, {{for a total}} loss of 14. 6 %. Six silos had excessive spoilage losses of more than 15 % and total losses above 25 % due to plastic integrity issues or overly dry silage (> 40 % DM) being fed out in warm weather. Invisible losses were reduced in high−porosity silages (where spoilage losses were exacerbated), greater in warm weather, and affected by emptying procedures. Spoilage losses in bags without plastic integrity issues were greater in dry silages, from emptying silos in warm weather, at lower feed−out rates, in bags stored for a long time, and if bags were emptied periodically rather than daily...|$|R
40|$|Fodder beets (Beta vulgaris L.) are {{especially}} respected for their high feeding value and high netto-energy yield per hectare. The price per nutritive value is lowest {{as compared to}} other forages. Preservation of fodders beets demands thorough cleaning without damaging and regularly occurs as a whole in well closed piles. In addition, feeding them to the animals is labour demanding. These disadvantages enforce the research towards other preservation methods which {{may be able to}} valorise this valuable type of roughage. The preservation of fodder beets in <b>silages</b> using silo <b>bags,</b> either separately or in combination with maize was investigated. Fodder beets were harvested and ensilaged at the ideal moment of maize harvest (October) or fodder beets were harvested at the ideal moment for fodder beet harvest (November) and consequently ensilaged with previously ensilaged maize. Highest energy yields of the silages were recorded at optimal harvest time for fodder beets. Ensilaging fodder beets separately resulted in large energy losses due to effluent and dry matter losses. Using lab scale silage, possible solutions for these large losses were investigated. Addition of 10 % maize did reduce the effluent losses but dry matter losses remained at a high level. Addition of 4, 5 l propionic acid per ton beets reduced effluent and dry matter losses sufficiently. Ensilaging foliage was another point of interest. This appeared to result in a lowered energy yield at organic and dry matter basis, an increased amount of ashes and doubling of the iron (Fe) concentration. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Gamogofa zone, southern Ethiopia, located 445 - 505 km south of Addis Ababa. The area is semi-arid lowland with altitudes ranging from 746 to 1450 m asl and mean temperature ranges from 22 to 25 °C. The dominant farming system is mixed crop-livestock. Cattle, goats and poultry are the major livestock species, while maize, sorghum, teff, banana and mango are the major crops. Cattle fattening is an important undertaking and source of livelihoods. However, the fattening system is traditional low-input-low-output and producers are not benefiting much from the sector. This study evaluated the challenges and constraints, and cattle fattening innovations introduced through the participation of stakeholders in the study area. The study used focus group discussion, key informants interview, livestock commodity platforms and questionnaires for data collection. The major challenges and constraints identified are; a) feed and feeding related - lack of improved fodder and poor utilisation, lack of fodder conservation practices, poor natural grazing lands management and energy loss due to long distance grazing; lack of access for concentrate feed; b) cattle related - inappropriate cattle type for fattening; c) production related - long cycle fattening (> 8 months), poor housing and poor cattle management; d) market related - unorganised cattle marking, dominance of local markets with brokers which makes producers price takers, lack of market linkage; e) capacity related - lack of knowledge and skill on improved cattle fattening by producers, input providers and livestock extension staff. The following interventions were introduced: a) capacity related, which includes skill based training and coaching & mentoring of producers and livestock extension staff on improved cattle fattening, improved reproductive management and artificial insemination; b) fattening innovations which includes stall feeding instead of grazing, short cycle (3 - 4 months) multiple fattening per annum, improved on farm fodder production, improved fodder utilisation through chopping, fodder conservation through <b>bag</b> <b>silage</b> making & proper harvesting and storage of crop residues, initiation of commercial concentrate feed supplying business and use of concentrate supplementation, better animal selection from the market and deworming before fattening, establishment of fattened cattle marketing groups, and marketing linkage with buyers.
