5000|$|The {{incumbent}} {{local exchange}} carrier in 604 and 778 is Telus. Through [...] "number portability" [...] and <b>sub-allocation</b> of all numbers in some exchanges to a competitor, many {{numbers in the}} 778 area code are now serviced by Shaw Cablesystems.|$|E
5000|$|The PL/I [...] I/O {{statements}} {{have relatively}} simple syntax {{as they do}} not offer options for the many situations from end-of-file to record transmission errors that can occur when a record is read or written. Instead, these complexities are handled in the ON-units for the various file conditions. The same approach was adopted for [...] <b>sub-allocation</b> and the [...] condition.|$|E
5000|$|Because ext3 aims to be backward-compatible {{with the}} earlier ext2, many of the on-disk {{structures}} {{are similar to those}} of ext2. Consequently, ext3 lacks recent features, such as extents, dynamic allocation of inodes, and block <b>sub-allocation.</b> A directory can have at most 31998 subdirectories, because an inode can have at most 32,000 links (each direct subdirectory increases their parent folder inode link counter in the [...] ".."

30|$|The {{cybercrime}} hosting {{infrastructure is}} a basic building block of the cyber-crime ecosystem. It provides servers and networking infrastructure for the cyber criminals, and it also persist {{in the face of}} takedown attempts and complaints of illicit activities. Alrwais et al. (Alrwais et al. 2014) investigated a trending and stealthy cybercrime hosting service, that malicious activities were hosted on the <b>sub-allocations</b> of legitimate service provider Networks. Li et al. (Li et al. 2013) also found that Internet Service Provider (ISP) were used for abusive hosting. Compared with those prior studies, we shed light on the emerging and evasive cybercrime hosting platform: cloud service, which has never been studied before.|$|R
40|$|This DEIS is {{prepared}} {{pursuant to the}} National Environmental Policy Act to assess the environmental impacts associated with a regulatory action. The DEIS analyzes the impacts of a reasonable range of alternatives intended to address approaches to regional management for the recreational harvest of red snapper, including delegating limited management authority to the Gulf of Mexico states. This may include the authority to establish size limits, bag limits, seasons, closed areas, and <b>sub-allocations</b> for the private and for-hire vessels. The purpose of this action is to provide flexibility {{in the management of}} the recreational red snapper component in the reef fish fishery by reorganizing the federal fishery management strategy, modifying the for-hire permit provisions, and developing AMs for recreational overages to better account for biological, social, and economic differences among the regions of the Gulf.

40|$|The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a 6. 6 m diameter, segmented, {{deployable}} telescope for cryogenic IR {{space astronomy}} (approximately 40 K). The JWST Observatory architecture includes the Optical Telescope Element and the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) element that contains four science instruments (SI) including a Guider. The ISM optical metering structure is a roughly 2. 2 x 1. 7 x 2. 2 m, asymmetric frame that {{is composed of}} carbon fiber and resin tubes bonded to invar end fittings and composite gussets and clips. The structure supports the SIs, isolates the SIs from the OTE, and supports thermal and electrical subsystems. The structure {{is attached to the}} OTE structure via strut-like kinematic mounts. The ISIM structure must meet its requirements at the approximately 40 K cryogenic operating temperature. The SIs are aligned to the structure's coordinate system under ambient, clean room conditions using laser tracker and theodolite metrology. The ISIM structure is thermally cycled for stress relief and in order to measure temperature-induced mechanical, structural changes. These ambient-to-cryogenic changes in the alignment of SI and OTE-related interfaces are an important component in the JWST Observatory alignment plan and must be verified. We report on the planning for and preliminary testing of a cryogenic metrology system for ISIM based on photogrammetry. Photogrammetry is the measurement of the location of custom targets via triangulation using images obtained at a suite of digital camera locations and orientations. We describe metrology system requirements, plans, and ambient photogrammetric measurements of a mock-up of the ISIM structure to design targeting and obtain resolution estimates. We compare these measurements with those taken from a well known ambient metrology system, namely, the Leica laser tracker system. We also describe the data reduction algorithm planned to interpret cryogenic data from the Flight structure. Photogrammetry was selected from an informal trade study of cryogenic metrology systems because its resolution meets <b>sub-allocations</b> to ISIM alignment requirements and it is a non-contact method that can in principle measure six degrees of freedom changes in target location. In addition, photogrammetry targets can be readily related to targets used for ambient surveys of the structure. By thermally isolating the photogrammetry camera during testing, metrology can be performed in situ during thermal cycling. Photogrammetry also has a small but significant cryogenic heritage in astronomical instrumentation metrology. It was used to validate the displacement/deformation predictions of the reflectors and the feed horns during thermal/vacuum testing (90 K) for the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP). It also was used during thermal vacuum testing (100 K) to verify shape and component alignment at operational temperature of the High Gain Antenna for New Horizons. With tighter alignment requirements and lower operating temperatures than the aforementioned observatories, ISIM presents new challenges in the development of this metrology system...|$|R
