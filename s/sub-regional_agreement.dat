40|$|This article {{traces the}} {{emergence}} of an international law of disaster relief from a patchwork of norms through to a holistic body of international law. It argues that, for many years, the international law of disaster relief existed in piecemeal fashion. As there is no overarching treaty on the subject at the global level, a hodgepodge of instruments have been concluded, namely subject-specific and disaster-specific treaties at the global level, regional and <b>sub-regional</b> <b>agreements,</b> bilateral agreements, as well as soft law. Since the 2000 s, however, through the work of the International Law Commission and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, a holistic body of international law relating to disaster relief {{is in the process of}} emerging. The Article argues that this holistic body is in the process of emerging primarily as a result of three techniques which, while unconventional, are used relatively frequently in the making of international law. The three techniques are: (1) extrapolation from a series of piecemeal instruments to form a generalized standard; (2) the use of analogy; and (3) the conclusion of instruments that are soft in form but contain a mixture of hard law and soft law. The way in which the techniques have been used to develop a body of international law relating to disaster relief is analysed, their use in other fields of international law discussed, and limitations on their use in the disaster law context identified...|$|R
40|$|The CIS {{trade regime}} can be characterised as a mix of, partly overlapping, weak, bilateral, subregional, and {{multilateral}} agreements. This {{is a result}} of the design of the CIS, which was explicitly constructed to allow its member states to participate in only those parts that they deemed in their best interest and not to participate in other parts. The dissolution of the Soviet Union forced the successor states to create a trade regime. Initially, they turned to one another not to disrupt trade any more than needed. However, Russia carried most of the financial burden of the initial arrangements and started to push for bilateral agreements. The others followed this example, but were careful not to commit too much sovereignty in these agreements. At a later stage, <b>sub-regional</b> <b>agreements</b> substituted for the CIS framework as well. The CIS states remained ambivalent, however, to submit too much sovereignty, whereas Russia formally stayed out of the multilateral free trade agreements altogether. The countries did work together multilaterally and committed themselves to these agreements where it concerned specific issues. In this paper, we look for causes of the myriad of agreements in the actual economic developments. We will therefore present and discuss the major trade agreements with economic arguments. We will also briefly discuss the developments in the volume and direction of trade. Although we expect the gradual improvement of the agreements and the ‘rationalisation’ of the complex arrangement, we do not foresee a consolidated ‘hard’ multilateral framework in the short or even medium term. ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyThe slow {{advancement}} of the multilateral trading system {{has led to a}} wave of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) in Latin America and the Caribbean resulting in a web of bilateral and plurilateral PTAs, with countries both within and outside the region. More than 40 trade agreements now exist in the hemisphere, in addition to other arrangements that are now being negotiated or that will be negotiated before 2006. These agreements and their negotiation processes have generated centripetal and centrifugal forces that tend to unify and divide the regional integration process. While these agreements emerge as an opportunity for signatory countries, they also generate concerns in relation to such aspects as their consistency with multilateral commitments and the broadening and deepening of trade rules and disciplines beyond those being assumed in WTO. The disciplines contemplated in the areas of interest to industrialized countries tend to be WTO-plus, while the issues that affect Latin American and Caribbean signatories are often remitted to the multilateral negotiating forum. Hence, the multilateral level of negotiations cannot be simply replaced by a mix of bilateral and plurilateral negotiations. There is a call for a strong, complementary, mutually reinforcing process among the three (lateral, regional and multilateral) routes to liberalization and regulation. Bilateral agreements between countries or sub-regions could serve as building blocks when and if the precedents they establish are consistent with a comprehensive, balanced WTO that takes due account of the smaller economies' vulnerabilities. This is also true in cases where the commitments made in certain disciplines included in bilateral and <b>sub-regional</b> <b>agreements</b> facilitate the adoption of multilateral rules in the same disciplines. Otherwise, bilateral agreements could impede the construction of a development-oriented WTO, leaving the region with too extensive a web of hub-and-spoke agreements, with high associated costs of administration, transparency and efficiency...|$|R

3000|$|In principle, the TPP {{promises}} {{as one of}} {{its primary}} attributes to coexist with other regional and <b>sub-regional</b> trade <b>agreements</b> including NAFTA.

It seems obvious that it would multiply the number of rules and standards, thus rendering transactions more complicated, and would erode privileges gained under other agreements. In fact, this is what the Mexican government holds as its main motivation for joining the negotiations and signing the TPP. Given the difficulty in breathing new life into NAFTA, Mexican business and government officials have explicitly maintained that the TPP would serve to consolidate its major export market and the North American production network, built since the Agreement came into effect in 1994 (de Rosenzweig Mendialdua 2015). 19 [...]...|$|R

40|$|The railway {{industry}} in ASEAN {{is still struggling}} {{to make sure that}} it is still relevant and needed in ASEAN logistics industry. The upcoming ASEAN Economic Community eventually challenged the {{railway industry}} to develop itself to ensure that it could compete with the other mode of transportation in the cross border carriage of goods. The Singapore-Kunming Railway Link has given the railway industry another opportunity to improve the services and become one of the forces, which moved the sub-region economy. Accordingly, the physical and institutional developments need to be done simultaneously in ensuring the success of the cross border carriage of goods by rail. Practically, in ASEAN, since the railway industry is still as of personal interest, the developments phase is different according to the countries. The collective developments have yet to take place for both physical and institutional developments. Nevertheless, as for the time being, the cross border carriage of goods by rail in ASEAN mainland is still governed by the local law as there are lack of <b>sub-regional</b> level <b>agreements</b> to be used collectively. Protocol 6 of ASEAN Framework Agreement of Facilitation of Goods in Transit is the only <b>sub-regional</b> level <b>agreement</b> available to govern the railway industry collectively. But, it only concerns on the railway border and interchange station. The lack of coverage of other important aspect, especially the liability part, might decrease the confident and eagerness level of the members to move on with the idea of seamless cross border carriage of goods by rail. The research will look into the practices of cross border carriage of goods by rail in ASEAN mainland collectively from the operational and legal perspectives. The data from the operational perspective will provide the much-needed understanding on the carriage of goods by rail industry in ASEAN. By having the understanding on the practices, the points of similarities discovered will be used as the benchmark for the understanding of the industry. Also, the research will look into the legal aspects of the industry including the legal procedures and practices. The information from these two perspectives will provide the guideline as to the direction of the liability framework for cross border carriage of goods by rail in ASEAN mainland in ensuring the suitability of the said approach towards the industry and the upcoming free market future as it is intended to be use collectively...|$|R

The FTAAP initiative represents a politically ambitious, high potential benefit option for achieving Asian regional integration.

40|$|Today, {{more than}} a decade after the First Summit of the Americas which {{launched}} the FTAA (Free Trade Area of the Americas) process in 1994, increasing trade among countries of the Hemisphere remains a top priority. For Latin America and the Caribbean, trade agreements, particularly with larger developed countries, create opportunities to expand markets, attract investment, and stimulate job creation. In the mid- 1980 s and early 1990 s, these countries embraced reforms aimed at dismantling protectionist measures in their own markets and at promoting a more open and dynamic pattern of integration into the world economy. They began to liberalize their trade and investment regimes, and negotiated numerous trade agreements, some of which go beyond the elimination of tariffs and non-tariff barriers, whereas others are limited to trade in goods. They also entered into deeper forms of integration at the sub-regional level, which explains why the hemispheric trade regime is made up of a number of overlapping bilateral and <b>sub-regional</b> trade <b>agreements.</b> In contrast with the optimism of the early 1990 s characterized by the return to democracy in the region and the implementation of economic and political reforms, and despite the great strides and progress achieved, {{the first decade of the}} new millennium brought new anxieties an...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{analyses}} past trade {{trends and}} agricultural protectionism in Latin American agriculture, by examining observed changes in Latin American agriculture and trade policies {{over the last}} 20 years {{that have led to}} what the authors call the«New Open Regionalism».

The authors show that the repeated failure of the Doha round of trade talks opens the door for bilateral or <b>sub-regional</b> free trade <b>agreements,</b> concluding with the prediction that regional integration in Latin America will come about as a result of <b>agreements</b> between various <b>sub-regional</b> trade blocs. The weakness of internal demand makes the development of the region’s agri-food sector highly dependent on exports, the growth of which is one of the main economic drivers in these countries, particularly net exporters.

40|$|This {{paper on}} Trade Agreements within SSA, is an {{assessment}} of the ex post bilateral trade effect of the European Union-African Caribbean Pacific Preferential Trade Agreement (EU-ACP PTA) and <b>sub-regional</b> regional trade <b>agreements</b> (RTAs) on bilateral trade involving SSA countries. The main objective is to find out if EU trade preferences and regional trade agreements within SSA had increased trade flows. Estimating a gravity model augmented with measures of trade agreements, the paper made use of bilateral trade flows and key gravity covariates from CEPII database on 73 countries (48 SSA and 25 EU countries) over the period 1960 - 2006. After controlling for the endogeneity of the trade agreement dummy, accounting for multilateral price resistance and zero-valued trade flows, the findings indicate that the EU-ACP PTA and RTAs within ECOWAS and SADC have a positive and significant impact on bilateral trade involving SSA countries. In some cases the relative impact of the sub-regional RTAs was found to be stronger than the EU-ACP non-reciprocal PTA. The results therefore indicate the need for developing countries especially within SSA to focus on expanding and integrating regional markets in order to significantly improve trade performance...|$|R

The failure to complete the Agreement raises significant questions about the raison d’etre of regional agreements, the relationship between globalisation and regionalism, and the balance between free trade and social interests. The debate surrounding the FTAA presents a particularly interesting illustration of the arguments for and against free trade agreements generally [...] first, for their historic place in the global pattern and context of regionalisation within the Americas; second, for the issues raised by the current impasse. This paper explores the inherent flaws in the FTAA and how it might have potentially negative impacts on the region in terms of social, economic, environmental and political outcomes. The first part of this paper looks at the global and regional context of the FTAA and the growth of regionalism, mediated by the US and the EU. The second part looks at how regionalism and free trade, working through the FTAA, are seen to have serious drawbacks, which have generated a range of opposition, and led to the frustration of negotiations. This paper also questions whether, given the experience of NAFTA (North American Free Trade Area), the model itself is flawed; and whether the FTAA, in its far wider scope and significance for the Americas, will in effect fuel a ‘race to the bottom’. The final question is whether the situation can be retrieved, and whether changes to the FTAA, enabling it to promote economic, social and human development, will in fact be put in place...|$|R
40|$|In 1995, the European Union (EU) Member States and 12 Mediterranean {{countries}} {{launched in}} Barcelona a liberalization process that aims at establishing {{a free trade}} area (to be realized by 2010) and at promoting a sustainable and balanced economic development by {{the adoption of a}} new generation of Agreements: the Euro-Mediterranean Agreements (EMA). For the Mediterranean partner countries, the main concern is a better access for their fruit and vegetable exports to the European market. These products represent the main exports of these countries, and the EU is their first trading partner. On the other side, for the EU the main issue is not only the promotion of its products, but also the protection of its fruit and vegetables producers. Moreover, the trade with third countries is the key element of the Common Market Organization of the sector. Fruit and vegetables represent a very sensitive sector since their high seasonality, high perishability, and especially since the production of the Mediterranean countries is often similar to the European Mediterranean’s countries one. In fact, the agreements define preferences at the entrance of the EU market providing limited concessions for each partner, for specific products, limited quantities and calendars. This research tries to analyze the bilateral trade volume for fresh fruit and vegetables in the European and Italian markets in order to assess the effects of Mediterranean liberalization on this sector. Free trade of agricultural products represents a very actual topic in international trade and the Mediterranean countries, recognised as big producers of fruit and vegetables, as big exporters of their crops and actually significantly present on the European market, could be high competitors with the inward production because the outlet could be the same. The goal of this study is to provide some considerations about the competitiveness of mediterranean fruit and vegetables productions after Barcelona Process, in a first step for the European market and then also for the Italian one. The aim is to discuss the influence of the euro-mediterranean agreements on the fruit and vegetables trade between 10 foreign Mediterranean countries (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Libya, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, Syria, and Turkey) and 15 EU countries in the period 1995 - 2007, by means of a gravity model, which is a widespread methodology in international trade analysis. The basic idea of gravity models is that bilateral trade from one country to another (as the dependent variable) can be explained by a set of factors: -	factors that capture the potential of a country to export goods and services; -	factors that capture the propensity of a country to imports goods and services; -	any other forces that either attract or inhibit bilateral trade. This analysis compares only imports’ flows by Europe and by Italy (in volumes) from Mediterranean countries, since the exports’ flows toward those foreign countries are not significant, especially for Italy. The market of fruit and vegetables appears as a high heterogeneous group so it is very difficult to show a synthesis of the analysis performed and the related results. In fact, this sector includes the so called “poor products” (such as potatoes and legumes), and the “rich product”, such as nuts or exotic fruit, and there are a lot of different goods that arouse a dissimilar consumer demand which directly influence the import requirements. Fruit and vegetables sector includes products with extremely different biological cycles, leading to a very unlike seasonality. Moreover, the Mediterranean area appears as a highly heterogeneous bloc, including countries which differ from the others for economic size, production potential, capability to export and for the relationships with the EU. The econometric estimation includes 68 analyses, 34 of which considering the European import and 34 the Italian import and the products are examined in their aggregated form and in their disaggregated level. The analysis obtains a very high R 2 coefficient, which means that the methodology is able to assess the import effects on fruit and vegetables associated to the Association Agreements, preferential tariffs, regional integration, and others information involved in the equation. The empirical analysis suggests that fruits and vegetables trade flows are well explained by some parameters: size of the involved countries (especially GDP and population of the Mediterranean countries); distances; prices of imported products; local production for the aggregated products; preferential expressed tariffs like duty free; <b>sub-regional</b> <b>agreements</b> that enforce the export capability. The euro-mediterranean agreements are significant in some of the performed analysis, confirming the slow and gradual evolution of euro- Mediterranean liberalization. The euro-mediterranean liberalization provides opportunities from one side, and imposes a new important challenge from the other side. For the EU the chance is that fruit and vegetables imported from the mediterranean area represent a support for local supply and a possibility to increase the range of products existing on the market. The challenge regards the competition of foreign products with the local ones since the types of productions are similar and markets coincide, especially in the Italian issue. We need to apply a strategy based not on a trade antagonism, but on the realization of a common plane market with the Mediterranean countries. This goal could be achieved enhancing the industrial cooperation in addition to commercial relationships, and increasing investments’ flows in the Mediterranean countries aiming at transforming those countries from potential competitors to trade partners and creating new commercial policies to export towards extra European countries. ...|$|R
