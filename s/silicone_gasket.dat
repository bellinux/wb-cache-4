The lower crankcase assembly supported the crankshaft without conventional main bearing caps. An oil manifold plate with an integrated <b>silicone</b> <b>gasket</b> forms the oil gallery under this. A typical oil change used 7.5-8 quarts of oil.|$|E
50|$|Cast iron exhaust manifolds, less {{restrictive}} than units found on previous engines, were {{bolted to the}} outboard side of each head. The new cylinder heads also featured stud-mounted rocker arms, a change from the shaft-mounted LA arms. This last change {{was due to the}} different oiling system of the new engine, as described in the next paragraph. The valve covers on the Magnum have 10 bolts rather than the previous 5, for improved oil sealing. In addition, the valve covers were made of thicker steel than earlier parts, and were installed with a <b>silicone</b> <b>gasket.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Half Twist bottle was {{introduced}} in 2010 {{in an effort to}} expand the scope of Product Architects’ hydration options beyond the sports bottle market. [...] The primary feature of the bottle is the Half Twist cap, which is fitted with a <b>silicone</b> <b>gasket.</b> The lid allows the user to drink directly from the cap without removing it from the bottle and the gasket creates a watertight seal when closed. The Half Twist received positive reviews, though some users found the lid difficult to operate. The lid comes on two types of bottles: a 24-ounce (710 ml) High-density polyethylene bottle and a 28-ounce (828 ml) Stainless steel bottle. Both bottle types are BPA- and Phthalate-free.|$|E

30|$|Cassettes (Figure  4) are {{designed}} to contain all disposable components and fluid paths, eliminating the need to clean or customize the apparatus between syntheses. These molded polyurethane cassettes contain stainless steel needles (Vita Needle, Needham, MA, USA), tubing, chemically inert three-way stopcock valves (EW- 31200 - 80, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA), and a custom polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-coated <b>silicone</b> <b>gasket</b> (Specialty Silicone Products, Inc., Ballston Spa, NY, USA, and Cannon Gasket, Upland, CA, USA) against which the reaction vessel is sealed. The fluid paths are shown in Figure  5. Preassembled cassettes slide along rails into the ELIXYS system which are then locked down by clamps. Accurate positioning is ensured by the mating of alignment features and by the engagement of stopcock valves with adapters affixed to rotary pneumatic actuators (CRB 2 BW 20 - 180 S, SMC Corporation).|$|E
30|$|For pressure-flow experiments, upon harvest, pots were washed {{three times}} (3 ± 50 mL) to {{saturation}} with {{water for the}} control treatment and HgCl 2 solution (500 μM) for the inhibited treatment. Saturation of the pots allowed us to determine root conductivity since under non-limiting soil moisture, plant resistance exceeds soil resistance (in wet soil, the bulk soil potential is close to 0 MPa, Ruggiero et al. [1999]; [2003]). Following this washing, the above-ground part was cut off with a razor blade just below the cotyledonary leaves (40 – 50 mm from the base). Pots with whole root systems were placed in a stainless steel pressure chamber (Soil Moisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA, Maggio and Joly [1995]). Excised stems were sealed into {{the lid of the}} chamber through a <b>silicone</b> <b>gasket</b> so that part of the stem protruded and chamber pressure was gradually increased. Water expressed from each cut stem was collected using an Eppendorf tube containing dry cotton wool. The amount of sap was determined by weighing the tube before and after collection. The sap flow (Jv), expressed as the quantity of water exuded from the cut stems, was monitored every 5 min for at least 45 min after it had reached a constant rate (reached in less than 25 min). Aliquots of expressed sap were collected from each root system for later analysis of K+ content.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to develop an {{experimental}} platform to carry out controlled DNA denaturation reactions while monitoring the fractional hybridization using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides. Because shorter oligonucleotides denature at a lower temperature, {{it is possible to}} decode the sequence based on their melting temperatures. This technique, known as Sequencing by Denaturation, is based on the sequential denaturation of DNA fragments generated by a Sanger dideoxy sequencing reaction on surface-bound DNA templates. To perform these experiments, a device was constructed consisting of nine microfluidic channels formed by an adhesive <b>silicone</b> <b>gasket</b> sandwiched between a coverslip and a stainless steel plate that is encased in an aluminum block. Cooling and heating capabilities are provided by thermoelectric modules, which are in contact with another aluminum block that serves as the heatsink and microscope stage insert. The device satisfies the major criteria for performing this sequencing method. The microfluidic channels are uniformly heated to ensure that all the molecules experience the same temperature. Additionally, the device undergoes a consistent thermal expansion throughout the temperature ramp, allowing the imaging plane to be tracked by the microscope. We demonstrated the ability to determine the components of a denaturation profile created by the combination of four different oligonucleotide lengths. Based on simulation data, we also determined that {{it might be possible to}} resolve a denaturation curve using as few as fifty probes. Due to the speed, simplicity, and low cost of sequencing with SBD, it has potential to enable large-scale genome re-sequencing and genotypin...|$|E

Zoggs also launched Air Cushion Technology into their frames, which is claimed to give an almost not there feeling to their goggles, with <b>silicone</b> <b>gaskets</b> containing air pockets for a customised fit and no more marking around the eyes from wearing goggles.

25|$|The NGA {{hired the}} {{structural}} engineering firm Robert Silman Associates {{to determine the}} cause of the problem. Although the Gallery began raising private funds to fix the issue, eventually federal funding was used to repair the building. In 2012, the NGA chose a joint venture, Balfour Beatty/Smoot, to complete the repairs. Anodized aluminum anchors replaced the stainless steel ones, and the top corner anchors were moved {{to the center of the}} top edge of each stone. The neoprene joints were removed and new colored <b>silicone</b> <b>gaskets</b> installed, and leveling screws rather than mortar used to keep the panels square. Work began in November 2011, and originally was scheduled to end in 2014. By February 2012, however, the contractor said work on the façade would end in late 2013, and site restoration would take place in 2014. The East Building remained open throughout the project.|$|R

40|$|The report {{presents}} analyzed surface {{areas on}} particular experiment trays from the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) for silicone-based molecular contamination. The trays for examination {{were part of}} the Ultra-Heavy Cosmic Ray Experiment (UHCRE). These particular trays were chosen because each tray was identical to the others in construction, and the materials on each tray were well known, documented, and characterized. In particular, a known specific source of silicone contamination was present on each tray. Only the exposure conditions varied from tray to tray. The results of post-flight analyses of surfaces of three trays were compared with the predictions of the three different spacecraft molecular contamination models. Phase one tasks included: 1) documenting the detailed geometry of the hardware; 2) determining essential properties of the anodized aluminum, Velcro(Tm), silverized Teflon(Tm), <b>silicone</b> <b>gaskets,</b> and DC 6 - 1104 (Tm) silicone adhesive materials used to make the trays, tray covers, and thermal control blankets; 3) selecting and removing areas from each tray; and 4) beginning surface analysis of the selected tray walls. Phase two tasks included: 1) completion of surface analysis measurements of the selected tray surface, 2) obtaining auger depth profiles at selected locations, and 3) running versions of the ISEM, MOFLUX, and PLIMP (Plume Impingement) contamination prediction models and making comparisons with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Healthy, mature, spontaneously {{contracting}} muscle was cultivated from explants of 13 -day chick embryos {{for periods}} up to 4 {{months in the}} multipurpose chamber (Rose, 1954) using cellophane-strip technique (Rose et al., 1958) with <b>silicone</b> <b>gaskets,</b> Eagle's medium including 10 per cent horse serum reinforced with 300 mg-per cent of glucose, and the teased type of explant. This method provided optically ideal conditions {{for the study of}} muscle fibers with oil immersion, phase contrast time-lapse cinematography at 1 frame per minute without apparent damage for periods as long as 10 days. In no case was mitosis, amitosis, or nuclear "budding" observed in the course of muscle development. Multinuclear muscle fibers have been shown with cine technique to result from both myoblast fusion and polar extension of preformed (explanted) muscle tissue. Myoblast fusion was the only demonstrable way of giving rise to multinucleation. Nuclear membrane "wrinkling" was shown to be merely a temporary distortion that occurred during nuclear migration and rotation. It is suggested that this phenomenon may be responsible for numerous reports of amitosis in the genesis of muscle fibers. The histological development of new straps resulted from an orderly sequence of events. Included in these were polar extension, nuclear migration, rotation, and fixation. Following these events there was increased mitochondrial activity, myofibril formation, and cross-banding. Spontaneous contractions were seen throughout the entire course of differentiation in vitro but became more regular and stronger in the later stages...|$|R

Fuel cells can be considered as an impending technology to substitute for internal combustion (IC) engines in transportation. In particular, the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) is exceptionally suitable for the automobile sector owing to its broad power range at relatively low temperatures plus the ability to perform under discontinuous operation. However, to gain this advantage, durability of the PEMFC should be verified by achieving a minimum of 5000 hours of operating life. Particularly, durability of the stacks plays {{a crucial role in the}} process of commercialization because of the intricacies involved in its design and operation under itinerant environments. This study is an evaluation of degradation and failure mechanisms of a 10 -cell 100 Watt PEMFC stack subjected to load cycles analogous to load cycles in an automotive vehicle. The durability test protocol was developed by DOE representative of transportation applications. The analysis and characterization was carried out for the stack as wells as for the individual cells using in-test and post-test diagnostic techniques including current interrupt, polarization measurements, cyclic voltammetry, post-mortem electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. A 3 % loss in stack voltage was observed from the maximum achieved performance over 480 hours of load cycling. The stack failed to perform after 480 hours of testing due to complete failure of one cell unrelated to catalyst loss and membrane damage. Post mortem analysis indicated that the major cause of failure was due to loss of both anode and cathode <b>silicone</b> <b>gaskets</b> that led to direct reaction of hydrogen and oxygen as well as short-circuiting the stack. It was also revealed that the bulk of the performance degradation was because of gradual decrease in kinetics of the cathode reaction with concomitant loss of electrochemically active surface area of the platinum nanoparticles...|$|R

By making some reasonable initial assumptions, simplified constant temperature and dose rates were derived that should do a reasonable job of simulating the complex environments for worst-case severe events that combine overall aging plus accidents. Further simplification coupled with thermal-only experiments allowed us to derive thermal-only conditions {{that can be used}} to achieve CSR and CS responses similar to those expected from the combined environments that are more difficult to simulate. Although the thermal-only simulations should lead to sealing forces similar to those expected during a severe accident, modulus and density results indicate that significant differences in underlying chemistry are expected for the thermal-only and the combined environment simulations. 15 refs., 31 figs., 15 tabs...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stacks require sealing {{around the perimeter of}} the cells to prevent the gases inside the cell from leaking. Elastomeric materials are commonly used for this purpose. The overall performance and durability of the fuel cell is heavily dependent on the long-term stability of the gasket. In this study, the degradation of three elastomeric <b>gasket</b> materials (<b>silicone</b> rubber, commercial EPDM and a developed EPDM 2 compound) in an accelerated ageing environment was investigated. The change in properties and structure of a <b>silicone</b> rubber <b>gasket</b> caused by use in a real fuel cell was studied and compared to the changes in the same <b>silicone</b> rubber <b>gasket</b> material brought about by accelerated aging. The accelerated aging conditions were chosen to relate to the PEM fuel cell environment, but with more extreme conditions of elevated temperature (140 °C) and greater acidity. Three accelerated ageing media were used. The first one was dilute sulphuric acid solution with the pH values of 1, 2 and 4. Secondly, Nafion ® membrane suspended in water was used for accelerated ageing at a pH 3 to 4. Finally, diluted trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) solution of pH 3. 3 was chosen. Weight change and the tensile properties of the aged gasket samples were measured. In addition, compression set behaviour of the elastomeric seal materials was investigated in order to evaluate their potential sealing performance in PEM fuel cells. The results showed that acid hydrolysis was the most likely mechanism of silicone rubber degradation and that similar degradation occurred under both real fuel cell and accelerated aging conditions. The effect of TFA solution on silicone rubber was more aggressive than sulphuric acid and Nafion® solutions with the same acidity (pH value) suggesting that TFA accelerated the acid hydrolysis of silicone rubber. In addition, acid ageing in all three acidic solutions caused visible surface damage and a significant decrease in tensile strength of the silicone rubber material, but did not significantly affect the EPDM materials. EPDM 2 compound had a desirable (low) compression set value which was similar to silicone rubber and much better than the commercial EPDM. It also showed a very good performance in the fuel cell test rig conforming that it a potential replacement for silicone rubber in PEMFCs...|$|R
40|$|Most {{quantitative}} analytical {{measurement techniques}} require calibration to correlate signal with {{the quantity of}} analyte. The {{purpose of this study}} was to employ exhaustive coulometry, an implementation of coulometric analysis in a stopped-flow, fixed-volume, thin-layer cell, to attain calibration-free measurements that would directly benefit intervention-free analysis systems designed for remote deployment. This technique capitalizes on the short diffusion lengths (3 ̆c 100 µm) to dramatically reduce the time for analysis (3 ̆c 30 sec). For this work, a thin-layer fluidic cell was designed in software, fabricated via CNC machining, and evaluated using Ferri/Ferrocyanide Fe(CN) 63 -/ 4 - as a model analyte. The 2 µL fixed volume incorporated an oval, 8 mm by 4 mm, thin-film gold electrode sensor with an integrated Ag|AgCl pseudo-reference electrode. The flow cell area matched the shape of the sensor, with a volume set by the thickness of a laser-cut <b>silicone</b> rubber <b>gasket</b> (80 µm). A semi-permeable membrane isolated the working electrode and counter electrode chambers to prevent analyte diffusion. A miniaturized custom potentiostat was designed and built to measure reaction currents ranging from 10 mA to 0. 1 nA. Software was developed to perform step voltammetry as well as cyclic voltammetry analysis for verifying electrode condition and optimal redox potential levels. Experimentally determined oxidation/reduction potentials of - 100 mV and 400 mV, respectively, were applied to the working electrode for sample concentrations ranging from 50 µM to 10, 000 µM. The current generated during the reactions was recorded and the total charge captured at each concentration was obtained by integrating the amperograms. When compared to the expected charge for a 2 µL sample, the total charge vs. concentration plots displayed a near perfect linearity over the full concentration range, and the expected charge (100...|$|R

The NanoSpace- 1 nanospacecraft is a full-fledged satellite design with mass below 10 kg. The high performance with respect to mass is enabled by a massive implementation of microsystem technology – the entire spacecraft structure is built from square silicon panels that allow for efficient microsystem integration. The panels comprise bonded silicon wafers, fitted with <b>silicone</b> rubber <b>gaskets</b> into aluminium frames. Each module of the spacecraft is added {{in a way that}} strengthens and stiffens the overall spacecraft structure. The structural integrity of the silicon module as a generic building block has been successfully proven. The basic design (silicon, silicone, aluminium) survived considerable mechanical loads, where the silicon material contributed significantly to the strength of the structural element. Structural modeling of the silicon building blocks enables rapid iterative design of e. g. spacecraft structures by the use of pertinent model simplifications. Other microsystem interfaces treats fluidic, thermal, and mechanical functions. First, solder sealing of microsystem cavities was demonstrated, using screen-printed solder and localized resistive heating in the microsystem interface. Second, a dismountable fluidic microsystem connector, using a ridged silicon membrane, intended for monopropellant thruster systems, was developed. Third, a thermally regulated microvalve for minute flows, made by a silicon ridge imprint in a stainless steel nipple, was investigated. Finally, particle filters for gas interfaces to microsystems, or between parts of fluidic microsystems, were made from sets of crossed v-grooves in the interface of a bonded silicon wafer stack. Filter manufacture, mass flow and pressure drop characterization, together with numeric modeling for filter design, was performed.

40|$|In this work, a {{detailed}} combined numerical-experimental {{program has been}} developed to study the shore hardness testing of rubber materials principally used for gasket applications. The correlation between shore hardness and linear elastic and hyperelastic properties has been systematically investigated. A detailed FE model of the shore A hardness test has been developed with re-meshing functions in order {{to cope with the}} large deformation during simulation of shore hardness tests over a range of E values. The model is used in modelling shore A hardness on samples with standard thickness (over 6 mm) and the result is validated against published experimental data. FE indentation models of thin samples are then developed and successfully used to predict the shore hardness of thinner samples over a property range relevant to gasket applications. A chart linking shore hardness, Young’s modulus and samples thickness is established and used to analyse shore hardness of three cases including silicone rubber made in the lab with different thicknesses, thin <b>silicone</b> rubber <b>gasket</b> and an EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) gasket for plate heat exchangers. In all of the cases, the estimated E values based on shore hardness tests are able to predict the deformation of the material under different loading conditions including tensile and compression tests on samples of different shapes. In shore OO hardness modelling, the numerical results show a good agreement with analytical solution for spherical indenters. The shore hardness, thickness and E value chart predicted is used to evaluate the properties (Young’s modulus) of a soft silicone rubber and a latex rubber, in both cases, the E values predicted from hardness tests are able to predict the deformation of the material under tension and compression. In the case of latex rubber, the results also agree with hyperelastic properties from combined tensile and planar tests. Based on the FE model developed, extensive data over a larger spectrum of material properties are developed and used in developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) program for inverse estimation of material properties from shore hardness and direct prediction of shore hardness for the cases when the material properties are known. The results show that the E values can be predicted from shore hardness tests with accuracy within 10...|$|R
