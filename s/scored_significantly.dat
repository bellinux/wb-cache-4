25|$|Vermont {{was named}} the nation's smartest state in 2005 and 2006. In 2006 there was a gap between state testing {{standards}} and national, which is biased {{in favor of the}} state standards by 30%, on average. This puts Vermont 11th-best in the nation. Most states have a higher bias. However, when allowance for race is considered, a 2007 US Government list of test scores shows Vermont white fourth graders performed 25th in the nation for reading (229), 26th for math (247). White eighth graders scored 18th for math (292) and 12th for reading (273). The first three scores were not considered statistically different from average. White eighth graders <b>scored</b> <b>significantly</b> above average in reading. Statistics for black students were not reliable because of their small representation in the testing.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{jumping on the}} hind legs can include {{injuries}} to the proximal, medial, or lateral branches of the suspensory ligaments. Jumping horses can also be at {{a higher risk of}} developing osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) or other arthritic conditions, even at a young age. Genetic and environmental components play roles in the development of OCD in horses: some families have weaker joints, but excessive growth over a short period of time, age-inappropriate exercise regimens and nutrition can also contribute. Jumping performance is especially influenced by the presence of arthropathic hocks. One study found that at breeding stock evaluations, horses with radiographically diagnosed athropathies of the hock joints <b>scored</b> <b>significantly</b> lower than their healthy peers for the quality of the canter, jumping technique, and ability and their character. The pain associated with arthropathic conditions likely makes the horses unwilling to push powerfully off their hindlegs, a quality necessary for jumping and cantering and which could make the horse appear lazy or unwilling to work.|$|E

The research {{was reported in the}} March and July 2013 issues of the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education and in the December 2013 issue of the International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education. The three studies examined student achievement in schools in 5 geographically dispersed states.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to evaluate the changes in oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) during implant treatment for partially edentulous patients, and to evaluate {{the influence of the}} type of partially edentulous arch. MethodsTwenty patients with a small number of lost teeth (fewer than 4 teeth) who underwent implant treatment were selected. Chronological QOL change during implant treatment was measured. The subjects completed the shortened Japanese version of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-J 14) before the surgery (T 0), 1 week after the surgery (T 1), 1 week after interim prosthesis placement (T 2), and 1 week after definitive prosthesis placement (T 3). Complete data of the twenty subjects were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. ResultsThe total OHIP-J 14 <b>score</b> was <b>significantly</b> reduced only at T 3 (P< 0. 05). “Physical pain” and “Physical disability” <b>scores</b> <b>significantly</b> decreased at T 3, and “Psychological discomfort” <b>scores</b> also <b>significantly</b> dropped at T 2. However, “Functional limitation” <b>scores</b> <b>significantly</b> increased at T 1. “Psychological disability”, “Social disability”, and “Handicap” scores remained the same. On the other hand, in the comparison {{depending on the type of}} partially edentulous arch, the total OHIP-J 14 <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> decreased at T 3 in the unilateral free-end edentulous space, whereas no significant difference was observed in the bounded edentulous space.

Increasing cognitive load may facilitate the detection of deception because it is more difficult to act deceptively under these conditions.|$|E
