30|$|One {{of them is}} an {{application}} of the aforementioned backpressure turbine or extraction-backpressure turbine fed with <b>outlet</b> <b>steam</b> from the high-pressure turbine from the cold reheat <b>steam</b> line. The <b>outlet</b> <b>steam</b> together with the driving turbine bleeds (if any) would condense in low-pressure regenerative exchangers. Owing {{to the fact that}} <b>outlet</b> <b>steam</b> also gives up heat in the regenerative system, the extraction-backpressure turbine does not require a costly system of the condenser and cooling water which usually is the case with the condensing turbine driving the main feed pump.|$|R
30|$|Yet, another {{solution}} {{is the use}} of a backpressure turbine working in parallel with the intermediate-pressure turbine. The driving turbine is fed with steam from a hot reheat <b>steam</b> line. <b>Outlet</b> <b>steam</b> from the turbine is in turn introduced into the inlet of the low-pressure turbine. Such a configuration limits the problem of too little steam fed to the low-pressure turbine at low loads of the unit. What can be a problem, however, are the high parameters of the inlet steam (identical to those at the inlet to the intermediate-pressure turbine), which is related to the use of expensive construction materials.|$|R

5000|$|A regular {{problem with}} early steam {{locomotives}} {{was that of}} priming, the carry-over of water with the steam.

Stephenson's Rocket of 1829 had used such a small steam dome. In the 1830s, domes became extravagantly large. A drawback to fitting such large domes was the weakening of the boiler shell where such a large hole was cut into it.|$|E

This work was completed in 1931.In 1941, two more Babcock + Wilcox High Head boilers rated at 90,000 pounds of steam per hour, operating at a pressure of 355 lb/sq in and 850degF, were brought into use. They had a balanced draught system and were fitted with chain grate stokers and their flue gasses were taken away by two new short steel stacks. This was followed in 1942 by the commissioning of a third BTH 20 MW turbo-alternator(No4).|$|E

50|$|One of {{the best-known}} designs is the Stone-Vapor. The inner casing of the boiler forms a {{vertical}} bell, with an outer airtight cylindrical casing. The oil or gas burner is mounted at the top, above the coils, and facing downwards. The heating element is a single tube, arranged {{into a number of}} helical cylinders. The first helices (in the flow direction) are small-diameter tubes, wrapped in large diameter turns. Succeeding turns are coiled inside this and the tube is of progressively increasing diameter, to allow for a constant flow rate as the water evaporates into steam and forms bubbles. The <b>steam</b> <b>outlet</b> is from the final turn {{at the bottom of the}} inner helix. The outlet is approximately 90% steam (by mass) and residual water is separated by passing it through a steam-water separator. The exhaust gases turn upwards and flow over the outside of the bell, usually passing additional helices that are used as an initial feedwater heater.|$|E

40|$|The {{exhaust gas}} in an {{internal}} combustion engine provides favorable conditions for a waste-heat recovery (WHR) system. The highest potential is achieved by the Rankine cycle as a heat recovery technology. There are only few experimental studies that investigate full-scale systems using water-based working fluids and their effects on the performance and operation of a Rankine cycle heat recovery system. This paper discusses experimental results and practical challenges with a WHR system when utilizing heat from the exhaust gas recirculation system of a truck engine. The {{results showed that the}} boiler’s pinch point necessitated trade-offs between maintaining adequate boiling pressure while achieving acceptable cooling of the EGR and superheating of the water. The expander used in the system had a geometric compression ratio of 21 together with a <b>steam</b> <b>outlet</b> timing that caused high re-compression. Inlet pressures of up to 30 bar were therefore required for a stable expander power output. Such high pressures increased the pump power, and reduced the EGR cooling in the boiler because of pinch-point effects. Simulations indicated that reducing the expander’s compression ratio from 21 to 13 would allow 30 % lower steam supply pressures without adversely affecting the expander’s power output...|$|E
40|$|Background: Steam {{generator}} (SG) {{is one of}} {{the significant}} components in the nuclear steam supply system. A variety of SGs have been designed and used in nuclear reactor systems. Every SG has advantages and disadvantages. A brief account of some of the existing SG designs is presented in this study. A high surface to volume ratio of a SG is required in small modular reactors to occupy the least space. In this paper, performance improvement for SGs of integral small modular reactor is proposed. Aims/Methods: For this purpose, cross-grooved microfins have been incorporated on the inner surface of the helical tube to enhance heat transfer. The primary objective of this work is to investigate thermal–hydraulic behavior of the proposed improvements through modeling in RELAP 5 - 3 D. Results and Conclusions: The results are compared with helical-coiled SGs being used in IRIS (International Reactor Innovative and Secure). The results show that the tube length reduces up to 11. 56 % keeping thermal and hydraulic conditions fixed. In the case of fixed size, the <b>steam</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature increases from 590. 1  K to 597. 0  K and the capability of power transfer from primary to secondary also increases.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{order to}} provide the {{capability}} of a thermal storage to produce superheated steam with a temperature of about 330 o C (pressure 70 bar), a new phase change material based on a Tin-Zinc alloy was explored as the heat storage medium. It was shown that 70 wt % Zn in the alloy would be optimal to attain a thermal storage temperature of 360 - 370 o C, using solar superheated steam 400 o C as the heat charging fluid. At the stage of heat discharge, high quality steam is produced {{on the base of}} utilizing mainly the phase change heat of zinc solidification and partly sensible heat of the liquid phase. A heat transfer fluid (e. g. DOWTHERM-A) is used to enhance heat transfer between the storage medium and built-in heat exchangers by the effect of reflux evaporation-condensation. Since the storage process is essentially non-isothermal, a secondary, relatively small thermal buffer following the main storage is required to stabilize the <b>steam</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature. The results of calculations for a pilot of 5 MWh thermal storage show that steam sent to a turbine after the buffer may have a temperature near 330 o C during the entire charge-discharge cycle comprised of 6 and 1 hr periods respectively.

40|$|While EER (Exhaust Energy Recovery) {{has been}} widely pursued for {{improving}} the total efficiency and reducing CO emissions of internal combustion engines, the improvement on engine efficiency has been investigated with experimental work and numerical simulation based on a steam Rankine cycle EER system. The test was conducted on a light-duty gasoline engine connected with a multi-coil helical heat exchanger. Combining those experimental and modelling results, it demonstrates that the flow rate of working fluid plays a very important and complex role for controlling the <b>steam</b> <b>outlet</b> pressure and overheat degree. For achieving required overheat and steam pressure, the flow rate must be carefully regulated if the engine working condition changes. The flow rate has also significant influence on the heat exchanger efficiency. To achieving better heat transfer efficiency, the flow rate should be maintained as high as possible. From the simulation, it is found the EER system based on the light-duty test engine could increase the engine fuel conversion efficiency up to 14 %, though under general vehicle operating conditions it was just between 3 % and 8 %. From the test, it is found the installation of heat exchanger can increase the exhaust back pressure slightly, the total fuel saving of the engine could be up to 34 % under some operating condition. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Even the change in the design specifications, with a resulting reduction in the wall thickness, leads to improved flexibility in the plant operation and an economic benefit, even without the use of different materials.
