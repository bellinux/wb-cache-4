5|$|The {{intention}} {{to create the}} racing modes of the game had been present {{from the start of}} the project and Battle Mode was developed from the desire to create a one-on-one mode where victory was not determined simply by competing for rank. The game did not start out as a Mario series game and the first prototype featured a generic man in overalls in the kart; the team decided that characters three heads tall would best suit the design of the karts. They did not decide on incorporating Mario series characters into the game until two or three months after the start of development. The choice was made after the development team, when observing how one kart looked to another driving past it, decided to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would look like with Mario in the kart. Thinking that having Mario in the kart looked better than previous designs, the idea of a Mario themed racing game was born.|$|E

His relationship with his mentor, Aristotle Rodor, is one of many things that keep him from going over the edge and back towards the darkness he had shown in his youth on the streets of Hub City.|$|E

In a list of the best web-based calendar software for small businesses, Forbes ranked 30 Boxes second, after Google Calendar.

A few months before (over the summer), his brother and sister had both died, so Morin had asked Air France if it was possible for him not to fly during the actual Christmas celebrations, but they had refused his request... so he went to work on the flight feeling very reluctant, because he had wanted to be with his parents and family.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, Canada was {{importing}} 90% of its {{oil from}} the U.S. The situation changed dramatically in 1947 when, after drilling 133 consecutive dry holes, Imperial Oil decided to drill into a peculiar anomaly on its newly developed seismic recordings near the then-village of Leduc to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was. The Leduc No. 1 well identified a large oil field, and provided the geological key for other important discoveries within Alberta. Geologists soon began to identify and drill other Devonian reefs within the province - mostly in the north-central portion of the province. The Alberta oil rush began, and drillers quickly began to identify other important oil-bearing formations like the one hosting the giant Pembina oilfield.|$|E
25|$|During filming, it was {{considered}} that the customized 1975 Captain Kirk mask be reused for this film. However, the mask was long gone and a new one was purchased from a local costume shop. The producers wanted to test and <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would look like without the edits. The school scene was filmed and when reviewing the producers did not like how the mask turned out. It was allegedly customized again but did {{not live up to}} the original, and the producers felt it was too old and went for a new mask. Some scenes had to be re-shot with the new mask. The only scene left in is when Loomis is thrown through a glass door; as Michael comes up behind him, the unaltered face and blonde hair is visible.|$|E

There was too much discipline and routine involved. I felt like it would be a challenge, to step forth and do it, to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was all about. It gave a sense of confidence.

500|$|The Doors {{wanted to}} {{capitalize}} on the experimental climate in popular music at the time that brought about groundbreaking works like The White Album and Electric Ladyland while redefining what could be accomplished within the rock medium. Looking for a new, creative sound, Rothchild hired Paul Harris to arrange string and orchestral arrangements for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and local jazz horn players. Session musicians Doug Lubahn and Harvey Brooks also served as additional bass guitarists. The music on The Soft Parade incorporated art rock, blues rock, jazz fusion, and psychedelic rock styles. Drummer John Densmore and Manzarek, who both had jazz backgrounds, asserted they were receptive to Rothchild's jazz concept: [...] "We'd [...] always talk about using some jazz musicians – let's put some horns and strings on, man, let's <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would be like to record with a string section and a big horn section", recalled Manzarek.|$|E
