5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode had a lot of potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E
25|$|In April, Radwańska {{began her}} clay {{season at the}} Porsche Tennis Grand Prix as the 7th seed. She lost in {{straight}} sets to Ekaterina Makarova in the first round. She later withdrew from her forthcoming tournaments in Madrid and Rome, citing a foot injury. At the French Open Radwańska was seeded at No.9. In her first match after being sidelined for five weeks due to a right foot injury she eased past Fiona Ferro in straight sets in just over an hour. In the second round she defeated Belgium’s Alison Van Uytvanck to face Alizé Cornet in the third round. Radwańska had won seven of their eight previous matches, including {{the only one on}} clay - at the French Open nine years ago - but this time lost to Cornet in two sets. Radwanska withdrew from the Ricoh Open and Aegon Classic Birmingham due to a viral illness. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 2017 Aegon International as the No. 9 seed but fell to Lauren Davis. Radwańska then started her Wimbledon Championships campaign where she defeated Jelena Janković, Christina McHale and Timea Bacsinszky before falling to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{connection}} to Blake's later mythology {{is found in}} The Vales of Har, which are mentioned in The Book of Thel (1789). It is in the Vales where lives Thel herself, and throughout the poem they are represented {{as a place of}} purity and innocence; [...] "I walk through the vales of Har. and smell the sweetest flowers" [...] (3:18). At the end of the poem, when Thel is shown the world of experience outside the Vales, she panics and flees back to the safety of her home; [...] "The Virgin started from her seat, & with a shriek./Fled back unhinderd till <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vales of Har" [...] (6:21-22).|$|E

6000|$|In {{the shadows}} that were round them, Alban {{could just see}} that she was shaking her {{clinched}} fists in the air. He made another attempt to control her. [...] "Don't excite yourself! If <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden, <b>she</b> might hear you." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the Iliad (4.514), the Homeric Hymns, and in Hesiod's Theogony, Athena is {{also given}} the curious epithet Tritogeneia (Τριτογένεια), whose {{significance}} remains unclear. It could mean various things, including [...] "Triton-born", perhaps {{indicating that the}} homonymous sea-deity was her parent according to some early myths. One myth relates the foster father relationship of this Triton towards the half-orphan Athena, whom he raised alongside his own daughter Pallas. Karl Kerényi suggests that [...] "Tritogeneia {{did not mean that}} <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> world on any particular river or lake, but that she was born of the water itself; for the name Triton seems to be associated with water generally." [...] In Ovid's Metamorphoses Athena is occasionally referred to as [...] "Tritonia".|$|E
2500|$|Bessie was a {{key partner}} in her husband's work, {{supporting}} him and his students and opening her home to the many people who sought her husband's counsel. They installed a telephone in their bedroom so callers could reach him at any hour. On Simchat Torah, when hundreds of singing and dancing students escorted Scheinberg home from the yeshiva after the services, she would look on from their sixth-floor apartment. When he came upstairs, {{he would say to}} her, [...] "Did you see that? Did you see all those students singing and dancing? That was all because of you. It's all yours, Basha". Similarly, when <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> yeshiva, he would give up his seat for her, saying, [...] "Basha, this seat belongs to you".|$|E
2500|$|When still a young woman, <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{possession}} of Lang Syne Plantation, formerly {{belonging to a}} great-aunt, Mrs. Lovell, a daughter of Colonel William Heatley. [...] "Lang Syne" [...] was located in St. Matthew's parish, on the Congaree River near Fort Motte, South Carolina, about [...] from Columbia. This she administered during her young womanhood {{with a high degree}} of skill, executive ability, and a careful attention to details. In May 1840, she married the lawyer, David James McCord (d. 1855), of Columbia, South Carolina. He was a gentleman of considerable local distinction as a lawyer, public speaker, writer/editor of the [...] "Statutes at large of South Carolina", and a frequent contributor to the Southern Quarterly Review. He was one of the best writers in the US on Free Trade. They lived happily for 15 years. McCord died in 1855.|$|E
6000|$|... "I admit it. But, tell me, have I not watched to some purpose. There is {{no mistaking}} the look in your face sometimes, when <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room unexpectedly. If the thing were not absurd, I should {{say that you were}} afraid of her." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "What Anna {{brings to}} the project is that <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> world of Fringe {{with all of its}} edge and mystery, and she brings this sort of elegance and poise to it that makes you just love her and want to make sure she's OK and gets through it."

50|$|The band {{returned}} in 2012 when they released Northern Shore through MapleMusic Recordings. In 2013, the band released No. 1 Northern, {{an album of}} cover versions of songs by Canadian songwriters, including Neil Young, Gordon Lightfoot, Ron Sexsmith, Gene MacLellan, Linda McRae, Charlie Angus and Andrew Cash. They also released <b>the</b> album <b>She</b> <b>Comes</b> <b>Into</b> <b>The</b> Room.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2013, she {{released}} [...] "Jikele" [...] as the album's third single. Motherland was {{revealed to be}} a 12-track album and when asked why is it taking so long? she commented [...] "One needs to take one's time because good work takes time. But it must be worth the wait in the end." [...] At the 4th City People Awards, 14 July 2013, she lost South South Musician of the Year to fellow Rivers State recording artist Oba Omega; present at the occasion were the celebrities Rita Dominic and Yvonne Nelson from Ghana. Muma Gee competed in the first Imo State intercommunity beauty pageant, representing the community of Umuhu in Ngor Okpala. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> competition through her matrimonial union with Eke, whose heritage stems from the Umuhu people. On 1 August 2013, she was named Mrs. Ngor Okpala by first lady of Imo State, Nneoma Nkechi Okorocha, after beating off challenges from 28 other entrants. It was also made known on 23 September 2013, that Muma Gee has commenced a new recording session—possibly for Motherland—with Slim Burna and P Jaydino in the studio. On 15 February 2014, whilst heavily pregnant with her first child, she confirmed {{in a telephone interview}} with Saturday Beats of The Punch that she will be performing at the album launch party for Motherland regardless of her physical condition. On 18 April, just weeks before the anticipated concert, Uwame delivered twins – {{a boy and a girl}} commenting on this Uwame said, [...] "I was not initially expecting twins. All I knew was that I started getting big and bigger. And people would see me and say, oh, you are looking so beautiful. I didn't believe I was going to have twins." ...|$|E

50|$|It {{turns out}} Wills {{has managed to}} get Mary arrested for trying to kidnap Stephanie, and the police bring her to the mansion. Eddie impersonates Francis again and make the police release Mary, and <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house to see her daughter. Meanwhile, Francis has been bound and gagged by Wills, who {{believes}} he is Eddie.|$|R
5000|$|An easy-going garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins), meets Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), a {{successful}} Princeton University mathematics doctoral candidate, as <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garage, accompanied by her resistant and critical English fiancé, acerbic experimental psychology professor James Moreland (Stephen Fry). There is an immediate [...] "electric" [...] connection which Ed recognizes, {{but she is}} not yet aware.|$|R

50|$|Later, he is {{bored with}} the {{marriage}} but he cannot leave his wife because they are 'bound'. Then <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> living-room at 10.30pm as she does every night, and asks him to turn out the gas before going to bed. Yet on this particular night she also asks him if he is cold, which he thinks is absurd.|$|R
50|$|With all the gangsters dead, Cutler and Chaffee run to {{the cabin}} again. Cutler speculates that the alien's leotard is made of radium and platinum, which protect her from the Earth's atmosphere. He mixes an acid {{solution}} that will melt her outfit and kill her. When <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cabin, he throws the acid on her. Dead, she dissolves into nothingness.|$|R
50|$|Another notable {{change is}} the {{elimination}} of the preliminary Fastest Finger First rounds, similar to the syndicated US show. McGuire simply calls out the contestant's name and he or <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> set and immediately sits in the hot seat, as opposed to before when 10 contestants had to answer a question correctly in the fastest time to get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hot seat.|$|R
60|$|His {{heart beat}} high as <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> apartment, {{and it was}} almost without an attempt to speak that his {{profound}} obeisance acknowledged her entrance.|$|E
60|$|That very evening <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hall {{after her}} drive {{and found him}} there sitting moodily by the deserted fireplace. She spoke to him directly.|$|E

60|$|There is the lodging-house slavey. She has a {{good heart}} and a smutty face and is always dressed {{according}} to the latest fashion in scarecrows. Her leading occupation is the cleaning of boots.

60|$|She {{closed the}} door behind her with {{trembling}} fingers. Then <b>she</b> <b>came</b> further <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room and confronted him.|$|R

5000|$|Jacques Lacan, {{inspired}} by Heidegger and Saussure, built on Freud's psychoanalytic {{model of the}} subject, in which the [...] "split subject" [...] is constituted by a double bind: alienated from jouissance {{when he or she}} leaves <b>the</b> Real, enters <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Imaginary (during the mirror stage), and separates from the Other when he or <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> realm of language, difference, and demand in the Symbolic or the Name of the Father.|$|R
