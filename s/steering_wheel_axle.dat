50|$|Although dune buggies can {{be bought}} (as a kit), many drivers make their own. This is done by {{separately}} buying chassis, engine, tires, <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> and <b>axles.</b> Some builders make their own chassis, which creates a special, customized vehicle.|$|R

After {{returning}} to Earth {{a second time}} it {{had the ability to}} change into RadiaCar Robo (RajiekkƒÅ Robo). Its head somewhat resembles Hello Kitty, and various parts of the robot retain a car-like motif, with the dashboard and <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> displayed on the waist, while <b>wheels</b> <b>axle</b> details are visible on the limbs. At first it could only transform into human size then later grow into a larger form (similar to the transformation sequence of Ultraman). The Radiacar Robo can only retain this form for one minute.|$|R
40|$|In {{conventional}} steering system, a feedback torque {{is produced}} from the contact between tire and road surface and its flows through mechanical column shaft directly to driver. This allows {{the driver to}} sense the steering feel during driving. However, in steer by wire (SBW) system, {{the elimination of the}} mechanical column shaft requires the system to generate the feedback torque which should produce similar performance with conventional steering system. Therefore, this paper proposes a control algorithm to create the force feedback torque for SBW system. The direct current measurement approach is used to estimate torque at the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and front <b>axle</b> motor as elements to the feedback torque, while, adding the compensation torque for a realistic feedback torque. The gain scheduling with a linear quadratic regulator controller is used to control the feedback torque and to vary a steering feel gain. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a real-time hardware in the loop (HIL) methodology is developed using Matlab XPC target toolbox. The results show that the proposed algorithm is able to generate the feedback torque similar to EPS steering system. Furthermore, the compensation torque is able to improve the steering feel and stabilize the system...|$|R
50|$|A {{wheel is}} a {{circular}} component that {{is intended to}} rotate on an <b>axle</b> bearing. The <b>wheel</b> {{is one of the}} main components of the <b>wheel</b> and <b>axle</b> which is one of the six simple machines. Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines.

50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned more to get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> A lower <b>steering</b> ratio means that the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher {{steering ratio}}, which will make the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is therefore harder to turn.|$|R

50|$|Prior to Nintendo's own Wii <b>Wheel,</b> several {{third-party}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories {{had been}} introduced for the Wii Remote. One released by Ubisoft, the Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel,</b> was developed by Thrustmaster. It is bundled with certain games, such as Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT Pro Series. The accessory, which is only for aesthetic/ergonomic enhancement, is meant for driving-style gameplay in which the Wii Remote would be held lengthwise in a two-handed gamepad orientation, steering the subject by tilting the controller. The Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> is also sold separately.
