6000|$|Alan Merrick strode {{from his}} father's door that day stung with a burning sense of wrong and injustice. More {{than ever before}} in his life he {{realized}} to himself the abject hollowness of that conventional code which masquerades in our midst as a system of morals. If he had continued to [...] "live single" [...] as we hypocritically phrase it, and so helped by one unit to spread the festering social canker of prostitution, on which as basis, like some mediaeval castle on its foul dungeon vaults, the entire superstructure of our outwardly decent modern society is reared, his father no doubt would have shrugged his shoulders and blinked his cold eyes, and commended the wise young man for abstaining from marriage till his means could permit him to keep a wife of his own class in the way she was accustomed to. The wretched victims of that vile system might die unseen and unpitied in some hideous back slum, without touching one chord of remorse or regret in Dr. Merrick's nature. He was steeled against their suffering. Or again, if Alan had sold his virility for gold to some rich heiress of his set, like Ethel Waterton--had bartered his freedom to be her wedded paramour in a loveless marriage, his father would not only have gladly acquiesced, but would have congratulated his son on his luck and his prudence. Yet, because Alan had chosen rather to form a blameless union of pure affection with a woman who was in every way his moral and mental superior, but in despite of the conventional ban of society, Dr. Merrick had cast him off as an open reprobate. And why? Simply because that union was unsanctioned by the exponents of a law they despised, and unblessed by the priests of a creed they rejected. Alan saw at once it is not the intrinsic moral value of an act such people think about, but the light in which it is regarded by a <b>selfish</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "Stratton-Porter {{established}} {{the pattern for}} her heroines with her depiction of Elnora Comstock in A Girl of the Limberlost, published in 1909, and the characterization of her protagonists remained virtually unchanged thereafter. Wholesome, sensible, and beautiful, Elnora is also compassionable, self-reliant, and intelligent: 'There was no form of suffering with which the girl could not sympathize, no work {{she was afraid to}} attempt, no subject she had investigated she did not understand.' When the handsome young hero arrives on the scene, he is immediately captivated by Elnora, even though he is already claimed by a physically attractive but <b>selfish</b> <b>society</b> girl. Elnora's virtue wins her the hero. Association with Elnora prompts the society girl to reform: she vows to be more like Elnora in the future." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Saliba's view, new {{religious}} movements should {{actually be}} treated as forms of religion, much like those that have arisen at all times throughout history, rather than as [...] "cults" [...] or a social problem specific to recent decades. Noting that new religions often appeal to young people who lack spiritual grounding, he has argued that involvement in such movements {{is not necessarily a}} dangerous distraction from the path to adulthood, but can also serve as a temporary haven in a materialistic and <b>selfish</b> <b>society,</b> providing [...] "an alternative therapy to many young adults as they are faced with making momentous decisions at important junctures in their lives". He has stated that many members of new religions appear to be healthy and happy, and that in many cases they move away from alcohol and drug use, gaining [...] "a degree of intellectual security, emotional stability and organised behavioural patterns that contrast sharply with their previously confused and chaotic existences". He also contends, based on statistical studies, that the appeal of new religious movements is often short-lived, with over 90% of members moving on within two years of joining. Given that new religions appear to fulfill a need that the mainstream churches are unable to address, he states {{that there is a need}} for [...] "some soul-searching on the part of the mainline churches".|$|E
5000|$|The story's {{period was}} moved from 1949-50 to 1970s Hollywood. The Long Goodbye has been {{described}} as [...] "a study of a moral and decent man cast adrift in a <b>selfish,</b> self-obsessed <b>society</b> where lives can be thrown away without a backward glance ... and any notions of friendship and loyalty are meaningless." ...|$|R
5000|$|Smith {{argued for}} a [...] "system of natural liberty" [...] where {{individual}} effort was the producer of social good. Smith believed even the <b>selfish</b> within <b>society</b> were kept under restraint and worked {{for the good of}} all when acting in a competitive market. Prices are often unrepresentative of the true value of goods and services. Following John Locke, Smith thought true value of things derived from the amount of labour invested in them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Religion!" [...] said St. Clare, in a {{tone that}} made both ladies look at him. [...] "Religion! Is what you hear at church, {{religion}}? Is that which can bend and turn, and descend and ascend, to fit every crooked phase of <b>selfish,</b> worldly <b>society,</b> religion? Is that religion which is less scrupulous, less generous, less just, less considerate for man, than even my own ungodly, worldly, blinded nature? No! When I look for a religion, I must look for something above me, and not something beneath." ...|$|R

Tessa Jowell was the Labour Minister responsible for setting it up and she talks to the psychotherapist and author of Love Matters and The <b>Selfish</b> <b>Society,</b> Sue Gerhardt, and Sarah Stewart Brown, Professor of Public Health at Warwick University. They discuss the central importance of early infancy in determining the life chances and psychological wellbeing of both children and adults...|$|E

40|$|In human <b>society</b> <b>selfish</b> use {{of common}} {{resources}} {{can lead to}} disaster, a situation known as the ‘tragedy of the commons’ (TOC). Although a TOC is usually prevented by coercion, theory predicts that close kinship ties can also favour reduced exploitation. We test this prediction using data on a TOC occurring in Melipona bee societies...|$|R
50|$|In Japan, {{a mother}} who works is {{commonly}} seen as <b>selfish</b> in a <b>society</b> where child-raising is linked directly with the physical closeness between mother and child. This emphasis can be a cause {{of the development of}} a kyōiku mama who always worries about her children's education success. This produces children that society views as lacking self-reliance, antisocial, and selfish.|$|R
6000|$|To {{this class}} did He belong, whose rising and setting on earth were for [...] "the healing of the nations;" [...] {{and to this}} class has belonged many a pure and devoted spirit, like him shining to cheer, like him fading away into the heavens. To this class many a one wishes to belong, who has an eye to {{distinguish}} the divinity of virtue, without the resolution to attain it; who, while they sweep along with the <b>selfish</b> current of <b>society,</b> still regret that society is not different--that they themselves are not different. If this train of thought has no very particular application to what follows, it was nevertheless suggested by it, and of its relevancy others must judge.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn many {{hymenopteran}} insect <b>societies,</b> <b>selfish</b> {{workers are}} policed, as selfishness can negatively affect the average inclusive fitness {{of one or}} both castes by reducing either the degree of average relatedness to the colony's male offspring or colony efficiency. In stingless bees, the rapid capping of brood cells could aid in controlling selfishness; to this end, we studied cell-sealing efficacy in Melipona bicolor. Execution of cell sealing {{was found to be}} both rapid and almost continuous. Comparing the performance of reproductive and non-reproductive workers, the former sealed the cells more efficiently when they contained their own eggs, but less so when the queens' eggs were involved. We argue that the occurrence of disruptions in cell sealing through self-serving reproductive workers is capable of undermining sealing efficacy as a policing instrument, thus making reproductive workers potential rogue individuals...|$|R
40|$|Productive {{public good}} {{investment}} allocations, and group discriminatory redistributions are conflicting resource use options between which every government must choose irrespective {{of its political}} make up. This paper {{is the first to}} derive an incisive explanation of how governments combine political and economic calculation to balance these competing choices. The political logic of these economic decisions will lie on a spectrum between two polar extremes. At one extremes is an idealized, utopian, consensual democracy. At the other extreme is perfect autocracy ruled by a dictator who taxes and spends solely to satisfy his own <b>selfish</b> desires. Realistic <b>societies</b> can be analyzed as a mixture [...] a weighted sum [...] of these two polar cases. Thus, in making the choice between social investment and redistributive taxation from the powerless to the powerful, every government behaves somewhat like an pure democracy and somewhat like a selfish dictatorshi...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s, a {{new form}} of Cuban literature, known as [...] "Cuban Dirty Realism" [...] by critics became popular, {{reflecting}} the [...] "prisoners, prostitutes, drug users, alcoholics, thieves, and murderers whose lives involve lots of sex, drinking, drugs" [...] in Cuba. Prostitution grew dramatically during this period, fueled by the increase in tourism in the country and legalization of dollars in 1992. Prostitution isn't illegal in Cuba, but is frowned on by many and is morally reprehensible and considered to be a [...] "social disease" [...] and a [...] "product of pre-revolutionary <b>society's</b> <b>selfish</b> capitalist culture." [...] The authorities in Cuba have organized various campaigns against it since the early Castro days, attempting to encourage women to seek more formal employment in factories and gain skills such as sewing. During the 1998 campaign, Cuban police patrolled areas such as Varadero Beach and the Cuban Keys, key tourist areas affected by it. According to reports though, prostitutes often offer bribes to enforcement officers.|$|R
40|$|The Nigerian State is {{a victim}} of {{high-level}} corruption, bad governance, political instability and a cyclical legitimacy crisis. Consequently, national development is retarded, and the political environment uncertain. The country’s authoritarian leadership faced a legitimacy crisis, political intrigues, in an ethnically- differentiated polity, where ethnic competition for resources drove much of the pervasive corruption and profligacy. While the political gladiators constantly manipulated the people and the political processes to advance their own <b>selfish</b> agenda, the <b>society</b> remained pauperized, and the people wallowed in abject poverty. This invariably led to weak legitimacy, as the citizens lacked faith in their political leaders and by extension, the political system. Participation in government was low because citizens perceived it as irrelevant to their lives. In the absence of support from civil society, the effective power of government was eroded. Patron- client relationships took a prime role over the formal aspects of politics, such as the rule of law, well-functioning political parties, and a credible electoral system. In order to break this cycle and ensure good governance, accountability and transparency must be guaranteed...|$|R
