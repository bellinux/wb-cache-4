The modeled crater depth-diameter is strongly dependent on thermal gradient and temperature of the warm convective ice. Our results indicate that both a fully conductive (thin) shell and a conductive-convective (thick) shell can reproduce the observed crater depth-diameter and morphologies. For the conductive <b>ice</b> <b>shell</b> over ocean, the best fit is an approximately 8 km thick conductive <b>ice</b> <b>shell.</b> Depending on the temperature (255 - 265 K) and therefore strength of warm convective ice, the thickness of the conductive ice lid is estimated at 5 - 7 km.

40|$|The angular {{momentum}} of the atmosphere and of the hydrocarbon lakes of Titan have a large equatorial component that can excite polar motion, a variable orientation of the rotation axis of Titan with respect to its surface. We here use the {{angular momentum}} obtained from a General Circulation Model of the atmosphere of Titan and from an Ocean Circulation Model for Titan's polar lakes to model the polar motion of Titan {{as a function of}} the interior structure. Besides the gravitational torque exerted by Saturn on Titan's aspherical mass distribution, the rotational model also includes torques arising due to the presence of an ocean under a thin <b>ice</b> <b>shell</b> as well as the influence of the elasticity of the different layers. The Chandler wobble period of a solid and rigid Titan without its atmosphere is about 279 years. The period of the Chandler wobble is mainly influenced by the atmosphere of Titan (- 166 years) and the presence of an internal global ocean (+ 135 to 295 years depending on the internal model) and to a lesser extent by the elastic deformations (+ 3. 7 years). The forced polar motion of a solid and rigid Titan is elliptical with an amplitude of about 50 m and a main period equal to the orbital period of Saturn. It is mainly forced by the atmosphere of Titan while the lakes of Titan are at the origin of a displacement of the mean polar motion, or polar offset. The subsurface ocean can largely increase the polar motion amplitude due to resonant amplification with a wobble free mode of Titan. The amplitudes as well as the main periods of the polar motion depend on whether and which forcing period is close to the period of a free mode. For a thick <b>ice</b> <b>shell,</b> the polar motion mainly has an annual period and an amplitude of about 1 km. For thinner <b>ice</b> <b>shells,</b> the polar motion amplitude can reach several tens of km and shorter periods become dominant.

The thin-shell model states that the <b>ice</b> <b>shell</b> {{is only a few}} kilometers thick, transfers heat by conduction only, and can become locally thinner until it exposes an underlying ocean on the satellite’s surface. According to the thick-shell model, the <b>ice</b> <b>shell</b> may be several tens of kilometers thick and have a lower convective layer, above which there is a cold stagnant lid that dissipates heat by conduction. Whichever the case, from magnetic data there is strong support for the presence of a layer of salty liquid water under the ice. The present study was performed to examine whether the possibility of convection is theoretically consistent with surface heat flows of 100 – 200 mW m 2, deduced from a thin brittle lithosphere, and with the typical spacing of 15 – 23 km proposed for the features usually known as lenticulae.

Comparison with current <b>ice</b> <b>shell</b> thickness estimations and key observables such as mean density, moment of inertia factor or heat flux allows to further constrain the satellite's core density. We start from building internal structural reference models composed of four spherically symmetric homogeneous layers: a core, a salty liquid water layer, a lower warm ductile ice layer and an upper cold brittle ice layer. Since the total <b>ice</b> <b>shell</b> thickness is small compared to the satellite's mean radius (less than 10 %), we apply and validate the thin shell approximation. It allows us to further compute a three dimensional thermodynamic model of the ice-ocean system accounting for the dissipation of tidal energy induced by diurnal tides. We show that the higher the core density, the thinner the <b>ice</b> <b>shell</b> to keep the salty ocean density within a realistic range (typically below 1250 kg m- 3).

Gravity and shape data points to a 99 ± 23 km thick <b>ice</b> <b>shell</b> crust on top of a 65 ± 30 internal liquid water global ocean. Neither moon has a shape close to hydrostatic equilibrium; the deviations are maintained by isostasy. Dione's <b>ice</b> <b>shell</b> is thought to vary in thickness by less than 5%, with the thinnest areas at the poles, where tidal heating of the crust is greatest.|$|R
