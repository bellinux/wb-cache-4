40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} of the <b>production</b> <b>lag</b> for the firm's decisions. The authors establish a significant relationship between price behavior and the length of the <b>production</b> <b>lag.</b> They show that specific results in the literature are crucially dependent upon the assumption about the <b>production</b> <b>lag.</b> By allowing the production time to exceed the decision period, the basic framework of the earlier price-inventory models is significantly extended. The model, thus, incorporates finished-goods inventories as well as goods-in-process inventories. Copyright 1992 by The London School of Economics and Political Science. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} cobweb theorem {{is extended}} to include <b>production</b> <b>lags</b> and price forecasts. Price forecasting {{based on a}} longer period has a stabilizing effect on prices. Longer <b>production</b> <b>lags</b> do not necessarily lead to unstable prices; very long lags lead to cycles of constant amplitude. The classical cobweb requires elasticity of demand to be {{greater than that of}} supply; this is not necessarily the case in a more general setting, price forecasting has a stabilizing effect.

40|$|Seemingly Unrelated Regression {{models were}} {{used to examine the}} factors that {{influence}} the corn acreage in selected states in the US. Planted acre was modelled as a function of lagged planted acres, <b>lagged</b> <b>production,</b> and <b>lagged</b> price for states California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and the US. States such as New Jersey and New York which have a short growing season compared to California and Florida. Also there is a notion that the small acreage in New Jersey is affected by production from other states such as California, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania. The results indicate that lagged planted acreage significantly contributes toward current planted acres of sweet corn in all the five states and in the US. <b>Production</b> <b>lag</b> significantly contributes toward planted acres only in New York. Finally, the price lag significantly contributes toward planted acres in New York and Pennsylvania. The sign of the significant variable indicates that the current planted acre is positively influenced by the <b>lagged</b> planted acres, <b>production</b> <b>lag</b> and the price lag. ...|$|R

30|$|Given these considerations, {{for this}} study a dynamic input–output model with <b>production</b> <b>lags</b> and {{classical}} features is used. This specific model construction has the following three advantages. First, its input–output matrix still represents production technology. Second, {{it is possible to}} address joint production using this methodological framework. Third and more importantly, this model, which is Sraffa–von Neumann orientated and which has a classical tradition, does not suffer from the problem of “capital” as does the neo-classical theory. Hence, this study’s model is more logically consistent.|$|R
40|$|Building on a {{contribution}} by Paul Zak, {{we consider the}} modified Solow model with a time lag introduced in the Kaleckian spirit.

Using graph theory we show that imprimitivity leads to cyclical <b>production</b> <b>lags</b> also in decomposable economies, although in such a case the property must not be referred to the matrix representing the economy but to its indecomposable sub-matrices along the block-diagonal. The structure of the overall flow of commodities depends on both the number of imprimitive sub-matrices and their imprimitivity index. ...|$|R

Monetary policy aimed at stabilizing real balances can support nonstationary equilibrium paths that converge to a limit cycle, which has Keynesian features. The first welfare theorem does not hold because the price level appears in the production function through liquidity costs, so that production has a positive externality.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>production</b> <b>lags</b> and business cycles {{has a long}} history in economics, but was first analyzed rigorously by Michal Kalecki in 1935. In a linear delay differential equation model, Kalecki showed that production delays can endogenously generate cycles. Whether this result holds in general equilibrium has been an open question. An answer is provided by examining the effect of Kaleckian lags in the Solow and Cass-Koopmans growth models. It is shown that such models do produce endogenous cycles, confirming that Kalecki's model relating lags to cycles holds in general equilibrium settings. ...|$|R

In his model, when prices are high more investments are made. Their effect, however, is delayed due to the breeding time. Then the market becomes saturated {{which leads to a}} decline in prices. As a result of this, production is reduced but the effects {{take a long time to}} be noticed but then lead to increased demand and again increased prices. This procedure repeats itself cyclically. The resulting supply-demand graph resembles a cobweb.|$|R

40|$|<b>Production</b> and {{marketing}} <b>lags</b> in agri-food supply chains force competitive primary producers and food processors {{to commit to}} output targets before prices and exchange rates are realized. A theoretical model with one processor and many price-taking primary producers is developed to show that {{an increase in the}} volatility of the export price generally increases exports under risk neutrality. Furthermore, relaxing the assumption that the processing firm is risk neutral introduces non- linearities in the relationship between exports and export price volatility. This relationship is empirically investigated using the flexible non-linear inference framework developed by Hamilton (2001). The theoretical model provides the foundation for empirical bilateral export equations for Canadian pork exports to the U. S. and Japan. The empirical investigation supports the hypothesis that export price volatility has statistically significant non-linear effects on Canadian pork exports.

40|$|A {{change in}} market {{conditions}} can trigger a cyclical {{response in the}} housing market, a cycle in both prices and number of transactions. This is caused not only by <b>production</b> <b>lags</b> {{but also by the}} reactions of buyers and sellers. The fact that many buyers are also sellers, and vice versa, has a special effect on this cycle. In this paper a theory of this cycle in prices and transactions is developed and empirically tested. It is found that volume changes are much more closely related statistically to changes in market conditions that are price changes. A clear cycle is found in two of the four towns studied. ...|$|R
40|$|A stylized fact {{associated}} with inventory behavior is that durable goods production and inventory investment are about 5 times more volatile {{than those of}} nondurable goods. This paper shows that the stockout-avoidance theory of inventories (Kahn, AER 1987) featuring demand uncertainty and <b>production</b> <b>lags</b> is inconsistent with this stylized fact. The predicted variance of production is negatively related {{to the degree of}} durability of consumption goods. In particular, production is less variable both absolutely and relative to sales when consumption goods are more durable. In addition, durable goods production can be less variable than sales even under serially correlated demand shocks. These predictions run counter to the data. ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} <b>production</b> {{and marketing}} <b>lags</b> in agri-food supply chains that force competitive {{producers and processors}} to commit to output targets before prices and exchange rates are realized. We show that export markets act as put options for exporters {{and an increase in}} the volatility of the real exchange rate will generally increase exports. Relaxing the assumptions about the real exchange rate distribution and risk preferences of producers and/or processors can introduce non-linearities in the relationship between exports and real exchange rate volatility. This relationship is investigated using the flexible non-linear inference framework of Hamilton (2001). Bilateral export equations for Canadian pork exports to the U. S. and Japan are specified. The empirical model shows that real exchange rate volatility has statistically significant non-linear effects on aggregate pork exports. Moreover, bilateral pork exports are less sensitive to country- specific variables than aggregate volatility in the real exchange rate.
