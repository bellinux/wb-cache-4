5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the <b>Sun</b> and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the <b>Sun.</b> This can happen only at new moon when the <b>Sun</b> and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the <b>Sun</b> is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the <b>Sun</b> is obscured.|$|E
5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the <b>Sun.</b> The actual speed with which Earth orbits the <b>Sun</b> varies slightly during the year, so {{the speed with which}} the <b>Sun</b> seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the <b>Sun</b> is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time.|$|E
5|$|An annular eclipse {{occurs when}} the <b>Sun</b> and Moon are exactly {{in line with the}} Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of the Moon is smaller than that of the <b>Sun.</b> Hence the <b>Sun</b> appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E
50|$|The 1986 - 87 Phoenix <b>Suns</b> {{season was}} the 18th {{season for the}} Phoenix <b>Suns</b> of the National Basketball Association. The <b>Suns</b> started their 14th season under head coach John MacLeod, going 22 - 34. <b>Suns</b> {{management}} decided to replace the longstanding MacLeod with Dick Van Arsdale, a former <b>Suns</b> player from the Finals team coached then by MacLeod. With Van Arsdale, the <b>Suns</b> would finish the season going 14 - 12 in their last 26 games of the regular season. All <b>Suns</b> home games were played at Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum.|$|R

5000|$|The 2010-11 Phoenix <b>Suns</b> season [...] was the 43rd {{season for}} the Phoenix <b>Suns</b> of the National Basketball Association (NBA). For {{the first time in}} eight seasons, the <b>Suns</b> will be without the play of power forward Amar'e Stoudemire, a 5-time All-Star and former Rookie of the Year who joined the New York Knicks in the summer. The <b>Suns</b> traded Jason Richardson on December 18, 2010 as part of a trade that brought Vince Carter to the <b>Suns.</b> On February 24, 2011, the <b>Suns</b> traded Goran Dragić and the draft pick they got earlier from Orlando in {{exchange}} for Aaron Brooks. Alvin Gentry was head coach and the <b>Suns</b> played their home games at US Airways Center.|$|R

5|$|Ariadne persuades Litsas, {{a former}} Second World War {{resistance}} fighter {{and friend of}} her late father, to help them by telling him about the involvement in the plot of former Nazi, Von Richter. Trying to find M and Colonel <b>Sun,</b> Bond is nearly captured by the Russians, but is saved by Litsas. Finally, Bond finds Sun's headquarters, but is knocked out by one of Sun's men; Bond learns that Von Richter will use a mortar to destroy the conference venue and that Bond will be tortured by <b>Sun,</b> before his inevitable demise. <b>Sun</b> tortures him brutally, until {{one of the girls}} at the house is ordered by <b>Sun</b> to caress Bond fondly. In the process she cuts one of Bond's hands free and provides him with a knife. She tells <b>Sun</b> that Bond is dead: when examined Bond stabs <b>Sun.</b> He then frees other captives who help Bond stop Von Richter. However <b>Sun</b> survives the stab wound and kills several of the other escapees. Bond tracks down <b>Sun</b> and kills him in the confrontation. The Soviets thank Bond for saving their conference, offering him a medal for his work, which he politely turns down.|$|E
5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% {{of the mass of}} the <b>Sun.</b> The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than the <b>Sun</b> and the star has a smaller radius. These factors combine to make the star only 1.24% as luminous as the <b>Sun,</b> and most of this is at infrared wavelengths.|$|E
50|$|The 2000-01 NBA {{season was}} the 33rd {{season for the}} Phoenix <b>Suns,</b> members of the Pacific Division in the National Basketball Association. During the offseason, the <b>Suns</b> signed free agents Mario Elie and Tony Delk. The <b>Suns</b> were coached by Scott Skiles, who enjoyed his first full season as head coach as the <b>Suns</b> {{finished}} the regular season with a 51-31 record. For a franchise-record 13th season in a row, the <b>Suns</b> earned {{a trip to the}} playoffs, but would later lose in the first round. America West Arena was the home court venue for the <b>Suns.</b>|$|R

5|$|As an A-type main {{sequence}} star, Beta Pictoris is more luminous than the Sun: combining the apparent magnitude of 3.861 with {{the distance of}} 19.44 parsecs gives an absolute magnitude of 2.42, {{as compared to the}} <b>Sun,</b> which has an absolute magnitude of 4.83. This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 times greater than that of the <b>Sun.</b> When the entire spectrum of radiation from Beta Pictoris and the <b>Sun</b> is taken into account, Beta Pictoris is found to be 8.7 times more luminous than the <b>Sun.</b>|$|E
5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the <b>Sun</b> and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% {{greater than that of}} the <b>Sun</b> and it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of the <b>Sun</b> and is therefore described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is also more enriched than the <b>Sun</b> in the element helium.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the <b>Sun</b> is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the <b>Sun</b> similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the <b>Sun</b> in the same way, {{but not as much}} as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the <b>Sun</b> in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the <b>Sun</b> in early January.|$|E

5|$|Colonel <b>Sun</b> is {{the only}} non-Fleming Bond novel adapted as a comic strip by the Daily Express newspaper. It was adapted by Jim Lawrence and drawn by Yaroslav Horak and {{published}} in the Daily Express from 1 December 1969 to 20 August 1970 and was subsequently syndicated worldwide. In December 2005, Titan Books reprinted Colonel <b>Sun</b> and included River of Death, another original James Bond comic strip story published before the Colonel <b>Sun</b> strip in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Earth is {{the third}} planet from the <b>Sun</b> and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, {{especially}} the <b>Sun</b> and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the <b>Sun</b> in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E
5|$|From 1964–2010, {{and again}} since 2012, the Flag of Malawi {{is made up}} of three equal {{horizontal}} stripes of black, red and green with a red rising <b>sun</b> superimposed {{in the center of the}} black stripe. The black stripe represented the African people, the red represented the blood of martyrs for African freedom, green represented Malawi's ever-green nature and the rising <b>sun</b> represented the dawn of freedom and hope for Africa. In 2010, the flag was changed, removing the red rising <b>sun</b> and adding a full white <b>sun</b> in the center as a symbol of Malawi's economic progress. The change was reverted in 2012.|$|E

5|$|From {{at least}} the 4th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the <b>Sun</b> was worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and {{surrounded}} by a serpent. In the New Empire period, the <b>Sun</b> became identified with the dung beetle, whose spherical ball of dung was identified with the <b>Sun.</b> In {{the form of the}} <b>Sun</b> disc Aten, the <b>Sun</b> had a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.|$|E
5|$|HD 28185 {{is similar}} to our <b>Sun</b> in terms of mass, radius, and luminosity. The star is on the main {{sequence}} and is generating energy by fusing hydrogen in its core. The spectral type of G5V implies HD 28185 is cooler than the <b>Sun.</b> Like the majority of extrasolar planet host stars, HD 28185 is metal-rich relative to the <b>Sun,</b> containing around 173% of the solar abundance of iron. The star rotates slower than the <b>Sun,</b> with a period of around 30 days, compared to 25.4 days for the <b>Sun.</b>|$|E
