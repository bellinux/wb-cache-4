[...] We had to plant some roots, lest we <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> songs about living on a tour bus. So we had to fall in love, we had to fall out of love, we had to make homes." [...] Guitarist Michael Einziger elaborated further, [...] "It just got to this point where we had been going strong for such {{a long period of time}} that we really accomplished all of our goals. [...] It was like, 'Ok, well what do we do now?' Obviously there are lots of things to do but I think we wanted to take some time, each of us personally, to explore a little bit and find out what the rest of the world was like." [...] Bassist Ben Kenney stated, [...] "Being with music is a creative thing and requires a certain amount of creativity - to just keep going back to that well over and over again, it doesn’t have a chance to replenish." ...|$|E

5000|$|By {{the nineteenth}} century, {{attention}} was increasingly given to developing quality penmanship in Eastern schools.

5000|$|The {{basic idea}} is that as time progresses, the ear becomes acclimatised {{to more and more}} complex sounds. This happens not just for {{individuals}} but also for societies as they <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> more complex music. Consonance and dissonance become indistinct from each other: dissonances slowly become heard as consonances. Jim Samson explained it this way: [...] "As the ear becomes acclimatized to a sonority within a particular context, the sonority will gradually become 'emancipated' from that context and seek a new one. The emancipation of the dominant-quality dissonances has followed this pattern, with the dominant seventh developing in status from a contrapuntal note in the sixteenth century to a quasi-consonant harmonic note in the early nineteenth. By the later nineteenth century the higher numbered dominant-quality dissonances had also achieved harmonic status, with resolution delayed or omitted completely. The greater autonomy of the dominant-quality dissonance contributed significantly to the weakening of traditional tonal function within a purely diatonic context." ...|$|E

"Hacia lo salvaje" [...] is {{the name}} of the sixth album by the band, {{released}} on 27 September 2011, already under the new brand created for the band, called [...] "Antártida" [...] and also produced by them, Juan Aguirre and Juan de Dios Martín. Eva explains the name of the brand saying that “since we edited the CD with our own brand, it turned out that we didn´t have a name because we are a bit of a mess (laughs). We also didn´t care too much about it being our brand or Pepito Records. We decided to name it “Antártida” because we were recording that song at the moment and so it gave us the idea. We loved the image of the Antártida, a place totally idealized because we´ve never been there. But we loved the whiteness, something so pure and so real that it blinds you. It also brought us to the idea of that blank paper you have to face every time you <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a song”.|$|E
