5|$|Aimed at {{improving}} employment opportunities in business, the Lillebaelt Academy of Professional Higher Education (Erhvervsakademiet Lillebælt) {{was established in}} 2009 {{as a result of}} a merger between Tietgen Business College, SDE college, Kold College and Vejle Business College. In 2014, it had 3,200 <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> staff of 300. Its programmes are offered at various locations in Odense and Vejle.

5|$|Although {{expected}} {{to accommodate the}} needs of the entire workforce, by late 1944 expansion of both the electromagnetic and gaseous diffusion plants led to forecasts of a population of 62,000. This prompted another round of construction that saw an additional 1,300 family units and 20 dormitories built. More shopping and recreational facilities were added, the schools were expanded to accommodate 9,000 <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> 50-bed annex was added to the hospital. The number of school children reached 8,223 in 1945. Few issues resonated more with the scientists and highly skilled workers than the quality of the education system. Although school staff were nominally employees of the Anderson County Education Board, the school system was run autonomously, with federal funding under the supervision of administrators appointed by the Army. Teachers enjoyed salaries that were considerably higher than those of Anderson County. The population of Oak Ridge peaked at 75,000 in May 1945, by which time 82,000 people were employed at the Clinton Engineer Works, and 10,000 by Roane-Anderson.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 1999, Columbine High School {{students}} Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold {{shot dead}} 12 <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> teacher and wounded 21 others, before committing suicide. In {{the aftermath of}} the school shooting, the band were widely reported to have influenced the killings; early media reports alleged that the shooters were fans, and were wearing the group's T-shirts during the massacre. Although these claims were later proven to be false, speculation in national media and among the public continued to blame Manson's music and imagery for inciting Harris and Klebold. Later reports revealed that the two were not fans—and, in fact, had disliked the band's music. Despite this, Marilyn Manson (as well as other bands and forms of entertainment, such as movies and video games) were widely criticized by religious, political, and entertainment-industry figures.|$|E

5|$|Schooling is {{compulsory}} {{from the}} age of five, although free-of-charge kindergarten is available to all students beginning at age three. Approximately 94 per cent of three- and four-year-olds attend kindergarten. A number of private operators exist, but free state-run institutions are also popular. State-run Maltese kindergartens are required to have one staff member present for every ten children present, while this ratio decreases to 1:20 for independently run institutions. During the kindergarten years, the focus is on play, not formal education. From kindergarten, students transition to primary school, which is compulsory {{from the age}} of five. Since 1980, all state-run primary schools have been co-educational, with many independent schools following suit. However, church-run primary schools are usually single-sex. Classes usually have a limit of thirty <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> minimum teacher to student ratio has been set at 1:19 in all schools, whether they be state-run, church-run or independent.|$|E
