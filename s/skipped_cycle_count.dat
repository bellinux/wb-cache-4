50|$|A <b>cycle</b> <b>count</b> is an {{inventory}} auditing procedure, which falls under inventory management, {{where a small}} subset of inventory, in a specific location, is counted on a specified day. <b>Cycle</b> <b>counts</b> contrast with traditional physical inventory in that a full physical inventory may stop operation at a facility while all items are counted at one time. <b>Cycle</b> <b>counts</b> are less disruptive to daily operations, provide an ongoing measure of inventory accuracy and procedure execution, and can be tailored to focus on items with higher value, higher movement volume, or that are critical to business processes. <b>Cycle</b> <b>counting</b> should only be performed in facilities {{with a high degree}} of inventory accuracy (greater than 95%). The purpose of <b>cycle</b> <b>counting</b> is to verify the inventory accuracy and even though it is not an adequate procedure to be used to correct inventory errors, it is an adequate way to identify the root causes of inventory errors.|$|R

These systems may include mobile computers with integrated barcode scanners that allow the operator to automatically identify items, and enter inventory counts via keypad. The software then transmits data to a database on a host system which can generate inventory reports.Based on user defined criteria, the software will select a number of items to count at specific locations for the specified period of time. Ideally, these selections are daily but many companies choose to generate <b>cycle</b> <b>count</b> items weekly.Many companies perform [...] "mini" [...] physical inventories and call it <b>cycle</b> <b>counts.</b> Instead of using random or system generated part numbers at specific locations to count, they selectively choose specific locations and count everything in those locations.

The research indicated that selecting the ABC categorization method of <b>Cycle</b> <b>Counting</b> will be the best choice when combined with the color coding and buffer principles of Buffer Time Management.

40|$|Software {{pipelining}} is {{an effective}} technique to reduce <b>cycle</b> <b>count</b> by exploiting instruction level parallelism in loops. It has been implemented in most VLIW DSP compilers. However, software pipelining expands the code size due {{to the introduction of}} prelude and postlude. To address this problem, many VLIW DSP compilers include certain code size reduction features. During compilation, a user is given limited options of exercising these code reduction features. As a result, the tradeoff options between <b>cycle</b> <b>count</b> and code size are also limited. Yet today’s software development often requires an optimum balance between code size and <b>cycle</b> <b>count,</b> which in turn requires a much wider tradeoff space. This paper presents a new heuristic code-size-constraint loop optimization approach to extend the tradeoff space. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the new approach can significantly widen the tradeoff space, thus providing DSP users with more flexibility to meet their various design criteria. 1...|$|R

40|$|Inventory record {{inaccuracy}} deteriorates {{supply chain}} performance because {{it leads to}} ineffective replenishment decisions. Conducting <b>cycle</b> <b>counts</b> (i. e., periodic inventory auditing) is a common approach to correcting inventory records. It is not clear, however, how inaccuracy at different locations affects supply chain performance and how an effective cycle-count program for a multistage supply chain should be designed. This paper aims {{to answer these questions}} by considering a serial supply chain that has inventory record inaccuracy and operates under local base-stock policies. A random error, representing a stock loss, such as shrinkage or invisible demand, reduces the physical inventory at each location in each period. The errors are cumulative and are not observed until a location performs a <b>cycle</b> <b>count.</b> We provide a simple recursion to evaluate the system cost and propose an effective heuristic for the best base-stock levels. For a two-stage system with identical error distributions, we prove that it is more effective to conduct more frequent <b>cycle</b> <b>counts</b> at the downstream stage. In a numerical study of more general systems, we find that the above conclusion holds unless an upstream stage has a significantly higher error rate. In particular, more <b>cycle</b> <b>counts</b> should be allocated to a downstream stage when (1) the ratio of its lead time to the total system lead time is small, (2) the ratio of its holding cost to the total system holding cost is large, or (3) the number of stages in the supply chain is large. The analysis and insights generated from our study can be used to design guidelines or scorecard systems that help managers design better cycle-count policies. Finally, we discuss implications of our study on RFID investments in a supply chain. (Key words: inventory inaccuracy, <b>cycle</b> <b>counts,</b> multi-echelon systems, RFID) 1...|$|R
