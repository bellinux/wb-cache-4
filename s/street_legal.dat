40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{introducing}} <b>legal</b> <b>street</b> prostitution zones on both registered and perceived crime. We exploit a unique setting in the Netherlands where <b>legal</b> <b>street</b> prostitution zones were opened in nine cities under different regulation systems. We provide evidence that the opening of these zones was not in response to changes in crime. Our difference-in-difference analysis using data on the largest 25 Dutch cities between 1994 and 2011 shows that opening a <b>legal</b> <b>street</b> prostitution zone decreases registered sexual abuse and rape by about 30 % to 40 % {{in the first two}} years. For cities which opened a <b>legal</b> <b>street</b> prostitution zone with a licensing system we also find significant reductions in drug-related crime and long-term effects on sexual assaults. Perceived drug nuisance increases upon opening but then decreases below pre-opening levels in cities with a licensed prostitution zone. In contrast, we find permanent increases in perceived drug crime in the areas adjacent to the legal prostitution zones...|$|R

5000|$|Conversely, several {{commentators}} have found much depth {{and meaning in}} the song's lyrics. Noted Dylan expert Michael Gray, author of The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, commented that [...] "Changing of the Guards" [...] is a thorough description of Dylan's journey, {{from the beginning of}} his musical career, about sixteen years prior (the opening line is [...] "Sixteen years"), through his marriage and divorce with Sara Dylan, up to his soon-to-be-announced conversion to Christianity. Indeed, much religious and biblical imagery is readily apparent in this work, especially apocalyptic imagery—not new ground for Dylan. Dylan once commented: [...] "It means something different every time I sing it. 'Changing of the Guards' is a thousand years old'". However, even the song's critical supporters admit that there is a good amount of opacity in this song's lyrics: [...] "Like much in 'Changing of the Guards', the intended meaning of this passage is opaque..." [...] The deliberate ambiguity of the lyrics, prompting such debate, marked <b>Street</b> <b>Legal's</b> effective abandonment of the narrative approach which dominated his previous album Desire.|$|R
