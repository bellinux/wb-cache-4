40|$|Abstract Background Few {{data are}} {{available}} on dual burden of under and over nutrition {{of children in the}} Pacific region. The objective was to examine prevalence of <b>stunting</b> at birth and current <b>stunting</b> and their relationship to obesity in US Affiliated Pacific (USAP) jurisdictions. Methods Cross sectional survey with cluster sampling by community. 5558, 2 – 8  years olds were measured in 51 communities in 11 USAP jurisdictions. The main outcome measures were <b>stunting</b> at birth, current <b>stunting</b> and obesity by body mass index. Prevalences of <b>stunting</b> at birth, current <b>stunting</b> and obesity were determined, adjusting for age distribution and community clustering. Differences by among age, sex, race and jurisdiction income levels were evaluated by chi-square analysis. Relationships of <b>stunting</b> at birth and current <b>stunting</b> with obesity were examined using a hierarchical model accounting for the study design. Results Prevalences were <b>stunting</b> at birth 6. 8 % (Standard Error, SE =  0. 9 %), current <b>stunting</b> 1. 4 % (SE =  0. 2 %) and obesity 14. 03. 8 % (SE =  0. 9 %). Obesity was highest in upper middle income jurisdictions (UMIJ) at 17. 5 %. <b>Stunting</b> at birth differed by race (p =  0. 0001) with highest prevalence among Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders (10. 7 %). Prevalence of <b>stunting</b> at birth was different by jurisdiction income level with 27. 5 % in lower middle income jurisdictions (LMIJ), and 22. 2 % in UMIJ, and 5. 5 % in higher than high income jurisdictions (HIJ) at 5. 5 % (p <  0. 0001). Prevalence of current <b>stunting</b> was higher in LMIJ than HIJ (p =  0. 001), although children with current <b>stunting</b> were less likely to have been <b>stunted</b> at birth. The association between <b>stunting</b> at birth and current <b>stunting</b> was negative (OR =  0. 19, 95 % CI: 0. 05 – 0. 69). Conclusions Currently <b>stunted</b> children were marginally less likely to be obese than not <b>stunted</b> children in the USAP, where the prevalence of current <b>stunting</b> is low. <b>Stunting</b> (at birth and current) was highest in LMIJ, while UMIJ jurisdictions had the highest dual burden of malnutrition (that is the highest combination of both <b>stunting</b> at birth and obesity).

40|$|Abstract Background Prevalence {{of child}} <b>stunting</b> in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) {{is among the}} highest in the world. There is a need to {{systematically}} investigate how <b>stunting</b> operates at different levels of determination and identify major factors contributing to the development of <b>stunting.</b> The aim of this study was to look for key determinants of <b>stunting</b> in the DRC. Methods This study used data from the DRC Demographic Health Survey 2013 – 14 which included anthropometric measurement for 9030 under 5  year children. Height-for-Age Z score was calculated and classified according to the WHO guideline. The association between <b>stunting</b> and bio-demographic characteristics was assessed using logistic regression. Results Prevalence of <b>stunting</b> was much higher in boys than girls. There was a significant rural urban gap in the prevalence of <b>stunting</b> with rural areas having a larger proportion of children living with <b>stunting</b> than urban. Male children, older than 6  months, preceding birth interval less than 24  months, being from lower wealth quintiles had the highest odds of <b>stunting.</b> Several provinces had in particular high odds of <b>stunting.</b> Early initiation of breastfeeding, mother’s age more than 20  years at the time of delivery had lower odds of <b>stunting.</b> The taller the mother the less likely the child was to be <b>stunted.</b> Similarly, mother’s BMI, access to safe water, access to hygienic toilet, mother’s education were found negatively correlated with child <b>stunting</b> in the bivariate logistic regression, but they lost statistical significance in multivariate analysis together with numbers of children in the family and place of residence. Conclusions Child <b>stunting</b> is widespread in the DRC and increasing prevalence is worrisome. This study has identified modifiable factors determining high prevalence of <b>stunting</b> in the DRC. Policy implementation should in particular target provinces with high prevalence of <b>stunting</b> and address modifiable determinants such as reducing socioeconomic disparity.

Filmed on the streets of Hato Rey, the chaotic scene demanded specific timing that had to be synchronized with the various character interactions also occurring during the scene. Razatos chose to use a series of camera cars including a crane-mounted camera atop a Porsche Cayenne, which allowed him to film from a variety of angles and heights while the vehicles were in motion, and a Subaru Impreza with a steel cage built around it that allowed for tracking shots. The Subaru's driver Allen Padelford would occasionally accidentally collide with the vault, creating a shower of sparks that inadvertently became useful footage. Padelford also developed a top-mount dual-drive system for the Chargers that allowed a <b>stunt</b> driver to control the vehicle from the roof, while the actor focused on their performance inside the car.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of <b>stunting</b> and underlying factors operating at meso-scale {{is of paramount importance}} for intervention designing and implementations. Yet, {{little is known about the}} {{spatial distribution of}} <b>stunting</b> and some discrepancies are documented on the relative importance of reported risk factors. Therefore, the present study aims at exploring the spatial distribution of <b>stunting</b> at meso- (district) scale, and evaluates the effect of spatial dependency on the identification of risk factors and their relative contribution to the occurrence of <b>stunting</b> and severe <b>stunting</b> in a rural area of Ethiopia. A community based cross sectional study was conducted to measure the occurrence of <b>stunting</b> and severe <b>stunting</b> among children aged 0 - 59 months. Additionally, we collected relevant information on anthropometric measures, dietary habits, parent and child-related demographic and socio-economic status. Latitude and longitude of surveyed households were also recorded. Local Anselin Moran's I was calculated to investigate the spatial variation of <b>stunting</b> prevalence and identify potential local pockets (hotspots) of high prevalence. Finally, we employed a Bayesian geo-statistical model, which accounted for spatial dependency structure in the data, to identify potential risk factors for <b>stunting</b> in the study area. Overall, the prevalence of <b>stunting</b> and severe <b>stunting</b> in the district was 43. 7 % [95 %CI: 40. 9, 46. 4] and 21. 3 % [95 %CI: 19. 5, 23. 3] respectively. We identified statistically significant clusters of high prevalence of <b>stunting</b> (hotspots) in the eastern part of the district and clusters of low prevalence (cold spots) in the western. We found out that the inclusion of spatial structure of the data into the Bayesian model has shown to improve the fit for <b>stunting</b> model. The Bayesian geo-statistical model indicated that the risk of <b>stunting</b> increased as the child's age increased (OR 4. 74; 95 % Bayesian credible interval [BCI]: 3. 35 - 6. 58) and among boys (OR 1. 28; 95 %BCI; 1. 12 - 1. 45). However, maternal education and household food security were found to be protective against <b>stunting</b> and severe <b>stunting.</b> <b>Stunting</b> prevalence may vary across space at different scale. For this, it's important that nutrition studies and, more importantly, control interventions take into account this spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of nutritional deficits and their underlying associated factors.

Multivariate analysis revealed that the most consistent significant risk factors for <b>stunting</b> and severe <b>stunting</b> among children aged 0 - 23 months and 0 - 59 months are: sex of child (male), mother's perceived birth size (small and average), household wealth index (poor and poorest households), duration of breastfeeding (more than 12 months), geopolitical zone (North East, North West, North Central) and children who were reported to having had diarrhoea in the 2 weeks prior to the survey [Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for <b>stunted</b> children 0 - 23 months = 1. 22 (95 %Cl: 0. 99, 1. 49) ];[AOR for <b>stunted</b> children 0 - 59 months = 1. 31 (95 %Cl: 1. 16, 1. 49) ], [AOR for severely <b>stunted</b> children 0 - 23 months = 1. 31 (95 %Cl: 1. 03, 1. 67) ]; [AOR for severely <b>stunted</b> children 0 - 59 months = 1. 58 (95 %Cl: 1. 38, 1. 82) ]. Conclusions: In order to meet the post- 2015 sustainable development goals, policy interventions to reduce <b>stunting</b> in Nigeria should focus on poverty alleviation as well as improving women's nutrition, child feeding practices and household sanitation...|$|R
40|$|Some {{of causes}} of <b>stunting</b> are the {{deferment}} of early breastfeeding initiation {{and the administration}} of the non-exclusive breastfeeding. The objective {{of this study was to}} elaborate relationship of early breastfeeding initiation and exclusive breastfeeding administration history to the <b>stunting.</b> This sudy used the observational analytical research method with the cross-sectional design. Its subjects were 33 <b>stunting</b> and 77 non-stunting children aged 6 - 24 months in Boyolali Regency. Data was analyzed by using the chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis. The <b>stunting</b> children who got the early breastfeeding initiation were 14, and those who did not get the early breastfeeding initiation were 19. The <b>stunting</b> children who got the exclusive breastfeeding were 4 and those who did not get the exclusive breastfeeding were 29. Early breastfeeding initiation and exclusive breastfeeding had a significant correlation with the <b>stunting</b> as indicated by the p-value < 0. 05. The children who did not get the early breastfeeding initiation have the possibility of 3. 69 times higher to suffer from <b>stunting</b> than those who got the early breastfeeding initiation. In addition, the children who did not get the exclusive breastfeeding have the possibility of 9. 5 times higher to suffer from <b>stunting</b> than those who got the exclusive breastfeeding. Therefore, nutrition education to the gestational mothers on the importance of exclusive breastfeeding administration is required. Penyebab masalah <b>stunting</b> antara lain akibat dari penundaan inisiasi menyusu dini (IMD), dan pemberian air susu ibu (ASI) tidak eksklusif. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis hubungan IMD dan ASI eksklusif dengan kejadian <b>stunting.</b> Penelitian observasional ini dilaksanakan di Boyolali dengan menggunakan pendekatan cross-sectional. Partisipan terdiri dari 33 anak <b>stunting</b> dan 77 anak tidak <b>stunting</b> berusia 6 - 24 bulan. Analisis data menggunakan uji chi-square dan regresi logistik berganda. Partisipan anak <b>stunting</b> yang mendapatkan IMD sebanyak 14 orang dan tidak mendapatkan IMD sebanyak 19 orang. Anak <b>stunting</b> yang mendapatkan ASI eksklusif sebanyak 4 orang dan yang tidak sebanyak 29 orang. Inisiasi menyusu dini dan ASI eksklusif memiliki hubungan yang bermakna dengan kejadian <b>stunting</b> (p< 0, 05). Anak yang tidak mendapatkan IMD memiliki kemungkinan 2, 63 (1, 02 - 6, 82) kali lebih tinggi mengalami kejadian <b>stunting,</b> selain itu anak yang tidak mendapatkan ASI eksklusif memiliki risiko mengalami kejadian <b>stunting</b> 7, 86 (2, 43 - 25, 4) kali lebih tinggi dibandingkan anak yang mendapatkan ASI eksklusif. Oleh karena itu, diperlukan edukasi gizi kepada ibu hamil mengenai pentingnya pemberian ASI eksklusif...|$|R
