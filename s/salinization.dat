5|$|The {{coastal erosion}} and <b>salinization</b> {{affecting}} {{the west of}} Senegal are also a source of concern on the island; signs of erosion have been observed in Carabane since 1849. The house of the government representative on the island has burned down twice; each time it was rebuilt, {{the site of the}} building had to be moved further and further inland. The island's erosion is evident when one considers that the original location of the house eventually became flooded, even at low tide. During the dry season the river has a tide-dominated delta, with tidewater reaching 200km upstream, while it is being concentrated 50% by evaporation.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{conservation}} is the preventing of soil loss from erosion or reduced fertility caused by over usage, acidification, <b>salinization</b> or other chemical soil contamination.|$|E
25|$|The {{responses}} {{influence the}} water and salt balances, which, in their turn, slow down the process of water logging and <b>salinization.</b> Ultimately an equilibrium situation will be brought about.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} problems in land use are soil erosion and <b>salinization</b> in improperly irrigated farmland. An estimated 60% of Kyrgyzstan's land {{is affected by}} topsoil loss, and 6% by <b>salinization,</b> both problems with more serious long-term than short-term effects. In 1994 the size of livestock herds averaged twice the carrying capacity of pasturage land, continuing the serious overgrazing problem and consequent soil erosion that began when the herds were at their peak in the late 1980s. Uncertain land tenure and overall financial insecurity have caused many private farmers to concentrate their capital in the traditional form—livestock—thus subjecting new land to the overgrazing problem.|$|E
25|$|A {{large portion}} of the soil has been {{affected}} by over salinity and it has been known to limit the growth of many plants. Globally, the total area of saline soil was 397,000,000 ha and in continents like Africa, it makes up 2 percent of the soil. The amount of soil <b>salinization</b> has reached 19.5% of the irrigated land and 2.1% of the dry-land agriculture around the world. Soil <b>salinization</b> affects the plants using osmotic potential by net solute accumulation. The osmotic pressure in the plant is what maintains water uptake and cell turgor to help with stomatal function and other cellular mechanisms. Over generations, many plant genes have adapted, allowing plants’ phenotypes to change and built different mechanisms to counter salinity effects.|$|E
25|$|When the {{discharge}} takes place by pumping, the drainage can be checked simply by not operating the pumps or {{by reducing the}} pumping time. In northwestern India, this practice has increased the irrigation efficiency and reduced the quantity of irrigation water needed, and has not led to any undue <b>salinization.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{is further}} {{contention}} {{as to whether}} saltwater encroachment that is destroying the gardens for pulaka, taro and coconut palms is the consequence {{of changes in the}} sea level; or the consequence of the fresh water being extracted from the freshwater lens in the sub-surface of the atoll or the consequence of the creation of the borrow pits, which are the result of the extraction of coral to build the runway at Funafuti during World War II. The investigation of groundwater dynamics of Fongafale Islet, Funafuti, show that tidal forcing results in salt water contamination of the surficial aquifer during spring tides. The degree of aquifer <b>salinization</b> depends on the specific topographic characteristics and the hydrologic controls in the sub-surface of the atoll. About half of Fongafale islet is reclaimed swamp that contains porous, highly permeable coral blocks that allow the tidal forcing of salt water. Increases in the sea level will exacerbate the aquifer <b>salinization</b> as the result of increases in tidal forcing.|$|E
25|$|However, one of {{the leading}} {{environmental}} organizations in Panama, the National Association for Nature Conservation (ANCON), says that the studies and projections of operations of the third set of locks, including the water-saving basins, credibly state that there will be very low levels of <b>salinization</b> of waters of Gatun Lake and that these levels will preserve the biological separation of the oceans while safekeeping biodiversity and water quality for human use.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} the <b>salinization</b> of the aquifer on Fongafale Islet {{is the result of}} both {{man-made}} changes to the topography that occurred when the air field was built in World War II by reclaiming swamp land and excavating coral rock {{from other parts of the}} islet. These topographic changes are exacerbated by the groundwater dynamics of the islet, as tidal forcing pushes salt water into the surficial aquifer during spring tides.|$|E
25|$|Groundwater {{pollution}} is a worldwide issue. A {{study of the}} groundwater quality of the principal aquifers of the United States conducted between 1991 and 2004, showed that 23% of domestic wells had contaminants at levels greater than human-health benchmarks. Another study suggested that the major groundwater pollution problems in Africa, considering the order of importance are: (1) nitrate pollution, (2) pathogenic agents, (3) organic pollution, (4) <b>salinization,</b> and (5) acid mine drainage.|$|E
25|$|Ineffective {{irrigation}} {{has generated}} <b>salinization</b> and drainage problems in 3,000 square kilometres {{of the coastal}} valleys (of a total irrigated area of 7,360km²), jeopardizing land productivity and affecting the quality of Lima's water supply. Drainage problems are also affecting 1,500km² in the Amazon region. In the highland and Amazon areas, excessive deforestation due to nomadic agriculture practices is causing erosion and soil degradation. In the Sierra 55%60% {{of the land is}} affected, increasing the amount of soil transported downstream.|$|E
25|$|Human {{activities}} {{are more likely}} to affect the habitat in areas of permanent water (oases) or where water comes close to the surface. Here, the local pressure on natural resources can be intense. The remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation. In recent years development projects have started in the deserts of Algeria and Tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers. These schemes often lead to soil degradation and <b>salinization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The type of {{desertification}} {{caused by}} year-round pasturing of cattle has been termed {{the most devastating}} in Central Asia, with the gravest situations in Turkmenistan and the Kazakh steppe along the eastern and northern coasts of the Caspian Sea. Wind erosion and desertification also are severe in settled areas along the Garagum Canal; planted windbreaks have died because of soil waterlogging and/or <b>salinization.</b> Other factors promoting desertification are the inadequacy of the collector-drainage system built in the 1950s and inappropriate application of chemicals.|$|E
25|$|About 61% of all water {{withdrawal}} in Brazil {{is used for}} irrigation, which {{is lower than the}} average {{water withdrawal}} for irrigation in Latin America, 71%. The irrigated area in 1998 was 2.8million ha, which represents 5.7% of the cultivated area. The irrigation potential of Brazil is estimated at 29.3million ha, including only areas where irrigation can be developed and excluding areas of high ecological value in the northern region (Amazonas and Tocantins basins). Ineffective irrigation has generated <b>salinization</b> and drainage problems in 15,000 ha, mostly in the northeast (of a total irrigated area of 736,000hectares), jeopardizing these lands' productivity.|$|E
25|$|Land transformation, {{the use of}} land {{to yield}} goods and services, is the most {{substantial}} way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is considered the driving force {{in the loss of}} biodiversity. Estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50%. Land degradation, the long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, is estimated to be occurring on 24% of land worldwide, with cropland overrepresented. The UN-FAO report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that 1.5 billion people rely upon the degrading land. Degradation can be deforestation, desertification, soil erosion, mineral depletion, or chemical degradation (acidification and <b>salinization).</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{irreparable}} type of desertification is the <b>salinization</b> {{process that}} forms marshy salt flats. A major factor {{that contributes to}} these conditions is inefficient use of water because of weak regulation and failure to charge for water that is used. Efficiency in application of water to the fields is low, but the main problem is leakage in main and secondary canals, especially Turkmenistan's main canal, the Karakum Canal. Nearly half of the canal's water seeps out into lakes and salt swamps along its path. Excessive irrigation brings salts to the surface, forming salt marshes that dry into unusable clay flats. In 1989 Turkmenistan's Institute for Desert Studies claimed that the area of such flats had reached 10,000km².|$|E
25|$|In villages {{where the}} only {{available}} water is from irrigation canals, water is used for domestic purposes and dumped back into the drains. Villagers drinking polluted water have been affected with kidney and liver diseases. The northeast Nile Delta region has a high incident rate of pancreatic cancer that {{is believed to be}} from high levels of heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides found in the soil and water. Exposure to cadmium may be from heavy metals and pesticides found in the water. The water exceeds the European Community Standards of fecal contamination and there is a high <b>salinization</b> and saline intrusion in the delta. Schistosomiasis has been found in irrigation canals along with benthic cyanobacteria forming mats. Microbiological contamination of water includes fecal coliform bacteria pathogens include hookworms and other intestinal helminth eggs.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{northern}} Mexico suffers {{from one of}} the world’s highest rates of desertification due to land degradation in arid and semi arid areas, with the loss of biological and/or economic productivity, but the process is most severe Sonora as neighboring Sinaloa. Land degradation occurs because of clearing land for agriculture, the planting of non-native buffelgrass for grazing, the cutting of forests, overgrazing of natural vegetation and soil <b>salinization</b> from irrigation. A study by Balling in 1998 showed higher soil and air temperatures in areas that have been overgrazed, deforested and otherwised cleared land, likely {{due to the lack of}} shading vegetation, which leads to higher soil evaporation and desert conditions. Studies have also indicated that warming trends are higher in Sonora than in neighboring Arizona, into which the Sonora Desert also extends.|$|E
25|$|Food {{availability}} {{relates to}} the supply of food through production, distribution, and exchange. Food production is determined {{by a variety of}} factors including land ownership and use; soil management; crop selection, breeding, and management; livestock breeding and management; and harvesting. Crop production can be affected by changes in rainfall and temperatures. The use of land, water, and energy to grow food often competes with other uses, which can affect food production. Land used for agriculture can be used for urbanization or lost to desertification, <b>salinization,</b> and soil erosion due to unsustainable agricultural practices. Crop production is not required for a country to achieve food security. Nations don't have to have the natural resources required to produce crops in order to achieve food security, as seen in the examples of Japan and Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{accounts}} for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources. Agriculture {{is a major}} draw on water from aquifers, and currently draws from those underground water sources at an unsustainable rate. It is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern China, the Upper Ganges and the western US are being depleted, and new research extends these problems to aquifers in Iran, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. Increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas, meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world's growing population with reduced water resources. Agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems, including the destruction of natural wetlands, the spread of water-borne diseases, and land degradation through <b>salinization</b> and waterlogging, when irrigation is performed incorrectly.|$|E
25|$|Soil management, {{or direct}} human {{interaction}} with the soil, is another mechanism of anthropogenic change studied by historical ecologists. Soil management can take place through rearranging soils, altering drainage patterns, and building large earthen formations. Consistent with the basic premises of historical ecology, it is recognized that anthropogenic soil management practices can have {{both positive and negative}} effects on local biodiversity. Some agricultural practices have led to organically and chemically impoverished soils. In the North American Midwest, industrial agriculture has led to a loss in topsoil. <b>Salinization</b> of the Euphrates River has occurred due to ancient Mesopotamian irrigation, and detrimental amounts of zinc have been deposited in the New Caliber River of Nigeria. Elsewhere, soil management practices may not have any effect on soil fertility. The iconic mounds of the Hopewell Indians built in the Ohio River valley likely served a religious or ceremonial purpose, and show little evidence of changing soil fertility in the landscape.|$|E
25|$|Environmental devastation in Uzbekistan is best {{exemplified}} by the catastrophe of the Aral Sea. Because of diversion of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya for cotton cultivation and other purposes, what once was the world's fourth largest inland sea has shrunk in {{the past thirty years}} to only about one-third of its 1960 volume and less than half its 1960 geographical size. The desiccation and <b>salinization</b> of the lake have caused extensive storms of salt and dust from the sea's dried bottom, wreaking havoc on the region's agriculture and ecosystems and on the population's health. Desertification has led to the large-scale loss of plant and animal life, loss of arable land, changed climatic conditions, depleted yields on the cultivated land that remains, and destruction of historical and cultural monuments. Every year, many tons of salts reportedly are carried as far as 800 kilometers away. Regional experts assert that salt and dust storms from the Aral Sea have raised the level of particulate matter in the Earth's atmosphere by more than 5%, seriously affecting global climate change.|$|E
25|$|Turkmenistan both {{contributes}} to and {{suffers from the}} consequences of the desiccation of the Aral Sea. Because of excessive irrigation, Turkmen agriculture {{contributes to}} the steady drawdown of sea levels. In turn, the Aral Sea's desiccation, which had shrunk that body of water by an estimated 59,000 square kilometers by 1994, profoundly affects economic productivity and the health {{of the population of the}} republic. Besides the cost of ameliorating damaged areas and the loss of at least part of the initial investment in them, <b>salinization</b> and chemicalization of land have reduced agricultural productivity in Central Asia by an estimated 20 to 25%. Poor drinking water is the main health risk posed by such environmental degradation. In Dashhowuz Province, which has suffered the greatest ecological damage from the Aral Sea's desiccation, bacteria levels in drinking water exceeded ten times the sanitary level; 70% of the population has experienced illnesses, many with hepatitis, and infant mortality is high. Experts have warned that inhabitants will have to evacuate the province by the end of the century unless a comprehensive cleanup program is undertaken. Turkmenistan has announced plans to clean up some of the Aral Sea fallout with financial support from the World Bank.|$|E
