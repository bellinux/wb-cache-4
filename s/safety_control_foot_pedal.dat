5|$|On that night, Lee maneuvered {{the small}} craft {{out to the}} anchorage. It took two hours to reach his destination, as it was hard work {{manipulating}} the hand-operated <b>controls</b> and <b>foot</b> <b>pedals</b> to propel the submersible into position. Adding to his difficulties was a fairly strong current and the darkness creeping overhead, which made visibility difficult.|$|R
50|$|The WGM.21 {{is an open}} cockpit quadrotor. Four rotors {{are mounted}} {{at the end of}} a four tubular {{supports}} arranged into a X shape. Cyclic and collective controls are mixed into a single control yoke. Pitch is <b>controlled</b> by <b>foot</b> <b>pedals.</b> A second model, the WGM.22, was developed with side-by-side configuration seating and an enclosed cockpit.|$|R

40|$|Fifty years ago, NASA {{decided that}} the cockpit {{controls}} in spacecraft should be like the ones in airplanes. But controls based on the stick and rudder may not be best way to manually control a vehicle in space. A different method is based on submersible vehicles <b>controlled</b> with <b>foot</b> <b>pedals.</b> A new pilot can learn the sub's control scheme in minutes and drive it hands-free. We are building a pair of <b>foot</b> <b>pedals</b> for spacecraft <b>control,</b> and will test them in a spacecraft flight simulator...|$|R
5000|$|A {{preselector}} or self-changing gearbox {{is a type}} {{of manual}} gearbox (US: transmission) used on a variety of vehicles, most commonly in the 1930s. The defining characteristic of a preselector gearbox is that the manual shift lever is used to [...] "pre-select" [...] the next gear to be used, then a separate <b>control</b> (a <b>foot</b> <b>pedal)</b> is used to engage this in one single operation, without needing to work a manual clutch.|$|R
50|$|With {{the guide}} rail {{automatically}} guiding the vehicle along its route, {{there are no}} steering controls in the driver's cab except for the acceleration and braking, which are <b>controlled</b> by <b>foot</b> <b>pedals.</b> Like a conventional tram, power is provided by overhead wires and collected with a pantograph, although the vehicle can also run on internal batteries (arranged in packs) in sections of the route where overhead wires are deemed to be undesirable.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{consists of}} a rigid-bottomed hull, with four independent air chambers, plus two inflatable outriggers. The trike wing is made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its single surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. The 33 ft span wing {{is supported by a}} single tube-type kingpost and uses an [...] "A" [...] frame control bar. An optional water rudder is <b>controlled</b> by <b>foot</b> <b>pedals.</b> An instrument panel is provided near the bow of the hull. The standard factory-supplied engine was the twin cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled Rotax 503 of , with the liquid-cooled Rotax 582 of [...] optional.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Taurus I was {{succeeded by}} the Taurus II, which was produced from 1981 to 1983. The Taurus II {{uses the same}} synthesis engine as a contemporary lead synthesizer, the Moog Rogue. The Taurus II was <b>controlled</b> through 18 <b>foot</b> <b>pedals,</b> modulation and pitch bend wheels, and a CV interface. The synthesizer also increased the amount of timbres and effects available. However, the Taurus II had no patch memory or <b>foot</b> <b>controls</b> apart from the pedals. Instead, the control panel was raised so that the player could manipulate it manually during performance.|$|R
5000|$|Moving frets during {{performance}} is usually impractical. The bridges of a koto, {{on the other}} hand, may be moved by the player occasionally {{in the course of}} a single piece of music. Many modern Western harps include levers, either directly moved by fingers (on Celtic harps) or <b>controlled</b> by <b>foot</b> <b>pedals</b> (on orchestral harps), to raise the pitch of individual strings by a fixed amount. The Middle Eastern zither, the qanun, is equipped with small levers called mandal that let each course of multiple strings be incrementally retuned [...] "on the fly" [...] while the instrument is being played. These levers raise or lower the pitch of the string course by a microtone, less than a half step.|$|R
50|$|A {{supplementary}} {{air supply}} <b>controlled</b> by a <b>foot</b> <b>pedal</b> operated at will by the driver provides an oil mist {{from inside the}} engine's crankcase to lubricate {{the tops of the}} valve sleeves. A three-plunger pump driven by the valve shaft forces oil from the sump to troughs under and {{in the path of the}} big ends. With each revolution the big ends dipping into the troughs throw oil to all parts of the engine. The dashboard has a telltale to warn if the pump is not working properly.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} extravagant {{controllers}} for the Densha de Go! series was the Shinkansen Controller, which was released with the Densha de Go! Shinkansen EX game for both the Wii and PS2. The Shinkansen Controller for the PS2 comes with a LED screen display of speed and <b>controls</b> and a <b>foot</b> <b>pedal</b> to blow the horn, whereas the Shinkansen Controller for the Wii lacked these features, replacing the LED screen with a representative sticker. The Wii version of this controller commands much higher prices than the PS2 version only by virtue of relative rarity.|$|R
2500|$|The Cody Floatplane was a three-bay biplane of {{orthodox}} design for an aircraft of its time, {{with a single}} elevator operated by a bamboo push-rod mounted on booms {{in front of the}} wing and a single rudder and small horizontal stabiliser on booms behind it. Lateral control was effected by wing-warping. Power was provided by a [...] Green engine mounted on the wing centre section driving a [...] diameter Garuda propeller via a chain. Pilot and passenger were seated in tandem in front of the wing, using Cody's preferred metal seats, of the type used on agricultural machinery. The arrangement of the controls was unconventional by present-day standards: all the control surfaces were operated by a control column and wheel, and the throttle and engine ignition were <b>controlled</b> using <b>foot</b> <b>pedals.</b> It was fitted with one large central float with no fewer than three steps and a pair of smaller stabilising floats positioned below the inboard interplane struts.|$|R
5000|$|Then, to {{show the}} speech {{synthesis}} ability of its decoder part, the Voder (Voice Operating Demonstrator, [...] ), {{was introduced to the}} public at the AT&T building at the 1939-1940 New York World's Fair. The Voder consisted of a switchable pair of electronic oscillator and noise generator as a sound source of pitched tone and hiss, 10-band resonator filters with variable-gain amplifiers as a vocal tract, and the manual controllers including a set of pressure-sensitive keys for filter <b>control,</b> and a <b>foot</b> <b>pedal</b> for pitch <b>control</b> of tone. The filters controlled by keys convert the tone and the hiss into vowels, consonants, and inflections. This was a complex machine to operate, but with a skilled operator could produce recognizable speech.|$|R
2500|$|Establishing a {{workshop}} at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio and working almost entirely without models or wind tunnels for testing, de Bothezat's helicopter {{was completed in}} December 1922. Featuring four six-bladed rotors {{at the end of}} massive, bridge-like girders braced with piano wire, the craft had two vertical propellers – [...] "steering airscrews" [...] – [...] for lateral control, and two additional three-bladed propellers mounted horizontally above the Le Rhône engine to provide airflow for cooling. The girders were angled such that the rotors tilted in towards the craft's center at an angle of five degrees, enhancing stability. The aircraft had two control wheels, a <b>control</b> stick, and <b>foot</b> <b>pedals</b> for <b>control,</b> with each rotor featuring variable-pitch blades for individual collective control.|$|R
5000|$|The Type Bordeaux was a two-bay equal span pusher {{configuration}} biplane {{powered by}} a Gnome Omega 7 cylinder rotary engine driving an aluminium bladed Voisin propeller mounted {{at the rear of}} the uncovered wooden nacelle. The tail surfaces, carried on four wire-braced steel booms, consisted of a horizontal stabiliser and elevator mounted between the upper pair of booms with a single centrally mounted rudder beneath it. The structure made extensive use of steel tubing and the flying surfaces were covered with [...] "Continental" [...] brand rubberised fabric. Lateral control was effected by large D-shaped ailerons mounted on the upper wing: these were <b>controlled</b> by <b>foot</b> <b>pedals.</b> The rudder and elevator were activated by a control wheel which was turned to control the rudder and moved forwards and backwards to control the elevator. It had a tricycle undercarriage consisting of a pair of mainwheels mounted on sprung steel struts below the wing and a nosewheel below the front of the nacelle, although the aircraft at rest rested on the two mainwheels and skids mounted {{at the rear of the}} lower pair of tailbooms.|$|R
5000|$|The Voder {{synthesized}} human {{speech by}} imitating {{the effects of}} the human vocal tract. The operator could select one of two basic sounds by using a wrist bar. A buzz tone generated by a relaxation oscillator produced the voiced vowels and nasal sounds, with the pitch <b>controlled</b> by a <b>foot</b> <b>pedal.</b> A hissing noise produced by a gas discharge tube created the sibilants (voiceless fricative sounds). These initial sounds were passed through a bank of 10 band pass filters that were selected by keys; their outputs were combined, amplified and fed to a loudspeaker. The filters were controlled by a set of keys and a <b>foot</b> <b>pedal</b> to convert the hisses and tones into vowels, consonants, and inflections. Additional special keys were provided to make the plosive sounds such as [...] "p" [...] or [...] "d", and the affrictive sounds of the [...] "j" [...] in [...] "jaw" [...] and the [...] "ch" [...] in [...] "cheese". This was a complex machine to operate. After months of practice, a trained operator could produce recognizable speech.|$|R
5000|$|The game POD {{is large}} and has an {{adjustable}} seat, surround sound speakers, projector screen, headset jacks(red and green), hand <b>control</b> sticks and <b>foot</b> <b>pedals.</b> Each POD is equipped with headset jacks for in-game communication between players (pilots may bring their own headsets, but forget to take them when the game is over). The pilot inserts his/her pilot card into the card slot and inserts 100 or 500-yen coins to begin gameplay. The battle scene {{point of view is}} from inside the mobile suit, the overhead projector displays three panels onto the inner dome screen about 1m away from the pilot's seat (a little longer than arm's length). Inside the pod entrance door, there is just enough space to stand another person on the side, or place a backpack or gymbag ...|$|R
30|$|The da Vinci S robotic system, {{which we}} use, is {{composed}} of three major components: a surgeon console, a patient cart, and a vision cart. The surgeon's console is the monitoring center of the system. The robotic surgeon operates from the console out of the sterile field and controls the instruments and the three-dimensional camera {{with his hands and}} feet, using two major hand <b>controls</b> and <b>foot</b> <b>pedals.</b> The apparatus for monopolar and bipolar coagulation is connected to the panel of the pedal switch (Autocon II 400, Storz). The patient cart is the operative component of the da Vinci S system. It {{is composed of}} four arms (Endo Wrist technology): three arms for controlling the surgical instruments and one arm for the camera and endoscope. The operator of the patient cart works in the sterile surgical field. The source of cold light, modules for camera control, a focus controlling mechanism, an intercom system, and a touch screen are located on the vision cart. The non-sterile person works with the appliances on the visual cart but the touch screen is dressed in a sterile cover and allows the patient-side assistant and patient-side nurse to operate with it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} uses {{a standard}} hang glider wing, made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its single surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. The wing {{is supported by}} a single tube-type kingpost and uses an [...] "A" [...] frame control bar. The engine is a two-stroke, single cylinder Radne Raket 120 of [...] that mounts a tuned exhaust, <b>controlled</b> by a <b>foot</b> <b>pedal.</b> Electric starting is provided via a 12-cell Nickel-metal hydride battery. The harness mounts the engine and the 4.6 L fuel tank. Each harness was custom made for the individual pilot to provide an exact fit and improve comfort. The harness incorporates a shaped carbon backplate, with a 10 mm foam insert, neoprene shoulder inserts, an adjustable prone angle and a multi-setting rotation point. Dual retractable cable-braced skids are provided to protect the two, or optionally three-bladed propeller, during take-off and landing.|$|R
25|$|The Model T's {{transmission}} was <b>controlled</b> {{with three}} <b>foot</b> <b>pedals</b> and a lever mounted {{to the road}} side of the driver's seat. The throttle was controlled with a lever on the steering wheel. The left pedal was used to engage the transmission. With the floor lever in either the mid position or fully forward and the pedal pressed and held forward, the car entered low gear. When held in an intermediate position, the car was in neutral. If the left pedal was released, the Model T entered high gear, but only when the lever was fully forward – in any other position, the pedal would only move up {{as far as the}} central neutral position. This allowed the car to be held in neutral while the driver cranked the engine by hand. The car could thus cruise without the driver having to press any of the pedals.|$|R
30|$|Direct {{contact between}} the {{lithotripsy}} probe and the stone was ensured by endoscopic visual monitoring. Pulse energy (0.5 - 1.0  J), frequency (one pulse mode or frequency mode) and number of pulses (quantity of pulses per pulse package) were set according to preliminarily evaluated stone density and size. Pulse release was <b>controlled</b> via a <b>foot</b> <b>pedal.</b> The probe was always {{in direct contact with}} the stone when starting a single pulse or pulse series. The probe tip was repositioned after each loss of stone contact or as determined by the physician. Lithotripsy was discontinued when fragment size was smaller than 1.5  mm as confirmed by direct endoscopic visualization or x-ray. At the end of the procedure, all patients routinely received a ureteral catheter or a stent on a case-by-case basis for 2 - 14  days. All patients underwent postoperative control observation one month following the procedure during routine visits to the clinic.|$|R

500|$|Two cars {{traverse}} the slope; as one descends, the other ascends and {{acts as a}} counterweight. The cars are [...] wide, [...] tall, and [...] long, and are large enough to carry either 65people, 6motorcycles, or an automobile. While the cars {{are open to the}} elements, an enclosed seating area containing a bench is situated along the outer side of the incline. The cables connecting the cars are , 636 right regular lay, steel wire rope. They are wound around a , [...] drum that connects the cars together. The cable on the north track is [...] long, while the south cable is [...] shorter. Each car weighs , but they, and consequently the cables, can carry an additional load of [...] A [...] electric motor turns the drum, simultaneously winding and unwinding the cable, to power the incline. The Johnstown Inclined Plane is unusual in that the motor and winch are located at a 90-degree angle to the incline instead of directly underneath it. Operation of the incline is <b>controlled</b> via a <b>foot</b> <b>pedal</b> located in a booth in the upper station.|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{prediction}} {{and understanding}} of driver speed control is important to prevent speeding behavior and design vehicle systems. Speed control is a complex behavior of driver longitudinal vehicle control, involving speed perception, decision making (setting a target speed), motor <b>control</b> (<b>foot</b> movement for <b>pedal</b> <b>control),</b> and vehicle mechanics. However, few of existing models is able to cover all of these important aspects together. To address this problem, the current work built a new mathematical driver speed control model with analytical solutions based on rigorous understanding of human cognitive mechanisms in driving, integrated Queuing Network-Model Human Processor (QN-MHP, which already modeled driver lateral control) structure and Rule-Based Decision Field Theory (RDFT), and offered a relatively complete picture of driver speed control in free-flow driving settings. This new model can provide predictions with regard to driving speed, pedal angle and acceleration for average driver. Copyright 2011 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, Inc.

40|$|International audienceThe {{coordination}} of direction {{and speed of}} self-motion when intercepting a target moving {{parallel to the ground}} plane was examined. Subjects viewed a computer-generated environment comprised of a textured ground plane and a moving target. Turning rate was controlled using a steering wheel and speed was <b>controlled</b> using a <b>foot</b> <b>pedal.</b> It was hypothesized that these two degrees of freedom would be coordinated such that the speed required to intercept the target (i. e., the ideal speed) would be maintained below the subject's maximum possible speed. As predicted, subjects turned toward the target when ideal speed was less than maximum speed and ahead of the target when ideal speed was greater than maximum speed. When behavior was compared across groups with different maximum speed capabilities, {{it was found that the}} ratio of ideal to maximum speed was invariant across groups at critical points of both steering and speed adjustments. Finally, subjects rapidly recalibrated to a sudden increase or decrease in maximum speed. The results suggest that actors coordinate steering and speed during interception in a way that takes into account the limits on their action capabilities. Discussion focuses on the role of calibration and the implications of the present findings for existing models of visually guided interception...|$|R
50|$|Pitch {{shifters}} typically {{combine the}} workings of an octaver (which adds a synthesized sound one or two octaves higher or lower than the original) sound with pitch bends and harmony shifts. The Whammy digitally produces such sounds {{in a variety of}} preset settings and <b>controlled</b> by the <b>foot</b> <b>pedal.</b> A noteworthy user of the Whammy is Tom Morello, who with Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave used the Whammy to create otherwise impossible effects. Besides Morello, Dimebag Darrell, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Jack White of The White Stripes are often mentioned as expert users. David Gilmour has been using one since his Pink Floyd song Marooned (instrumental) (The Division Bell, 1994). Noel Gallagher of Oasis has also been seen using a Whammy IV in his pedalboard for the Dig Out Your Soul tour in 2008-2009. Recently Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine is also known to use two Whammy IV pedals whIle on tour for the album MBV. The Whammy is popular among heavy metal guitarists, with guitarists such as Virus of the bands Dope and Device, and Mikey Demus of the band Skindred using it to great lengths in both their riffs and solos alike. Other users include Jimmy Page and Page Hamilton.|$|R
