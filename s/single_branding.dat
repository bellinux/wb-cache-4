As far as the customer foreclosure risks arising from <b>single</b> <b>branding</b> are concerned, it comes to the conclusion that Regulation 2790 / 1999 wrongly focuses on the market share of the seller and should concentrate on the market share of the acquirer. Symetrically, in so far as the input foreclosure risks arising from exclusive purchasing are concerned, Regulation 2790 / 1999 should focus on the market share of the seller. In the context of the upcoming review of the rules applicable to vertical agreements, the European Commission should seek to address this problem...|$|E
