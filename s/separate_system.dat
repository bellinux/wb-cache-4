40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{two related}} structures on finite sets, namely <b>separating</b> <b>systems</b> and covering <b>separating</b> <b>systems.</b> These systems are considered {{from the point}} of view of combinatorial designs. <b>Separating</b> <b>systems</b> have been considered by previous authors but this is the first time that covering <b>separating</b> <b>systems</b> have been studied in detail. A <b>separating</b> <b>system</b> on [n] = { 1, [...] ., n} is a collection of subsets of [n], in which for each pair of elements of [n), there exists a set in the collection which contains the first element but not the second or vice versa. A covering <b>separating</b> <b>system</b> on [n] is a <b>separating</b> <b>system</b> on [n] in which each element of [n] occurs at least once. A covering <b>separating</b> <b>system</b> on [n] in which each set has cardinality k is called a (n, k) covering <b>separating</b> <b>system.</b> The size of a (covering) <b>separating</b> <b>system</b> is the number of sets in the collection. The volume of at (covering) <b>separating</b> <b>system</b> is the sum of the cardinalities of the sets in the collection. A minimal (covering) <b>separating</b> <b>system</b> on [n) is one which contains the least possible number of sets. The size of a minimal <b>separating</b> <b>system</b> has been determined for all n by Renyi. The size of minimal covering <b>separating</b> <b>systems</b> on [n] and bounds or exact values on the size of a minimal (n, k) covering <b>separating</b> <b>system</b> is determined here for all n and k. Various results are derived on the volume of minimal <b>separating</b> <b>systems</b> and minimal covering <b>separating</b> <b>systems</b> on [n], and on the volume of minimal (n, k) covering <b>separating</b> <b>systems.</b> A catalogue of all non-isomorphic minimal <b>separating</b> <b>systems</b> for n ≤ 8 and all non-isomorphic minimal covering <b>separating</b> <b>systems</b> for n ≤ 7 is given. Some conjectures concerning minimal (n, k) covering <b>separating</b> <b>systems</b> are made. The thesis concludes with a brief mention of the connection between covering <b>separating</b> <b>systems</b> and finite topologies. This provides one possible avenue for applications of the theory of covering <b>separating</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

5|$|Tropical Storm Grace {{holds the}} record for being the {{farthest}} northeast forming tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin. The seventh named storm of the slightly below average 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, Grace formed from an extratropical cyclone over the Azores on October4. It strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 65mph (100km/h) and developed an eye-like feature, although cold sea surface temperatures inhibited the development of thunderstorm activity near the center. The storm lost its tropical characteristics on October 6, though the remnants merged with a <b>separate</b> <b>system</b> near the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Vamei {{weakened}} {{quickly as}} it crossed the extreme southern portion of the Malay Peninsula, and late on December 27 the JMA downgraded it to tropical depression status before the cyclone emerged into the Straits of Malacca. The JTWC initially maintained it as a minimal tropical storm, though the agency downgraded the storm to depression status as the center again approached land. Early on December 28, Vamei moved ashore along northeastern Sumatra, and at 0600UTC the JMA classified the storm as dissipated. However, convection persisted near the circulation over land, {{believed to have been}} caused by the process known as upper-level diffluence. On December 29, what was originally believed to be a <b>separate</b> <b>system</b> reached the southeastern Bay of Bengal. In a post-season re-evaluation, the JTWC classified the system as a continuation of Vamei, based on analysis of satellite imagery that indicated the circulation of Vamei crossed Sumatra without dissipating. Convection re-developed, and late on December 30 the JTWC classified the cyclone as a tropical storm about 390km (245mi) west-southwest of the northwestern tip of Sumatra; initially, due to being treated as a <b>separate</b> <b>system,</b> it was classified as Tropical Cyclone05B. Vamei quickly developed good outflow and organization, though increased wind shear on December 31 rapidly weakened the storm; by late that day, the center was exposed from the deep convection, and Vamei quickly dissipated.|$|E

5|$|Revenue {{remained}} a continual problem for Scottish government, {{even after the}} introduction of regular taxation from the 1580s, with receipts insufficient for the business of government and, after 1603, much of the costs being paid out of English revenues. In local government, attempts were made increase its effectiveness, {{with the creation of}} Justices of Peace and Commissioners of Supply. The continued existence of courts baron and introduction of kirk sessions helped consolidate the power of local lairds. In law there was an expansion of central institutions and professionalisation of lawyers as a group. Scottish law was maintained as a <b>separate</b> <b>system</b> after the union in 1707 and from 1747 the central courts gained a clear authority over local institutions.|$|E
5|$|Battles use a turn-based battle system, {{with the}} player, enemies, and {{sometimes}} non-playable characters each taking turns and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are {{won by the}} player defeating all enemies in a map or killing a boss character. Enemies include human troops and monsters. The players are given {{a limited number of}} units, which are each assigned unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class also affects their range of movement on the battlefield. In contrast to the previous game, character classes are not set but can switch once a character reaches a certain level. A special example of class promotion is the two main characters: Alm can promote from a Fighter to a Hero, while Celica promotes from a Priestess to a Princess. Each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase based on a percent chance unique for each character. Spells for magical classes are learned through leveling up rather than being part of a <b>separate</b> <b>system,</b> and each spell consumes part of the caster's health when used.|$|E

5|$|Fremantle Prison's New Division was {{constructed}} between 1904 and 1907, {{as a response}} to overcrowding. The division continues the façade alignment of the main block. The building, L shaped in plan, is three storeys high of regular coursed pale ashlar limestone blocks with rock-face. Openings are set in brick and freestone and it has a handsome lantern range above the main atrium. The building is visually significant as it complements the main cell block and completes the northern zone of the prison. The interior configuration and cells are significant as an example of an attempt to introduce the <b>separate</b> <b>system</b> to Western Australia, whereby prisoners were completely isolated for {{the first three months of}} their sentence. The division's exercise yard initially used a panopticon to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading its removal within five years.|$|E
5|$|On July1, the JTWC {{downgraded}} Tingting to {{a tropical}} storm. At 1200UTC the following day, the JMA downgraded the storm to a severe tropical storm as winds decreased below 120km/h (75mph 10-minute winds). Convection {{associated with the}} storm began to diminish as Tingting began to undergo an extratropical transition. Although the storm maintained its intensity as a severe tropical storm, it was moving into increasingly unfavorable conditions and weakening was anticipated. As Tingting tracked towards the northeast into the mid-latitude westerlies, it completed its extratropical transition on July4. After becoming an extratropical cyclone, Tingting accelerated towards the north before abruptly stalling near the Kamchatka Peninsula. On July6, the extratropical remnants of Tingting were absorbed by a developing {{area of low pressure}} located to the south of the former typhoon. However, the JMA continued to monitor Tingting as a <b>separate</b> <b>system</b> as it executed a counter-clockwise loop though July10 before heading towards the international date line. The storm was last reported on July13 to the west Aleutian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the early}} hours of September6, Nate became quasi-stationary under a weak {{steering}} pattern between Hurricane Maria and a disturbance over The Bahamas. Satellite imagery indicated that the cloud pattern continued to organize with excellent outflow surrounding the storm. Late on September6 a developing banding eye feature became evident. Tropical Storm Nate strengthened further and became a hurricane at 1200 UTCon September7, as it began to turn away from Bermuda. Some models indicated that Nate could have been either absorbed by or merged with the larger Hurricane Maria, but the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast that Nate would survive as a <b>separate</b> <b>system,</b> which it did. The large low to the northeast of The Bahamas gradually opened into a broad trough as a shortwave trough approached from the northwest. The larger trough slowly became elongated in a northeast–southwest manner late on September7. At the same time, the shortwave trough moved southward along {{the west side of the}} other trough. The increasing southwesterly flow along the southeast side of the broad trough caused Nate to accelerate northeastward. Nate reached its peak intensity of 90mph (145km/h) late on September8 as it passed 120miles (205km) southeast of Bermuda, while its strongest winds remained well offshore.|$|E
