40|$|Can one {{describe}} the ‘natural’ process of pregnancy as ‘harm’, even when negligently brought about? What does that <b>harm</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of?</b> Offering a contextual {{analysis of the}} English judiciary's characterisation of wrongful pregnancy, this paper demonstrates from a feminist perspective that the current construction of pregnancy as a ‘personal injury’ is deeply problematic. Forwarding an alternative account, this paper argues for law to embrace a richer notion of autonomy that will better resonate with women's diverse experiences of reproduction, and articulate the importance of autonomy in the reproductive domain: notably, women gaining control over their moral, relational and social lives...|$|R
40|$|Children {{can suffer}} {{developmental}} delay, or permanent damage, in their development towards an autonomous person {{but it is}} difficult for philosophical theory to explain how. The question I will focus on is how a child can be harmed and what this <b>harm</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of.</b> The general difficulty with philosophical theory about autonomy and harm is that it focusses on fully developed autonomous persons, not on not yet fully developed children. Using two exemplary cases, I will show that this can make it difficult to determine if a child is harmed and on what basis intervention is allowed to protect children from harm. This thesis will inquire into the possibilities of philosophical theory to respond to this question raised by the cases. I will analyse Joel Feinberg’s notion of soft paternalism and Richard Rorty’s work on ironism and liberalism to show that even though these theories do not answer all questions, they are able to guide me in providing possible answers...|$|R
40|$|Trust {{is vital}} yet {{vulnerable}} in economic exchange relations. In these relations, a widely used strategy {{in response to}} distributive <b>harm</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> having the transgressor pay a financial compensation to the victim. This research examines whether financial compensations can increase trust towards a transgressor, and whether {{the size of the}} compensation is relevant to this process. We hypothesized and found that whether larger compensations will elicit more trust, depends on how clear the perpetrator's intention to transgress was. Experiment 1 revealed that trust perceptions increased more by a slight overcompensation of the inflicted harm as compared to an exact or a partial compensation, but not if the transgressor's bad intentions became clear through the use of deception in the violation. In Experiments 2 and 3, we replicated these findings and further showed {{that it is not the}} use of deception per se, but rather the attribution of bad intent that moderates the effect of compensation size. Experiment 4, using a trust game paradigm revealed that this effect not only occurs for small overcompensations, but also for larger overcompensations.

50|$|Bauman's {{funeral was}} a mighty {{propaganda}} exercise. His coffin was carried {{through the streets}} of Moscow by six leather-cled 'Herculean' party members, with the coffin itself draped in scarlet pall. The procession was led by a party comrade dressed in 'Jesuitical-black', who carried a palm branch which he in time with the music and slow steps swung from side to side. Behind him, the leaders of the party followed, carrying red flags and large velvet banners carrying the 'slogans of their struggle' in gold writing, and wreaths. At their sides they were followed by an <b>'armed</b> militia' <b>consisting</b> <b>of</b> workers and students. Finally, behind these, over 100,000 mourners followed marching ten abreast in military like formation.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether there is a significant difference between workplace <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> accidents that are reported to the Department of Labour and workplace injury claims that are made to the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) that would be classed as <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> injury for the ACC Classification Unit (CU) Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale? The average number of ACC acute <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> injury claims made per year for the years 2004 - 2009 was 32. 17 (2 dp). Of these identified claims 3. 17 (9. 85 %) average per year, were reported to the Department of Labour. This result proved to be significantly different with a 99. 9 % confidence level. A reverse correlation comparing <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> accident reports submitted to the Department of Labour found the average annual number of reports for the same time period was 29. 33 (2 dp), of these reported accidents an annual average of 7. 50 (26. 05 %: annual average percentage) had a corresponding ACC injury claim; of the correlated injury claims an annual average of 4. 33 (14. 76 %: annual average percentage) would not have been classed as <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> injury claims, leaving 3. 17 (10. 81 %) <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> reports that correlated with ACC <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> injury claims. Using ACC data as the external comparison, it was shown that the ACC data for acute <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> injury claims did not correlate well with the Department of Labour <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> accident data, the monitoring authority. This indicates that many workplace <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> injuries are not being reported to the Department of Labour. Using the Department of Labour data to get a reverse correlation it was found that a degree of over reporting was occurring for the same time period, accidents were being reported that did not have a corresponding ACC injury claim...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Computer viruses have {{received}} a lot of attention. In fact, the best-known viruses have not been viruses at all, but worms, programs that spread through networks instead of modifying programs. Both viruses and worms reproduce themselves and defensive measures have focused on stopping or slowing their spread. Ultimately, though, there is no defense better than a comprehensive security strategy that embraces user education, crisis-response teams, and technologically sound security measures including, but not limited to, those that relate specifically to the threats posed by viruses and worms. Defense against <b>harm</b> can <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> preventing the <b>harm</b> from occurring, limiting the extent of the harm, or recovering from the harm after it has occurred. This research aims to resolve the confusion in identifying visualization, simulation and games in teaching malware analysis. Computer simulation has greater impact and based on research that had been carried out it is identified {{as one of the best}} approach in teaching worm analysis...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{with the}} topic of,,The Concept of <b>Serious</b> <b>Harm</b> in Refugee Law" had three basic {{objective}}s. The {{first one was}} to analyse single notions which belong {{to the concept of}} <b>serious</b> <b>harm.</b> The second objective was to compare the concept of <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> under the Qualification Directive and under the Czech Asylum Act. By means of the interpretation of single notions of <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> and the comparison of the Qualification Directive with the Czech Asylum Act, I managed to answer the question,,who is protected by Article 15 of the Qualification Directive and the second section of paragraph 14 a in the Czech Asylum Act," which was the third basic objective of this diploma thesis, {{and at the same time}} its research question. My diploma thesis is structured into 6 chapters, further it contains the list of abbreviations, the introduction, the conclusion, the list of literature, the Czech and English abstract, and key words. The first chapter deals with the evolution of the concept of <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> since the year 2001 till the contemporary version of the Qualification Directive from the year 2011, and with the incorporation of this concept into the Czech Asylum Act. From the depiction of history of the concept of <b>serious</b> <b>harm</b> in this chapter, it resulted how uneasy it was for the member states of [...] ...|$|R

6000|$|What I {{have already}} said precludes the {{necessity}} of otherwise confirming your assumption that I am opposed to the spirit you so justly characterise.[122] To your opinions upon this subject, my judgment (if I may borrow your own word) 'responds.' Providence is now trying this empire through her political institutions. Sound minds find their expediency in principles; unsound, their principles in expediency. On the proportion of these minds to each other the issue depends. From calculations of partial expediency in opposition to general principles, whether those calculations be governed by fear or presumption, nothing but mischief is to be looked for; but, in the present stage of our affairs, the class that does the most <b>harm</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> well-intentioned men, who, being ignorant of human nature, think that they may help the thorough-paced reformers and revolutionists to a certain point, then stop, and that the machine will stop with them. After all, the question is, fundamentally, one of piety and morals; of piety, as disposing men who are anxious for social improvement to wait patiently for God's good time; and of morals, as guarding them from doing evil that good may come, or thinking that any ends can be so good as to justify wrong means for attaining them. In fact, means, in the concerns of this life, are infinitely more important than ends, which are to be valued mainly according to the qualities and virtues requisite for their attainment; and the best test of an end being good is {{the purity of the}} means, which, by the laws of God and our nature, must be employed in order to secure it. Even the interests of eternity become distorted the moment they are looked at through the medium of impure means. Scarcely had I written this, when I was told by a person in the Treasury, that it is intended to carry the Reform Bill by a new creation of peers.
