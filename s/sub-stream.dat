We consider a set of single-antenna nodes with one source-destination pair and several relay nodes that transport the data of the source node to the destination node in a multihop fashion [1], [2]. In order to achieve high throughput and spectral efficiency we split the data stream into several <b>sub-streams</b> and transmit the <b>sub-streams</b> simultaneously over spatial sub-channels, whereas the sub-channels are created in a distributed fashion by the network itself (distributed spatial multiplexing). We compare two schemes: First the relays operate in an amplify-and-forward (AF) mode and establish a point-to-point MIMO channel between source and destination (MIMO tunnel). The second scheme operates with decodeand-forward (DF) relays where the <b>sub-streams</b> are transmitted over different network paths (multi-path routing). We show that the MIMO tunnel with AF relays obtains almost the performance of an idealized (interference-free) multi-path routing scheme with DF relays and is much better when interference from other routes is considered...|$|R
40|$|Stream {{fairness}}, fairness {{between all}} streams in the system, {{is a more}} restrictive condition than <b>sub-stream</b> fairness, fairness between all streams of each user. Thus <b>sub-stream</b> fairness alleviates utility loss as well as complexity and overhead compared to stream fairness. Moreover, depending on algorithmic parameters, conventional algorithms including distributed interference alignment (DIA) may not provide <b>sub-stream</b> fairness, and generate sub-streams with poor signal-to-interference plus noise ratios (SINRs), thus with poor bit error rates (BERs). To this end, we propose a distributed power control algorithm to render <b>sub-stream</b> fairness in the system, and establish initiatory connections between <b>sub-stream</b> SINRs, BERs, and rates. Algorithms have particular responses to parameters. In the paper, important algorithmic parameters are analyzed to exhibit numerical correctness in benchmarking. The distinction between separate filtering schemes that design each stream of a user separately and group filtering schemes that jointly design the streams of a user is also underscored in the paper. Finally, the power control law used in the proposed algorithm is proven to linearly converge to a unique fixed-point, and the algorithm is shown to achieve feasible SINR targets.

The Walsh-code modulator {{consists of a}} dynamic demultiplexer and predetermined sets of orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard codes. The demultiplexer can demultiplex the input bit stream into a maximum of thirty-two <b>sub-streams.</b> The Walsh- Hadamard codes are used to spread the spectrum of the demultiplexed <b>sub-streams.</b> The Walsh-code modulator produces a multi-level pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) signal by summing the spread <b>sub-streams.</b> The number of levels contained in the constellation of the PAM signal varies, {{based on the number}} of demultiplexed substreams. The error rate performance of different constellations produced by the Walsh-code modulator, differ when transmitted through a Rayleigh fading plus additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. As the level of fading experienced in the channel fluctuates, a desired level of error rate performance can be maintained by switching constellations, while trying to use the maximum number of <b>sub-streams,</b> or links, to transmit the data. Simulation results show the performance of several constellations when transmitted through an AWGN channel and a Rayleigh fading plus AWGN channel. Also, mapping of the PAM signal onto a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation, in order to improve the performance of the system is discussed. It is found that for a Rayleigh fading plus AWGN channel, at a given error performance level, the amount of gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), from the largest constellation to the smallest constellation, is 8 dB for the symbol error rate (SER) and 14 dB for the bit error rate (BER) ...|$|R

The motivation is that the reliability of data decision increases with increasing magnitude of LLR. As a result, the error propagation associated with a wrong decision and the resulting error probability for the remaining <b>sub-streams</b> can be minimized. It is shown that the proposed LLR-based ordering significantly outperforms the conventional SNR-based ordering.

The acclaimed SINR maximization (max-SINR) algorithm does not achieve fairness between user's streams, i. e., <b>sub-stream</b> fairness is not achieved. To this end, we propose a distributed power control algorithm to render <b>sub-stream</b> fairness in the system. <b>Sub-stream</b> fairness is a less restrictive design metric than stream fairness (i. e., fairness between all streams) thus sum-rate degradation is milder. Algorithmic parameters can significantly differentiate the results of numerical algorithms. A complete picture for comparison of algorithms can only be depicted by varying these parameters. For example, a predetermined iteration number or a negligible increment in the sum-rate can be the stopping criteria of an algorithm. While the distributed interference alignment (DIA) can reasonably achieve <b>sub-stream</b> fairness for the later, the imbalance between sub-streams increases as the preset iteration number decreases.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of the demand on video {{streaming}} services, Internet has witnessed the great success of the Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) live streaming systems. In the past several years, P 2 P live streaming architectures have advanced in two major approaches: pull-based approach versus tree-based (push-based) approach. Since they both have inherent performance limitations, recently, researchers are exploring a new class of streaming architecture, called the pull-push hybrid approach. In this work, we thoroughly study this new type of P 2 P live streaming architecture including models, algorithms and implementations. The <b>sub-stream</b> scheduling problem is the key design issue in a P 2 P hybrid live streaming system. In this work, we propose a max-flow model for unifying this <b>sub-stream</b> scheduling problem. We find that the <b>sub-stream</b> scheduling problem in CoolStreaming+, GridMedia and LStreaming can be formulated into a special case of the proposed max-flow model. We demonstrate that the <b>sub-stream</b> scheduling module in these three hybrid systems actually solves one special case of the proposed max-flow model, respectively. Our proposed max-flow model can be solved in polynomial time and provides useful insights for a better <b>sub-stream</b> scheduling design, in which we propose a weighted max-flow scheduling scheme to better utilize heterogeneous peers. In large-scale P 2 P networks, since participating peers reside behind different ISPs and use various methods to access the network, the networks always have apparent peer heterogeneity issue in terms of the upload bandwidth. Recently, the layered coding has become a viable and promising way to deliver real-time streaming traffic. However, existing layered streaming systems all adopt the pull-based streaming architecture, and the strength of the layered coding is not brought into full play in these systems. In the thesis, we point out the benefits of combining the hybrid architecture and the layered coding together, and demonstrate how to conduct the <b>sub-stream</b> scheduling in the layered streaming case, with the consideration of the layer dependency requirement.
