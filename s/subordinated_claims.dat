If anything, he seems even more right today in a media environment that continues to become more cluttered. In this article, we investigate the role that memory plays {{in the development of}} beliefs within this context and focus on the formation of beliefs that develop with little intention or opportunity to learn. Following on previous work, we investigate the effect of repetition-induced increases in be-lief for advertising claims that are hierarchically related: a superordinate general benefit claim (e. g., security of a lock) and multiple <b>subordinate</b> feature <b>claims</b> (e. g., pick resistant and profes-sional installation required). We find that beliefs in feature claims increase monotonically with number of exposures, although at a diminishing marginal rate. We find no evidence of horizontal spillover of repetition-induced increases in belief from one <b>subordinate</b> feature <b>claim</b> to another. However, we find a substantial amount of vertical spillover of repetition-induced increases in be-lief from individual <b>subordinate</b> feature <b>claims</b> to the superordinate general benefit. A dual media-tion analysis suggests that the vertical spillover comes from both an increase in familiarity of the general benefit and greater belief in the set of <b>subordinate</b> feature <b>claims...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{a model of}} the optimal {{financial}} claim for a bank in a world where a borrowing firm’s uninformed stakeholders depend upon the bank for truthful information about the firm’s evolving financial condition. In particular, stakeholders rely upon the bank to reveal whether the borrowing firm is truly financially distressed and whether concession by stakeholders are necessary. The bank’s financial claim is designed to ensure that it cannot form a coalition with the firm’s owners either to seek unnecessary concession when the firm is actually healthy, or to claim that the firm is healthy when it is actually in distress. We show that the optimal chain has the following characteristics. To ensure that a healthy firm/bank coalition will not form to seek unnecessary concessions from stakeholders, the bank must keep its equity stake in a distressed firm below a ceiling level. To ensure that a distressed firm/bank coalition will not falsely claim that the firm is healthy, a sufficiently large portion of the bank’s financial claim on the healthy firm must be <b>subordinated</b> to stakeholders’ <b>claims.</b> Since banks may have difficulty in credibly <b>subordinating</b> their debt <b>claims,</b> a bank equity stake in the healthy firm may be necessary. Thus, our analysis offers limited support for the argument that bank equity stakes in borrowing firms may enhance banks’ ability to reduce the costs of financial distress for borrowing firms. ...|$|R

40|$|Confidential {{preliminary}} draft—Do not forward without author’s permission 1 Secret liens and {{the financial}} crisis of 2008 By Michael Simkovic This article explains the roots of financial crises {{in one of the}} oldest and most fundamental problems of commercial law: hidden leverage. Common law courts wrestled with this problem for centuries and developed a time-tested solution: the doctrine of secret liens. If the debtor becomes insolvent, the doctrine of secret liens punishes secret lien holders by <b>subordinating</b> their <b>claims</b> to those of other creditors. In other words, by overriding privately negotiated payment priorities, the doctrine of secret liens creates incentives for transparency. This article argues that legal changes over the last 80 years eroded the doctrine of secret liens, and thereby led to the financial crisis. Due to these legal changes, complex and opaque financial products received the highest priority in bankruptcy, and creditors' incentives were therefore to structure transactions using these favored financial products. The opaque credit environment that resulted permitted debtors-particularly investment banks-to hide the extent of their leverage, to the detriment of all creditors. This article argues that Congress can prevent futur...|$|R
40|$|Subordination {{agreements}} among creditors {{are common}} in financial transactions. When a company seeks additional credit, the new lender may insist on an agreement with existing creditors which provides that their right to payment will be subordinated to the full payment of the new loan. The existing creditors {{may be willing to}} sign such an agreement for the purpose of encouraging the new lender to provide the borrower with liquidity needed to continue the business as a profitable venture, thereby increasing the likelihood that the borrower will meet all future financial obligations. In addition, contractual subordination is used frequently in connection with the issuance of debt securities. The level of priority of the debt securities, whether senior or junior, will directly affect their interest rate and market price. In general, contractual subordination will be respected in the event the borrower becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy case. Section 510 (a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that “[a] subordination agreement is enforceable in a case under this title to the same extent that such agreement is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law. ” Unless a bankruptcy court rearranges priorities based on equitable principles, known as equitable subordination, or the class of senior creditors effectively waives the benefits of the subordination agreement by voting to accept a chapter 11 plan in which they give up their rights to junior creditors, the subordination agreement controls the ranking of prebankruptcy claims against the bankruptcy estate. In addition to using subordination agreements to achieve priority over other creditors with respect to the payment of their claims, senior creditors also use them to obtain other rights from junior creditors. In particular, subordination agreements have included provisions that give the senior creditor the right to cast the junior creditor 2 ̆ 7 s vote to either accept or reject a plan of reorganization in the event the borrower is in chapter 11. These provisions effectively give a senior creditor two votes; it may vote with respect to its own claim and may vote again with respect to the <b>subordinated</b> <b>claim.</b> Senior creditors have argued that these provisions should be enforceable as a matter of contract, but junior creditors, wishing to vote on a chapter 11 plan despite the contractual provision, have argued that the enforcement of these provisions would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code granting voting rights only to the holders of claims. This article will examine how courts have dealt with these voting rights provisions found in subordination agreements...|$|R
