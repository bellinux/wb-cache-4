5000|$|Labour supply curves {{derive from}} the 'labour-leisure' trade-off. More hours worked earn higher incomes, but necessitate {{a cut in the}} amount of leisure that workers enjoy. Consequently, there are two effects on the amount of labour desired to be <b>supplied</b> <b>due</b> to a change in the real wage rate. As, for example, the real wage rate rises the {{opportunity}} cost of leisure increases. This tends to make workers supply more labour (the [...] "substitution effect"). However, also as the real wage rate rises, workers earn a higher income for a given number of hours. If leisure is a normal good—the demand for it increases as income increases—this increase in income tends to make workers supply less labour so they can [...] "spend" [...] the higher income on leisure (the [...] "income effect"). If the substitution effect is stronger than the income effect then the labour supply slopes upward. If, beyond a certain wage rate, the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect, then the labour supply curve bends backward. Individual labor supply curves can be aggregated to derive the total labour supply of an economy.|$|E

Wilson, arrived to provide the Arabs rifles, explosives, mortars, and machine guns. Artillery was only sporadically <b>supplied</b> <b>due</b> to a general shortage, though Faisal would have several batteries of mountain guns under French Captain Pisani and his Algerians for the Megiddo Campaign. [...] Egyptian and Indian troops also served with the Revolt, primarily as machine gunners and specialist troops, a number of armoured cars were allocated for use. [...] The Royal Flying Corps often supported the Arab operations, and the Imperial Camel Corps served with the Arabs for a time. [...] The French military mission of 1,100 officers under Brémond established good relations with Hussein and especially with his sons, the Emirs Ali and Abdullah, and for this reason, most of the French effort went into assisting the Arab Southern Army commanded by the Emir Ali that was laying siege to Medina and the Eastern Army commanded by Abdullah that had the responsibility of protecting Ali's eastern flank from Ibn Rashid. Medina was never taken by the Hashemite forces, and the Ottoman commander, Fakhri Pasha, only surrendered Medina when ordered to by the Turkish government on January 9, 1919. The total number of Ottoman troops bottled up in Medina by {{the time of}} the surrender were 456 officers and 9,364 soldiers.|$|E

40|$|The author finds {{evidence}} of a downward-sloping labor supply curve for urban areas in Peru from cross-sectional household data for 2002 and pooled data for available years from 1985 to 2000. Individuals respond to lower hourly earnings {{with an increase in}} the quantity supplied of work hours. This behavior would help to explain the increasing trend in average work hours in Peru (this average for male workers in Lima, the capital city, rose from 50. 5 to 53. 9 weekly hours between 1985 and 2000; meanwhile, 33. 4 % of workers had weekly schedules above 60 hours in 2002).

40|$|Wind {{energy is}} a propitious {{alternative}} to fossil-fuel generation {{due to its}} benign environmental footprint and sustainability. However, the intermittent nature of wind turbine output may scale up the risk of not meeting current or future load demand. A quantitative risk measure associated with introducing wind turbines into the generation eet is investigated in this paper. Due to the randomness of the wind speed profile, a common wind speed model employing a multistate wind generation pattern, representing various production levels, was adopted, as opposed to conventional generator models, which are suitably represented with a two-state model. Using a hybrid method that combines the analytical technique with Monte Carlo simulation, risk measures such as loss of load probability were evaluated and applied to the RBTS and IEEE-RTS test systems. The expected demand not <b>supplied,</b> <b>due</b> to contemplated uncertainties, was further quantified. Test {{results show that the}} capacity credit of wind turbine generators could vary widely depending on system size and configuration. Furthermore, the use of an 11 -state wind representation model along with the normal distribution of wind speed produces very close results compared with the Weibull distribution of wind speed...|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} that each {{engineering}} assembly product has A,B and C class components which together comprises assembly. A class component has high contribution in product function, cost and profitability {{of the engineering}} enterprise. A special technical research is must for this class of components. Product assembly is another crucial function where all failures are coming on the surface. Where all components are to be available simultaneously to complete assembly. This is important stage because if component supply is interrupted assembly function stops. Many times the components cannot be <b>supplied</b> <b>due</b> to selection and use of traditional manufacturing techniques used {{at the time of}} sample lot submission. These short cuts taken during development phase are becoming hurdles at the time of commercial or bulk production of assembly. Selection of most suitable and advance techniques for manufacturing of all components gives quality and quantity of all components and streamlines assembly functions. Keen approach towards manufacturing techniques eliminates quality and productivity problems which occur at the supply stage of the product. This also derives long term benefits such as customer satisfaction gain, product life cycle growth...|$|E
40|$|The Antarctic {{ozone hole}} will {{continue}} to be observed in the next 35 - 50 years, although the emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have gradually been phased out during the last two decades. In this paper, we suggest a geo-engineering approach that will remove substantial amounts of hydrogen chloride (HCl) from the lower stratosphere in fall, and hence limit the formation of the Antarctic ozone hole in late winter and early spring. HCl will be removed by ice from the atmosphere at temperatures higher than the threshold under which polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) are formed if sufficiently large amounts of ice are supplied to produce water saturation. A detailed chemical-climate numerical model is used to assess the expected efficiency of the proposed geo-engineering method, and specifically to calculate the removal of HCl by ice particles. The size of ice particles appears to be a key parameter: larger particles (with a radius between 10 and 100 mu m) appear to be most efficient for removing HCl. Sensitivity studies lead to the conclusions that the ozone recovery is effective when ice particles are supplied during May and June in the latitude band ranging from 70 degrees S to 90 degrees S and in the altitude layer ranging from 10 to 26 km. It appears, therefore, that supplying ice particles to the Antarctic lower stratosphere could be effective in reducing the depth of the ozone hole. In addition, photodegradation of CFCs might be accelerated when ice is <b>supplied</b> <b>due</b> to enhanced vertical transport of this efficient greenhouse gas...|$|E

40|$|The {{exponential}} decreases with {{depth of}} 10 Be, 230 Th and 231 Pa in two manganese nodules {{from the central}} North Pacific is interpreted in terms of slow growth of the nodules: at average rates of millimeters per million years. It is observed in one specimen (Mn 139) : 10 Be-based rate 230 Th-based rate < 231 Pa-based rate. This suggests that diffusion-mixing may have modified the depth gradients of these nuclides, such that the true rate would be close to or even lower than the observed 10 Be rate of 1. 3 mm/ 10 - 6 yr. Quantitative assessment using a diffusion-decay model indicates that in Mn 139, 230 Th and 231 Pa could {{have been subjected to}} diffusion-like transport with an effective diffusion coefficient of about 1 10 power 8 xcm- 2 /yr. After correction for this effect, the 230 Th and 231 Pa data give a concordant rate of 1. 9 mm/ 10 - 6 yr, about 2 - 3 times lower than their uncorrected values. The small and variable amounts of integrated dpm/cmSUP- 2 of 10 Be, 230 Th excess and 231 Pa excess found in nodules are best explained by their incorporating {{only a fraction of the}} nuclides <b>supplied</b> <b>due</b> to frequent coverage of sediments. The alternative explanation of young 'exposure' ages is refutable on several grounds. Among these, it is shown that diffusion of nuclides required by the exposure-age concept yields depth profiles that are not of the commonly observed exponential form...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. The {{structural}} and functional {{changes in the}} RA foot often affect the patient’s gait and mobility, impacting on the patient’s quality of life. Successful management of these foot pathologies and resultant problems can involve the provision of specialist therapeutic footwear. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the value of a new footwear design based on patients’ opinions compared with a traditional footwear design. Method. A total of 80 patients with RA of 5 yrs or more duration, foot deformity, difficulty in being able to obtain suitable retail footwear and self-reported foot pain were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (new design) or the control group (traditional design). Patients completed two specific health-related quality of life scales (Foot Health Status Questionnaire and the Foot Function Index) at baseline and after 12 weeks. Results. Only 36 patients completed the trial. Ten refused the footwear outright and 34 withdrew from the study after the footwear was <b>supplied,</b> <b>due</b> to either non-footwear related problems or reasons related to the footwear. Both the specific health related quality of life scales demonstrated significant improvement from baseline to week 12 with the intervention group (P 0. 05). Conclusions. Improvement in pain and patient satisfaction with the new design of footwear for patients with RA over the traditional design indicates the importance of patient involvement in the design process and throughout the process of supplying and monitoring the footwear. The fact that the new-design shoe was based on patients’ involvement in the design process in a previous study may be the most important factor in its success. In order to meet the clinical goals of this footwear the patients need to wear them, and to achieve this the patients’ requirements need to be acknowledged...|$|E
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the load {{duration}} curves used for development studies on the sub-transmission grid. The aims of grid development studies are firstly to locate the needs for grid reinforcement, then to elaborate a reinforcement strategy and finally to promote the profitability of this reinforcement. This study is about the last step of grid development studies: benefits calculation. The profitability of grid development studies is estimated by comparing grid investment costs and failure costs modelled by the energy not supplied. Load duration curves are {{used to calculate the}} energy not <b>supplied</b> <b>due</b> to transmission limitations and therefore to promote the profitability of grid developments (new transmission facilities…). Current load duration curves come from a catalogue created in the early nineties which identifies nine consumption profiles. The aim {{of this study was to}} decide whether this catalogue is still valid or not, and, if this catalogue is no longer valid, to elaborate a new catalogue or a homemade software to create on demand, i. e. “à la carte”, load duration curves or load curves for every studied area. Firstly, current catalogue relevance has been analyzed through comparisons with real measured load duration curves of fourteen areas which showed its inadequacy. Then, the study of the real measured load duration curves proved that an accurate catalogue including all the existing load profiles would require a huge number of parameters to describe it. Therefore, a new simple catalogue could be enough to model load profiles on large areas for large scale studies but not for local studies. For these last ones, on demand load duration curves would be preferred to have an appropriate detailed and realistic description of local load behaviour. Finally, a simple method and software to create load duration curves or load curves for every studied area has been developed. Through this analysis, questions were raised of which some could not be answered and this method is not applicable right now. The study needs to be widened in order to establish the links with load levels forecast...|$|E

40|$|Recognition of {{the need}} to {{effectively}} develop and deploy new capability within large BAE SYSTEMS projects has lead to the development of several lifecycle management processes. Many of these processes are generic and open to interpretation, or large and unwieldy. The Capability Development and Deployment Process (COOP) evolved to amalgamate many of these mandatory lifecycIe processes but in doing so became a large complex business process in itself with issues regarding representation, usability and decision making. The hypothesis of this thesis is that a Decision Support System (DSS) could be developed to resolve issues of representation, usability and decision making associated with large complex business processes such as the CDDP. In proving the hypothesis, a 'proof of concept' DSS has been developed and evaluated from 'personal', 'technical' and 'organisational' perspectives as a tool for use by managers that reduces the apparent complexity of the CDDP, bridges islands of knowledge, alleviates bias and misconception, and facilitates the progression of a new capability through development to deployment. Key {{to the success of the}} 'proof of concept' DSS was the research methodology and design approach taken, which involved the selection and implementation of appropriate tools and techniques. This included the development of a standardised version of the CDDP using IDEFO modelling format, the development and utilisation of a Bayesian Belief Network in a novel approach to decision support for project maturity, and the development of a graphical user interface to remove the user from the complexity of the CDDP, aid navigation through the process and provide multiple cues to aid decision support. The original paper based version of the CDDP along with the equivalent IDEFO representations are provided on the CD accompanying this thesis. A complete version of the 'proof of concept' Decision Support System could not be <b>supplied</b> <b>due</b> to licensing restriction of the commercialoff- the-shelf (COTS) tools embedded within the application (Systems Architect and Netica).

40|$|In {{high density}} urban {{areas where the}} land {{acquisition}} and construction cost components are significant relative to total development costs, the market typically supplies a high-income housing product {{in order to justify}} the risks for new construction. In places such as New York, Tokyo, London and other land supply restricted cities, the effect of these rising costs has forced the unsubsidized middle-class to migrate further and further {{from the center of the}} city where most of the infrastructural area amenities and jobs are located. This causes extended commuting times that result in the exacerbation of pollution and wasted allocation of resources. In effect, the overall function of the city grows more inefficient. All the while, the demographic texture of the central city becomes a polarized gathering of the wealthy elite and the service oriented subsidized poor. The lack of income diversity results in a spatial built form that also mimics this polarized condition. In these circumstances, might there be a strategy for encouraging a housing prototype that specifically targets the broad middle class market in order for cities to maintain diverse communities, a tapestry of spatial form, and a more efficient competitive city. The hypothesis is that if housing occupancy levels can be doubled from what is currently allowed within spaces that are tighter than typical American standards, then middle-income affordability can be achieved without diminishing design quality. This thesis investigates what flexible spatial possibilities there may be for middle-income housing based on a series of design priorities that are underpinned with an approach that advocates for a more intense occupancy use per unit of housing. Due to the augmented use intensity, flexibly designed elements are built within the spatial form of each unit. Each design variation is subsequently tested against a private sector based feedback mechanism that measures the affordability range that the design can offer. This iterative tool reveals what income groups can be <b>supplied</b> <b>due</b> to the design changes put forth by the varying design priorities. It is the hope that this tool will enable architects, developers, and the capital markets to understand the trade-offs made from both a spatial form perspective as well as a market perspective in order to ultimately enhance the condition of the built environment. by Ryunosuke Konishi.
