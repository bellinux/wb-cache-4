40|$|The {{interplay between}} {{banks and the}} {{macroeconomy}} is of key importance for financial and economic stability. We analyze this link using a Factor Augmented Vector Autoregressive Model (FAVAR) which extends a standard VAR for the U. S. macroeconomy {{with a set of}} factors summarizing conditions in the banking sector. We use the model to analyze bank risk, bank returns, and bank lending. We take data of more than 2, 000 commercial banks from the U. S. Call Reports. We assess the importance of common versus idiosyncratic risk at the bank level and the heterogeneous transmission of macroeconomic and asset price shocks to individual banks. Our paper has four main findings. First, average bank risk declines following expansionary shocks. Results for individual banks reveal that 1 / 3 of all banks increase risk after a monetary loosening. In this sense, our results are partly in support of the risk-taking channel. Second, bank lending increases following expansionary shocks. Third, the correlation between bank risk and return depends on the underlying macroeconomic shock. Fourth, banks' responses to macroeconomic shocks exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity. We find that riskiness and internationalization are determinants of banks' risk and <b>lending</b> <b>exposure</b> to monetary policy shocks, and that liquidity, in addition, determines banks' <b>lending</b> <b>exposure...</b>|$|R

The second chapter studies how professional connections between firm and bank influence their banking relationships. Particularly, {{by focusing on the}} directors’ past employment with firms or banks, the study verifies that connections lower the information barrier and facilitate the transfer of firm-specific information. The third chapter is motivated by an exogenous shock to the CDS market called “small bang”. Exploiting lending and CDS data at firm-bank level, the study examines how changes in CDS positions as well as newly commenced CDS trading between a firm and bank increased bank’s <b>lending</b> <b>exposures</b> to the referenced firms. The last chapter introduces a still-overlooked element, the number of industries the firm operates in, to the wide and on-going empirical investigation on firm-bank relationships. Estimating a three-stage selection model, the results show that a higher number of industries the firm operates in corresponds to a higher likelihood of relationship multiplicity and a higher number of bank relationships. The dissertation introduces less-investigated elements to the relationship banking literature. By looking at how these elements play a role in firm-bank relationships, the dissertation confirms the effect of relationship banking as a method to reduce information asymmetry and monitor firm risks...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the understanding of the relatively poor performance of banks and the depressed credit supply since the 2007 - 2009 crisis. In chapter 1, I study the role of securitisation in bank lending. I compare banks with and without access to securitisation and exploit the crash in the market for securitised products in 2007 as a shock to the ability to securitise. My results show that securitisation is associated with enhanced credit supply and lower dependence on capital in lending, giving rise to a capital relief channel. Furthermore, I find evidence that banks use unlocked capital from the securitisation of consumer and residential credit to propel commercial lending, suggesting spill-over effects. I document that since the market crash in late 2007 and even more so after the crisis when tighter regulations kicked in, the credit supply enhancing effects of securitisation have evaporated. In chapter 2, I study the impact of post-crisis stress testing on banking. CCAR is an extremely far-reaching and costly annual stress testing exercise whose outcome directly impacts banks' capital distributions. Bank executives name CCAR as one of the main culprits for poor performance and lower credit supply. I exploit cross-sectional variation in compliance to isolate the impact of CCAR. My results confirm that participating in CCAR is associated with significantly lower profitability and that banks shed high risk-weighted assets including large <b>lending</b> <b>exposures</b> to comply with elevated CCAR-capital requirements. In chapter 3, I study the stock market response to enhanced prudential standards (EPST). I find that immediate price adjustments reflect that investors perceived EPST as relatively good news. In the longer-term, I document that stocks of banks affected by EPST strongly outperform otherwise comparable bank stocks. This outperformance suggests a prolonged learning period of investors to evaluate the impact of EPST on banks' financial performances. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of Basel ll on the South African banking system through possible changes in the way in which a bank conducts its business. This purpose arose from the publication of the new Basel ll Framework on 26 June 2004, which has been adopted for implementation by the South African Reserve Bank. South Africa has set January 1, 2008 as the implementation date for Basel ll. The South African banks have mainly been focussing their efforts on becoming Basel ll compliant. Business line management and marketers have up until now not paid much attention to the likely impact of Basel ll on their markets and product offerings. A literature study was undertaken which included a review of the Basel ll Framework, impact studies and a review of the relevant literature on the topic. The Framework was analysed in order to determine the major impact themes. Once these impact themes were identified, the literature on those areas of impact was researched. The analysis of the Basel ll Framework identified three important themes that will have a significant impact on banks. There will firstly be an impact on market segments and product offerings. Secondly, there will be an internal impact on the banks in the form of increased costs, decision-making and capital management. The final theme identified was the global impact on the banks, especially regarding procyclicality and mergers and acquisitions. vii The research indicates that there will be both winners and losers. Banks that have large retail and mortgage exposures will benefit the most from Basel ll, whereas banks that have large exposures to sovereigns, banks and <b>specialised</b> <b>lending</b> portfolios will be negatively impacted. A capital charge for operational risk will mean that some areas such as corporate finance and asset management will be allocated capital, which was not the case under Basel l. Studies indicate that this new operational risk capital requirement more than outweighs any reduction in credit risk capital requirements. Customers that have high credit ratings are more likely to benefit from lower credit spreads. Similarly customers that have poor credit ratings can expect an increase in their pricing due to the higher capital requirements for these customers, unless they can provide a bank with ancillary revenues. Competition in the retail and mortgage markets will intensify due to the favourable capital requirements for these portfolios. The large South African banks will become takeover targets because of their large exposures to these markets. Basel ll will have a major impact on the way in which banks will do business in the future and as a result banks should view the implementation of the Framework as an opportunity to gain strategic advantages rather than just a compliance obligation.

40|$|Concern {{about the}} {{neurotoxicity}} of lead, particularly in infants and young children, {{has led to}} a revision of blood lead levels which are considered to involve an acceptable level of human exposure. Drinking water guidelines have also been reviewed in order to reduce this source of population exposure to lead. In the last 20 years, guidelines have been reduced from 100 to 50 to 10 mu g/litre. Lead in tap water used to be a major public health problem in Glasgow because of the high prevalence of houses with lead service pipes, the low pH of the public water supply and the resulting high levels of lead in water used for public consumption. Following two separate programmes of water treatment, involving the addition of lime and, a decade later, lime supplemented with orthophosphate, it is considered that maximal measures have been taken to reduce lead exposure by chemical treatment of the water supply. Any residual problem of public exposure would require large scale replacement of lead service pipes. In anticipation of the more stringent limits for lead in drinking water, we set out to measure current lead exposure From tap water in the population of Glasgow served by the Loch Katrine water supply. to compare the current situation with 12 years previously and to assess the public health implications of different limits. The study was based on mothers of young children since maternal blood lead concentrations and the domestic water that mothers use to prepare bottle feeds are the principal sources of foetal and infant lead exposure. An estimated 17 % of mothers lived in households with tap water lead concentrations of 10 mu g/litre (the WHO guideline) or above in 1993 compared with 49 % in 1981. Mean maternal blood lead concentrations fell by 69 % in 12 years. For a given water lead concentration, maternal blood lead concentrations were 67 % lower. The mean maternal blood lead concentration was 3. 7 mu g/litre in the population at large, compared with 3. 3 mu g/litre in households with negligible or absent tap water lead. Nevertheless, between 63 % and 76 % of cases of mothers with blood lead concentrations of 10 mu g/dl or above were attributable to tap water lead. The study found that maternal blood lead concentrations were well within limits currently considered safe for human health. About 15 % of infants may be exposed via bottle feeds to tap water lead concentrations that exceed the WHO guideline of 10 mu g/litre. In the context of the health and social problems which affect the well-being and development of infants and children in Glasgow, however, current levels of <b>lend</b> <b>exposure</b> are considered to present a relatively minor health problem.

40|$|Housing market {{dynamics}} {{and in particular}} the recent decline in house price trends are issues that have drawn international attention due to widespread ramifications for the economy through <b>lending</b> practices, <b>exposure</b> to risk and the associated impact on manufacturing and service industries. This has lead economists to consider the level of influence that collective behaviour of homeowners decision making can have on demand for property and residential property prices. This presents a challenge to existing econometric models that are built on fundamental economic factors influencing prices as the dynamics of behaviour are not explicitly considered. Northern Ireland experienced unprecedented rapid price growth (2005 - 2007) followed by a period of sharp decline (2008 - 2009). The housing market is almost exclusively traded through a process of negotiated sale in the open market which provides a case study for vendor and buyer interactions. The dataset for this research contains 3124 detailed transaction histories for properties sold in the Belfast Metropolitan Area, the largest residential market in Northern Ireland, between January 2002 and December 2009 facilitating investigation of housing market dynamics through analyzing trends of actual bidding histories. The effects of vendor and bidder behaviour in a rising and a falling market on time on the market and sales price relative to list price are analysed. Time to first bid is advocated as an alternative measure to time on the market. The research analyses the fundamental differences between single bidder and multiple bidder sales in terms of price discovery and risk and the effects of the number of bidders on time on the market and price. Evidence for different list price strategies and bidding strategies in rising market and falling markets is presented with concentrations of extreme bidding behaviour and loss aversion.

Methods Pregnant CD 1 mice were exposed to continuous levels of CO (0 to 400 ppm) from conception to gestation day 17. The effect on fetal/placental growth and development, and fetal/maternal CO concentrations were determined.

40|$|In {{reviewing}} {{what happened}} in the 1980 s in Japan and how the bursting of the bubble created problems in the early 1990 s, the following conclusions are obtained. (1) In order to limit damage to the economy from a bubble and its bursting, it is important to build a resilient financial system through strict supervision policy, so that asset-price fluctuations would not weaken financial institutions. Supervision policy would include regulatory measures limiting <b>lending</b> concentration and <b>exposure</b> to real-estate-related sectors. (2) Monetary policy should pay attention to asset-price movements. But it may be difficult and inappropriate to raise the interest rate sharply when inflation is low (below one per cent like in Japan), even though asset prices are increasing at 30 - 40 per cent. (3) The official discount rate could have been raised in the summer of 1988 in Japan, when the Federal Reserve and Bundesbank raised interest rates. This would have slowed down the rise of stock and land prices, but the bubble was already large by then. (4) The bubble {{in the second half of}} the 1980 s was only partially responsible for the lost decade of the 1990 s in Japan.

40|$|Several Danish {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} banks have become distressed {{during and after the}} global financial crisis. In this paper, a multiple logistic regression model is used to identify which factors characterize the distressed Danish banks from 2008 - 12. The factors are chosen from a broad range of variables, i. e. the model is unrestricted. The estimated model identifies the distressed banks fairly well. The variables that altogether best describe the probability of a bank becoming distressed are: a bank's excess capital in per cent of risk weighted assets, the 3 year average lending growth lagged 2 years, property exposure, and a benchmark for stable funding (the so-called funding-ratio). The variables are all adjusted with the sector average to account for the general development during the period. Based on experiences from this and past crises the Danish FSA introduced the so-called Supervisory Diamond as part of its banking supervision in 2010. A multiple logistic regression model is estimated with deviations from limit values set in the supervisory diamond to assess whether the variables in the supervisory diamond differ from the unrestricted model. Overall, the analyses support the establishment of benchmarks. The results of this analysis show that deviations from the benchmarks concerning property exposure and funding-ratio are statistically significant with expected signs. However, deviations from the benchmarks concerning <b>lending</b> growth, large <b>exposures,</b> and excess liquidity cover are statistically insignificant...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} deepen {{the understanding of}} the causes of obstacles to bank lending to the smaller businesses in Nigeria, and to contribute to the literature aimed at finding solutions to this persistent problem. Smaller firms report access to finance as a major obstacle to their growth. With bank credit contributing up to 50 % of their external financing, the research focuses on banking institutions. Perceived as a credit market failure, the economics literature ascribes these credit shortages to problems of informational asymmetry and institutional failure, and in turn, these two issues have dominated the applied research on the subject. This thesis contends that small business credit shortage is a complex phenomenon which needs to be understood {{within the context of the}} specific operating environment. This research is a qualitative case study of a commercial bank in Nigeria that newly entered into the SME credit market using semi-structured interviews and documentary data to explore the obstacles to SME lending and possible solutions. Based on a thematic analysis of the data, the research found that a well-regulated finance industry within the growing economy stimulated opportunities for lending to SMEs. Attracted by these perceived lucrative opportunities, the commercial bank established a successful lending programme developing proprietary credit scoring techniques and innovative devices to overcome institutional barriers and informational obstacles. To encourage more banks to increase lending to the sector, the research concluded with proposals towards removing impediments to SME business lending. These included improving banks' knowledge of <b>specialised</b> techniques to <b>lend</b> to SMEs, business friendly policies to improve the business environment for smaller businesses to reduce their risk of failure, lower interest rates on loans and capacity building to improve management skills of business owners...|$|R

This syndrome is a metaphoric {{account of a}} frog being placed in a tub of water that is slowly heated. However, the frog will not notice the temperature difference until it is slowly boiled to death. The description is merely anecdotal; however, this has not stopped several scientists from trying to prove the theory right, which makes for more interesting reading [1]. What is even more interesting is that this syndrome {{has been linked to}} our apathy to climate change, the economic meltdown, regime changes and career-related stress [2]. At the basic level, the boiling frog syndrome is a cautionary warning against complacency.

However, understanding of prenatal exposure to air pollutants {{and the process of}} intrauterine growth is limited. This dissertation addressed research gaps in this area by evaluating maternal air pollution exposure and fetal growth using a novel methodological approach. Overall, the objective of this dissertation was to assess exposure to ozone (O 3) and particulate matter less than 2. 5 micrometers in aerodynamic diameter (PM 2. 5) during the first trimester and growth trajectories of four fetal anthropometric parameters [head circumference (HC), biparietal diameter (BPD), abdominal circumference (AC), and femur length (FL) ], within a Mexico City cohort of pregnant women. First, a systematic review of the epidemiological literature on maternal exposures to air pollutants and fetal growth, as assessed with data from ultrasound examination of fetal anthropometric parameters, revealed scant and limited research exploring in utero assessment of fetal growth related to prenatal air pollution exposure. Secondly, uncertainty related to the use of repeated ultrasound measurements of fetal parameters performed by multiple clinicians (the inter-observer variability) was found to be minimal, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) ≥ 0. 995. Lastly, we explored differences in fetal anthropometric growth trajectories, estimated with fractional polynomial mixed-effects prediction models, with increased maternal first trimester air pollution exposure, estimated by spatial interpolation models of exposure assessment. Increased maternal exposure to air pollution in the first trimester was negatively associated with the growth of fetal anthropometric parameters at various periods of gestation; point estimates of effect varied by air pollutant and fetal parameter.

In this regard, {{the effect of a}} known {{cell differentiation}} agent, retinoic acid (RA) was analyzed {{in the presence of a}} noxious chemical chlorpyrifos (CPF), an organophosphate (OP), the receptors of which have recently been localized to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The observed imbalance of adipogenic to skeletal differentiation by CPF together with conundrum about adipogenic potential of RA prompted us to delineate their combinatorial effects on C 3 H 10 T½MSC-like undifferentiated cells. Based on MTT assay, the cellular viability was retained by CPF at concentrations ranging from 0. 01 - 50 μM, beyond which it caused cytotoxicity. These non-toxic concentrations also mildly interfered with adipogenesis of C 3 H 10 T½ cells following exposure to adipogenic cocktail. However, upon exposure to RA alone, these MSCs adopted elongated morphology and accumulated lipid vesicles, by day 20, as discerned by phase-contrast and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in concert with enhanced Oil Red O stained cells. This effect got strongly augmented upon exposure to combination of CPF and RA in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneous up-regulation in perilipin- 1 (PLIN 1) and adipsin (ADN) genes, additionally reiterated the adipogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, GSK 3 β pathway was found to be a major player, whereby inhibiting it with lithium chloride (LiCl) resulted in complete blockage of lipid accumulation, accompanied by complete down regulation of PLIN 1 and ADN gene expression. In conclusion, these observations for the first time, <b>lend</b> evidence that <b>exposure</b> of CPF accompanied by RA directs commitment of C 3 H 10 T½ cells to adipogenic differentiation through a process involving a crosstalk at GSK 3 β signaling...|$|R
40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to analyse the impact of financial sector reforms in India during 1990 s on the development of its financial system and assess the possible vulneralibility of the Indian economy to financial crisis as it integrates into the world economy. The Indian financial system is found to have integrated itself, though mildly, {{with the rest of the}} world in terms of trade flows, flow of foreign capital and interactions on the stock markets. There is evidence of financial development in India with financial liberalisation and integration. The capital market is also found to have developed fast. Several determinants of vulnerability have been identified. Major factors / indicators of vulnerability include slow growth of real GDP, external indebtedness, high inflation rate, deteriorating current accounts, real exchange rate appreciation and public sector deficits. Other factors included deteriorating currency <b>exposure,</b> <b>lending</b> booms, weak quality of bank portfolios, and financial sector weaknesses. The results show that the economy is quite strong in terms of low inflation rate, reasonably good growth rate of GDP, large foreign exchange reserves and sufficient control and supervision over its financial system. At the same time, the study reveals that the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP is rising and is likely to rise further on account of the rising import bill of crude oil. Total fiscal deficit of the government (including the Centre and States) as a percentage of GDP is very high as per the international norms. Export growth has declined drastically in the last two years. Although it has picked up since the financial year 1999 - 2000. Saving rate has not increased in the recent past and the ratio of hot money to the foreign exchange reserves has crossed the danger level of 60 percent. Thus, the results provide a mixed picture of the Indian economy. ...|$|R

Preliminary evidence suggests that the stress arising from major life events may serve as a risk factor for cognitive function decline. Evidence also indicates external (e. g., physical activity) and internal factors (i. e., psychological variables) can attenuate the physiologic effects of stress. Thus, there may be two important pathways through which stress affects health. PURPOSE: The primary aim of this dissertation was to investigate the independent and interactive effects of stressful life events on cognitive function among a sample of postmenopausal women. In addition, the possible moderating and or mediating role of external and internal factors on the relationship between stressful life events and cognitive function were examined. METHODS: Data from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study, a randomly selected subset of the Women's Health Initiative Hormone Trial, were analyzed. To control for any treatment effects, only data from participants randomized into the placebo groups were pooled and used for all analyses, leaving a total of 3775 participants. All participants had five data collections points, including baseline through four years of follow-up. Linear mixed effects models were used to answer all prospective research questions. Moderation and mediation models were used to determine presence of effect modification or mediation of external or internal variables. RESULTS: Our results appear to indicate that there was a negative relationship between stressful life events and cognitive function scores. Reporting an ill spouse/partner was associated with lower cognition scores compared to those without reporting a spouse/partner (B = - 0. 68, p < 0. 0001). Exposure to three or more stressful life events at every data collection period was also associated with lower cognitive function scores (B = - 0. 61, p = 0. 021). External factors did not appear to moderate this negative relationship; however, internal factors such as optimism, hostility, and negative expressiveness did. Specifically, exposure to more stressful life events was associated with less favorable psychological states, which in turn, were associated with lower cognitive function scores. CONCLUSION: Our results appear to <b>lend</b> support that <b>exposure</b> to certain life events and repeated exposure of stressful life events is associated with lower cognitive functioning. In addition, our findings provide modest evidence that psychological mechanisms are an important pathway through which stressful life events affect cognitive functioning over time among a representative sample of post-menopausal women. While stressful life events are largely unavoidable, the associated increased risk of cognitive function decline may be in part offset by various psychological factors...|$|R
