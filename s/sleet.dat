5000|$|Sometime after 2002, the Burke {{story was}} {{challenged}} by Lamont <b>Sleets,</b> who played basketball for Murray State University.

However the <b>Sleets</b> story was a hoax, a publicity stunt concocted by the founders of the [...] "National High Five Day" [...] (est. 2002) - they needed a [...] "founder" [...] and so invented the story and plugged in Sleets' name. [...] "We just found the guy <b>Sleets</b> and made up a story," [...] said Conor Lastowka, a founder of National High Five Day and professional comedy writer.|$|R

5|$|December 23/24, 1989: Light rain in Jacksonville {{turns to}} {{freezing}} rain as temperatures drop, and later changes to snow. The snow totals several inches in some locations, {{and results in}} the first White Christmas in the city's history.

5|$|The third (and final) {{practice}} session {{started with a}} morning <b>sleet</b> shower and Anthony Davidson in Toyota's No. 5 entry drove off the circuit at Luffield turn. Davidson later aquaplaned backwards off the track and into the Chapel corner gravel trap. The session was stopped to allow the stricken Toyota to be extracted from the gravel trap and and {{it was able to}} return to the pit lane with assistance from a recovery crane, allowing on-track action to recommence. <b>Sleet</b> later turned to snow necessitating track officials to stop the session for the second time. Driver adviser Yannick Dalmas was asked to assess the track's condition during the stoppage and gave feedback that prompted the session's premature end with half an hour remaining. Eleven cars took to the track but nobody recorded a timed lap. Tincknell completed the most out-laps of any driver in the session with three.|$|E

5|$|Departmental {{locomotives}} on the London Underground {{consist of}} vehicles {{of a number}} of types which are used for engineering purposes. These include battery locomotives, diesel locomotives, electric locomotives, <b>sleet</b> locomotives, pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars. Details of the first four types are covered elsewhere. Pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue to be used by the engineering department. Pilot motor cars are used to move other vehicles around the system, while ballast motor cars are used to haul ballast trains and engineering trains.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{affected}} a large {{region of}} the northeastern United States from West Virginia to Massachusetts with heavy snowfall, <b>sleet,</b> rain, and high winds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed four deaths to the nor'easter, but only included those directly related; the agency did not include storm-induced traffic accidents or heart attacks. The National Climatic Data Center reported 19deaths related to the nor'easter, although news reports shortly after the storm reported 20deaths. Overall damage was estimated between $12billion (1992USD), mostly in New England.|$|E
5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, <b>sleet,</b> hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E
