5|$|The Leipzig 1877 tournament, {{in which}} Anderssen came second behind Louis Paulsen, was {{organized}} {{to commemorate the}} 50th anniversary of Anderssen's learning the chess moves.

5|$|By {{the time}} Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811–1896) moved to Florida in 1867, {{she was already}} internationally famous for {{authoring}} Uncle Tom's Cabin, published as a serial between 1851 and 1852. The novel expounded upon her abolitionist views and was extraordinarily influential in condemning slavery in the United States. Stowe's opposition to slavery <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> a moral passion based on her Christian faith. She had grown up {{the daughter of a}} Presbyterian minister, Lyman Beecher; seven of her brothers became ministers in Calvinist or Congregational denominations, and she married a minister.|$|E

5|$|Crystal Tools {{is a game}} engine {{created and}} used {{internally}} by the Japanese company Square Enix. It combines standard libraries for elements such as graphics, sound and artificial intelligence while providing game developers with various authoring tools. The target systems of Crystal Tools are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. This was decided {{with the intention of}} making cross-platform production more feasible. The idea for the engine <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> Square Enix's desire to have a unified game development environment in order to effectively share the technology and know-how of the company's individual teams.|$|E
5|$|ILM was {{tasked with}} imagining what the {{immediate}} assimilation of an Enterprise crewmember would look like. Jaeger {{came up with}} a set of cables that <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> the Borg's knuckles and buried themselves in the crewmember's neck. Wormlike tubes would course through the victim's body and mechanical devices break the skin. The entire transformation was created using computer-generated imagery. The wormlike geometry was animated over the actor's face, then blended in {{with the addition of a}} skin texture over the animation. The gradual change in skin tone was simulated with shaders.|$|E
5|$|Justinian and {{his successors}} modernized {{frontier}} fortifications throughout the century. The example at Qasr ibn Wardan (564) {{in the desert}} of eastern Syria is particularly impressive, containing a governor's palace, barracks, and a church built with techniques and to plans possibly imported from Constantinople. The church dome is unusual in that the pendentives <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> an octagonal drum, rather than the four main arches, and {{in that it was}} made of brick, which was rare in Syria.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{critical}} commentary varies. One critic {{points out}} that the faces of the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or the position of a tail conveys what the faces lack. One critic believes the tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> a picture and story letter to a child. Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E
5|$|When the {{interior}} wall fell, the men, true to their promise, <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> the ruins and fought with great courage, forcing Philip {{to send his}} troops forward in relays to the front line. By nightfall the Macedonians retreated to camp. That night the Abydenians resolved to save {{the women and children}} and at daybreak they sent some priests and priestess with a garland across to the Macedonians, surrendering the city to Philip.|$|E
5|$|Control of the {{building}} project passed from the Scottish Office to the cross-party Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) on 1 June 1999, headed by the Parliament's then Presiding Officer, Sir David Steel, {{at a time of}} increasing costs. Rising costs <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> the need for a formal entrance and the need to accommodate parliamentary staff in light of better knowledge of how Parliament was working at its primary location on the Royal Mile, where it was clear there were staff overcrowding problems. With the cost increases in mind, and heightened media interest in the Holyrood Project, the Members of the Scottish Parliament held a debate on whether to continue with construction on 17 June 1999 voting by a majority of 66 to 57 in favour to complete the project.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th century, {{priests of}} {{different}} religious orders {{set out to}} evangelize the Americas, bringing Christianity to indigenous communities. Two of these missionary orders were the Franciscans and the Jesuits, both of which eventually arrived in the frontier town of Santa Cruz de la Sierra {{and then in the}} Chiquitania. The missionaries employed the strategy of gathering the often nomadic indigenous populations in larger communities called reductions in order to more effectively Christianize them. This policy <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> the colonial legal view of the “Indian” as a minor, who had to be protected and guided by European missionaries so as not to succumb to sin. Reductions generally were construed as instruments to enable the natives adopt European lifestyles and values; {{this was not the case}} in the Jesuit reductions, however, where the Jesuits allowed the inhabitants to retain many pre-colonial cultural practices.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus, though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring Crocus. Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in Aprill of his Shepheardes Calender (1579).|$|E

5|$|Notwithstanding {{the level}} of {{controversy}} surrounding cost, the Scottish Parliament Building proved controversial {{in a number of}} other respects: the decision to construct a new building, the choice of site, the selection of a non-Scottish architect, and the selection of Bovis as construction manager after having earlier been excluded from the shortlist. In 1997, the initial cost of constructing a new Parliament building was given as £40 million, a figure produced by the Scottish Office, prior to the September 1997 devolution referendum, and subsequently revealed to be the figure for housing MSPs. Further controversy surrounding the project <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> the selection of the Holyrood site, which was a late entrant onto the list of sites to be considered, and the rejection of the Royal High School on Calton Hill, long thought to be the home of any future devolved Scottish Parliament. After a formal visit to the Royal High School by Dewar and his aides on 30 May 1997, it was rejected as unsuitable on the grounds of size and location.|$|E
5|$|Scarification had {{its origins}} in Nri mythology. Nri, the son of Eri who {{established}} the town of Nri, {{was said to have}} pleaded to Chukwu (the Great God) because of hunger. Chukwu then ordered him to cut off his first son's and daughter's heads and plant them, creating a 'blood bond' between the Igbo and the earth deity, Ana. Before doing so, Nri was ordered to mark ichi onto their two foreheads. Coco yam, a crop managed by females, <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> his daughter's head, and yam, the Igbo peoples' staple crop, sprung from his son's head; Chukwu had taught Nri plant domestication. From this, the eze Nri's first son and daughter were required to undergo scarification's seven days after birth, with the eze Nri's daughter being the only female to receive ichi. Nri, the son of Eri, also gained knowledge of the yam medicine (ogwu ji). People from other Igbo communities made pilgrimages to Nri in order to receive this knowledge received in exchange for annual tributes.|$|E
5|$|The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs (1876) is an epic poem of over 10,000 lines by William Morris {{that tells}} the tragic story, drawn from the Volsunga Saga and the Elder Edda, of the Norse hero Sigmund, his son Sigurd (the {{equivalent}} of Siegfried in the Nibelungenlied and Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung) and Sigurd's wife Gudrun. It <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> a fascination with the Volsung legend that extended back twenty years to the author's youth, and had already resulted in several other literary and scholarly treatments of the story. It was Morris's own favorite of his poems, and was enthusiastically praised both by contemporary critics and by such figures as T. E. Lawrence and George Bernard Shaw. In recent years it has been rated very highly by many William Morris scholars, but has never succeeded in finding a wide readership on account of its great length and archaic diction. It {{has been seen as}} an influence on such fantasy writers as Andrew Lang and J. R. R. Tolkien. The Story of Sigurd is available in modern reprints, both in its original form and in a cut-down version, but there is no critical edition.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} Lightning Returns battle system {{originated}} while ideas were being discussed for the battle system in Final Fantasy XIII, but technical limitations and problems implementing it in a party-based battle system prevented {{it from being}} used in that game. It reemerged {{when some of the}} development team wanted Lightning to change her appearance during battle, and reducing to one playable character opened up the memory space necessary for such a system to be implemented. In making the system revolve around one character, the developers ended up removing any opportunity for story scenes between party members, which was cited by Abe as its main weakness. The time limit <b>sprang</b> <b>from</b> the story concept of a world with a set time to live. When the feature was first announced, there were some who felt it was too new a thing, as a time limit was seen as a taboo in role-playing video games. The mechanic originally received negative feedback from test players who were unable to complete the game in time. In response to this, the team made adjustments so that players were given a more comfortable amount of time. Along with sharing design elements with the previous two XIII games, the system also bears similarities to the battle system of Final Fantasy XV, although the developers said that they were not directly inspired by it.|$|E
