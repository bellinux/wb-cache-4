5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{was introduced}} to Australia by a bird dealer visiting Melbourne in early 1857, and its range has expanded from its initial foothold in Melbourne and Adelaide to include all of south-eastern Australia, including Tasmania and the Bass Strait islands. The introduced population in Australia is considered a pest because it damages a variety of soft fruits in orchards, parks and gardens including berries, cherries, <b>stone</b> <b>fruit</b> and grapes. It is thought to spread weeds, such as blackberry, and may compete with native birds for food and nesting sites.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of plant {{material}} is also consumed, including the fruit or berries of Ficus species, Leucopogon species, Exocarpos species, a cycad Macrozamia riedlei, a mistletoe Lysiana exocarpi, Astroloma humifusum, A.pinifolium, Myoporum insulare, Enchylaena tomentosa and Coprosma quadrifida. The grey currawong also eats berries of introduced plants such as Pyracantha angustifolia and P.fortuneana, and Cotoneaster species, and crops such as maize, apples, pears, quince, various <b>stone</b> <b>fruit</b> of the genus Prunus, grapes, tomato, passion flowers, and the nectar of gymea lily (Doryanthes excelsa). On Kangaroo Island, the grey currawong {{has been identified as}} the main vector for the spread of bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides). Boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subspecies monilifera), another invasive species readily dispersed in bird droppings, is also consumed by grey currawongs. In Tasmania, A.pinifolium is especially popular, and one observer noted that the normally noisy birds became quiet and sluggish after eating it, prompting him to wonder whether the plant had a narcotic effect on the birds.|$|E
5|$|Red wattlebirds are {{adversely}} {{impacted by}} land and undergrowth clearing, and have vanished from some habitats thus altered. Despite this, they {{are classified as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List as they occur over a wide range, have a large population, and the population decline is not rapid. Red wattlebirds are regularly killed by cats and dogs, {{as well as being}} hit by cars on roads. In 1924 in northern Victoria, the red wattlebird was described as very wary, on account of being highly regarded (and shot) for its meat. Indeed, it was shot widely for food or sport, or because it was held to be a pest of vineyards or orchards. On occasion, red wattlebirds have raided vineyards and orchards for grapes, <b>stone</b> <b>fruit,</b> figs, olives, loquats, apples, pears and berries, which they puncture and extract the juice or flesh from.|$|E
50|$|The hosts for Leucostoma canker include <b>stone</b> <b>fruits</b> such as {{cultivated}} peach, plum, prune, cherry (Prunus spp.), {{or other}} wild Prunus spp. It {{can also be}} found on apple (Malus domestica). <b>Stone</b> <b>fruits</b> are referred to as drupe, which are fruits containing a seed encased by a hard endocarp, surrounded by a fleshy outer portion.|$|R

50|$|Portland is {{abundant}} in wild foods dependent on season. Spring is when wild apples and <b>stone</b> <b>fruits</b> are in bloom. Summer {{is the season}} for ripe blackberries, which are a noxious weed, and the more difficult to locate <b>stone</b> <b>fruits.</b> During Autumn, apples, pears and quince are ripe and the forests are rich with mushrooms. Lactarius deliciosus and Boletes (Boletus portentosus) are safe to eat.|$|R
25|$|Fruit growing {{had become}} the primary {{industry}} in the area by the 1830s as the larger estates were divided into smaller tenant or owner occupied holdings and a second wave of settlers moved into the area. Orange, other citrus, <b>stone</b> <b>fruit,</b> apple and pear orchards were common interspersed with crops such as potatoes and peas. Familiar names in the district, often from a convict background, had set down roots including the Mobbs, Eyles, Spurway, Sonter and other families.|$|E
25|$|Napier markets {{itself as}} the Art Deco Capital. Its Mediterranean climate {{supports}} a vibrant café culture, and excellent cuisine. Wine {{is important in the}} whole Hawke's Bay region, which is renowned for producing some of the world's finest wines, with over 70 wineries located in the area. The region featured in Wine Enthusiast Magazine as one of the 10 Best Wine Travel Destinations in 2015. The region is New Zealand's largest apple, pear and <b>stone</b> <b>fruit</b> producer. The Port of Napier and rail network provides quick export of these goods.|$|E
25|$|Hastings District, {{as one of}} {{the largest}} apple, pear and <b>stone</b> <b>fruit</b> {{producing}} areas in New Zealand, has an important relationship with the Napier Port. It has also become an important grape growing and wine production area with the fruit passing from the growers around Metropolitan Hastings and then to Napier for exporting. Napier is an important service centre for the agriculture and pastoral output of the predominantly rural Hastings District. Shopping is heavily weighted by large format retail in Hastings City, whereas in contrast, Havelock North, Taradale and central Napier retail areas have a more vibrant boutique flavour.|$|E

25|$|The {{flowers are}} very small, in greenish-white in {{clusters}} {{at the top}} of a long stalk and a rich source or nectar for bees. They are often dioecious so a male and female tree in proximity is required to set seed, however, many trees are also polygamo-dioecious, which means they have both male and female flowers on the same tree. The fruit is a black-blue, ovoid <b>stone</b> <b>fruit,</b> about 10mm long with a thin, oily, bitter-to-sour tasting flesh and very popular with small bird species. There are from one to three fruits together on a long slender stalk. They are a valuable energy food for birds, especially the American robin.|$|E
25|$|Napier is {{the nexus}} of the largest wool centre in the Southern Hemisphere, {{and it has the}} primary export seaport for northeastern New Zealand – which is the largest {{producer}} of apples, pears, and <b>stone</b> <b>fruit</b> in New Zealand. Napier has also become an important grape and wine production area, with the grapes grown around Hastings and Napier being sent through the Port of Napier for export. Large amounts of sheep's wool, frozen meat, wood pulp, and timber also pass through Napier annually for export. Smaller amounts of these materials are shipped via road and railway to the large metropolitan areas of New Zealand itself, such as Auckland, Wellington and Hamilton.|$|E
25|$|More than 26,000 square {{kilometres}} (10,000sqmi) of Victorian farmland are sown for grain, {{mostly in}} the state's west. More than 50% of this area is sown for wheat, 33% for barley and 7% for oats. A further 6,000 square kilometres (2,300sqmi) is sown for hay. In 2003–04, Victorian farmers produced more than 3 million tonnes of wheat and 2million tonnes of barley. Victorian farms produce nearly 90% of Australian pears and third of apples. It is also a leader in <b>stone</b> <b>fruit</b> production. The main vegetable crops include asparagus, broccoli, carrots, potatoes and tomatoes. Last year, 121,200 tonnes of pears and 270,000 tonnes of tomatoes were produced.|$|E

40|$|There were no {{detailed}} investigations on {{bacterial diseases}} of <b>stone</b> <b>fruits</b> in Lithuania so far. The study on diversity, distribution and {{identification of the}} most harmful bacterial diseases and their causal agents was started only recently. The evaluation of bacterial disease symptoms, isolation and primary characterization of isolated strains were carried out. Bacterial canker caused by Pseudomonas syringae bacteria was found on <b>stone</b> <b>fruits</b> (plums, sweet and sour cherry) in Lithuania. Bacterial spot caused by quarantine bacterium Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni was not detected...|$|R
25|$|At {{around this}} time the first plantings of Pinot noir in Central Otago {{occurred}} in the Kawarau Gorge. Central Otago had a long (for New Zealand) history as a producer of quality <b>stone</b> <b>fruit</b> and particularly cherries. Significantly further south than all other wine regions in New Zealand, it had been overlooked despite {{a long history of}} grape growing. However, it benefited from being surrounded by mountain ranges which increased its temperature variations both between seasons and between night and day making the climate unusual in the typically maritime conditions in New Zealand. In recent years Pinot noir from Central Otago has won numerous international awards and accolations making it one of New Zealand's most sought-after varieties.|$|E
25|$|Amygdalin is {{contained}} in <b>stone</b> <b>fruit</b> kernels, such as apricot (8%), peach (6%), bitter almond (5%), and plum (2.5%); amygdalin {{is also found in}} the seeds of the apple. The stones are taken out of the fruit and cracked to obtain the kernels, which are dried in the sun or in ovens. The kernels are boiled in ethanol; on evaporation of the solution and the addition of diethyl ether, amygdalin is precipitated as white minute crystals. Natural amygdalin has the (R)-configuration at the chiral phenyl center. Under mild basic conditions, this stereogenic center isomerizes; the (S)-epimer is called neoamygdalin. Although the synthesized version of amygdalin is the (R)-epimer, the stereogenic center attached to the nitrile and phenyl groups easily epimerizes if the manufacturer does not store the compound correctly.|$|E

500|$|The pied currawong is an {{omnivorous}} and opportunistic feeder, eating {{fruit and}} berries {{as well as}} preying on many invertebrates, and smaller vertebrates, mostly juvenile birds and bird eggs. Currawongs will hunt in trees, snatching birds and eggs from nests, as well as insects and berries from trees. They also hunt {{in the air and}} on the ground. Insects predominate in the diet during summer months, and fruit during the winter. They will often scavenge, eating scraps and rubbish and can be quite bold when seeking food from people, lingering around picnic areas and bird-feeding trays. Beetles and ants are the most common types of insects consumed. Pied currawongs have been recorded taking mice, as well as chickens and turkeys from farms. The pied currawong consumes fruit, including a wide variety of figs, such as the Moreton Bay (Ficus macrophylla), Port Jackson [...] (F. rubiginosa), Banyan (F. virens) and Strangler fig (F. watkinsiana), as well as lillypillies (Syzygium species), white cedar (Melia azedarach), plum pine (Podocarpus elatus), and geebungs (Persoonia species). Other fruit is also sought after, and currawongs have been known to raid orchards, eating apples, pears, strawberries, grapes, <b>stone</b> <b>fruit,</b> citrus, and corn. Pied currawongs have been responsible for the spread of the invasive ornamental Asparagus aethiopicus (often called A. densiflorus) in the Sydney area, the weedy privet species Ligustrum lucidum and L.sinense, and firethorn species Pyracantha angustifolia and P.rogersiana around Armidale.|$|E
