40|$|We {{consider}} a sequential decision problem where the rewards are {{generated by a}} piecewise-stationary distribution. However, the different reward distributions are unknown and may change at unknown instants. Our approach uses {{a limited number of}} <b>side</b> <b>observations</b> <b>on</b> past rewards, but does not require prior knowledge of the frequency of changes. In spite of the adversarial nature of the reward process, we provide an algorithm whose regret, with respect to the baseline with perfect knowledge of the distributions and the changes, is O(k log(T)), where k is the number of changes up to time T. This is in contrast to the case where side observations are not available, and where the regret is at least Ω (√ T). 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an adversarial online learning setting where a decision maker can choose an action in {{every stage of}} the game. In addition to observing the reward of the chosen action, the decision maker gets <b>side</b> <b>observations</b> <b>on</b> the reward he would have obtained had he chosen {{some of the other}} actions. The observation structure is encoded as a graph, where node i is linked to node j if sampling i provides information on the reward of j. This setting naturally interpolates between the well-known "experts" setting, where the decision maker can view all rewards, and the multi-armed bandits setting, where the decision maker can only view the reward of the chosen action. We develop practical algorithms with provable regret guarantees, which depend on non-trivial graph-theoretic properties of the information feedback structure. We also provide partially-matching lower bounds. Comment: Presented at the NIPS 2011 conferenc...|$|R
40|$|The cell {{membrane}} {{plays a key}} role in compartmentalization, nutrient transportation and signal transduction, while the pattern of protein distribution at both cytoplasmic and ectoplasmic sides of the {{cell membrane}} remains elusive. Using a combination of single-molecule techniques, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), to study the structure of nucleated cell membranes, we found that (1) proteins at the ectoplasmic side of the cell membrane form a dense protein layer (4 nm) on top of a lipid bilayer; (2) proteins aggregate to form islands evenly dispersed at the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane with a height of about 10 - 12 nm; (3) cholesterol-enriched domains exist within the cell membrane; (4) carbohydrates stay in microdomains at the ectoplasmic side; and (5) exposed amino groups are asymmetrically distributed <b>on</b> both <b>sides.</b> Based <b>on</b> these <b>observations,</b> we proposed a Protein Layer-Lipid-Protein Island (PLLPI) model, to provide a better understanding of cell membrane structure, membrane trafficking and viral fusion mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the "searching for a trail in a maze" composite hypothesis testing problem, {{in which one}} attempts to detect an anomalous directed path in a lattice 2 D box of <b>side</b> n based <b>on</b> <b>observations</b> <b>on</b> the nodes of the box. Under the signal hypothesis, one observes independent Gaussian variables of unit variance at all nodes, with zero, mean off the anomalous path and mean \mu_n on it. Under the null hypothesis, one observes i. i. d. standard Gaussians on all nodes. Arias-Castro et al. (2008) showed that if the unknown directed path under the signal hypothesis has known the initial location, then detection is possible (in the minimax sense) if \mu_n >> 1 /\sqrt log n, {{while it is not}} possible if \mu_n << 1 / log n\sqrt log log n. In this paper, we show that this result continues to hold even when the initial location of the unknown path is not known. As is the case with Arias-Castro et al. (2008), the upper bound here also applies when the path is undirected. The improvement is achieved by replacing the linear detection statistic used in Arias-Castro et al. (2008) with a polynomial statistic, which is obtained by employing a multi-scale analysis on a quadratic statistic to bootstrap its performance. Our analysis is motivated by ideas developed {{in the context of the}} analysis of random polymers in Lacoin (2010) ...|$|R
