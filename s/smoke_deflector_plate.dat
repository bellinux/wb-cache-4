5|$|The last {{modification}} of the class undertaken by Maunsell was the gradual introduction of small <b>smoke</b> <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> from 1934. These were fitted to improve driver visibility {{as a result of}} smoke deflection experiments made on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927. Maunsell retired from the Southern Railway in 1937 and his replacement was Oliver Bulleid. Despite making various modifications to the steam circuit on other Maunsell classes, Bulleid saw no reason to make such drastic alterations to the N1class. As a result, the final set of modifications made under Southern Railway ownership was made after the Second World War and included the removal of superfluous smokebox-mounted anti-vacuum snifting valves and the replacement of the wide-diameter N1 chimney with the U1 type to improve draughting on the prototype; the standard Nclass chimneys of the other five were also replaced. The class was well-used by British Railways over both Central and Eastern sections between 1948 and 1962 and justified the fitting of Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1959 alongside the Nclass.|$|R
500|$|As mentioned, {{the main}} {{production}} batch of Southern-built locomotives {{differed from the}} two prototypes, Channel Packet and Union Castle. [...] The steam-operated firehole door treadle was removed, and {{a new type of}} boiler cladding was utilised in response to the worsening supply situation during the Second World War. [...] Modification was also made to the air-smoothed casing surrounding the smokebox after reports were made of drifting smoke obscuring the locomotive crew's vision ahead. Initially, the only form of smoke deflection was a narrow slot in front of the chimney, intended to enable air to lift the smoke when the locomotive was travelling. This proved inadequate because of the relatively soft exhaust blast that came from the multiple-jet blastpipe, which failed to be caught by the air flow. [...] After several trials, the air flow was increased by extending the casing roof over the front of the smokebox to form a cowling whilst side <b>smoke</b> <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> were also incorporated into the front of the air-smoothed casing. The latter added to the poor visibility from the footplate and the expedients combined never fully solved the smoke drift problem.|$|R

5|$|Following {{a report}} by George Ivatt in 1945, <b>smoke</b> <b>deflectors</b> were {{introduced}} due to drifting smoke obscuring the crew's forward vision.

40|$|Savonius rotor is a {{vertical}} axis rotor with simple {{in design and}} easy to fabricate at lower cost. The rotation of the rotor {{is due to the}} drag difference between the advancing blade and returning blade. Net driving force can be increased by reducing the reverse force on the returning blade or increasing the positive force on the advancing blade. Former can be realized by providing a flow obstacle to the returning blade and latter can be realized by concentrating the flow towards the advancing blade. The objective of the present work is to identify the optimal position of the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> (on advancing blade side) placed upstream to the flow which would result in increase in power generated by the rotor. Tests are conducted to identify the optimum position of the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> on the advancing blade side {{in the presence of a}} <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> on the returning blade side at its optimum position. Results suggest that two <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> placed at their optimal positions upstream to the flow increase the coefficient of power to 0. 35. This is significantly higher than the coefficient of power of 0. 14 observed for the rotor without <b>deflector</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R
