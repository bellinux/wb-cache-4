This opened up a discussion on gamesmanship, asking {{the question of whether}} players in that situation should be condemned as a cheat, or applauded for their resourcefulness. One pundit, Paul Fletcher of the BBC, implied that most players would do the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 'heat of the moment' in order to avoid defeat. Ghana's sports minister, Akua Sena Dansua, called for changes to the rules in such circumstances.|$|E

The word beer comes from Old English bēor, from Proto-Germanic *beuzą, probably from Proto-Indo-European *bʰeusóm, originally [...] "brewer's yeast, beer dregs", although other theories {{have been provided}} connecting the word with Old English bēow, [...] "barley", or Latin bibere, [...] "to drink". On the currency of two words for the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Germanic languages, the 12th-century Old Icelandic poem Alvíssmál says, [...] "Ale it is called among men, but among the gods, beer." ...|$|E

Crosby's fellow countryman and Olympic teammate, Rick Nash of the New York Rangers was questioned by the media about this, at one point saying, [...] "I think he's a tough guy to keep up with.

The ship was withdrawn from the Black Sea in mid-1920 to observe the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–22 and the Chanak Crisis of late 1922.

500|$|During Russ' trial, Mercedes {{decided to}} go to the court to testify for him due to Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox), who {{explained}} to Mercedes that her sister died because Justin Burton (Chris Fountain) was [...] "too gutless to come forward and tell the truth".

On her way to the court however, Mercedes was [...] "all over the place". According to Metcalfe, everyone was shocked when Mercedes walked into the courtroom. She said that Mercedes was unsure of {{what she was going to}} tell the court, [...] "but her alibi is vital to Warren's case - his fate lies in her hands". Metcalfe said that even if Mercedes and Russ ended their relationship, which they did shortly after she confessed the truth, would not matter because she believed that it would not take Mercedes [...] "long before she goes back to her old ways" [...] because [...] "that's just the type of person she is - Mercedes likes playing the field and having fun, and no man's going to change her" ...|$|E

Dumbledore and Grindelwald suggested that they had to move to carry on their plans, but Aberforth refused because Ariana's state did not allow her to be moved. The discussion between Albus, Aberforth and Grindelwald turned into a duel that resulted in Ariana's accidental death. According to the author, {{as a result of this}} incident, Albus's boggart became Ariana's corpse. In Philosopher's Stone, he mentions to Harry that the deepest desire of his heart, revealed by the Mirror of Erised, is to have a pair of woollen socks.

2500|$|Sin and Punishment {{is set in}} a dystopian (then) {{near future}} of 2007, when {{humanity}} is struggling with a planet-wide famine. To solve this problem, scientists develop a new genetically-engineered species to raise as food. These creatures are herded in northern Japan until they mutate and begin attacking the country's citizens. They are dubbed [...] "Ruffians". An international peacekeeping organization called the Armed Volunteers tries to stop the creatures, but they also oppress the Japanese people. Another group, led by a mysterious woman with unusual powers named Achi, rises up to defend Japan against the Ruffians and Armed Volunteers. Within her group are Saki and Airan, the protagonists of the game. Between battles with the Ruffians and Armed Volunteers, Saki unintentionally morphs into an enormous Ruffian after falling into a rising tide of blood filling up Tokyo. To bring Saki back to normal, Achi tells Airan that she will need to shoot Saki, but Airan refuses to do this. In response, Achi places Airan into a dream sequence, set ten years in the future in New York City. Here she meets her future son she shares with Saki, and sees a Ruffian Saki rampaging through the city. The dream ends with her shooting Saki, and then waking up to realize that Achi manipulated her into doing the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present.|$|E
2500|$|This event {{formed the}} {{cornerstone}} of Patel's popularity in the post-independence era. Even today he is remembered {{as the man who}} united India. He is, in this regard, compared to Otto von Bismarck of Germany, who did the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1860s. Under the plan of 3June, more than 562 princely states were given the option of joining either India or Pakistan, or choosing independence. Indian nationalists and large segments of the public feared that if these states did not accede, most of the people and territory would be fragmented. The Congress as well as senior British officials considered Patel the best man for the task of achieving unification of the princely states with the Indian dominion. Gandhi had said to Patel, [...] "he problem of the States is so difficult that you alone can solve it". Patel was considered a statesman of integrity with the practical acumen and resolve to accomplish a monumental task. He asked V.P.Menon, a senior civil servant with whom he had worked on the partition of India, to become his right-hand man as chief secretary of the States Ministry. On 6May 1947, Patel began lobbying the princes, attempting to make them receptive towards dialogue with the future government and forestall potential conflicts. Patel used social meetings and unofficial surroundings to engage most of the monarchs, inviting them to lunch and tea at his home in Delhi. At these meetings, Patel explained that there was no inherent conflict between the Congress and the princely order. Patel invoked the patriotism of India's monarchs, asking them to join in the independence of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people. He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic, especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects. He proposed favourable terms for the merger, including the creation of privy purses for the rulers' descendants. While encouraging the rulers to act out of patriotism, Patel did not rule out force. Stressing that the princes would need to accede to India in good faith, he set a deadline of 15August 1947 for them to sign the instrument of accession document. All but three of the states willingly merged into the Indian union; only Jammu and Kashmir, Junagadh, and Hyderabad did not fall into his basket.|$|E

50|$|The {{celestial}} sphere {{can be considered}} to be infinite in radius. This means any point within it, including that occupied by the observer, can be considered the center. It also means that all parallel lines, be they millimetres apart or across the Solar System from each other, will seem to intersect the sphere at a single point, analogous to the vanishing point of graphical perspective. All parallel planes will seem to intersect <b>the</b> sphere <b>in</b> a coincident great circle (a “vanishing circle”).Conversely, observers looking toward the same point on an infinite-radius {{celestial sphere}} will be looking along parallel lines, and observers looking toward the same great circle, along parallel planes.
