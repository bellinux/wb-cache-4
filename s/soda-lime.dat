5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different glasses often have {{different}} rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very low thermal expansion, while <b>soda-lime</b> glass has very high thermal expansion. When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|High-quality {{glass from}} Roman {{manufacturers}} in Alexandria and Syria was exported to {{many parts of}} Asia, including Han China. The first Roman glassware discovered in China is a blue <b>soda-lime</b> glass bowl dating to the early 1st century BC and excavated from a Western Han tomb in the southern port city of Guangzhou, which may have come there via the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Other Roman glass items include a mosaic-glass bowl found in a prince's tomb near Nanjing dated to 67 AD and a glass bottle with opaque white streaks found in an Eastern Han tomb of Luoyang. Roman and Persian glassware {{has been found in}} a 5th-century AD tomb of Gyeongju, Korea, capital of ancient Silla, east of China. Roman glass beads have been discovered as far as Japan, within the 5th-century AD Kofun-era Utsukushi burial mound near Kyoto.|$|E
25|$|Glass making: More {{than half}} the {{worldwide}} production of soda ash is used to make glass. Bottle and window glass (<b>Soda-lime</b> glass) is made by melting a mixture of sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate and silica sand (silicon dioxide (SiO2)).|$|E
25|$|Following {{the glass}} batch {{preparation}} and mixing, {{the raw materials}} are transported to the furnace. <b>Soda-lime</b> glass for mass production is melted in gas fired units. Smaller scale furnaces for specialty glasses include electric melters, pot furnaces, and day tanks.|$|E
25|$|Examples of such glasses have {{commercial}} significance, e.g. <b>soda-lime</b> glass, borosilicate glass, lead glass. In these glasses, silica is {{termed the}} network former or lattice former. The reaction {{is also used}} in blast furnaces to remove sand impurities in the ore by neutralisation with calcium oxide, forming calcium silicate slag.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the glass}} inlays of the Gundestrup {{cauldron}} have been determined {{through the use}} of X-ray fluorescence radiation to be of a <b>soda-lime</b> type composition. The glass contained elements that can be attributed to calcareous sand and mineral soda, typical of the east coast of the Mediterranean region. The analyses also narrowed down the production time of the glass to between the second century BC and first century AD.|$|E
25|$|Soda-lime-silica glass, window glass: silica + {{sodium oxide}} (Na2O) + lime (CaO) + {{magnesia}} (MgO) + alumina (Al2O3). Is transparent, easily formed and {{most suitable for}} window glass (see flat glass). It has a high thermal expansion and poor resistance to heat (500–600°C). It is used for windows, some low-temperature incandescent light bulbs, and tableware. Container glass is a <b>soda-lime</b> glass that is a slight variation on flat glass, which uses more alumina and calcium, and less sodium and magnesium, which are more water-soluble. This makes it less susceptible to water erosion.|$|E
25|$|Silica {{is used to}} make fire brick, a type of ceramic. Silicate {{minerals}} {{are also}} in whiteware ceramics, an important class of products usually containing various types of fired clay minerals (natural aluminium phyllosilicates). An example is porcelain {{which is based on}} the silicate mineral kaolinite. Traditional glass (silica-based <b>soda-lime</b> glass) also functions in many of the same ways, and is also used for windows and containers. In addition, specialty silica based glass fibers are used for optical fiber, as well as to produce fiberglass for structural support and glass wool for thermal insulation.|$|E
25|$|Most silicon is used commercially {{without being}} separated, and often with little {{processing}} {{of the natural}} minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with clays, silica sand, and stone. Silicates are used in Portland cement for mortar and stucco, and mixed with silica sand and gravel to make concrete for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware ceramics such as porcelain, and in traditional quartz-based <b>soda-lime</b> glass and many other specialty glasses. Silicon compounds such as silicon carbide are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics.|$|E
25|$|Float {{glass is}} {{a sheet of}} glass made by {{floating}} molten glass {{on a bed of}} molten metal, typically tin, although lead and various low melting point alloys were used in the past. This method gives the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces. Modern windows are made from float glass. Most float glass is <b>soda-lime</b> glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate and flat panel display glass are also produced using the float glass process. The float glass process is also known as the Pilkington process, named after the British glass manufacturer Pilkington, who pioneered the technique (invented by Sir Alastair Pilkington) in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{borosilicate}} glass, Pyrex: silica + boron trioxide (B2O3) + soda (Na2O) + alumina (Al2O3). Stands {{heat expansion}} {{much better than}} window glass. Used for chemical glassware, cooking glass, car head lamps, etc. Borosilicate glasses (e.g. Pyrex, Duran) have as main constituents silica and boron trioxide. They have fairly low coefficients of thermal expansion (7740 Pyrex CTE is 3.25/°C as compared to about 9/°C for a typical <b>soda-lime</b> glass), making them more dimensionally stable. The lower {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) also makes them less subject to stress caused by thermal expansion, thus less vulnerable to cracking from thermal shock. They are commonly used for reagent bottles, optical components and household cookware.|$|E
25|$|Addition of lead(II) oxide lowers melting point, lowers {{viscosity}} of the melt, {{and increases}} refractive index. Lead oxide also facilitates solubility of other metal oxides {{and is used}} in colored glasses. The viscosity decrease of lead glass melt is very significant (roughly 100 times in comparison with soda glasses); this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in vitreous enamels and glass solders. The high ionic radius of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than <b>soda-lime</b> glass (108.5 vs 106.5Ω⋅cm, DC at 250°C). For more details, see lead glass.|$|E
25|$|Most ceramic {{materials}} are almost entirely immune to corrosion. The strong chemical bonds that hold them together leave very little free chemical {{energy in the}} structure; they {{can be thought of}} as already corroded. When corrosion does occur, it is almost always a simple dissolution of the material or chemical reaction, rather than an electrochemical process. A common example of corrosion protection in ceramics is the lime added to <b>soda-lime</b> glass to reduce its solubility in water; though it is not nearly as soluble as pure sodium silicate, normal glass does form sub-microscopic flaws when exposed to moisture. Due to its brittleness, such flaws cause a dramatic reduction in the strength of a glass object during its first few hours at room temperature.|$|E
2500|$|Fused quartz is a glass {{made from}} chemically-pure silica. It has {{excellent}} resistance to thermal shock, {{being able to}} survive immersion in water while red hot. [...] However, its high melting temperature (1723°C) and viscosity {{make it difficult to}} work with. [...] Normally, other substances are added to simplify processing. One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, [...] "soda"), which lowers the glass-transition temperature. The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (CaO, calcium oxide, generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a <b>soda-lime</b> glass. <b>Soda-lime</b> glasses account for about 90% of manufactured glass.|$|E
2500|$|The high ionic {{radius of}} the Pb2+ ion renders it highly {{immobile}} in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than <b>soda-lime</b> glass (108.5 vs 106.5 Ohm·cm, DC at [...] ). Lead-containing glass is therefore frequently used in light fixtures.|$|E
2500|$|Glass is a non-crystalline {{amorphous}} solid {{that is often}} transparent and has widespread practical, technological, and decorative usage in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optoelectronics. The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of glass are [...] "silicate glasses" [...] based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand. [...] The term glass, in popular usage, {{is often used to}} refer only to this type of material, which is familiar from use as window glass and in glass bottles. Of the many silica-based glasses that exist, ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a specific type called <b>soda-lime</b> glass, composed of approximately 75% silicon dioxide (SiO2), sodium oxide (Na2O) from sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), calcium oxide, also called lime (CaO), and several minor additives.|$|E
2500|$|During early 1863, John L. Hobbs (the elder Hobbs) became {{convinced}} that glass made with lime instead of lead {{would be a better}} product. [...] He began testing various combinations of ingredients to make high quality glass without lead, but his experiments were not successful. [...] In the fall of the same year, William Leighton Sr. joined the firm as a partner, and continued the experiments with lime glass. [...] Leighton came from a glass making family, and had worked at New England Glass Company. [...] In 1864, Leighton had success. [...] His major change in the formula for glass was using bicarbonate of soda instead of soda ash. [...] His formula was similar to the long-lost <b>soda-lime</b> formula used many years earlier in Europe. [...] The glass made using this formula had good enough quality that the company could compete in the high-end of the glassware market.|$|E
2500|$|Ordinary <b>soda-lime</b> glass appears colorless to {{the naked}} eye when it is thin, {{although}} iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further FeO and chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3) additions may be used for the production of green bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere. Manganese dioxide can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron(II) oxide. Art glass and studio glass pieces are colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and [...] "cook" [...] times. Most colored glass used in the art market is manufactured in volume by vendors who serve this market, although there are some glassmakers with the ability to make their own color from raw materials.|$|E
2500|$|The {{addition}} of lead oxide to potash glass also reduces its viscosity, rendering it more fluid than ordinary soda glass above softening temperature (about [...] ), with a working point of [...] The viscosity of glass varies radically with temperature, {{but that of}} lead glass is roughly 100 times {{less than that of}} ordinary soda glasses across working temperature ranges (up to [...] ). From the glassmaker’s perspective, this results in two practical developments. First, lead glass may be worked at a lower temperature, leading to its use in enamelling, and second, clear vessels may be made free from trapped air bubbles with considerably less difficulty than with ordinary glasses, allowing the manufacture of perfectly clear, flawless objects. When tapped, lead crystal makes a ringing sound, unlike ordinary glasses. Consumers still rely on this property to distinguish it from cheaper glasses. Since the potassium ions are bound more tightly in a lead-silica matrix than in a <b>soda-lime</b> glass, the former when struck absorbs more energy. This causes the lead crystal to oscillate, thereby producing its characteristic sound. Lead also increases the solubility of tin, copper, and antimony, leading to its use in colored enamels and glazes. The low viscosity of lead glass melt is the reason for typically high lead oxide content in the glass solders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Soda-lime</b> glass, {{also called}} soda-lime-silica glass, {{is the most}} {{prevalent}} type of glass, used for windowpanes and glass containers (bottles and jars) for beverages, food, and some commodity items. Glass bakeware is often made of tempered <b>soda-lime</b> glass. <b>Soda-lime</b> glass accounts for about 90% of manufactured glass.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most popular}} glass for {{lampworking}} is <b>soda-lime</b> glass, {{which is available}} pre-colored. <b>Soda-lime</b> glass is the traditional mix used in blown furnace glass, and lampworking glass rods were originally hand-drawn from the furnace and allowed to cool for use by lampworkers.

50|$|The European {{manufacturer}} of Pyrex, Arc International, uses borosilicate glass in its Pyrex glass kitchen products; however, the U.S. {{manufacturer of}} Pyrex kitchenware uses tempered <b>soda-lime</b> glass. Thus Pyrex {{can refer to}} either <b>soda-lime</b> glass or borosilicate glass when discussing kitchen glassware, while Pyrex, Bomex, Duran, TGI and Simax all refer to borosilicate glass when discussing laboratory glassware. The real difference is the trademark and the company that owns the Pyrex name. The original Corning ware made of borosilicate glass was trademarked in capital letters (PYREX). When the kitchenware division was sold, the trademark was changed to lowercase (pyrex) and switched to low thermal-expansion <b>soda-lime</b> glass. The scientific division of Pyrex has always been using borosilicate glass.|$|E
