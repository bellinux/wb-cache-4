40|$|Autonomous surface {{vehicles}} (ASVs) {{have proven}} effective as ocean observing platforms for maritime operations. In most cases it is advantageous to operate ASVs for extensive missions {{in order to}} maximize their cost effectiveness. Such long endurance missions require ASVs to be capable of scavenging ambient energy from the surrounding ocean environment. <b>Submerged</b> flapping <b>foils</b> are currently utilized as an effective mechanism to convert ocean wave energy directly into propulsion. The authors propose a novel setup whereby these foils can heave relative to the surface vehicle and, through the application of a power take off (PTO) system, can recover a proportion of the incoming wave energy. Experiments were performed to investigate the coupled response between a surface vehicle and <b>submerged</b> flapping <b>foils</b> within the context of generating power and propulsion from incoming waves onboard ASVs. Results show that the response of a surface vehicle with <b>submerged</b> flapping <b>foils</b> is particularly sensitive to design parameters such as the longitudinal location of the foils and the seakeeping characteristics of the surface vehicle.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{successful}} use of hydrofoil {{systems on}} catamarans, {{such as the}} Hysucat, {{led to the development}} of a similar <b>foil</b> <b>system</b> for a high speed trimaran. Firstly a mathematical model was developed to calculate the equilibrium planing conditions of a planing trimaran. This was then used in the hydrodynamic design of a fully planing trimaran with a design speed of 65 kn. The mathematical model was then modified to include the effects of added hydrofoils. This model was then used to design a hydrofoil support system for the planing trimaran. Towing tank tests were then performed on a scale model of the boat, with and without the supporting hydrofoil system. This was done to verify the theoretical design and to gather resistance data, which could then be compared to other boats. The results showed a notable improvement in efficiency of the boat with the addition of foils. The conclusion was made that with the addition of a well-designed <b>foil</b> <b>system,</b> hull efficiencies similar to that expected for the Hysucat, can be attained when the <b>foil</b> <b>system</b> is added to the trimaran. As this work was focused mainly on the high-speed performance of the boat, it is not certain how the boat will perform through the speed-range. It is therefore recommended that further testing be done, to determine the performance of the boat at lower speeds...|$|R

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of this paper}} stems from our recent study [Q. Xiao, K. Sun, H. Liu, J. X. Hu, Computational study on near wake interaction between undulation body and a D-section cylinder, Ocean Eng. 38 (2011) 673 – 683] which shows that, for a flow system with a D-sectional cylinder combined with an undulating NACA 0012 foil {{in the wake of}} a cylinder, cylinder drag force could be considerably reduced if the foil is properly placed in the cylinder wake. In this study, a further detailed parametric study on this coupled cylinder–undulating <b>foil</b> <b>system</b> is carried out by a numerical simulation. Particular interest is focused on how Reynolds number, the relative size of the foil to the cylinder, the foil undulating frequency, the wavelength and the gap between the cylinder and the foil affect the cylinder drag, lift force as well as foil thrust. For a range of flow and geometry parameters studied here, our results show that the maximum cylinder drag and the lift coefficient can be reduced as much as 57. 4 % and 63. 3 % as compared to the cylinder without the undulating foil. Foil thrust coefficient increases up to 4 times as compared to a single foil.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to develop and test {{techniques}} for the computational optimization of hydrofoil sections and lifting surfaces advancing under a free surface. A mathematical model was developed based on the extension of a two-dimensional potential flow solution to account for three dimensional effects. Prandtl's lifting line theory was used to account for induced drag and downwash {{at the leading edge}} of the foil. Strip theory was used to extend the two-dimensional wave drag solutions to three dimensions for high aspect ratio foils. A semi-empirical correction was added to account for viscous drag. The drag-to-lift ratio of foil sections and lifting surfaces were optimized using first order gradient techniques. Optimization studies involving <b>submerged</b> <b>foil</b> sections suggest that trading buoyancy for a reduction in wave drag will lead to optimal geometries. Difficulties encountered resulting from the adoption of a potential flow model were identified and discussed. The lifting surface optimization {{was carried out}} using the coefficients of Glauert's circulation series as design variables. At high speeds it was shown that non-elliptical loading can produce reductions in the drag-to-lift ratio of a lifting surface. Induced drag dominated the low-speed optimization, and elliptical loading was shown to be optimal at the low end of expected operating speeds of a hydrofoil vessel. An adjoint formulation for the problem of optimizing the shape of a lifting section under a free surface was derived for use in future research. by Gregory Michael Tozzi. Thesis (S. M.)
