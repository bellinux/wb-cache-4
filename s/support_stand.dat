The new stadium is built just between Bugibba and St. Paul's Bay as it is situated between the Coast Road highway and high-rise buildings of Bugibba. FIFA officially confirmed that the new Sirens Stadium can host competitive games from two local leagues, Maltese Third Division and the Maltese Second Division.

5000|$|After {{it became}} clear in late summer 2010 that the project of Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg to suspend {{conscription}} will be successful, the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs drafted a bill for the Federal voluntary service in the departmental co-ordination.

50|$|The MIA’s “The Doryphoros” is in {{very good}} condition, {{especially}} given {{the age of the}} work. All of the breaks in this replica are ancient, except for the left arm. The head has stayed intact. There are some deep scratches on the side and the marks that are on his cheeks and arms are from the roots of plants, which suggest that this copy had been buried for centuries. When it was found, it was in six pieces and has been reassembled. The sculpture has had some minimal restorations, for example “a steel pin has been inserted into the tree trunk that buttresses the right leg, and the sculpture has been reassembled from the six pieces in which it was found: the torso from head to knees, the two calves, the left foot, tree trunk and base, the right foot and base, and the area of the left arm surrounding the bend at the elbow” (Arts Connected). The tip of his nose has been broken off, along with his left forearm and hand, part of the right foot, the penis, and some of the digits of the fingers on the right hand. There is an indentation on his left hip, where the strut that ran to the left forearm has now broken away.

5000|$|There were {{originally}} five classifications in international competitions. In 1983, classification for shooters {{with cerebral palsy}} {{was done by the}} Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association. The classification used the classification system designed for field athletics events. In 1983, there were five cerebral palsy classifications for its competitors. Class 2 competitors could compete in co-ed division 1 Class 1 and Class 2 events with the use of assistance including a sling, trigger aid and <b>support</b> <b>stand.</b> [...] In 1983, Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA) set the eligibility rules for classification for this sport. They defined cerebral palsy as a non-progressive brain legion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them. The organization also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments. For their classification system, people with spina bifida were not eligible unless they had medical evidence of loco-motor dysfunction. People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance. Competitors with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthrogryposis were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres. [...] By the early 1990s, the shooting classification system had moved away from medical based system to a functional classification system. [...] Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles. The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research.|$|E

40|$|A don/doff <b>support</b> <b>stand</b> for {{use with}} rear entry space suits is disclosed. The <b>support</b> <b>stand</b> is {{designed}} for use in one-g environments; however, certain features of the stand {{can be used on}} future space-craft, lunar or planetary bases. The present invention has a retainer which receives a protruding lug fixed on the torso section of the space suit. When the lug is locked in the retainer, the space suit is held in a generally upright position. In a one-g environment a portable ladder is positioned adjacent to the rear entry of the space suit supported by the stand. The astronaut climbs up the ladder and grasps a hand bar assembly positioned above the rear entry. The astronaut then slips his legs through the open rear entry and down into the abdominal portion of the suit. The astronaut then lowers himself fully into the suit. The portable ladder is then removed and the astronaut can close the rear entry door. The lug is then disengaged from the retainer and the astronaut is free to engage in training exercises in the suit. When suit use is over, the astronaut returns to the stand and inserts the lug into the retainer. A technician repositions the ladder. The astronaut opens the rear entry door, grasps the hand bar assembly and does a chin-up to extricate himself from the suit. The astronaut climbs down the movable ladder while the suit is supported by the stand...|$|E
