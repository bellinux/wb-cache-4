5000|$|Network {{cloaking}} is {{an attempt}} to provide wireless security by hiding the network name (service set identifier) from being broadcast publicly. Many routers come with this option as a standard feature in the <b>setup</b> <b>menu</b> accessed via a web browser.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{professional}} VTRs can [...] "burn" [...] (overlay) {{the tape}} timecode {{onto one of}} their outputs. This output (which usually also displays the <b>setup</b> <b>menu</b> or on-screen display) {{is known as the}} super out or monitor out. The character switch or menu item turns this behaviour on or off. The character function is also used to display the timecode on the preview monitors in linear editing suites.|$|E
2500|$|Digital {{cameras and}} {{photographic}} software often use colour temperature in K in edit and <b>setup</b> <b>menus.</b> The simple guide {{is that the}} higher the colour temperature, the more white or blue the image will be. The reduction in colour temperature will give an image more dominated by reddish, [...] "warmer" [...] colours.|$|R
50|$|The {{multi-function}} display typically shows a moving map {{on the right}} side, and engine instrumentation on the left. Most of the other screens in the G1000 system are accessed by turning the knob on the lower {{right corner of the}} unit. Screens available from the MFD other than the map include the <b>setup</b> <b>menus,</b> information about nearest airports and NAVAIDs, Mode S traffic reports, terrain awareness, XM radio, flight plan programming, and GPS RAIM prediction.|$|R
5000|$|Since all inputs are {{processed}} though the Lifestyle 135 {{before reaching the}} television, it {{can act as a}} single point of control for the whole system (termed [...] "Unify" [...] by Bose) and <b>setup</b> <b>menus</b> can be displayed on the television. Also, [...] "BoseLink" [...] allows remotes for other equipment to control some functions of the Lifestyle 135 and vice versa. A microphone is included to help tune the system for the room acoustics (termed [...] "AdaptiQ" [...] by Bose), much like many home theatre receivers.|$|R
50|$|One feature {{allowed the}} viewer to move between the two {{different}} locations in the venue which he felt had the best sound: the front row, and behind the front-of-house console. Z7 Konzertfabrik supplied blueprints for the venue; Evans and mix engineer Rich Mouser (who had run front-of-house sound for the show) designed two surround mixes to simulate both listening positions. The audio <b>setup</b> <b>menu</b> on the DVD and Blu-ray versions showed the Z7 blueprint, and displayed the listener's current position.|$|E
50|$|The XH-A1S is {{a native}} HDV {{that is capable of}} {{recording}} 1080/24p, 1080/30p. When using the 1080/24p, or 1080/30p features, you should use the 24F (24 frame rate) or 30F (30 frame rate) mode in the Camera <b>Setup</b> <b>menu.</b> This camera is capable of shooting sports, television, music videos, commercials, and movies. (The 60 frame rate option is generally the best for sports.) Although this is a Video Camera, the 24F, or 24 frame rate option is usually the best option for replicating film. 24 frame rate is generally what is used when shooting Film.|$|E
50|$|Glest {{is set in}} {{a medieval}} fantasy world with two factions, named Magic and Tech, each with their own set of units, {{buildings}} and upgrades. The Tech faction uses traditional human warriors and has medieval mechanical devices in its arsenal, and are strong in melee combat. The Magic faction is designed for advanced players with most of their units morphed from or summoned by others. It lacks the hand-to-hand combat strength of the Tech faction but features more versatile units. Tilesets and maps are selected at the new game <b>setup</b> <b>menu</b> and determine the graphical nature of the Glest game world.|$|E
5000|$|The {{remote control}} {{has only a}} few buttons on it - Power, Input, Channel, Volume, Mute, and Back. The remote can {{function}} as a universal remote (including control of TiVo and iPod devices), with most controls shown on the TV screen. A microphone is included to help tune the system for the room acoustics (termed [...] "AdaptiQ" [...] by Bose), much like many home theatre receivers. The VideoWave {{can act as a}} single point of control for the whole system (termed [...] "Unify" [...] by Bose) and <b>setup</b> <b>menus</b> can be displayed on the television.|$|R
25|$|All {{functions}} can {{be invoked}} {{by both the}} mouse and shortcut keys, including game <b>setup,</b> the <b>menu</b> options and some gameplay functions including scrolling and pausing the game. Units and buildings can be selected by clicking or , and then their actions can be controlled by the mouse or keys.|$|R
50|$|The Box in {{its early}} life had {{numerous}} problems which have mostly been fixed by over the air updates. The most notable bug was the Fast Forward and Rewind bug fixed in version 3.59 which caused the box to forget its position in a recording and jump back to the beginning. The box is prone to freezing in standby {{for no apparent reason}} but control can be restored by power cycling the box. There is also a problem with the aspect ratio (AFD), where the aspect ratio does not automatically correct itself when switching from a 16:9 programme to a 4:3 programme and vice versa resulting in a stretched picture. This problem started with version 4.07 but was not addressed in the minor release 4.09. This can often be manually corrected by switching to standby and back or through the box <b>setup</b> <b>menus.</b> If not, then it can be corrected by altering the aspect ratio on the TV, rather than the box. It is widely believed that problems with the box {{is one of the main}} reasons why customers choose not to resubscribe after their first free month.|$|R
50|$|Many source devices do {{not have}} the ability to overlay CC information, for {{controlling}} the CC overlay can be complicated. For example, the Motorola DCT-5xxx and -6xxx cable set-top receivers have the ability to decode CC information located on the MPEG-2 stream and overlay it on the picture, but turning CC on and off requires turning off the unit and going into a special <b>setup</b> <b>menu</b> (it is not on the standard configuration menu and it cannot be controlled using the remote). Historically, DVD players, VCRs and set-top tuners did not need to do this overlaying, since they simply passed this information on to the TV, and they are not mandated to perform this overlaying.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to use FMS {{with nothing more than}} a keyboard, but anything more responsive than a trainer or slow flyer really needs analog control, such as a twin-stick gamepad controller or PC joystick. Many sources, including radio manufacturer Hitec, make cables to interface most brands of R/C transmitters with the program via the buddy box socket and a computer's USB, microphone or serial port. This adds realism as well as useful transmitter features like trims, dual rates and exponential. A limited amount of exponential can be selected in FMS's <b>setup</b> <b>menu,</b> however. Hitec's website markets their interface cable as a direct connection to FMS and includes a download link on their website.|$|E
50|$|MegaGlest {{is set in}} {{a fantasy}} world with seven factions: Magic, Tech, Indians, Egypt, Norsemen, Persian and Romans, which {{together}} form the Megapack. Each come with their own set of units, buildings and upgrades, advantages and disadvantages, which allows for variation in strategy while keeping a balanced gameplay. For example, the Tech faction uses traditional human warriors and has medieval mechanical devices in its arsenal, and are strong in melee combat while the Magic faction is designed for more advanced players with most of their units morphed from or summoned by others. Magic lacks the hand-to-hand combat strength of the Tech faction but features more versatile units. Tilesets are selected at the new game <b>setup</b> <b>menu</b> and determine the graphical nature of the MegaGlest game world. MegaGlest provides cross-platform online multiplayer LAN/Internet support.|$|E
50|$|Initially most of {{the main}} map and minimap are blacked out, but the visible area expands as the player's units explore the map. The fog of war {{completely}} hides all territory which the player's has not explored, and shows only terrain but hides opponents units and buildings if none of the player's units are present.All functions can be invoked by both the mouse and shortcut keys, including game <b>setup,</b> the <b>menu</b> options and some gameplay functions including scrolling and pausing the game. Units and buildings can be selected by clicking or , and then their actions can be controlled by the mouse or keys.|$|R
40|$|This thesis into {{analyzing}} the menu {{based on the}} customers need in catering business of Spandershoeve is written as a final assignment of the Hotel Management Program. Tfis research is writter in order to examine: The relationship between menu and customers need; how to adjust <b>menu</b> <b>setup</b> to the customers need; and how it contributes to expanding Rantangan, catering business of Spandershoeve.

5000|$|Famitsu {{gave it a}} {{score of}} two eights, one nine, and one eight {{for a total of}} 33 out of 40; the authors praised the game's controls, game play, and online mode, noting, [...] "it really feels like an online game in the palm of your hand." [...] The {{publication}} criticized the game's [...] "softness of the sound." [...] Nintendo Power gave good remarks towards the game, but heavily criticized the <b>menu</b> <b>setup</b> and the loss to change weapons during gameplay.

50|$|The Ur-Quan Masters (or UQM) project aims to port Star Control II {{to modern}} {{operating}} systems including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and BSD. The project began in 2002 {{when the original}} creators Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III released the source code of the 3DO version as open source under the GPL. Its latest version, 0.7.0, was released on 4 July 2011. The game media is only free to use in non-commercial context as it was released under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 2.5 license. It has also added the option of online multiplayer Melee play, something which was not available in the original game. A variety of modifications to the melee have been released by fans, including versions with superpowered ships and numerous planets. As of version 0.4, the long-missing intro and ending movies were finally added, as was an in-game <b>setup</b> <b>menu.</b> The ability to mod the game {{is one of the}} project's goals.|$|E
50|$|In {{the season}} mode, the player {{makes up the}} last name of his character. He must {{audition}} for a team and must qualify {{for all of his}} races on time. If the player fails to qualify for a race, he automatically receives zero points and sees a picture of himself looking at the night time sky. Each teams has requirements and if they are not met, then the player is fired from the racing team. Depending on how good a player qualifies in the test teack (known in the game as Auto Police), either many or few teams will be knocking on the player's metaphorical door. Different teams have different requirements in order to stay employed. Unlike its sequel F1 Super License: Nakajima Satoru, going to the pit stop is needed to do repairs on the car. Repairing the car can either be set to automatic or manual on the <b>setup</b> <b>menu.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this Bachelor Thesis {{is to find}} out whether parents and their {{children}} prefer a healthy and balanced diet. At present, when everyone is in a hurry and tries to make everything easier, the results are that we devote little time and attention to our diet and lifestyle in general. The proportion of frozen ready-made meals and the number of fast-foods increases, and many people do not have enough time when at home to prepare fresh meals for themselves. I am inclined to believe that proper eating habits remain during the rest of one?s life. I was therefore interested in how children eat after leaving the nursery school facilities. Being assisted by their parents, I monitored a selected group of children, focusing on their diets in their respective families. Further, I analysed with the parents their opinions on the <b>menu</b> <b>setup</b> in the nursery school. I interviewed children in the nursery school in a form of playing about which meals they preferred and what the term ?healthy diet? meant for them. The thesis conclusion evaluates the children?s eating habits...|$|R
