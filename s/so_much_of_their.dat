Gill was less complimentary, calling it [...] "Hello! history". [...] In an interview about the series for the Radio Times, Starkey complained that too many historians had focussed not on Henry, but on his wives. [...] Referring to a [...] "feminised history", he said: [...] "so many of the writers who write about this are women and <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> audience is a female audience."

The importance of Mulan and other non-white princesses {{can be seen in}} the 2009 study of the effects of children's cartoons on the body image of young girls by doctors Sharon Hayes and Stacey Tantleff-Dunn. The study revealed that in the group of girls ranging from 3 to 6 years old, 30.6% of the group would change their physical appearance if they could. Of these respondents, over half would change their hair and over a quarter would change something about their body, such as skin color. Of all girls surveyed, 8% said they would have to change their hair or skin color to become a princess, stating things like they would [...] "change from brown skin to white skin", for example. The interviewed group was predominantly white.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of radiocarbon dating {{has had a}} profound impact on archaeologyoften described as the [...] "radiocarbon revolution". [...] In the words of anthropologist R.E. Taylor, [...] " [...] data made a world prehistory possible by contributing a time scale that transcends local, regional and continental boundaries". It provides more accurate dating within sites than previous methods, which usually derived either from stratigraphy or from typologies (e.g. of stone tools or pottery); it also allows comparison and synchronization of events across great distances. The advent of radiocarbon dating may even have led to better field methods in archaeology, since better data recording leads to firmer association of objects with the samples to be tested. These improved field methods were sometimes motivated by attempts to prove that a [...] date was incorrect. Taylor also suggests that the availability of definite date information freed archaeologists from the need to focus <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> energy on determining the dates of their finds, and led to an expansion of the questions archaeologists were willing to research. For example, from the 1970s questions about the evolution of human behaviour were much more frequently seen in archaeology.|$|E

500|$|For casting Vanaja and Lacchi, he {{said that}} they met {{approximately}} 2500 children, interviewed about 260, and finally selected two from a shortlist of five to play the roles of Vanaja and Lacchi. Parents of these children were distrustful of them because their wards would have to frequently commute to Domalpalli's house for acting lessons for at least a year. Domalpalli felt that [...] "to convince people to devote <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> children's time and energy was hard enough, but to find the right combination of intelligence, commitment and talent as well was probably the steepest cliff they had to climb." [...] While visiting schools for identifying the child cast, Mamatha Bhukya at first was not selected because her hair was short. But after she sang a song on Mahatma Gandhi, she was selected for the role. Srinivas Devarakonda, a disciple of well-known Kuchipudi guru Vempati Chinna Satyam, taught Mamatha the classical dance form for a year in the basement of Domalpalli's house. Due to this sustained effort, she altered her ambitions from becoming a doctor to an actress and a Kuchipudi dancer. Bhavani Renukunta was chosen for Lacchi's role after an interview at the Hyderabad office of Varija Films, the company that handled the publicity.|$|E
500|$|Phantom Power {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics {{with a score}} of 87 on Metacritic, denoting [...] "universal acclaim". Drowned in Sound described the album as [...] "another fine, esoteric wonder of an LP", while the NME claimed it is the group's [...] "most focussed, energetic pop record since Radiator" [...] {{and went on to}} state that [...] "for a band to be hitting such form six albums into a steady career is astonishing". Q called it [...] "the band's best work to date, as accessible as it is inventive"; The Times agreed, calling Phantom Power [...] "the Furries’ most satisfying album to date ... one to cherish." [...] Several critics commented on the [...] "summery pop" [...] nature of the record with Tiny Mix Tapes likening the album to [...] "the sun shining through following a large and brooding thunderstorm" [...] and The Times calling it [...] "mellow summer listening" [...] despite the [...] "grim view of the world" [...] expressed in Gruff Rhys's lyrics. The NME found that Phantom Power compares favourably with the band's previous release, Rings Around the World, losing some of that album's mainstream polish. AllMusic agreed, expressing relief that the band had loosened up following Rings..., which the website described as [...] "often sounding constrained by its polished widescreen aspirations". Irish website entertainment.ie saw Phantom Power as [...] "a highly polished affair, filled with the widescreen classic pop that Gruff Rhys and co. carry off so effortlessly ... thankfully free of the techno experiments that marred <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> previous work".|$|E
2500|$|CDI {{triggered}} by {{two sets of}} points. A basic problem with the rotary engine design {{is a lack of}} engine braking, partially due to the mass of the rotor. Leaning of the mixture on overrun also contributes to erratic and [...] "lumpy" [...] running. One way to solve the problem is to shut off ignition entirely on overrun, but this leads to excessive contamination of the combustion chamber by unwanted deposits, which can cause the apex seals to stick. Suzuki opted for a compromise by using two sets of ignition points. One set of points ran on a dual lobe cam for normal operation, firing the rotor every face. The other set ran on a single cam on the same shaft for triggering the spark plug on overrun. The second set (the B points) were {{triggered by}} an rpm sensor (the speed relay) and a vacuum switch, which meant that they worked on engine deceleration (high vacuum) and above 1,700rpm. This system fired the rotor every second face. This kept the combustion chambers relatively clean. It also served to smooth the lumpy feel of the bike as RPM reduced on overrun and addressed some issues with backfiring (more correctly, [...] "afterfiring"). Engine braking is also significantly improved. The B point system was discontinued on the [...] "A". It is believed that the factory also employed mechanics to visit dealerships and disconnect the B points on any [...] "M" [...] (1975) models still in the showrooms. Suzuki {{toyed with the idea of}} two plugs like the Mazda's, but as with <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> engineering on this bike, overthought the application, believing that they would require two plugs of different heat ranges. The idea was dropped, and the bike shipped with a single 18mm conical seat gold palladium spark plug housed in a copper insert in the rotor housing (NGK A9EFV).|$|E

[...] But the Constable Bourbon, who was in command of the Imperial army was no longer in control of it, as he admitted in letters both to Lannoy and the Pope on 29 March. The Pope replied by sending a Nuncio, the Archbishop of Riga (1523-1531) Giovanni Blankenfeld, but Blankenfeld was unwilling to go beyond the security of Florence to meet the Germans and Spaniards. [...] The army continued its march south in the direction of Florence and Rome. [...] The Viceroy proceeded north to meet the Constable on 18 April, bringing with him some 80,000 ducats, which were being supplied by the Florentines. This was intended to buy time for the Florentines to gather their allies and prepare their defense. The Constable claimed that he needed three times that amount to satisfy the troops, who refused to halt their march, and actually nearly killed Lannoy. [...] He managed to escape and reached Siena on 25 April, where he was trapped during the critical {{days leading up to the}} Sack.
