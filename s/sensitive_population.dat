40|$|OBJECTIVE: Fish {{consumption}} advisories {{are issued}} {{to warn the}} public of possible toxicological threats from consuming certain fish species. Although developing fetuses and children are particularly susceptible to toxicants in fish, fish also contain valuable nutrients. Hence, formulating advice for <b>sensitive</b> <b>populations</b> poses challenges. We conducted a comparative analysis of advisory Web sites issued by states to assess health messages that <b>sensitive</b> <b>populations</b> might access. DATA SOURCES: We evaluated state advisories accessed via the National Listing of Fish Advisories issued by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. DATA EXTRACTION: We created criteria to evaluate advisory attributes such as risk and benefit message clarity. DATA SYNTHESIS: All 48 state advisories issued {{at the time of}} this analysis targeted children, 90 % (43) targeted pregnant women, and 58 % (28) targeted women of childbearing age. Only six advisories addressed single contaminants, while the remainder based advice on 2 â€“ 12 contaminants. Results revealed that advisories associated a dozen contaminants with specific adverse health effects. Beneficial health effects of any kind were specifically associated only with omega- 3 fatty acids found in fish. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the complexity of assessing and communicating information about multiple contaminant exposure from fish consumption. Communication regarding potential health benefits conferred by specific fish nutrients was minimal and focused primarily on omega- 3 fatty acids. This overview suggests some lessons learned and highlights a lack of both clarity and consistency in providing the breadth of information that <b>sensitive</b> <b>populations</b> such as pregnant women need to make public health decisions about fish consumption during pregnancy...|$|R

Patients with DM often suffer from obesity, hyperglycemia, altered fatty acids that contribute to vascular dysfunction, and increased risk to ischemia. Caenorhabditis elegans is a model system used to study the conserved insulin signaling pathway, cellular responses in whole organisms and the impact a glucose diet has on oxygen deprivation (anoxia) responses. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) was {{used to analyze the}} expression of genes in the anoxia <b>sensitive</b> <b>populations</b> of N 2 (wild-type) fed glucose and hyl- 2 (tm 2031), a mutant with altered ceramide metabolism. Comparison of the altered transcripts in the anoxia <b>sensitive</b> <b>populations</b> revealed 199 common transcripts- 192 upregulated and 7 downregulated. One of the gene families that have altered expression in the anoxia <b>sensitive</b> <b>populations</b> encode for Cytochrome P 450 (CYP). CYPs are located both in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but the CYPs of interest are all predicted to be mainly subcellularly localized to the ER. Here, I determined that knock-down of specific cyp genes, using RNA interference (RNAi), increased anoxia survival in N 2 animals fed a standard diet. Anoxia sensitivity of the hyl- 2 (tm 2031) animals was supressed by RNAi of cyp- 25 A 1 or cyp- 33 C 8 genes. These studies provide evidence that the CYP detoxification system impacts oxygen deprivation responses. using hsp- 4 ::GFP animals, a transcriptional reporter for ER unfolded protein response (UPR), I further investigated the impact of cyp knock-down, glucose, and anoxia on ER UPR due to the prediction of CYP- 33 C 8 localization to the ER. Glucose significantly increased ER UPR and cyp knock-down non-significantly increased ER UPR. Measurements of ER UPR due to anoxia were made difficult, but representative images show an increase in ER stress post 9 -hour anoxia exposure. This study provides evidence that glucose affects ER stress and that ER stress is involved in oxygen deprivation responses...|$|R

50|$|The Laguna Mountains skipper's {{population}} {{decline is}} credited mostly to habitat destruction. Having a single larval host plant makes reproduction difficult if a given Cleveland's horkelia (Horkelia clevelandii) population encounters environmental stochasticity http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb310/lecture-notes/small-populations/node7.html. Habitat destruction and degradation is primarily associated with urban and agricultural development {{as well as}} recreational activities. Most common degradation is affiliated with overgrazing and trampling of the Cleveland's horkelia (Horkelia clevelandii) by cattle leading to habitat fragmentation. Due to their small, <b>sensitive</b> <b>population</b> size, any manipulation/disturbance to skipper habitat has large impacts on skipper populations.

Furthermore, over collection of Laguna Mountains skipper populations by scientists pose as a potential threat to population size.|$|E

Shoot and root concentrations of Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, S and Zn were evaluated through ICP-OES. Results indicated that increasing the environmental Cu concentration had a population dependent effect on element profiles, shoot-to-root ratios and correlations among the elements. Generally, in the tolerant population Cu treatment induced a higher element accumulation in roots and had minimal {{effects on the}} shoot element profile, thus resulting in a progressively decreasing shoot-to-root ratio for each element. In the <b>sensitive</b> <b>population</b> element concentrations in root and shoot were much more affected and without a consistent trend. Copper treatment also affected {{the correlations between the}} elements, both in roots and shoots of the two populations, but more so in the <b>sensitive</b> <b>population</b> than in the tolerant one. Thus, Cu exposure strongly disturbed element homeostasis in the <b>sensitive</b> <b>population,</b> but barely or not in the tolerant one, probably mainly due to a higher capacity to maintain proper root functioning under Cu exposure in the latter. Differences in element profiles were also observed in the absence of toxic Cu exposure. These differences may reflect divergent population-specific adaptations to differential nutrient availability levels prevailing in the populationsâ€™ natural environments. There is no evidence of inherent side-effects of the Cu tolerance mechanism operating in the tolerant population...|$|E

In most cases, such a mutation will be associated with ecological fitness penalty under herbicide free environmental conditions. Here we describe the effect of various mutations, endowing resistance to acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors, on the ecological fitness penalty of Lolium rigidum populations. The TS resistant populations, MH (substitution of isoleucine 1781 to leucine) and NO (cysteine 2088 to arginine), were examined and compared to a <b>sensitive</b> <b>population</b> (AL). Grain weight (GW) characterization of individual plants from both MH and NO populations, showed that resistant individuals had significantly lower GW compared with sensitive ones.

Likewise, early vigor of plants from both TS resistant populations was significantly lower than the one measured in plants of the <b>sensitive</b> <b>population.</b> Under crop-weed intra-species competition, we found an opposite trend in the response of plants from different populations. Relatively to inter-population competition conditions, plants of MH population were less affected and presented higher reproduction abilities compared to plants from both AL and NO populations.

40|$|Amaranthus tuberculatus is a {{troublesome}} weed in {{corn and}} soybean production systems in Midwestern USA, {{due in part}} to its ability to evolve multiple resistance to key herbicides including 4 -hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). Here we have investigated the mechanism of resistance to mesotrione, an important chemical for managing broadleaf weeds in corn, in a multiple herbicide resistant population (NEB) from Nebraska. NEB showed a 2. 4 -fold and 45 -fold resistance increase to mesotrione compared to a standard <b>sensitive</b> <b>population</b> (SEN) in pre-emergence and post-emergence dose-response pot tests, respectively. Sequencing of the whole HPPD gene from 12 each of sensitive and resistant plants did not detect any target-site mutations that could be associated with post-emergence resistance to mesotrione in NEB. Resistance was not due to HPPD gene duplication or over-expression before or after herbicide treatment, as revealed by qPCR. Additionally, no difference in mesotrione uptake was detected between NEB and SEN. In contrast, higher levels of mesotrione metabolism via 4 -hydroxylation of the dione ring were observed in NEB compared to the <b>sensitive</b> <b>population.</b> Overall, the NEB population was characterised by lower levels of parent mesotrione exported {{to other parts of the}} plant, either as a consequence of metabolism in the treated leaves and/or impaired translocation of the herbicide.
