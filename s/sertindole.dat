METHOD: 617 patients were randomized, of whom 595 were included in an intention-to-treat analysis. 375 patients completed the study. Patients were randomized to receive <b>sertindole</b> 8 mg/day, <b>sertindole</b> 16 mg/day, <b>sertindole</b> 20 mg/day, <b>sertindole</b> 24 mg/day or haloperidol 10 mg/day for 56 days. Efficacy was assessed through the changes in score on the Positive ann Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale. Improvement in all end-points was observed for all treatment groups. RESULTS: <b>Sertindole</b> 16 mg showed significantly greater efficacy against negative symptoms than haloperidol 10 mg.

40|$|Abstract Background Use of the {{atypical}} antipsychotic <b>sertindole</b> {{was suspended}} for four years due to safety concerns. During the suspension, the regulatory authorities required further studies, including this one, to be conducted. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if a subset of patients with psychotic illness exists which particularly benefits from <b>sertindole</b> treatment after failure of other antipsychotic drugs, including atypical antipsychotics. Methods This was a retrospective single-arm observational crossover study of 344 patients, who served as their own controls. Patients mainly from the <b>Sertindole</b> Safety Study who had shown good response to <b>sertindole,</b> and who had followed up to four alternating six month periods of treatment with <b>sertindole</b> and other antipsychotics, were included. (In Period 1 patients took non-sertindole treatment, in Period 2, <b>sertindole</b> was taken, in Period 3, patients reverted to non-sertindole treatment, and in Period 4, <b>sertindole</b> was taken again.) Patient records for each period of treatment were assessed for objective data: number and duration of hospitalizations due to worsening of psychotic symptoms; the amount of self-harming behaviour; indicators of social status. Retrospective evaluation of changes in clinical symptoms from the patients' records was also conducted. Dates and reasons for stopping and/or switching medication were also recorded. Results There was improvement in all objective measured parameters during the periods of <b>sertindole</b> treatment. In particular, the average number of hospitalizations per year due to worsening of psychotic symptoms was reduced in the following way in the group studied over four treatment periods: Period 1 (non-sertindole treatment) 3. 4; Period 2 (<b>sertindole</b> treatment) 1. 0; Period 3 (non-sertindole treatment) 2. 0; Period 4 (<b>sertindole</b> treatment) 1. 8. The duration of hospitalizations also decreased significantly during the periods of <b>sertindole</b> treatment. Results showed that patients improved in objective social parameters when switched to <b>sertindole</b> treatment; assessment of the patients' affective lives showed a significant increase in the number of patients having a stable relationship during <b>sertindole</b> treatment; and assessment of the number of patients employed showed an increase after the first and second switch to <b>sertindole</b> treatment (from Period 1 to Period 2 and from Period 3 to Period 4, respectively). Adverse events and lack of efficacy were the main reasons for switching to <b>sertindole.</b> Conclusion A group of patients benefited from <b>sertindole</b> after other antipsychotic treatments, including that with atypical antipsychotics, had failed.

40|$|<b>Sertindole</b> is an {{antipsychotic}} drug with affinity for dopamine D, serotonin 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 C, and alpha(1) -adrenoreceptors. Preclinical {{studies suggest that}} <b>sertindole</b> acts preferentially on limbic and cortical dopaminergic neurons and clinical trials have confirmed that <b>sertindole</b> is effective at a low cloparnine D- 2 occupancy level. The active substance has a long half-life. Oral administration once daily yields highly stable plasma levels. These features may explain the clinically observed low frequency of extrapyramidal side effects, including tardive dyskinesia. In contrast to most antipsychotics, <b>sertindole</b> seems to be void of sedative effects. However, although not strictly proven by objective neuropsychological tests, this asset of <b>sertindole</b> does not add to the cognitive problems inherent in schizophrenia. Administration of <b>sertindole</b> is more often associated with prolongation of QTc compared with most other currently used antipsychotics. However, large cohort analyses do not suggest that all-cause mortality is higher with <b>sertindole</b> than with, for example, risperidone or olanzapine. The effective antipsychotic dose range of <b>sertindole</b> is 12 - 20 mg/day, with small variations among patients. The frequency of most adverse events, for example extrapyramidal symptoms and somnolence, with such a dose does not differ from placebo. Three side effects have been more common than with placebo/haloperidol in short-term studies: weight gain, rinithis and a decreased ejaculation volume. Two head-to-head comparisons (one in treatment-resistant patients) of <b>sertindole</b> and risperidone showed equivalent effects on positive symptoms. For negative symptoms, one study obtained equivalent effects and one a superior effect of <b>sertindole.</b> <b>Sertindole</b> {{should not be used}} as first-line treatment for first-episode patients with schizophrenia because of the QTc prolongation.

40|$|Abstract Background After sertindole's suspension, health {{authorities}} established a specific named-patient use (NPU) programme {{in order to}} supply <b>sertindole</b> to patients who {{did not respond to}} or did not tolerate alternative treatments. This programme provided the possibility of prospectively following an exhaustive cohort of patients treated with <b>sertindole</b> after its suspension. A survey was performed to assess sertindole's modalities of prescription, assess and document any serious adverse events (SAEs), and assess the mortality rate within the NPU cohort. Methods The study comprised a survey of sertindole-treated patients in eleven European countries. All patients treated with <b>sertindole</b> within the NPU programme were eligible for the study. Results 1, 432 patients were included in the study. The reason for <b>sertindole</b> prescription was lack of efficacy (approximately 50 %) or adverse events (approximately 20 %) of other antipsychotic treatments. The mean <b>sertindole</b> dose was 13. 4 mg daily. Lack of efficacy and adverse events were reported as reasons for <b>sertindole</b> discontinuation. A total of 97 SAEs were recorded, including ten fatal outcomes, which occurred during the study period or within thirty days after <b>sertindole</b> discontinuation. The all-cause mortality rate was 0. 51 per 100 Person-Years of Exposure (95 % Poisson confidence interval: 0. 23 – 0. 97). QTc prolongation was reported in 15 patients (1. 05 % of total patients), being a rate of 0. 85 per 100 Person-Years of Exposure [95 % CI: 0. 48 – 1. 41].

40|$|<b>Sertindole</b> (Serdolect), an {{atypical}} antipsychotic, was voluntarily {{suspended in}} the European Union in 1998 following regulatory concerns over reports of serious cardiac dysrhythmias and sudden unexpected deaths. The reported causes of death, their frequency, prolongation of the rate corrected QT interval (QTc) and cardiac dysrhythmias in patients prescribed <b>sertindole</b> were compared with those for patients treated with two other atypical antipsychotics. All patients in England, prescribed atypical antipsychotics by general practitioners during each drug's immediate post-marketing period, were identified using an observational cohort technique, prescription-event monitoring. Mortality rates in the <b>sertindole</b> cohort were compared with those in a comparator cohort using standardized mortality ratios and incidence rate ratios. Cardiovascular events were reviewed and followed up to identify cases of prolongation of QTc interval. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in mortality rates between <b>sertindole</b> and the comparator cohort, although confidence intervals (CI) were wide due to small numbers in the <b>sertindole</b> cohort. A much smaller number of patients were prescribed <b>sertindole</b> than the other antipsychotics. Six cases of prolongation of QTc interval were identified in 462 patients (1. 3 %, 95 % CI 0. 5 - 2. 8) treated with <b>sertindole</b> and one with unspecified electrocardiogram changes in the comparator cohort of 16 542 patients. This study contributes {{to the understanding of the}} occurrence of prolongation of QTc interval during clinical use of <b>sertindole,</b> the incidence of which was similar to that in clinical trials.

40|$|The {{safety and}} {{efficacy}} of <b>sertindole</b> have been established in three double-blind randomized controlled studies conducted in the United States, North America and Europe. In these three studies the tendency for <b>sertindole</b> to cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), a critical factor affecting compliance, was investigated. At 12 - 24 mg/day, <b>sertindole</b> was associated with placebo levels of EPS, which were significantly lower than for all doses of haloperidol. In the European study, 24 mg <b>sertindole</b> demonstrated slightly, but statistically significantly, more EPS than 8 mg (P = 0. 05). However, the incidence of EPS-related events was comparable with that reported for placebo in the United States and North American studies. The frequency of use of anti-EPS medication was also comparable in the <b>sertindole</b> and placebo groups. Slight prolongation of the Q-T interval was seen with <b>sertindole</b> in early clinical trials. Although no patients reported any clinical problems related to Q-T prolongation in these three studies, its use is contraindicated in patients suffering from underlying cardiac diseases or hypokalaemia and in those patients undergoing concomitant treatment with other medication known to prolong the Q-T interval.

40|$|Objective: This multicenter, double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} study {{evaluated the}} efficacy {{and safety of}} three doses of <b>sertindole</b> (12, 20, and 24 mg/day) and haloperidol (4, 8, and 16 mg/day) {{in the treatment of}} psychotic symptoms for 497 hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Method: The patients were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the medication groups and received treatment for 8 weeks. Changes in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and Clinical Global Impression scores were used as evaluations of treatment efficacy. Three rating scales were used to assess extrapyramidal symptoms as well as the occurrence of adverse events and the use of medications related to extrapyramidal symptoms. Results: Both <b>sertindole</b> and haloperidol were comparably effective in the treatment of psychosis, and all dose levels were significantly more effective than placebo.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Atypical {{antipsychotics}} {{have similar}} clinical efficacy {{in the treatment}} of schizophrenia; variability in their tolerability represents the discerning factor in treatment choices. <b>Sertindole</b> has a relatively good tolerability profile that favours long-term patient adherence and, therefore, is associated with lower rates of relapse and rehospitalization. AIM: A model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of a 5 -year treatment strategy starting with <b>sertindole</b> versus olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole or the typical antipsychotic agent, haloperidol. METHODS: The model was based on published trials and local clinical practice, and considered costs {{from the perspective of the}} Swedish National Health Insurance Board. RESULTS: All atypical agents were clinically superior and more cost-effective than haloperidol with a cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of approximately 490, 000 Swedish kroner. <b>Sertindole</b> was associated with the lowest direct and indirect medical costs, driven by its tolerability profile. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Sertindole</b> represents a useful alternative to the current treatment options available in Sweden.

40|$|RATIONALE: A {{pivotal role}} for {{glutamate}} in the pathophysiology {{and treatment of}} schizophrenia has been suggested. Few reports have investigated the impact of antipsychotics on postsynaptic density (PSD) molecules involved in glutamatergic transmission and synaptic remodeling. Homer is a key PSD molecule putatively implicated in schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: We studied the effect, in acute and chronic paradigms, of a first and a second generation antipsychotic (haloperidol and <b>sertindole,</b> respectively) on the expression of Homer 1 a and Homer-interacting PSD molecules. RESULTS: In the acute paradigm, Homer 1 a expression was induced by haloperidol but not <b>sertindole</b> in the striatum, consistent with the less propensity of <b>sertindole</b> to affect nigrostriatal neurotransmission. The profile of expression of two other inducible genes, Ania 3 and Arc, was highly similar to Homer 1 a. In the cortex, haloperidol reduced Homer 1 a and induced Ania 3. In the chronic paradigm, striatal expression of Homer 1 a and Ania 3 resembled that observed in the acute paradigm. In the cortex, haloperidol induced Homer 1 a, while <b>sertindole</b> did not. Homer 1 b expression was increased by haloperidol in the striatum and cortex whereas <b>sertindole</b> selectively induced Homer 1 b in the cortex. The expression of mGluR 5 was increased by both antipsychotics. A modulation by haloperidol was also seen for PSD- 95 and αCaMKII. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that haloperidol and <b>sertindole</b> may significantly modulate glutamatergic transcripts of the postsynaptic density. <b>Sertindole</b> induces constitutive genes in the cortex predominantly, which may correlate with its propensity to improve cognitive functions. Haloperidol preferentially modulates gene expression in the striatum, consistent with its action at nigrostriatal projections and its propensity to give motor side effects...|$|E

It is possible to use solution systems like ethanol-water- 25 % ammonia solution (8 : 1 : 1), toluolacetone-ethanol- 25 % ammonia solution (45 : 45 : 7. 5 : 2. 5), dioxan-chloroform-acetone- 25 % ammonia solution (47. 5 : 45 : 5 : 2. 5) for preliminary examination of atypical neuroleptic agents under study in combination with typical neuroleptics and tranquilizers with undirected analysis (general screening). System of solvents ethyl-acetate-chloroform- 25 % ammonia solution (85 : 10 : 5) is recommended to use for individual screening of risperidone, <b>sertindole,</b> olanzapine, haloperidol, benzol-ethanol- 25 % ammonia solution (50 : 10 : 0. 5) system to use for clozapine, <b>sertindole,</b> olanzapine. Ethanol- 25 % ammonia solution (100 : 1. 5) system is reasonable to use for chromatographic clearance of extracts from biological substances under study. We recommend using HPLC method and UV spectrophotometry for carrying out of a principal examination of clozapine, risperidone, <b>sertindole,</b> olanzapine and aripiprazole in case one of the substances under study is determined in the object. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the in vivo occupation of dopamine D 1, D 2 and serotonin (5 -HT) 2 A receptors by novel antipsychotic agent <b>sertindole</b> using N-ethoxycarbonyl- 2 -ethoxy- 1, 2 -dihydroquinoline (EEDQ), an irreversible antagonist at these receptor sites. DESIGN: Animal study. INTERVENTIONS: Intraperitoneal administration to Wistar rats of 1 of 4 test compounds: a control compound of 0. 15 % tartaric acid, or {{a compound of}} either <b>sertindole</b> (0. 5 mg/kg or 2. 0 mg/kg) or clozapine (20 mg/kg) dissolved in 0. 15 % tartaric acid 1 hour before intraperitoneal administration of EEDQ (8 mg/kg) or ethanol/water solution. RESULTS: <b>Sertindole</b> exhibited little or no effect on D 1 and D 2 binding sites in vivo. On the other hand, <b>sertindole</b> occupied 5 -HT 2 A receptors more extensively and firmly than EEDQ. This study indicates that <b>sertindole</b> is characterized by high occupancy of 5 -HT 2 A receptors and by low or minimum occupancy of D 1 and D 2 receptors. CONCLUSIONS: These characteristics {{are very similar to}} atypical antipsychotic agents such as clozapine. Sertindole's low liability to cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) may be related to greater long-term binding for 5 -HT 2 A receptors relative to D 2 receptors...|$|E
