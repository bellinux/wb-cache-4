But today <b>semantic</b> <b>web</b> <b>technologies</b> are rarely {{used in the}} {{software development}}, even though the additional use of these technologies could improve the software development process. One reason for the rare use of these technologies in the software development is that <b>semantic</b> <b>web</b> <b>technologies</b> are barely integrated with the established software development tools.

The <b>semantic</b> <b>web</b> <b>technology</b> stack of the W3C is offering SPARQL to formulate semantic queries in a syntax similar to SQL.

40|$|Abstract. To date, <b>Semantic</b> <b>Web</b> {{research}} {{has tended to}} focus on data modelling challenges, at the expense of software architecture and engineering issues. Our empirical analysis shows that implementing <b>Semantic</b> <b>Web</b> <b>technologies</b> creates challenges which can affect the whole application. Standard solutions and best practices for <b>Semantic</b> <b>Web</b> <b>technologies</b> are just emerging. The lack of these has been an obstacle for implementing and deploying applications which exploit <b>Semantic</b> <b>Web</b> <b>technologies</b> for real world use cases. In this paper we conduct an empirical survey of <b>Semantic</b> <b>Web</b> applications. We use this empirical data to propose a reference architecture for <b>Semantic</b> <b>Web</b> applications, and to identify the four main challenges for implementing the most common functionality related to <b>Semantic</b> <b>Web</b> <b>technologies</b> from a software engineering perspective: (i) the issues involved in integrating noisy and heterogeneous data, (ii) the mismatch of data models and APIs between components, (iii) immature and belated best practices and standards, and (iv) the distribution of application logic across components. We describe two orthogonal approaches for mitigating these challenges: (a) simplifying the application architecture by delegating generic functionality to external service providers, and (b) assembling and customising of components provided by software frameworks for rapid development of complete applications. ...|$|R
