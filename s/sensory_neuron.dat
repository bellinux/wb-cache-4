These connections provide the {{structure for the}} neural circuits that underlie reflexes. There are several types of reflex circuits, the simplest of which consists of a single synapse between a <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron</b> and a α-MNs.

25|$|While {{working in}} London {{in the early}} 1970s with John R. Vane (Nobel prize in Medicine, 1983), he participated in the {{discovery}} of the inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins by aspirin-like drugs. At that time, he proposed that the mechanism of the analgesic action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was due to the prevention of pain receptor sensitization which results from an inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins. This hypothesis was supported by further work from his laboratory and from many other investigators. His studies on the basic mechanisms involved in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia led to the discovery that a select class of analgesics like metamizole, in contrast to the classical NSAIDs, are able to counteract the ongoing sensitization of the primary <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron</b> via the stimulation of the arginine/nitric oxide pathway. He recently (December 2008) characterized a phenomenon described as retrograde sensitization of the primary <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron,</b> which emphasizes the importance of the peripheral component of the inflammatory pain. His group made a relevant contribution to the role of bradykinin and of cytokines in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia. He found that among the cytokines, interleukin 1b mediates the endogenous release of prostaglandins and IL-8 is responsible {{for the development of the}} sympathetic hyperalgesia. In this area he described an antagonist of IL-1 that is now being developed as a model for a new class of analgesics.|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} in the neural {{plasticity}} underlying neuropathic pain is altered gene expression in sensory dorsal root ganglia neurons. Injury to sensory nerves induces neurochemical, physiological and anatomical modifications to afferent and central neurons, such as afferent terminal sprouting and inhibitory interneuron loss. Following nerve damage, NaCl channel accumulation causes hyperexcitability, and downregulation of the TTX-resistant Nav1.8 (<b>sensory</b> <b>neuron</b> specific, SNS1) channel and upregulation of TTX-sensitive Nav1.3 (brain type III) and TRPV1 channels. These changes contribute to increased NMDA glutamate receptor-dependent excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons and are restricted to the ipsilateral (injured) side. A combination of these factors could contribute to the neuropathic pain state of postherpetic neuralgia.|$|E

Different observations and experiments on modulat ion in s iphon and tail <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> together contribute to the working model of mechanisms of learning and memory in Aplysia, yet no direct comparison of modulat ion in these two classes of <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> has yet been made. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to directly compare modulat ion between siphon and tail <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> in the same experimental conditions. In particular, we focused on the effects of serotonin on two firing properties of sensory neurons: spike duration and excitability. We appUed serotonin (5 -HT) onto both siphon and tail <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> under the same conditions and found that both spike duration and excitability were significantly enhanced. This enhancement was statistically indistinguishable between siphon and tail <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> tested simultaneously in the same preparation. Thus, these two different classes of <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> respond to 5 -HT in very similar, if not identical, ways.

40|$|Although feeding in Aplysia is {{mediated}} by a {{central pattern generator}} (CPG), the activity of this CPG is modified by afferent input. To determine how afferent activity produces the widespread changes in motor programs that are necessary if behavior is to be modified, we have studied two classes of feeding <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons.</b> We have shown that afferent-induced changes in activity are widespread because <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> make a number of synaptic connections. For example, <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> make monosynaptic excitatory connections with feeding motor neurons. Sensori-motor transmission is, however, regulated so that changes in the periphery do not disrupt ongoing activity. This results {{from the fact that}} <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> are also electrically coupled to feeding interneurons. During motor programs <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> are, therefore, rhythmically depolarized via central input. These changes in membrane potential profoundly affect sensori-motor transmission. For example, changes in membrane potential alter spike propagation in <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> so that spikes are only actively transmitted to particular output regions when it is behaviorally appropriate. To summarize, afferent activity alters motor output because <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> make direct contact with motor neurons. Sensori-motor transmission is, however, centrally regulated so that changes in the periphery alter motor programs in a phase-dependent manner...|$|R
25|$|Satellite glial {{cells in}} sensory ganglia are laminar cells that most often an {{envelope}} of multiple SGCs completely surrounds each <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron.</b> The number of SGCs {{that make up}} the sheath increases proportionately with the volume of the neuron which it surrounds. Additionally, the volume of the sheath itself increases proportionately with the volume and surface area of the neuron’s somata. The distance of extracellular space between the sheath and the neuronal plasma membrane measures , allowing the neuron and its SGC sheath to form a single anatomical and functional unit. These individual units are separated by areas of connective tissue. However, there are some sensory neurons that occupy the same space within connective tissue and are therefore grouped together in a “cluster” of two or three neurons. Most often each individual neuron in a cluster is still surrounded by its own SGC sheath, but in some cases it is missing. Some sensory neurons have small projections called microvilli that extend outward from their cell surfaces. Due to their close proximity to the SGC sheath, these microvilli of the neuronal plasma membrane reach into the grooves of the sheath, allowing for possible exchange of materials between the cells.|$|E

However, it remains unknown whether RhoA is actually required for any axon guidance events in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. To date, the physiological function of RhoA in axon guidance has not yet to be determined genetically in animals. Here we show that RhoA mRNA is strongly expressed by <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> in the dorsal root ganglia during mouse embryogenesis. We have deleted RhoA in <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> of the dorsal root ganglia using RhoA-floxed mice under the Wnt 1 -Cre driver in which Cre is strongly expressed in <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons.</b> Peripheral projections of <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> appear normal and there are no detectable defects in the central projections of both cutaneous and proprioceptive <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> in RhoAf/f; Wnt 1 -Cre mice. Furthermore, a co-culture assay using control or RhoA-deficient dorsal root ganglia explants and 293 T cells expressing semaphorin 3 A reveals that RhoA is not required for semaphorin 3 A-mediated axonal repulsion of <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons.</b> Expression of RhoC, a closely related family member, is increased in RhoA-deficient <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> and may play a compensatory role in this context.

In this study, we describe an in vitro system that enables the expression of exogenous odorant receptors in cultured olfactory <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons.</b> Olfactory <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> in the culture express characteristic signaling molecules and, therefore, provide a system to study receptor function within its intrinsic cellular environment. Results We demonstrate that cultured olfactory <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> express endogenous odorant receptors. Lentiviral vector-mediated gene transfer enables successful ectopic expression of odorant receptors. We show that the ectopically expressed mouse I 7 is functional in the cultured olfactory <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons.</b> When two different odorant receptors are ectopically expressed simultaneously, both receptor proteins co-localized in the same olfactory <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> up to 10 days in vitro.

To study synapses in the peripheral nervous system, Eccles and colleagues used the stretch reflex as a model. This reflex is easily studied because it consists of only two neurons: a <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron</b> (the muscle spindle fibre) and the motor neuron. The <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron</b> synapses onto the motor neuron in the spinal cord. When Eccles passed a current into the <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron</b> in the quadriceps, the motor neuron innervating the quadriceps produced a small excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). When he passed the same current through the hamstring, the opposing muscle to the quadriceps, he saw an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in the quadriceps motor neuron. Although a single EPSP {{was not enough to}} fire an action potential in the motor neuron, the sum of several EPSPs from multiple sensory neurons synapsing onto the motor neuron could cause the motor neuron to fire, thus contracting the quadriceps. On the other hand, IPSPs could subtract from this sum of EPSPs, preventing the motor neuron from firing.|$|E

Our first aim was to define the chemical classes of bladder <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> that express receptors for the endogenous modulators of nociceptor sensitivity, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), the related neurotrophic factor, artemin, and estrogens. Bladder <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> of adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were identified with retrograde tracer.
