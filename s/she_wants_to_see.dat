25|$|After being {{reunited with}} old colleagues like Klein, Clem and Oscar, Judith becomes obsessed with freeing Celestine from her prison below Roxborough Tower. She and Oscar {{eventually}} head to Roxborough Tower {{after all of}} the Tabula Rasa end up being killed. When they split up, Oscar ends up getting attacked by Dowd (still alive, with pieces from the Pivot shoved into his body), who slices him up much {{in the same way}} that Oscar did to him near the start of the book. Judith arrives just as Oscar dies. After speaking with Dowd, Judith returns to the basement of the tower and frees Celestine, who then fights and defeats Dowd. Celestine tells Judith that <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Maestro Sartori. Clem one night while helping the homeless finds Gentle and helps him get his senses back. Gentle heads off with him, and Monday tags along. Sartori meanwhile reveals to Judith (who still thinks he's Gentle) that he has impregnated her when she tries to get him to see Celestine. Judith tells him to go see Celestine. The real Gentle arrives shortly afterwards with Clem and Monday, and they head to Roxborough Tower, where Sartori has already met Celestine, who reveals that he was the child she bore when she was raped by Hapexamendios hundreds of years before. Gentle and Sartori do battle while the others help Celestine out of the tower.|$|E

500|$|Dot {{receives}} {{a visit from}} Dotty's mother Sandy. Dot assumes she is from Social Services, but Sandy says she is looking for her daughter Kirsty. Dot says she knows nobody of that name, but when she sees a photo she realises that it is Dotty. Dot hides Sandy's visit from Dotty, but later talks to Sandy about her daughter and her past. She also asks Dotty about the friends and family she used to have, but Dotty says Dot is the only family she needs. However, she soon admits that she misses her mother, and Dot reveals that she is alive and Nick had lied to her. Dotty says <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her mother, so Dot calls her. When Sandy arrives, Dotty is delighted and Dot tells Dotty she should go with Sandy. They say an emotional goodbye, and Dot says she can visit at any time.

2500|$|It is Kitty, Laura's neighbour. Laura is {{panicked and}} excited. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Kitty {{but she is}} unprepared, looking too much, she believes, like [...] "the woman of sorrows". Kitty is invited in. She fits {{effortlessly}} and confidently into this post-war world of domestication, {{she seems to have}} it all. She notices Laura's amateur efforts at making a cake, just what Laura was dreading. Laura recognises her inability to fit into this domestic world, but also her inability not to care -she is trapped between two worlds. She also recognises, however, that Kitty does not have the perfect world her confidence implies. For example, Kitty has remained barren despite her desire to have children. On the other hand, the one thing Laura seems to be excelling at in the domestic sphere is producing progeny.|$|E

Peter, Walter and Bell use LSD to go into Olivia's mind to locate and save her, but Bell is lost forever when he helps Olivia come to grips with her hidden fears and she regains consciousness. Olivia and Peter are soon caught up in Walternet's scheme to destroy their world using the doomsday machine and Olivia tells Peter she loves him before he steps into the [...] machine to stop it.|$|E
2500|$|In another {{article by}} Lemmon, {{published}} in The Atlantic in April 2013, the Hillary Doctrine is again elucidated. Lemmon cites a speech given by Clinton to the Women in the World Summit soon {{after leaving the}} State Department in which she reflects upon the case she made for women's rights {{in the past and}} argues that [...] "too many otherwise thoughtful people continue to see the fortunes of women and girls as somehow separate from society at large." [...] Further, Clinton explains how extremists rely upon this ignorance to keep women from being liberated, and, with that, also bar entire societies from liberation. However, rather than speaking in purely abstract terms of [...] "extremists" [...] and [...] "societies", Clinton concretely identifies some countries that <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> treat their women better, namely: Egypt, Pakistan, India, and at a different level, the United States itself. To conclude, Lemmon speculates whether the Hillary Doctrine will be transformed into a political platform upon which Clinton can run for President in 2015. However, regardless of speculation on Clinton's actions in the future, for now, the Hillary Doctrine stands as an important contribution to national security discussions around the world.|$|E
