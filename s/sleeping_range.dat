Groups that have more than three females split into smaller groups. Adult males live separately from females and only join when the latter is in estrus. [...] Males groups number up to 19 individuals who are not related and are not agonistic. Within a male group, 4-5 males may form temporary subgroups that change size and members each day. Females groups live in separate burrow clusters. A female group’s home range is ca.

Male group live in home ranges envelop those of several female groups and average [...] Within a female group, members use the same feeding and <b>sleeping</b> <b>ranges.</b> No dominance hierarchy exists between them. Male groups, by contrast, have live in ages-based linear hierarchies. Competition between males usually take the form of leaping displays that cause no injuries. In addition, males groups are not territorial like female groups are, and membership are very open. [...] During estrous, a female will be approached, solicited and chased by males trying to mate with her. The most dominant males get the first matings. A female will mate with the same male several times. If a male has not yet mated with a female, he will disrupt the copulations she has with other males. However, mate guarding is rare.|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} construct age specific reference ranges for respiratory rate. Respiratory rate in children attending childcare centres, kindergartens, and schools was measured using a nasal thermocouple to obtain respiratory waveforms. Reference ranges were constructed using data from 293 awake children between 12 and 84 months, and from 123 sleeping children between 12 and 60 months. The mean respiratory rate declined with increasing age and was significantly lower, with lower variability, during sleep than wakefulness.

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{daily total}} energy expenditure (TEE) using a physical activity monitor, combined with dietary assessment of energy intake {{to assess the}} relationship between daily energy expenditure and patterns of activity with energy intake in people with dementia living in care homes. Design and setting: A cross-sectional study in care homes in the UK. Participants: Twenty residents with confirmed dementia diagnosis were recruited from two care homes that specialised in dementia care. Measurements: A physical activity monitor (SensewearTM Armband, Body Media, Pittsburgh, PA) was employed to objectively determine total energy expenditure, sleep duration and physical activity. The armband was placed around the left upper triceps for up to 7 days. Energy intake was determined by weighing all food and drink items over 4 days (3 weekdays and 1 weekend day) including measurements of food wastage. Results: The mean age was 78. 7 (SD ± 11. 8) years, Body Mass Index (BMI) 23. 0 (SD ± 4. 2) kg/m 2; 50 % were women. Energy intake (mean 7. 4; SD ± 2. 6) MJ/d) was correlated with TEE (mean 7. 6; SD ± 1. 8 MJ/d; r= 0. 49, p< 0. 05). Duration of <b>sleeping</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 4 - 12. 5 (mean 6. 1) hrs/d and time spent lying down was 1. 3 - 16. 0 (8. 3) hrs/d. On average residents spent 17. 9 (6. 3 - 23. 4) hrs/d undertaking sedentary activity. TEE was correlated with BMI (r= 0. 52, p< 0. 05) and body weight (r= 0. 81, p< 0. 001) but inversely related to sleep duration (r=- 0. 59, p< 0. 01) and time lying down (r=- 0. 62, p< 0. 01). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that after taking BMI, sleep duration and time spent lying down into account, TEE was no longer correlated with energy intake. Conclusions: The results show {{the extent to which}} body mass, variable activity and sleep patterns may be contributing to TEE and together with reduced energy intake, energy requirements were not satisfied. Thus wearable technology has the potential to offer realtime monitoring to provide appropriate nutrition management that is more person-centred to prevent weight loss in dementia...|$|R
40|$|Project DescriptionUnexplained {{weight loss}} is {{frequently}} observed in dementia leading to further cognitive decline, frailty and disability. Apparent mechanisms {{that could lead}} to weight loss (lower energy intake and/or higher expenditure) remain unresolved and may be different in the various stages and types of dementia. During the progression of the illness, the extent to which altered sleep duration and variable physical activity patterns (intermittent or constant pacing/lying down) could affect weight loss is unknown. We have used an innovative light weight physical activity monitor (Sensewear TM Armband, Body Media, Pittsburgh, PA) to objectively determine total energy expenditure (TEE), sleep duration, physical activity and number of steps in people with dementia living in care homes. The armband was placed around the left upper triceps for up to 7 days. The device measures tri-axial acceleration, skin temperature, galvanic skin response and heat flux and {{has been shown to be}} valid in resting, exercise and free-living conditions in older people. The mean age of the residents (n= 20) was 78. 5 (58 - 99) years, 50 % were women with confirmed diagnosis of a range of dementia types. Body Mass Index (BMI) was 23. 0 (range 13. 7 - 30. 0) kg/m 2 with 40 % classified as underweight, 50 % normal range, 10 % overweight. Duration of <b>sleeping</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 4 - 12. 5 (mean 5. 9) hrs/d and time spent lying down was 1. 0 - 16. 0 (8. 1) hrs/d. On average residents spent 17. 4 (6. 0 - 23. 7) hrs/d undertaking sedentary activity. Sleeping duration was inversely related to body weight (r= - 0. 46, p< 0. 05) and TEE (r= - 0. 59, P< 0. 01). There was an inverse association between time lying down for both body weight (r= - 0. 45, p< 0. 05) and TEE (r= - 0. 62, p< 0. 01). TEE was positively correlated with number of steps per day (r= 0. 45, p< 0. 05). There was no relationship between TEE or BMI and the amount of physical activity. Variable patterns of physical activity and sleep duration demonstrates the need to recognise the influence of these factors on meeting energy requirements and the challenge of providing appropriate food and nutrition within the care home environment. Thus wearable technology has the potential to offer real-time feedback to support better nutritional management and improve efforts to prevent weight loss in dementia...|$|R
40|$|MR {{might be}} {{well suited to}} obtain {{reproducible}} and accurate measures of fat tissues in infants. This study evaluates MR-measurements of adipose tissue in young infants in vitro and in vivo. MR images of ten phantoms simulating subcutaneous fat of an infant's torso were obtained using a 1. 5 T MR scanner with and without simulated breathing. Scans consisted of a cartesian water-suppression turbo spin echo (wsTSE) sequence, and a PROPELLER wsTSE sequence. Fat volume was quantified directly and by MR imaging using k-means clustering and threshold-based segmentation procedures to calculate accuracy in vitro. Whole body MR was obtained in sleeping young infants (average age 67 ± 30 days). This study {{was approved by the}} local review board. All parents gave written informed consent. To obtain reproducibility in vivo, cartesian and PROPELLER wsTSE sequences were repeated in seven and four young infants, respectively. Overall, 21 repetitions were performed for the cartesian sequence and 13 repetitions for the PROPELLER sequence. In vitro accuracy errors depended on the chosen segmentation procedure, ranging from 5. 4 % to 76 %, while the sequence showed no significant influence. Artificial breathing increased the minimal accuracy error to 9. 1 %. In vivo reproducibility errors for total fat volume of the <b>sleeping</b> infants <b>ranged</b> from 2. 6 % to 3. 4 %. Neither segmentation nor sequence significantly influenced reproducibility. With both cartesian and PROPELLER sequences an accurate and reproducible measure of body fat was achieved. Adequate segmentation was mandatory for high accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Human {{dynamics}} model {{consistent with}} our natural ability to perform different activities is put forward by first arguing limitations of the model suggested by Barabási (Nature, 435, 207 - 211, 2005). Humans are capable of performing different types of activities which fill the time available between daily routine basic activities of cleaning themselves, eating and <b>sleeping.</b> The <b>range</b> of activities is substantial but for discussion I mention a few types of activities such as electronic communication, making telephone calls, meeting people and browsing internet etc [1]. In each type of activity, many events (tasks) are performed at different times, e. g. e-mail reply to a received e-mail is considered as an individual event and many such events belong to electronic communication activity. Recent observations indicate that the distributions, of waiting time (time taken to reply to a received message) and inter-event time between two consecutive emails during occurrences of many events, depart from the Poisson distribution and have burst characteristics [1]. This fact led Barabási [1] to suggest a model different than the available models based on Poisson processes and the model indeed captured the observed phenomenon in waiting time distribution. Here first I show weaknesses in Barabsi model and then put forward a generalized model for proper description of dynamics of human activities. In Barabási model, each individual has a priority list with L events (tasks) having different priorities governed by parameters xi(i = 1, 2,,L...|$|R

Most subjects {{of the two groups}} consider regular exercise {{to be the most important}} factor for maintaining health, and recognize hypertension as the number one concern. The most common nutritional supplement among subjects is multiple vitamins, and <b>sleeping</b> time <b>range</b> from 6 ~ 8 hours. Breakfast fasting rate was 15. 9 % among non-exercise group (NEG), where overeating and eating out rates were higher among exercise group (EG) when comparing to NEG. Fasting rates of breakfast, and consumption rates of milk and dairy products, vegetables such as kimchi, and fruits and fruit juices are higher among the EG. Overeating and eating out rates are lower among NEG, whereas eating rates of proteins like meat, fish, eggs, beans, fried foods, high-fat meats carbonated drinks, ice cream, and salt intakes are higher. Rates of health, dietary habits, and nutrient intakes are higher among EG. Energy intakes among the two groups were below the standard level, Vitamin B 2 intake is low in EG, and folic acid and calcium intakes were higher in NEG. The exercising group care more about health, eating habits and nutrient intakes, and low smoking rates are being observed. Thus, specific dietary improvement programs for adult men, are required, and it is necessary to consider the practice of nutrition education...|$|R
60|$|OF {{the village}} of Wish-ram, the aborigines' fishing mart of the Columbia, we have given some account in an early chapter of this work. The {{inhabitants}} held a traffic in the productions of the fisheries of the falls, and their village was the trading resort of the tribes from the coast and from the mountains. Mr. Hunt found the inhabitants shrewder and more intelligent than any Indians he had met with. Trade had sharpened their wits, though it had not improved their honesty; for they were a community of arrant rogues and freebooters. Their habitations comported with their circumstances, and were superior to any the travellers had yet seen west of the Rocky Mountains. In general, the dwellings of the savages on the Pacific side of that great barrier were mere tents and cabins of mats, or skins, or straw, the country being destitute of timber. In Wish-ram, on the contrary, the houses were built of wood, with long sloping roofs. The floor was sunk about six {{feet below the surface}} of the ground, with a low door at the gable end, extremely narrow, and partly sunk. Through this it was necessary to crawl and then to descend a short ladder. This inconvenient entrance was probably for the purpose of defense; there were loop-holes also under the eaves, apparently for the discharge of arrows. The houses were large, generally containing two or three families. Immediately within the door were <b>sleeping</b> places, <b>ranged</b> along the walls, like berths in a ship; and furnished with pallets of matting. These extended along one half of the building; the remaining half was appropriated to the storing of dried fish.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{tested the}} {{reproducibility}} {{of changes in}} the ambulatory blood pressure (BP) from the initial values, an indicator of BP reactivity and cardiovascular health outcomes, in young, healthy adults. METHOD: The subjects wore an ambulatory BP monitor attached by the same investigator at the same time of day until the next morning on two different days (day 1 and day 2) separated by a week. We compared the ambulatory BP change from the initial values at hourly intervals over 24 waking and sleeping hours on days 1 and 2 using linear regression and repeated measures analysis of covariance. RESULTS: The subjects comprised 88 men and 57 women (mean age ¡SE 22. 4 ¡ 0. 3 years) with normal BP (118. 3 ¡ 0. 9 / 69. 7 ¡ 0. 6 mmHg). For the total sample, the correlation between the ambulatory BP change on day 1 vs. day 2 over 24, waking, and <b>sleeping</b> hours <b>ranged</b> from 0. 37 – 0. 61; among women, the correlation was 0. 38 – 0. 71, and among men, it was 0. 24 – 0. 52. Among women, the ambulatory systolic/diastolic BP change was greater by 3. 1 ¡ 1. 0 / 2. 4 ¡ 0. 8 mmHg over 24 hours and by 3. 0 ¡ 1. 1 / 2. 4 ¡ 0. 8 mmHg over waking hours on day 1 than on day 2. The diastolic ambulatory BP change during sleeping hours was greater by 2. 2 ¡ 0. 9 mmHg on day 1 than on day 2, but the systolic ambulatory BP change during sleeping hours on days 1 and 2 did not differ. Among men, the ambulatory BP change on days 1 and 2 did not differ. CONCLUSION: Our primary findings were that the ambulatory BP change from the initial values was moderately reproducible; however, it was more reproducible in men than in women. These results suggest that women, but not men, may experience an alerting reaction to initially wearing the ambulatory BP monito...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that up to 80 % of people will experience symptoms of tinnitus over the courses of their lives, with rates of comorbid <b>sleeping</b> problems <b>ranging</b> from 50 to 77 %. Because of a potential connection between tinnitus and sleep disorders as well as high rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders, interdisciplinary approaches to treatment seem to be the most efficient option. In this study, we present the case of a 53 -year-old male patient, who started to experience symptoms of tinnitus at the age of 49, most likely caused by work-related stress. Over the course of his illness, the patient developed comorbid insomnia. He consulted us for treatment of both conditions and we developed a treatment plan with ten sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) followed by 10 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We used the Tinnitus Fragebogen (TF) to assess the severity of the tinnitus, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) for depressive symptoms, and the WHO Well-being Index (WHO- 5) for subjective well-being. Improvements could be achieved with regard to both diagnoses and the patient went from severe (48) to clinically negligible (12) TF scores, from minimal (BDI-II score 10) to no (0) depressive symptoms, and from just above critical (WHO- 5 percentile 52) to above average (84) well-being. The combination of technological and psychological approaches to treat tinnitus and insomnia thus proved successful in this case. One may therefore conclude that rTMS may be considered an effective first therapeutic step for tinnitus treatment prior to CBT. To our knowledge this is the first published case in which rTMS and CBT were combined for tinnitus therapy. The approach proved successful since it led to a considerable increase in well-being and everyday functioning. To gauge the effect on a more general level, large-scale studies are still needed to cancel out potential placebo effects. Likewise, the importance of the order of the two treatments, and the possibility of using other therapies in combination with CBT to address certain tinnitus subtypes and different etiologies must be studied in greater detail...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundInsecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are {{becoming}} increasingly available to vulnerable populations at risk for malaria. Their appropriate and consistent use is essential to preventing malaria, but ITN use often lags behind ITN ownership. In order to increase ITN use, {{it is necessary to}} devise strategies that accurately identify, differentiate, and target the reasons and types of non-use. MethodsA simple method based on the end-user as the denominator was employed to classify each individual into one of four ITN use categories: 1) living in households not owning an ITN; 2) living in households owning, but not hanging an ITN; 3) living in households owning and hanging an ITN, but who are not sleeping under one; and 4) sleeping under an ITN. This framework was applied to survey data designed to evaluate long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) distributions following integrated campaigns in five countries: Togo, Sierra Leone, Madagascar, Kenya and Niger. ResultsThe percentage of children < 5 years of age sleeping under an ITN ranged from 51. 5 % in Kenya to 81. 1 % in Madagascar. Among the three categories of non-use, children living in households without an ITN make up largest group (range: 9. 4 %- 30. 0 %), despite the efforts of the integrated child health campaigns. The percentage of children who live in households that own but do not hang an ITN ranged from 5. 1 % to 16. 1 %. The percentage of children living in households where an ITN was suspended, but who were not <b>sleeping</b> under it <b>ranged</b> from 4. 3 % to 16. 4 %. Use by all household members in Sierra Leone (39. 9 %) and Madagascar (60. 4 %) indicate that integrated campaigns reach beyond their desired target populations. ConclusionsThe framework outlined in this paper provides a helpful tool to examine the deficiencies in ITN use. Monitoring and evaluation strategies designed to assess ITN ownership and use can easily incorporate this approach using existing data collection instruments that measure the standard indicators...|$|R

All rights reserved. Purpose The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate adolescents' (11 ??? 15 years) experience of their general practitioner (GP), whether poor reported GP experience was associated with worse physical and mental health measures and whether poor previous GP experience was linked to lower utilization of these services. Methods We used logistic regression to analyze data from the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study. Four aspects of recent care experience were studied: feeling at ease, feeling treated with respect, satisfaction with doctor's explanation, and feeling able to discuss personal matters. Five dichotomized measures of health status were used: ever self-harmed; fair or poor self-reported health; frequent (at least weekly) low mood; sleeping problems; or headaches. Results Of 5, 335 students, 4, 149 reported having visiting their GP within the past year. Of these, 91. 8 % felt treated with respect, 78. 7 % felt at ease, 85. 7 % were satisfied with explanation, and 53. 9 % felt able to discuss personal matters. After adjusting for ethnicity, age, gender, and family affluence score, poor experience on any indicator was strongly associated with increased risk of self-harm (adjusted odds ratio range, 2. 01 ??? 2. 70; all p <. 001); feeling low (AOR range, 1. 53 ??? 2. 11; all p <. 001); and <b>sleeping</b> problems (AOR <b>range,</b> 1. 49 ??? 1. 91; all p ???. 001). Poor experience on all indicators, except discussing personal matters, was associated with worse self-reported health. Conclusions Nearly half of this large, national study of adolescents did not feel able to discuss personal matters with their doctor. There was a consistent, strong association between reported lack of good GP experience and poor health measures...|$|R
