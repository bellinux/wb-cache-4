5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal <b>scientific</b> standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely <b>scientific.</b> It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the <b>scientific</b> method and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with {{the very nature of}} evolutionary theory, the <b>scientific</b> method, and philosophy of science.|$|E

5|$|All {{editions of}} the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first {{publication}} of {{it was done in}} the United States by I. Bernard Cohen. The book is Franklin's only <b>scientific</b> work, and is recognized by historians Gary F. Kurutz and Dennis Smith as America's most important <b>scientific</b> book of the eighteenth century. The publication for his <b>scientific</b> observations on electricity made Franklin famous throughout Europe as a serious scientist. Eighteenth-century British polymath Joseph Priestley writes in his book The History and Present State of Electricity (1767) that nobody had written an in-depth study of electricity with the use of <b>scientific</b> experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in the eighteenth century.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1970s, as the {{viability}} of Edmund's business model waned, Norman Edmund's son Robert Edmund refashioned the business into two new ones, Edmund <b>Scientifics</b> and Edmund Optics. Edmund <b>Scientifics</b> marketed to consumers and specialized in science-themed toys, vaguely high-tech household gadgets, and [...] "science gifts." [...] Edmund Optics {{did not have a}} public showroom like Edmund <b>Scientifics,</b> although the two organizations shared the same building. The large back room of Edmund <b>Scientifics</b> still sold military surplus from World War II and other wars well into the 1980s and into the mid-1990s. Some of the items in the surplus room were from German and other non-American militaries. None of these items were in the mail-order catalogs. They also sold other surplus wares of interest to hobbyists, including specialized motors and other miscellaneous electronics, parts from toys, and other household items.|$|R

5|$|From 1950 to 1952, {{there were}} a series of {{disputes}} between EES director Rosselot and Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson over the station's finances and Rosselot's hand in founding <b>Scientific</b> Associates. When {{it was founded in}} October 1951, Rosselot was president and CEO of <b>Scientific</b> Associates; at issue was the potential conflict of interest with his role at Georgia Tech, and what, if any, role Georgia Tech should have in technology transfer to the marketplace. Emerson later instituted a policy requiring EES employees wishing to work with <b>Scientific</b> Associates to make a written request to the president of Georgia Tech. However, Rosselot's participation in <b>Scientific</b> Associates' founding and early operations ensured the eventual success of <b>Scientific</b> Atlanta and facilitated subsequent technology transfer by Georgia Tech's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center.|$|E

5|$|Granat was a three-axis-stabilized {{spacecraft}} and {{the last}} of the 4MV Bus produced by the Lavochkin <b>Scientific</b> Production Association. It was similar to the Astron observatory which was functional from 1983 to 1989; for this reason, the spacecraft was originally known as the Astron 2. It weighed 4.4 metric tons and carried almost 2.3 metric tons of international <b>scientific</b> instrumentation. Granat stood 6.5m tall and had a total span of 8.5 m across its solar arrays. The power made available to the <b>scientific</b> instruments was approximately 400W.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the {{cultivated}} plant taxonomist is concerned with the naming of plants as prescribed by two plant nomenclatural Codes. The provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Botanical Code) serve primarily <b>scientific</b> ends and the objectives of the <b>scientific</b> community, while those of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (Cultivated Plant Code) are designed to serve both <b>scientific</b> and utilitarian ends by making provision for the names of plants used in commerce — the cultigens that have arisen in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. These names, sometimes called variety names, are not in Latin but are added onto the <b>scientific</b> Latin names, and they assist communication among the community of foresters, farmers and horticulturists.|$|E

Although the majority of his publications focused on defending phlogiston theory, he also did some original work on spontaneous generation and dreams. Despite Priestley's reduced <b>scientific</b> output, his presence stimulated American interest in chemistry.|$|E

5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and intelligent design, {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a god or intelligence is at least as <b>scientific</b> as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and <b>scientific</b> acceptance. The <b>scientific</b> community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the <b>scientific</b> method, evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E
