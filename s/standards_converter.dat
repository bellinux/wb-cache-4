50|$|Television {{standards}} conversion is {{the process}} of changing one type of TV system to another. The most common is from NTSC to PAL or the other way around.

After a short description of the general multidimensional sampling rate conversion, the degradations inherent in conventional converters are explained. The most disturbing artefacts are motion judder, motion blurring and vertical detail flashing. To improve the conversion, a motion-compensating interpolation filter {{is used in the}} new converter. To adapt the filter a motion vector estimation and a segmentation are performed. Global and local motion vectors are estimated using a block matching method. Incorrectly estimated vectors are eliminated by nonlinear postprocessing. The segmentation distinguishes between unchanged and changed parts of the image. Furthermore a suitable motion vector is defined for each pixel in the intermediate output field by selecting one of the surrounding block vectors or the global vector. Postprocessing of the pixel vectors is performed to eliminate incorrectly selected pixel vectors.

5000|$|A Frame Synchronizer {{is used in}} television/video {{production}} to synchronize the timing of a video source signal to coincide with a central timing reference (usually a color black signal aka [...] "black burst" [...] that is distributed throughout a facility). The synchronizer accomplishes this by (first digitizing in an analog scenario and) writing the incoming digital video into a frame buffer memory using {{the timing of the}} sync information contained in that video signal. Simultaneously the digital video is being read back out of the buffer by an independent timing system that is [...] "genlocked" [...] to the house timing reference. As a result, the timing or alignment of the video frame can be adjusted so that the start of the upper left corner scan line of the image occurs simultaneously on all video equipment in the work flow. This is an absolute requirement for both analog and digital systems in order to perform video effects or glitch-free source switching. Note that frame synchronization can only be performed within a given television line standard. A synchronizer will not convert an NTSC signal to a PAL signal or vice versa; it takes a Video <b>Standards</b> <b>Converter</b> to do that.|$|E
