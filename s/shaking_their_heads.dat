5|$|Visual {{displays}} mostly {{occur in}} agonistic situations. Elephants {{will try to}} appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by <b>shaking</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.|$|E
25|$|I {{certainly}} don't {{feel like}} a winner. That's how I'd feel {{if there were a}} few shocked Brusselian bureaucrats walking around the piece, <b>shaking</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> thinking about what those Czechs have done here. We expected this to be treated as a joke, a happening, a nice installation, nothing else. That we are already discussing the removal of some parts doesn't seem like a tremendous success to me. I'd be much happier if it remained whole.|$|E
25|$|As MacKenzie's layout {{was seen}} by more and more people, a {{collective}} shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed—"looking like rabbits in the headlights"—as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it—they just took one look and went away <b>shaking</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'.|$|E

60|$|The men {{who were}} left behind <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> doubtfully, stroked <b>their</b> chins, and <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> again. The farrier said that {{certainly}} Will Marks was a good horseman, nobody should ever say he denied that: but he was rash, very rash, {{and there was no}} telling what the end of it might be; what did he go for, that was what he wanted to know? He wished the young fellow no harm, but why did he go? Everybody echoed these words, and <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> again, having done which they wished John Podgers good night, and straggled home to bed.|$|R

500|$|Feeling {{as though}} he were [...] "constantly trying to prove myself", Beck {{suffered}} a backlash, with skeptics denouncing him as a self-indulgent fake and the latest marketing opportunity. In the summer of 1994, Beck was struggling and many of his fellow musicians thought he had lost his way. Combined with the song's wildly popular music video and the world tour, Beck reacted believing the attention could not last, resulting in a status as a [...] "one-hit wonder". At other concerts, crowds were treated to twenty minutes of reggae or Miles Davis or jazz-punk iterations of [...] "Loser". At one-day festivals in California, he surrounded himself with an artnoise combo. The drummer set fire to his cymbals; the lead guitarist [...] "played" [...] his char with the strings faced towards his body; and Beck changed the words to [...] "Loser" [...] so that nobody could sing along. [...] "I can't tell you how many times I was looking at faces that were looking back at me with complete bewilderment—or just pointing and <b>shaking</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> and laughing—while performing during that period," [...] he later recalled. Despite this, Beck gained the respect of his peers, such as Tom Petty and Johnny Cash, and created an entire wave of bands determined to recapture the Mellow Gold sound. Feeling his previous releases were just collections of demos recorded {{over the course of several}} years, Beck desired to enter the studio and record an album in a continuous linear fashion, which became Odelay.|$|E

2500|$|In 1988–89, Australia lost {{again to}} the West Indies, and Border's form suffered; the West Indies {{routinely}} applied a tactic of targeting the opposition captain when he batted, thus undermining his confidence {{and that of the}} team. It worked to the extent that Border compiled 258 runs at 32.25 and his best performance was with the ball. He celebrated becoming the first Australian to play 100 Tests by taking 7/46 and 4/50, backed with an innings of 75, in Australia's only victory for the series, in the Fourth Test at Sydney. His bowling figures are the best for a match (and second best for an innings) by an Australian captain. Previously, he had taken 16 wickets in 99 Tests. Receiving the player of the match award, Border said, [...] "there will be batsmen all around the world <b>shaking</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> in disbelief when they see the result".|$|E

2500|$|On April 4, 1988, in the 50th NCAA Tournament National Championship game, Kansas {{defeated}} the heavily favored Oklahoma Sooners 83–79 to win its second NCAA Men's Basketball championship. Led by senior forward and Player of the Year Danny Manning, Kevin Pritchard, Milt Newton, Chris Piper and {{a roster of}} players who {{came to be known}} as [...] "The Miracles" [...] raced the Sooners to a 50–50 halftime tie that had the referees <b>shaking</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> and smiling as they left the court. [...] Upon their return for the second half, Larry Brown convinced his Jayhawks that now that they proved they could run with the Sooners, they needed to slow the game down and take the Sooners out of their fast break offense. [...] The Sooners built a 5-point second half lead until the Kansas defense finally clamped down. [...] The Jayhawks, led by Manning (31 points, 18 rebounds, 5 steals, 2 blocked shots), caught up with them around the 11 minute mark. [...] The rest of the game was neck and neck, until Manning finally sealed the victory from the free throw line.|$|E
