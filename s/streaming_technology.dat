25|$|Internet {{television}} (Internet TV), (online television) or IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) is {{the digital}} distribution of television content via the Internet {{as opposed to}} traditional systems like terrestrial, cable and satellite, although internet itself is received by terrestrial, cable or satellite methods. Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows and other video content over the Internet by video <b>streaming</b> <b>technology,</b> typically by major traditional television broadcasters.|$|E
25|$|On November 30, 2016, Netflix {{launched}} an offline playback feature, allowing {{users of the}} Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time. Netflix {{is going to start}} partnering with airlines to provide them with its mobile <b>streaming</b> <b>technology.</b> This will start next year {{as part of an effort}} to get airlines to provide better in-flight Wi-Fi.|$|E
25|$|Voddler's <b>streaming</b> <b>technology,</b> called Vnet by the company, is a peer-to-peer-based video content {{delivery}} solution. With p2p-streaming, movies are not streamed from a central server or {{content delivery}} network (CDN), but from other users who have parts of the movie on their units after seeing the movie earlier. This process begins when a user clicks play for a movie and continues throughout the viewing time, allowing for seamless viewing. After the viewer has completed watching the video, parts of the video file remains for a time on the user's device. Popular content, that is watched by many other users, remain longer on any one user's device than less popular content, which more quickly {{is removed from the}} network nodes.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{the music}} {{services}} Muzak / DMX Music or Music Choice, the SiriusXM for Business service {{uses the same}} channels and SDARS delivery platform as the consumer Sirius service. The SDARS delivery platform, on the other hand, is more reliable {{than any of the}} other services in that it is not subject to satellite dish rain fade. The highly elliptical orbit of the Sirius satellite constellation can pose difficulties for the reliable delivery of the signal to stationary antennas in certain parts of the country. To eliminate this potential problem, Sirius launched a new geostationary satellite, FM-5, to improve service to non-mobile customers such as those of SiriusXM for Business. The service can also be accessed online using Sirius' online <b>streaming</b> <b>technology,</b> allowing any business with a broadband Internet connection to overcome any potential reception issues. Additionally, Sirius is applying for repeaters in Hawaii and Alaska and has already been granted authority for 20 repeaters covering the island of Puerto Rico by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).|$|E
2500|$|Voddler is a Stockholm, Sweden-based {{provider}} of a video-on-demand (VOD) platform and a <b>streaming</b> <b>technology</b> for over-the-top (OTT) streaming {{on the public}} Internet. In Scandinavia, Voddler is primarily known for the commercial VOD-service Voddler, which was launched in 2009. As a company, Voddler was founded in 2005 and developed its own streaming solution, called Vnet. Vnet is based on peer-to-peer (p2p), where all users contribute by streaming movies to each other, but, unlike traditional p2p, Vnet has a central administrator who decides which users that have access to which movies. Due to this exception, Vnet {{has been referred to}} as a [...] "hybrid p2p distribution system", [...] "walled garden p2p" [...] or [...] "controlled p2p". In addition to running the consumer service Voddler, the company Voddler also offers, since 2013, Vnet as a stand-alone technology for other streaming platforms. The service Bollyvod, a global VOD-service for Bollywood-content that Voddler built for the Indian movie industry, was released as a pilot in 2014.|$|E

40|$|Parallel bit <b>stream</b> <b>technology</b> {{is a novel}} {{approach}} to interpret byte stream data and exploit data level parallelism by employing single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) instructions. Parabix, an XML parser embedded with parallel bit <b>stream</b> <b>technology,</b> performs much better than traditional XML parsers that process XML documents in byte-at-a-time fashion. The project attempts to enhance the performance of Expat, an traditional XML parser, by embedding parallel bit <b>stream</b> <b>technology</b> into Expat. Most byte-at-a-time loops are identified and then replaced with bit stream operations. A performance case study is conducted by comparing the performance result between the original Expat and the parallel bit stream version.

50|$|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was {{released}} using the IW 4.0 engine, {{the only game}} to do so. The IW 4.0 engine featured texture <b>streaming</b> <b>technology</b> to create much higher environmental detail without sacrificing performance. Call of Duty: Black Ops was not based on IW 4.0; rather, Treyarch further enhanced the version of IW 3.0 they had used in their previous game. This version of the engine also featured <b>streaming</b> <b>technology,</b> lighting enhancements, and support for 3D imaging. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 utilizes an improved version of the IW 4.0 engine. Improvements on the engine allow better <b>streaming</b> <b>technology</b> which allows larger regions for the game while running at a minimum of 60 frames per second. Further improvements to the audio and lighting engines {{have been made in}} this version.|$|E
