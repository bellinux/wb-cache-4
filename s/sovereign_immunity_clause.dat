40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the applicability of <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> to the so-called sovereign wealth funds (“SWFs”) within the U. S. legal system. While <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> has existed for at least two centuries, SWFs and the types of investment activities they conduct on behalf of their parent foreign states are a rather recent phenomenon. As a result, the issue of the applicability of the rules on <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> to the SWFs poses novel legal challenges and difficulties. In a nutshell, this article is intended to answer the following questions: Are SWFs entitled to invoke <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> before U. S. courts? If so, what is the U. S. law regime of <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> applicable to the case of the SWFs...|$|R

Chinese state-owned companies considered instrumental to the state have claimed <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> in lawsuits brought against them in foreign courts before. China’s view is that <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> is a lawful right and interest that their enterprises are entitled to protect.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the legal parameters of <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> and its waivers for employees of public {{institutions of higher}} education in the state of Texas. This empirical study examined the decisions of the Texas Judiciary concerning public university litigation in the area of <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity,</b> with a review of major state court decisions.

40|$|Very {{early in}} our history we took steps to insure that the. rule of law, as {{expressed}} in the Constitution, would prevail over the mortals who run our government.

40|$|What are the {{constitutional}} parameters of state <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity?</b> The Court {{has made clear}} that certain provisions of Article I contain no authority for overriding state <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity,</b> while {{at least one other}} provision, the Fourteenth Amendment, permits Congress to abrogate the states’ <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity.</b> How is this constitutional line drawn? It is temporally bound? In other words, are only certain Amendments enacted after the Eleventh Amendment free from absolute subservience to state <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity?</b> Or, does it divide the original Constitution and its Amendments, meaning that state <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> permeates the original Constitution but does not infiltrate certain Amendments, even those ratified before the Eleventh? Is state <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> article-bound, which would prohibit Congress from subjecting the states to private suit under any Article I power, but leave open the possibility that Article II or Article IV might overcome immunity? Or perhaps it is clause-bound, which would really provide no rule at all, and require a clause-by-clause analysis of Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s plan of the convention? I explore these questions and argue that the state <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> envisioned by the Court is an Amendment-driven inquiry: it is inviolable to the extent of the original Constitution, and even such nationalistic powers as Congress 2 ̆ 7 Article I War Powers or the Treaty Power of Article II cater to it.

40|$|As I suggest {{below in}} Part I, federal <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> was a {{doctrine}} of limited effect {{in the early years}} of this republic and allowed for a number of remedies for governmental wrongdoing. Moreover, the constitutional provenance of federal 2 ̆ 2 <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> 2 ̆ 2 is obscure, and was a matter of genuine uncertainty in early years. Over time the doctrine developed, drawing support from some aspects of constitutional architecture as well as from unreasoning and mistaken extensions of other versions of 2 ̆ 2 <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity.</b> 2 ̆ 2 Among the strands of constitutional structure behind federal 2 ̆ 2 <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> 2 ̆ 2 are Congress 2 ̆ 7 powers over appropriations and the jurisdiction of the federal courts, powers that do not necessarily require but may help explain the early attraction of <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> as a doctrine. As described in Part II, the 2 ̆ 2 <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> 2 ̆ 2 doctrine has been dynamic, not static, as judges make choices about how broadly or narrowly to characterize its reach in response to legislation by Congress. In the inter-branch dynamic, both Congress and the Court have refrained at critical junctures from pressing constitutional limits, a restraint that has created an arguably beneficial ambiguity about the relationship of the judicial power to the legislative power in resolving claims against the government. Yet given the adverse effects of <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> on courts 2 ̆ 7 capacities to provide individual justice, it is past time for that dynamic to move back towards more restrictive understandings of the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s scope. In Part III, I consider federal <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> 2 ̆ 7 s relation to aspects of the idea of judicial independence embodied in Article III of the United States Constitution. Doctrines that article III courts will not enter ineffective or advisory judgments, nor judgments subject to legislative or executive revision or direction, coalesce in cases involving claims against the government, in ways that suggest that <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> may have been thought to preserve an aura of judicial independence. In light of the competing constitutional norms at stake and the well-established independence of the federal courts today, I end by urging re-interpretation of federal <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> doctrines so as to close rather than widen remedial gaps in the law...|$|R
40|$|Discussions of <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> {{assume that}} the Constitution {{contains}} no explicit text regarding <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity.</b> As a result, arguments about the existence - or nonexistence - of <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> begin with the English and American common-law doctrines. Exploring political, fiscal, and legal developments in England and the American colonies in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries, this Article shows that focusing on common-law developments is misguided. The common-law approach to <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> ended in the early 1700 s. The Bankers 2 ̆ 7 Case (1690 - 1700), which is often regarded as the first modern common-law treatment of <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity,</b> is in fact the last in the line of English common-law decisions on <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity.</b> After (and in part because of) the Bankers 2 ̆ 7 Case, settling claims against the Crown became a function of Parliament, swept up within its newly won powers over finance and appropriations. After examining comparable developments in the American colonies and during the Confederation period and the formation of the Constitution, the Article demonstrates that the Appropriations Clause embedded in the Constitution the principle of congressional supremacy - and a resulting lack of judicial power-over monetary claims against the United States, a point recognized by early cases and commentators. As such, the Appropriations Clause provides a textual basis for the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s immunity from suits on claims seeking money damages...|$|R

25|$|In the 1833 case of Barron v.

After the Civil War, Congress and the states ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, which included the Due Process Clause and the Privileges or <b>Immunities</b> <b>Clause.</b> While the Fifth Amendment had included a due process clause, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment crucially differed from the Fifth Amendment in that it explicitly applied to the states. The Privileges or <b>Immunities</b> <b>Clause</b> also explicitly applied to the states, unlike the Privileges and <b>Immunities</b> <b>Clause</b> of Article IV of the Constitution. In the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), the Supreme Court ruled that the Privileges or <b>Immunities</b> <b>Clause</b> was not designed to protected individuals from the actions of state governments. In Twining v.

40|$|One of {{the most}} vital and {{contentious}} proceedings between a casino debtor and a regulatory agency is a post-petition license revocation hearing. Much debate exists about whether the license qualifies as property of the estate and whether the regulatory agency can be exempted from the protections inherent in the Bankruptcy Code due {{to the use of}} police and regulatory power. However, maybe the most contentious and impactful debate is whether the regulatory agency is free from the bankruptcy court’s jurisdiction due to the Eleventh Amendment’s guarantee of <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity.</b> At the center of the tension concerning <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> lies 11 U. S. C. § 106 (a), which authorizes the bankruptcy court to abrogate state <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity.</b> In the past fifteen years, the United States Supreme Court issued three key decisions concerning the federal government’s ability to abrogate statutorily states’ <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> pursuant to its Article I power and the bankruptcy court’s unique position in the long standing controversy. The states’ ability to assert their <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> in bankruptcy proceedings is particularly relevant to casino bankruptcies due to the heavy involvement of the state gaming regulator. With the Bankruptcy Code in question, state governmental units and the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court are in direct conflict. This Note outlines the historical context, relevant Supreme Court decisions, and the cloudy, ill-defined area in which bankruptcy courts are authorized to abrogate states’ <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity.</b> Additionally, this Note explores the analysis courts use when determining whether a regulatory agency’s power to revoke licenses is exempted from the automatic stay. Lastly, this Note argues that the three recent Supreme Court cases restored order to the bankruptcy court’s ability to pierce the <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> of a regulatory agency during a license revocation hearing of a casino debtor...|$|R
