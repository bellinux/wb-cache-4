2500|$|Many popular surfing {{destinations}} have surf {{schools and}} surf camps that offer lessons. Surf camps for beginners and intermediates are multi-day lessons {{that focus on}} surfing fundamentals. They are designed to take new surfers and help them become proficient riders. All-inclusive surf camps offer overnight accommodations, meals, lessons and surfboards. Most surf lessons begin with instruction and a safety briefing on land, followed by instructors helping students into waves on longboards or [...] "softboards". The <b>softboard</b> is considered the ideal surfboard for learning, {{due to the fact}} it is safer, and has more paddling speed and stability than shorter boards. Funboards are also a popular shape for beginners as they combine the volume and stability of the longboard with the manageable size of a smaller surfboard.|$|E
5000|$|Püssi has {{historically}} {{served as a}} production center for particle board. At {{the time of the}} collapse of the Soviet Union, the town's largest employer was particle board manufacturer Repo Vabrikud, which employed 1,400 people, over half the city. Although Repo Vabrikud has scaled back employment significantly, other particle board manufacturers have moved in. Sorbes Group has the production center for its [...] "Repo by Sorbes" [...] line of particle board in Püssi. In 2011, the Estonian furniture manufacturer Viisnurk took over an inactive <b>softboard</b> factory in the city with the intention to manufacture <b>softboard</b> for international clients in Asia and Europe.|$|E
50|$|Lower grade timber is {{converted}} to pulp to make newsprint. Higher grade timber is used in house construction. Radiata is used chipped to make particle board sheets, commonly used in flooring. Other sheet products are hardboard, <b>softboard</b> and ply. Most ply is structural and available in 7-22 mm sizes. A small amount of higher grade ply is used to produce thinner (4 and 7 mm) ply suitable for furniture, cabinet work and boat building. This is knot and crack free and glued with resorcinol waterproof glue. Since the 1990s finger jointed joinery-grade wood has become available in up to 6 m lengths {{in a wide range}} of profiles.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSeveral indoor {{insulation}} systems {{based on}} ecological materials as cellulose, perlite, wooden <b>softboard</b> and reed board with loam, were tested for their susceptibility against fungi under natural- and laboratory conditions. Fungal growth was evaluated by cultivation- and molecular methods. The materials showed a different bio-susceptibility: whereas insulations {{made of wood}} and reed with loam had high cell counts, perlite did not show any fungal growth. Therefore, from the microbiological point of view, plaster and board made of perlite are most suitable for thermal insulation. Furthermore, for future applications we suggest a DNA-extraction protocol for microbial ecology studies of construction materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} Broadband, Low-Noise and Power Microwave Amplifiers using {{microstrip}} <b>softboard</b> technology is investigated. The software program TOUCHSTONE (TM) by EEsof is used extensively {{as a basic}} design tool. The characterisation of the GaAs Field Effect Transistors, used for the amplifiers, is carried out. These characterisations are then used by the program in its circuit analysis. A determination {{of the validity of}} using the manufacturer's data, for the designs, is determined by comparing it to the measured data. Source-Pull and Load-Pull measurements were performed for the Power GaAs FET characterisation. The noise-parameter device characterisation is carried out in a similar way to that for Load-Pull data. Each amplifier required final tuning adjustments in order to peak the performances. The Broadband Maximum Gain Amplifier had a 10 ± 1. 5 dB gain over a bandwidth from 2 - to 6 -GHz. The Low-Noise amplifier achieved 5 dB Noise-Figure and 5. 4 ± 1. 4 dB gain over the 2 - to 6 -GHz band. The Power amplifier Output Power was 390 mW over the 3. 7 - to 4. 2 -GHz band. Techniques of broadband matching are investigated, with Double-Stub matching producing the widest bandwidth. A literature survey is presented on aspects of broadband microwave amplifiers, as well as a survey on Computer-aided-design at microwave frequencies and techniques of Large-Signal Transistor characterisation...|$|E
40|$|Compared with {{conventional}} systems made of expanded polystyrene {{the characteristics of}} systems with wooden <b>softboards</b> diverge substantially. These special characteristics {{must be taken into}} account. Apart from the characteristics of the building physical aspect, which are specified before, ecological characteristics come to the fore. There are aspects such as environmental sustainability of the raw materials, CO 2 - storage and "naturalness" of the building materials. In addition, this naturalness has its characteristics: From influences of the weather the wooden <b>softboards</b> are only protected by a few millimeter thick plaster. The system itself has to protect the entire basic wall construction over at least 30 to 50 years with appropriate maintenance costs against influences of the weather. If this protection is no longer ensured, the natural purge occurs relatively fast. At the WKI institute weathering models for an artificial weathering were as well as a computer progr am for a numeric simulation developed to predict the long-term behaviour. Different companies use these important tools for quality control system and for testing new systems before bringing a new system on the market...|$|R
40|$|The BAT {{reference}} document (BREF) entitled ‘Production of Wood-based Panels' forms {{part of a}} series presenting the results of an exchange of information between EU Member States, the industries concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection, and the Commission, to draw up, review and, where necessary, update BAT {{reference document}}s as required by Article 13 (1) of the Directive 2010 / 75 /EU on industrial emissions. This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for the production of wood-based panels covers the activities specified in Section 6. 1 (c) of Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU. In particular, this document addresses the following processes and activities: • the manufacture of wood-based panels by dry or wet processes; including the production of: • particleboard (PB); • oriented strand board (OSB); • medium density fibreboard (MDF), including low density fibreboard (LDF) and high density fibreboard (HDF), produced in a dry process; • fibreboard, including rigidboard (RB) and flexboard (FB), produced in a dry process; • fibreboard, including <b>softboard</b> (SB) and hardboard (HB), produced in a wet process. This document covers all activities from the storage of raw materials to the finished raw board ready for storage. This document additionally addresses the following activities which are considered activities directly associated to the main Annex I, Section 6. 1 (c) activity, even if the directly associated activity is not necessarily an Annex I activity itself: • on-site combustion plants (including engines) generating hot gases for directly heated dryers without restriction of capacity; • the manufacture of impregnated paper with resins. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the wood-based panels industry are the emissions to air from dryers and presses of dust, formaldehyde, and volatile organic compounds. This BREF contains seven chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 provide general information on the wood-based panels industry and on the common industrial processes and techniques used within the whole sector. Chapters 3 and 4 provide information and data concerning the applied processes and techniques in the sector; the environmental performance of installations in terms of current emissions, consumption of raw materials, water and energy, as well as on generation of waste; the techniques to prevent and/or reduce emissions from the wood-based panels production plants. In Chapter 5, the BAT conclusions, as defined in Article 3 (12) of the Directive, are presented for the wood-based panels industry. In Chapter 6, the emerging techniques are presented. Chapter 7 is dedicated to concluding remarks and recommendations for future work regarding the sector. JRC. J. 5 -Sustainable Production and Consumptio...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation was}} undertaken {{of the techniques}} (materials and technologies) used to construct the shell of the New Zealand house (envelope and interior linings) between 1792 and 1982. Using census, manufacturing and import statistics with analysis of local and international archives and publications, principal techniques were selected and documented. A review of local construction and building publications provide a background {{to the development of}} construction education and training, as well as the speed of change. Analysis of census data showed that from 1858 to 1981 the majority of dwelling walls in terms of construction (appearance) were timber, brick, board or concrete, while the structure was timber frame. Analysis of import data for seven materials (galvanised iron, asbestos cement, cement, window glass, wood nails, gypsum and roofing slate) from 1870 to 1965 found the UK was a majority supplier until 1925, except for USA gypsum. For the rest of the period, the UK continued to play a preeminent role with increasing Australian imports and local manufacture. Examination of archival and published information on techniques used for the sub-floor, floor, wall (construction and structure), fenestration, roof and thermal insulation provide an overview of country of orign, decade of arrival, spread of use and, if relevant, reasons for failure. Forty materials (including earth and brick, stone, cement and concrete, timber and ferrous metals) and twenty-four technologies are documented. Revised dates of first NZ use are provided for eight of these e. g. the shift from balloon to platform framing occurred in the early 1880 s rather than 1890 s. Three case studies examine different aspects of the techniques (nails 1860 to 1965, hollow concrete blocks 1904 to 1910 and camerated concrete 1908 to 1920). The research shows that timber was the predominant structural (framing) material from 1792 to 1982. From the 1930 s there was a shift away from timber construction (external appearance) to a wider range of products, including brick, board (asbestos- and more recently fibre-cement) and concrete. A new chronological classification of house development is proposed. These techniques travelled {{in a variety of ways}} and at speeds which indicate over this time New Zealand was technologically well connected and supported an innovative construction sector. The techniques covered are: Boards: asbestos, and cellulose fibre-cement, particle, plywood, pumice, <b>softboard,</b> and hardboard; Bricks: double and veneer; Building paper; Cement and lime: local and imported; Concrete: hollow block, monolithic, reinforced, Camerated, Oratonu and Pearse patents; Fired earth: bricks and terracotta roof tiles; Floors: concrete slab, suspended, and terrazzo; Framing: balloon, braced, light steel, and platform; Insulation: cork, fibreglass, macerated paper, perlite, pumice, foil, and mineral wool; Iron and Steel: cast and wrought iron, steel; Linings: fibrous plaster, plasterboard and wet; metal tile, shingles and slates; Nails: cut, hand-made, wire and plates; Piles: concrete, native timber and stone; Roof: strutted and truss rafter; Roofing: aluminium, corrugated iron,; Sub-floor: vapour barrier, walls and ventilation; Timber: air and kiln drying, glulam, native, pit-saw and preservative treatments; Wall constructions: earth, log, slab, solid timber, raupo and stone; Weatherboards; and Windows: glass, aluminium, steel and timber frames...|$|E
