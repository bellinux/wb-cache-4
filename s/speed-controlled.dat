50|$|A Ward Leonard {{control is}} usually used for {{controlling}} a shunt or compound wound DC motor, and {{developed as a}} method of providing a <b>speed-controlled</b> motor from an AC supply, though it is not without its advantages in DC schemes. The AC supply is used to drive an AC motor, usually an induction motor that drives a DC generator or dynamo. The DC output from the armature is directly connected to the armature of the DC motor (sometimes but not always of identical construction). The shunt field windings of both DC machines are independently excited through variable resistors. Extremely good speed control from standstill to full speed, and consistent torque, can be obtained by varying the generator and/or motor field current. This method of control was the de facto method from its development until it was superseded by solid state thyristor systems. It found service in almost any environment where good speed control was required, from passenger lifts through to large mine pit head winding gear and even industrial process machinery and electric cranes. Its principal disadvantage was that three machines were required to implement a scheme (five in very large installations, as the DC machines were often duplicated and controlled by a tandem variable resistor). In many applications, the motor-generator set was often left permanently running, to avoid the delays that would otherwise be caused by starting it up as required. Although electronic (thyristor) controllers have replaced most small to medium Ward-Leonard systems, some very large ones (thousands of horsepower) remain in service. The field currents are much lower than the armature currents, allowing a moderate sized thyristor unit to control a much larger motor than it could control directly. For example, in one installation, a 300 amp thyristor unit controls the field of the generator. The generator output current is in excess of 15,000 amperes, which would be prohibitively expensive (and inefficient) to control directly with thyristors.|$|E

Working out of {{mathematical}} {{models of the}} <b>speed-controlled</b> induction electric drives ensuring joint consideration of transformers, motors and loadings, and also matching reducers and transformers, both in static, and in dynamic regimes {{for the analysis of}} their operating characteristics. Methodology. At mathematical modelling are considered functional, mass, dimensional and cost indexes of reducers and transformers that allows observing engineering and economic aspects of <b>speed-controlled</b> induction electric drives. The mathematical models used for examination of the transitive electromagnetic and electromechanical processes, are grounded on systems of nonlinear differential equations with nonlinear coefficients (parameters of equivalent circuits of motors), varying in each operating point, including owing to appearances of saturation of magnetic system and current displacement in a winding of a rotor of an induction motor.

Modelling of the several <b>speed-controlled</b> induction electric drives, different by components, but working on a loading equal on character, magnitude and a demanded control range is executed. At use of characteristic families including mechanical, at various parameters of regulating on which performances of the load mechanism are superimposed, the adjusting characteristics representing dependences of a modification of electrical, energy and thermal magnitudes from an angular speed of motors are gained.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of utilization of low-grade solid fuels of either renewable or fossil origin such as biomass, municipal or agricultural wastes, peat, lignite, etc. for distributed generation applications and {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) production at small scales {{can be improved}} by a simple technology shift. This study evaluates the technical feasibility of a compact power generation package comprising a small steam turbine directly coupled to a high-speed alternator delivering around 2 MW of electricity. Existing high-speed electrical generators at MW-scale are presented and reviewed, and a basic thermodynamic design and flow-path analysis of a steam turbine able to drive such a generator is attempted. Most importantly, the <b>speed-controlled</b> turbogenerator arrangement promises improved electrical efficiency especially at part-load (in off-design mode), compared to the typically low off-design performance of small-scale steam cycles using state-of-art fixed speed turbines. High-speed alternators with related power electronics are nowadays becoming increasingly available for the MW-size market. One such product – a commercial 2 MW permanent-magnet alternator running at 22, 500 rpm – {{has been used as a}} reference for evaluating the behavior of a <b>speed-controlled</b> steam turbine as a prime mover. The specific turbine losses due to its comparatively small size remain serious. However, a low steam parameter approach suits well for converting, for example, heat-only boilers into CHP units, adding value by local electricity production at affordable costs. Steam superheat temperatures of around or less than 350 C (660 F) would keep the steam volumetric flow sufficiently high in order to restrain the turbine losses and allow for a cost-effective electricity production for enhanced utilization of locally-available solid fuels via steam cycles. Such a steam turbine is possible to manufacture and would deliver a promising performance despite its small size. The possibility for the turbine to be <b>speed-controlled</b> and its characteristics thereof have been evaluated by computer simulations using the in-house code AXIAL by courtesy of the Swedish branch of Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery, steam turbine division. Simulation results show that a reasonable improvement in part-load performance can be achieved for the high-rpm turbine-generator drivetrain: up to 30 % better in the load spectrum down to 50 % of nominal output, if compared with a fixed-speed arrangement of similar size and parameters.

For the case of multiple different messages we prove that an extension of our online algorithm achieves competitive ratio (4 c − 1) α if the lengths of requests do not vary by more than a factor of c. For the problem variation in which the speed of running broadcasts may be changed, we present lower bounds showing that competitive ratios that depend exponentially on α are still unavoidable. ...|$|E
40|$|For high {{performance}} drive applications, {{the accuracy of}} speed estimation from a digital shaft encoder is reduced in the low speed range. Drive performance can be further impaired at low speed when low cost low-resolution digital encoders are used. This thesis contributes {{to the development of}} a quasi-sensorless solution for AC induction motor drives, where instead of a conventional position sensor and MH" or closed loop observer, an artificial intelligence based 64 PPR SKF sensor bearing is proposed. Furthermore, the performance of <b>speed-controlled</b> IM drives is sensitive to rotor time constant mismatch. A newly developed closed loop RMLE-GNA observer is proposed as a new adaption mechanism with a Model Reference Adaptive Scheme for rotor flux estimation and on-fine rotor time constant adaptation. For {{high performance}} sensorless speed controlled IM drive applications, the IM is required to operate at low speed in all four-quadrants in a stable manner whilst maintaining constant air-gap flux and torque. Such low speed operation fails with conventional open loop observers and MRAS, and closed loop observers such as EKF suffer from a tuning problem and extensive computing time. Parameter uncertainty is a further factor limiting drive performance. A new joint state estimation and parameter adaptation closed loop Recursive Maximum Likelihood Estimator with an iterative Gauss Newton Raphson Algorithm (RMLE-GNA) is developed for the sensorless speed estimation and on-line parameter adaptation of IM drives. Two case studies are presented: correct and stable convergence of the closed loop observer within two iteration local loops utilising a full order IM model, and correct and stable convergence within a single iteration local loop utilising a simplified full order IM model. In both cases it is shown that the closed loop observer can provide satisfactory and stable convergence for 4 -quadrant operation. Of particular interest are the correct convergence, robustness against parameter mismatch and the stability of the sensorless speed controlled IM drive at zero speed and zero stator flux frequency. Thus, a small signal transfer function of the closed loop observer with the sensorless speed vector controlled IM drives is derived. The stability analysis shows the robustness and the convergence of the observer for 4 -quadrant operation for high and low speed' and up to the rated load torque. The effect of various machine model parameters on the stability and convergence of the RMLE-GNA-based sensorless drive system is investigated, providing an insight into the inherent dynamic characteristics of the proposed closed loop observer-based sensorless <b>speed-controlled</b> IM drives.
