50|$|Early echosounders only {{transmitted}} {{a single}} beam of sound. Because of the acoustic beam pattern, identical targets at different azimuth angles will return different echo levels. If the beam pattern and {{angle to the}} target are known, this directivity can be compensated for. The need to determine the angle to a target {{led to the development}} of the twin-beam echosounder, which forms two acoustic beams, one inside the other. By comparing the phase difference of the same echo in the inner and outer beams, the angle off-axis can be estimated. In a further refinement of this concept, a <b>split-beam</b> echosounder divides the transducer face into four quadrants, allowing the location of targets in three dimensions. Single-frequency, <b>split-beam</b> echosounders are now the standard instrument of fisheries acoustics.|$|E
50|$|At present, {{acoustic}} {{surveys are}} used in the assessment and management of many fisheries worldwide. Calibrated, <b>split-beam</b> echosounders are the standard equipment. Several acoustic frequencies are often used simultaneously, allowing some discrimination of different types of animals. Technological development continues, including research into multibeam, broadband, and parametric sonars.|$|E

This is {{typically}} {{mounted on a}} weight transducer which can typically be a strain-gauge load cell or a servo-balance (also known as a force-balance), or sometimes known as a <b>split-beam.</b> Some older machines may pause the weigh bed belt before taking the weight measurement.

50|$|Sonar {{technologies}} developed rapidly {{during the}} Second World War, and military surplus equipment {{was adopted by}} commercial fishers and scientists soon {{after the end of}} hostilities. This period saw the first development of instruments designed specifically to detect fish. Large uncertainties persisted in the interpretation of acoustic surveys, however: calibration of instruments was irregular and imprecise, and the sound-scattering properties of fish and other organisms was poorly understood. Beginning in the 1970s and 80s, a series of practical and theoretical investigations began to overcome these limitations. Technological advances such as <b>split-beam</b> echosounders, digital signal processing, and electronic displays also appeared in this period.|$|E
5000|$|The {{larger the}} antenna is {{compared}} to a wavelength, the more lobes there will be. In a directive antenna in which {{the objective is to}} direct the radio waves in one particular direction, the lobe in that direction is larger than the others; this is called the [...] "main lobe". The axis of maximum radiation, passing {{through the center of the}} main lobe, is called the [...] "beam axis" [...] or boresight axis". In some antennas, such as <b>split-beam</b> antennas, there may exist more than one major lobe. A minor lobe is any lobe except a major lobe.|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{instruments}} are important tools for observing {{the behavior of}} aquatic organisms. This paper presents a simple but efficient method for improving the tracking of closely spaced targets using a <b>split-beam</b> echosounder. The traditional method has been a stepwise approach from the detection of echoes, rejection of apparently multiple targets and then tracking the remainder. This is inefficient because the <b>split-beam</b> angles {{are not included in}} the initial detection; rather they are only used in the rejection criteria before the subsequent tracking. A simple track-before-detection method is presented, where the phase angles, echo intensities, ranges, and times are used simultaneously, resulting in better detection and tracking of the individual fish. Two test data sets were analyzed to determine the effectiveness of this method at discriminating individual tracks from within dense fish aggregations. The first data set was collected by lowering a <b>split-beam</b> transducer into a herring layer. The second data set, also collected with a <b>split-beam</b> transducer, was from a caged aggregation of feeding herring larvae. Results indicate the potential of target tracking, using a <b>split-beam</b> echosounder, as a tool for understanding interindividual behavior...|$|E

One of the fundamental parameters of a target strength measurement, when performed on free-swimming fish, is angular orientation relative to the horizontal. This is usually defined as the tilt angle, when vertical echo sounding is conducted. The swimming angle of the targets was measured directly through <b>split-beam</b> target tracking with specialized <b>split-beam</b> hardware and software.

40|$|The use of multibeam echo {{sounders}} (MBES) {{has grown}} more frequent in applications like seafloor imaging, fisheries, and habitat mapping. Calibration of these instruments {{is important for}} understanding and validating the performance of MBES. For echo sounders in general, different calibration methodologies have been developed in controlled environments such as a fresh water tank and in the actual field of operation. While calibration in an indoor tank facility can bring excellent results in terms of accuracy, {{the amount of time}} required for a complete calibration can become prohibitively large. A field calibration can reveal the actual radiation beam pattern for shipmounted sonar systems, accounting for acoustic interferences which may be caused by objects around the installed transducers. The standard target method is a common practice for field calibration of <b>split-beam</b> echo sounders. However, when applied to a Mills Cross MBES, this method does not provide means to determine the alongship angle of the target, since the receiver transducer is a line array. A method to determine the combined transmit/receive radiation beam pattern for a ship-mounted multibeam system was developed and tested for a Reson Seabat 7125 MBES inside the fresh water calibration tank of the University of New Hampshire. This calibration methodology employs a tungsten carbide sphere of 38. 1 mm diameter as target and a Simrad EK 60 <b>split-beam</b> sonar system to provide athwartship and alongship angular information of the target sphere position. The multibeam sonar system was configured for 256 beams equi-angle mode at an operating frequency of 200 kHz; the <b>split-beam</b> system was set to work passively at the same frequency. A combined transmit/receive beam pattern was computed for an athwartship angular range between â€“ 6 o and + 6 o and an alongship angular range between â€“ 1 o and + 3 o. The limited angular range of the measurements is due to the â€“ 3 dB beamwidth of 7. 1 o in the athwartship and alongship directions of the <b>split-beam</b> sonar system coupled with the alongship offset of 1. 6 o between the maximum response axes (MRA) of the two sonar systems. Possible acoustic interferences caused by the monofilament line used to suspend the target sphere in the water column were found in the measurements for alongship angle values less than â€“ 1 o. Beam pattern measurements for the combined transmit/receive beam pattern at a distance of 8 m show a â€“ 3 dB beamwidth of 1. 1 o in the athwartship direction and a â€“ 3 dB beamwidth of 2. 0 o in the alongship direction for the most inner beams.

40|$|Tracking of {{individual}} fish targets using a <b>split-beam</b> echosounder {{is a common}} method for investigating fish behavior. When mounted on a floating platform like a ship or a buoy, the transducer movement often complicates the process. This paper presents a framework for tracking single targets from such a platform. A filter based on the correlated fish movements between pings is developed to estimate the platform movement, and an extended Kalman filter is used to combine the <b>split-beam</b> measurements and the platform-position estimates. Different methods for gating and data association are implemented and tested with respect to data-association errors, using manually tracked data from a free-floating buoy as a reference. The data association was improved by utilizing the estimated velocity for each track to predict {{the location of the}} next observation. The data association was more robust when estimates of platform tilt/roll were used.
