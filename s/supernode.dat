5000|$|DMS <b>SuperNode</b> {{featured}} increased {{processing capacity}} across a distributed architecture {{allowing for the}} development of new features and services. Each of the elements of the DMS <b>SuperNode</b> uses a common <b>SuperNode</b> CPU hardware design differing only in the software used to control them. The <b>SuperNode</b> consists of two main elements: DMS Core and DMS Bus.|$|E
50|$|The DMS <b>SuperNode</b> Computing Module {{was first}} {{based on the}} Motorola 68020 Central Processing Unit (CPU) and then {{upgraded}} to the Motorola 68030. In the early 1990s it was further upgraded to use the Motorola 88100 and 88110 Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) CPUs. This RISC version of the <b>SuperNode</b> Computing Module {{was known as the}} BRISC (BNR Reduced Instruction Set Computing) CPU. With the BRISC CPU the DMS <b>SuperNode</b> had a processing capacity of 1,500,000 call attempts per hour.|$|E
5000|$|It can {{be proved}} by {{considering}} the circuit as a single <b>supernode.</b> Then, according to Ohm and Kirchhoff, [...] "the voltage between {{the ends of the}} circuit is equal to the total current entering the <b>supernode</b> divided by the total equivalent conductance of the supernode".|$|E
50|$|<b>Supernodes</b> {{are grouped}} into slots (9-10 <b>supernodes),</b> and slots are grouped into blocks (8 slots).|$|R
30|$|V′(s) is the {{fraction}} of groups that are disconnected {{from the rest of}} the groups with respect to the total number of groups when s[*]number of <b>supernodes</b> are captured. In other words V′(s) is the ratio of the number of groups that do not have any link to other groups after the s[*]number of <b>supernodes</b> are captured to the total number of active <b>supernodes</b> present in the network before s[*]many <b>supernodes</b> are captured.|$|R
50|$|Skype was {{the first}} {{peer-to-peer}} IP telephony network. The network contains three types of entities: <b>supernodes,</b> ordinary nodes, and the login server. Each client maintains a host cache with the IP address and port numbers of reachable <b>supernodes.</b> The Skype user directory is decentralized and distributed among the <b>supernodes</b> in the network.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>supernode</b> {{contains}} two nodes, one a non-reference node and another node {{that may be}} a second non-reference node or the reference node. Supernodes containing the reference node have one node voltage variable. For nodal analysis, the <b>supernode</b> construct is only required between two non-reference nodes.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} NT40 based CCC {{was replaced}} by the compatible DMS <b>SuperNode</b> in 1987.|$|E
30|$|E′(s) {{is defined}} {{to be the}} {{fraction}} of interlinks between groups that get exposed when s number of <b>supernodes</b> are captured by the adversary. In other words, E′(s) is {{the ratio of the}} interlinks present in the grid after s[*]many <b>supernodes</b> are captured to the number of interlinks present in the network before s[*]many <b>supernodes</b> are captured.|$|R
30|$|The result proved in Theorem 9 is also {{applicable}} for the interlinks between <b>supernodes</b> {{in different}} groups. Hence, for our scheme, individual groups {{do not get}} disconnected {{from the rest of}} the network unless a large number of <b>supernodes</b> get captured.|$|R
50|$|NEM uses <b>supernodes</b> {{to form a}} {{backbone}} of support for light wallets, mobile wallets, and 3rd party apps. <b>Supernodes</b> provide access to the NEM Blockchain so that users {{can get to the}} network without having to sync to a blockchain locally.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In this circuit, VA {{is between}} two unknown voltages, and is {{therefore}} a <b>supernode.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Nortel Networks DMS-100 {{telephone}} {{central office}} switch also used the 68020 as the first microprocessor of the <b>SuperNode</b> computing core.|$|E
5000|$|Aside the [...] "normal" [...] nodes, there's {{another kind}} of nodes in the cluster, called supernodes. A <b>supernode</b> is a lite member of Hazelcast.|$|E
50|$|Skype {{originally}} {{featured a}} hybrid peer-to-peer and client-server system. Skype has been powered entirely by Microsoft-operated <b>supernodes</b> since May 2012. The 2013 mass surveillance disclosures revealed that Microsoft had granted intelligence agencies unfettered access to <b>supernodes</b> and Skype communication content.|$|R
50|$|FastTrack uses <b>supernodes</b> {{to improve}} scalability.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that this}} last step is inefficient for graphs of large treewidth. Computing the {{messages}} to pass between <b>supernodes</b> involves doing exact marginalization over the variables in both <b>supernodes.</b> Performing this algorithm for a graph with treewidth k will thus {{have at least}} one computation which takes time exponential in k.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Hub Server", {{also known}} as [...] "The King" [...] but {{technically}} a <b>supernode,</b> organizes all the other servers, decides where to create rooms and put new users, verifies logins and deals with private messages.|$|E
50|$|The {{message board}} {{can only be}} {{accessed}} within range of the hotspot. Individual Neighbornodes can be linked {{together to create a}} <b>supernode,</b> vaguely like Fidonet. It is implemented as an alternative firmware for the Linksys WRT54G router.|$|E
5000|$|If {{there are}} voltage sources between two unknown voltages, join the two nodes as a <b>supernode.</b> The {{currents}} {{of the two}} nodes are combined in a single equation, and a new equation for the voltages is formed.|$|E
40|$|Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) {{networks}} {{have grown to}} such a massive scale that performing an efficient search in the network is non-trivial. Systems such as Gnutella [1] were initially plagued with scalability problems {{as the number of}} users grew into the tens of thousands. As the number of users has now climbed into the millions, system designers have resorted to the use of <b>supernodes</b> to address scalability issues and to perform more efficient searches. While the use of <b>supernodes</b> has become commonplace in unstructured P 2 P networks, no theoretical bounds on search time have been established. We analyze search time and show that <b>supernodes</b> are required for efficient search. We also formulate the optimal reduction in search time that can be achieved by using <b>supernodes</b> and show a construction where search time of O(loglogn) is realized. ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are some}} 20,000 <b>supernodes</b> {{out of many}} {{millions}} of users logged on. Skype Guide for network administrators claims that <b>supernodes</b> carry only control traffic up to 10 kB/s and relays may carry other user data traffic up to 15 kB/s (for one audio conference call). A relay should not normally handle more than one [...] "relayed connection".|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} need to extract {{features}} from point sets for purposes like model classification, matching, and exploration. We introduce a technique for segmenting a point-sampled surface into distinct features without explicit construction of a mesh or any other surface representation. Our approach achieves computational efficiency through a three-phase segmentation process. The {{first phase of the}} process adapts a topological approach to define features and coarsens the input, resulting in a set of <b>supernodes,</b> each one representing a collection of input points. A graph cut is applied in the second phase to bisect the set of <b>supernodes.</b> Similarity between <b>supernodes</b> is computed as a weighted combination of geodesic distances and connectivity. Repeated application of the graph cut results in a hierarchical segmentation of the input. In the last phase, a segmentation of the original point set is constructed by refining the segmentation of the <b>supernodes</b> based on their associated feature sizes. We demonstrate our segmentation algorithm to capture geometric features in laser scanned models...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{many other}} VPN programs, n2n can also connect {{computers}} which reside behind NAT routers. These connections {{are set up}} with help from a third computer that both computers can reach. This computer, called a <b>supernode,</b> can then route the information between NATed nodes.|$|E
50|$|The supernodes rewards program {{allows the}} NEM {{foundation}} to reward people running active nodes. Anyone {{with a minimum}} of 3 million XEM gets paid 140,000XEM divided {{by the total number of}} supernodes (doubled from 70,000XEM) every day for running a <b>supernode</b> that meets a minimum technological requirement.|$|E
50|$|Digital Multiplex System (DMS) is {{the name}} shared among several {{different}} telephony product lines from Nortel Networks for wireline and wireless operators. Among them are the DMS-1 (originally named the DMS-256) Rural/Urban digital loop carrier, DMS-10 telephone switch, the DMS <b>SuperNode</b> family of telephone switches (DMS-100, DMS-200, DMS-250, DMS-300, DMS-500, DMS-GSP, DMS-MSC, DMS-MTX), and the S/DMS optical transmission system.|$|E

30|$|We shall now {{study the}} {{resiliency}} {{of the entire}} network taking into account all the groups, nodes, and <b>supernodes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Supernodes</b> relay {{communications}} {{on behalf}} of two other clients, {{both of which are}} behind firewalls or [...] "one-to-many" [...] network address translation.Without relaying by the <b>supernodes,</b> two clients with firewall or NAT difficulties would be unable to make or receive calls from one another. Skype tries to get the two ends to negotiate the connection details directly, but sometimes the sum of problems at both ends can prevent direct conversation being established.|$|R
50|$|In circuit theory, a <b>supernode</b> is a {{theoretical}} construct {{that can be}} used to solve a circuit. This is done by viewing a voltage source on a wire as a point source voltage in relation to other point voltages located at various nodes in the circuit, relative to a ground node assigned a zero or negative charge.|$|E
50|$|In {{peer-to-peer}} networking, a <b>supernode</b> is any node {{that also}} serves as one of that network's relayers and proxy servers, handling data flow and connections for other users. This semi-distributed architecture allows data to be decentralized without requiring excessive overhead at every node. However, the increased workload of supernodes generally requires additional network bandwidth and central processing unit (CPU) time.|$|E
50|$|The total {{equivalent}} conductance of the <b>supernode</b> {{is the sum}} of the conductance of each branch, since all the branches are in parallel. When computing the {{equivalent conductance}} all the generators have to be switched off, so all voltage generators become short circuits and all current generators become s. That is why the resistances on the branches with current generators do not appear in the expression of the total equivalent conductance.|$|E
3000|$|Here, we {{take into}} account the entire network {{consisting}} of all the nodes and <b>supernodes</b> in all the regions. Let S [...]...|$|R
30|$|A {{separate}} key predistribution {{using the}} same scheme of Section 3 is done for all the <b>supernodes</b> belonging to all the groups.|$|R
30|$|V′′(s) {{is defined}} {{to be the}} {{weighted}} average of the fractions of nodes disconnected {{from the rest of}} the network in a region (i,j) or in the set of <b>supernodes</b> when some nodes get compromised. Here, the weights are proportional to the number of pairs of uncompromised nodes present among the nodes in any region or among the <b>supernodes.</b> We propose and apply this measure for the first time for measuring the resiliency for such deployment of wireless sensor network.|$|R
