500|$|... "Cry Me a River" [...] {{received}} acclaim from critics. Jane Stevenson of Jam! and Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine regarded it as a stand-out track from Justified. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{selected the}} song as a highlight {{in his review}} of Justified. Peter Robinson of NME called it a [...] "twisted epic" [...] and [...] "an acidic, filthy little song teeming with spite and retribution, with Timbaland's pounding." [...] Rolling Stones Ben Ratliff viewed his production of [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] as exceptional. Denise Boyd of BBC Music felt that the song's lyrics play as large a role as Timbaland's production, unlike other songs on Justified. [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly concluded that the song is [...] "a genuine stunner" [...] that should leave Timberlake's fellow 'N Syncers concerned that he truly may not need them any more. John Mitchell of MTV News called [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] "kiss-off songs", with Timberlake's revenge on Spears present throughout the lyrics. Idolator staff opined it {{is the sound of}} an artist who is [...] "relishing ripping up people's perceptions of him as a sweet-natured teen heartthrob." [...] VH1's Emily Exton wrote, [...] "By stretching the boundaries of pop–and fusing it with notes of R, lots of electric goodness, and haunting choral vocals–Timberlake’s kiss-off song instantly becomes more poignant, a pointed reaction to the hurt he’s experienced by someone he once loved." [...] According to Complex, the song [...] "made people completely forget about 'N Sync and <b>start</b> <b>asking</b> what Timberlake would do next." [...] The single won a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 award ceremony. It was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards.|$|E

No." [...] The TV news anchor Rick Sanchez said: [...] "...if you start going into who is giving money to whom ... {{you have to go to}} my church.

2500|$|Baggott got {{the idea}} to write Farewell to Reality and become a science activist when {{watching}} the BBC program What is Reality. In his opinion, the program started out well, but became what he calls [...] "fairy tale physics" [...] when it included interviews with theoretical physicists who talked about such ideas as multiverse, superstring theory, and supersymmetry. These topics, according to Baggott, are fascinating to read about and are an entertaining way to make documentaries, sell books, or spend time at parties, but are [...] "abstracted, theoretical speculation without any kind of empirical foundation" [...] and [...] "not science". Farewell to Reality is Baggott's attempt to counteract the [...] "fuzzy science theory" [...] and advocate for evidence and facts. Baggott states, [...] "When you <b>start</b> <b>asking</b> 'Do {{we live in a}} hologram?' Then you are crossing into metaphysics, and you are heading down the path of allowing all kinds of things that have no evidence to back it up, like creationism." ...|$|E

He wasn't even buried yet. I thought, 'Fuck you.' I was really pissed and really angry. I said, 'Fuck Ministry and fuck you for asking.' They want to comment on Ministry when my best friend had died. It's been more than two years now, and I got more ideas and I have done albums with Mikey and have done them without him. It's time to get another record out.

She {{has been the subject of}} four television documentary specials, and several biograhies have been written about her. On her sex symbol image, Stone told Oprah Winfrey on Oprah Prime in 2014: [...] "It's a pleasure for me now. I mean, I'm gonna be 56 years old. If people want to think I'm a sex symbol, it's, like, yeah. Think it up. You know. I mean, like, good for me". In 2015, Stone posed naked for the September issue of Harper's Bazaar magazine, in which she stated: [...] "At a certain point you <b>start</b> <b>asking</b> yourself, 'What really is sexy?' It’s not just the elevation of your boobs. It’s being present and having fun and liking yourself enough to like the person that's with you".|$|E

It doesn’t know its own mind nor its own heart. It has no heart. But what if I were to <b>start</b> <b>asking</b> you—who {{have a heart}} and are not veiled to my sight?” She dropped her charming adolescent head, so firm in modelling, so gentle in expression. Her uncovered neck was round like the shaft of a column. She wore the same wrapper of thick blue silk. At that time she seemed to live either in her riding habit or in that wrapper folded tightly round her and open low to a point in front. Because {{of the absence of}} all trimming round the neck and from the deep view of her bare arms in the wide sleeve this garment seemed to be put directly on her skin and gave one the impression of one’s nearness to her body which would have been troubling but for the perfect unconsciousness of her manner. That day she carried no barbarous arrow in her hair. It was parted on one side, brushed back severely, and tied with a black ribbon, without any bronze mist about her forehead or temple. This smoothness added to the many varieties of her expression also that of child-like innocence.|$|E
