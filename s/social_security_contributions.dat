40|$|The paper {{presents}} a theoretical analysis of macroeconomic {{effects of the}} payroll tax.

The labour cost of non-regular workers is much smaller than that of regular workers. This is the main reason why firms have increased non-regular employment since 1990 s. The paper examines the macroeconomic effects when the def-erence in the labour costs between regular workers and non-regular workers becomes smaller. More precisely, the case when the government decreases the payroll tax for regular employment and the case when government introduces the payroll tax for non-regular employment are investigated...|$|R
30|$|To {{estimate}} wage cyclicality, {{we focus}} on the evolution of wages of salaried workers in the private sector and exclude therefore self-employment and public administration employees. Our wage variable records daily real wages in 2011 prices 4 for those workers that reported at least seven days of fulltime work in a given month. In this dataset, wages are proxied by the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>contribution</b> base. For most workers, this is exactly equal to the earned wage. However, the existence of an upper bound in the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>contribution</b> base makes it impossible to know the exact wage for the top part of the distribution. Hence, salaries are right-censored for some individuals. We present estimates of the cyclicality excluding right-censored wages, but our results are not affected if we include them in the dataset 5.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{a puzzle}} in the {{literature}} on labor markets in developing countries: labor legislations not only {{have an impact on the}} formal labor market but also an impact on the informal sector. It has even been argued that the impact on the informal sector in the case of the minimum wage is stronger than on the formal sector. Using quasi-experiments of minimum wage changes and thereby exploiting geographical variation of the minimum wage bite, I find evidence for this hypothesis. Informal workers, workers without <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contribution,</b> experienced significant wage increases when the minimum wage was raised while formal workers did not.

2500|$|Besides the {{argument}} {{over whether the}} returns on <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>contributions</b> should or {{can be compared to}} returns on private investment instruments, {{there is the question of}} whether the contributions are nonetheless analogous to pooled insurance premiums charged by for-profit commercial insurance companies to maintain and generate a return on a [...] "risk pool of funds". Like any insurance program, Social Security [...] "spreads risk" [...] as the program protects workers and covered family members against loss of income from the wage earner's retirement, disability, or death. For example, a worker who becomes disabled at a young age could receive a large return relative to the amount they contributed in FICA before becoming disabled, since disability benefits can continue for life. As in private insurance plans, everyone in the particular insurance pool is insured against the same risks, but not everyone will benefit to the same extent.|$|E
2500|$|In {{recent times}} {{there have been}} two major tax reforms in Norway. The first, the tax reform of 1992, was a {{pervasive}} and principle based reform, inline with the international trend of broader tax base and lower rates. Corporate taxation was designed so that the taxable profit should correspond to the actual budget surplus. [...] This meant, among other things that different industries, forms of ownership, financing methods and investment were treated equally (neutrality) and that revenues and related expenditures were subject to the same tax rate. In the personal income tax, a clearer distinction between labour income and investment income was introduced (split - a dual income tax system). Ordinary income, income less standard deductions and deductible expenses, was taxes at a flat rate of 28%. On personal income, income from work and pensions, there were in addition levied <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions</b> and surtax. To avoid that income that was taxed at the corporate level also were taxed at the individual level (double taxation), the imputation tax credit for dividends and treasury system gains was introduced.|$|E
2500|$|For this reason, {{financial}} advisers often encourage {{those who have}} the option to do so to supplement their <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>contributions</b> with private retirement plans. One [...] "good" [...] supplemental retirement plan option is an employer-sponsored 401(K) (or 403(B)) plan when they are offered by an employer. 58% of American workers have access to such plans. Many of these employers will match a portion of an employee's savings dollar-for-dollar up to a certain percentage of the employee's salary. Even without employer matches, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are portable, self-directed, tax-deferred retirement accounts that offer the potential to substantially increase retirement savings. Their limitations include: the financial literacy to tell a [...] "good" [...] investment account from a less advantageous one; the savings barrier faced by those who are in low-wage employment or burdened by debt; the requirement of self-discipline to allot from an early age the required percentage of salary into [...] "good" [...] investment account(s); and the self–discipline needed to leave it there to earn compound interest until needed after retirement. Financial advisers often suggest that long-term investment horizons should be used, as historically short-term investment losses [...] "self correct", and most investments continue to deliver good average investment returns. The IRS has tax penalties for withdrawals from IRAs, 401(K)s, etc. before the age of 59½, and requires mandatory withdrawals once the retiree reaches 70; other restrictions may also apply on the amount of tax-deferred income one can put in the account(s). For people who have access to them, self-directed retirement savings plans have the potential to match or even exceed the benefits earned by federal, state and local government retirement plans.|$|E

This encourages voters who benefit from <b>social</b> <b>security</b> to support higher contribution rates in political equilibrium.
