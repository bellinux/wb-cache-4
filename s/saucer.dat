5|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise {{is fired}} upon by a cloaked attacker, with each {{subsequent}} attack {{stronger than the}} last, straining the ship's shields. Chief Engineer Lt. Logan (Vyto Ruginis) goes to the bridge to demand that the Enterprise flee the planet and attempts to take command, as he outranks La Forge, but La Forge refuses, pointing out that Logan lacks the authority to remove him, and orders {{him to return to}} Engineering. As the attacks continue, La Forge recalls Logan to the bridge and orders a <b>saucer</b> separation, leaving Logan in charge of the <b>saucer,</b> and taking command of the star-drive section from the battle bridge himself to return to Minos.|$|E
5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the <b>saucer</b> burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the <b>saucer</b> from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} <b>saucer</b> created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The <b>saucer</b> explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E

5|$|When {{eccentric}} scientist Dr. Brackish Okun {{examines the}} alien captured by Steven, it regains consciousness and attacks. It telepathically invades Dr. Okun's mind and uses his vocal cords {{to communicate with}} Thomas before launching a psychic attack against him. Thomas sees visions of the aliens' plans: their entire civilization travels from planet to planet, exterminating all indigenous life and harvesting the planet of all natural resources. After Secret Service agents and military personnel kill the alien, Thomas reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a B-2 Spirit fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at a <b>saucer</b> positioned above Houston, but the <b>saucer</b> remains intact.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, David {{demonstrates}} {{that the key to}} defeating the aliens lies in deactivating their force fields, and devises a way to do so by uploading a computer virus into the mothership. He proposes using the refurbished alien fighter to implement the plan, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The two are able to upload the virus and deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership. With military pilots in short supply, Thomas enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, and leads an attack on a <b>saucer</b> bearing down on Area 51. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighters are able to inflict damage, but their supply of missiles is quickly exhausted. As the <b>saucer</b> prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but his attempt of firing it jams, leaving him no choice but to sacrifice his own life. He flies his plane kamikaze-style into the directed-energy weapon port, which results in an explosion that destroys the <b>saucer.</b> Human resistance forces around the world successfully destroy the other saucers using this vulnerability. As humankind is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They and military officers nearby accompany Thomas and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership burn up, resembling a fireworks display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The Independent {{newspaper}} apologised on 21 August 2006, {{writing that}} on 14 June 2006, the paper had wrongly reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by writing that Mardas {{had not been}} a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and was not sacked, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas “did not claim to have invented electric paint, a flying <b>saucer</b> or a recording studio with a ‘sonic force field’ or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas. We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors".|$|E
5|$|Filming for Never Say Never Again {{began on}} 27 September 1982 on the French Riviera {{for two months}} before moving to Nassau, the Bahamas in mid-November where filming took place at Clifton Pier, which {{was also one of}} the {{locations}} used in Thunderball. The Spanish city of Almería was also used as a location. Largo's Palmyran fortress was actually historic Fort Carré in Antibes. Largo's ship, the Flying <b>Saucer,</b> was portrayed by the yacht Kingdom 5KR, then owned by Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi and called the Nabila. Principal photography finished at Elstree Studios where interior shots were filmed. Elstree also housed the Tears of Allah underwater cavern, which took three months to construct. Most of the filming was completed in the spring of 1983, although there was some additional shooting during the summer of 1983.|$|E

5|$|He was {{a friend}} of Queen guitarist and {{astrophysicist}} Brian May, who was an occasional guest on The Sky at Night. May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing it back to him for a peppercorn rent the same day to provide financial security. May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe. In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called Flying <b>Saucer</b> from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers; Moore never admitted his involvement. He once joined the Flat Earth Society as an ironic joke.|$|E
5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or <b>saucer.</b> Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E

Worf forces Korris to reveal the truth: the three had commandeered the freighter, in order to seek out a place they could live as true Klingons, and the damage to the freighter was a result of a battle with a Klingon ship. When the two are seen near the ship's battle bridge, hoping to steal the drive section and escape the crew on the <b>saucer,</b> they are placed in the brig.|$|E

5|$|Roman domes {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow <b>saucer</b> domes, segmental domes, and ribbed domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline {{and fall of the}} western portion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|When {{paying a}} state visit to Britain, foreign {{heads of state}} are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. They are {{allocated}} a large suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite, situated {{at the foot of}} the Minister's Staircase, on the ground floor of the north-facing Garden Wing. The rooms of the suite are linked by narrow corridors, one of them is given extra height and perspective by <b>saucer</b> domes designed by Nash in the style of Soane. A second corridor in the suite has Gothic-influenced cross-over vaulting. The Belgian Rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after Prince Albert's uncle LéopoldI, first King of the Belgians. In 1936, the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by King EdwardVIII.|$|E
5|$|When the Phase II {{series was}} in development, {{original}} series designer Matt Jefferies updated the Enterprise design to feature a larger <b>saucer</b> with twin elevators (turbolifts) to the bridge, a wider secondary hull, docking ports, a dedicated photon torpedo weapon assembly {{at the base}} of the ship's neck, and angled struts supporting the nacelles. The nacelles themselves were completely changed to less cylindrical shapes and designed to feature glowing grilles on the sides. Likewise, an orbiting drydock, space office complex, and V'ger has been designed by artist Mike Minor. At the time Phase II was cancelled a roughly five foot long model of the Enterprise was under construction by Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures, and models of the drydock and V'ger were under construction as well. All of these models were abandoned, unfinished (although a Brick Price Enterprise was repurposed as the exploded Enterprise wreck in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock).|$|E

The title was later changed to Flying <b>Saucers,</b> Mysteries of the Space Age and the magazine continued until June 1976 when it ceased publication.|$|R
50|$|Wave 3: SaucersResembling flying <b>saucers,</b> {{these ships}} drop a steady rain of bombs as they fly back and forth. When destroyed, they {{sometimes}} release a larger, more powerful bomb that can unexpectedly veer diagonally. <b>Saucers</b> are 30 points each.|$|R
25|$|Donald Keyhoe later began {{investigating}} flying <b>saucers</b> for True Magazine. Keyhoe {{was one of}} {{the first}} significant conspiracy theorists, asserting eventually that the <b>saucers</b> were from outer space and were on some sort of scouting mission. Keyhoe claimed to derive his theory from his contacts in Air Force and Navy intelligence. Project Sign, based at Air Technical Intelligence Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and its successors Project Grudge and Project Blue Book were officially assigned to investigate the flying <b>saucers.</b> Edward Ruppelt's book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, reports that many people within these research groups did in fact support the hypothesis that the flying <b>saucers</b> were from outer space.|$|R
