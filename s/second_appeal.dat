5|$|Three JNA officers, Mile Mrkšić; Veselin Šljivančanin; and Miroslav Radić, {{were indicted}} by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on {{multiple}} counts {{of crimes against}} humanity and violations {{of the laws of}} war, having surrendered or been captured during 2002 and 2003. On 27 September 2007, Mrkšić was sentenced by the ICTY to 20 years' imprisonment for murder and torture, and Šljivančanin was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on charges of torture. Radić was acquitted. Šljivančanin's sentence was increased to 17 years on appeal, then reduced again to ten years after a <b>second</b> <b>appeal,</b> and he was granted early release in July 2011. Slavko Dokmanović, the Serb mayor of Vukovar, was also indicted and arrested {{for his role in the}} massacre, but committed suicide in June 1998, shortly before judgement was to be passed.|$|E
5|$|Nickell {{continued}} {{to maintain her}} innocence after her trial. An appeal based on jury-tampering and judicial misconduct issues {{was rejected by the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August 1989. A <b>second</b> <b>appeal,</b> beginning in 2001 was filed by Nickell's new attorney, Carl Park Colbert, based on evidence obtained by private detectives Al Farr and Paul Ciolino, requesting a new trial on the basis of new evidence having been discovered that the FBI may have withheld documents from the defense. The appeal was denied, though Nickell and her team continue to assert her innocence. She claimed that her daughter Cynthia lied about Nickell's involvement in the case in order to reap the $300,000 of reward money being offered. Cynthia Hamilton eventually collected $250,000 of that money. Nickell also alleges, among other things, that the evidence actually points to another person as the killer, and that the testimony about various smaller details in the case, such as the store owner who testified about her having purchased Algae Destroyer, was influenced by promises of payment.|$|E

2500|$|Under certain, limited, circumstances, <b>second</b> <b>appeals</b> are allowed. This is when {{an appeal}} {{goes to the}} High Court or County Court and {{a party to the}} case wishes to appeal it further, to the Court of Appeal. Section 55(1) of the Access to Justice Act 1999 says that, when an appeal is made to a County Court or the High Court and that court makes a decision, no further appeal is allowed to the Court of Appeal unless the Court {{considers}} that the case raises [...] "an important point of principle or practice" [...] or [...] "there is some other compelling reason for the Court of Appeal to hear it". In Tanfern Ltd v Cameron-MacDonald [...] 1 WLR 1311 the Court commented on this limitation of <b>second</b> <b>appeals,</b> pointing out that the Lords Justices of Appeal were a valuable and scarce resource – it was necessary to impose limitations on appeals to prevent the Court and its judges becoming overburdened.|$|R

5|$|On May 27, {{the governments}} of both Honduras and Nicaragua appealed for {{international}} aid. Soldiers quickly sent food and medical to at least 50 communities in both countries. A <b>second</b> <b>appeal</b> was made shortly afterwards, which proposed for $5.1million in medicine and other supplies. The red cross and United Nations (UN) appealed for $3million in international relief. The UN granted Nicaragua a month's worth of food supply, but officials feared that {{this would not be}} enough. The government of Cuba announced that they would send 12,000 construction workers as well as 2,000 teachers, doctors, and officials to Nicaragua. Canada donated $220,000via the League of Red Cross Societies. To prevent an epidemic of diseases such as typhoid fever, the Health Ministry started a program to give out vaccines which costs $5.1million. The U.S. Embassy in Managua provided $25,000in donations. The U.S. Embassy in Honduras attempted to outline a fact-fining mission to assess the damage and provide relief.|$|E
5|$|Rapid, however, appealed, {{citing the}} alleged injury to their player. The initial appeal was {{dismissed}} by UEFA, but a <b>second</b> <b>appeal</b> {{from the club}} was upheld and a replay was ordered to take place at least 150 kilometres (90 miles) from Glasgow. The Celtic board acquiesced to this decision in spite of considered opinion that Celtic should withdraw from the tournament on principle. As such, the match at Parkhead was declared void and a third match was held in Manchester at Old Trafford. Celtic lost 0–1, the goal coming on 18 minutes when after Roy Aitken had hit the post with an effort for Celtic, Rapid immediately caught Celtic on the break to score the only goal of the game. Worse, two Celtic fans assaulted Rapid Wien players; one fan running onto the pitch and accosting the goalkeeper during the game, whilst at full-time another Rapid player was kicked by a fan. UEFA fined Celtic and ordered their next home European tie to take place behind closed doors.|$|E

The Government of Canada notified Hamilton that the project would require federal environment approval, which Hamilton applied for in 1998.

A federal judicial review board sided with Hamilton, clearing the project for construction, although the federal government appealed twice to overturn the verdict. After losing the <b>second</b> <b>appeal</b> in 2001, the federal government decided not to appeal the judgment to the Supreme Court.|$|E

A {{procedural}} hearing at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh took place on 11 October 2007 when prosecution lawyers and Megrahi's defence Counsel, Maggie Scott QC, discussed legal issues with a panel of three judges. One of the issues concerns a number of CIA documents that were shown to the prosecution but were not disclosed to the defence. The documents are understood to relate to the Mebo MST-13 timer that allegedly detonated the PA103 bomb. Further procedural hearings were scheduled to take place between December 2007 and June 2008.|$|E
