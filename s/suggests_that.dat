5|$|There {{are three}} {{theories}} {{as to how}} the three races of white-winged fairywren could have evolved. The first <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> black-and-white plumage is an ancestral condition and, following separation of the three populations, blue-and-white plumage evolved in the mainland species. The second hypothesis <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> black-and-white plumage evolved convergently on the two separate islands. The third <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> black-and-white plumage evolved once from the blue-and-white ancestral condition, and later the mainland species re-evolved blue plumage.|$|E

5|$|After {{being caught}} by the Environmental Protection Agency dumping nuclear waste in the city park, Mr. Burns is fined $3 million. A town meeting is held so that the {{citizens}} can decide how to spend the money. Marge <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the city {{use the money to}} fix Main Street, which is in poor condition. The town is about to vote in favor when someone new to town, a fast-talking salesman named Lyle Lanley, <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Springfield construct a city monorail.

40|$|Over {{the last}} years {{migration}} between Mexico and the United States have been associated to the transmission of AIDS and Tuberculosis. Voices from the United States <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Mexicans are introducing Tuberculosis to their country.

The ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen was found to vary from compound to compound, which astronomers believe <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> cometary ices were formed in interstellar clouds, {{rather than in the}} solar nebula. Theoretical modelling of ice formation in interstellar clouds <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> comet Hale–Bopp formed at temperatures of around 25–45kelvins.|$|E
5|$|Existing {{evidence}} <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{water fluoridation}} reduces tooth decay.

5000|$|Raymond et al. (1992) [...] <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the attentional blink is {{produced}} by perceptual uncertainty amongst the target (T1) and following target (T2). They <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> this confusion happens {{at some point in}} the target identification processes. When confusion is eliminated, attentional blink isn’t observed. The researchers also <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> one way to eliminate confusion is to have items that cannot be named.|$|R

5|$|His biographer, Brian Little, <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{this might}} have been a way for the {{newcomers}} to become part of Bristol maritime society, as well as making it possible for Woodes Rogers to become a freeman, or voting citizen, of the city.

50|$|Endovelicus also {{protected}} the cities or region that venerated him. The epithets given to Endovelicus are deus ‘god’, sanctus ‘holy’, and praestantissimus ‘most outstanding’.

5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale.

Other theory <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the organic sediment may have been deposited in a shallow, partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification describes it as a marine source oil shale.|$|E
