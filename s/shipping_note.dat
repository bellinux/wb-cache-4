25|$|Yarmouth {{ships were}} found in most major ports {{throughout}} the world at this time, including <b>ships</b> <b>noted</b> for courageous crews such as the ship Research in 1861 and <b>ships</b> <b>noted</b> for great size such as the ship County of Yarmouth in 1884, {{one of the largest}} wooden hull ships ever built in Canada. John Patch, the son of a Yarmouth sea captain, developed and built one of the first modern screw propeller in 1832 (4 years before John Ericsson's patent). First demonstrated in Yarmouth Harbour during the summer of 1833, Patch was unsuccessful in a patent application in that year, but he continued to improve his propeller and received an American patent in 1849 which drew praise in American scientific circles. However, by 1849 there were multiple competing versions of the screw propeller. Patch never received money or recognition and died a poor man at Yarmouth in 1861.|$|R

50|$|Japanese records studied {{after the}} war listed an attack by {{minelayer}} Wakataka on a supposed United States submarine on 23 November, off Kaoe Bay, Halmahera, with the Japanese <b>ship</b> <b>noting</b> the attack produced oily black water columns that contained wood and cork splinters and later a raft was found. This is the only reported attack in the appropriate area at that time. Also, Japanese minefields are now {{known to have been}} placed in various positions along the north coast of Sulawesi (Celebes) in Capelins area, and she may have been lost because of a mine explosion.

It {{is almost always}} played on a 10×10 grid (with Cyrillic lettering, with letters «й» and «ё» normally omitted). Depending on the rules, a player {{may or may not}} take another shot on the same turn if an enemy ship is hit. Ships cannot occupy squares next to each other, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Also, the set of ships is noticeably different (see table below). The alternate designations are based on dated distinctions of ship classes, namely the number of gun decks for Age of Sail and number of funnels for earlier steam-powered <b>ships.</b> <b>Note</b> the matching size and number of decks/funnels.|$|R
