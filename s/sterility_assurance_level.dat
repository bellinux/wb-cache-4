This study aimed {{to establish a}} lower RSD for bone allografts using method 1 of International Standard Organisation 11137. 2 : 2006. This provides a database to select an RSD corresponding to an allograft's bioburden, given that the bioburden's gamma resistance is equal to or less than the standard. This can be verified by irradiating 100 allografts at a dose selected to provide a <b>sterility</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>level</b> of 10 - 2. The bioburden of our allografts was 0, which prescribed a verification dose of 1. 3 kGy. After irradiating 100 llografts, sterility tests returned no positive cultures.

Consequently, it is crucial tissue banks use procedures to militate against allograft associated bacterial and viral infections.

A total dose of 50 kGy assures that the current standard for medical devices for a microbial <b>sterility</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>level</b> of 106 is met. Furthermore, the pathogen inactivation technology results in a greater than four log inactivation of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses.

40|$|Polysaccharides {{are highly}} {{heat-sensitive}} macromolecules, so high temperature treatments are greatly destructive and cause considerable damage, {{such as a}} great decrease in both viscosity and molecular weight of the polymer. The technical feasibility of the production of exopolysaccharides by deep-sea bacteria Vibrio diabolicus and Alteromonas infernus was previously demonstrated using a bioproduct manufacturing process. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine which sterilization method, other than heat sterilization, was the most appropriate for these marine exopolysaccharides and was in accordance with bioprocess engineering requirements. Chemical sterilization using low-temperature ethylene oxide and a mixture of ionized gases (plasmas) was compared to the sterilization methods using gamma and beta radiations. The changes to both the physical and chemical properties of the sterilized exopolysaccharides were analyzed. The use of ethylene oxide can be recommended for the sterilization of polysaccharides as a weak effect on both rheological and structural properties was observed.

40|$|AbstractLiposomes {{have been}} widely {{researched}} as a delivery system {{and there have been}} many manufacturing techniques used in the production of liposomal preparations, the most common being extrusion method which will be introduced in this paper. However because of the unique properties of liposomes and their susceptibility to chemical and physical degradation, sterilisation remains an unresolved issue in the manufacturing of liposome-based formulations. It is especially pertinent in the pharmaceutical industry where liposomes are commonly prepared for intravenous administration. Currently, filtration and aseptic manufacturing are recommended for the preparation of sterile liposomal products. Newer aseptic manufacturing techniques such as dense gas techniques have been devised to eliminate the need for terminal sterilisation. This paper will highlight the limitations of the conventional techniques that are specific to the liposome preparation under the respective sterilisation conditions specified by the 2011 British Pharmacopoeia to achieve 10 − 6 <b>Sterility</b> <b>Assurance</b> <b>Level,</b> as well as modifications incorporated in the newer sterilisation technologies to overcome these limitations.

40|$|The <b>sterility</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>level</b> (SAL) {{was first}} {{developed}} by the food canning industry. In order to demonstrate sterility, since {{it is impossible to}} sample all canned items after moist heat sterilization. A safety factor was established incorporating the kinetics of inactivating bacterial spores that would give an equivalent of a 12 -log spore reduction. In the 1960 ’s the Swedish public health authority required a stated SAL of 10 - 6 (probability of 1 viable organism per 1, 000, 000 products) for medical devices labeled “sterile”. Currently SALs are used to measure sterilization process efficacy and apply to terminally-sterilized medical products. Objectives The intent is to determine what are acceptable SALs for new/emerging health care products such as combination products (medical device with a pharmaceutical and/or biologic component), devices with materials that cannot withstand traditional terminal sterilization processes, and products that are cell-and tissue- based.

40|$|Microbial {{contamination}} of whole human saliva is unwanted for certain in vitro applications, e. g., when utilizing it as a growth substratum for biofilm experiments. The {{aim of this}} investigation was to test gamma irradiation for its suitability to sterilize saliva and to investigate the treatment’s influence on the composition and integrity of salivary proteins in comparison to filter sterilization. For inhibition of bacterial growth by gamma irradiation, a <b>sterility</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>level</b> of 106 was determined to be reached at a dose of 3. 5 kGy. At this dose, the integrity of proteins, as measured by fluorescence, circular dichroism, and gel electrophoretic banding pattern, and the enzymatic activities of salivary amylase and lysozyme were virtually unchanged. Filtration reduced the total protein concentration to about half of its original value and decreased lysozyme activity to about 10 %. It can be concluded that irradiation is suitable for sterilizing whole saliva in its native form. Saliva, a complex biological fluid, is essential for the pro-cessing of food and maintenance of health in the oral cavity and the upper digestive tract (20). Many of these beneficial functions are mediated by the numerous proteins present in saliva (12, 41) that also modulate the microbial colonization o...|$|E
40|$|For several decades, {{a dose of}} 25 kGy of gamma {{irradiation}} {{has been}} recommended for terminal sterilization of medical products, including bone allografts. Practically, {{the application of a}} given gamma dose varies from tissue bank to tissue bank. While many banks use 25 kGy, some have adopted a higher dose, while some choose lower doses, and others do not use irradiation for terminal sterilization. A revolution in quality control in the tissue banking industry has occurred in line with development of quality assurance standards. These have resulted in significant reductions in the risk of contamination by microorganisms of final graft products. In light of these developments, there is sufficient rationale to re-establish a new standard dose, sufficient enough to sterilize allograft bone, while minimizing the adverse effects of gamma radiation on tissue properties. Using valid modifications, several authors have applied ISO standards to establish a radiation dose for bone allografts that is specific to systems employed in bone banking. These standards, and their verification, suggest that the actual dose could be significantly reduced from 25 kGy, while maintaining a valid <b>sterility</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>level</b> (SAL) of 10 - 6.
