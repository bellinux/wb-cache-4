40|$|Pultruded FRP (fibre {{reinforced}} polymer) {{materials have}} {{attracted the attention}} of civil engineers with their high <b>strength</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> and environmentally friendly production and use. Mechanical analysis of pultruded FRP profiles is complex since the material is anisotropic and becomes more complex when thin FRP dedicated hollow cross sections are involved. This is particularly relevant with square or rectangular construction forms where the corners of the material are suspected to produce weak points under compressive loading. FRPs are also believed to behave contrarily when subjected to heat and thermal duress. This research investigates problems in predicting their behaviour under compression (hollow square pultruded FRP sample) using different analytical and modelling approaches. The mechanical behaviour of the material is investigated under different thermal conditions through finite element simulation and the results are then compared with previously conducted laboratory research analysis. The large deformation in anisotropic materials is simulated to provide better prediction regarding the failure mechanism of this material. Finite element simulation is then used to estimate the performance of similar and often competitive construction materials to GFRP (i. e. : wood, concrete and steel) under similar thermal and compressive duress...|$|E
40|$|Composites are {{emerging}} as realistic {{alternatives to the}} metal alloys in many applications like automobiles, marine, aerospace applications, sports goods, etc. Fiber composites offer many advantages such as low specific gravity, tensile strength and modulus, compressive strength and modulus, better fatigue strength, etc. Due to the low specific gravity the <b>strength</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> and modulus weight ratio of these composite materials are markedly superior to those of metallic materials.

40|$|Concrete {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extensively}} used materials within the construction industry. Aggregates make up 70 - 80 % of the concrete mixture, making them the most important components in concrete production; this factor has unavoidably led to an increasing demand in sourcing these natural materials used for their production. The consumption of natural resources develops a growing concern into the sustainability of these practices and a need to preserve these by possibly partially replacing there resources with alternative materials which are recycled or waste materials. This thesis was conducted to explore the use of recycled automotive tyre rubber as a partial replacement for fine aggregates in concrete construction. The initial part of this thesis the background of the study and the extent of the problem were explored, a review of relevant literature into previous studies within this area was completed. The experimental research for this thesis was begun by conducting tests on the raw materials to determine their properties and suitability for their use in this thesis. Concrete mix designs were then prepared using the Design of Normal Concrete Mixes Second Edition, and a total of 4 mix designs were developed 3 with percentage replacements of fine aggregate of 5 %, 10 % & 15 % of rubber aggregate by volume as well as one control mix with no replacement of fine aggregate was produced for a comparative analysis. Laboratory tests were conducted on the prepared concrete mixes and test cylinders including; slump, unit weight and compressive strength tests, the test results were compared with the respective conventional concrete properties. The background reading into previous studies and the experimental work completed during this thesis were analysed and it can be concluded that the introduction of crumb rubber into the concrete mixture can decrease the compressive strength in comparison to conventional concrete. However, the presence of the higher levels of moisture in the crumb rubber and its low unit weight in comparison to traditional aggregates have shown potential for an increase in workability, impact resistance, the <b>strength</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> and overall flexibility of the concrete. These favourable properties can potentially develop a large market for the rubberized concrete making it a suitable material for such applications as architectural and interior construction, areas where shock wave absorbing or vibration damping is necessary and where resistance to impact or explosion is required. The overall results show that it is possible to use recycled rubber tyres in concrete construction as a partial replacement for fine aggregates, nevertheless, the percentage of replacement should be limited to a specified amount and the application should be restricted to particular cases where the improved properties due to the rubber aggregates are desirable and when the corresponding demerits of the rubber aggregates don’t affect the use of the structure. To understand the extent of the capability of this composite construction material further study has to be done to achieve a standard for the mix design of this relativity unexplored technology...|$|E
