5000|$|The second point, {{related to}} the first, was that the workers wanted to be paid fairly in legal tender, not with <b>company</b> <b>scrip.</b>|$|R
2500|$|These {{companies}} were very paternalistic. Company towns (colloquially {{referred to as}} [...] "coal patches") were established, company stores founded and workers often paid in <b>company</b> <b>scrip.</b>|$|R
50|$|Workers {{from the}} factory worked 6 days a week in 10 hours shifts and were issued <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> in various {{denominations}} that were usable in the only store in the village on Commerce street that was also owned by the company.|$|R
50|$|<b>Company</b> <b>scrip</b> is scrip (a {{substitute}} for government-issued legal tender or currency) issued {{by a company}} to pay its employees. It can only be exchanged in company stores owned by the employers. In the UK, such truck systems have long been formally outlawed under the Truck Acts.|$|R
50|$|The session made {{a number}} of changes {{affecting}} the railroads. The hiring of railroad police was authorized. The session also granted a ten year tax exemption to new railroads. Conversely, railroads in the territory were prohibited from having employees work more than 16 consecutive hours. Other industries were also affected. A tax exemption promoting the construction of storage dams and sugar beet processing facilities was passed. Opening of saloons within 6 mi of public works was prohibited. The practice of paying employees with tokens, <b>scrip,</b> or <b>company</b> store credits instead of legal tender was banned. An eight-hour work day was also implemented by the session.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} holds {{documents from}} the company which the public can view. Other items in the building include crank telephones, oak desks, dictaphones, inkwells, and adding machines. The paymaster's office is located near an entrance; workers were paid in <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> which they could use to purchase items from the company store. The second story of the building was a residence.|$|R
50|$|Lumber <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> was redeemable in lumber as well {{as other}} merchandise. According to the Wisconsin Historical Society, such an option may have appealed to new {{settlers}} in the region, who worked in the lumber camps in winter to earn enough money to establish a farm. Taking some of their wages in lumber may have helped them build a much-needed house or barn.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Company</b> <b>scrip</b> was {{a credit}} against the accrued wages of employees. In the United States, where {{everything}} in a mining or logging camp was {{owned and operated by}} a single <b>company,</b> <b>scrip</b> provided the workers with credit when their wages had been depleted. These remote locations were cash poor. Workers had very little choice but to purchase food and other goods at a company store. In this way, the company could charge enormous markups on goods in a company store, making workers completely dependent on the company, thus enforcing their [...] "loyalty" [...] to the company. Additionally, while employees could exchange scrip for cash, this could rarely be done at face value. This kind of scrip was valid only within the settlement where it was issued. While store owners in neighboring communities could accept the scrip as money, they rarely did so at face value, as it was worth less than that.|$|R

50|$|Mill {{workers were}} paid in cash, {{but they could}} also opt to be paid {{partially}} in <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> {{to be used in}} the company store. Truly unique for its time, Avondale Mills offered employees $1 of scrip for only 80¢. This, effectively, gave employees a 20% discount on all goods bought at the village store as the village store matched its prices with those of stores in downtown Birmingham.|$|R
50|$|In 1883, {{thousands}} of European immigrants {{and a large}} number of African Americans migrated to southern West Virginia to work in coal mines. These coal miners worked in company mines with company tools and equipment, which they were required to lease. Along with these expenses, the miners were deducted pay for housing rent and items they purchased from company stores. Many coal companies paid miners with <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> (private money), good only at company-owned stores.|$|R
50|$|The {{working classes}} were formed by {{saltpeter}} workers, industrial workers and workers in public works, {{as well as}} landless peasants. The first lived in the North, in huts made of Calamina, where differences in temperature between day and night spanned 30 degrees Celsius. Others workers lived in conventillos (dormitories) or in round quarters (rooms without windows or lighting). Peasants lived in ranches. All worked without contract between 12 and 16 hours daily without Sunday sabbath. Some were paid by <b>company</b> <b>scrips.</b>|$|R
50|$|Trona {{was officially}} {{established}} in 1913, as a self-contained company town, wholly operated by its resident mining company to house employees. Employees were paid in <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> instead of cash. The mining company also built a library, a scrip-accepting for-profit grocery store, a school, basic housing, and minimal recreation facilities. The Trona Railway {{was built in}} 1913-14 to provide the town with a rail connection to the Southern Pacific (now the Union Pacific) line at Searles. The railway still operates today.|$|R
50|$|Miners {{in remote}} coal camps were often {{dependent}} upon the company store, a store that miners had to use because they were often paid only in <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> or coal scrip, redeemable at the store, which often charged higher prices than other stores. Many miners' homes were also owned by the mines. Although there were company towns that raised the prices of all goods and made eviction a constant threat, these conditions were not the norm for all coal towns—some owners were paternalistic and others were exploitative.|$|R
5000|$|Scrip (sometimes in India called [...] ) is a {{term for}} any {{substitute}} for legal tender and is often a form of credit. Scrips have been created for payment of employees under the truck system, and for use in local commerce at times when regular currency was unavailable, for example in remote coal towns, military bases, ships on long voyages, or occupied countries in wartime. Besides <b>company</b> <b>scrip,</b> other forms of scrip include land scrip, vouchers, token coins such as subway tokens, IOUs, arcade tokens and tickets, and points on some credit cards.|$|R
5000|$|Najeeb Basha {{immigrated to}} the United States from Lebanon in 1886; {{he and his wife}} Najeeby moved to Arizona in 1910. The family {{struggled}} for years in retail sales in the Arizona mining towns of Ray and Sonora, facing numerous setbacks, but remained determined to succeed. The first store to officially incorporate the Bashas name opened in 1932 in Goodyear, Arizona, as a company store. Employees of J. G. Boswell could purchase groceries with <b>company</b> <b>scrip.</b> Bashas was founded by Najeeb and Najeebys sons, Ike Basha and Eddie Basha, Sr.|$|R
50|$|Scripted is {{an online}} {{marketplace}} that connects businesses with freelance writers for blogs, articles, and bulk social media posts. Located in San Francisco, co-founders Sunil Rajaraman and Ryan Buckley launched Scripted as {{a byproduct of}} their scriptwriting <b>company</b> <b>Scripped.</b> Scripted pays freelance writers a flat rate to create articles, press releases, website copy, social media posts, blog posts, and copywriting for various clients. According to Techcrunch, Scripted has a pool of more than 80,000 freelancers as of November 2011, with 80% of those writers U.S. based. The company also {{ranks as one of}} the top five largest writer communities on the Internet.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1930s, The Curtis Publishing Company, {{published}} several magazines, {{including the}} Saturday Evening Post and the Ladies Home Journal. These magazines {{were distributed to}} subscribers through a delivery network that used youths, primarily boys, to go around to the individual houses. The boys received a small commission but, in return for meeting certain sales targets, they could also receive <b>company</b> <b>scrip,</b> comprising green and brown vouchers. These vouchers were usually known as [...] "greenies" [...] and [...] "brownies". Five greenies equalled one brownie. The greenies and brownies could be redeemed against goods from the company's catalogue.|$|R
5000|$|A truck {{system is}} an {{arrangement}} in which employees are paid in commodities or some money substitute (such as vouchers or token coins, called in some dialects scrip or [...] ) {{rather than with}} standard money. This limits employees' ability to choose how to spend their earnings - generally {{to the benefit of}} the employer. As an example, <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> might be usable only for the purchase of goods at a company-owned store, where prices are set artificially high. The practice has been widely criticized as exploitative because there is no competition to lower prices. Legislation to curtail it, part of the larger field of labour law and employment standards, exists in many countries (for example, the British Truck Acts).|$|R

[...] An additional immediate legacy of the second Gowen expansionist presidency was the payment in <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> for labor and supplies in May 1884 and an accompanying new fall in the value of Reading Railroad securities. On June 2, 1884, although Gowen was no longer president of the Reading, the company again passed {{as a direct result of}} his adventuristic management into bankruptcy and the hands of receivers, including this time not Gowen but his hand-picked successor as president, George deB. Keim.|$|R
5000|$|The Russian-American Company (RAC) (full name- [...] "the Russian-American Company {{under the}} Protection of His Imperial Majesty") was {{chartered}} by Russian Tsar Paul I on 8 July 1799. This 20-year charter granted the RAC an exclusive monopoly for {{any and all}} produce from (primarily the fur trade) {{as well as the}} general administration of colonial Russian America. Each of the five main districts (New Archangel, Kodiak, Unalaska, Ross, and Northern Islands) housed a RAC store which only accepted <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> and charged a 35% markup on basic commodities. RAC employees and local native hunters were paid in company script redeemable only at company stores. Though first made of thick card stock, this scrip was later made from parchment and walrus hide.|$|R

25|$|With {{the start}} of the 22nd Legislature in January 1903, Brodie {{requested}} several changes to the territorial tax code. The first change he asked for was increasing the tax rates for mining operations which the Governor felt were not paying a fair share in comparison {{to other parts of the}} territorial economy. He also proposed an exemption from taxation of 10 years for new railroads and 9 years for hydroelectric dams to encourage additional transportation and electrical generation capabilities within the territory. Other changes to mining operations were the establishment of an eight-hour day for mine workers, with railroad workers receiving a limit of 16 consecutive hours of work, and outlawing the practice of paying miners in <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> redeemable only at the company store. Brodie also requested the pay for the governor's secretary be increased from US$125 to US$150/year.|$|R
5000|$|To {{ensure that}} mill hands were and {{remained}} loyal the owners {{required them to}} verbally profess loyalty, sign a non-compete clause, and before ruled illegal, a Yellow-dog contract {{that they would not}} join a union. Blacklisting was also used and the cooperation between mills meant that when someone was blacklisted they {{would not be able to}} work for any mill. Another card many mills used was paying in <b>company</b> <b>scrips.</b> Scrips were only good at the mill worked at so if someone was terminated they would have no place they could go to work at, no place to stay, and no money. This was compounded even more if a mill worker had family, and gave mill owners an absolute power and Timber magnates showed they could be vindictive. A strike would also result in a lockout and outside workers brought in.|$|R
50|$|The {{negotiations}} of a {{code for}} the bituminous coal industry came {{against the background}} of a rapidly swelling union, the United Mine Workers headed by John L. Lewis and an unstable truce in the Pennsylvania coal fields. The NRA tried to get the principals to compromise with a national code for a decentralized industry in which many companies were anti-union, sought to keep wage differentials, and tried to escape the collective bargaining provisions of section 7A. Agreement among the parties was finally reached only after the NRA threatened that it would impose a code. The code did not establish price stabilization, nor did it resolve questions of industrial self-government versus governmental supervision or of centralization versus local autonomy, but it made dramatic changes in abolishing child labor, eliminating the compulsory <b>scrip</b> wages and <b>company</b> store, and establishing fair trade practices. It paved the way for an important wage settlement.|$|R
50|$|Until 1870, large merchants {{filled the}} role of the {{non-existent}} banks of New Mexico. Large purchases often involved the use of property as security, in essence, mortgage banking. The Spiegelbergs issued their own highly respected <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> as substitutes for legal tender in 1863, when the territorial legislative assembly granted a provisional charter to create the Bank of New Mexico, but failed to gain congressional approval. Levi Spiegelberg was among the ten prominent New Mexicans seeking that charter. In 1870, the First National Bank of New Mexico received a charter under Lucien Maxwell in Santa Fe, which was taken over within months by Thomas B. Catron, one of the largest individual landholders in U.S. history, with Stephen Benton Elkins and others. The Spiegelbergs quickly formed the Second National Bank of New Mexico in 1872, with principal (and majority interest holding) stockholders, Lehman and Willie in Santa Fe, and Solomon and Levi, in New York.|$|R
25|$|In 1890, the {{election}} of {{several members of the}} labor-friendly Tennessee Farmers' Alliance among them Governor John P. Buchanan to the state government emboldened miners in the Coal Creek Valley to make several demands. One of the key demands was payment in cash rather than <b>company</b> <b>scrip,</b> which could either be used only at company-owned stores with marked up prices or redeemed for cash at a percentage of its value. Miners also demanded they be allowed to use their own checkweighmen the specialists who weighed the coal and determined how much a particular miner had earned instead of checkweighmen hired by the company. Since state laws already barred scrip payment and company-hired checkweighmen, most mine owners accepted the demands, though they {{were in the midst of}} an economic downturn. However, the Tennessee Coal Mining Company (TCMC), which operated a mine near Briceville, rejected the demands, and on April 1, 1891, shut down operations. Two months later, the company demanded its miners sign an iron-clad contract before returning to work. The miners refused.|$|R

50|$|The Liberal Party of Mexicos (PLM) 1906 {{political}} program {{proposed a}} number of reforms that were incorporated into the 1917 Constitution. Article 123 incorporated its demands for the 8-hour day, minimum wage, hygienic working conditions, prohibitions on abuse of sharecroppers, payment of wages in cash, not <b>scrip,</b> banning of <b>company</b> stores, and Sunday as an obligatory day of rest. Article 27 of the Constitution incorporated some of the PLMs demands for land reform in Mexico. Requiring landowners to make all their land productive, and if left idle, subject to government expropriation; the granting of a fixed amount of land to anyone who asks for it, provided they bring it into production and not sell it. Points in the PLMs call for improvement in education were also incorporated, such as completely secular education, compulsory attendance up until age 14, {{and the establishment of}} trade schools. Not surprisingly, the PLM also called for restrictions on the Roman Catholic Church, which were incorporated in the constitution. These included treating religious institutions as businesses and required to pay taxes; nationalization of religious institutions real property; and the elimination of religious-run schools.|$|R
25|$|Largely due to {{the company}} nature of the settlement, {{development}} was slow, with the first bank not opening until 1859 and the town's first newspaper being printed in 1876. Until the National Bank established the first branch in Kooringa, most exchange was either {{in the form of}} <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> or at shops operating as money exchanges. All towns, except Kooringa, were built outside the mining lease but were still close to the mine as it was at the northern edge of the lease. The formation of the townships was forced by the refusal of SAMA to grant any freeholds within Kooringa, so miners began moving into other townships from the end of 1849. During their early lives each of the townships largely had their own hotels, churches, post offices, schools, and shops and identity. In 1851 the gold rush near Bathurst, New South Wales, emptied the town of many miners. Whole families, government officials and other townspeople left for the gold fields and by 1854 the town appeared largely deserted. The number of townships increased dramatically {{as a result of an}} 1858 proposal to extend a railway line from Gawler. When the railway failed to be built most of the new townships failed and, in 1876, the remaining townships formed the Corporation of Burra.|$|R
5000|$|Coal mining {{has been}} {{integral}} to the region and its economy. One feature of the Appalachian coal mines was the existence of company towns. In the company towns, the coal companies provided the “municipal” services, owned the homes and the stores, where the accepted currency was usually <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> (despite laws in some states against it [...] ) and the prices were excessive. [...] Some of these towns were described by the U.S. Coal Commission in 1922 as being {{in a state of}} disrepair “beyond the power of verbal description or even photographic illustration, since neither words nor pictures can portray the atmosphere of abandoned dejection or reproduce the smells.” [...] Eventually union struggles occurred in these towns; in central Appalachia miners battled to unionize the mines from the 1890s to the 1940s and fought again from the late 1970s to 1999. [...] Some company towns tried to become models of social welfare, in order to dissuade workers from unionizing. [...] Nonetheless, “mine wars” erupted, strikes that turned into deadly battles when the company tried to protect strikebreakers, including in Matewan, West Virginia on May 19, 1920. [...] The unionization of the Appalachian coal mines is a long, complex story, spanning decades.|$|R
40|$|A UK {{company may}} give its {{shareholders}} {{the option to}} elect to receive additional shares in the company {{in lieu of a}} cash dividend. The share alternative is referred to as a scrip dividend. Scrip dividends offer tax savings to some UK companies, and may be beneficial to certain shareholders. The type of company that can benefit from scrip dividends is one that has structural surplus advance corporation tax (ACT). This may arise because the company distributes either foreign source profits or preference income (income that is subject to tax). There has been a {{decline in the number of}} companies with structural surplus ACT over the past ten years. This has been largely due to the reduction of preference income following the Finance Act of 1984. On the basis of the analysis presented in the paper it is expected that companies with structural surplus ACT will offer scrip dividends and, as the number of companies in this position has declined over the past decade, there will be a reduction in the number of <b>companies</b> offering <b>scrip</b> dividends. A <b>company</b> without structural surplus ACT obtains a timing benefit rather than a tax savings by offering scrip dividends. As there are costs in offering scrip dividends, it is expected that companies without structural surplus ACT will not offer scrip dividends. The results of the study show that the scrip dividends became popular amongst UK companies when fewer companies had preference income as the effect of the Finance Act of 1984. Also, contrary to expectations, companies without structural surplus ACT offer scrip dividends. Possible explanations for these results are discussed in the paper. The tax rules on scrip dividends make a scrip dividend equivalent to the value of the net cash dividend unattractive to some groups of shareholders. It is therefore expected that the take-up of the scrip alternative will be low. This is confirmed by the results of the stud...|$|R
50|$|During a {{visit in}} October 1845 to Burra by Henry Ayers and the {{directors}} of SAMA {{the site of the}} township of Kooringa was chosen. George Strickland Kingston surveyed and laid out the township, completing it in April 1846, and named many of the streets after directors of SAMA. From the beginning the township was a company town, built at low cost and with insufficient housing, which forced many miners to dig makeshift homes. In the census of 1851 over a third of the population were living along the creek and the census compiler took time to note:There are no houses, the dwellings being excavated in the banks of the Burra Creek.Largely due to the company nature of the settlement, development was slow, with the first bank not opening until 1859 and the town's first newspaper being printed in 1876.

50|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Oakes Murphy as Governor of Arizona Territory, Brodie was nominated for the position and sworn into office on July 1, 1902. His first several months were spent appointing new officials and organizing his administration. An action of note prior to the convening of the 22nd Arizona Territorial Legislature was the pardon of Pearl Hart on moral grounds. At the time, the outlaw was the only female at the Yuma Territorial Prison and her presence was causing disruptions as guards and other prisoners vied for her attentions. The December 1902 pardon was made {{on the condition that}} Hart leave the territory, a condition she quickly fulfilled. Another display of the new Governor's ethical stance was his refusal to use a US$750 discretionary fund which was available for his personal use. Brodie considered the legislative appropriation which created the fund illegal as it had no oversight provisions to prevent misuse.With the start of the 22nd Legislature in January 1903, Brodie requested several changes to the territorial tax code. The first change he asked for was increasing the tax rates for mining operations which the Governor felt were not paying a fair share in comparison {{to other parts of the}} territorial economy. He also proposed an exemption from taxation of 10 years for new railroads and 9 years for hydroelectric dams to encourage additional transportation and electrical generation capabilities within the territory. Other changes to mining operations were the establishment of an eight-hour day for mine workers, with railroad workers receiving a limit of 16 consecutive hours of work, and outlawing the practice of paying miners in <b>company</b> <b>scrip</b> redeemable only at the company store. Brodie also requested the pay for the governor's secretary be increased from US$125 to US$150/year.Other legislation coming from the session were laws requiring the licensing of dentists and physicians, requiring schools to fly the United States flag during hours the school was in session, expanding the facilities of the territorial insane asylum, and authorizing school districts with 1,000 or more residents to hire music and art instructors. Brodie also took unpopular stances on two of the session's bills. The first stance was opposition to a bill granting women the right to vote. Brodie, who personally supported women's suffrage, opposed this bill on the basis that it was not permitted under the limitations of the Arizona Organic Act. The second unpopular stance was endorsing a bill supporting joint statehood with New Mexico.|$|R
