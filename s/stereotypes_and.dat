5|$|Charlie Chan is {{a fictional}} {{character}} created by Earl Derr Biggers. Biggers loosely based Chan on Honolulu, Hawaii, detective Chang Apana, and conceived of the benevolent and heroic Chan {{as an alternative}} to Yellow Peril <b>stereotypes</b> <b>and</b> villains like Fu Manchu. Chan is a detective for the Honolulu police, though many stories feature Chan traveling the world as he investigates mysteries and solves crimes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the team}} name of Eastern Michigan University {{changed from the}} Hurons to the Eagles in 1991, the change {{remained}} controversial as some students and alumni sought to restore it. In 2012, the university president brought back the Hurons logo, which was placed inside flap a of the band uniforms, along with another historic logo, with the stated intent of recognizing the past. However, {{the return of the}} Hurons logo has prompted protests from Native Americans at the university and in the local community, who state that the old mascot promotes <b>stereotypes</b> <b>and</b> hostility.|$|E
5|$|Avoiding <b>stereotypes</b> <b>and</b> {{labeling}} {{based on}} personal dress, the program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as uniforms. Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, which is a visible reminder of the program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell {{at the conclusion of}} the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens the impact on a person's personal wardrobe.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the role}} {{is subject to}} many <b>stereotypes,</b> <b>and</b> men may have {{difficulties}} accessing parenting benefits, communities, and services targeted at mothers, it became more socially acceptable by the 2000s. The stay-at-home dad was more regularly portrayed in the media by the 2000s, especially in the United States. However, due to traditional family structures and stereotypic expectations, the stay at home father figure is culturally unacceptable in countries in South Asia such as India.|$|E
5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out <b>stereotypes</b> <b>and</b> bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{panel is}} {{regarded}} as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by <b>stereotypes</b> <b>and</b> were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.|$|E

5|$|Dragon Ball {{has become}} one of the most {{successful}} manga series of all time. Its collected volumes have sold over 156 million copies in Japan and more than 240 million worldwide, making it the second best-selling manga series. Regarded as one of the most influential manga series, Dragon Ball has inspired artists including Eiichiro Oda (One Piece), Masashi Kishimoto (Naruto) and Tite Kubo (Bleach). Critical reception to the series has been mostly positive. Reviewers have praised the comedy and fight scenes while recognizing the coming-of-age theme and the use of cultural references from Chinese mythology and Japanese folktales. Complaints from parents in the United States resulted in English-language releases being edited to remove nudity, potentially racist <b>stereotypes,</b> <b>and</b> other content.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment dropped {{every year}} since the program's {{inception}} such that, when compounded by dropouts, the program was below half-capacity three years later. UW President Glenn Frank had warned of decreased enrollment in August 1928 and of its consequences for the college. UW College of Letters and Science Dean George Sellery offered support conditional on codified discipline and uniform final exams, which Meiklejohn refused. Sellery later refused to allow transfer students into the college. Meiklejohn wrote letters to Wisconsin high schools in April 1929 that acknowledged the college's <b>stereotypes</b> <b>and</b> welcomed demographic change, but the campaign backfired. He sent an adviser to tour the state and solve {{what he saw as}} a communication issue. The adviser found high school seniors largely interested in vocational training, and that the prospect of traditional college excited students {{to the point where they}} did not consider improvements upon that model. The adviser found students uninterested in the Experimental College's prospects.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative <b>stereotypes,</b> <b>and</b> limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E

5|$|The {{strategies}} of gay activists {{were once again}} split. David Goodstein and other professional gay men paid an advertising agency to outline their message, which focused on the threat to privacy {{and the rights of}} teachers. In The Advocate, Goodstein urged gays not to live up to <b>stereotypes</b> <b>and</b> let the professionals try to win. However, grassroots efforts by longtime activists such as Morris Kight, who went on a walk across the state to promote voting down the Briggs Initiative, were also effective. Women were highly visible in the campaign, raising about {{the same amount of money}} as men. However, when California law was revealed to state that anyone who gave more than $50 to the campaign would have to release his or her name, most of the donations came in at $49, including one by Rock Hudson.|$|E
5|$|Gender plays a {{large role}} within Fielding's moral critique, and effeminacy is a means to emphasise a male character's moral {{shortcomings}} or problematic deviations from social and cultural traditions. Starting with Love in Several Masques, the stock characters that he relies on emphasise the deviations by recalling traditional behavioural <b>stereotypes</b> <b>and</b> in their commentary on the masculinity or femininity of other characters. The political implications for gender extend to a criticism of powerful female within the domestic and public domains. Many of the problems portrayed within the plays are {{the results of the}} domestic sphere extended into politics, especially within Tom Thumb. As Jill Campbell points out, not only does Fielding critique women in power, but the reversals of gender and power serve as a way to say that private concerns are taking priority over public concerns. In his plays and his novels, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans, which includes both emotions and morality. Although Fielding sometimes uses females to express ideal ways to act, he does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality to dominate and assume power. This theme appears as early as Love in Several Masques and continues throughout, especially in prose parody Shamela where Shamela falsifies claims to virtue to control and get ahead in life.|$|E

40|$|<b>Stereotype</b> <b>and</b> most-popular {{recommendations}} are widely neglected in the research-paper recommender-system and digital-library community. In other domains such as movie recommendations and hotel search, however, these recommendation approaches have proven their effectiveness. We were interested {{to find out}} how <b>stereotype</b> <b>and</b> most-popular recommendations would perform in the scenario of a digital library. Therefore, we implemented the two approaches in the recommender system of GESIS’ digital library Sowiport, in cooperation with the recommendations-as-a-service provider Mr. DLib. We measured the effectiveness of most-popular <b>and</b> <b>stereotype</b> recommendations with click-through rate (CTR) based on 28 million delivered recommendations. Most-popular recommendations achieved a CTR of 0. 11 %, <b>and</b> <b>stereotype</b> recommendations achieved a CTR of 0. 124 %. Compared to a “random recommendations” baseline (CTR 0. 12 %), and a contentbased filtering baseline (CTR 0. 145 %), the results are discouraging. However, for reasons explained in the paper, we concluded that more research is necessary about the effectiveness of <b>stereotype</b> <b>and</b> most-popular recommendations in digital libraries...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} factors that {{contribute}} to the complexity of barriers that women face in their career advancement. Some female professionals face gender <b>stereotyping</b> <b>and</b> bullying in the workplace. Stereotypes influence the unequal sharing between women and men of working time, income and family responsibilities. They also constitute barriers to women&rsquo;s career advancement and appointment to decision-making positions. The focus of this study is on two of these factors: gender <b>stereotyping</b> <b>and</b> bullying. Gender <b>stereotypes</b> are the beliefs and attitudes that are presumed to distinguish between women and men (Rollero, Glick &amp; Tartaglia, 2014), while bullying can be referred to as the repeated acts of an individual or group with the intention to harm an individual holding an inferior position of power (Goldsmid &amp; Howie 2014). While these two separate issues can occur independent of one another and in combination, gender based <b>stereotyping</b> <b>and</b> bullying both form critical barriers to female professionals. This study explores the experiences of gender <b>stereotyping</b> <b>and</b> bullying of thirteen senior managers in Australia (eight women and five men). It fills a gap in the literature by connecting women&rsquo;s experiences to strategies to overcome the barriers and move ahead. The strategies women in this study used to attempt to address gender <b>stereotyping</b> <b>and</b> bullying were education, networking, mentoring and behaviours such as adopting masculine leadership and communication styles and using impression management tactics such as physical presentation and dress...|$|R

40|$|The {{constructs}} of belief and memory have become closely in-tertwined in contemporary research on stereotyping.

The theme of this book prompts a glance at the consequences of the relationship between belief and memory in experimental social psychology, the field that laid claim to a rigorous understandig of how beliefs about social groups shape judgments of their members. s <b>Stereotyping</b> <b>and</b> Prejudice In the connection that developed between the social psychological study of belief and the cognitive study of memory, the concept of stereotype came to be demystified in two fundamental ways.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{represents}} a “developing ” perspective on <b>stereotyping</b> <b>and</b> <b>stereotypes.</b> The paper briefly introduces a less popular and potentially new theory or perspective on stereotyping, a process or social phenomenon {{often seen as}} a highly undesirable and negative in modern society. The author cites cultural dimension theory, socialization, social learning, cultural syncretism, and other sociological and behavioral processes and theories as having both elements <b>and</b> bases for <b>stereotyping</b> <b>and</b> <b>stereotypes.</b> The author agues that these processes {{by their very nature}} make stereotyping natural, if not a legitimate rationale approach to human relationships, interaction, and communication in the process of knowing each other as well as self more fully. This perspective does not underscore the negative aspects <b>and</b> consequences of <b>stereotyping</b> <b>and</b> <b>stereotypes</b> as we have come to know them in our modern society and everyday living. The author also proposes a Social Competitive Theory of Stereotypes to further explain the “usefulness ” from a Darwinian and materially oriented Malthusian perspective- resources competition makes stereotyping a necessity. The author recommends further consideration on the views presented in this paper, and if possible, further research into the positive perspective or view of <b>stereotyping</b> <b>and</b> <b>stereotypes</b> as serving an important social function...|$|R
