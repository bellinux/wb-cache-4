Woods wrote, [...] "I know what it's like to be different and to sometimes not fit in.

500|$|Sire Records {{allowed the}} band between $25,000 and $30,000 to fully record and produce the album, {{which is a}} {{considerably}} larger budget compared to the band's previous albums. The band {{spent most of the}} money Sire had given them on the album's production value. The studio rent was $150 per hour, usually using the first take of a song as its final recording. Johnny explained that [...] "it's best to do it quickly... You do not wanna <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> bullshit. It's your money they're spending." ...|$|E

500|$|In Februaryâ€“March 1907, Andranik went to Vienna to {{participate}} in the fourth ARF Congress. The ARF, which had been associating with Turkish immigrant political groups in Europe since 1902, discussed and approved the negotiations with the Young Turkswho later perpetrated the Armenian Genocideto overthrow Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Andranik strongly denounced this cooperation and left the party. In 1908, the ARF asked Andranik to move to Constantinople and nominate his candidacy in the Ottoman parliament election, but he declined the offer, saying [...] "I don't want to <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> do nothing". Andranik distanced himself from active political and military affairs for several years.|$|E
500|$|After his conviction, Chandler {{was named}} by media {{as one of}} Florida's most notorious criminals. He said that his last words before his {{execution}} would be: [...] "Kiss my rosy red ass". In May 2011, comparisons were drawn between Chandler's case and trial in 1994, and the murder case and the upcoming trial of Casey Anthony. In both cases heightened media attention forced the selection of jurors who lived outside the county where the crime had been committed. One of the jurors in Chandler's 1994 trial, identified as Roseann Welton, said that: [...] "He scared some of the jurors when he would <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> stare at you and have that stupid grin on his face. He would make your skin crawl." ...|$|E

He and his father pilot Striker Eureka, [...] "the strongest and the fastest" [...] Jaeger with eleven Kaiju kills, and make up the Resistance's [...] "go-to team". Kazinsky, a fan of science-fiction, was initially drawn by the film's concept, [...] "My immediate reaction was 'Holy crap, that's cool.' In the hands of somebody else, you might <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> go, 'Well, this might be terrible,' but with del Toro doing it, you kind of go, 'This {{is going to be}} amazing.'". Reflecting on his experience in the film, Kazinsky said in an interview, [...] "The most fun I have ever had in my entire life was Pacific Rim, playing Chuck was incredibly fun." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from what I would do, and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
500|$|Stefani had an {{emotional}} breakdown from difficulties collaborating {{with many other}} artists and songwriters, so No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal invited her to his house. Kanal {{had been working on}} a track, which later became [...] "Crash", the sixth single from the album. However, the two were unable to write anything following that, because they had differing ideas of how the music should sound. Stefani commented that [...] "it was just frustrating and embarrassing to <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> think we could write songs." [...] Six months later, the two returned to work and came up with the beginnings of a song while working in Kanal's bedroom. The two experimented with combining various melodies and including what Stefani referred to as [...] "this really kinda fast rappy part". This was the last song she and Kanal wrote together for the album.|$|E

5000|$|The band's second album, called Ik wil meer (I Want More), {{contains}} the singles [...] "Nederland" [...] ("The Netherlands"), [...] "Zij zit daar en ik zit hier" [...] ("She Is <b>Sitting</b> <b>There</b> <b>and</b> I Am <b>Sitting</b> Here"), and [...] "Lachen en mooi zijn" [...] ("Smiling and Being Pretty"). Meanwhile, Vander linden {{developed a reputation}} as writer. Thanks to his success in the Studio Brussel radio programme Collage, he has frequently been asked to be a columnist and spoken-word performer.|$|R
500|$|The group {{subsequently}} enlisted Ryan Tedder, Paul Epworth, Declan Gaffney, and long-time collaborator Flood to {{help them}} complete the album, hoping their opposing perspectives from Burton would benefit the songs. Flood's time working on the record briefly overlapped with Burton's, and Gaffney served as U2's recording engineer for {{the entirety of the}} album sessions, but otherwise the group worked with each producer separately. Tedder initially critiqued in-progress songs and identified which ones were [...] "worth chasing because [...] had a limited amount of time". He compared himself to a music critic in the way he had [...] "to <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> tear their songs apart and give [...] honest opinion". Tedder alternated between working remotely and joining the band in the studio. One of the songs that he changed most was [...] "Every Breaking Wave", as he devised a new chorus melody and moved the old one to the song's bridge.|$|E
500|$|Greil Marcus {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} disregarding one's initial reading of the song. [...] "The first impression is that Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is {{coming to terms with}} unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because [...] "the time has passed when people are interested in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll just <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> watch the river flow... even though that's not quite what he's saying". For Marcus, [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is a compelling work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} of Stankonia began in spring of 1999 and lasted {{for about a}} year. Owning a studio helped the band expand creatively, as the duo {{did not need to}} worry about time constraints that would occur with a rented studio. AndrÃ© 3000 observed, [...] "You can <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> fuck with just a kick and a snare all day long if you want to... You're not working on the clock. [...] Really, you're just working on your mind." [...] Big Boi spent the majority of the recording time in the studio, while AndrÃ© 3000 worked at home, creating beats and experimenting with an acoustic guitar. [...] One song that came from a jam session on the guitar was [...] "Ms. Jackson", the album's second single. [...] AndrÃ© 3000 also created song lyrics by writing words on the walls of his home: [...] "I had planned to paint my house anyway; writing on the walls was just something I would do." [...] One stray lyric on his wall eventually developed into [...] "Gasoline Dreams".|$|E

500|$|Fall Out Boy {{began writing}} {{material}} for a possible successor shortly {{after the release of}} the 2007 album, Infinity on High. In March 2008, the band attempted to enter the Guinness Book of World Records for being the only musical act to perform in all seven continents in nine months, planning to perform in Antarctica for an audience of scientists. However, the group was unable to make the flight from Punta Arenas, Chile to Antarctica due to poor weather. Despite this unsuccessful attempt, the group felt energized from the experience and became inspired to write more music. This led to more material to sift through when the band decided to enter the studio. Fall Out Boy spent time during June 2008 formulating ideas at Avron's home, where [...] "three to four" [...] song ideas were developed. Lead vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump and bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz began turning these ideas into songs over the following month. Wentz explained that the process was the same as usual: [...] "I'll go over to Patrick's house and he'll kind of just <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> play songs, and I'll be like, 'Ah, that one's awesome!'" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1969, {{his first}} {{official}} {{year on the}} track, he won the All American Futurity and eight other stakes races. In winning the All American, he led from the start on a sloppy, muddy track. His jockey, Willie Lovell, explained {{that he needed to}} do very little to win: [...] "In the stretch, when I saw Easy Jet had it, I let him run his own race. All I had to do was just <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> let him roll." [...] His time of 20.46seconds to cover [...] was remarkable considering that three days of rain {{before the start of the}} race had turned the track into a muddy quagmire. At another stakes, the Ribbon Futurity at Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Easy Jet won by three-quarters of a length and set a new track record of 16.92seconds for [...] The only time in 1969 he did not finish first, second, or third, he had issues in the starting gate, false-started, broke some teeth loose against the front of the gate, and was struggling to stand up again when the gates opened; he still managed to finish fifth out of ten horses.|$|E
500|$|At the 1963 {{convention}} of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. Albert Ellis tell them that [...] "the exclusive homosexual" [...] was a psychopath. Articles and essays in The Ladder sometimes carried these viewpoints, since {{it was difficult to}} get psychiatrists and doctors to address homosexuality in any form. Gittings said, [...] "People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. And they talked about a cure...We'd <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward." [...] However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did gay activist Frank Kameny, making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, [...] "My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny came along and he said plainly and firmly and unequivocally that homosexuality is no kind of sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality...Suddenly I found that I was looking at things that had happened in the past in a very different light and I was taking a position that was increasingly diverging from DOBâ€™s positions." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} gained a {{significant}} amount of airplay on the BET and MTV networks, as it increased mainstream notice and appeal of D'Angelo upon the release of Voodoo in January 2000. Viewer response to the [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] music video was largely divided along sexual lines, as female viewers generally expressed favor to the video. Additionally, D'Angelo's video appearance, including a notable amount of sweating around his abdomen, contributed to rumors of him receiving oral sex in the video. For an April 2000 article for Vibe, Questlove interviewed D'Angelo and asked him [...] "Are you getting head in that video?", after which D'Angelo responded by laughing. Questlove then asked [...] "So you're not going to answer that?", and D'Angelo responded, [...] "No". In her response to the video, television personality Star Jones said that, [...] "D'Angelo is singing about being intimate with a woman that he loves, and it's just basic voice and body, and when you're in an intimate situation with a man, that's really all that's there â€” the voice and the body and the light hitting the body {{in a way that makes}} you know that this is your man". Danyel Smith, editor for Time Inc. at the time, said [...] "It's so sexy. It's about time that girls had something luscious to look at while they're listening to a song. For years, men have been treated to breasts and butts along with their favorite songs, and women have had to just <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> endure." [...] In an interview for The New York Times, Smith also said that she had encountered an appreciative reaction among women to the adult sexuality of the music video. She continued, recalling her experience at a salon where the video was viewed, stating: ...|$|E
500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I can't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those guys like Tony Gwynnâ€”they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E
