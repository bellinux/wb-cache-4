5|$|A {{ridge of}} low Jurassic hills {{runs through the}} county, {{separating}} the basins of the Welland and Nene rivers. The county has good communications as it is crossed by two main railway lines and the M1 motorway, and it has many <b>small</b> <b>industrial</b> centres rather than large conurbations. The main architectural feature is its country houses and mansions.|$|E
5|$|Trent Mill Industrial Estate, on {{the edge}} of the town near Rushcroft, takes its name from the mill that was once there.

5|$|Jacob Loucks Devers {{was born}} on 8 September 1887, in York, Pennsylvania, a <b>small</b> <b>industrial</b> town in the southeastern corner of the state. His parents were Philip Devers, a watchmaker and partner in a jewelry store, and Ella Kate Loucks Devers, a homemaker. He {{was the first of}} the couple's four children. He had two younger brothers, Frank and Phillip, and a younger sister, Catherine, known as Kitts. The Devers, of Irish and German-Alsatian ancestry, were strict, hardworking and religious. The family belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran Church, which did not believe in smoking or drinking. While {{providing}} a comfortable middle-class life for their children, the couple taught them to value dependability, integrity and industriousness.|$|E
5|$|The large {{remaining}} building currently {{stands in}} amongst a <b>small</b> <b>industrial</b> estate {{at the foot}} of the nearby Lemington Glass Cone. Along with the neighbouring Ironworks site, it is owned by Norland Construction, a crane and plant company formerly known as Reeds Cranes and Plant, the building used as storage for their machinery. The site is thought to be contaminated with coal products, fuels and oils such as PCBs, as well as dioxins and furans. In 2003, Newcastle City Council released plans that they hoped to redevelop the site for heritage tourism in the future.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Sélestat {{had a total}} {{population}} of 19,332, which makes it the eighth most populous town in Alsace. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance {{it was the third}} largest city in the region, after Strasbourg and Colmar, and it is ranked the third commune in Alsace for cultural heritage. Sélestat was founded in the 8th century as a port on the Ill and it experienced a long period of prosperity thanks to the trade in wine and a thriving religious and cultural life. It gradually declined after the Reformation and the French conquest in the 17th century. The town eventually experienced a new demographic growth {{in the second half of}} the 20th century when it became a <b>small</b> <b>industrial</b> and cultural centre.|$|E
50|$|The area {{includes}} a large industrial estate, {{which includes the}} main Walkers Crisps factory and Office Depot, {{as well as a}} <b>smaller</b> <b>industrial</b> estate to the south.|$|R
40|$|In {{last two}} decades, the <b>small</b> scale <b>industrial</b> sector, due to various reasons, has {{increasingly}} received attention from Indonesian policy makers. In the research area, rural <b>small</b> scale <b>industrial</b> activities {{play an important}} role, yet in a varying way. Production factors like labour and capital {{as well as the}} degree of localism are used to illustrate the differences in character. Attention is also paid to the linkages of those <b>small</b> scale <b>industrial</b> units with other units and sectors. Based on the main characteristics and the function of those rural <b>small</b> scale <b>industrial</b> activities, a distinction is made between basic and non-basic activities. A short description is given of the most important government programmes in the sphere of <b>small</b> scale <b>industrial</b> development. It is concluded that policy makers have given insufficient attention to the differences within the sector. As a result, most of the <b>small</b> scale <b>industrial</b> units are deprived of the programmes which are specifically designed for them...|$|R
5000|$|From {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the narrow lots came into other use, first for {{construction}} of <b>smaller</b> <b>industrial</b> enterprises and later apartment buildings, although the last bleacher did not disappear until 1867.|$|R
5|$|Route62 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with the off-ramp from U.S. Route 46 eastbound and Passaic County Route 646 {{in the community}} of Totowa. The highway heads northward along Union Boulevard, intersecting with the on-ramp from Route 62 to U.S. Route 46 eastbound. The route heads across a long bridge over the eastbound and westbound divided lanes of Route 46. After crossing the bridge, Route 62 heads into a <b>small</b> <b>industrial</b> part of Totowa, where it intersects with the off-ramp from the westbound lanes of Route 46. The highway continues northward, interchanging with Furler Street and Lackawanna Avenue on a partial cloverleaf. Route 62 continues along Union Boulevard, becoming a divided highway. The highway crosses over Interstate 80 at interchange 55A, where the route's designation terminates. The route continues into Paterson as County Route 646.|$|E
5|$|The smog was {{compared}} to the 1948 smog in Donora, Pennsylvania and the Great Smog of London of 1952, both of which lasted five days. The London smog's death toll of 4,000 was far higher than Donora, but the smog in Donora was far more severe; {{at the time of}} its smog, Donora was a <b>small</b> <b>industrial</b> town with a population of only 13,000, and its population was proportionally hit much harder with 20 deaths and smog-related illnesses among 43 percent of the population. Pollution experts estimated that if a smog as strong as the Donora smog had occurred in the much more populous New York City, the death toll could have been as high as 11,000 with four million ill.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Montpelier {{came under the}} control of the Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels were reduced further, down to two booking clerks, four porters, a checker and a weighbridge operator by 1950. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. The goods yard at Montpelier closed on 18 November 1965, with the signal box following on 10 May 1967. Staff were completely withdrawn on 17 July 1967 with tickets issued by the train guard. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the northern track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the southern platform. The former goods yard is now a <b>small</b> <b>industrial</b> estate. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth.|$|E
