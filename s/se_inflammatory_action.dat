40|$|When {{injected}} intraperitoneally into mice in doses {{larger than}} those used clinically, all the amino derivatives of bisphosphonates (aminoBPs) tested induce a variety of inflammatory reactions such as induction of histidine decarboxylase (HDC, the histamine-forming enzyme), hypertrophy of the spleen, atrophy of the thymus, hypoglycaemia, ascites and accumulation of exudate in the thorax, {{and an increase in}} the number of macrophages and/or granulocytes in the peritoneal cavity of blood. On the other hand, dichloromethylene bisphosphonate (Cl 2 MBP) a typical non-aminoBP, has no such <b>inflammatory</b> <b>actions.</b> In the present study, we found that this agent can suppress the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>actions</b> of aminoBPs. Cl 2 MBP, when injected into mice before or after injection of 4 -amino- 1 -hydroxybutylidene- 1, 1 -bisphosphonic acid (AHBuBP; a typical aminoBP), inhibited the induction of HDC activity by AHBuBP in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The increase in HDC activity induced by AHBuBP was largely suppressed by the injection of an equimolar dose of Cl 2 MBP. Cl 2 MBP also inhibited other AHBuBP-induced inflammatory reactions, as well as the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>actions</b> of two other aminoBPs. However, Cl 2 MBP did not inhibit the increase in HDC activity induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We have previously reported that AHBuBP augments the elevation of HDC activity and the production of interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) that are induced by LPS. These actions of AHBuBP were also inhibited by Cl 2 MBP. Based on these results and reported actions of bisphosphonates, the mechanisms underlying the contrasting effects of aminoBPs and Cl 2 MBP, a non-aminoBP are discussed. The results suggest that combined administration of Cl 2 MBP and an aminoBP in patients might be a useful way of suppressing the inflammatory side effects of aminoBPs...|$|R

On the contrary, due to its local <b>inflammatory</b> <b>action</b> the IUCD may disrupt a normal endometrial colonisation even if the uterine walls are not in contact. The removal of the IUCD a couple of months postoperatively should be done very gently in order to avoid any endometrial trauma during its retrieval.

40|$|Hypercholesterolemia and overt {{atherosclerotic}} disorders {{have been}} associated with a low-grade inflammation that involves not only the intrinsic cells of the artery wall, but also circulating cells.

Recent findings on the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>actions</b> of platelets have opened new perspectives in the comprehension of the pathogenetic mechanism(s) of atherosclerosis. Stimulated platelets, in fact, actively synthesize proinflammatory cytokines which have been all involved in the inflammatory process associated to hypercholesterolemia and plaque development. In this context, increasing evidence suggests that interrelated inhibition of inflammation and thrombosis induced by statins could largely contribute to clinical benefits from lipid-lowering therapy...|$|R
30|$|The {{response}} to inflammation comprises the consecutive release of mediators and the enlistment of circulating leukocytes, such as macrophages, that become stimulated at {{the area of}} inflammation, thereby releasing various types of mediators and cytokines with either pro- or anti-inflammatory actions, such as IL- 1 β, IL- 6, NO, TNF-α and PG (Day 2002; Feldmann et al. 1996). These inflammatory mediators have either pro- or anti- <b>inflammatory</b> <b>actions</b> (Bessis and Boissier 2001). Cytokines incite the chemotactic efflux of monocytes, granulocytes, mast cells and lymphocytes to tissues to support antigen elimination and tissue revival (Eigler et al. 1997; Ershler and Keller 2000). Excessive leakage and stimulation of cells induce tissue damage, resulting in pain and edema (vascular perfusion), which are similar in appearance to inflammation.|$|R
40|$|Objective 　To {{investigate}} the expression and {{mechanism of action}} of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS 3) in liver tissue of rats with experimental severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) concurring with liver injury. Methods 　The rat model of SAP was reproduced by retrograde injection of 4 % sodium taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct. Thirty-two male SD rats were randomly assigned into 4 groups (8 each) : normal control group (NC), SAP 6 h, 12 h, and 18 h groups. The levels of serum amylase (AMY), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured dynamically. The concentrations of IL - 6 and IL - 18 were determined by ELISA. The localization and expression of SOCS 3 protein in liver were determined by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. Results 　Compared with NC group, the serum levels of AMY, ALT and AST increased significantly in SAP groups (P < 0. 05), and there was significant difference among SAP groups. The serum concentrations of IL- 6 and IL- 18 increased significantly in the SAP groups than in NC group (P < 0. 05), and there was significant difference among SAP groups. Compared with NC group, the concentration of SOCS 3 protein increased significantly in SAP groups, and increased gradually along with the increased duration of pancreatitis (P < 0. 05). A minor expression of SOCS 3 protein was found in NC group. The change in SOCS 3 protein concentration {{was consistent with the}} severity of liver injury as well as the serum concentrations of IL- 6 and IL- 18. Conclusions 　The <b>inflammatory</b> <b>action</b> induced by SAP concurring with liver injury may induce the expression of SOCS 3 in liver tissue, and it may increase in intensity along with the severity of liver injury and inflammatory reaction. The mechanism may be attributed to a negative feedback regulation of the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>action</b> mediated by JAK/STAT pathway...|$|R
30|$|The NrF 2 /Keap- 1 {{signaling}} pathway {{plays a key}} role in the regulation cell’s survivability by improving natural antioxidant levels in the body under stress condition.

30|$|Because NO, LT and PGE 2 are {{the main}} factors {{promoting}} inflammation and pain, the inhibition of the biosynthesis of these inflammatory intermediaries by blocking the TNF-α-NO, PGE 2 -COX 2 and 5 -LOX-LT pathways, which are the primary pathways responsible for their <b>inflammatory</b> <b>action,</b> is hypothesized to be a promising approach for reducing undesired inflammatory effects. Although corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert an inhibitory effect on these pathways (Hunskaar and Hole 1987), most NSAIDs exhibit an unwanted side effect on the central nervous, renal, coagulation, cardiovascular and immune systems and the gastrointestinal tract (Rainsford 1999; Mukherjee et al. 2001).

Similarly, we were not able to identify any difference regarding paracrine angiogenic or <b>inflammatory</b> <b>actions</b> between hyperuricemic PRP and normal PRP in tenocytes [13].

40|$|The X-linked {{inhibitor}} of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is {{a potent}} caspase inhibitor, {{best known for its}} anti-apoptotic function in cancer. During apoptosis, XIAP is antagonized by SMAC, which is released from the mitochondria upon caspase-mediated activation of BID. Recent studies suggest that XIAP is involved in immune signaling. Here, we explore XIAP as an important mediator of an immune response against the enteroinvasive bacterium Shigella flexneri, both in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrate {{for the first time that}} Shigella evades the XIAP-mediated immune response by inducing the BID-dependent release of SMAC from the mitochondria. Unlike apoptotic stimuli, Shigella activates the calpain-dependent cleav-age of BID to trigger the release of SMAC, which antagonizes the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>action</b> of XIAP without inducing apoptosis.

40|$|Tumour {{necrosis}} factor-α (TNF-α) is {{a highly}} pleiotropic cytokine with effects on multiple pathological and physiological functions via two distinct receptors, TNFR 1 and TNFR 2. Much of the pro- <b>inflammatory</b> <b>action</b> of TNF-α is mediated by TNFR 1 whereas TNFR 2 is thought to play an immunoregulatory and tissue protective role. Anti-TNF- α biologics have been extremely successful in treating a number of immune mediated pathologies, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. However, anti-TNF therapy {{has been shown to}} induce systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriasis in some patients, and to be deleterious in multiple sclerosis. It is hypothesized that these paradoxical effects of anti-TNF-α are due to inhibition of TNFR 2 signalling. In this review, we will focus on the biology and pathophysiologic role of TNF-α and on the therapeutic implications of targeting TNF-α receptor signalling...|$|R
40|$|Monocytes play {{a central}} role in the immune system by {{producing}} and reacting to different soluble factors. Cytokine dysregulation is an hallmark in HIV-infected individuals and it is one of the most significant factors leading to impaired immunity in HIV/AIDS disease. This study investigates the possibility of modulation in the secretion of some inflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by HIV p 17 in monocytes. The results show that p 17, while ineffective on resting monocytes, exerts an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>action</b> on IL- 4 mediated inhibition of TNF-alpha and IFN- gamma production induced by IL- 15 stimulation. In addition, p 17 is able to reduce MIP- 1 alpha secretion, but unable to influence IL- 6 production.

40|$|AbstractOxidative stress {{within the}} {{arthritis}} joint has been indicated {{to be involved}} in generating mediators for tissue degeneration and inflammation. COX- 2 is a mediator in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>action,</b> pain and some catabolic reactions in inflamed tissues. Here, we demonstrated a direct relationship between oxidative stress and Cox- 2 expression in the bovine synovial fibroblasts. Furthermore, we elucidated a novel mechanism, in which oxidative stress induced phosphorylation of MAPKs and NF-κB through TAK 1 activation and resulted in increased Cox- 2 and prostaglandin E 2 expression. Finally, we demonstrated that ROS-induced Cox- 2 expression was inhibited by supplementation of an antioxidant such as N-acetyl cysteamine and hyaluronic acid in vitro and in vivo. From these results, we conclude that oxidative stress is an important factor for generation of Cox- 2 in synovial fibroblasts and thus its neutralization may be an effective strategy in palliative therapy for chronic joint diseases...|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} link between intake of marine fatty acids (omega 3) and {{inflammation}} in the body. It is a big and steadily growing field of resource. And {{it is clear that}} we are in the beginning of establishing this link because many questions are still unanswered. What we do know is that the omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids arachidonic acids gives rise to the eicosanoid family of mediators. These mediators are prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes. They have pro <b>inflammatory</b> <b>actions</b> in them selves and also regulate productions of cytokines. Intake of long chain n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids decreases the amount of arachidonic acid in the cell membranes and so decreases the substrate for eicosanoid production. Thus an intake of EPA decreases the amount of pro inflammatory eicosanoids. The latest resource shows that for this effect to be clinical significant, the doses must be higher then the public recommendations...|$|R

30|$|Cytokine {{activation}} following {{major surgery}} is a well-established phenomenon [1, 2]. IL- 6 could be induced by several intraoperative stimuli and its levels inter-related with increased severity of tissue trauma, degree of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>action,</b> and complications [1 – 3, 17]. Inflammatory reaction may affect postoperative functional outcome in TKA. IL- 6 secretion by fibroblasts {{found in a}} normal reparative process was associated with an exaggerated proliferation of fibroblast that led to arthrofibrosis [7]. Ugras et al. reported a correlation between intra-articular IL- 6 level and functional outcome scores. They concluded that control of local inflammatory response is important for an early functional recovery [6]. Several modalities for reducing postoperative inflammation have been explored. A minimally invasive TKA procedure resulted in less traumatized tissue and a faster recovery of range of motion after TKA [4]. Reducing inflammatory responses via multimodal approaches intraoperatively linked to alterations in catabolic responses delivered a better postoperative outcome [5].|$|R
