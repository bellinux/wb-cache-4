40|$|We {{consider}} {{classes of}} multivariate distributions which can model skewness and are closed under orthogonal transformations. We review {{two classes of}} such distributions proposed in the literature and focus our attention on a particular, yet quite flexible, subclass {{of one of these}} classes. Members of this subclass are defined by affine transformations of univariate (<b>skewed)</b> <b>distributions</b> that ensure the existence of a set of coordinate axes along which there is independence and the marginals are known analytically. The choice of an appropriate m-dimensional <b>skewed</b> <b>distribution</b> is then restricted to the simpler problem of choosing m univariate <b>skewed</b> <b>distributions.</b> We introduce a Bayesian model comparison setup for selection of these univariate <b>skewed</b> <b>distributions.</b> The analysis does not rely on the existence of moments (allowing for any tail behaviour) and uses equivalent priors on the common characteristics of the different models. Finally, we apply this framework to multi-output stochastic frontiers using data from Dutch dairy farms. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of several <b>skewed</b> and symmetric <b>distributions</b> in modeling the tail behavior of daily returns and forecasting Value at Risk (VaR). First, we used some goodness of fit tests to analyze which distribution best fits the data.

The results show that the <b>skewed</b> <b>distributions</b> outperform the normal and Student-t (ST) distribution in fitting portfolio returns. Following a two-stage selection process, whereby we initially ensure that the distributions provide accurate VaR estimates and then, focusing on the firm´s loss function, we can conclude that <b>skewed</b> <b>distributions</b> outperform the normal and ST distribution in forecasting VaR. From the point of view of the regulator, the superiority of the <b>skewed</b> <b>distributions</b> related to ST is not so evident.
