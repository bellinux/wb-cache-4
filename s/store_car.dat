2500|$|Asda {{rebuilt the}} West Bridgford store in 1999, {{adjacent}} to the old site which was demolished and {{is now part of}} the current <b>store</b> <b>car</b> park. The Preston store was based {{on the ground floor of}} a converted mill which had been occupied by a supermarket called Fame prior to GEM taking over, and then subsequently Asda. The mill was demolished in the mid-1980s when Asda opened two new purpose-built superstores in the area. One was in the centre of Preston located at the Fishergate Shopping Centre, which closed in 1992, less than seven years after opening due to poor trading. And the second was located in the suburban district of Fulwood. The Fulwood store is still trading today and is a very popular store. The Cross Gates store in Leeds was closed in 1992, along with the Whitkirk and Wortley [...] stores, and their replacement was a large superstore built in the Killingbeck area of the city which had opened in the autumn of 1991. The Wortley store ended up being sold to Netto UK in 1992, but was rebought when Asda acquired the Netto chain in 2011, to become part of its small supermarket division.|$|E

50|$|In {{the last}} decade of the 19th century, the pond was used by the American Ice Company as an ice {{harvesting}} site. City authorities considered the industrial use of Beaver Pond a health hazard as its outflow contributed to the Brooklyn Water Works. In April 1906, a grand jury in Queens recommended that the city fill in this “menace to the community and a drawback to the material progress of that section of Jamaica.” Although Beaver Pond was filled, land atop the site remained undeveloped for another couple of decades. It is zoned for manufacturing with auto repair shops, slaughterhouses and undeveloped lots used to <b>store</b> <b>car</b> parts. Beaver Road, which follows the former pond’s northern shore is the only physical reminder of this body of water.|$|E

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the application of}} the LBL`s End-use Disaggregation Algorithm (EDA) to a DoD installation and presents hourly reconciled end-use data for all major building types and end uses. The project initially focused on achieving these objectives and pilot-testing the methodology at Fort Hood, Texas. Fort Hood, with over 5000 buildings was determined to have representative samples of nearly all of the major building types in use on DoD installations. These building types at Fort Hood include: office, administration, vehicle maintenance, shop, hospital, grocery store, retail <b>store,</b> <b>car</b> wash, church, restaurant, single-family detached housing, two and four-plex housings, and apartment building. Up to 11 end uses were developed for each prototype, consisting of 9 electric and 2 gas; however, only electric end uses were reconciled against known data and weather conditions. The electric end uses are space cooling, ventilation, cooking, miscellaneous/plugs, refrigeration, exterior lighting, interior lighting, process loads, and street lighting. The gas end uses are space heating and hot water heating. Space heating energy-use intensities were simulated only. The EDA was applied to 10 separate feeders from the three substations at Fort Hood. The results from the analyses of these ten feeders were extrapolated to estimate energy use by end use for the entire installation. The results show that administration, residential, and the bar-rack buildings are the largest consumers of electricity for a total of 250 GWh per year (74 % of annual consumption). By end use, cooling, ventilation, miscellaneous, and indoor lighting consume almost 84 % of total electricity use. The contribution to the peak power demand is highest by residential sector (35 %, 24 MW), followed by administration buildings (30 %), and barrack (14 %). For the entire Fort Hood installation, cooling is 54 % of the peak demand (38 MW), followed by interior lighting at 18 %, and miscellaneous end uses by 12 %...|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The aims of the project were: to provide {{an evaluation of the}} nature of 'food deserts' in British cities as a contribution to the social exclusion and health inequalities debates and their policy implications; to design and conduct, within one strategically chosen area of poor retail access in Leeds, a major 'before/after' (baseline and follow-up) study {{of the impact of the}} opening of a large new food store on a group of low-income households. The study required a major and potentially extremely difficult exercise in social survey research, involving a two-wave food diary/household questionnaire survey, focused on the kind of deprived urban area known to pose enormous problems regarding response and attrition rates for social survey research. The survey design consisted of two waves: pre-intervention (June/July 2000), approximately five months 'before' the opening of a new supermarket food store in November 2000, and post-intervention (June/July 2001), seven/eight months 'after' the opening of the new store. Each wave consisted of: a seven-day food consumption diary/check list - the respondent completed this but interviewer placed and collected it; a wide-ranging, interviewer-administered household questionnaire. The diary and questionnaire were completed, as in the National Food Survey, by the person primarily responsible for the domestic food arrangements of the household. The survey fieldwork was contracted to and completed by Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS). The survey was designed by the Southampton research team with technical advice from TNS and specialists at the team's industrial partner (J. Sainsbury plc). Survey instruments and methods were piloted in February 2000, and subsequently modified and refined. Targets of 1000 respondents in Wave 1 and 600 in Wave 2 were set, in an attempt to ensure sufficient statistical power for the assessment of dietary change across the survey waves. Intense efforts were made by the research team to minimize sample attrition between waves of survey and hence reduce attrition bias problems in the subsequent analysis; monetary incentives (in the form of non-food retail shopping vouchers) were structured to maximise recruitment in Wave 1 of the survey, and sustain retention of respondents into Wave 2. Main Topics : The data files include data from the food diary and the household questionnaire. Topics covered in the questionnaire include household composition, welfare benefits and income, education and work status, disabilities and long-term health problems, smoking habits, attitudes to healthy eating, food store choice, mode of travel to <b>store,</b> <b>car</b> ownership and access, and perceived constraints on choice of foods bought. <br...|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, Southern Pacific (SP) was rarely using the westside line, {{now known as}} the St. Joseph Branch, from Saint Joseph north to Seghers, because traffic was mostly serving the Stimson Lumber Company sawmill and a few grain silos in and around Carlton. By 1980, SP was only <b>storing</b> <b>cars</b> on the line south of the {{junction}} to the sawmill, and by 1985, it had abandoned and torn up a long section of track from the mill junction to just north of Carlton. The tracks north out of Saint Joseph extended almost five miles and ended about a mile north of Carlton in order to serve the remaining Carlton customers. By the early 1990s, the line was cut back to about 1.5 miles and today, this portion is used by the Portland and Western Railroad (PNWR) exclusively to <b>store</b> <b>cars.</b> The Southern Pacific lines were leased by the Portland and Western in the early 1990s and PNWR continues to run trains from Newberg through Saint Joseph to Corvallis.|$|R
