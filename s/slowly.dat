5|$|Even though alpha {{radiation}} cannot penetrate the skin, ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs. Alpha particles generated by inhaled plutonium {{have been found}} to cause lung cancer in a cohort of European nuclear workers. The skeleton, where plutonium accumulates, and the liver, where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk. Plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion. Plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very <b>slowly,</b> with a biological half-life of 200 years. Plutonium passes only <b>slowly</b> through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries, so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very <b>slowly.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the outset, the cyclone's {{motion was}} altered by Hurricane Flossie off the Pacific coast of Mexico. Initially, deep {{convection}} fired up gradually as the depression <b>slowly</b> tracked westward in the Gulf of Mexico. At 1200UTC on August10, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle, {{as the storm}} curved southward. Gabrielle then strengthened <b>slowly</b> over the warm sea surface temperatures in a low wind shear environment, although land interaction slowed the intensification somewhat. The storm shifted once again onto a west-northwest course on August11, moving very <b>slowly</b> towards the coast.|$|E
5|$|Lophocytes are amoeba-like {{cells that}} move <b>slowly</b> through the mesohyl and secrete {{collagen}} fibres.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{technetium}} <b>slowly</b> tarnishes in {{moist air}} and, in powder form, burns in oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The 'April Cross' {{is a giant}} white radish hybrid that bolts very <b>slowly.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film's {{popularity}} <b>slowly</b> grew {{with local}} television broadcasts throughout the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The news {{filtered}} out <b>slowly</b> – first {{the players were}} told, then the media.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium is a soft, {{malleable}} and ductile {{chemical element}} that displays a bright silvery luster when pure. It {{is a rare}} earth element, and it is readily dissolved by the strong mineral acids. It reacts <b>slowly</b> with cold water and it oxidizes <b>slowly</b> in air.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium metal tarnishes <b>slowly</b> in air. Finely {{dispersed}} ytterbium readily oxidizes in air {{and under}} oxygen. Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with polytetrafluoroethylene or hexachloroethane burn with a luminous emerald-green flame. Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non-stoichiometric hydrides. Ytterbium dissolves <b>slowly</b> in water, but quickly in acids, liberating hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|A {{small group}} of wild red-billed chough arrived {{naturally}} in Cornwall in 2001, and nested in the following year. This was the first English breeding record since 1947, and a <b>slowly</b> expanding population has bred every subsequent year.|$|E
5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more <b>slowly</b> there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more <b>slowly</b> during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E
5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and <b>slowly</b> cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating <b>slowly</b> past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{importance}} of these discoveries <b>slowly</b> gained acceptance during the early twentieth century, the intricate relationships between phagocytes and all the other components of the immune system were not known until the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|April 18–21, 2003 – Subtropical Storm Ana {{develops}} west of Bermuda before <b>slowly</b> looping {{around to}} the south as a fully tropical cyclone. The island experiences gusty winds and heavy showers.|$|E
5|$|As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit {{energy in}} the form of gamma rays. These photons {{interact}} with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a <b>slowly</b> but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 , fusion occurs in a <b>slowly</b> expanding shell around the degenerate helium core.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{advancing}} science, several experiments observing {{the reaction of}} frogs to <b>slowly</b> heated water {{took place in the}} 19th century. In 1869, while doing experiments searching for the location of the soul, German physiologist Friedrich Goltz demonstrated that a frog that has had its brain removed will remain in <b>slowly</b> heated water, but an intact frog attempted to escape the water when it reached 25°C.|$|E
5|$|Atomic clocks {{also show}} that Earth's day lengthens by about 15microseconds every year, <b>slowly</b> {{increasing}} {{the rate at which}} UTC is adjusted by leap seconds.|$|E
5|$|Dyer <b>slowly</b> {{slipped into}} obscurity, and his {{dealings}} after London, including his {{place and date}} of death, are unknown.|$|E
5|$|From {{the surface}} of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear {{different}} from that of the Moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit – where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation – rises as expected in the east but <b>slowly.</b> Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as it <b>slowly</b> falls behind the rotation of Mars.|$|E
5|$|Howell Road {{was never}} given access from Route 33 {{eastbound}} {{and thus the}} ramp still remains barricaded off, <b>slowly</b> decaying.|$|E
5|$|Hydras {{and some}} sea anemones can move <b>slowly</b> over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means: {{creeping}} like snails, crawling like inchworms, or by somersaulting. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.|$|E
5|$|In Mitch Hawker's {{worldwide}} Best Roller Coaster Poll, Afterburn entered {{at position}} 12 in 1999, before <b>slowly</b> declining {{to a low}} of 41 in 2012. The ride's ranking in subsequent polls is shown in the table below.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{interpolation}} {{search is}} slower than binary search for small arrays, as interpolation search requires extra computation. Although its time complexity grows more <b>slowly</b> than binary search, this only compensates {{for the extra}} computation for large arrays.|$|E
5|$|In the mid- {{and late}} 1950s, {{the attitudes and}} {{institutions}} of McCarthyism <b>slowly</b> weakened. Changing public sentiments heavily contributed to the decline of McCarthyism. Its decline may also be charted {{through a series of}} court decisions.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was <b>slowly</b> braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused {{the expansion of the}} universe to <b>slowly</b> begin to accelerate.|$|E
5|$|John <b>slowly</b> {{disappeared}} from the public eye and no official portraits of him were commissioned after 1913.|$|E
5|$|July 23, 1985- Tropical Storm Bob makes {{landfall}} near Fort Myers, {{and while}} <b>slowly</b> {{moving across the}} state it drops heavy rainfall peaking at 21.5inches (546.1mm) in Everglades City. Despite the rainfall, damage is minimal.|$|E
5|$|June 25, 2009: Twitter ran <b>slowly</b> {{for some}} time after over 50,000 tweets on Michael Jackson's death were {{recorded}} in an hour.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is removed}} from the body very <b>slowly,</b> mainly through urine. Smaller amounts of lead are also {{eliminated}} through the feces, and very small amounts in hair, nails, and sweat.|$|E
5|$|Lipizzan horses tend {{to mature}} <b>slowly.</b> However, {{they live and}} are active longer than many other breeds, with horses {{performing}} the difficult exercises of the Spanish Riding School well into their 20s and living into their 30s.|$|E
5|$|Neon is monatomic, {{making it}} {{lighter than the}} {{molecules}} of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen which form the bulk of Earth's atmosphere; a balloon filled with neon will rise in air, albeit more <b>slowly</b> than a helium balloon.|$|E
5|$|November 15, 1981- A {{subtropical}} storm <b>slowly</b> {{moves through}} the western Atlantic, causing higher than normal tides along the Delaware coastline.|$|E
5|$|October 1–2, 2002 – As Tropical Storm Kyle <b>slowly</b> {{passes to}} the south, its outer bands drop half of Bermuda's monthly {{precipitation}} total for October.|$|E
5|$|On September28, {{a system}} {{developed}} into a tropical depression, simultaneously with Tropical Storm Monica.. It headed generally westward and on September29, 18 hours after Monica did it, strengthened into a tropical storm. Nanette continued out to sea and <b>slowly</b> strengthened. It peaked in windspeed of 50mph (85km/h) on October3 {{and turned to the}} southwest. It then <b>slowly</b> weakened. On October4, it weakened into a tropical depression and then degenerated into a disturbance that same day. No damage or deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|One {{strategy}} is to minimise actual motion, as when predators such as tigers stalk prey by moving very <b>slowly</b> and stealthily. This strategy effectively avoids the need to camouflage motion.|$|E
5|$|Recreational Road 255 {{begins at}} its western {{terminus}} at an intersection with U.S. Route 69 as a two-lane, paved road. The highway proceeds eastward through mainly rural areas, passing several small farms. The roadway continues, intersecting County Route 3251 (CR 3251) and turning northeast. The road proceeds northeast before <b>slowly</b> bending east again and continuing. It proceeds {{through the small}} community of Oak Grove and turns northeasterly. RE 255 continues, passing several homes and the small Gregory Cemetery as well as intersecting several county roads and <b>slowly</b> bending east. The route continues easterly, passing through a large forest and intersecting CR 3725 before crossing the Neches River and exiting Tyler County.|$|E
