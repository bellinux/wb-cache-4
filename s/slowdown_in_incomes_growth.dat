40|$|La volonté de posséder son « chez soi » et de se constituer un {{patrimoine}} est largement généralisée en Europe. La baisse des taux d’intérêt au cours des années 2000 et la concurrence accrue entre établissements bancaires ont favorisé la distribution du crédit, avant que la crise financière de 2007 ne remette en question ces évolutions. Malgré des mesures publiques de soutien au secteur immobilier, la chute du crédit (dans un contexte d’assainissement du bilan des banques et de ralentissement de {{la croissance}} du revenu des ménages) s’est accompagnée, après une décennie de boom immobilier, d’une baisse des prix immobiliers dans de nombreux pays européens. L’exception notable étant l’Allemagne où après dix ans de baisse, les prix se sont stabilisés au milieu des années 2000 et remontent même depuis 2010. Face à ces évolutions, nous observons ici dans quelle mesure d’une part la mobilité des ménages a évolué et d’autre part comment le contexte macroéconomique a modifié le profil des ménages qui achètent. Changes in Owner Households’ Characteristics during the Crisis in Europe The desire to own one’s {{home and to}} accumulate housing wealth is largely widespread in Europe. The fall in interest rates during the 2000 s and the increased competition between banks have promoted the distribution of credit before the financial crisis. Despite public measures to support the housing sector, house prices and credit have collapsed in many European countries, {{after a decade of}} real estate boom. These evolutions result from the strengthening of bank balance sheets and from the <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> household <b>income</b> <b>growth.</b> Germany is an exception. After ten years of decline, prices have stabilized in the mid- 2000 s and even increased since 2010. In this context, we will first focus on the trend in household mobility and then analyse how the macroeconomic environment has impacted the profile of households who have recently purchased their home. Our logit regressions show that younger and/or lower income households have been the first victims of tighter credit conditions. Indeed, in all the countries studied (Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom), low-income households have seen their probability of purchase greatly reduced. This is the case even in Germany, where the probability of purchase for other households has tended to stagnate or to grow. The purchase likelihood of households under 30 years has strongly decreased in Spain. On the contrary, the probability of young households to buy their home in France has remained constant, due to quite favourable credit conditions, the “zero interest loan” reform and increased donations...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} about the sources of <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>income</b> <b>in</b> Australia {{and the effects of}} {{structural}} change on the distribution of income between labour and capital. The main objective is to find an explanation for the fall in the labour share of <b>income</b> <b>in</b> Australia in the 2000 s. Key points 	The labour share of income fell by 4 or more percentage points in the 2000 s. 	However, labour was no worse off in the process. 	 		Labour income grew at a faster rate in the 2000 s than in the 1990 s through stronger growth in both wages and employment. 	 	 	The labour income share only fell because capital <b>income</b> <b>growth</b> accelerated even more. 	The rise in the terms of trade meant that product prices rose faster than consumer prices. While labour received a smaller share of income at product prices, the slower growth in consumer prices meant that the real value of each dollar earned was worth more in terms of its purchasing power. This purchasing power effect (which was available to all income earners) more than outweighed the apparent reduction in labour 2 ̆ 7 s share of national income. 	The large rise in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s terms of trade brought strong <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> real <b>income</b> —even stronger than the growth in the 2 ̆ 7 productivity decade 2 ̆ 7 of the 1990 s. 	 		This provided scope for growth in both labour and capital income to rise. 	 	 	Other high-income countries also experienced a decline <b>in</b> the labour <b>income</b> share, but driven by a different set of factors. In other countries, <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> labour <b>income</b> has suffered. 	The mining boom was overwhelmingly responsible for the fall in labour share in Australia: 	 		Development of mining and associated capacity added to the economy 2 ̆ 7 s capital stock, leading to more capital-intensive production overall. 		Higher output prices for minerals (and construction) reduced the real cost of labour so that growth in real wages fell behind labour productivity growth. 	 	 	The two other industries most affected by the mining boom — Construction and Manufacturing — served to increase the labour <b>income</b> share. 	 		<b>In</b> Manufacturing, a <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> capital <b>income</b> <b>growth</b> meant the industry contributed more to labour income than to capital income at the aggregate level. 		Construction had stronger <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> capital <b>income</b> than <b>in</b> labour <b>income.</b> However, because the industry is labour intensive, growth in Construction 2 ̆ 7 s labour income had a greater effect on aggregate labour <b>income</b> than <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> its capital <b>income</b> had on aggregate capital income. 	 	 	As the terms of trade now decline, the labour income share will rise. But with a more capital-intensive economy, the share is unlikely to revert fully to previous levels. 	Action to restore the old labour income share or to recover 2 ̆ 7 lost 2 ̆ 7 income share through wage rises would probably only have adverse consequences for employment and inflation and for industries already facing adjustment pressures. 	With the prospect of declining terms of trade, a focus on productivity growth will be the way to sustain growth in real wages...|$|R
