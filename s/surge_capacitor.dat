40|$|The {{electric}} transients generated {{during the}} switching of a breaker placed near the transformer {{in a system}} with {{a substantial amount of}} cables can have a very short rise time and can reach very high magnitudes. In practice, the magnitude of the voltage surges is usually limited using the surge arresters while the rise time of the surge to which the apparatus is exposed, remains unchanged. In this paper, the characteristic of the switching transients generated in the MV cable grids are analyzed. For this purpose, cases with both dry-type and oil insulated transformers are studied. These cases are typical for a MV industrial grid and a wind park (WP) collection grid. Furthermore, the case with and without surge arrester protection is analyzed in order to observe the impact of the surge arresters on the voltage surges. Simulations show that the magnitude of the voltage surges exceeds the basic lightning impulse insulation level (BIL) defined by present standards. Furthermore, the rise time of the voltage surges is much shorter compared to the rise time of the lightning impulse {{especially in the case of}} the dry-type transformers and the WP collection grid. When surge arresters are used, the magnitude of the surges is limited to the BIL but the rise times of the surges can be twenty five times shorter compared to the BIL. Only when surge arresters are used with other fast transient mitigation equipment such as RC protection or <b>surge</b> <b>capacitor</b> protection, the magnitude of very fast voltage surges are brought down...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a {{study of}} high {{frequency}} electromagnetic transient phenomena is performed. Models of various components needed for simulations of high frequency transients, such as for transformers, cables and breakers are developed. Measurements were performed in Chalmers research laboratory {{as well as at}} ABB Corporate Research in Västerås, Sweden for the purpose of parameter estimation of models and for verification of simulations. Critical cases where the voltage surges of the magnitude and/or rise time above basic lightning impulse voltage level appear, are identified. Also, some transient protection schemes are analyzed and the performance of different transient mitigation devices is studied. Furthermore, the voltage distribution along the winding during very fast transients is studied in order to estimate turn-to-turn voltages and the critical voltage envelope. In the work it was found that simulations of the high frequency transients are in a very good agreement with the measurements obtained in the laboratory. Simulations predicted accurately critical surges with the highest magnitude and matched with good accuracy surge waveforms recorded during the measurements. The accuracy of the rise times is within 10 %, while the magnitudes during the critical cases are within a 5 % margin. During the testing and simulations, surges which exceed the basic lightning impulse voltage level of dry-type transformers specified by IEEE standards, both in magnitude and rise time are observed at the transformers even when surge arresters are used to protect the transformers. Furthermore, obtained voltage surges exceeded the proposed critical voltage envelope. It is shown that the most critical voltage strikes are obtained with dry-type transformers, where the rise time is five to ten times shorter compared to oil-insulated transformer with the same rating. It was confirmed both in simulations and measurements that the use of additional transient protections devices such as <b>surge</b> <b>capacitors</b> and RC protections, decreased the magnitude of surges to be below the critical level. The analysis of the voltage during very fast transients showed that the rise time of the transients directly influences the magnitude of the turn-to-turn voltages. Furthermore, during the breaker closing transient, turn-to-turn voltages, measured in delta connected dry-type transformers, were 2. 5 times higher than the voltages obtained during the same transient with a wye connected dry-type transformer, or during the stress with a 4. 4 p. u. lightning impulse voltage...|$|R

50|$|Isolated-phase bus {{is made in}} {{ratings from}} 3000 amperes to 45,000 amperes, and rated for {{voltages}} from 5000 volts up to about 35,000 volts. In the larger current ratings, dry air is forced through the enclosures and within the tubular conductors for forced-air cooling of the conductors. The cooling air is recirculated through a heat exchanger. Some items of switchgear, such as circuit breakers and isolating switches, are made in housings compatible with the isolated-phase bus. Accessories such as instrument transformers, <b>surge</b> arresters, and <b>capacitors</b> are also made in compatible housings. Due to the expense of its construction and the energy loss, isolated-phase bus is usually used in short segments; a large underground powerhouse may have isolated-phase bus up to about 250 metres or so to connect generators to transformers in an underground cavern.|$|R
40|$|Power-on failure {{has been}} the {{prevalent}} failure mechanism for solid tantalum capacitors in decoupling applications. A surge step stress test (SSST) has been previously applied to identify the critical stress level of a capacitor batch to give some predictability to the power-on failure mechanism [1]. But SSST can also {{be viewed as an}} electrically destructive test under a time-varying stress (voltage). It consists of rapidly charging the capacitor with incremental voltage increases, through a low resistance in series, until the capacitor under test is electrically shorted. When the reliability of capacitors is evaluated, a highly accelerated life test (HALT) is usually adopted since it is a time-efficient method of determining the failure mechanism; however, a destructive test under a time-varying stress such as SSST is even more time efficient. It usually takes days or weeks to complete a HALT test, but it only takes minutes for a time-varying stress test to produce failures. The advantage of incorporating a specific time-varying stress profile into a statistical model is significant in providing an alternative life test method for quickly revealing the failure mechanism in capacitors. In this paper, a time-varying stress that mimics a typical SSST has been incorporated into the Weibull model to characterize the failure mechanism in different types of capacitors. The SSST circuit and transient conditions for correctly <b>surge</b> testing <b>capacitors</b> are discussed. Finally, the SSST was applied for testing Ta capacitors, polymer aluminum capacitors (PA capacitors), and multi-layer ceramic (MLC) capacitors with both precious metal electrodes (PME) and base metal electrodes (BME). The test results are found to be directly associated with the dielectric layer breakdown in Ta and PA capacitors and are independent of the capacitor values, the way the capacitors were built, and the capacitors manufacturers. The test results also show that MLC <b>capacitors</b> exhibit <b>surge</b> breakdown voltages much higher than the rated voltage and that the breakdown field is inversely proportional to the dielectric layer thickness. The SSST data {{can also be used to}} comparatively evaluate the voltage robustness of capacitors for decoupling applications...|$|R
