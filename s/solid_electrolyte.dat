25|$|Although {{the present}} article only refers in essence to {{aluminum}} electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, {{an overview of the}} different types of aluminum electrolytic capacitors is given here in order to highlight the differences. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors are divided into two sub-types depending on whether they make use of liquid or <b>solid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> systems.

25|$|Like other {{conventional}} capacitors, {{electrolytic capacitors}} store the electric energy statically by charge separation in an electric {{field in the}} dielectric oxide layer between two electrodes. The non-solid or <b>solid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> in principle is the cathode, which thus forms the second electrode of the capacitor. This and the storage principle distinguish them from electrochemical capacitors or supercapacitors, in which the electrolyte generally is the ionic conductive connection between two electrodes and the storage occurs with statically double-layer capacitance and electrochemical pseudocapacitance.|$|E
25|$|The {{published}} {{figures show}} that both capacitor types, tantalum and aluminum, are reliable components, comparable with other electronic components and achieving safe operation for decades under normal conditions. But a great difference exists {{in the case of}} wear-out failures. Tantalum capacitors with <b>solid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> have no wear-out mechanism so that the constant failure rate is least, up to the point when all capacitors fail. Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, however, have a limited time of constant random failures up to that point when the wear-out failures start. This time of the constant random failure rate corresponds with the lifetime or service life of “wet” aluminum electrolytic capacitors.|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{effort to}} develop all-solid-state lithium ion {{batteries}} containing various <b>solid</b> <b>electrolytes</b> is under way to replace conventional lithium ion batteries containing combustible liquid electrolytes due to the safety issues. These efforts are becoming increasingly important with the increasing size of batteries for use in electric vehicle (EV). Despite a high safety of all-solid state batteries, their commercialization is faced with a difficulty due to the poor cycle performance and high-rate capability. One reason for these inferior performances of all-solid-state batteries is low ionic conductivities of <b>solid</b> <b>electrolytes</b> compared with liquid electrolytes.

40|$|Ion {{conducting}} solids are {{the materials}} which exhibit high ionic conductivity, typically {{in the range}} of ~ 10 - 5 - 10 - 1 S cm- 1, and negligible electronic conductivity [1]. These solids are also known as <b>solid</b> <b>electrolytes,</b> or fast ion conductors. The development of <b>solid</b> <b>electrolytes</b> has been driven by their tremendous technological applications in the areas of energy storage, energy conversion and in the field of environment monitoring. These materials are used as electrolytes and electrode separators in various electrochemical devices like, fuel cells, batteries, super capacitors, sensors, etc. By virtue of being a <b>solid,</b> <b>solid</b> <b>electrolytes</b> possess numerous advantages over liquid electrolytes like, absence of liquid containment and leakage problem, ability to operate with highly reactive electrodes over a wide range of temperature, and the possibility of miniaturization [2].

25|$|The {{relevant}} {{development of}} <b>solid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> tantalum capacitors began some years after William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain invented the transistor in 1947.

Taylor and H. E. Haring of the Bell labs in early 1950 was based on experiences with ceramics. They ground tantalum to a powder, which they pressed into a cylindrical form and then sintered at high a temperature between 1500 and 2000°C under vacuum conditions to produce a pellet ("slug").|$|E
25|$|Details of the {{fabrication}} and resulting microstructure {{of the glass}} membrane of the pH electrode are maintained as trade secrets by the manufacturers. However, certain aspects of design are published. Glass is a <b>solid</b> <b>electrolyte,</b> for which alkali-metal ions can carry current. The pH-sensitive glass membrane is generally spherical to simplify manufacture of a uniform membrane. These membranes are up to 0.4 millimeters in thickness, thicker than original designs, so as to render the probes durable. The glass has silicate chemical functionality on its surface, which provides binding sites for alkali-metal ions and hydrogen ions from the solutions. This provides an ion-exchange capacity {{in the range of}} 10−6 to 10−8mol/cm2. Selectivity for hydrogen ions (H+) arises from a balance of ionic charge, volume requirements versus other ions, and the coordination number of other ions. Electrode manufacturers have developed compositions that suitably balance these factors, most notably lithium glass.|$|E

Batteries are suitable for power storage because of their high energy efficiencies. Lithium ion batteries with high energy densities are expected to be used in large-scale power storage systems.
