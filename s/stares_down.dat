5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Danielle Federici, was filmed {{during the early}} summer of 1994. It was filmed in black-and-white, and features Carey walking along the streets of New York, watching several different people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, lonely {{and in need of}} a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with straightened hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long straightened hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking down a long New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's face. As she <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir dressed in black singing perched atop a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who is sitting on a withered stoop.|$|E
25|$|For Neff's {{office at}} Pacific All Risk, Wilder and set {{designer}} Hal Pereira conspired {{to create a}} little in-house joke, typical of Billy Wilder. In the opening scenes, as Walter Neff stumbles off the elevator {{on his way to}} his office to record his confession, the vast two-tiered office is empty and dark. With the camera following him, Neff lurches towards the balcony railing overlooking rows and rows of uniform corporate desks. Neff turns left, but the camera continues forward until it reaches the brink and <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> for an anxious moment into a colorless American business purgatory. Here, Pereira is said to have copied an existing office: the corporate headquarters of Paramount Pictures in New York City.|$|E

6000|$|CARMODY (pleased). Ah, don't be talkin'! She'll {{know more}} than the lot of us before she's grown even. (He pauses in his walk and <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> at Eileen, frowning.) Are you sick, Eileen, that you're keepin' your eyes shut without a word out of you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish to God she {{had never}} set them on the captain, {{whatever}} colour they are," [...] retorted Franklin.

Perhaps you will tell us that his eyes are not yellow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was such}} a morning as often follows a gale, when the great {{firmament}} <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> upon the ruin which it has made, bright and clear, and bold; and seems to say, with shameless smile,--"There, I have done it; and am as merry as ever after it all!" [...] Beneath a cloudless sky, the breakers, still grey and foul from the tempest, were tumbling in before a cold northern breeze. Half a mile out at sea, the rough backs of the Chough and Crow loomed black and sulky in the foam. At their feet, the rocks and shingle of the Cove were alive with human beings--groups {{of women and children}} clustering round a corpse or a chest; sailors, knee-deep in the surf hauling at floating spars and ropes; oil-skinned coast-guardsmen pacing up and down in charge of goods, while groups of farmers' men, who had hurried down from the villages inland, lounged about {{on the top of the}} cliff, looking sulkily on, hoping for plunder: and yet half afraid to mingle with the sailors below, who looked on them as an inferior race, and refused, in general, to intermarry with them.|$|E

5000|$|Wachter often {{stands in}} a [...] "pigeon-toed" [...] stance (both feet turned in toward each other) when he plays his bass, and <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> at his feet. He says doing this allows him {{to focus on what}} he's playing and keeps him from being distracted by fans.|$|E

50|$|As in Donatello's sculpture, the condottiero <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> the onlooker, to {{emphasize}} his power, command and determination in battle. The elegant hat and the flittering cloak area {{examples of the}} increasing taste for fine decorative elements in Florentine art, {{in contrast with the}} more austere, fresco of John Hawkwood by Uccello completed some 30 years earlier.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Based on 17 reviews, it holds a 71% [...] "Fresh" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Jeanette Causulis from the New York Times {{said in her}} review that [...] "Deftly combining low-key romance and gentle humor, the director, Ella Lemhagen (working from Michael Druker's 2008 play), <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> prejudice with a nudge and a wink rather than a soapbox." ...|$|E
5000|$|The film {{is notable}} for the catchphrase, [...] "Go ahead, make my day", which is uttered by Clint Eastwood's gun-wielding {{character}} {{in the beginning of}} the film as he <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> an armed robber who is holding a hostage. That phrase, although in its Italian localization [...] "Coraggio... fatti ammazzare" [...] ("come on, let me kill you"), was also chosen as the title for the Italian version of the film.|$|E

5000|$|The {{sequence}} {{revolves around}} a man {{sent to a}} prison camp in the Midwestern United States, where he is instructed to train wild mustangs. A prisoner <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> one of the mustangs before opening the gate to release him. The prisoner is charged with retrieving the horse, and the piece ends with the man riding the horse across the plains, over the strapline [...] "a story of darkness and light".|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing the series, Jeff Silverman {{wrote in}} Variety: [...] "Twenty years after Richard Nixon {{resigned}} {{the presidency in}} disgrace, this stunningly conceived and realized documentary miniseries brilliantly chronicles the events — and their inevitability — {{that led to the}} national nightmare Watergate. Funny, tragic, pathetic and probing, docu dramatically <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> Watergate’s smoking gun and makes its ultimate conclusion perfectly clear: Nixon’s the one. Still. Now more than ever." ...|$|E

Obould lowers his weapon and seemingly agrees to a parlay with Mithral Hall and the North. Hralien allows Tos'un {{to live in the}} Moonwood and the group returns home.|$|E
