50|$|The {{electronics}} of Garcia's Irwin guitars are unique, {{and feature}} an onboard preamp and effects loop. Much like a Stratocaster, the three pickups are selected with a five-way <b>switch.</b> <b>Signal</b> from the pickups {{passes through the}} tone controls, followed by an op-amp based buffer preamp, or Unity Gain Buffer, {{which is designed to}} prevent signal loss due to capacitance when long cables are used. From the preamp, the signal could be routed via a mini-toggle on the guitar's face to pass through a Y-cable to Garcia's effects rack, and then back into the guitar. This onboard effects loop serves to send the full output of Tiger's pickups to the effects while allowing the guitar's volume control to vary the final output. The effects loop could be bypassed by the aforementioned switch, sending the guitar's signal from the preamp to the volume control, and then out to Garcia's preamped (and heavily modified) Fender Twin Reverb into a McIntosh MC2300 solid state power amplifier. Tiger started with DiMarzio Dual Sound humbuckers in the middle and bridge positions with a DiMarzio SDs-1 single coil at the neck. The humbuckers were switched to Dimarzio Super II's in 1982. Each of the humbuckers is equipped with a coil cut switch. In summary, there is one 5 way pickup selector, one master volume control, one tone control which affects the neck and bridge pickups, and one which affects the middle pickup as well as three mini toggles, two for the coil-cut of the bridge and middle pickups respectively and one for the on-board effects loop on/off.|$|E

40|$|SummaryHow the {{sequential}} {{specification of}} neurons and progressive loss of potency associated with aging neural progenitors are regulated in vertebrate brain development is poorly understood. By examining a temporal differentiation lineage in the hindbrain, we here identify Tgfβ as a <b>switch</b> <b>signal</b> that executes the transition between {{early and late}} phases of neurogenesis and concurrently constrains progenitor potency. Young progenitors have inherent competence to produce late-born neurons, but implementation of late-differentiation programs requires suppression of early identity genes achieved through temporally programmed activation of Tgfβ downstream of Shh signaling. Unexpectedly, we find that sequentially occurring fate-switch decisions are temporally coupled, and onset of Tgfβ signaling appears thereby to impact on the overall lifespan of the temporal lineage. Our study establishes Tgfβ as a regulator of temporal identity and potency of neural stem cells, and provides proof of concept that Tgfβ {{can be applied to}} modulate temporal specification of neurons in stem cell engineering...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{transition}} of guanine nucleotide binding proteins between the ‘on’ (GTP-bound) and ‘off’ (GDP-bound) states {{has become a}} paradigm of molecular switching after a chemical reaction. The mechanism by which the <b>switch</b> <b>signal</b> is transmitted to the downstream recipients in the intracellular signal pathway has been extensively studied by biochemical, biophysical and genetic methods, but {{a clear picture of}} this process has yet to emerge.

The model provides important clues about: (1) a possible molecular mechanism for signal transmission from the site of GTP hydrolysis to downstream effectors; (2) a major conformational change during signal generation and a key residue involved in this process (Tyr- 64); and (3) regions in ras-p 21 that can be differentially recognized by binding to external partners in a GTP/GDP state dependent fashion, most notably residues D 69, Q 70, R 73, T 74, R 102, K 104, D 105 {{at the end of the}} α-helices 2 and 3...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 1 Several {{methods of}} {{chattering}} reduction have been reported. One approach [5] places a boundary layer around the switching surface {{such that the}} relay control {{is replaced by a}} saturation function. Another method [6] replaces a max-min-type control by a unit vector function. These approaches involve a trade-off between chattering and robustness. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a Fuzzy sliding mode controller (FSMC) with a nonlinear sliding surface for a coupled Tanks system. In the present work, a first-order nonlinear sliding surface is presented, on which the developed control law is based. Mathematical proof for the stability and convergence of the system is presented. In order to reduce the chattering in sliding mode controller (SMC), a fixed boundary layer around the switch surface is used. Within the boundary layer, since the fuzzy logic control is applied, the chattering phenomenon, which is inherent in a sliding mode control, is avoided by smoothing the <b>switch</b> <b>signal.</b> Outside the boundary, the sliding mode control is applied to driving the system states into the boundary layer. Experimental studies carried out on a coupled Tanks system indicate that the proposed approach is a good candidate for control applications...|$|E

The data reported herein show that, when cells of Monoraphidium braunii at pH 8, containing both active nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase, were sparged with CO 2 -free air and irradiated with strong background red light, they took up oxidized nitrogen sources only when PAR comprised blue light. The activation of the transport system(s) of either both nitrate and nitrite was very quick and elicited by low irradiance blue light.

The requirement of blue light for nitrate uptake was independent of the availability of CO 2 to cells. However, cells under high CO 2 tensions, although they showed an absolute blue light requirement to initially establish the uptake of nitrite, as they gained carbon skeletons to allocate ammonia, gradually increased their nitrite uptake rates in the subsequent red light intervals.

40|$|Abstract. The {{essential}} {{dynamics of}} some biological central pattern generators (CPGs) can {{be captured by}} a model consisting of N neurons connected in a ring. These circuits, like many oscillatory nonlinear circuits of sucient complexity, are capable of multistability, that is, of generating dierent firing patterns distin-guished by the phasic relationships between the firing in each circuit element (neuron). Moreover, a shift in firing pattern can be induced by a transient perturba-tion. A systematic approach, based on phase-response curve (PRC) theory, {{was used to determine}} the optimum timing for perturbations that induce a shift in the firing pattern. The first step was to visualize the solution space of the ring circuit, including the attrac-tive basins for each stable firing pattern; this was possible using the relative phase of N ÿ 1 oscillators, with respect to an arbitrarily selected reference oscilla-tor, as coordinate axes. The trajectories in this phase space were determined using an iterative mapping based only on the PRCs of the uncoupled component oscillators; this algorithm was called a circuit emulator. For an accurate mapping of the attractive basin of each pattern exhibited by the ring circuit, the emulator had {{to take into account the}} eect of a perturbation or input on the timing of two bursts following the onset of the perturbation, rather than just one. The visualiza-tion of the attractive basins for rings of two, three, and four oscillators enabled the accurate prediction of the amounts of phase resetting applied to up to N ÿ 1 oscillators within a cycle that would induce a transition from any pattern to any another pattern. Finally, the timing and synaptic characterization of an input called the <b>switch</b> <b>signal</b> was adjusted to produce the desired amount of phase resetting. ...|$|E
