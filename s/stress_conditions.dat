5|$|Restrictive N-terminal truncation: The {{approximately}} 30 {{amino acids}} N-terminal extension of cTnI is an adult heart-specific structure. The N-terminal extension contains the PKA phosphorylation sites Ser23/Ser24 and {{plays a role}} in modulating the overall molecular conformation and function of cTnI. A restrictive N-terminal truncation of cTnI occurs at low levels in normal hearts of all vertebrate species examined including human and significantly increases in adaptation to hemodynamic stress and Gsα deficiency-caused failing mouse hearts. Distinct from the harmful C-terminal truncation, the restrictive N-terminal truncation of cTnI selectively removing the adult heart specific extension forms a regulatory mechanism in cardiac adaptation to physiological and pathological <b>stress</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Marasmius rotula is a {{saprobic}} {{species and}} as such obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter. It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in groups or clusters on dead wood (especially beech), woody debris such as twigs or sticks, and occasionally on rotting leaves. The fruit bodies, which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size, are often present in abundance after rains. The species is relatively intolerant of low water potentials, and will grow poorly {{or not at all}} under water <b>stress</b> <b>conditions.</b> It is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more compacted so that the water-holding capacity increases in the deeper layers of the soil. The magnolia warbler has been noted to line its nests with the fruit bodies' stems.|$|E
5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being {{the key to success}} in an area where water stress is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include drip irrigation, the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to <b>stress</b> <b>conditions</b> and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions. A field trial in the Sonoran Desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.|$|E

25|$|The enzyme is {{also thought}} {{to act as}} a safety valve for <b>stress</b> <b>conditions</b> in the {{photosynthetic}} apparatus. By providing an electron sink when the plastoquinone pool is over-reduced, the oxidase is thought to protect photosystem II from oxidative damage. Knockouts for Rubisco and photosystem II complexes, which would experience more photodamage than normal, exhibit an upregulation of plastid terminal oxidase. This effect is not universal because it requires plants to have additional PTOX regulation mechanisms. While many studies agree with the stress-protective role of the enzyme, one study showed that overexpression of PTOX increases the production of reactive oxygen species and causes more photodamage than normal. This finding suggests that an efficient antioxidant system is required for the oxidase to function as a safety valve for <b>stress</b> <b>conditions</b> and that it is more important during chloroplast biogenesis than in the regular functioning of the chloroplast.|$|E

Cultivars of Shiraz and Gascogen showed the highest and lowest root growth rates under normal while Azar 2 and Kavir showed the highest and lowest values under salt <b>stress</b> <b>condition.</b> Cultivars Shiraz and Azar 2 showed the highest and Kavir and Hirmand the lowest leaf growth rates under normal condition while under salt <b>stress</b> <b>condition</b> Mahdavi and Saison showed the highest and lowest values, respectively. Generally, growth rates were reduced under salt stress compared to the control condition. In another experiment, leaf samples were taken from 10 selected cultivars grown under the same <b>stress</b> <b>condition</b> and in all RWC and Na, K and Ca content were measured. Seedlings under salt <b>stress</b> <b>condition</b> had 34 % more Na, 25 % more Ca and 48 % more K/Na ratio while they had 29 % less RWC compared to the control condition. There were no significant correlations between growth rates and ion content. Meanwhile, cultivars with higher growth rates under control condition showed higher growth rates under <b>stress</b> <b>condition.</b> It was suggested that cultivars with higher growth rates under salt <b>stress</b> <b>condition</b> may be able to escape from the detrimental effects of saline top soils and produce more vigorous seedlings which may help them to have better yield performance under salt <b>stress</b> <b>condition.</b> This needs to be investigated in the future studies...|$|R

When blood flow is suppressed, glutamate is released from presynaptic neurons causing NMDA and AMPA receptor activation more so than would normally be the case outside of <b>stress</b> <b>conditions,</b> leading to elevated Ca2+ and Na+ entering the post synaptic neuron and cell damage.

25|$|GAPDH acts as {{reversible}} metabolic switch under oxidative stress. When {{cells are}} exposed to oxidants, they need excessive amounts of the antioxidant cofactor NADPH. In the cytosol, NADPH is reduced from NADP+ by several enzymes, three of them catalyze the first steps of the Pentose phosphate pathway. Oxidant-treatments cause an inactivation of GAPDH. This inactivation re-routes temporally the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, allowing the cell to generate more NADPH. Under <b>stress</b> <b>conditions,</b> NADPH is needed by some antioxidant-systems including glutaredoxin and thioredoxin {{as well as being}} essential for the recycling of gluthathione.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant hormone}} {{ethylene}} is a combatant for salinity in most plants. Ethylene {{is known for}} regulating plant growth and development and adapted to <b>stress</b> <b>conditions.</b> Central membrane proteins in plants, such as ETO2, ERS1 and EIN2, are used for ethylene signaling in many plant growth processes. ETO2, Ethylene overproducer 2, is a protein that when mutated it will gain a function to continually produce ethylene even {{when there is no}} stress condition, causing the plant to grow short and stumpy. ERS1, Ethylene response sensor 1, is activated when ethylene is present in the signaling pathway and when mutated, it loses a function and cannot bind to ethylene. This means a response is never activated and the plant {{will not be able to}} cope with the abiotic stress. EIN2, Ethylene insensitive 2, is a protein that activates the pathway and when there is a mutation here the EIN2 will block ethylene stimulation and an ethylene response gene will not be activated. Mutations in these proteins can lead to heightened salt sensitivity and limit plant growth. The effects of salinity have been studied on Arabidopsis plants that have mutated ERS1 and EIN4 proteins. These proteins are used for ethylene signaling again certain <b>stress</b> <b>conditions,</b> such as salt and the ethylene precursor ACC is allowing suppress of any sensitivity to the salt stress. Mutations in these pathways can cause lack of ethylene signaling, causing stunt in plant growth and development.|$|E

Cylindrical, step-cylindrical and truncated-conic specimens are used to generate different <b>stress</b> <b>condition</b> {{in an attempt to}} induce strain localization in the alloy. The microstructure of the specimens after tests is examined by optical microscopy and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM).

In order to analyze the <b>stress</b> <b>condition</b> of different specimen geometry, finite element simulations are also presented. The Johnson-Cook model is employed to simulate the thermo-viscoplastic response of the material.

25|$|When acclimating to {{increased}} levels of oxidative stress, SOD concentrations typically increase with the degree of <b>stress</b> <b>conditions.</b> The compartmentalization of different forms of SOD throughout the plant makes them counteract stress very effectively. There are three well-known and -studied classes of SOD metallic coenzymes that exist in plants. First, Fe SODs consist of two species, one homodimer (containing 1-2 g Fe) and one tetramer (containing 2-4 g Fe). They {{are thought to be}} the most ancient SOD metalloenzymes and are found within both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Fe SODs are most abundantly localized inside plant chloroplasts, where they are indigenous. Second, Mn SODs consist of a homodimer and homotetramer species each containing a single Mn(III) atom per subunit. They are found predominantly in mitochondrion and peroxisomes. Third, Cu-Zn SODs have electrical properties very {{different from those of the}} other two classes. These are concentrated in the chloroplast, cytosol, and in some cases the extracellular space. Note that Cu-Zn SODs provide less protection than Fe SODs when localized in the chloroplast.|$|E
