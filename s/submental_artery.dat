50|$|The <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> is {{a branch}} of the facial artery that runs on the {{underside}} of the chin.|$|E
50|$|Beneath the gland, on {{the surface}} of the Mylohyoideus, are the <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> and the mylohyoid artery and nerve.|$|E
30|$|The sublingual and <b>submental</b> <b>arteries</b> {{normally}} anastomose {{through their}} muscular mylohyoid branches [7]. Loukas et al. [6] only identified anastomotic patterns between sublingual and <b>submental</b> <b>arteries</b> in 40  % of the dissected cadavers, with no {{case where the}} two terminate as a single sublingual artery. We found three (8.9  %) cases of an anastomotic branch of the <b>submental</b> and lingual <b>artery</b> forming a single sublingual artery just before entering the MMLF.|$|R
50|$|The gland {{receives}} its {{blood supply}} from the sublingual and <b>submental</b> <b>arteries.</b> Lymph from the sublingual salivary gland drains into the submandibular lymph nodes.|$|R
5000|$|The gland {{receives}} its {{blood supply}} from the facial and lingual arteries. The gland is supplied by sublingual and <b>submental</b> <b>arteries</b> and drained by common facial and lingual veins.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> turns upward {{over the}} border of the {{mandible}} it divides into a superficial and a deep branch.|$|E
50|$|It {{contains}} {{one or two}} lymph glands, the submental {{lymph nodes}} and some small veins; the latter unite to form the anterior jugular vein <b>submental</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> is {{the largest}} of the {{cervical}} branches of the facial artery, given off just as that vessel leaves the submandibular gland: it runs forward upon the mylohyoid, just below the body of the mandible, and beneath the digastric muscle.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} of this flap {{is that there}} is no need to skin graft the donor site and scars are placed at the natural skin folds. This flap is used for posterior and moderate-sized anterior cheek defects. Lower eyelid ectropion should be prevented, by minimizing tension and by overcorrection and suspension of the cheek flap to the lateral orbital rim. This anterior-based flap is supplied by the facial and <b>submental</b> <b>arteries</b> and advances upward from the cervical area and rotates forward.|$|R
40|$|The {{vascular}} {{anatomy of}} submental flaps (SFs) represents a determining factor in successful SF raising. However, {{little attention has}} been focused on the venous return of SFs. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate SF venous return. This study enrolled patients who underwent SF reconstructive surgery in a tertiary referral center between November 2009 and October 2016. The drainage pathway of the SF venous return was routinely identified during the course of our operations to prevent damage during head and neck surgery. The venous return data of 70 patients were reviewed. The size of the flaps ranged from 15 to 84 cm 2, and total flap loss was not observed in the case series. All of the <b>submental</b> <b>arteries</b> originated from the facial artery; however, the submental veins of 70 patients returned to either the internal jugular vein (IJV, 72. 9 %) or the external jugular vein (EJV, 27. 1 %). Our data suggest that drainage of the submental vein into the EJV, which has been previously overlooked, should receive greater attention during SF surgeries. The results support mandatory preservation of the EJV and IJV and indicate that vascular anatomy is a determining factor for successful SF raising...|$|R
40|$|Along {{with the}} popularization of dental implant surgery, {{there has been}} {{considerable}} research on the lingual foramen using cone-beam computed tomography. Anatomical research has also revealed that the arteries entering the lingual foramina are branches of the <b>submental</b> and sublingual <b>arteries.</b> There have been no reports, however, of the <b>submental</b> or sublingual <b>artery</b> entering the mandible from the lingual foramen, perforating it, and then distributing to the inferior labial region. A 69 -year-old man who donated his body to our department in 2015 was dissected. The mandible with overlying soft tissue of the mental region was resected and examined with microcomputed tomography, which showed that the canal perforated from the lingual foramen to the midline of the labial cortical plate. The canal was thus named the median perforating canal. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there have been no other reports of a perforating artery of the mandible, so this case is thought to be rare. Hence, the existence of perforating arteries, such as in the present case, should be taken into consideration in preoperative diagnoses such as for dental implant surgery. Thus, the fusion of anatomical and radiological study is useful and necessary to understand surgical anatomy...|$|R
30|$|In a cadaveric {{study by}} Bavitz et al. [16], {{it was found}} that the <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> was the main {{arterial}} blood supply to the floor of the mouth (53  %). Consequently, they suggested that the <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> should be ligated first during extra-oral ligation to control haemorrhage in the floor of the mouth. Conversely, the sublingual artery appeared to originate from the <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> in less than a quarter (17.6  %) of the cadavers in the present study. Our results are similar to those of Loukas et al. [6] (27  %).|$|E
30|$|Within the {{limitations}} of this study, the sublingual artery that enters the MMLF {{was found to be}} the sublingual artery as either a branch of the lingual artery (73.5  %), the <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> (17.6  %) or an anastomosis of the lingual and submental arteries (8.9  %). We suggest that extra-oral ligation of the lingual artery should be done first followed by ligation of the <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> (or its parent facial artery) in case of continued bleeding. Studies with a larger sample of females should be conducted to confirm the findings of this study.|$|E

40|$|Facial palsy is a {{debilitating}} condition, resulting in {{weakness of the}} musculature of the face. Facial reanimation procedures around the orbit are limited. Surgical intervention is undertaken to restore facial symmetry, but does not always provide a functional improvement. Due to the similarity of platysma to the orbicularis oculi in thickness, this study proposed the hypothesis that platysma {{can be used for}} facial reanimation around the orbit. This study documented the precise pattern of neurovascular supply of platysma through dissection in embalmed cadaveric material and aimed to determine whether a pedicle could be established. The neurovasculature of platysma was found to be consistent with three main features–the nerve and arterial supply to the muscle and its venous drainage. In all four specimens examined, the arterial supply always arose from the <b>submental</b> and facial <b>artery,</b> the venous drainage was always to the external and anterior jugular veins, and the nerve supply always arose from the cervical branch of the facial nerve. It was also noted that these vessels and nerves lay in close proximity to each other. This suggests that a “window” of platysma could be taken for use in orbital facial reanimation procedures to allow function to be restored around the eye...|$|R
40|$|Background: The <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> island flap is a {{reliable}} reconstructive option for lower face defects. Advantages of this flap include suppleness of tissue, excellent {{color and texture}} match to facial skin, a wide arc of rotation, prominent blood supply, and a well-hidden donor site scar. Methods: This article describes a 61 -year-old man with eccrine carcinoma of the chin necessitating extensive excision. A <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> island flap {{was used for the}} reconstruction of the extended chin subunit. Results: The operation resulted in excellent aesthetic outcome and maintenance of oral competence. Conclusion: The <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> island flap utilizes loose tissue of the submental area to effectively and reliably reconstruct the soft tissue subunits of the chin and is a superb option for sizable defects. The flap is sufficiently well vascularized to tolerate postoperative radiation therapy without significant fibrosis or retraction. The chin is an aesthetically and functionally important anatomic subunit of the face, bordered by the lower lip superiorly and the mandible/submandibular line inferiorly. The soft tissue formation of the chin includes the vermilion component of the lip, multiple muscle layers, and the gonion with firm muscular and boney attachments. 1 − 4 Soft tissu...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background. The <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> island flap is a {{recently}} described local flap {{that may be}} used for reconstruction of the lower and middle thirds of the face and oral cavity. The reverse-flow manner of the flap has been used in limited cases because of possible drawbacks such as venous congestion. We present our experience with the use of reverse-flow <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> flap and describe the surgical technique. Methods. This versatile flap was successfully used for large periorbital soft-tissue defects and socket reconstruction in six patients in the past 2 years. The diagnosis of three patients was basal cell carcinoma of the eyelids, which required orbital exenteration, and the other patient had traumatic periorbital defects. The flap size varied from a minimum of 4 6 cm to a maximum of 6 8 cm. Results. No major complications were noted other than one case of temporary palsy of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve and one other of venous congestion, which subsided spontaneously. In all patients, the results were satis-factory, with acceptable cosmesis. Conclusions. The reverse-flow <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> island flap is safe, rapid, and simple to raise and leaves a well-hidden scar. We believe that this flap surpasses the other flaps in recon-struction of large periorbital soft-tissue defects and socket...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe mylohyoid is a triangular, sheet-like muscle that {{typically}} attaches at the mylohyoid {{line of the}} mandible, {{the body of the}} hyoid, and a median raphe, which stretches from the mandibular symphysis anteriorly to the hyoid bone posteriorly. Few cases have ever documented anatomical variation of the mylohyoid outside of the common mylohyoid boutonnière. Dissection of the suprahyoid musculature of an 88 -year-old Caucasian male revealed mylohyoid musculature that did not insert at the hyoid, but rather inserted firmly at the mid-belly of the geniohyoid musculature at a tough fibrous ‘pseudo-hyoid. ’ This case report is the first to ever document a mylohyoid inserting firmly to the geniohyoid musculature midway between the chin and hyoid. The case described herein lends support to the exclusion of musculature from the <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> flap. Inclusion of a mylohyoid, as described in this report, in the <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> flap may lead to surgical confusion and unintentional damage to the mylohyoid and geniohyoid musculature as well as surrounding structures...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Reconstruction of {{intraoral}} {{soft tissue}} defects {{is important in}} restoring function and esthetic. In large defects, there will be demand for regional pedicle flaps or free flaps. Hard palate separates nasal and oral cavities. Due to the small surface area between flap and remaining palate after surgical resections, optimal blood supply of the flaps for hard palate reconstructions are needed. This article demonstrates immediate reconstruction of two edentulous hemimaxillectomy patients with <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> Island flap and brief review of this flap discussed. ...|$|E
30|$|There were 30 (88.2  %) {{males and}} 4 (11.8  %) females (male/female[*]=[*] 15 : 2) aged between 25 and 40  years. The {{origin of the}} sublingual artery was mainly from the lingual artery (73.5  %), the <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> (17.6  %), or an anastomotic branch from the two arteries (8.9  %). The mean {{distance}} between the mandibular midline lingual foramen (MMLF) and the inferior border of the mandible was 15.58  mm (range 11.03 – 19.62  mm). The mean thickness of the mandible {{at the level of}} the MMLF was 10.89  mm (range 8.00 – 12.91  mm). No statistically significant difference was found between the two genders with regard to the morphometric measurements.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} in the anterior mandible {{is considered by}} many clinicians to be a relatively low risk procedure. However, hemorrhagic episodes following implant placement in the mandibular symphysis are regularly reported and can have serious consequences. The use of high resolution focused cone beam scanners has given us the ability to visualize the intricate neurovascular network of the intraforaminal region without distortion and in greater detail. Knowledge of the arterial supply, and navigated implant placement in the mandibular symphysis, can help to avoid these potentially life-threatening emergencies.

30|$|There are {{two main}} sources of {{arterial}} blood supply to the anterior lingual area of the mandible: the submental and the lingual arteries. There is however lack of consensus as to {{the origin of the}} artery that enters the MMLF. Some authors have reported that it is a branch of the lingual artery and others the <b>submental</b> <b>artery,</b> while others have found that the vessel is an anastomosis of the two arteries [2, 6, 7, 9, 13]. The possibility of existence of anastomoses and the lack of consensus as to the source of the artery that enters the MMLF pose a dilemma of whether the submental or the lingual artery should be ligated first in the event an extra-oral approach is required to control haemorrhage [7].|$|E
40|$|Having {{up-to-date}} {{knowledge of}} the variability in facial artery topography is an essential starting point in performing certain surgical and radiological procedures {{on the head and}} neck (e. g. oromucosal reconstruction flaps, transarterial embolization). We report a unique case with: (1) the left facial artery truncating as an atypical inferior labial artery, (2) the left anterolateral face being perfused by unusual arterial collaterals derived from the right superior labial, left infraorbital and left dorsal nasal arteries, (3) the transverse facial artery not being one of the perfusing collaterals, and (4) the right <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> piercing the mylohyoid muscle and entering the oral cavity. The embryologic basis of this atypical vascular pattern is discussed. Discovery of a highly atypical facial artery highlights the importance of performing a thorough pre-operative vascular evaluation to prevent iatrogenic injuries and complications before any surgical or therapeutic procedure...|$|E
40|$|Statement of Problem: The {{anterior}} mandible has conventionally {{been deemed}} {{as a relatively}} “safe zone” for dental implants due to perceived lack of innervation to the area {{as well as its}} relatively thick cortices and dense bone. However, with the evolution of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), a number of anatomic challenges have been identified by clinicians that can lead to neuropathy and life-threatening hemorrhage if violated. The three critical anatomic structures in this area that pertain to implant placement are the sublingual artery (SLA), <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> (SMA), and the mandibular incisive canal. Currently, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge regarding average measurements of these anatomic structures in relation to a specific non-variable landmark. Furthermore, it is not known if there are any significant variations of these anatomic structures in dentate and edentulous patients. While these structures may be identifiable on a CBCT scan, mandatory CBCTs are not required by practitioners in order to perform implant surgery in the anterior mandible. Purpose: To determine if standardized average values can be obtained for the sublingual artery (SLA), <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> (SMA), and mandibular incisive canal (MIC), and if differences exist between dentate and edentulous patients. Materials and Methods: CBCTs of 125 edentulous and 100 dentate subjects were evaluated at the anterior mandible for incidence of visualization of the SLA, SMA, and MIC. Measurements of these three structures were also made from the inferior cortical border of the mandible to the superior border of each structure in order to gain average anatomical measurements. The cross-sectional shapes of anterior mandibles were also categorized and prevalence of each shape in this sample was calculated. Results: The incidence of visualization of the SLA on CBCT was found to be 100 % for edentulous subjects and 98 % for dentate subjects. The SLA was located approximately 15 mm above the inferior border of the mandible. The incidence of visualization of the SMA on CBCT was 94 % for edentulous subjects and 88 % for dentate subjects. The SMA was located approximately 5 mm above the inferior border of the mandible. The incidence of visualization of the MIC on CBCT was 61 % for edentulous subjects and 59 % for dentate subjects. The MIC was found to be approximately 1. 5 mm in diameter at the lateral incisor and canine regions. The MIC was located approximately 11 mm above the inferior border of the mandible in edentulous patients, and approximately 14 mm above the inferior border of the mandible in dentate patients. The edentulous mandibular ridge attained a buccal-lingual width of 6 mm at a mean distance of 4 mm below the ridge crest in this patient sample. A new classification system for the cross-sectional morphology of the anterior mandible was characterized and includes the following shapes: hourglass, ovoid, pear, sickle, and triangular. The pear was the most commonly visualized cross-sectional morphology among both edentulous and dentate patients. Conclusions: The sublingual artery and <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> can be consistently identified in the anterior mandible using CBCT, both in dentate and edentulous patients. The SLA was located approximately 15 mm above the inferior border of the mandible and the SMA was located approximately 5 mm above the inferior border of the mandible. The mandibular incisive canal was not consistently visualized. The cross-sectional morphology of the anterior mandible is diverse in dentate and edentulous mandibles with pear shape being the most common in both situations. These findings should be taken into consideration when treatment planning for implants using CBCT or panoramic radiography...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{feasibility}} of the submental island flap in the repair of hypopharyngeal defects. Methods: We collected wet specimens of fresh cadaveric heads from the Han Chinese adult population for applied anatomy of the submental island flap, and followed five patients with pyriform sinus carcinoma after reconstruction surgery using submental island flaps. Results: We found that the average length and width of the submental island flaps were (65. 20 Â Â±Â  11. 69) mm and (46. 70 Â Â±Â  6. 59) Â mm, respectively. The skin flap in all five patients survived after surgery, and tracheal tubes and gastric tubes were removed 7 â 36 days after surgery. Patients were followed up for 24 â 42 months, pharyngeal flaps grew well, and speech and swallowing functions were satisfactory. Conclusion: The submental island flap is a preferred material for the repair of hypopharyngeal defects after hypopharyngeal carcinoma resection, because of good blood supply, easy harvesting, and high survival rate.

40|$|Lagophthalmos is {{the result}} of the {{paralysis}} of orbicularis oculi in facial palsy, which can lead to ulceration of the eye and blindness. Unlike static procedures, muscle transfer surgery allows the restoration of involuntary blink reflexes of the orbicularis oris. As the platysma is like the orbicularis oculi in thickness, it is hypothesised the platysma would be an ideal candidate for muscle transfer surgery. The aim was to determine the neurovasculature of the platysma for reanimation of the orbit. Results were consistent between one platysma from cadaver A (A) and one platysma from cadaver B (B). The number of arterial branches identified in each platysma were as follows: facial artery A- 7, B- 2; <b>submental</b> <b>artery</b> A- 3, B- 1; and occipital artery A- 1, B- 1. The venous drainage branches identified were: anterior jugular vein A- 1, B- 2; external jugular vein A- 2, B- 1; and facial vein A- 2, B- 1. All nerves were identified as branches of the facial nerve: A- 7, B- 7. From the dissection it was found the posterosuperior lateral portion of platysma was more vascular rich; containing branches from the facial artery and facial vein, as well as the facial nerve. This portion of the muscle therefore has potential for use as a muscle transfer flap in surgery, as the rich neurovascular allows adequate rewiring for dynamic restoration. In particular, the muscle transfer flaps would allow the application of the trouser graft procedure, for reanimation of the whole orbit...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{skin and}} soft tissues {{of the face}} and neck have a rich plexus of dermal-subdermal vessels, which creates the {{possibility}} of raising a fasciocutaneous flap based on this vascular supply. A turned in fasciocutaneous island flap (TIFCIF) from an adjacent area of the defect can provide a simple substitute to many complex reconstructive procedures. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients underwent wide excision for oral cancer and upper neck dissection, maintaining bone framework, between August 2010 and June 2014. The reconstruction was done with a 'turned in fasciocutaneous island flap' (TIFCIF) from the upper neck-lower face based on subdermal superficial adipofascial microvascular network instead of a specific known feeder vessel. The upper cervical flap, the donor site, when raised during the initial incision and the upper neck dissection, was {{cut off from the}} facial artery, the <b>submental</b> <b>artery,</b> the superior thyroid and the transverse cervical arteries. The microcirculation depended largely on the rich vascular plexus formed of the branches of the superficial temporal and the maxillary arteries. The donor site was primarily closed in Fourteen of the Fifteen patients. Eight patients received post-surgery irradiation. Results: All the flaps survived and healed and withstood radiation well. Two patients had flap dehiscence from suture line, of which one needed reattachment while other a minor one healed by itself and one patient had occasional drooling. There was no difficulty in eating or swallowing. Conclusions: A random patterned TIFCIF based on superficial subdermal adipofascial microcirculation, formed of a rich vascular plexus in the face and neck region can provide a simple alternative for intraoral reconstruction...|$|E
