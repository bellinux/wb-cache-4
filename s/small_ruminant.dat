5|$|The Polled Dorset is a {{breed of}} sheep {{developed}} for meat at the North Carolina State University <b>Small</b> <b>Ruminant</b> Unit in 1956. The name refers {{to the fact that}} it is a hornless variation of the Horned Dorset breed. The Polled Dorset is the result of a genetic mutation by which some of the offspring of a certain ram grew no horns. After some years of breeding work, a strain of Dorset was developed which had lost the characteristic horns and which bred true.|$|E
500|$|In 1949, four hornless lambs were sired from a Horned Dorset {{on a farm}} at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. Over {{the next}} five years, {{as part of their}} normal {{breeding}} program, those four ewes and the other ewes on the farm were bred to the Horned Dorset. Eventually, a ewe gave birth to twin rams. NCSU 401 was a regular horned Dorset, but his brother, [...] "NCSU 402", was born polled, without horns, due to a genetic mutation. Thus, the Polled Dorset was born. NCSU 402 was the official name given to the first true Polled Dorset sheep. It was named in accordance with the naming system that has been used at the NCSU <b>Small</b> <b>Ruminant</b> Unit since it started its breeding program.|$|E
60|$|On the pampas there is, {{strictly}} speaking, {{only one}} ruminant, the Cervus campestris, which is common.

It is really astonishing that only one <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> should be found on this immense grassy area, so admirably suited to herbivorous quadrupeds, a portion of which at the present moment affords sufficient pasture to eighty millions of sheep, cattle, and horses.

40|$|Objectives To {{simultaneously}} {{estimate the}} prevalence of antibodies against Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) among adults and <b>small</b> <b>ruminants,</b> and C. burnetii shedding prevalence among <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> in households in the Kiang West district of The Gambia; and to assess associated risk factors. Methods Sera of 599 adults and 615 <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> from 125 compounds within 12 villages were tested for antibodies against C. burnetii using ELISA. Vaginal swabs and milk samples of 155 <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> were tested using PCR to investigate shedding of C. burnetii. Results 3. 8 % to 9. 7 % of adults, depending on ELISA test cutoff, and 24. 9 % of <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> in Kiang West were seropositive. Having at least one seropositive animal in one's compound was {{a risk factor for}} human seropositivity (OR 3. 35, 95 % CI: 1. 09 - 14. 44). A grazing area within a village was a risk factor for seropositivity in <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> (OR 2. 07, 95 % CI: 1. 26 - 3. 50); others were having lambed (OR 2. 75, 95 % CI: 1. 37 - 5. 76), and older age of the animals (OR 2. 75, 95 % CI: 1. 37 - 5. 76 for 1 - 3 years and OR 5. 84, 95 % CI: 3. 10 - 11. 64 for > 3 years). 57. 4 % of sampled <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> were shedding C. burnetii. Conclusion C. burnetii infection is endemic among both humans and <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> in this area of The Gambia. Human and animal exposure to C. burnetii were related at compound-level.

40|$|Background Brucellosis is a {{worldwide}} zoonosis with {{significant impact on}} rural livelihoods and a potentially underestimated contributor to febrile illnesses. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in humans and <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> in The Gambia. Methods The study was carried out in rural and urban areas. In 12 rural villages in Kiang West district, sera were collected from humans (n = 599) and <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> (n = 623) from the same compounds. From lactating <b>small</b> <b>ruminants,</b> milk samples and vaginal swabs were obtained. At the urban study sites, sera were collected from <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> (n = 500) from slaughterhouses and livestock markets. Information on possible risk factors for seropositivity was collected through questionnaires. Sera were screened for antibodies against Brucella spp. with the Rose Bengal Test, ELISA and Micro Agglutination Test (human sera only). PCR was performed on 10 percent of the milk samples and vaginal swabs from <b>small</b> <b>ruminants.</b> Results One human and 14 sheep sera were positive by the Rose Bengal Test. The rest were negative in all serological tests used. The PCR results were all negative. Conclusions The results suggest that brucellosis is currently not a generalized problem in humans or <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> in The Gambia. </p...|$|R

The present study was carried out to investigate risk factors of PPRV in domestic <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> which {{were present in the}} vicinity of wildlife parks. A total of 265 sera samples (27 wild ruminants and 238 domesticated <b>small</b> <b>ruminants)</b> from apparently healthy animals from two different wildlife parks were collected and analysed for PPRV antibodies. Also, 20 nasal swabs from domestic <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> showing respiratory signs were collected to check for presence of PPRV antigen. Competitive ELISA revealed highest proportions of anti-PPRV antibodies in domestic <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> around the Wildlife Park at Lahore (35 %) as compared to Faisalabad (13 %), with no existence of PPRV antibodies in tested serum of wild ruminants at these parks. Higher seropositivity was observed in females (25. 6 %) than in males (5. 1 %) and in goats (34. 5 %) compared to sheep (11. 2 %). The results of N-gene based RT-PCR highlight the absence of PPRV due to lack of current PPR outbreak in the region during study period. Even though grazing was not a significant risk factor, there is still a possibility of wildlife-livestock interactions for feed and water reservoirs, resulting in spillover of PPR to wildlife. Keeping in view the high seropositivity and risk of PPR, vaccination should be adopted to avoid circulation of PPRV among wild and domestic <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> (sheep and goats) ...|$|R

The present study was conducted to evaluate our hypothesis by investigating the rates if infections different flocks of <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> populated in various localities with varied ecological conditions in southernmost part of Punjab, Pakistan. Materials and Method: The blood samples collected from mixed farms of sheep and goats were examined by Latex Agglutination Test to detect rates of seroprevalence of anti-Toxoplasma antibodies. Statistical analyses were applied to ascertain the correlation between habitat variations and rates of toxoplasmosis in three distinct regions of study area including sand dunes of Cholistan desert, Agricultural Region and Marshy areas. Results: The total infection rates collectively found in <b>small</b> <b>ruminants</b> were 31. 41 %.

50|$|Visna Maedi virus (VMV) {{belongs to}} the <b>small</b> <b>ruminant</b> {{lentivirus}} group (SRLV). In general, SRLVs enter the cell through the interaction of their glycosylated envelope protein with a cellular receptor on the cell's plasma membrane facilitating fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. However, the specific cellular receptor that VMV binds is not entirely certain. A few studies have proposed MHC class II, CD4 and CXCR4 proteins as possible receptors however, none of these proteins have been established as the main receptor. Another study suggests that C-type lectins part of the mannose receptor (MR) family play a role as an alternative SRLV receptor. The mannose receptor is a 180-kDa transmembrane protein with eight tandem C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of which CRD4 and CRD5 are essential in recognizing mannose, fucose and N-acetyl glucosamine residues. Studies suggest that VMV gains entrance to the cell via mannosylated residues on its envelope proteins. MR is involved in recognizing the surface of pathogens and is involved in phago- and endocytosis and mediating antigen processing and presentation {{in a variety of}} cells including monocyte/macrophages and endothelial cells.|$|E
