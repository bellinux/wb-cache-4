25|$|Nanotechnology has the {{potential}} to reshape the entire world, Kurzweil exclaims. Assembling materials molecule by molecule could solve energy problems, cure cancer and other diseases, <b>strengthen</b> <b>our</b> bodies, and produce self-assembling food, clothing, and buildings. Kurzweil admits that nanotechnology carries a big risk; a self-replicating substance, without the constraints of a living organism, might grow out of control and consume everything. However he points out that today there are already technologies which pose grave risks, for example nuclear power or weapons, and we have managed to keep them relatively safe, so he feels we can probably do the same with nanotechnology.|$|E

25|$|If {{people ask}} {{in the name}} of {{religion}} we must help them. The vehicle of this support is a complete boycott of the enemies' goods. Each riyal, dirham …etc. used to buy their goods eventually becomes bullets to be fired at the hearts of brothers and children in Palestine. For this reason, it is an obligation not to help them (the enemies of Islam) by buying their goods. To buy their goods is to support tyranny, oppression and aggression. Buying goods from them will strengthen them; our duty is to make them as weak as we can. Our obligation is to <b>strengthen</b> <b>our</b> resisting brothers in the Sacred Land as much as we can. If we cannot strengthen the brothers, we have a duty to make the enemy weak. If their weakness cannot be achieved except by boycott, we must boycott them.|$|E

[...] Churchill informed Cabinet of the decision on 7 July 1954. The Cabinet, particularly the Lord Privy Seal, Harry Crookshank, were not happy about not being consulted. Cabinet debated the matter that day and the next, before postponing a final decision. On 27 July 1954, the Lord President of the Council, the Marquess of Salisbury, raised the matter, {{although it was not}} on the agenda, stressing the need for a decision. This time Cabinet agreed to proceed with the development of thermonuclear weapons.|$|E
500|$|The {{successful}} {{nuclear test}} of a British atomic bomb in Operation Hurricane in October 1952 represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement.

In November 1952, the United States conducted the first successful {{test of a}} true thermonuclear device or hydrogen bomb. Britain was therefore still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology.

500|$|The Catechism of the Catholic Church {{encourages}} meditation {{as a form}} of prayer: [...] "Meditation {{is above}} all a quest. The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking" [...] (Catechism section # 2705) and that Christians owe it to themselves to develop the desire to meditate regularly (# 2707). Emphasizing union with God, it states: [...] "Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and <b>strengthen</b> <b>our</b> will to follow Christ. Christian prayer tries above all to meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in lectio divina or the rosary. This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but Christian prayer should go further: to the knowledge of the love of the Lord Jesus, to union with him" [...] (#2708). Meditative prayer is different from contemplative prayer (See CCC 2709-2724).|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2008–09 season, Myrie-Williams was {{released}} by Bristol City. In June 2009, he joined Dundee United on a free transfer, signing a two-year deal with the Scottish Premier League club. Dundee United manager Craig Levein stated [...] "I am excited about the signing and I am sure he will develop into a real talent. Jennison is a player I've known about and admired for some time and up to about two years ago I would have said {{he was one of the}} brightest prospects in the country. He is a player who will not only excite the fans with his direct, quick running at defences, but he will also add pace to the team and <b>strengthen</b> <b>our</b> options going forward". Myrie-Williams made his Dundee United debut on 22 August 2009, coming on as an 88th-minute substitute in a 0–0 draw at St Mirren. He made a further two appearances as a late substitute, before starting his first game for Dundee United in the club's 2–0 away win against Ross County in the League Cup on 22 September 2009. He made his first league start on 17 October 2009, playing 84 minutes in a 1–1 home draw against Hamilton Academical, earning the 'Man of the Match' award for his performance. Myrie-Williams was again named as the 'Man of the Match' for his performance in a 2–1 win against Celtic at Tannadice on 22 November 2009— the club's website reported that he made [...] "the most creative impact during the game" [...] and that he [...] "continued his fine form of late and in doing so gave Celtic left back Danny Fox a torrid 90 minutes". He scored his first competitive goal for Dundee United in a 3–2 home win against St Mirren on 5 December 2009, scoring the club's third with a neat finish. He was on the scoresheet again in January 2010, scoring in a game against St Johnstone, Myrie-Williams' goal gave Dundee United the lead after trailing 2–0 at half-time, although the game ended 3–3. Myrie-Williams received the first red card of his career when he was sent-off for two bookable offences in the side's 2–0 home loss against Celtic on 25 April 2010. He played in the club's 2–0 win over Raith Rovers in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but was not selected for the Hampden Park final itself.
