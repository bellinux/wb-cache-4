The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) was used to assess physical activity levels and types. <b>Static</b> <b>balance</b> indicating the path length and the body sway area of the center of pressure was measured by five <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> tests using the static force platform. The tests included standing on one leg with eyes opened, standing on two legs with feet apart and together, and being in the two-leg stance positions with eyes opened and closed. Thirty-seven subjects completed all measurements. In the total sample, most (55. 32 %) PASE points were accounted for by household-related activity, and the PASE scores were between 20. 04 and 222. 07. But there was no significant difference between <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and physical activity levels, and between <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and various physical activity types. However, <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> with eyes opened was significantly better than with eyes closed.

50|$|<b>Static</b> <b>balancing</b> {{machines}} {{differ from}} hard- and soft-bearing machines {{in that the}} part is not rotated to take a measurement. Rather than resting on its bearings, the part rests vertically on its geometric center. Once at rest, any movement by the part away from its geometric center is detected by two perpendicular sensors beneath the table and returned as unbalance. Static balancers are often used to balance parts with a diameter much larger than their length, such as fans. The advantages of using a static balancer are speed and price. However a static balancer can only correct in one plane, so its accuracy is limited.|$|E
50|$|There are 3 {{degrees to}} which {{balancing}} may be pursued. The most basic is <b>static</b> <b>balancing</b> of the off-center features on a driving wheel, i.e. the crankpin and its attached parts. In addition, balancing {{a proportion of}} the reciprocating parts {{can be done with}} additional revolving weight. This weight is combined with that required for the off-center parts on the wheel and this extra weight causes the wheel to be overbalanced resulting in hammer blow. Lastly, because the above balance weights are in the plane of the wheel and not in the plane of the originating unbalance, the wheel/axle assembly is not dynamically balanced. Dynamic balancing on steam locomotives is known as cross-balancing and is 2-plane balancing with the second plane being in the opposite wheel.|$|E

50|$|Static balance can be {{measured}} by a <b>static</b> <b>balancing</b> machine where the tire is placed in its vertical axis on a non-rotating spindle tool. The spot on the tire with the greatest mass is acted upon by gravity to deflect the tooling downward. The amount of deflection indicates {{the magnitude of the}} unbalance. The angle of the deflection indicates the angular location of the unbalance. In tire manufacturing factories, static balancers operate by use of sensors mounted to the spindle assembly. In tire retail shops, static balancers are usually non-rotating bubble balancers, where the magnitude and angle of the unbalance is observed by looking at the center bubble in an oil-filled glass sighting gauge.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether spinal cord stimulation (SCS) {{has a negative}} effect on <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and gait, which is implicated by the increased incidence of falls leading to frequently occurring lead migrations. Materials and Methods: A controlled trial is performed with 11 subjects (four female, seven male) {{with a mean age of}} 46 years old. A baseline measurement consisting of <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and gait tests was performed. Within two weeks after implantation of a spinal cord stimulator, subjects performed the same tests with both stimulation switched on and off. <b>Static</b> <b>balance</b> was assessed with eyes open and eyes closed on hard surface and foam surface. The velocity of the center of pressure and weight symmetry were the main outcome parameters. Kinematics and spatiotemporal outcome parameters were used to analyze gait. ANOVAs were used to compare between baseline, stimulation on, and stimulation off. Results: Spinal cord stimulation resulted in significant pain relief as scored on a Visual Analog Scale (p < 0. 001). Gait width decreased and this change (indicative of improvement in balance) was significant (p = 0. 007). No other significant group differences were found between stimulation baseline and post-surgery measurements. SCS did not influence <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> or gait when group effects were analyzed. Four subjects showed significant differences in <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> between stimulation on and off. Conclusions: The lack of group differences in normal gait and <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> cannot explain the increased incidence of falls. However, four subjects showed an effect of SCS on <b>static</b> <b>balance.</b> Further research to clarify why only a part of the subjects experienced balance problems is recommended and assessments of more demanding balance and gait tasks are desirable...|$|R

40|$|A unique {{click-clack}} tin-lid {{mechanism is}} analyzed here. This mechanism {{has the feature}} to be switched between its two stable states by applying forces along different lines of action at two different points, called ports here. The 3 D click-clack tin-lid mechanism is modified to design a planar fully-compliant two-port bistable mechanism. By using the theory presented in this paper, a bistable mechanism can be designed to have a mechanical advantage. An analytical kinetoelastic model is used to explain the energy behavior of the mechanism and gain insights into applying it in practice. To account for varying loads experienced by the mechanism during switching, bistability is combined with <b>static</b> <b>balancing.</b> Such a mechanism is amenable {{to the design of}} an easy-chair to ease the suffering of arthritic and elderly users. Thus, a sit-to-stand easy-chair is designed where a small force applied on the armrest can gently propel and ease rising from it. <b>Static</b> <b>balancing</b> is implemented to partially compensate for the weight of the patient and to reduce the jerky motion arising from bistability.

40|$|The role {{of balance}} and balance {{training}} in athletic performance: [...] Balance has long been recognized as {{an important factor in}} a number of sports (such as gymnastics, and figure skating) and more recently has been regarded as important in other sports as well. Lack of balance {{has been shown to be}} detrimental to optimal performance through decreases in strength and force production, increased fatigue as well as predisposition to injury. Much of the research regarding balance training focuses on injury rehabilitation and prevention with little focus on examining the effects of short and long term balance training on athletic performance. The purpose of this paper is therefore to provide a comprehensive review of literature regarding balance, short and long term effects of balance training and its possible beneficial effects on athletic performance. [...] The objective of this study was to determine the effects <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and dynamic balance training on muscle activation strategies, <b>static</b> <b>balance,</b> jump and sprint performance. Twenty-four recreationally active females were tested pre- and post-training (<b>static</b> <b>balance</b> training, n= 11, dynamic balance training, n = 7 and control group, n = 6). Experimental subjects completed either <b>static</b> or dynamic <b>balance</b> exercises 4 times per week for 6 weeks. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to assess preparatory and reactive muscle activity of the rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), and the soleus during one- and two-foot landings. Maximum vertical jump, <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and sprint times were also examined. A 3 -way ANOVA revealed a significant (p<. 05) increase in reactive rectus femoris activity, as well as a group by time interaction for the reactive rectus femoris activity. The <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> group showed a 33 % increase in reactive rectus femoris activity (p<. 01).

Objective: The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the effect of 8 weeks of Whole Body Vibration (WBV) training on <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and explosive strength of the lower limbs, using two different training intensities vibration protocols. Methods: Eighty-three physical education students (age 19. 39 &# 8239;&# 177;&# 8239; 2. 35 &# 8239;years) volunteered to participate in an 8 -week WBV training. They were randomly divided into two groups with 30 &# 8239;sec and 60 &# 8239;sec duration of vibration exposure per exercise, total volume of exercise was the same for both groups. The explosive strength of the lower limbs was assessed by a squat jump and <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> by Balance Error Scoring System at the baseline (pre-test) and after 8 weeks of WBV training at 15 &# 8239;sec, 5, 10, and 15 &# 8239;min after the end of WBV exposure. A two-way ANOVA 2 × 5 (protocol × time) with repeated measures on both factors was used. Univariate analyses with simple contrasts across time were selected as post hoc tests. Results: Results showed a time × protocol interaction effect for <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> (p&# 8239;&# 8239;. 05). Furthermore, a time effect was found for the <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and squat jump test.

This pushed {{for the development of a}} statically balanced frequency up-converter, that can integrate an energy harvester capable of coping with low frequencies vibrations of broadband nature. On the <b>static</b> <b>balancing</b> ground, a new mechanism is proposed, with the balancing of the folded suspension, a traditional mechanism of precision engineering. Numerical analysis suggests that high quality balancing is achieved for a large amplitude of motion. A preliminary study is also executed, introducing bond graph modeling to the field of energy harvesting. Bond graphs are a natural representation for the cross-domain nature of energy harvesters, allowing an integrative view.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{disclosed}} {{significant relationships between}} balance ability and central nervous system functioning of children. These studies report that balance ability {{can be an important}} neurological indication relating to the developmental functioning of children. Along this line, many researchers are interested in balance ability of motor functioning in retarded children. It is well recognized that mentally retarded children tend to show poor motor functioning, especially, in balance ability. However, a developmental mechanism of <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> ability in this population remains unexplored. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate characteristics of <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> ability in mentally retarded children. One hundred and six retarded children ranging in age from 6 to 18 years with a mean of 14. 9 years were selected from special schools as subjects. These children were divided into five groups: mentally retarded, autistic, epileptic, Down's syndrome, and cerebral palsied. All subjects were capable of upright standing posture for 20 seconds. <b>Static</b> <b>balance</b> ability of these children was measured by using the Gravicored which records gravity change of body sway at standing position with both legs. Major findings were as follows:(1) All subjects showed significant delay in overall balance abilities in comparison with non-retarded children of the same age. (2) Autistic, epileptic, and cerebral palsied children showed significantly less <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> ability than mentally retarded children. (3) Autistic, epileptic and cerebral palsied children showed no significant differences in their <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> ability, while mentally retarded and Down's syndrome children showed a significant difference in their <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> ability. These researchers conclude that mentally retarded children possess delayed motor characteristics which differ from those of autistic and cerebral palsied children...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Individuals {{with visual}} {{impairments}} have poorer balance compared to their sighted peers. The present research was carried out {{with the purpose of}} investigating the effect of front crawl swimming on the <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> in boys {{with visual impairments}}.   Methods: The current research was a quasi-experimental study with pretest-posttest design. Statistical population included 20 boys with visual impairments (aged 9 to 15 years) who were member of Society for the Blind in Arak city. The subjects were purposefully selected and randomly assigned to two equal groups. Flamingo <b>Static</b> <b>Balance</b> Test was used to evaluate <b>static</b> <b>balance.</b> The experimental group was asked to participate in front crawl swimming trainings for 10 -week (2 days/week). Both groups performed a pretest prior to the training period and performed a posttest 2 days {{after the end of the}} training period in the same environment. Shapiro-Wilk, independent t-, and paired t-tests were used for data analysis at the significance level of 0. 95 % and α≤ 0 / 05.   Results: No significant difference was seen between experimental and control groups in the pretest of <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> (p> 0. 05). The paired t-test showed significant difference in the <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> in experimental group (p 0. 05). In the posttest, there was also a significant difference between the scores of the two groups (p< 0. 05).   Conclusion: The result of the present study indicated that front crawl swimming trainings improve the <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> in boys with visual impairment. Thus, it seems that use of these trainings in exercise and rehabilitation programs of these individuals can have many benefits for them...|$|R
