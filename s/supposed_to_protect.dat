5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be inborn. In many regions it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were born with a caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaći.|$|E

This, however, sat ill with the Neapolitan people and nobles; nor was Joan content to share her sovereignty. With the approval of Pope Clement VI, Joan was crowned as sole monarch of Naples in August 1344. Fearing for his life, Andrew wrote to his mother Elizabeth that he would soon flee the kingdom. She intervened, and made a state visit; before she returned to Hungary, she bribed Pope Clement to reverse himself and permit the coronation of Andrew. She also gave a ring to Andrew, which was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> him from death by blade or poison, and returned with {{a false sense of}} security to Hungary.|$|E

25|$|According to the Vietnamese Legislation, {{the entire}} {{population}} owns the water resources and single users and organizations are legally allowed to use {{them in order to}} meet their daily life and production. Apart from that, they are obligated {{to take care of a}} responsible water use and are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> all water resources. Nevertheless, the management of water resources is uniformly organized by the state. The legal framework concerning the management of water resources in general and the irrigation framework in particular is quite complicated in structure. Mainly, there are two documents providing rules and regulations for the use of water resources for irrigation. These are the Law on Water Resources (from the year 1998) and the Law on Land (replaced 1993). Especially for irrigation, there is the ordinance for the Exploitation and Protection of Irrigation Works and there are different secondary regulations concerning water use and the protection of water resources. Besides, Vietnam has approved of and ratified different international conventions. The most important ones are the Ramsar convention (1989), the International Convention on Biodiversity (1993), the Agreement on the Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin (1195), the Basel Convention (1995), the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (2002), the UN Framework on Climate Change (2002), the Kyoto Protocol on the Clean Development Mechanism (2002).|$|E

2500|$|Debo's {{next book}} was more controversial. Completed in 1936, And Still the Waters Run {{detailed}} how, after their forced removal from the southeastern United States, the Five Civilized Tribes were systematically deprived in Indian Territory of the lands and resources granted {{to them by}} federal treaty. Debo wrote that these treaties were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the tribal lands [...] "{{as long as the}} waters run, as long as the grass grows"; but, after the 1887 Dawes Act enacted a policy of private ownership that was eventually forced on the tribes, the system was manipulated by whites to swindle the Indians out of their property. In the words of historian Ellen Fitzpatrick, Debo's book [...] "advanced a crushing analysis of the corruption, moral depravity, and criminal activity that underlay white administration and execution of the allotment policy." ...|$|E
2500|$|An ASBO {{was very}} similar to a civil {{injunction}} even though the differences are important. First, the injunction was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the world at large, in a given geographical area, rather than an individual. Second, breach of an ASBO was a criminal offence to be tried in a criminal court applying the criminal standard of beyond all reasonable doubt. A power of committal to prison was available for breach of a civil injunction but a court was unlikely to exercise that power. A person subject to an anti-social behaviour order where it did not follow a criminal conviction had an {{automatic right of appeal}} against both the making of the order and its terms to a higher court. There was also the availability of an appeal to the High Court by way of [...] "case stated". There was no appeal against the variation of orders, and variation was used to add extra conditions and to extend the duration of ASBOs.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} pre-revolution articles to link the death of Saeed to an imminent nationwide explosion came from Saeed's neighbor, Egyptian-Australian Amro Ali. In an opinion piece titled , Ali writes an intimate portrayal of Saeed and the Alexandria context, {{as well as the}} ramifications of his death for the regime. Ali states [...] "Saeed's tragedy is Egypt's tragedy. A young man, neither a political activist nor religious radical, but an ordinary Egyptian whose accused actions could not in any way warrant his lynching. Saeed was someone's son, someone's brother, someone's friend, someone's neighbour, someone's customer, and if not for what had happened, someone's future. Saeed was, in the local vernacular, a son of Cleopatra [...] Yet the system that was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> him and give him his rights, took away those rights by taking away his life... It is one extra nail in the coffin of the ever-widening gulf between the ruler and ruled... What the Egyptian establishment maybe forgetting... is that pigeons come home to roost more than once." [...] Ali would later publish a personal and analytical account in Jadaliyya on the second anniversary of Saeed's death: [...] As well as analysing what really happened to Saeed, Ali also examines the dynamics of how Saeed was rapidly mythologized and the ramifications it has produced in Egyptian society.|$|E

60|$|Scarcely was I {{ready when}} the yellow-faced servants, with many bows, {{took me by}} the hand and led me down the {{passages}} and stairs of the Gate-house to its door. Here, to my great joy, I found Leo, looking pale and troubled, but otherwise as well as I could expect after his sickness. He was attired like myself, save that his garments were of a finer quality, and the overcoat was white, with a hood to it, added, I <b>suppose,</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the wound in his head from cold and the sun. This white dress I thought became him very well, also about it there was nothing grotesque or even remarkable. He sprang to me and seized my hand, asking how I fared and where I had been hidden away, a greeting of which, as I could see, the warmth was not lost upon Simbri, who stood by.|$|R
