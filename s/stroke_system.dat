Further development of the <b>stroke</b> <b>system</b> enables the user to specify an angle from which the stroke is calculated by using stored stroke functions.

Supporting long-term recovery and rehabilitation are necessary to help stroke survivors adapt to living with the effects of stroke and to help family members adapt to the caregiving role. During recovery and rehabilitation, many elements of the health care continuum are utilized, including emergency response, acute care, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation, and community and long-term care. With the advent of thrombolytic therapy and the benefits of stroke units, stroke survival and outcomes are improving. As a result, the current emphasis of <b>stroke</b> <b>system</b> improvement is to implement stroke units throughout the developed world. To enhance the patient centeredness of stroke care delivery, an important next phase of <b>stroke</b> <b>system</b> improvement will center on the experiences of stroke survivors and their family caregivers as they move through diverse care environments.

40|$|Background/PurposeCode <b>stroke</b> <b>systems</b> {{are widely}} {{implemented}} to expedite acute stroke treatment. Although this system requires considerable resources, {{so far no}} reimbursement has been provided by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) in Taiwan. We investigated how often a code stroke was initiated {{and the percentage of}} patients treated with intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator, and draw attention to the resulting mismatch. MethodsFrom January 2010 to September 2011, we prospectively registered all consecutive code stroke patients. Patient characteristics, including demographic data, medical history, comorbidity conditions, treatments, and discharge diagnosis were collected, together with the exact time of onset (or last known normal time) and management. The eligibility of thrombolysis for each patient recorded originally on the chart was reviewed retrospectively on the basis of two sets of criteria, namely, the BNHI reimbursement criteria and the Taiwan Stroke Society (TSS) guideline. ResultsDuring the study period, code strokes were activated for 419 patients at an average of around 20 patients per month. About 57 % of code strokes were initiated outside of office hours. Stroke was diagnosed in 377 (90 %) patients and 304 (73 %) patients had ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. A total of 42 (10 %) patients according to the BNHI reimbursement criteria and 101 (24 %) patients by the TSS guideline were eligible for IV thrombolytic therapy. Of all the code stroke patients, only 49 (12 %) were actually treated. Before each additional patient was thrombolysed, about eight patients had been evaluated and excluded from treatment.

Furthermore, owing to the complementary structure, the proposed machine possesses favorable fault-tolerant capability, namely, independent phases. In particular, differing from the existing fault-tolerant machines, the proposed machine offers fault tolerance without sacrificing thrust density. This is because neither fault-tolerant teeth nor the flux-barriers are adopted.

The current report describes the experience of implementing a countywide system of spoke-and-hub Stroke Neurology Receiving Centers (SNRC) that incorporated several comprehensive stroke center recommendations. METHODS Observational study of patients with suspected stroke < 5 hours duration transported by Emergency Medical System personnel to an SNRC {{during the first year of}} this system. RESULTS A total of 1, 360 patients with suspected stroke were evaluated at 9 hub SNRCs, of which 553 (40. 7 %) had a discharge diagnosis of ischemic stroke. Of these 553, intravenous (IV) tPA was given to 110 patients (19. 9 % of ischemic strokes). Care at the 6 neurointerventional-ready SNRC was a major focus, where 25. 1 % (99 / 395) of the patients with ischemic stroke received acute IV or intraarterial reperfusion therapy, and where provision of such therapies was less common with milder stroke, higher age, and Hispanic origin. The door-to-needle time for IV tPA met the < 60 minute target in only 25 % of patients and was 37 % longer (p= 0. 0001) when SNRCs were neurointerventional-ready.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke SiGN (Stroke Genetics Network) contributes substantially to meta-analyses that focus on specific subtypes of stroke. METHODS: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke SiGN includes ischemic stroke cases from 24 genetic research centers: 13 from the United States and 11 from Europe. Investigators harmonize ischemic stroke phenotyping using the Web-based causative classification of <b>stroke</b> <b>system,</b> with data entered by trained and certified adjudicators at participating genetic research centers.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: NINDS (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) -SiGN (Stroke Genetics Network) is an {{international}} consortium of ischemic stroke studies that aims to generate high-quality phenotype data to identify the genetic basis of pathogenic stroke subtypes. This analysis characterizes the etiopathogenetic basis of ischemic stroke and reliability of stroke classification in the consortium. METHODS: Fifty-two trained and certified adjudicators determined both phenotypic (abnormal test findings categorized in major pathogenic groups without weighting toward the most likely cause) and causative ischemic stroke subtypes in 16 954 subjects with imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke from 12 US studies and 11 studies from 8 European countries using the web-based Causative Classification of <b>Stroke</b> <b>System.</b> Classification reliability was assessed with blinded readjudication of 1509 randomly selected cases. RESULTS: The distribution of pathogenic categories varied by study, age, sex, and race (P< 0. 001 for each). Overall, only 40 % to 54 % of cases with a given major ischemic stroke pathogenesis (phenotypic subtype) were classified into the same final causative category with high confidence.

40|$|Stroke is {{the third}} {{most common cause of}} death and the sixth major cause of {{disability}} around the world with ischemic stroke accounting for around 80 % of all strokes. It has been clinically indicated in treating ischemic stroke patients that maximum benefits can be achieved with the speediest arterial recanalization by effective and fast application of existing acute therapies. These therapies comprise either (1) dissolving the blood clot using Intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator (IV tPA) treatment or (2) physically removing the clot from the artery using endovascular thrombectomy treatment. These treatments should be performed within the hyperacute time window of 6 hours from stroke onset. For nearly two decades until late 2014, the intravenous thrombolysis delivered to patients was the most effective treatment for stroke patients. This was administrated within a maximum of 4. 5 hours from stroke onset. In early 2015, results of five clinical trials from {{different parts of the world}} demonstrated the effectiveness of the endovascular thrombectomy therapy. This was provided within 6 hours of stroke onset for the eligible stroke patients who already have received thrombolysis treatment. Research presented in this thesis is the first attempt to quantify the link between the earlier treatment and long-term benefits for the hyperacute stroke patients. Moreover, with the gradual emergence of new evidence about effectiveness of the endovascular thrombectomy treatment in the hyperacute <b>stroke</b> care <b>systems,</b> new questions were raised in the clinical literature since not all hospitals have the expertise and equipment required for delivering the endovascular thrombectomy treatment. Some of the most burning questions were formulated in an Editorial article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by Warach and Johnson (2016). These questions mainly concern the issue of treatment pathway selection between two groups of hospitals with different facilities and expertise to support new investigations in the hyperacute <b>stroke</b> care <b>system</b> by comparing the long-term benefits for individual patients. This research demonstrates how Operations Research (OR) models can be used to answer these and other questions in the hyperacute <b>stroke</b> care <b>system.</b> It is specifically focused on OR models for investigation and improvement to provide better understanding of the complex decisions arising in the hyperacute <b>stroke</b> care <b>system.</b> The main aimof this thesis is to investigate the issue of design, development and validation of OR models used for investigation and improvement of the hyperacute <b>stroke</b> care <b>system.</b> Thus, this work addresses very recent and important questions in the field to support more effective and efficient provision of the services to stroke patients. Three OR models for investigation and improvement are designed and validated in this thesis: (1) &rsquo;IV tPA&rsquo; model, (2) &lsquo;Endovascular Thrombectomy&rsquo; model, and (3) &lsquo;Individual Patient&rsquo; model. The first two OR models are used to provide an understanding of the long-term population benefits of faster access to stroke treatment interventions. Based on the first two OR models, one minute earlier of IV tPA and endovascular thrombectomy interventions respectively on average provide 1. 8 days and 3. 2 extra days of healthy life for the stroke patients. The third OR model is used to provide assistance with maximizing the individual patient&rsquo;s life-time benefits over two pathways of the hyperacute <b>stroke</b> care <b>system.</b> Finally, we present a novel validation framework that is used to validate all three OR models developed in this thesis. This research contributes to OR/MS literature by design, development and validation of OR models used to provide an improved understanding of the long-term population and individual patient&rsquo;s benefits due to faster delivery of stroke treatment interventions in the hyperacute <b>stroke</b> care <b>system.</b> A discussion on the validation of OR models is also novel and further addresses the existing gaps in OR/MS literature...|$|R

Fisch relies on in-stroke word completion, a flexible design for fluidly turning unistroke letters into whole words. Fisch can be memorized at the motor level since word completions always appear at the same positions relative to the strokes being made. Our design for Fisch is suitable for use with any unistroke alphabet. We have implemented Fisch for multiple versions of EdgeWrite, and results show that Fisch reduces the number of strokes during entry by 43. 9 % while increasing the rate of entry. An informal test of “record speed ” with the stylus version resulted in 50 - 60 WPM with no uncorrected errors...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} new methodology {{of developing the}} brain stroke localization algorithm by using the machine-learning based pattern recognition approach for foreign object classification. Due to the new algorithm requires less bandwidth from the system hardware level, the proposed method {{would be helpful to}} reduce the challenges of designing a high-performance UWB antenna array required from most microwave <b>stroke</b> detection <b>system</b> nowadays. The presented algorithm employs the interconnection point of two lines that intersect the stroke region inside a brain and evaluates the properties of the stroke by using Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification method; the SVM classifier is trained by the data set acquired from EM simulations as well as the optimized coefficients from PSO algorithm. The proposed methodology of brain stroke classification has been verified by simulated data. The performance and effectiveness demonstrated it 2 ̆ 7 s a promising algorithm to be installed in the next-generation microwave brain <b>stroke</b> detection <b>system...</b>|$|R
