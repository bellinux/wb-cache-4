5|$|In December 2006, Aulie's {{father was}} using a tractor to clear <b>snow</b> <b>off</b> a frozen dugout in {{anticipation}} of an outdoor shinny game on New Year's Day. The ice could not support {{the weight of the}} tractor, and he fell through. Aulie was able to pull his father {{out of the water and}} get him to safety. The Canadian Red Cross honoured Aulie with their Rescuer Award for his act.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the harsh}} winter conditions, the station area was {{gradually}} built with snow tunnels {{to keep the}} <b>snow</b> <b>off</b> the tracks. This included the platforms {{and most of the}} passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station on the line. In 1948, {{the western part of the}} snow tunnel caught fire, and although it spread to the station building, it was quickly put out by the staff. In 1953, there was again a fire in the tunnel.|$|E
25|$|His {{father was}} a teamster, and {{struggled}} to earn enough money to support the family. In the winter, he ploughed the <b>snow</b> <b>off</b> outdoor skating rinks to earn additional money. Conacher left school after the eighth grade {{to go to work}} and help support his siblings. For ten hours a day, he hauled sod, earning an extra dollar a week for his family.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival, Collins {{decided to move}} the {{settlement}} to the far shore of the river. Surveyor George Harris was dispatched in a longboat, and within a day had reported back to Collins that he had located an excellent sheltered cove {{at the mouth of}} a fast flowing stream that seemed fed by the melted <b>snow</b> <b>off</b> Table Mountain (now Mount Wellington). He suggested the location would provide ample drinking water, whilst the cove would protect the ships from the current and weather. Most of the tents were struck two days later, and re-erected at Sullivans Cove on Monday, 20 February 1804. The following Sunday, 26 February 1804 the colony's chaplain, the Right Reverend Robert Knopwood, conducted the first divine service in Hobart Town.|$|E
25|$|Because it is {{situated}} in a fairly rural area, the UConn campus at Storrs has facilities that {{allow it to be}} virtually self-sufficient. All heat on campus is steam, and where possible sidewalks were laid over the underground connectors to keep the <b>snow</b> <b>off.</b> In 2005, a cogeneration plant was activated, which generates most of the electricity for the campus, and uses the exhaust steam for the campus central heating system. The university owns its own public water system and waste water treatment facility. With the support {{of a growing number of}} industry leaders based in Connecticut, UConn is at the forefront of developing clean, alternative sources of renewable energy using fuel cell technology. In April 2012, UConn commissioned a fuel cell power plant at its Depot Campus that will supply the campus with clean and efficiency energy, cooling and heating. The installation of a ClearEdge Power, former UTC Power, PureCell System is the latest step by UConn to reduce its carbon footprint and build a sustainable community. The fuel cell installation was made possible through a federal stimulus grant from Connecticut’s Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority.|$|E
500|$|Roy Conacher {{was born}} October 5, 1916, {{along with his}} twin brother Bert. They were the {{youngest}} children to Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher and two of ten siblings: five boys and five girls.

His father was a teamster, and struggled to earn enough money to support the family. In the winter, he ploughed the <b>snow</b> <b>off</b> outdoor skating rinks to earn additional money.|$|E

500|$|Several design {{innovations}} and {{new technologies}} {{were used for}} the 1960 Games. The speed skating, figure skating and ice hockey events were held on artificial ice {{for the first time in}} Olympic history. A refrigeration plant capable of heating 4,800 homes had to be built to generate and maintain the ice. The heat generated from the refrigeration plant was used to warm spectators, provide hot water, and melt the <b>snow</b> <b>off</b> of roofs. New timing equipment provided by Longines was installed that used a quartz clock to measure to the hundredths of a second. IBM provided a computer that was capable of tabulating results and printing them in English and French. Blyth Arena, site of the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the figure skating and ice hockey competitions, was built with a [...] gap in the roof, which would slide closed as the cables supporting the roof contracted during cold weather.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the unusually}} brutal winter of 2014–15, the entire MBTA system {{was shut down}} on several {{occasions}} by heavy snowfalls. The aboveground sections of the Orange and Red lines were particularly vulnerable due to their exposed third rail, which iced over during storms. When a single train stopped due to power loss, other trains soon stopped as well; without continually running trains pushing <b>snow</b> <b>off</b> the rails, the lines were quickly covered in snow. (Because the Blue Line was built with overhead lines on its surface section due to its proximity to corrosive salt air, it was not subject to icing issues.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Zeppelins {{encountered}} thick fog in the North Sea, {{followed by}} rain clouds and <b>snow</b> <b>off</b> the English coast, and the attacking force became dispersed; the nine airships crossed the English coast between 5:50pm and 7:20pm. The L 19 {{was the very}} last, crossing the coast near Sheringham. At 10:45pm, she reached Burton on Trent, becoming the third raider to attack the town that night. She then proceeded south, dropping the remainder of her bomb load on several towns {{on the outskirts of}} Birmingham. At 12:20am, a pub in Tipton was destroyed; buildings were also damaged in nearby Walsall and Birchills. She caused no casualties aside from some farm animals, although bombs dropped three hours earlier by her sister-ship, the L 21, killed 35 people in the area, including the wife of the Mayor of Walsall; a total of 61 people were reported killed and 101 injured by the raid. Due to the extreme difficulties of navigating with primitive equipment at night over a darkened countryside, the captain of the L 21 believed he had bombed Liverpool, in fact around [...] away.|$|E

Beginning what would quickly become a habit, he won the 1000cc class and continued winning that season. Although he rolled the car at Mallory Park in practice {{he was able to}} keep racing until money and impending engagement (to Carol) forced the sale of the Mini and absence from the tracks for a few months.
