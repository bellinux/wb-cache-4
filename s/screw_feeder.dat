40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>feeders</b> {{are being}} {{widely used in}} {{industry}} to feed reliably many kinds of bulk solids because of their simplicity in structure, good metering characteristics, total enclosure for safety, great flexibility of design and wide application. However, to date, the design {{of this type of}} equipment is still not precise due to an overall shortage theoretical analyses and experimental data reported in the literature. For this reason, this thesis aims at formulating theoretical models to predict the performance of single and twin <b>screw</b> <b>feeders.</b> The models concentrate on the volumetric efficiency, draw-down performance and torque or power requirement of <b>screw</b> <b>feeders.</b> The models are based on analyses of the relevant particulate mechanics. An element of bulk solid sliding on the helical surface of a screw flight will move in a direction related to the angle of friction between the bulk solid and the surface, and helical of the flight surface. An analytical solution to the integral equation to express the volumetric efficiency of <b>screw</b> <b>feeders</b> has been obtained. A theoretical model for the torque requirement is developed by analysing the stresses acting on the five confining surfaces surrounding the bulk solid contained within a pitch. This model allows the torque characteristics to be predicted. A criterion for uniform draw-down performance is presented based on the pitch characteristics of the screw. To obtain detailed information on the interaction among the screw geometry, the operating conditions and properties of the bulk solid, a systematic experimental investigation is undertaken into the performance of <b>screw</b> <b>feeders</b> with different <b>screw</b> and trough configurations, three types of bulk material and different operating conditions. Experimental programs on the twin <b>screw</b> <b>feeders</b> are also conducted to observe the effect of operating conditions and geometric parameters. The factors affecting performance of the twin <b>screw</b> <b>feeders</b> also are analysed. Experimental data are compared with the results obtained from the theoretical predictions. The volumetric efficiency, draw-down performance and torque requirements of <b>screw</b> <b>feeders</b> predicted by the theoretical models developed in this work are found to provide results which agree well with experimental data. The performance prediction models are also applied in industrial practice. Some typical problems experienced by industry are analysed.

The tests carried out produced satisfactory results, showing this system to be efficient and reliable.

40|$|Material {{handling}} {{is undoubtedly}} {{the most important}} and in fact an indispensable job in industries for it is encountered at every stage right from the time raw materials enter the factory gate to the point when it leaves in form of finished products. The engineering of material handling falls under two categories depending on form of material: bulk solid handling and unit handling. In case of handling lumpy materials like coals etc., feeder plays a vital role as an uninterrupted source of uniform feed provider to the conveyor system. Although several feeders like belt, apron, <b>screw,</b> <b>feeders</b> etc are available, reciprocating feeders are still in use because it ensures a continuous and controlled feed rate, is low in cost, its drive mechanism is simple, it can handle wide range of miscellaneous materials including lumps, easy in assembly and disassembly and maintenance requirement is quite low. The challenge which we have taken via the project, is to design a drive mechanism for a reciprocating coal feeder. We call it a challenge because we have to design various intricate components like couplings, worm reducers, gearbox etc. We call it complicated since all the components are interdependent on each other to a great extent. So we cannot design anything randomly. We have to take into considerations the smallest of small things like the various forces acting, how each component can fail under various stress conditions. We have to optimize everything right from the motor selection, to speed reduction ratio selection, to the capacity of coal which we can handle. We are going to follow the above-mentioned strategies so that our project does not remain just a theory but can become a reality for industries...|$|R

Therefore, research of micro machining and smart material {{is an important step}} to develop the future manufacturing process. Layered manufacturing is one of the propective process of it. Research of powder deposition is a key of developing multi material micro fabrication. This research was implemented in four steps including materials preparation and characterization, design and manufacturing experiment apparatus, wall friction-flow ability test and design-manufacturing MMMF machine including the mechanical, electronics and software system. The research was initiated by study observation to find information about characteristic of fine powder and method of reducing the cohesiveness. By sieving process, powder was separated into 4 particle sizes including - 34, 34 - 60, 60 - 74, 74 - 104 micron. Particle shapes were observed using optical microscope. Wall friction test was performed to observe the effect of wall surface roughness, particle size and material powder on mass flow characteristic, by Jenike method. Flow ability test was carried out to yield the powder flow consistency by varying the particle sizes, models of <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> geometry, installing blender mechanism, reducing the particle cohesiveness and the wall friction test parameters (powder quantity in hopper and wall surface roughness). For these experiments, rotation of the <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> was fixed at 236 rpm. By plotting the experimental data, the optimum parameter of powder mass flow can be determined and it was tested by varying rotation of the <b>screw</b> <b>feeder.</b> The experimental results show that the mass flow characteristic is affected by wall surface roughness and particle size. Effect of powder quantity in hopper can be eliminated by installing blender mechanism; it can also reduce the compaction of the powder around nozzle orifice so that the mass flow can be increase. Mass flow characteristic is also affected by hopper angle, in which the optimal angle is achieved at 25. 67 o (by variation of 20. 6 o, 22. 62 o and 25. 67 o). Powder mass flow was caused dominantly by stimulating rotation of the <b>screw</b> <b>feeder,</b> it is not by helicoidal surface of the <b>screw</b> <b>feeder.</b> Powders trapped in helicoidal slot drive around particle caused by geometric interlocking. However, increasing <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> diameter is an effective way to increase the mass flow of smaller particle size (in this chase smaller than 60 micron).

40|$|AbstractComposites of Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) and Graphene Nanoplatelets (GNPs) were {{processed}} using a {{twin screw}} extruder under different extrusion conditions. The effects of <b>screw</b> speed, <b>feeder</b> speed and GNP content on the electrical, thermal and mechanical properties of composites were investigated. The inclusion of GNPs in the matrix improved the thermal stability and conductivity by 2. 7 % and 43 %, respectively. The electrical conductivity improved from 10 − 11 to 10 − 5  S/m at 150  rpm {{due to the}} high thermal stability of the GNPs {{and the formation of}} phonon and charge carrier networks in the polymer matrix. Higher extruder speeds result in a better distribution of the GNPs in the matrix and a significant increase in thermal stability and thermal conductivity. However, this effect is not significant for the electrical conductivity and tensile strength. The addition of GNPs increased the viscosity of the polymer, which will lead to higher processing power requirements. Increasing the extruder speed led to a reduction in viscosity, which is due to thermal degradation and/or chain scission. Thus, while high speeds result in better dispersions, the speed needs to be optimized to prevent detrimental impacts on the properties...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Coal {{particles}} are supplied to {{drop tube furnace}} (DTF) with a designed shaftless <b>screw</b> micro <b>feeder.</b> The condition of individual particles in furnace, which demands small particles size (10 2 µm) and low flow rate for micro feeder，is desired to reaction mechanisms research. When particle size is less than 1 mm, the interparticle forces such as van der Waals interactions have enormous effect on flow behavior of particles, so {{it is difficult to}} provide continuous and steady particles flow at low flow rate. In this paper, the micro feeder uses shaftless spring as its feeding element. To simulate dispersed particles flow, the feeding rate of coal particles should be decided by feeding coefficient M and is controlled by variable rotation speed of screw. The corresponding simplified model of feeding rate is presented, and interparticle forces are evaluated by the velocity coefficient. A vibrating metal rod is inserted {{into the middle of the}} shaftless screw to avoid particles agglomeration, and particle flow stability is also effectively improved. The given results show good linearity and stability of micro feeder. Moreover, the influences of the particle properties such as particle size and particle moisture content on the feeding rate are also investigated...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a result of {{experimental}} studies carried out {{as a part of the}} efforts made in Sweden and within the European Union to develop a technology that will make it technically and economically possible to use biomass as a gas turbine fuel. The process that has been studied is based on cyclone gasification of biomass powder and no further cleaning of the product gas from the gasifier. The study covers four issues that are important for assessment of the possibilities to develop such a process to commercialisation: The feeding of biomass to the gasifier The efficiency of the gasification process The product gas quality The integration of the gas turbine and the gasifier. The studies of the feeding system are presented in papers 1, 2 and 3. <b>Screw</b> <b>feeders</b> were used to control the fuel flow and ejectors driven by pressurised air or pressurised steam were used for injection of the powder into the cyclone. Two approaches for achieving feeding with small temporal variations were studied. One is based on use of a vibrator device in the feeding train, the other on use of a brush-like device positioned after the metering screws. Both systems were found to work reliably during the feeding tests and the subsequent gasification experiments. The gasification tests aimed at determination of the quality of the gas produced from the cyclone gasifier. Stable operating ranges, generation of char residue, heating value of the product gas and amounts of contaminants in the product gas were studied. The results were compared with gas quality criteria provided by ABB Stal. Experiments were made at atmospheric pressure and elevated pressure. The atmospheric gasification tests covered five different biomass powders. The results of these tests are shown in paper 4. Two of the fuels appeared as less suitable in the type of cyclone gasifier that was used. The pressurised gasification tests included commercial Swedish wood powder fuel only. The results of the tests are shown in paper 5. For this fuel, stable gasification could be attained both at the atmospheric and elevated pressure. The gas quality fulfilled the criteria with exception for the amount of large particles (above 8 µm). The implications of this will depend on the particle properties. The experiences from attempts to operate the cyclone gasifier integrated with a gas turbine are presented in paper 6. Many difficulties where encountered during these tests. Stable operation of the gas turbine could be however achieved on a few occasions. The longest uninterrupted operation period was 34 minutes. Pressure transients appearing upon ignition in the combustion chamber of the gas turbine and design of the char discharge system at the cyclone bottom are the main unresolved problems.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Africa {{has one of}} {{the largest}} rates of poverty and famine. The hunger crisis in Africa is due to poverty as well as the little {{availability}} of nutritional food. Many locally grown crops are available in Africa but are not used to their fullest potential. There is a huge demand for proper food production methods. The food crops in Africa are still cooked in traditional methods by using wood and coal. This method of cooking produces food of very low quality and nutritional value. The reason for this is the over-cooking of food, breaking down proteins and other nutritional components. Extrusion is the process whereby high quality food is manufactured by using simple raw materials. Food extrusion is a process in which a food material is forced to flow, under one or more conditions of simultaneous mixing, heating and shearing, through a die, which is designed to form and/or puff-dry the ingredients. The main disadvantage of extruders available on the market today is the cost per unit. Extruders are currently manufactured in the USA, Europe and the Far East. These machines are very expensive and unaffordable for the African market. The first barrier to overcome is to find a high quality extruder that is affordable for the African economy. This dissertation will provide an introduction to extrusion technology and the application of an effective control system. Chapter 2 contains a literature study of the types of extruders available and discusses the different components of the extrusion process of the co-rotating twin-screw food extruder. The different needs and barriers for developing extrusion technology in developing countries will also be discussed. In Chapter 3 we will discuss the different components that form a control system and the various control modes that can be implemented to improve the control system, reduce offset and enhance stability.

The confirmation experiments reveal that the quality of the grate has been enhanced by decreasing the failures when the input parameters have been set in the optimum range.

40|$|A simple refiner control {{strategy}} aimed at minimizing variations in freeness of an ultra-high-yield sulfite (UHYS) pulp has been implemented in a newsprint mill. The <b>feeder</b> <b>screw</b> speed is being manipulated {{to compensate for}} variations in the bulk density of the chip feed and to maintain a constant motor load at the primary refiners. This ensures a more constant mass flow rate through the primary refiners, which translates into a more constant primary specific energy. This {{has resulted in a}} reduction in motor load fluctuations of about 60 % and a reduction in freeness variations of 40 %. The final pulp freeness is regulated by manipulating the plate gap of the secondary refiners using on-line freeness measurements made at the outlet of the latency chest. Control of the secondary plate gap has led to an additional 30 % reduction of the variation in freeness. This two-stage refining {{control strategy}} has reduced the 2 -sigma confidence interval for variation in pulp freeness from 48 mL to less than 14 mL, a reduction of more than 70 %. The complete strategy has reduced the average refiner energy consumption per ton of pulp by 3. 5 % and has increased the average paper machine production by 2. 5 % by reducing the number of paper breaks. In addition, the strategy has compensated for changes in cooking conditions and their effect on the refining properties of the chips...|$|R
