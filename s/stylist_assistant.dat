5000|$|Some schools {{now offer}} courses in {{becoming}} a wardrobe stylist, but of course, there are specific educational requirements for the position, such as having an artistic sense about which articles of clothing work {{together to make a}} beautiful look. Most stylists acquire these professional skills and knowledge by assisting other glamorous, established stylists, in a system similar to apprenticeship. Connections and experience are important. For example, after studying at the Rhode Island School of Design, celebrity stylist Elizabeth Sulcer apprenticed with British fashion designer Alexander McQueen for several years; later, she worked as fashion editor for BlackBook magazine where she hired intern LaQuan Smith, who soon established himself in New York as a leading clothing designer; later, as an established freelancer, she hires interns regularly. <b>Stylist</b> <b>assistants</b> are typically hired at a rate between $150 to $350 a day. Assistants' responsibilities can vary greatly depending on the stylist and the assignment. Some are hired only to perform physical labor, such as setting up for a client fitting or returning samples to a press showroom; others may help the stylist with selecting wardrobe options, preparing clients for public events, or any other task needed to complete an assignment. According to one report in Seventeen Magazine, there were no specific education majors helpful for becoming a fashion stylist, but that degrees in fashion design, tailoring, merchandising, communications, marketing, color harmonies, art history and photography, understanding of the human body - how it stores fat and ages, psychology and how women's perception changes to color, could be helpful, but overall it was helpful to read fashion magazines regularly to develop a [...] "great eye for fashion".|$|R

Mia is sharp and scheming and when her husband opens 'Blade Runners' for her, she uses every trick she can to try and bring Allie's salon down as revenge for her affair with Finn.|$|R
