50|$|The building’s {{interior}} {{was intended to}} be seen from the street as a public spectacle, which would reveal the university. The glass façade was to be <b>sand</b> <b>blasted</b> and seraphic printed to achieve patterning.The building was to be a contained public space.|$|E
40|$|Exposure data on {{biocides}} {{are relatively}} rare in published literature, especially for secondary exposure. This {{is also the}} case for antifouling exposure. Therefore, a field study was carried out measuring exposure to antifouling paints. Both primary exposure (rolling and spraying) and secondary exposure (during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting)</b> were studied. Exposure during rolling was measured in boatyards where paints containing dichlofluanid (DCF) were applied. Spraying was measured in dockyards (larger than boatyards) where paints containing copper were applied. Furthermore, during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> the removal of old paint layers containing copper was measured. A total of 54 datasets was collected, both for inhalation and dermal exposure data. For paint and stripped paint bulk analyses were performed. The following values are all arithmetic means of the datasets. Inhalation of copper amounted to 3 mg m- 3 during spraying and to 0. 8 mg m- 3 during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting.</b> Potential body exposure loading amounted to 272 mg h- 1 copper during spraying and 33 mg h- 1 during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting.</b> For dichlofluanid the inhalation exposure loading was 0. 14 mg m- 3 during rolling, whereas the potential body exposure loading was 267 mg h- 1 and potential hand exposure loading 277 mg h- 1. The results for primary exposure compare well to the very few public data available. For the secondary exposure (<b>sand</b> <b>blasting)</b> no comparable data were available. The present study shows that the exposure loading should be considered more extensively, including applicable protective gear. In this light the findings for the potmen during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> suggest that personal protective equipment should be (re) considered carefully. © The Author 2006.

40|$|Recently, wet <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> on coated {{cutting tool}} inserts has drawn {{interest}} to the tooling industry due to its positive effects on cutting performance and tool life. This performance boost has partly been attributed to the buildup of compressive residual stresses in the coating during the blasting process. However, the mechanism of forming residual stresses in ceramic coatings during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> is not fully understood. This work utilize x-ray diffraction as the main tool to study the formation and relaxation of residual stresses after wet <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> and annealing on 001, 012 and 110 textured α-Al 2 O 3 coatings. To minimize the influence of stress gradients in the samples, all stress measurements were set up with a fixed analysis depth of 2 µm. <b>Sand</b> <b>blasting</b> was made with an alumina based slurry at 2, 3. 2 and 4 bar pressure and the anneal was done at temperatures from 400 to 1000 °C for 2 hours or more. The coating hardness was evaluated by nanoindentation. Finally, the activation energy for the relaxation of residual stresses was estimated using the Zener-Wert-Avrami function. The results reveal the highest compressive residual stress with up to - 5. 3 GPa for the 012 texture while the stresses for the 001 and 110 textures peaked at - 3. 1 and - 2. 0 GPa, respectively. Further, a hardness gradient was present after blasting of the 001 and 012 textured samples indicating a higher stress at {{the surface of the}} coating. The 110 textured sample is the most brittle resulting in flaking of the coating during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting.</b> The different deformation mechanisms are related to difference in active slip planes between coatings with different textures. Both the stress and hardness decreased after heat treatment and the activation energy for stress relaxation was found to be as 1. 1 ± 0. 3 eV, 1. 9 ± 0. 2 eV and 1. 2 ± 0. 1 eV for the 001, 012 and 110 textures, respectively...|$|R
50|$|Ceramic {{fixtures}} {{are being}} more commonly glazed with 2 part epoxy compounds. The first component {{is a clear}} or opaque resin combined with a catalyst or hardener.

Since a true epoxy begins to yellow {{at the age of}} 1 year acrylic polyurethane compound is used in the topcoat.

The main headframe that is used at the Lapa mine was constructed almost entirely from a pre-existing headframe at LaRonde. The original headframe was dismantled, <b>sand</b> <b>blasted</b> and painted before it was installed at Lapa.

50|$|Because CO2 lasers {{operate in}} the infrared, special {{materials}} are necessary for their construction. Typically, the mirrors are silvered, while windows and lenses are made of either germanium or zinc selenide. For high power applications, gold mirrors and zinc selenide windows and lenses are preferred. There are also diamond windows and lenses in use. Diamond windows are extremely expensive, but their high thermal conductivity and hardness make them useful in high-power applications and in dirty environments. Optical elements made of diamond can even be <b>sand</b> <b>blasted</b> without losing their optical properties. Historically, lenses and windows were made out of salt (either sodium chloride or potassium chloride). While the material was inexpensive, the lenses and windows degraded slowly with exposure to atmospheric moisture.|$|E

50|$|Prior to 1900, {{the brick}} {{was left in}} its natural color and state, as it was unusually hard and held up well to the elements. (Unlike its sister, Big Sable Point Light, which was made from Cream City Brick, {{and had to be}} encased in steel {{boilerplate}} to retard the deterioration.) Having it in natural tones, however, was a boon to the Lighthouse keeper, who did not have to apply a yearly coat of whitewash. In 1900 the light was painted white for the first time, to assuage the complaints of mariners who said the brick was difficult to see. It remained that color until 1975, when it was <b>sand</b> <b>blasted,</b> and returned to its natural color. The lantern is capped by a copper roof.|$|E

5000|$|The {{surface of}} the {{formation}} has been eroded by the wind {{into a series of}} linear ridges called yardangs. [...] These ridges generally point in direction of the prevailing winds that carved them, and demonstrate the erosive power of martian winds. The easily eroded nature of the Medusae Fossae Formation suggests that it is composed of weakly cemented particles, and was most likely formed by the deposition of wind-blown dust or volcanic ash. Yardangs are parts of rock that have been <b>sand</b> <b>blasted</b> into long, skinny ridges by bouncing sand particles blowing in the wind. Layers are seen in parts of the formation. A resistant caprock on the top of yardangs has been observed in Viking, Mars Global Surveyor, and HiRISE photos. [...] Images from spacecraft show that they have different degrees of hardness probably because of significant variations in the physical properties, composition, particle size, and/or cementation. Very few impact craters are visible throughout the area so the surface is relatively young.|$|E

On the 6 October 1980 renovated building was the venue for an evening campfire in the park, attended by the Chief Scout of Australia Sir Zelman Cowan and Lady Cowan. By 1982 arrangements had been made with local firm, Rogers Fibreglass, to construct a giant scout hat that would fit over the roof of the building. It was lowered into place at a ceremony on 22 February 1982 with the Mayor of Cairns, Alderman Ron Davis officiating and has given the building a distinctive landmark quality.
