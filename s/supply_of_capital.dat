While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were considered fellow Protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the middle class, such as traditional financiers or other businessmen.

(In 1968, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad to form Penn Central Corp.) With the new owners came a more abundant <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> for geographic expansion and park additions. Six Flags opened Six Flags Over Georgia in 1967 and Six Flags Over Mid-America in 1971, which would, along with Six Flags Over Texas, be the only three parks that would be constructed by the company.|$|E

Secondly, a new era of an abundant <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> at low interest rates suddenly opened around this time. The second factor enabled the Company easily to finance its expansion in the new areas of commerce. Between the 1680s and 1720s, the VOC was therefore able to equip and man an appreciable expansion of its fleet, and acquire a large amount of precious metals to finance the purchase of large amounts of Asian commodities, for shipment to Europe. The overall effect was approximately to double the size of the company.|$|E

Using country- and industry-level data on OECD countries, we find R&D to be positively related to the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital.</b> There is, however, no indication that this translates into higher rates of SBTC, when SBTC is measured as changes in the wage bill share of skilled labor.

2500|$|In a May 2014 {{review of}} Piketty's book, the Marxist {{geographer}} David Harvey argued that capitalists nowadays {{drive up the}} industrial rate of profit by restricting the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> to new (productive) investment. For example, Chinese steel producers agreed to reduce steel production in response to overcapacity that emerged in 2015, and steel prices and profits are expected to rise significantly by 2018. The Argentinian scholar Esteban Ezequiel Maito, studying longterm trends in profitability, has argued that [...] "hen a proper definition of the matter in Marxian terms is done, Piketty's data itself confirms {{the law of the}} tendency of the rate of profit to fall". Economists like Odran Bonnet, Boe Thio, and Matthew Rognlie have argued that Piketty's results are largely attributable to his broad definition of capital, specifically to the growth in the value and profitability of the housing stock. Once the housing stock is excluded from capital data, Piketty's results no longer hold. Michael Hudson notes that if industrial profits are not statistically segregated from real estate profits, the overall rate of return on capital is [...] "considerably understated". Anwar Shaikh argues that Piketty's measure of capital is [...] "an inconsistent measure of real and financial assets", and that Piketty's [...] "hybrid definition of the rate of profits is invalid".|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} model of an economy with {{heterogeneous}} banks that may be funded with uninsured deposits and equity capital.

There is a fixed aggregate <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> bank <b>capital,</b> so the cost <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> is endogenous. A regulator sets risk-sensitive capital requirements in order to maximize a social welfare function that incorporates a social cost of bank failure. We consider the effect of a negative shock to the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> bank <b>capital</b> and show that optimal capital requirements should be lowered. Failure to do so would keep banks safer but produce a large reduction in aggregate investment.
