During the first 5 wk, all cows were managed on a restricted grazing regime with pasturing during the daytime and receiving a mixed ration of maize <b>silage,</b> <b>grass</b> hay, soybean expeller and a mineral mix during night-time. During the last 5 wk, all cows were indoors throughout the day and received a mixed ration containing grass silage, maize <b>silage,</b> <b>grass</b> hay, and concentrates. Cows were randomly allotted to one of two treatments: a control treatment with no supplementation and a “Gel” treatment supplementing WPEG at a rate of approximately 1. 5 kg/d per cow. Feed intake and milk production were monitored and samples of a. m. milking were analyzed for fat, protein, lactose and fatty acids. Supplementing WPEG had no significant effect on monitored dry matter intake (14 kg DM/d during restricted grazing — grass intake not determined; 21 kg DM/d during the last 5 -wk period). Supplementing WPEG had no effect on milk yield (average 35 kg/d) and on concentrations and yields of milk fat and milk protein. Supplementing WPEG increased lactose concentration. Supplementing WPEG decreased the proportions in milk of medium-chain fatty acids and increased the proportions of most C 18 fatty acids, except cis 9 C 18 : 1 and trans 10, cis 12 C 18 : 2. Supplementing WPEG led to doubling of cis 9, cis 12 C 18 : 2 (from 1. 8 to 4. 0 g/ 100 g of fatty acid) and a fourfold increase above control in cis 9, cis 12, cis 15 C 18 : 3 (from 0. 5 to 2. 2 g/ 100 g of fatty acids).

Therefore, this paper evaluates the effects of temperature and pH in anaerobic digestion of grass <b>silage.</b> <b>Grass</b> silage was digested in 1000 ml at different temperatures (35 ○C, 40 ○C, 45 ○C and 50 ○C) and pH (6. 5, 6. 8 & 7. 2). The digesters were shaken everyday to prevent the formation of surface crust which may prevent contact between microorganisms and the substrate. The characteristics of grass and cow dung and the optimal retention time are also reported. The results show that as the temperature was increased the biogas production and methane was also increased, however the high amount of biogas production rate and methane content was observed in the digester operated at 45 ○C and pH of 6. 5.

Grass clover silage was harvested in three maturity stages of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) that was a dominant grass in the sward: late vegetative (GS 1), internode elongation (GS 2) i and flowering (GS 3). Classical chemical analysis methods were used to analyse 16 samples of each of the maturity stage. Dry matter (DM) content of GS 1, GS 2 and GS 3 was 396, 408 and 463 g kg- 1 of the fresh sample, respectively, while crude protein (CP) content was 120, 98 and 90 g kg- 1 DM respectively.

We studied the effect of poultry manure, cattle slurry, sewage sludge, NH 4 NO 3 or urea on C cycling and sequestration in <b>silage</b> <b>grass</b> production. Soil respiration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and methane (CH 4) fluxes were measured with chambers, and soil samples were analysed for total C and dissolved organic C (DOC).

Organic fertilizer applications increased CO 2 loss through soil respiration but also enhanced soil C storage compared with mineral fertilizer. Cumulative soil respiration rates were highest in poultry manure treatments with 13. 7 t C ha− 1 in 2003, corresponding to 1. 6 times the control value, but no residual effect was seen.

The minisilos were opened at 46 days to evaluate silage crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), total digestible nutrients (TDN), ammonia nitrogen, lignin, and pH. We observed significant interaction between system and age on the variables CP, ADF, NDF, lignin and pH. With the advancement of age, there was a linear reduction in crude protein content of 0. 12, 0. 08, and 0. 16 percentage units for each day after sowing in sorghum silage, sorghum grass and grass + Piata, respectively.

Fallow deer impact on first-cut <b>silage</b> <b>grass</b> production was similarly measured using exclosure cages at a second site by cutting samples on 31 May 1990 and on 6 June 1995. In addition, impact of fallow deer on cereal crops was assessed at this site by measuring sample grain yields from areas of the crop used or unused by deer in 1995 (winter wheat), 1996 (winter barley) and 1997 (winter wheat). Significant dry matter yield losses were recorded for red deer impact on spring grazing in 1989 (14. 5 %) and for fallow deer impact on first-cut silage (15. 9 %) in 1995 but not in 1990. In 1995 a small but significant yield loss (7. 1 %) was recorded for winter wheat at the fallow deer site but no loss in cereal yield was recorded in 1996 or 1997. These assessments, carried out in response to complaints about deer damage, suggest that the impacts of deer in this area, where they occur at relatively high density, are only moderate.

40|$|Maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> are {{commonly}} used as major feed materials for dairy cows in Europe and are becoming common parts of dairy cow rations {{in other parts of}} the world. Thenutritive value of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> varies greatly due to variation in chemical composition. A combination of different factors such as the use of various cultivars, fertilization practices, growing conditions, harvesting technology, maturity at harvest and ensiling conditions cause this variation in chemical composition. The first aim of this thesis was to investigate relationships between the chemical composition and the in situ rumen degradation characteristics and in situ mobile nylon bag digestibility of dietary nutrients of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> Maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> with a broad range in chemical composition and quality parameters were selected from different Dutch commercial farms. The broad range in the chemical composition of the maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> resulted in a large variation in rumen degradable fractions of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and starch. The intestinal digestibility of CP, NDF and/or starch was affected by the concentration of these components in the maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages,</b> by the rumen incubation time and the rumen escape content. Regression equations were developed describing relationships between the chemical composition and the in situ ruminal and postruminal degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> A number of the developed regression equations presented in this thesis can be used for accurate and rapid estimation of the ruminal and postruminal degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages,</b> without conducting time consuming and expensive in situ experiments. The second aim of this thesis was to determine whether three cows are sufficient to cover the variation between individual cows in in situ rumen degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> Significant differences (P 0. 05) between individual cows were found for all the parameters of DM, OM, CP and NDF. The results suggest that using three cows are sufficient for nylon bag incubations of <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> and pooling of rumen incubated residues is allowed to obtain a representative sample. The third aim of this thesis was to compare two fractionation methods; the washing machine method and a modified method, for nitrogen (N) and starch fractions of maize silages and N fractions of <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> The N and/or starch fractions of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> determined, using the washing machine method (washing with water for 40 min) and the modified method (shaking with buffer solution for 60 min) were compared. The different methodological approaches of both methods resulted in different values for the washout (W), the soluble (S) and the non-washout (D+U) fractions of N of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> and for the W, the insoluble washout (W-S) and the D+U fractions of starch of maize silages. The loss of insoluble small particles of starch was less during shaking of nylon bags in buffer solution, compared to washing nylon bags in the washing machine. Therefore, large differences were found between the D+U fractions of starch determined by both methods compared to the D+U fractions of N of maize silages. The developed regression equations for W, S and D+U fractions of N in <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> and for D+U fractions of starch in maize silages determined by both methods can be used for rapid estimation of these fractions from chemical characteristics of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> The information on nutrient bioavailability of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> presented in this thesis can be used to more accurately formulate dairy ration in terms of maintenance, health and production of dairy cows...|$|R

Three cows were used for nylon bag incubation of maize silages and three other cows for <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> The variation between individual cows was found significant (P 0. 05) differences were found for all other parameters of DM, OM, CP, starch and NDF. The variation between individual cows was found non-significant (P > 0. 05) for rumen undegradable fraction (U), potentially rumen degradable fraction (D), k d and ED of DM, OM, CP and NDF of <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> The results of this study indicate that the use of three cows for nylon bag incubations of <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> is sufficient whereas the use of three cows for nylon bag incubations of maize silages is not sufficient to cover variation between the individual cows. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate interaction effects between stage of maturity and N fertilization rate on rumen degradation characteristics determined with nylon bag incubations of ryegrass herbages and ryegrass <b>silage.</b> <b>Grass</b> herbage (n = 4) was cut after 3 or 5 weeks of regrowth and received a low (20 kg N/ha) or a high (90 kg N/ha) fertilization rate. Grass silage (n = 6) received a low (65 kg N/ha) or high (150 kg N/ha) fertilization rate and was harvested at early (c 2000 kg DM/ha), mid (harvested 13 d later), or late (harvested 34 d later) maturity stage and ensiled in big bales. All grasses were incubated in the rumen of three lactating rumen-cannulated Holstein Friesian cows. Rumen degradation characteristics of organic matter (OM), nitrogen (N) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) {{and the extent of}} effective degradation (ED) were evaluated. In grass herbage, NDF content varied between 390 and 454 g/kg DM and N content between 12. 1 and 25. 8 g/kg DM. In grass silage, NDF content varied between 438 and 593 g/kg DM and N content between 13. 4 and 34. 8 g/kg DM. In general, rumen degradation of grass herbage and grass silage decreased with increased maturity, and increased with increased fertilization rate. Significant interaction between maturity and fertilization rate was observed for ED of OM, N and NDF, except for ED of N in grass herbage. These results indicate that the effect of the rate of N fertilization on degradation of nutrients in the rumen of dairy cattle and on nutritional value depends on the grass maturity stage...|$|E
40|$|Milk fever in {{dairy cows}} can be {{prevented}} by activating Ca homeostasis before calving. Homeostatic adaptation {{can be achieved by}} reducing dietary Ca availability. Formaldehyde-treated rice bran was studied to supply rumen protected phytic acid to reduce Ca availability. Twelve multiparous dry cows were used in a 3 × 3 Latin square change-over design with 5 -day periods to test three dietary treatments. Diets consisted of a forage mix (maize <b>silage,</b> <b>grass</b> silage and hay), being 77 % of ration dry matter, supplemented with three concentrates: Control (no formaldehyde-treated rice bran), T 1 (100 % formaldehyde-treated rice bran) and T 2 (99. 5 % formaldehyde-treated rice bran with 0. 6 % Ca carbonate, to equal Ca content of Control). Dietary treatments did not affect urine pH (8. 14, 8. 13 and 8. 11 for Control, T 1 and T 2 respectively) or dry matter intake (13. 9, 13. 7 and 13. 8 kg for Control, T 1 and T 2 respectively). Including formaldehyde-treated rice bran in the diet resulted in lower urinary Ca/creatinine ratio (0. 970, 0. 457 and 0. 618 for Control, T 1 and T 2 respectively). A sudden increase of urinary Ca excretion took place after withdrawal of T 1 and T 2 at introduction of Control, peaking on the first day and coming back down progressively {{in the second and third}} days. Peak was greatest after T 1 and was not observed in transitions between rice bran treatments. This is understood as indirect evidence of activation of intestinal Ca absorption during formaldehyde-treated rice bran feeding, because renal adaptations to changes in blood Ca clearance are immediate and intestinal adaptations delay 2 days. It was concluded that including formaldehyde-treated rice bran in rations before calving may represent a dietary strategy to prevent milk fever without reducing dry matter intak...|$|E
40|$|An {{in vitro}} study was {{conducted}} to investigate effects of inoculum source (i. e., sheep versus buffalo rumen fluid) on gas production profiles, and to evaluate the suitability of various mathematical equations to fit the profiles and provide accurate values of degradation attributes. Incubations were completed using ruminal fluid obtained from sheep or buffalos fed the same diet (600 g/kg grass hay and 400 g/kg concentrate). Kinetics of fermentation of five feeds commonly fed to ruminants, being maize <b>silage,</b> <b>grass</b> silage, wheat straw, barley grain and a mixed hay, were studied with a gas production technique using an automated pressure evaluation system (APES). Ruminal fermentation characteristics (i. e., substrate disappearance, pH and VFA production) were determined after 120 h of incubation. Five mathematical functions (i. e., exponential, France, Gompertz, logistic, Morgan) were fitted to the experimental data to estimate rate and extent of feed degradation. Model comparison was based on goodness-of-fit assessed from analysis of residual variance and Akaike’s information criterion. The logistic and Morgan functions were best overall, although the goodness-of-fit attained with all models was considered acceptable. Except for the Morgan, there were small differences among models in values derived for extent of degradation. There were differences between sources of inoculum in gas production measured at intermediate times (i. e., gas volumes with buffalo rumen fluid of 133 and 164 ml/g organic matter (OM) at 24 h for grass hay and silage, respectively, were smaller than those with sheep rumen fluid of 182 and 208 ml/g OM), but not at earlier or later incubation times. As a result of this trend, shorter half times, faster fermentation rates and higher extents of degradation occurred when feeds were incubated in sheep (estimated OM degradability was 0. 308 and 0. 402 g/g OM for grass hay and silage, respectively) compared with buffalo rumen fluid (0. 246 and 0. 330 g/g OM). Differences were larger for more fibrous substrates (i. e., grass silage, straw and hay) and negligible for barley grain...|$|E

40|$|The aim of our {{experiment}} {{was to compare}} the effect of feeding inorganic and organic forms of zinc in premix on the coefficient of digestibility of nutrients in the feeding ration for cows in three stages of reproductive cycle – 14 d before calving and 30 and 60 d after calving. The {{experiment was}} carried out on 19 Holstein cows that {{were divided into two}} groups. A control group of nine cows designated as “Inorganic zinc form” (IZF) was fed a diet supplemented with mineral premix containing inorganic form of zinc (ZnO). An experimental group of ten cows designated as “Organic zinc form” (OZF) had zinc oxide replaced with zinc fixed to methionine (Khei-chelate Zn powder 15 % by Kheiron). The experiment was divided into three periods - the first period lasted from 14 th day before calving until 2 nd day after calving, the second period lasted from 3 rd day to 30 th day after calving and the third period lasted from 31 st day to 60 th day after calving. Cows were fed the diet based on maize silage, lucerne haylage, sugar beet pulp <b>silage,</b> <b>grass</b> or lucerne hay and concentrate containing premix with either inorganic or organic zinc form. During the experiment samples of feeding ration and faeces were taken in 3 intervals, it si on 14 th day before calving, on 30 th day and on 60 th day after calving to determine nutrients content. Digestibility of nutrients was calculated using indicator method (ash insoluble in 3 [*]M HCl). After feeding organic forms of zinc a tendency to higher digestibility of crude protein, fat, crude fiber, nitrogen-free extracts, ash and zinc was observed in cows regardless of stage of reproductive cycle. The digestibility of the zinc and fiber were the most increased. Digestibility of zinc in OZF on 14 th day before calving was higher than in IZF (P < 0. 05). Feeding of organic zinc forms had downward effect only on the digestibility of copper...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} and function of the microbiome inhabiting the rumen are, amongst other factors, mainly shaped by the animal's feed intake. Describing the influence of different diets on the inherent community arrangement and associated metabolic activities {{of the most active}} ruminal fractions (bacteria and archaea) is of great interest for animal nutrition, biotechnology, and climatology. Samples were obtained from three fistulated Jersey cows rotationally fed with corn <b>silage,</b> <b>grass</b> silage or grass hay, each supplemented with a concentrate mixture. Samples were fractionated into ruminal fluid, particle-associated rumen liquid, and solid matter. DNA, proteins and metabolites were analyzed subsequently. DNA extracts were used for Illumina sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene and the metabolomes of rumen fluids were determined by 500 MHz-NMR spectroscopy. Tryptic peptides derived from protein extracts were measured by LC-ESI-MS/MS and spectra were processed by a two-step database search for quantitative metaproteome characterization. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD 006070. Protein- and DNA-based datasets revealed significant differences between sample fractions and diets and affirmed similar trends concerning shifts in phylogenetic composition. Ribosomal genes and proteins belonging to the phylum of Proteobacteria, particularly Succinivibrionaceae, exhibited a higher abundance in corn silage-based samples while fiber-degraders of the Lachnospiraceae family emerged in great quantities throughout the solid phase fractions. The analysis of 8163 quantified bacterial proteins revealed the presence of 166 carbohydrate active enzymes in varying abundance. Cellulosome affiliated proteins were less expressed in the grass silage, glycoside hydrolases appeared in slightest numbers in the corn silage. Most expressed glycoside hydrolases belonged to families 57 and 2. Enzymes analogous to ABC transporters for amino acids and monosaccharides were more abundant in the corn silage whereas oligosaccharide transporters showed a higher abundance in the fiber-rich diets. Proteins involved in carbon metabolism were detected in high numbers and identification of metabolites like short-chain fatty acids, methylamines and phenylpropionate by NMR enabled linkage between producers and products.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether the supply of <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> or <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> mixed with barley or CCM to organically raised gestating sows would allow a reduction of compound feed allowance without loss in animal performance. On average, sows fed <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> or mixed silage were able to compensate for a pre-set reduction of 1 kg or 1. 5 kg compound feed, respectively. However, the variation in silage intake between individual sows was large, with a number of mainly young sows consuming less silage than the required amount. Consequently, these sows showed a net back fat loss during the experimental period from d 7 of gestation to weaning. Our results indicate that more feeder space than 1 for 8 sows is required to allow adequate silage intake in group housed sows. From this study we cannot derive whether that would be also allow young sows to realise an adequate silage intake.
