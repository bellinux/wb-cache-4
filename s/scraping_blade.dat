50|$|Tissue {{machines}} typically {{form the}} paper web between a wire {{and a special}} fabric (felt) as they wrap around a forming roll. The web is pressed from the felt directly onto a large diameter dryer called a yankee. The paper sticks to the yankee dryer and is peeled off with a <b>scraping</b> <b>blade</b> called a doctor. Tissue machines operate at speeds of up to 2000 m/min.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A special {{designed}} dual-spindle tool was assembled {{on the end}} of a Cartesian robot for {{purpose of}} cleaning up mounting holes of carbon anodes used in aluminum electrolytic production. Spiral grooves distributed around inner wall of the mounting holes lead to force compliance issues during cleaning process. Decomposing the task space into force and position control directions, the compliance movement of the scraping tools was accomplished based on hybrid force-position method. Fuzzy strategy combining with conventional PI controller was utilized to perform torque control of <b>scraping</b> <b>blades</b> of the cleaning tool while the environment stiffness is uncertain. The control algorithm was realized in a programmable logic controller based on look-up table of fuzzy rules. Cleaning tests in actual production line were also performed that indicated the validity of the force compliance controller...|$|R

5000|$|Tsui no Hiken: Kaguzuchi (lit. [...] "Final Secret Sword: Fire-Producing Spirit God"): The Kaguzuchi is the {{ultimate}} technique in Shishio's arsenal. He activates it by <b>scraping</b> his <b>blade</b> from the base to the tip {{on the end of}} the scabbard, creating a miniature fire cyclone around the blade. The technique is not fully revealed, but it is believed that Shishio starts the fire and then slashes at the enemy, thus he can incinerate them entirely while still cutting them. Before Shishio could utilize the Kaguzuchi, he was countered by Kenshin's ultimate attack-Amakakeru Ryu no Hirameki. The Kaguzuchi is the name of the Shinto god of fire.|$|R

40|$|Transverse {{sections}} and abaxial epidermal <b>scrapes</b> of leaf <b>blades</b> of Pentameris dregeana Stapf, both of herbarium specimens and of freshly fixed material, were examined by light microscopy. The anatomical structure {{was found to}} be basically uniform in a representative sample. A few somewhat atypical specimens, how'ever, showed epidermal similarities with  Pentaschistis colorata (Steud.) Stapf. A comparison with other danthonoid grasses revealed some specimens identified as  Pentaschistis colorata var.   polytricha Stapf which resemble  Pentameris dregeana very closely in leaf anatomy. A definite gradation in leaf anatomy between  Pentameris dregeana and  Penta­schistis colorata appears to exist and. consequently, it is proposed that the affinities of Pentameris dregeana lie with this group of  Pentaschistis species rather than close to any of the other  Pentameris species. </p...|$|R

Then {{there was a}} lunge and a sharp nerve-tingling <b>scrape</b> as one <b>blade</b> ran along the other; and then, without a groan, down fell one of these brave warriors flat upon his back upon the grass, the wild flowers, and bits of bark. Instantly the impulses of a woman flashed through every vein and nerve of that onlooking girl. Scarcely had the tall form of the soldier touched the sod when she became a nurse. Springing out from her leafy concealment, she knelt beside the vanquished form of the fallen man. The other soldier, who was about to rest himself by leaning on his sword, sprang back; it seemed as though there had suddenly appeared before him a being from another world." ...|$|R
40|$|Absolute, precise {{quantification}} methods {{expand the}} scope of nucleic acids research and have many practical applications. Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is a powerful method for nucleic acid detection and absolute quantification. However, it requires thermal cycling and accurate temperature control, which are difficult in resource-limited conditions. Accordingly, isothermal methods, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), are more attractive. We developed a picoliter well array (PWA) chip with 27, 000 consistently sized picoliter reactions (314 pL) for isothermal DNA quantification using digital RPA (dRPA) at 39 °C. Sample loading using a <b>scraping</b> liquid <b>blade</b> was simple, fast, and required small reagent volumes (i. e., < 20 μL). Passivating the chip surface using a methoxy-PEG-silane agent effectively eliminated cross-contamination during dRPA. Our creative optical design enabled wide-field fluorescence imaging in situ and both end-point and real-time analyses of picoliter wells in a 6 -cm(2) area. It was not necessary to use scan shooting and stitch serial small images together. Using this method, we quantified serial dilutions of a Listeria monocytogenes gDNA stock solution from 9 × 10 (- 1) to 4 × 10 (- 3) copies per well with an average error of less than 11 % (N = 15). Overall dRPA-on-chip processing required less than 30 min, which was a 4 -fold decrease compared to dPCR, requiring approximately 2 h. dRPA on the PWA chip provides a simple and highly sensitive method to quantify nucleic acids without thermal cycling or precise micropump/microvalve control. It has applications in fast field analysis and critical clinical diagnostics under resource-limited settings...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} cannabis/methaqualone/tobacco smoking on the {{epithelial}} {{cells of the}} tongue, buccal mucosa and floor of the mouth were examined. Oral mucosal smears for detection of cellular changes were taken from 4 sites in 16 patients. The tongue <b>blade</b> <b>scraping</b> technique was used. The sites sampled included the buccal mucosa (left and right sides), the posterior dorsum of the tongue and the anterior floor of the mouth. Tobacco smoking and non-smoking controls were also examined. The only significant difference between cannabis users and controls was the greater prevalence of bacterial cells in the smears taken from cannabis users. However, there were also greater numbers of degenerate and atypical squamous cells in cannabis smokers than in cigarette-smoking and non-smoking controls. Epithelial cells in smears taken from cannabis users and tobacco-smoking controls also showed koilocytic changes, which were not seen in smears taken from non-smoking controls. Koilocytosis is indicative of human papilloma virus infection, although no apparent lesions were seen in the patients from whom smears had been taken. It would appear {{that there is a}} greater tendency towards damaged and immature surface epithelial cells in cannabis smokers. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Basal cell {{carcinoma}} (BCC) {{is the most}} common cancer of the skin. Definite diagnosis usually requires histological examination but recently {{it has been suggested that}} cytological examination of skin smear can be used as an alternative. To evaluate sensitivity and specificity of cytological examination, a total of 125 skin lesions, clinically suspected to be BCC were studied. Cytological samples were taken by <b>scraping</b> a scalpel <b>blade</b> over the lesion and smearing the cells on to a glass slide. The specimens were air- dried and stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa. An incision biopsy was performed for histopathological study. The cytological results were compared with the histopathological results of the lesions. Histopathology revealed BCC in 102 lesions (81. 6 %), squamous {{cell carcinoma}} (SCC) in 11 lesions (8. 8 %), seborrheic keratosis in 6 lesions (4. 8 %), actinic keratosis in 5 lesions (4 %) and keratoacanthoma in 1 lesion (0. 8 %). Cytological examination reported BCC in 90 (72 %), SCC in 13 (10. 4 %) and seborrheic keratosis in 6 lesions (4. 8 %) and was non-diagnostic in 16 lesions (12. 8 %). The sensitivity and specificity of the cytology in identifying all of the BCC types were 87. 3 % and 95. 3 %, respectively. In conclusion, cytological examination is easy to perform, saves time, requires a minimum of equipments and can be considered a reliable method in the diagnosis of suspected cutaneous BCC...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{etiologic}} role of Malassezia furfur in onychomycosis, {{because of}} its controversial keratinolytic ability, has not been proven. The most reported cases are distal subungual onychomycosis (DSO). In our knowledge no cases of proximal onychomycosis (PO) has been reported. For {{the first time we}} report proximal onychomycosis. This case report describes the isolation of Malassezia furfur from fingernails. Case presentation: An Iranian 56 - year- old women had been referred to mycology lab with hyperkeratosis in proximal regions of right hand nails and clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis without paronychia in May 2012. She used several medicines for her cardiac disease, mental illness, severe stress and blood glucose fluctuation diseases. Scraping and sampling from nail lesions were done, budding yeast cells with broadband connections were observed in 15 % KOH wet mounts. Also, other differentiation tests, consist of staining with methylen blue, cultures and biochemical tests were done. In order to rejecting the probable etiologic role of any dermatophytic or non-dermatophytic fungi in this case, samples were collected {{from other parts of the}} body by scotch tape and <b>scraping</b> with scalpel <b>blade</b> too, but the results of direct microscopy and culture were negative. Finally, Malassezia furfur was identified as the causative agent of onychomycosis. Conclusion: Despite failure to prove Malassezia furfur keratinolytic ability, it can be the etiologic agent of proximal onychomycosis that shows the aggressive properties of this species. Its clinical importance is the easier transmission to hospitalized patients and other people...|$|R

5000|$|Almost all blades are decorated, {{although}} not all blades are decorated on the visible part of the blade. Once the blade is cool, and the mud is <b>scraped</b> off, the <b>blade</b> has designs and grooves cut into it. One {{of the most important}} markings on the sword is performed here: the file markings. These are cut into the tang (nakago), or the hilt-section of the blade, during shaping, where they will be covered by a tsuka or hilt later. The tang is never supposed to be cleaned: doing this can cut the value of the sword in half or more. The purpose is to show how well the blade steel ages. A number of different types of file markings are used, including horizontal, slanted, and checked, known as ichi-monji, ko-sujikai, sujikai, ō-sujikai, katte-agari, shinogi-kiri-sujikai, taka-no-ha, and gyaku-taka-no-ha. A grid of marks, from raking the file diagonally both ways across the tang, is called higaki, whereas specialized [...] "full dress" [...] file marks are called kesho-yasuri. Lastly, if the blade is very old, it may have been shaved instead of filed. This is called sensuki. While ornamental, these file marks also serve the purpose of providing an uneven surface which bites well into the hilt which fits over it, and is made from wood. It is this pressure fit for the most part that holds the hilt in place, while the mekugi pin serves as a secondary method and a safety.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental investigation of tip clearance flow in a radial inflow turbine. Flow visualisation and static pressure measurements were performed. These were combined with hot-wire traverses into the tip gap. The experimental data {{indicates that the}} tip clearance flow in a radial turbine {{can be divided into}} three regions. The first region is located at the rotor inlet, where the influence of relative casing motion dominates the flow over the tip. The second region is located towards midchord, where the effect of relative casing motion is weakened. Finally a third region exists in the exducer, where the effect of relative casing motion becomes small and the leakage flow resembles the tip flow behaviour in an axial turbine. Integration of the velocity profiles showed that there is little tip leakage {{in the first part of}} the rotor because of the effect of scraping. It was found that the bulk of tip leakage flow in a radial turbine passes through the exducer. The mass flow rate, measured at four chordwise positions, was compared with a standard axial turbine tip leakage model. The result revealed the need for a model suited to radial turbines. The hot-wire measurements also indicated a higher tip gap loss in the exducer of the radial turbine. This explains why the stage efficiency of a radial inflow turbine is more affected by increasing the radial clearance than by increasing the axial clearance.
