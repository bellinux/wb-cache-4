40|$|Italy is the nation, in Europe and {{the rest}} of the world, with the {{greatest}} tradition and experience in the construction and management of motorway infrastructure financed through the tolling system. Accordingly, our country has faced many of the problems and issues that are today of current interest in the European Community well before other countries have, availing itself of professional help both from the motorway sector as well as from the academic one. This professional help is not only based on abstract theories but rather on experience that has been acquired on the field. It thus seems only natural that Aiscat, in representation of the operators of the Italian motorway network in concession, should have commissioned a report on the external costs of transport, a subject which, further to its inclusion in European directive no. 2006 / 38, and the deadlines set by the European Parliament, has become of current interest; no longer therefore only a matter of academic discussion, but rather an important element and parameter of assessment for European Transport Policy. Although representing the motorway sector, Aiscat has taken into consideration the valuable indications provided by the European Authorities concerning the need of not limiting the analysis to external costs vis-à-vis individual modes of transport but rather coherently analyse these modes in terms of mobility and transport as a whole. Based on the above understanding and approach, this report has been prepared with the support of Prometeia- a highly qualified research and consulting firm-, and the contribution of export researchers whose background and <b>skills</b> <b>guarantee</b> the rigour and depth of analysis that were the key to this work from the very outset. I am therefore pleased and honoured to make this report available to all those who shall take part in establishing a common position on the subject, and trust that this contribution may help deal with all open issues in an analytical and rigorous manner, as should rightly be expected for all projects destined to affect the future of Europe and its people...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{pervasiveness of}} cell phones among young people has made them an ideal {{platform}} to cater educational content informally (anywhere, anytime). Although there are {{a large number of}} mobile learning tools, educational games provide an adequate compromise between educational content and games that makes the informal educational exploration more enjoyable and engaging. However, most educational games for cell phones are created by software developers as complex software packages which require software engineering knowledge to be modified or customized as needed. In this paper, we propose a system where games are created by game designers and educational contents by teachers, and both are brought together in a seamless manner. This novel approach facilitates the use of educational games without the need of programming <b>skills</b> and <b>guarantees</b> that teachers can easily create the educational contents that go into the mobile games...|$|R

40|$|Separating {{the people}} from the problem assumes an individualist value set {{underlying}} the Western approach to investigation. In collectivist cultures, where relationships prevail over tasks, this is an almost impossible demand. Effective investigation for aviation accidents within different cultural contexts demands insight into the range of cultural values to be expected among partners from other countries, in addition to an awareness of the investigator’s own culturally determined values. Effective international investigations also demand language and communication <b>skills</b> to <b>guarantee</b> that the messages sent to the other professional investigators from different cultures with different approaches to accident investigation will be understood in the way they were meant to be. The global interaction between different cultures involves sharing the values of all partners.

The cognitive orientation and mechanisms of Eastern and Western cultures are sufficiently different that they may draw completely different inferences from the same set of data (as in this case), especially in the case where human factors are concerned. The best approach may be to try to understand the events in the accident from the viewpoint of the culture of the pilots/airline involved in the accident and not from the cultural viewpoint of the investigator. This way there might be a better chance that culturally congruent remedial actions can be proposed. However, by better understanding these cultural differences it seems highly likely that they can only serve to complement and enrich each other...|$|R

40|$|Background In {{the period}} of middle childhood, social {{experiences}} (both educational and social) may constitute a critical moment {{in time for the}} ultimate results of development {{in the case of an}} individual. Negative life events and coping <b>skills</b> may <b>guarantee</b> a positive or negative direction of development, exerting an influence on the mental health of children. In the study, a four-factor model of mental health was adopted, taking into consideration psychopathological symptoms within the scope of externalizing and internalizing disorders, the level of the performance of developmental tasks, and the sense of life satisfaction. The present study investigated the correlation between stress, coping and mental health in children in middle childhood. Participants and procedure The study included 182 individuals aged between 9 and 12 years. The following aspects were subjected to assessment: the level of mental health, the number and severity of negative life events, and the strategies of coping with stress. In order to determine the strongest predictors of the four dimensions of mental health of children, hierarchical regression analysis was applied. Results It was found that the strongest predictor of mental health of children in {{the period of}} middle childhood was individual and accumulated negative stress events. Lower significance was found for the subjective assessment of the severity of events being experienced. It was found that a factor protecting against disorders was active methods of coping. Conclusions The study suggests that it is not only psychopathological symptoms that constitute the negative consequence of the effect of stress. Negative stress events influence the positive dimensions of mental health, including the level of performance of developmental tasks and the sense of life satisfaction in children in the period of middle childhood. The obtained results show the specific character of the discussed period of development. However, these issues still need to be explored further...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Since the {{management}} revolution {{highlighted by the}} theories of Frederick Winslow and Henry Fayol, plenty of global changes have occurred. Competitiveness has become the major factor to determine {{the economic and social}} power represented by companies and nations. The basic aim of the research to be outlined was to reveal the significance of real and information process analysis of operating controlling systems introduced in domestic entrepreneurial practice, and also to present the features commonly shared by enterprises as well as those that can be considered unique. 1 A summary of the Aim of the Research The sphere of activity available for company management is determined by the ever-increasing competition, changing realization and buying markets and the tight possibilities of potential applications. The art of company management lies in the <b>skills</b> to <b>guarantee</b> that the company may persist and sustain its viability. Ever since market economy came into being Hungarian companies have been forced to continually utilise their resources rationally. Controlling is proven to be an efficient method, which is to provide key information for the company management at the right moment, concerning the status of environment and inside processes. No controlling organisations and functions can be separated from real processes, the controlling system is always established by the given company and its environment. Controlling systems and applying merely its function (e. g. with small or medium-size enterprises) have a general feature. The general features of controlling systems are independent of external and internal factors, special features of the controlling systems being specified by the latter. For the last 15 years the author of this thesis has been bent on defining the concept of controlling and controlling system as well as revealing its specific features, which means either linking one company function to controlling (e. g. logistics) or differentiation resulted by external and internal factors influencing the operation of the company...|$|R

40|$|The study {{described}} in this dissertation assesses the socio-economic impact of participation in literacy programs on women in rural Mali, and examines {{the interaction between the}} culture of formal instruction that characterized the literacy classes and traditional culture. The study used qualitative and quantitative methods to collect data over a nine-month period in four villages. Methods included household observation, interview, observation of literacy classes, and administration of a test of literacy skills and a questionnaire of socio-economic attitudes and practices. The study found that lives of literate women in the communities studied differed little from those of their nonliterate counterparts. Despite the presence of literacy programs in the villages, it was difficult for women to become literate, and women who had obtained literacy skills rarely used them. The author argues that subtle ideological forces in the communities made it very difficult for literacy to bring about socio-economic change in women 2 ̆ 7 s lives. Rather, 2 ̆ 2 women 2 ̆ 7 s literacy 2 ̆ 2 had been appropriated into the prevailing male-dominant socio-political culture.

40|$|Abstract. Reading {{requires}} two related, but separable, capabilities: (1) {{familiarity with}} a language, and (2) understanding the mapping between that {{language and the}} printed word (Chamberlain & Mayberry, 2000; Hoover & Gough, 1990). Children who are profoundly deaf are disadvantaged on both counts. Not surprisingly, then, reading is difficult for profoundly deaf children. But some deaf children do manage to read fluently. How? Are they simply the smartest of the crop, or do they have some strategy, or circumstance, that facilitates linking the written code with language? A priori one might guess that knowing American Sign Language (ASL) would interfere with learning to read English simply because ASL does not map in any systematic way onto English. However, recent {{research has suggested that}} individuals with good signing skills are not worse, and may even be better, readers than individuals with poor signing skills (Chamberlain & Mayberry, 2000). Thus, knowing a language (even if it is not the language captured in print) appears to facilitate learning to read. Nonetheless, skill in signing does not <b>guarantee</b> <b>skill</b> in reading—reading must be taught. The next frontier for reading research in deaf education is to understand how deaf readers map their knowledge of sign language onto print, and how instruction can best be used to turn signers into readers. Most profoundly deaf children read poorly. However, a small minority learn to read fluently. Understanding how profoundly deaf children learn, or fail to learn...|$|R

Crickets, and Orthoptera in general, are model organisms for the study of male-male aggression, although females can also be aggressive. According to Judge and Bonanno, the shape and size of male crickets' heads are a direct result of selection through male-male fights.|$|R
