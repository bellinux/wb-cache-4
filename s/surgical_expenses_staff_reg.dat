40|$|Despite {{the pivotal}} role of payroll staff within {{political}} parties’ central offices, {{research on the}} <b>staff</b> <b>expenses</b> of parties remains scarce. In this article, we study the relative <b>staff</b> <b>expenses</b> of political parties, this is staff costs {{as a percentage of}} total annual expenses. We analyse which factors explain the differences between parties’ relative <b>staff</b> <b>expenses,</b> based on a dataset of 590 individual observations representing 52 parties from seven European countries. The multivariate model shows that relative <b>staff</b> <b>expenses</b> are higher among left-oriented parties and that they increase with party age, party membership figures and the number of years a party has been in government, while they decrease with party income. Relative <b>staff</b> <b>expenses</b> also increase with the effective number of parties in the party system, but they are lower in election years. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Expose {{the weak}} loops in the Chinese medical {{insurance}} coverage and uncover hospitals' role of over-pricing hospitalized insured patients {{compared with those}} non-insured. Methods: A multi-linear regression method was used to analyze hospitalization expense for insured and uninsured patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, benign uterine tumors, and normal delivery. Results: Hospitalization cost is higher among insured than uninsured patients due to longer hospitalization lengths of stay, type of disease (highest among cholecystitis patients), type of gender - females, old-aged people, and type of marital status - singles, as well as drugs <b>expenses,</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>expenses,</b> and other medical acts. Conclusion: Require a better government's supervision system over medical insurance expenses such as reforming methods of payments, building up new cost compensation mechanism, and unifying and stabilizing prices for each category of medicines.

40|$|Descemet {{membrane}} endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) is a corneal {{surgical technique}} which selectively replaces the damaged posterior {{part of the}} cornea with a healthy donor graft retaining {{the rest of the}} tissue intact.

Thus, prospective potential surgeons and eye banks should now aim at developing new improved surgical techniques in order to prepare the best suited, validated, precut, preloaded, and easy to transplant tissue to reduce pre- and postsurgical complications.

40|$|Kidney {{transplantation}} significantly improves patient survival, and is {{the most}} cost effective renal replacement option compared with dialysis therapy. Living kidney donors provide a valuable societal gift, but face many formidable disincentive barriers that include not only short- and long-term health risks, but also concerns regarding financial expenditures and health insurance. Other than governmental coverage for their medical evaluation and <b>surgical</b> <b>expenses,</b> donors are often asked to personally bear a significant financial responsibility due to lost work wages and travel expenses. In order to alleviate this economic burden for donors, we advocate for the consideration of tax credits, lifelong health insurance coverage, and an outcomes registry as societal reciprocity to reward their altruistic act of kidney donation. Key words: kidney transplantation, live donor transplantation, policy, risk End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a terminal condition unless treated via dialysis or transplantation.

Design/methodology/approach – This case study reports on the collections presented to WIT Library Service and the approach taken to their conservation and display. It also discusses the ongoing issues involved in special collections management in a modern academic library setting. Findings – The paper concludes that there is a delicate balancing act involved in accepting and managing special collections in contemporary academic libraries. Key factors to consider are <b>expense,</b> <b>staff</b> time and skills, and potential benefits to the library and its users. Research limitations/implications – The project is still in development. The study provides a view on one medium-sized academic library's experience of handling special collections.

The {{collection}} of minutes comprises eleven quarto volumes of minutes of the Management Committee ranging from 1862 until 1945. The School was founded in June 1862, originally as the Hobart Town Female Refuge to provide a home for neglected girls and train them in washing, sewing and domestic work. It was managed by a committee of ladies elected by subscribers, usually under the patronage of the Governor’s wife, but five gentlemen were elected as governors and formed an advisory committee. The School took 30 to 40 girls, usually between 6 and 14, but occasionally younger, and the committee liked to keep them beyond their committal period until they were 16 and trained for service, unless there were suitable relatives. These records are the committee records only. There are no personal records of the girls or their background or committal orders.

40|$|Public {{institutions}} of {{lower secondary education}} are financed mainly from the public resources allocated from the local budget. Expenditures incurred from these resources have a maximum limit and a destination {{set out in the}} budget of each educational unit. The revenue and expenditure budget or only the expenditure budget of a lower secondary education institution provides for the maximum amounts to be used for the expenses made throughout a budgetary exercise. Therefore, reducing the share of social security contributions from your employer by five percentage points would affect the budget of such institutions as it would lead to a modification of the social insurance contributions expenses. In this paper we have described the structure of the current expenditure of a lower secondary education institution, especially with regard to <b>staff</b> <b>expenses,</b> because they hold the largest share in the total expenditure constantly incurred by the units concerned and are affected by the social security rate change. We have also presented the theoretical aspects related to the <b>staff</b> <b>expenses,</b> the budgetary execution phases that <b>staff</b> <b>expenses</b> must cover, the accounting treatment of costs of employers' social insurance contributions, the recognition of employers’ expenses for the social insurance State contributions in the bookkeeping of lower secondary education institutions, as well as the influence of changes in rates of the social security State contributions from the employer on the staff expenditure of the institutions mentioned...|$|R
