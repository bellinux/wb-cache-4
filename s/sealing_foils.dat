40|$|In {{the seal}} {{literature}} {{you can find}} many attempts by various researchers to adapt film riding seals to the gas turbine engine. None have been successful, potential distortion of the sealing faces is the primary reason. There is a film riding device that does accommodate distortion and is in service in aircraft applications, namely the foil bearing. More specifically a foil thrust bearing. These are {{not intended to be}} seals, and they do not accommodate large axial movement between shaft & static structure. By combining the 2 a unique type of face seal has been created. It functions like a normal face <b>seal.</b> The <b>foil</b> thrust bearing replaces the normal primary sealing surface. The compliance of the foil bearing allows the foils to track distortion of the mating <b>seal</b> ring. The <b>foil</b> <b>seal</b> has several perceived advantages over existing hydrodynamic designs, enumerated in the chart. Materials and design methodology needed for this application already exist.

Although grip strength was consistent for each posture, pinch grips and dexterity were adversely affected by the bed posture.

40|$|In {{practical}} forensic casework, backspatter {{recovered from}} shooters' hands {{can be an}} indicator of self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head. In such cases, backspatter retrieved from inside the barrel indicates that the weapon found at the death scene was involved in causing the injury to the head. However, systematic research on the aspects conditioning presence, amount and specific patterns of backspatter is lacking so far. Herein, a new concept of backspatter investigation is presented, comprising staining technique, weapon and target medium: the 'triple contrast method' was developed, tested and is introduced for experimental backspatter analysis. First, mixtures of various proportions of acrylic paint for optical detection, barium sulphate for radiocontrast imaging in computed tomography and fresh human blood for PCR-based DNA profiling were generated (triple mixture) and tested for DNA quantification and short tandem repeat (STR) typing success. All tested mixtures yielded sufficient DNA that produced full STR profiles suitable for forensic identification. Then, for backspatter analysis, <b>sealed</b> <b>foil</b> bags containing the triple mixture were attached to plastic bottles filled with 10 Â % ballistic gelatine and covered by a 2 - 3 -mm layer of silicone. To simulate backspatter, close contact shots were fired at these models.
