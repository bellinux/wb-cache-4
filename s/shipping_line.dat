5|$|The {{agreements}} to containerise Cunard's freight operations had returned the overall Cunard group to profitability, with the <b>shipping</b> <b>line</b> now profitable and the passenger ships losing money, {{a reversal of}} the situation Smallpeice had inherited in 1965. The company returned profits of £2 million in 1968 and £3 million in 1969 and the share price rose accordingly. The downturn in the economy and shipping industry in 1970 resulted in Cunard once again incurring a loss and a drop in the share price, resulting in the company becoming a takeover target.|$|E

Container ships were considered too large for the traditional British shipping lines, including Cunard and their subsidiaries to operate, so it would be necessary to form partnerships.|$|E

40|$|The present era of {{globalization}} and regional competition has witnessed the increasing influence of the global operations of the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> on port development and the declining monopoly of ports. This warrants {{the need for an}} identification of the port selection criteria {{from the perspective of the}} <b>shipping</b> <b>lines.</b> Hence, an attempt is made to determine the port choice from the perspective of the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines.</b> Moreover, most port operators have designed their strategies based on the 'stated preference' of the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines.</b> However, the stated preference approach can have several shortcomings such as the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> would tend to overstate their demands for services at the port. This directs for an examination of the port choice of the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> based on a revealed preference approach. The 'revealed preference' approach aims at judging the port choice of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> purely from their 'actions' rather than what they actually 'state'. The empirical study in this article is based on a survey conducted among major <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> operating in Singapore and Malaysia. The findings have shown port charges and wide range of port services to be the only significant factors in their port choice.

5|$|During {{the later}} 19th century, the major {{shipping}} lines financed Swedish emigrant agents {{and paid for}} the production of large quantities of emigration propaganda. Much of this promotional material, such as leaflets, was produced by immigration promoters in the U.S. Propaganda and advertising by <b>shipping</b> <b>line</b> agents was often blamed for emigration by the conservative Swedish ruling class, which grew increasingly alarmed at seeing the agricultural labor force leave the country. It was a Swedish 19th-century cliché to blame the falling ticket prices and the pro-emigration propaganda of the transport system for the craze of emigration, but modern historians have varying views about the real importance of such factors. Brattne and Åkerman have examined the advertising campaigns and the ticket prices as a possible third force between push and pull. They conclude that neither advertisements nor pricing had any decisive influence on Swedish emigration. While the companies remain unwilling, , to open their archives to researchers, the limited sources available suggest that ticket prices did drop in the 1880s, but remained on average artificially high because of cartels and price-fixing. On the other hand, H. A. Barton states that the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped drastically between 1865 and 1890, encouraging poorer Swedes to emigrate. The research of Brattne and Åkerman has shown that the leaflets sent out by the <b>shipping</b> <b>line</b> agents to prospective emigrants would not so much celebrate conditions in the New World, as simply emphasize the comforts and advantages of the particular company. Descriptions of life in America were unvarnished, and the general advice to emigrants brief and factual. Newspaper advertising, while very common, tended to be repetitive and stereotyped in content.|$|E

However, significant problems had emerged for the company, even though it remained in good financial standing.

40|$|In {{response}} to fierce competition of container cargo transportation markets, cooperation {{has become the}} mainstream of this era. Consolidation of shipping routes, globalization of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> and cooperation of port operators have emerged. This paper adopts a game theory approach to modelling consolidation of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> and ports, and establishes a two-stage game scenario with two ports and multiple <b>shipping</b> <b>lines.</b> In the first stage, <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> and ports decide their cooperative strategies based on their prediction. The second stage is modelled as a static game with the coalition and the others that have not joined the coalition. Numerical analysis is conducted to obtain the main properties of some key parameters {{as well as the}} best choices of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> and ports. The results show that the cooperation strategy of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> strongly depends on the supply and demand situation of ships. The port which collaborates with <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> will have a significant decrease in port charges, which creates an advantage of gaining more port calls and demand, but it will have a limited effect on the charge of the other port. The cooperation may result in a loss to the port, thus reallocation of profit is needed to maintain the coalition. MSc in Logistics and Transport Managemen...|$|R
