5|$|Officials in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma and Missouri opposed those {{elements}} of ACA over {{which they had}} discretion. For example, Missouri declined to expand Medicaid or establish a health insurance marketplace engaging in active non-cooperation, enacting a statute forbidding any state or local official to render any aid not <b>specifically</b> <b>required</b> by federal law. Other Republican politicians discouraged efforts to advertise {{the benefits of the}} law. Some conservative political groups launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its extreme rarity in nature, most {{francium}} is synthesised in the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5 n, yielding francium-209, francium-210, and francium-211. The greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300,000 neutral atoms, which were synthesised using the nuclear reaction given above. When the only natural isotope francium-223 is <b>specifically</b> <b>required,</b> it is produced as the alpha daughter of actinium-227, itself produced synthetically from the neutron irradiation of natural radium-226, one of the daughters of natural uranium-238.|$|E

25|$|The Zachman Framework {{summarizes}} {{a collection}} of perspectives involved in enterprise architecture. These perspectives are represented in a two-dimensional matrix that defines along the rows the type of stakeholders and with the columns the aspects of the architecture. The framework does not define a methodology for an architecture. Rather, the matrix is a template that must be filled in by the goals/rules, processes, material, roles, locations, and events <b>specifically</b> <b>required</b> by the organization. Further modeling by mapping between columns in the framework identifies gaps in the documented state of the organization.|$|E
25|$|Common {{practice}} in the Northern Ireland Civil Service, Derry City Council, and in communication throughout business and other organisations within Northern Ireland, when responding to {{a letter from a}} correspondent from the city or county, is to reply using the same nomenclature as the initial communication. Therefore, a letter addressed Derry will be replied to an address in Derry, while a letter addressed from Londonderry will be returned to an address in Londonderry. When the UK directory enquiries service was demonopolised in 2003, Oftel guidelines <b>specifically</b> <b>required</b> addresses using either name to be accessible.|$|E
25|$|The Pythons {{used the}} British {{tradition}} of cross-dressing comedy by donning frocks and makeup and playing female roles themselves while speaking in falsetto. Jones specialised in playing the working-class housewife, with Palin and Idle in being generally more posh. The other members played female roles more sparsely. Generally speaking, female roles were played by women {{only when the}} scene <b>specifically</b> <b>required</b> that the character be sexually attractive (although sometimes they used Idle for this). The troupe later turned to Carol Cleveland, who co-starred in numerous episodes after 1970. In some episodes and later in Monty Python's Life of Brian, they took the idea one step further by playing women who impersonated men (in the stoning scene).|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{claimed that}} prior Court rulings on tax payment regulations were not applicable because the 1862 the law <b>specifically</b> <b>required</b> payment {{to be made}} in person, but the Court disagreed and distinguished its previous decisions as being based on the 1862 law and its 1863 amendments. The government also claimed that the law did not permit payment to be made between the announcement of the tax sale and the date of the sale if the government were the purchaser. But the majority pointed out that this created a contradiction: How could the title holder know that the government was the purchaser until the actual purchase had occurred? This made no sense, and subsequently that section of the law was invalid.|$|E
25|$|Roman {{women were}} present at most festivals and cult observances. Some rituals <b>specifically</b> <b>required</b> the {{presence}} of women, but their active participation was limited. As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice, the central rite of most major public ceremonies. In addition to the public priesthood of the Vestals, some cult practices were reserved for women only. The rites of the Bona Dea excluded men entirely. Because women enter the public record less frequently than men, their religious practices are less known, and even family cults were headed by the paterfamilias. A host of deities, however, are associated with motherhood. Juno, Diana, Lucina, and specialized divine attendants presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby {{at a time when}} the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent.|$|E
500|$|One such problem set as a {{task for}} a genetic program was {{to design a}} {{crossover}} filter for woofer and tweeter loudspeakers. The output design was identical in topology to a design found in a patent of Zobel's for a filter to separate multiplexed low and high frequencies on a transmission line. This was judged to be human-comparable, {{not only because of}} the patent, but also because the high-pass and low-pass sections were [...] "decomposed" [...] as in Zobel's design, but not <b>specifically</b> <b>required</b> to be so in the programs parameters. Whether or not Zobel's filter design would be good for a hi-fi system is another question. The design does not actually cross over, but rather, there is a gap between the two pass-bands where the signal is not transmitted to either output. Essential for multiplexing, but not so desirable for sound reproduction.|$|E

2500|$|Thanksgiving {{services}} were routine in {{what became the}} Commonwealth of Virginia as early as 1607, with the first permanent settlement of Jamestown, Virginia holding a thanksgiving in 1610. In 1619, 38 English settlers arrived at Berkeley Hundred in Charles City County, Virginia. The group's London Company charter <b>specifically</b> <b>required</b> [...] "that the day of our ships arrival at the place assigned... {{in the land of}} Virginia shall be yearly and perpetually kept holy as a day of thanksgiving to Almighty God."

He [...] "seated himself in the place of the President" [...] and read his accession manifest. This, according to Korff, was the first ever precedent when the State Council convened at night. Nicholas went at lengths in explaining how the legal uncertainty set by Alexander lured him into pledging allegiance to Constantine. He <b>specifically</b> <b>required</b> [...] "that the time of Our accession to the Throne be counted from the 19th day of November 1825", the day of Alexander's death, sealing the fact that Constantine had never reigned and that the oath to Constantine was merely a misunderstanding rectified by Nicholas.
