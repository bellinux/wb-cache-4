40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to understand the behavior of metal-plate- connected (MPC) joints by examining actual MPC truss heel and tension <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> subjected to hurricane wind load simulations and impact loads. A hurricane wind load simulation was applied to MPC heel joints to determine if a large scale wind event would cause strength loss or change the joint stiffness. An "impact" load of one second duration (as defined by the American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA) (1991)) was also applied to MPC heel joints and tension <b>splice</b> <b>joints.</b> Two different impact loads were applied to MPC tension <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> to determine if strength degradation or stiffness change occurs due to loads with short duration and high maximum load. Finally, MPC tension <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> were subjected to a ramp load which linearly increased ten times faster than the control group ramp load to determine if shorter duration tests still produce "static" loading results. All observed properties were compared to a control group which was subjected to a static ramp load. Both MPC heel and tension <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> exhibited non-linear behavior under static ramp loads and failed with little warning because the tests were load- controlled. Tooth withdrawal, wood shear failure, and plate failure modes were all seen for both types of MPC joints. Heel joints tested with the top member in tension proved to have 17...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{an experimental}} program supported by an analytical modeling study undertaken {{to investigate the}} bond behavior of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials used for strengthening steel structures. The experimental program consisted of three double-lap shear coupon tests and five large-scale beam tests. Different methods to reduce the bond stress concentrations near the plate ends were investigated including increasing {{the length of the}} splice cover plate and implementing a reverse-tapered plate end configuration. Three-dimensional linear and non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted to study the cracking behavior of the <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> and to determine the effect of the reverse-taper on the interface shear and normal (peeling) stress distributions near the plate ends. The research findings indicate that implementation of the reverse taper at the plate ends can double the splice capacity as compared to conventional square plate ends. Based on the research findings simple design recommendations are presented to increase the ultimate capacity of <b>splice</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper demonstrates that <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> can be effectively implemented to facilitate the use of CFRP strengthening systems for strengthening and repair of long-span steel beams...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Mechanically {{fastened}} <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> like spar <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> {{are essential}} {{in a large}} aircraft structure like wing to join inboard and outboard pieces spar members. Typically in a spar splice joint the inboard and outboard pieces of the spars are mechanically joined using splice plates.

In this paper the design procedure of a spar splice joint in a Carbon Fibre Composite (CFC) wing for a light transport aircraft is presented. The methodology of design in the preliminary design stage and the design validation with an element level test are discussed. Conventional strength of materials approach of the mechanically fastened joints is quite extensively used in the design.

The analysis considers the strength of <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> used in aerofoils consisting of two stringers and one splice which are connected to each other by means of aluminium rivets to form a single cover butt joint. This aluminium riveted carbon fibre structure is analysed using experimental tests and these results are validated using numerical simulations.

40|$|AbstractCSIR -National Aerospace Laboratories (CSIR-NAL) has {{developed}} a patented processing technique called “Vacuum Enabled Resin Infusion Technology (VERITy” for the manufacturing of composite wing for its transport aircraft programme. The building block approach was adopted during the design stage of the composite wing to understand the structural response in increasingly complex structural levels. In the subcomponent level, a wing test box was designed, fabricated and was subjected to structural static testing for critical loads of the wing. The wing test box which was idealized into a rectangular box included the most critical joints such as top & bottom skin <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> and front & rear spar <b>splice</b> <b>joints.</b> The stacking sequence and thickness of laminates used in the respective positions in wing test box replicated the wing structure. The challenge was to maintain the shear flow despite differences in the geometry of wing and test box without compromising on the magnitude of shear force at the critical spar splice joint. This paper discusses the methodology adopted for transforming shear flow from wing structure on to the idealized wing test box...|$|E

The design has been validated subsequently with static test on a spar splice specimen that has all the essential features of the splice joint in the wing. The various constraints in synthesizing the design of test specimen (which is an 13; open section) to nearly simulate the wing (which is a closed box) are discussed.

40|$|The {{attachment}} joints {{are inevitable}} in any large structure like an airframe. Splicing is normally used {{to retain a}} clean aerodynamic surface of the wing skin. The wings {{are the most important}} lift-producing part of the aircraft. Wings vary in design depending upon the aircraft type and its purpose. The wing box has two crucial <b>joints,</b> the skin <b>splice</b> <b>joint</b> and spar <b>splice</b> <b>joint.</b> Top and bottom skins of inboard and outboard portions are joined together by means of skin splicing. Front and rear spars of inboard and outboard are joined together by means of spar splicing. The skins resist much of the bending moment in the wing and the spars resist the shear force. In this study the chord-wise splicing of wing skin is considered for a detailed analysis. The splicing is considered as a multi row riveted joint under the action of tensile in plane load due to wing bending. Stress analysis of the joint is carried out to compute the stresses at rivet holes due to by-pass load and bearing load. The stresses are estimated using the finite element approach with the help of PATRAN/NASTRAN. In a structure like airframe, a fatigue crack will appear at the location of high tensile stress. Further these locations are invariably the sites of high stress concentration. Life prediction requires a model for fatigue damage accumulation, constant amplitude S-N (stress life) data for various stress ratios and local stress history at the stress concentration The response of the <b>splice</b> <b>joint</b> will be evaluated. The <b>splice</b> <b>joint</b> is one of the critical locations for fatigue crack to initiate. In this study prediction of fatigue life for crack initiation will be carried out at maximum stress location...|$|R

The method used to fabricate three beams, {{each with a}} six-plate bonded <b>splice</b> <b>joint</b> at mid-span, is outlined. Details of the instrumentation used to measure deflections, etc. during three-point flexure tests on the beams are given. Deflections, support rotations and mid-span strains recorded during the tests are presented. Formulae, based on shear deformation beam theory, are presented for predicting the centre deflection and the support rotations of the beams. It is shown that they predict deflections and rotations with a maximum error of about 10 %, provided the elastic moduli are derived from coupon tests rather than the manufacturer's minimum values. The theory is extended to provide a simple method, based on the solution of a quadratic equation, for determining the optimum and limiting splice length ratios for particular values of the additional cross-sectional area and additional {{second moment of area}} factors and the shear flexibility parameter.
