40|$|We {{have shown}} that the descent of the {{nanocrystal}} symmetry from spherical to point group Cs, which is characterized by just one mirror plane symmetry element, leads step by step to activation of all five F = 2, Fz= 2, 1, 0 excitons. Even the ground exciton becomes optically active, which should be observable in low-temperature photoluminescence measurements. For several intermediate symmetries the band edge exciton fine structure consists of sets of three linearly polarized mutually orthogonal dipoles plus a dark exciton, one of which is always the ground state. We quantify the effect of symmetry descent on the exciton fine structure by introducing a charged Coulomb impurity in the nanocrystals. The calculations show that the nanocrystal symmetry breaking by a Coulomb impurity, particularly a positively charged <b>center,</b> <b>shortens</b> the radiative decay of nanocrystals even at room temperatures in qualitative agreement with the increase in PL efficiency observed in nanocrystals doped with positive Ag charge centers...|$|R
