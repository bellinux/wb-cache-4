When I was in elementary school, I only had two male teachers. Should I have listened to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> male <b>colleagues</b> during <b>my</b> teacher eduation and decided instead to teach high school? At times, I wonder how other teachers perceive me. How do parents and students perceive me? Often, I find myself asking these questions.

6000|$|Under the {{regulations}} to which I refer, a schoolmaster {{can set up}} a class {{in one or more}} branches of science; his pupils will be examined, and the State will pay him, at a certain rate, for all who succeed in passing. I have acted as an examiner under this system from the beginning of its establishment, and this year I expect to have not fewer than a couple of thousand sets of answers to questions in Physiology, mainly from young people of the artisan class, who have been taught in the schools which are now scattered all over great Britain and Ireland. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleagues,</b> who have to deal with subjects such as Geometry, for which the present teaching power is better organised, I understand are likely to have three or four times as many papers. So far as my own subjects are concerned, I can undertake to say that {{a great deal of the}} teaching, the results of which are before me in these examinations, is very sound and good; and I think it is in the power of the examiners, not only to keep up the present standard, but to cause an almost unlimited improvement. Now what does this mean? It means that by holding out a very moderate inducement, the masters of primary schools in many parts of the country have been led to convert them into little foci of scientific instruction; and that they and their pupils have contrived to find, or to make, time enough to carry out this object with a very considerable degree of efficiency. That efficiency will, I doubt not, be very much increased as the system becomes known and perfected, even with the very limited leisure left to masters and teachers on week-days. And this leads me to ask, Why should scientific teaching be limited to week-days? ...|$|E

30|$|And {{this raises}} the progressive’s dilemma. We need {{multiculturalism}} to make liberal nationalism legitimate, but multiculturalist reforms may weaken the bonds of nationhood and hence its ability to secure stability and solidarity. I should emphasize that I am not claiming – as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> liberal nationalist <b>colleagues</b> do – that nationhood is the only possible basis for achieving progressive ends, or {{that there are no}} alternative ways of generating converging preferences on political units, or generating a solidaristic ethics of social membership. I welcome attempts to develop alternative accounts of political order that seek to avoid reliance on nationhood, including various post-national cosmopolitan, agonistic, or ecological theories of democracy and citizenship. One of the central tasks of political theory is to imagine other worlds – to theorize possible alternatives to nationhood as the basis for democracy and redistribution. Political theory should open up our political imagination, not close it down.|$|R

What are the costs and benefits of feeding on different prey?

40|$|I {{am taking}} {{the liberty of}} lecturing here in the same spirit in which I wrote the book MAN AND DOLPHIN. In that book I assume that a lay-man is anyone {{with an open mind}} and a broad view. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{scientific}} <b>colleagues,</b> in order to avoid this label, look at: my writing with a narrow view and a closed-down mind. This, of course, automatically disqualifies them from being called laymen. The medical researcher, of necessity, is influenced to a consider-able extent by his medical colleagues. The man receiving medical training is forced to broaden his view intellectually, emotionally, morally and ethically. He bears the brunt of the responsibility for the well-being of members of his own species; when he takes such responsibility he must under-go many disillusionments about Home sapiens. However, the reward usually outbalances the disillusion. He may arrive at a position in which he evaluates certain aspects of human activities with more objectivity than probably any other type of scientist. Other kinds of scientists, especially in the biological sphere, focus their attention down on a smalt narrow area, sometimes but not always, {{to the detriment of the}} wider view. Some such persons tend to penalize those who use a non-Baconian approach to scientific research. Let me quote from Professor Donald Hebb's Hughlings Jackson Memorial Lecture in which he said, "it is clearly implied that scientific investigation proceeds first by the collection of facts and arrives secondly at generalizations from the facts...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{expression}} that I have encountered repeatedly in talking with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> medical school <b>colleagues</b> which, I have no doubt, is also used in undergraduate colleges, namely: "spoon feeding.

I cannot remember that I have ever heard a definition of spoon feeding. Hence, I am not certain that I know what is meant by it, but I believe that imparting knowledge in a palatable form constitutes this despicable habit. If I am correct in assuming that this is what is meant, I have no hesitation in saying that I always have been, and still am, a firm believer in the baleful practice.

5000|$|Scientists {{and their}} {{supporters}} used the term quote mining {{as early as the}} mid-1990s in newsgroup posts to describe quoting practices of certain creationists. The term is used by members of the scientific community to describe a method employed by creationists to support their arguments, though it can be and often is used outside of the creation-evolution controversy. Complaints about the practice predate known use of the term: Theodosius Dobzhansky wrote in his famous 1973 essay [...] "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution": [...] Their Creationists' favorite sport is stringing together quotations, carefully and sometimes expertly taken out of context, to show that nothing is really established or agreed upon among evolutionists. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> and myself have been amused and amazed to read ourselves quoted in a way showing that we are really antievolutionists under the skin.|$|E

40|$|What {{students}} know about making {{good use of}} learning and teaching situations The issues I address in this paper are not novel for people who teach or advise students about study. Lecturers and study advisors both confront {{the problem of how}} to help students develop knowledge that can later be used to solve the problems they face in their academic and work lives. We know that many students construct knowledge that sets them up well for such problem solving and we meet others who do not. It is students in the latter group who will often seek our advice about how they might prepare themselves more effectively for, say, their geography or biology assignments or exams. My concern here is not directly with what the {{students know}} about their geography or biology, but with what they know about how to act when they are in their geography or biology classes, or when they are studying outside of class time. In particular I want to discuss both what students know about what to do in these teaching-learning situations and how good is the quality of that knowledge. In doing this I will draw upon <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the research <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> and I have been undertaking with students in schools and in a range of university programs, both in Australia and in Vietnam.

40|$|Upon reflection, I {{conclude}} {{that it was}} in a moment of weakness that I consented to formulate my thoughts on the problems of teaching botany in an elementary course, whether this is called botany or biology. This is because there is no one perfect solution. for {{there are so many different}} ways in achieve essentially desirable ends I begin with a general remark be-cause <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> botanical <b>colleagues</b> seem to have doubts about the current status of botanical science and its fu-ture. I am so prompted because I, like others, recall an experience at the last International Botanical Congress held at Edinburgh. There were those at that Congress who bewailed the status of botany, referring to it as the "Cinder-ella of the biological sciences, " and, weeping at a sort of botanical wailing~ wrul, they wondered what was going to happen next. And, of course. their fear was that botany would lose its identity and be swallowed up in an amorphous sort of general biology on the one hand or become a branch of biochem-istry on the other. However, I am not one who shares these fears. I see noth~ ing wrong with the subject of botany and, you note, I don't hesitate to call it botany- or plant science if you will. (Although I now enjoy the title of Alexander Professor of Biological Sci~ ences, it is clear from what I do that I am stil 1 a Professor of Botany under another name.) I begin, therefore, with the assertion that there is nothing wrong with the plants; there is nothing wrong with the problems; there is, in short, nothing wrong with the subject that an aggressive, interesting. modern presentation of botanical problems to fresh, eager young minds will not solve. This type of presentation is the first thing that a first-rate, first year course should do. At the outset, it will be noted, I un-hesitatingly speak for the identified study of plants. Plants are not ani-mals- and I reiterate this after a long and checkered career! Higher plants are not merely something more com-plicated than bacteria, nor are the...|$|R

40|$|An {{overview}} of psychiatry {{during the last}} three decades as practised in a general teaching hospital is presented. Psychiatry as an academic subject has matured tremendously during this period. The empirical treatments of the 1950 s and the 1960 s which evoke nostalgic memories, have been replaced by modern methods of treatment. However, {{there is a need to}} exercise caution against the blind acceptance of new and sophisticated research findings in biological psychiatry. Inspite of the bright future facing psychiatry, the identity of psychiatry as a medical discipline must be preserved at all cost. Psychiatrists should also realise the dangers of gradual fractionation and impersonalisation which threatens the speciality, and makes all possible efforts to prevent this. Key Words. General hospital psychiatry, three decades overview Mr. President, dignitaries on the dais, <b>my</b> distinguished <b>colleagues,</b> ladies and gentlemen.

40|$|A digest of {{the authors}} opening remarks at the 2011 Hadron Collider Physics Symposium. I have chosen my title to reflect the {{transitions}} we are living through, in particle physics overall and in hadron collider physics in particular. Data-taking has ended at the Tevatron, with {approx} 12 fb{sup - 1 } of {bar p}p interactions delivered to CDF and D 0 at {radical}s = 1. 96 TeV. The Large Hadron Collider has registered a spectacular first full-year run, with ATLAS and CMS seeing > 5 fb{sup - 1 }, LHCb recording {approx} 1 fb{sup - 1 }, and ALICE logging nearly 5 pb{sup - 1 } of pp data at {radical}s = 7 TeV, plus {{a healthy dose of}} Pb-Pb collisions. The transition to a new energy regime and new realms of instantaneous luminosity exceeding 3. 5 x 10 {sup 33 } cm{sup - 2 } s{sup - 1 } has brought the advantage of enhanced physics reach and the challenge of pile-up reaching {approx} 15 interactions per beam crossing. I am happy to record that what the experiments have (not) found so far has roused <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> theoretical <b>colleagues</b> from years of complacency and stimulated them to think anew about what the TeV scale might hold. We theorists have {{had plenty of time to}} explore many proposals for electroweak symmetry breaking and for new physics that might lie beyond established knowledge. With so many different theoretical inventions in circulation, it is in the nature of things that most will be wrong. Keep in mind that we learn from what experiment tells us is not there, even if it is uncommon to throw a party for ruling something out. Some non-observations may be especially telling: the persistent absence of flavor-changing neutral currents, for example, seems to me more and more an important clue that we have not yet deciphered. It is natural that the search for the avatar of electroweak symmetry breaking preoccupies participants and spectators alike. But it is essential to conceive the physics opportunities before us in their full richness. I would advocate a three-fold approach: Explore, Search, Measure! The first phase of running at the LHC has brought us to two new lands - in proton-proton and lead-lead collisions - and we may well enter other new lands with each change of energy or increase of sensitivity. I believe that it will prove very rewarding to spend some time simply exploring each new landscape, without strong preconceptions, to learn what is there and, perhaps, to encounter interesting surprises. Directed searches, for which we have made extensive preparations, are of self-evident interest. Here the challenge will be to broaden the searches over time, so the searches are not too narrowly directed. Our very successful conception of particles and forces is highly idealized. We have a great opportunity to learn just how comprehensive is our network of understanding by making precise measurements and probing for weak spots, or finding more sweeping accord between theory and experiment...|$|R
