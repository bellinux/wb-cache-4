40|$|Abstract − One of {{the most}} {{significant}} problems in realising hardness traceability are reference <b>hardness</b> <b>blocks</b> failures. The work included testing on one standard block prepared in compliance with the requirements defined in EN ISO 6507 - 3 standard. It was calibrated on the reference hardness testing machine. For the analysis of the <b>hardness</b> <b>block</b> surface and the indentation, a scanning electron microscope TESCAN, type: VEGA TSS 136 LS with EDS sensor was applied. Failures caused by the reference <b>hardness</b> <b>blocks</b> finishing and failures due to the material inhomogeneity were noted. Microanalysis of the chemical composition on typical spots was carried out with EDS sensor. Key words: Vickers hardness, scanning electron microscope, reference <b>hardness</b> <b>block</b> 1. SCOPE The reference <b>hardness</b> <b>blocks</b> are applied for indirect verification of the hardness testing machines and their quality has direct influence on the measurement uncertainty of the calibrated device. Material inhomogeneity problems and occurrence of impurities cause variations in the measurement results and are already known according to the published papers. Also, during the investigations, the reference <b>hardness</b> <b>block</b> surface may get contaminated by impurities, oxides etc. The mentioned phenomena affect the results of hardness measurements and for that purpose the following investigations have been carried out:- surface inspection with the scanning electron microscope,- microanalysis of the chemical elements on the investigated surface and in the indentation.

40|$|The {{potential}} of nanostructured WC–Co hardmetal as reference material for Vickers hardness was researched in this paper. Preliminary reference Vickers <b>hardness</b> <b>blocks</b> were developed from a WC 9 –Co mixture. The WC powder used was nanoscaled {{and had a}} grain size of 150 nm and a specific surface area of 2. 5 m 2 /g. <b>Hardness</b> <b>blocks</b> were consolidated using the Sinter-HIP process. Properties of the sintered material were obtained by using standard measurement techniques like magnetic properties or the SEM analysis of microstructure. Special {{emphasis was placed on}} hardness uniformity of the test surface as it is the most important property placed on reference <b>hardness</b> <b>blocks.</b> <b>Hardness</b> uniformity was tested by analysis of variance, ANOVA, for single factor in order to determine if significant hardness variations across the block surface were present.

40|$|Abstract − The authors numerically {{discuss the}} {{accuracy}} of the hardness values of standard <b>hardness</b> <b>blocks</b> by evaluating the uniformity of <b>hardness</b> <b>blocks</b> and the resolution of hardness values according to test method. As a result of reviewing the results of this evaluation and the reasonability of the currently proposed method for evaluating the uncertainty of hardness values, it is revealed that the variance of hardness values of popular standard blocks for hardness—Rockwell and Vickers—is extremely small (σ≦ 0. 05 HRC, including the variance attributable to the tester). It is also found that the depth-measuring Rockwell test method shows higher resolution of hardness values than the Vickers test method using microscopic measurements. Regarding the uncertainty of hardness, it is technically impossible to have discussions on {{the accuracy of}} uncertainty. Prior to discussing the uncertainty of hardness testing, we believe more efforts should be directed to studying ways to improve the accuracy and reliability of the testing method itself...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − In the {{uncertainty}} budget of Rockwell C hardness (HRC) tests, geometric error of the Rockwell diamond indenter {{is a major}} contributor. The geometric calibration of Rockwell diamond indenters has been a key issue for Rockwell hardness standardization. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a microform calibration system based on a stylus instrument for the geometric calibration of Rockwell diamond indenters. Using that system, a NIST master standard Rockwell diamond indenter No. 3581 was established in 1995, by which approximately 300 standard reference material (SRM) Rockwell <b>hardness</b> <b>blocks</b> of HRC scale were calibrated for implementation of the HRC scale in the United States. This indenter has been re-calibrated in 1997, 2005 and 2007. The calibration results have shown both high stability for the NIST standard Rockwell diamond indenter and high reproducibility for the NIST microform calibration system. After more than fifteen years of service, the stylus instrument was recently replaced by a new one. In order to test the measurement agreement between the two stylus instruments, another NIST master Rockwell diamond indenter No. 101 has been recently calibrated by the new instrument and the calibration result shows good agreement with the previous results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this work is to analyse and discuss {{the influence of the}} use of different numerical apertures (NA) and its magnification on the measurement of indentations on Vickers (HV) and Brinell (HB) <b>hardness</b> <b>blocks</b> previously certified. It was used a new reference Vickers and Brinell measurement system, recently installed and qualified at the Brazilian National Metrology Institute (Inmetro) by the National Institute of Metrological Research (iNRiM/Italy) [1]. The system used was a Galileo Galvision (LTF S. p. A., Italy) that carries out automatic measurements throughout two methods, the direct and the indirect ones. In the present work both direct and indirect methods were used. In general, the 10 x lens magnification and its 0, 25 numerical aperture yielded the acceptable normalized error (En) for almost all HV and HB indentation measurements done, no matter the method used. As reference values six certified blocks in three levels of hardness were studied, e. g. blocks of low, medium and high hardness values. Among them, the lowest range of Vickers hardness provided the better normalized error. The same results were obtained by analyzing the highest range of Brinell hardness, no matter the method used...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Methods for {{hardness}} measurement on elastomers {{are characterized by}} a set-up where indenters with various defined geometries are pressed under defined test forces into the surface of testing material. The hardness value represents {{the resistance of the}} material to the rigid indenter and is calculated from the indentation depth of the indenter in the to be tested material. The test methods IRHD and Shore are the most common methods used in the field of rubber {{hardness measurement}}s. Appropriate hardness measuring instruments are spread world wide. A periodic verification has to be carried out to assure the accuracy of these measuring instruments. Direct and indirect verification methods are recommended to be used. For the indirect method rubber <b>hardness</b> reference <b>blocks</b> are used. This indirect verification method is especially appropriate for the daily check of hand held rubber hardness testers.

Methods Bacterial killing in biofilms by the disinfectants and MUP was determined as the reduction [%] in metabolic activity determined by a biofilm viability assay that uses kinetic analysis of metabolic activity. The test substances were diluted in water with <b>standardized</b> <b>hardness</b> (WSH) at 25  °C at the standard concentration as well as half the standard concentration to demonstrate the dilution effects in a practical setting. The tested concentrations were: CHG 1 %, 2 %; OCT 0. 1 %, 0. 05 %; PH 0. 04 %, 0. 02 %; and CLO 0. 12 %, 0. 24 %. A test organism suspension, 1  mL containing ~ 1 [*]×[*] 109 bacterial cells/mL, and 1  mL of sterile WSH were mixed and incubated for six different exposure times (15  s, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 20  min) after the test substance was added. Additionally, the bactericidal effects of all substances were tested on planktonic bacteria and measured as the log 10 reduction. Results The disinfectants OCT and CHG showed good efficacy in inhibiting MRSA in biofilms with reduction rates of 94 [*]±[*] 1 % and 91 [*]±[*] 1 %, respectively. POL, on the other hand, had a maximum efficacy of only 81 [*]±[*] 7 %. Compared to the tested disinfectants, MUP showed a significantly lower efficacy with < 20 % inhibition (p[*]<[*]. 05). Bactericidal effects were the greatest for CHG (log 10 reduction of 9. 0), followed by OCT (7. 7), POL (5. 1), and CLO (6. 8). MUP, however, showed a very low bactericidal effect of only 2. 1. Even when the exposure time was increased to 24  h, 2 % MUP did not show sufficient bactericidal effect. Conclusions Our data provide evidence that OCT and CHG are effective components for disinfection of MRSA-biofilms. On the other hand, exposure to MUP at the standard concentrations in topical preparations did not effectively inhibit MRSA-biofilms and also did not show adequate bactericidal effects.
