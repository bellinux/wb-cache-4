25|$|Black-and-white film in {{that era}} was {{sensitive}} to blue light, not the reds and oranges of hot steel, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the beauty, but the photographs were coming out all black. She solved this problem by bringing along a new style of magnesium flare, which produces white light, and having assistants hold them to light her scenes. Her abilities resulted {{in some of the}} best steel factory photographs of that era, which earned her national attention.|$|E
25|$|As the Paroubeks {{were not}} Catholics but freethinkers, {{there were no}} prayers, and the service was read by Rudolf Jaromír Pšenka, editor of the Bohemian Chicago Daily Svornost. He spoke {{of the need to}} {{cooperate}} with police to find Elsie's killers. As the undertaker went to lift the coffin into the hearse, Karolina begged him to open it <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Elsie's face once more, but her relatives persuaded her not to insist on this and led her away. Most of the attendees followed Elsie's casket to Bohemian National Cemetery, where Pšenka gave another address.|$|E
2500|$|Ross {{took his}} wife Mary and the {{children}} to Philadelphia <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her family. Ross returned to Washington, where he had an inconclusive meeting with President Lincoln and other supporters. When he returned for Mary in 1865, he found her gravely ill with what was diagnosed as [...] "lung congestion" [...] (likely tuberculosis). She could not travel, so he remained with her {{for more than a}} month. Mary died of her illness on July 20, 1865. She was buried in her native Delaware. Ross returned to Indian Territory after her funeral.|$|E
60|$|The doctor {{stepped around}} <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him, and nodded.|$|R
60|$|She laughed, {{and moved}} her parasol a little <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him better.|$|R
6000|$|Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob {{from the}} top of an andiron, and passed it around her <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it, and said: ...|$|R
2500|$|When a man threw {{ashes and}} tares about {{to try to}} see King Goldemar's footprints, the kobold cut him to pieces, put him on a spit, roasted him, boiled his legs and head, and ate him. The Heinzelmänchen of Cologne marched from the city and sailed away when a tailor's wife strewed peas on the stairs to trip them <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> them. In 1850, Keightley noted that the Heinzelmänchen [...] " [...] totally disappeared, as has been {{everywhere}} the case, owing to the curiosity of people, which has at all times been the destruction of so much of what was beautiful in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{accident}} ended Kahlo's {{dreams of}} becoming a doctor and caused her pain and illness {{for the rest of}} her life; her friend Andrés Henestrosa stated that Kahlo [...] "lived dying". During her recovery, she started to consider a career as a medical illustrator, which would combine her interests in science and art, and began to paint. She had a specially-made easel that enabled her to paint in bed, and a mirror was placed above it <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> herself. [...] Painting became a way for Kahlo to explore questions of identity and existence, and she later stated that the accident and the isolating recovery period made her desire, [...] "to begin again, painting things just as I saw them with my own eyes and nothing more." ...|$|E
60|$|That hurt Nurse's feelings, and {{she went}} away without her good-night kiss. But May didn't care, and felt under her pillow the minute the door was shut. A lamp was always left burning; <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the little gold box she drew out.|$|E
60|$|The girl moved {{a little}} <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{his face in}} the light from the stove, and it was quietly stern, but the {{movement}} had served two purposes, for her own was now invisible.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she leaned}} a little toward him. One swift hand flew up {{to tear the}} black hood back <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> In its place flashed her white face. And her eyes were like the night.|$|R
60|$|Amelius told Sally {{to wait in}} the cab. She saw his altered looks, and entreated him not {{to leave}} her. He promised to keep the house door open <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him while he was away from her, and hastened into the hall.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{something}} queer {{about the}} folks at Bigbee's," [...] Mary Louise confided to Irene, as {{she went to her}} friend's room to assist her in preparing for bed. [...] "Agatha Lord kept looking at that velvet ribbon around your neck, to-night, as if she couldn't keep her eyes off it, and this afternoon she seemed scared by the news of Sarah Judd's arrival and wasn't happy until she had seen her. Then, again, that queer maid of Agatha's, Susan, drove us home <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Sarah Judd for herself. How do you account for all that, Irene?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then at {{last she}} heard him softly draw the great knife from the sheath, and in another second he had glided from her side. Presently she saw the line of light that {{streamed}} upon the darkness through {{the opening of the}} tent broaden a little, and by this she knew that he was creeping in upon his dreadful errand. Then she turned her head and put her fingers in her ears. But even <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> a long line of shadow travelling across the skirt of the tent. So she shut her eyes also, and waited sick at heart, for she did not dare to move.|$|E
60|$|Then, rising {{somewhat}} abruptly, {{she flung}} the book aside, {{and went down}} the wide cedar stairway to search for another that might, perhaps, hold her attention more firmly. When she reached the foot of it she turned into a corridor, and stopped a moment when she heard a murmur of angry voices. She was aware that {{a member of the}} Provincial Legislature had reached the house not long ago, and that the rest of her father's guests had come there to discuss something with him, while as the door of the room reserved for them had been left open a foot or <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> within from where she stood.|$|E
60|$|Whatever threatened, {{it would}} be met and checked by this man Stewart, who was thundering up on his fleet horse; and as he neared her, <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the dark gleam of face and eyes, she had a strange feeling of trust in her {{dependence}} upon him.|$|R
60|$|She did not cry {{out to him}} again, but she crept {{a little}} nearer. A strange surmise made her eyes dilate. With a painful wrench she pulled herself up <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{completely}} over the intervening lumps of smashed-up masonry. Her hand touched something wet, and after one convulsive movement she became rigid.|$|R
60|$|He was {{standing}} immediately {{inside the door}} at the bottom, though it was <b>so</b> dark <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>see</b> him. The villagers were audibly talking just without.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I am. You see I heard several talking {{together}} the other evening at Annabel's, {{only a few}} words, but it hurt me very much, for nearly everyone was speculating on what I would give them and hoping {{it would be something}} fine. 'She's so rich she ought to be generous,' said one. 'I've been perfectly devoted to her for weeks and hope she won't forget it,' said another. 'If she doesn't give me some of her gloves, I shall think she's very mean, for she has heaps, and I tried on a pair in fun <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> they fitted and take a hint,' added a third. I did take the hint, you see." [...] And Rose opened a handsome box in which lay several pairs of her best gloves, with buttons enough to satisfy the heart of the most covetous.|$|E
60|$|But as {{she became}} aware of this a new trouble arose and harassed her very soul. When she had asked for the six months she had not at the moment been aware, she had not then felt, that a girl who asks for time is {{supposed}} to have already surrendered. But since she had made that unhappy request the conviction had grown upon her. She had read it in every word her stepmother said to her and in her father's manner. The very winks and hints and little jokes which fell from her younger sisters told her that it was <b>so.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> around her the satisfaction which had come from the settlement of that difficult question,--a satisfaction which was perhaps more apparent with her father than even with the others. Then she knew what she had done, and remembered to have heard that a girl who expresses a doubt {{is supposed to have}} gone beyond doubting. While she was still at Dillsborough there was a feeling that no evil would arise from this if she could at last make up her mind to be Mrs. Twentyman;--but when the settled conviction came upon her, after hearing Reginald Morton's words, then she was much troubled.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{why have}} you told her so? Why have you taken upon {{yourself}} to judge for me in such a matter, as though I were a child? Mother, you must unsay what you have said." [...] Lord Lufton, as he spoke, looked full into his mother's face; and he did so, not {{as though he were}} begging from her a favour, but issuing to her a command. She stood near him, with one hand on the breakfast-table, gazing at him almost furtively, not quite daring to meet the full view of his eye. There was only one thing on earth which Lady Lufton feared, and that was her son's displeasure. The sun of her earthly heaven shone upon her through the medium of his existence. If she were driven to quarrel with him, as some ladies of her acquaintance were driven to quarrel with their sons, the world to her would be over. Not but what facts might be so strong as to make it absolutely necessary that she should do this. As some people resolve that, under certain circumstances, they will commit suicide, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that, under certain circumstances, she must consent even to be separated from him. She would not do wrong,--not that which she knew to be wrong,--even for his sake. If it were necessary that all her happiness should collapse and be crushed in ruin around her, she must endure it, and wait God's time to relieve her from so dark a world. The light of the sun was very dear to her, but even that might be purchased at too dear a cost.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{when her}} fear {{was a little}} abated she clambered into a more {{comfortable}} position, where a great branch forked. The trees rose about her, <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing of Brother Fire, who is black by day. Birds began to stir, and things that had gone into hiding for fear of her movements crept out....|$|R
6000|$|... "That is my {{abstract}} on {{a lecture}} on the circulation of the blood," [...] he answered, kindly turning it <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> [...] "I don't write romances I'm living one," [...] and he glanced up with the happy, hopeful expression which always made her feel {{as if he was}} heaping coals of fire on her head.|$|R
60|$|Harry and Kate were silent. They had mourned {{over the}} news, and Kate had cried. There {{was nothing more}} {{to be done about}} it, <b>so</b> far as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hudson and Bess were dining companions with Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen. At {{dinner on}} 14 April, they brought Loraine {{to the dining}} room with them <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> how pretty it was.|$|E
50|$|Peng {{questioned}} Arnold, {{and began}} inspecting his luggage, noting {{a laptop computer}} and several computer accessories. Peng instructed Arnold {{to turn on the}} computer <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> if it was functioning. CBP Officer John Roberts was called to assist with the inspection while the computer was booting up.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} gain a quilter’s {{perspective}} into quiltmaking, Benberry joined various round robin groups (pattern exchanges). Because Cuesta herself was not a quilt-maker, the members of these networks would often send her completed blocks <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> what they should look like. By joining round robin groups, Benberry developed friendships with active quilters and found a network of people also interested in studying quilt history.|$|E
60|$|Helen turned {{towards the}} window, and Geoffrey, who groaned inwardly, placed himself <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see.</b> There was a rustle of skirts, and swift, light {{footsteps}} approached.|$|R
50|$|In the Palace of Westminster {{the lantern}} {{at the top}} of the Elizabeth Tower (commonly called Big Ben) is called the Ayrton Light, lit when either House of Parliament is sitting after dark. It was {{installed}} in 1885 at the request of Queen Victoria <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from Buckingham Palace when the members were sitting and named after Ayrton.|$|R
60|$|She {{stood looking}} at them intently until they had passed her, then walked away with her eyes bent on the ground, {{and made her way}} to a small lodging she had taken in the town. For several days <b>she</b> placed herself <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the boys on their way to and fro between River-Smith's and the college, and watched them at football.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after Sebastian's birth, Joanna {{was called}} back to Madrid by her brother Philip to act as regent during his absence in England. She filled this role with {{intelligence}} and efficiency. Joanna never remarried and never returned to Portugal. She never saw her son Sebastian again, although she sent him letters and had portraits of him painted at various ages <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> what he looked like.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{crash landing}} on planet H2O, where through a special sort of water, known as [...] "telessotelepathic waves", which allowed the invaders to breathe under the waves, Kaput had, {{in order to}} be king, almost ended up marrying a huge, repulsive squid-like {{creature}} who happened to be the queen of the planet. The princess, however considered the two to actually stay on the planet <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Kaput get kissed (tortured) ...|$|E

60|$|When {{some time}} had passed the witch told her {{daughter}} to go and cut a finger off Esben, <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> whether he was nearly fat enough yet. The daughter went and told Esben, and asked him what she should do. Esben told her to take an iron nail and wrap a piece of skin round it: <b>she</b> <b>could</b> then give her mother this to bite at.|$|R
50|$|Dolly Shepherd {{was born}} in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, England, as Elizabeth Shepherd. At the age of 16, she {{got a job as}} a {{waitress}} at the Alexandra Palace in North London <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the composer John Philip Sousa. She overheard two men discussing the loss of a target for an act in which they shot an apple off a girl’s head; she volunteered on the spot.|$|R
60|$|The brook murmured {{below her}} and the birds sang. She heard the bees humming by. The air out here was clear of scent of fruit and hay, and it bore a drier odor, not <b>so</b> sweet. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the workmen, first those among the alfalfa, and then the men, and women, too, bending over on the vegetable-gardens. Likewise <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the gleam of peaches, apples, pears and plums--a {{colorful}} and mixed gleam, delightful to the eye.|$|R
