5|$|Hoshino {{was born}} on April 21, 1980, in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, as the younger of fraternal twin girls and the second of three children. As a child, she {{originally}} dreamed of becoming an astronaut. Hoshino confessed she was not too interested in school, often making excuses to avoid taking classes. Additionally, she added that would often practise drawing {{in the middle of}} the classes which gave her doubts when she had to erase them. She drew her first manga at twenty-one. In 1998, Hoshino moved to Tokyo. <b>She</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> bringing her mother to the city and was able to in 2006. After graduating from high school, Hoshino did not know what career should she follow as she was offered the work of joining video game companies. Ultimately, she decided to become a manga author despite her fears of the difficulty it takes.|$|E
5|$|Maria, {{like her}} mother, was likely a carrier of the {{hemophilia}} gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children <b>she</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of.</b> One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with his will, Pius' fortune {{passed on to}} Faustina. (Marcus had little need of his wife's fortune. Indeed, at his accession, Marcus transferred part of his mother's estate to his nephew, Ummius Quadratus.) Faustina was three months pregnant at her husband's accession. During the pregnancy <b>she</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> giving birth to two serpents, one fiercer than the other. On 31 August she gave birth at Lanuvium to twins: T. Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus. Aside {{from the fact that}} the twins shared Caligula's birthday, the omens were favorable, and the astrologers drew positive horoscopes for the children. The births were celebrated on the imperial coinage.|$|E

25|$|Blanka Vlašić {{was born}} on 8 November 1983 in Split, Croatia (which was then part of Yugoslavia). From a young age, she was {{involved}} in sports: her mother Venera was a seasoned amateur in basketball and cross country skiing while her father, Joško Vlašić, was an international athlete who broke the Croatian record in the decathlon. Her father brought her to the track while he practised and <b>she</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> becoming a professional sprinter. As she grew up she tried a number of sports but found that the high jump was particularly well-suited to her tall and slender frame. Vlašić shunned the idea of competing in more profitable sports, such as basketball, saying that she preferred the thrill of individual sports. She reached the international standard for a high jumper at an early age, setting a personal best of 1.80metres at fifteen years of age and quickly improving to 1.93m at sixteen.|$|E
25|$|Monáe {{was born}} in Kansas City, Kansas, where she spent her early years. She is the {{daughter}} of a janitor mother and a truck driver father, Michael Robinson Summers. <b>She</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> being a singer and a performer from a very young age, and has cited the fictional character of Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz as a musical influence. She moved to New York City to study drama at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, attending a performing arts camp called Freedom Theatre, the oldest African-American theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2001, she met OutKast's Big Boi, and then founded the Wondaland Arts Society with some like-minded young artists. She released her first EP The Audition in 2003. Although it did not place highly on the Billboard charts – reportedly only 400 physical copies were pressed – it did showcase her vocal abilities and unique Metropolis concept that would also figure in her future releases. The CD album itself is extremely rare in its original compact disc format, and as such is a valuable collector's item.|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the song comes from an epitaph on a plaque at Eva Perón's grave in the La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. The plaque was {{presented}} by the city's taxi drivers' union and roughly translates as: [...] "Don't cry for me Argentina, I remain quite near to you." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote [...] "For years I have wondered, during 'Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,' why we were not to cry. Now I understand: We need not cry because (a) Evita got everything out of life <b>she</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of,</b> and (b) Argentina should cry for itself. Even poor Juan Peron [...] should shed a tear or two; he is relegated...to {{the status of a}} 'walker,' a presentable man who adorns the arm of a rich and powerful woman as a human fashion accessory." [...] The song's lyrics are a [...] "string of meaningless platitudes" [...] according to Rice, who felt that it worked as an emotionally intense but empty speech by a [...] "megalomaniac woman" [...] trying to win the favor of the Argentines. It features the lyrics [...] "And as for fortune, and as for fame / I never invited them in / Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired / They are illusions".|$|E

2500|$|One Ojibwa {{woman from}} the far western end of Lake Superior, Oshahgushkodanaqua, who married in 1793 John Johnston, a British fur trader based in Sault St. Marie working for the North West Company, later gave an account in her old age of how she came {{to be married to}} a British writer named Anna Brownell Jameson. According to Jameson's 1838 book Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada, Oshahgushkodanaqua told her when she was 13, she {{embarked}} on her [...] "vision quest" [...] to find her guardian spirit by fasting alone in a lodge painted black on a high hill. During Oshahgushkodanaqua's [...] "vision quest": [...] "She dreamed continually of a white man, who approached her with a cup in his hand, saying [...] "Poor thing! Why are you punishing yourself? Why do you fast? Here is food for you!" [...] He was always accompanied by a dog, who looked up at her like he knew her. Also, <b>she</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> being on a high hill, which was surrounded by water, and from which she beheld many canoes full of Indians, coming to her and paying her homage; after this, {{she felt as if she}} was being carried up into the heavens, and as she looked down on the earth, she perceived it was on fire and said to herself, [...] "All my relations will be burned!", but a voice answered and said, [...] "No, they will not be destroyed, they will be saved!", and she knew it was a spirit, because the voice was not human. She fasted for ten days, during which time her grandmother brought her at intervals some water. When satisfied that she had obtained a guardian spirit in the white stranger who haunted her dreams, she returned to her father's lodge". About five years later, Oshahgushkodanaqua first met Johnston, who asked to marry her, but was refused permission by her father who did not think he wanted a long-term relationship. When Johnston returned the next year and again asked to marry Oshahgushkodanaqua, her father granted permission, but she herself declined, saying she disliked the implications of being married until death, but ultimately married under strong pressure from her father. Oshahgushkodanaqua came to embrace her marriage when she decided that Johnston was the white stranger she saw in her dreams during her vision quest. The couple stayed married for 36 years with the marriage ending with Johnston's death, and Oshahgushkodanaqua played an important role in her husband's business career. Jameson also noted Oshahgushkodanaqua was considered to be a strong woman among the Ojibwa, writing [...] "in her youth she hunted and was accounted the surest eye and fleetest foot among the women of her tribe".|$|E
