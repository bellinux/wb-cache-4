With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius, she could see clearly what she did see, and give a clear expression to what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.|$|E

500|$|Victor Lewis-Smith {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Guardian in 2005, {{thought that a}} spring onion risotto accompaniment to a pan fried seabass tasted so good {{that it would have}} been sufficient as a main course itself and was also quite pleased that crÃªpe suzette was served on a trolley for table side service. Claire Ogden visited the restaurant for the Metro newspaper shortly after it was first awarded a Michelin star in 2007. She thought that a John Dory main course was [...] "pristine", and overall thought that the star was well deserved. The only negative thing <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the experience was a toffee foam served on top of a pear granita which she described as [...] "flimsy-flavoured". It was named the best restaurant in Britain by Les Routiers later that year. The critic from the Western Mail stated in 2008 that [...] "the menu is short and to the point, with around five choices for each course. The wine list is huge, an insurmountable challenge for me but another's utopia." [...] However, he remarked that the main course was [...] "genuinely brilliant food" [...] and deserving of its Michelin star.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{described}} the recording process as challenging {{because she was}} provided with little visual aid, explaining, [...] "All I had to work off were a few sketches ... {{but it was also}} fun because it allows you to go into the depths of your imagination." [...] She also revealed that creating Rapunzel's voice was simply a process of [...] "let go". Moore was often required to re-record a single line a total of four times before the directors finally heard a version with which they were satisfied. After watching the completed film for the first time, Moore was disappointed with her own performance because she felt that her voice sounded [...] "shrill". According to composer Alan Menken, Moore's musical background made her [...] "a delight to work with". Moore found the practice of performing in character challenging in comparison to recording her own original music, explaining, [...] "I can't just be like Mandy and sing something the way that I want to necessarily, because you know, you sort of have to stick to certain guidelines." [...] She found recording [...] "When Will My Life Begin" [...] particularly difficult due to the speed at which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> certain words, and cites both Menken and discovering Rapunzel herself as a character with guiding her through the process.|$|E
