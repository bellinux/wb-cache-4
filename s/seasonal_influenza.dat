40|$|Abstract Background Influenza {{has been}} {{associated}} with a heavy burden of mortality. In tropical or subtropical regions where influenza viruses circulate in the community most of the year, it is possible that there are seasonal variations in the effects of influenza on mortality, because of periodic changes in environment and host factors as well as the frequent emergence of new antigenically drifted virus strains. In this paper we explored this <b>seasonal</b> effect of <b>influenza.</b> Methods A time-varying coefficient Poisson regression model was fitted to the weekly numbers of mortality of Hong Kong from 1996 to 2002. Excess risks associated with influenza were calculated to assess the <b>seasonal</b> effects of <b>influenza.</b> Results We demonstrated that the effects of influenza were higher in winter and late spring/early summer than other seasons. The two-peak pattern of <b>seasonal</b> effects of <b>influenza</b> was found for cardio-respiratory disease and sub-categories pneumonia and influenza, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular diseases and ischemic heart disease as well as for all-cause deaths.

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2009 pandemic, several studies were conducted to see who received influenza vaccines. [...] These studies show that whites {{are much more likely to}} be vaccinated for <b>seasonal</b> <b>influenza</b> and for the H1N1 strain than African Americans [...] This could be due to several factors. [...] Historically, there has been mistrust of vaccines and of the medical community from African Americans. [...] Many African Americans do not believe vaccines or doctors to be effective. [...] This mistrust stems from the exploitation of the African American communities during studies like the Tuskegee study. [...] Additionally, vaccines are typically administered in clinics, hospitals, or doctor’s offices. [...] Many people of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive vaccinations because they do not have health insurance.|$|E

2500|$|There are two serious {{technical}} {{problems associated with}} the development of a vaccine against H5N1. The first problem is this: <b>seasonal</b> <b>influenza</b> vaccines require a single injection of 15 μg haemagluttinin in order to give protection; H5 seems to evoke only a weak immune response and a large multicentre trial found that two injections of 90µg H5 given 28 days apart provided protection in only 54% of people [...] Even if it is considered that 54% is an acceptable level of protection, the world is currently capable of producing only 900million doses at a strength of 15 μg (assuming that all production were immediately converted to manufacturing H5 vaccine); if two injections of 90 μg are needed then this capacity drops to only 70million [...] [...] Trials using adjuvants such as alum, AS03, AS04 or MF59 to try and lower the dose of vaccine are urgently needed. [...] The second problem is this: there are two circulating clades of virus, clade 1 is the virus originally isolated in Vietnam, clade 2 is the virus isolated in Indonesia. Vaccine research has mostly been focused on clade 1 viruses, but the clade 2 virus is antigenically distinct and a clade 1 vaccine will probably not protect against a pandemic caused by clade 2 virus.|$|E
2500|$|According to a {{three months}} study coordinated by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Research Centre that was {{published}} in the New England Journal of Medicine, up to 20 per cent of intensive care unit(ICU) beds overall were occupied by swine flu patients {{at the height of the}} pandemic in July. In New Zealand hospitals, about 25 per cent of all ICU activity was pandemic related and about 12 per cent of patients hospitalised with swine flu were admitted to ICU. The surge of patients with H1N1 influenza placed substantial strain on staff and resources, hospitals were stretched to the very limit of resources and were at the point where possible alternatives had to be considered. Unlike <b>seasonal</b> <b>influenza</b> strains, which tend to hit elderly people and those of severe underlying health problems more heavily, many of those who became critically ill with the swine flu were babies and middle-aged people, pregnant women, the obese, Pacific Islanders, Maori and Aboriginal patients. Rates of severe illness among Pacific people were seven times higher than the average, while those of Maori were twice as high. Overall, about one-third of patients who was admitted to an ICU because of swine flu had no underlying health problem. The first batch of swine flu vaccine arrived in the country in September. Currently only frontline health workers were in line to get the vaccine, but the Health Ministry is considering on widening access to include other [...] "at risk" [...] groups.|$|E
5000|$|There are no {{evidence-based}} {{guidelines to}} guide {{the use of these}} stockpiled drugs, and plans are based on assumed similarities to <b>seasonal</b> <b>influenza.</b> The most common antivirals are neuraminidase inhibitors, which, if begun during the first 48 hours after symptoms appear, will reduce the duration of <b>seasonal</b> <b>influenza</b> by about one day. Taken before symptoms appear, it may prevent disease in about three-quarters of people treated prophylactically. [...] Currently, this is recommended in institutionalized elderly people and other high-risk groups as a form of post-exposure prophylaxis during <b>seasonal</b> <b>influenza</b> outbreaks. [...] However, since pandemic influenza differs somewhat from normal <b>seasonal</b> <b>influenza,</b> {{it is not clear that}} these drugs will prove either safe or effective for their intended purpose.|$|E

Patient demographics, clinical manifestations and neurologic outcomes were reviewed. A total of 1, 389 children were diagnosed with influenza A H 1 N 1 by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Of these, 23 (1. 7 %) patients had neurologic involvement. Their mean age was 5. 9 ± 3. 6 yr (range, 6 months to 11 yr) and 16 (69. 9 %) were boys. None of the 23 patients had been vaccinated for influenza A H 1 N 1 and <b>seasonal</b> <b>influenzas.</b> Twenty-two of the 23 patients presented with seizures. Clinical features included febrile convulsion (n = 19), afebrile convulsion (n = 1), aseptic meningitis (n = 1), encephalopathy (n = 1), and acute necrotizing encephalopathy (n = 1). They all were treated with Oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days immediately after nasal and throat swab testing. Twenty-one of the subjects recovered fully, but the youngest two infants experienced severe neurological sequelae.

40|$|Background: The {{complexity}} of <b>influenza</b> <b>seasonal</b> {{patterns in the}} inter-tropical zone impedes the establishment of effective routine immunization programs. China is a climatologically and economically diverse country, which has yet to establish a national influenza vaccination program. Here we characterize the diversity of influenza seasonality in China and make recommendations to guide future vaccination programs. Methods and Findings: We compiled weekly reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza A and B infections from sentinel hospitals in cities representing 30 Chinese provinces, 2005 – 2011, and data on population demographics, mobility patterns, socio-economic, and climate factors. We applied linear regression models with harmonic terms to estimate <b>influenza</b> <b>seasonal</b> characteristics, including the amplitude of annual and semi-annual periodicities, their ratio, and peak timing. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling and hierarchical clustering were used to identify predictors of <b>influenza</b> <b>seasonal</b> characteristics and define epidemiologically-relevant regions. The annual periodicity of influenza A epidemics increased with latitude (mean amplitude of annual cycle standardized by mean incidence, 140 % [95 % CI 128 %– 151 %] in the north versus 37 % [95 % CI 27 %– 47 %] in the south, p, 0. 0001). Epidemics peaked in January–February in Northern China (latitude $ 33 uN) and April–June in southernmost regions (latitude, 27 uN).

40|$|ABSTRACT Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) viruses of the H 5 N 1 subtype are genetically highly variable and have diver-sified into multiple phylogenetic clades {{over the past}} decade. Antigenic drift is a well-studied phenomenon for <b>seasonal</b> human <b>influenza</b> viruses, but much less {{is known about the}} antigenic evolution of HPAI H 5 N 1 viruses that circulate in poultry. In this study, we focused on HPAI H 5 N 1 viruses that are enzootic to Indonesia. We selected representative viruses from genetically dis-tinct lineages that are currently circulating and determined their antigenic properties by hemagglutination inhibition assays. At least six antigenic variants have circulated between 2003, when H 5 N 1 clade 2. 1 viruses were first detected in Indonesia, and 2011. During this period, multiple antigenic variants cocirculated in the same geographic regions. Mutant viruses were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis to represent each of the circulating antigenic variants, revealing that antigenic differences between clade 2. 1 viruses were due to only one or very few amino acid substitutions immediately adjacent to the receptor binding site. Antigenic variants of H 5 N 1 virus evaded recognition by both ferret and chicken antibodies.
