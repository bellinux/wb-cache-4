40|$|Abstract Flexibility <b>and</b> <b>portability</b> are {{important}} concerns for productive empirical performance evaluation. We claim that these features are best supported by robust instrumentation and measurement strategies, and their integration. Using the TAU performance system as an exemplar performance toolkit, {{a case study}} in performance evaluation is considered. Our goal is both to highlight flexibility <b>and</b> <b>portability</b> requirements <b>and</b> to consider how instrumentation and measurement techniques can address them. The main contribution of the paper is methodological, in its advocation of a guiding principle for tool development and enhancement. Recent advancements in the TAU system are described from this perspective. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Power {{consumption}} <b>and</b> <b>portability</b> {{issues are}} becoming increasingly significant in embedded system architectures. Therefore, {{it is important that}} chip architects and integrated circuit designers focus on power <b>and</b> <b>portability,</b> they must also be conscious of choosing the right set of parameters for an embedded processor. An evolutionary approach to configure the parameters of an embedded processor can be used to address these issues. From a given set of parameters the design space is explored using a simple genetic algorithm. This paper investigates the sensitivity of these parameters as they change during the process of the genetic algorithm. ...|$|R
