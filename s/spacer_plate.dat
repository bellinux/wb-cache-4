40|$|The Timesaver belt {{grinding}} machine {{has been selected}} by the Atlas collaboration for deburring the master and <b>spacer</b> <b>plates</b> after die stamping and laser cutting, respectively. However, the question has been raised {{as to whether or}} not the plates are sufficiently clean after going through the Timesaver machine to immediately be glued into a submodule assembly. This would greatly enhance the production of submodules because the task of cleaning individual master and <b>spacer</b> <b>plates</b> is labor intensive and time consuming as well as raises environmental issues with the detergent that is used. In order to investigate the possibility of using the Timesaver process to clean the plates as well as debur them, several plates were run through the machine and their cleanliness inspected before and after. In addition, several glue samples were subjected to the same process, glued, and then pulled apart in an attempt to gauge the cleanliness of the plates. From this series of tests it can be concluded that the wet Timesaver machine can adequately prepare the surface of the master and <b>spacer</b> <b>plates</b> as well as clean the plates for gluing. The machine was able to adequately remove all of the oil and grime from the test plates. Also, from the single test on the dry machine it appears that significant cleaning will be required to adequately clean the plates before gluing in order to remove the remaining grit...|$|R

50|$|The Pontiac Excitement 400 {{was held}} on February 25 at Richmond International Raceway. Ricky Rudd won the pole. Mark Martin won the race, only to lose 46 {{championship}} points after NASCAR officials discovered a somewhat oversized carburetor <b>spacer</b> <b>plate</b> in his car. This would ultimately become {{a key factor in}} determining the 1990 championship. This also may be the coldest race in NASCAR history. The temperature was in the mid-20's with winds gusting to 41 MPH generating a wind chill of about 5 degrees.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the second}} {{race of the}} 1990 season, Mark Martin wins, but the car {{was found to have}} an illegal {{carburetor}} spacer. NASCAR found the spacer was 2½ inches tall, a half-inch more than allowed. Martin kept the victory, but was fined $40,000 (at record at the time), and was docked 46 points. At season's end, Martin lost the championship by a mere 26 points to Dale Earnhardt, with the penalty representing the deciding margin. Later, it was admitted that the <b>spacer</b> <b>plate</b> was technically not illegal, and did not enhance the car's performance, but actually fell within a [...] "gray area" [...] of the rulebook.

40|$|The project {{contains}} a force {{analysis of the}} {{vertical axis wind turbine}} Lucia's supporting arms and a measuring device to experimentally measure the forces is made. The forces between the supporting arms and the tower are calculated theoretically and then simulated by a computere. A measuring devise is then designed to measure the forces experimentally. The forces acting on the attachment between the supporting arms and the tower is primarily the centripetal force, gravitational force and the aerodynamic forces on the rotor wings. The maximum forces were theoretically calculated and is 13. 38 kN along the x-axis, - 0. 25 kN along the y-axis and then 0. 5 kN along the z-axis. The axis are acording to a rotational reference system where the x-axis runs along the supporting arm and the y-axis runs along the axis of rotation. The maximum torque that occurs is 0. 53 kNm along the y-axis and 1. 29 kNm along the z-axis. The size of the forces have been confirmed with a deviation of up to 1. 8 % in the simulation using SolidWorks 2010. For the experimental measurements a measuring device has been developed which consists of S-load cells with wave indicator and transmitter, an attachment for the measuring equipment and distanceplates to stabilize the rotor. S-load cells, wave indicator and transmitter were ordered and drawings for the attachment of the measuring equipment and <b>spacer</b> <b>plates</b> was done. The eigenfrequencies and the stress have been investigated for the parts. The eigenfrequencies for the wind turbine was estimated to decline up to 13 % when the measuring device was mounted and the lowest Factor of Safety was 1. 67. Before the attachment of the measuring device and the <b>spacer</b> <b>plates</b> can be ordered the attachment of the supporting arms, how the loadcells should be attached to the device and the safety margins need to be examined. ...|$|R

5000|$|It was {{admitted}} {{later that the}} <b>spacer</b> <b>plate</b> was actually not oversized and not technically illegal. The part was bolted on instead of welded on, thus landing in the [...] "gray area" [...] of NASCAR rules. Dale Earnhardt and his car owner, Richard Childress, who {{finished second in the}} race, protested the result because of the findings of the post-race inspection. NASCAR eventually ruled that Martin and car owner Jack Roush would keep the victory, but would lose 46 points {{as a result of the}} infraction. This has spawned many years of speculation that NASCAR was biased toward Earnhardt, the eventual 7-time champion, but given that the race was only the second of the season, (27 races still remained), neither Earnhardt, Martin, their car owners, or NASCAR, could have foreseen at the time that the penalty would ultimately make up the difference in the points championship at the conclusion of the season.|$|E

The approach we are employing is to assemble experimental hardware that mimic realistic engine geometries while enabling optical access. For example, we are using multi-cylinder engine heads or one-cylinder versions of production heads mated to one-cylinder engine blocks. Optical access is then obtained through a periscope in an exhaust valve, quartz windows in the piston crown, windows in <b>spacer</b> <b>plates</b> just below the head, or quartz cylinder liners.

40|$|Various {{methods have}} been {{explored}} for the fabrication of the large trapezoidal plates used {{in the construction of}} the Tile-Cal hadronic calorimeter for ATLAS. The options include die stamping, laser cutting, waterjet cutting, plasma arc cutting, and a combination of machining and laser cutting. Very early in the program, the Argonne group began investigating the possibility of die stamping the master plates. At that time it was felt that two dies would be necessary to achieve the accuracy required. Quotations were received for dies for both the master and <b>spacer</b> <b>plates.</b> Concern was expressed by many members of the collaboration that due to the very precise tolerances required, die stamping, using standard dies, would not be adequate. Fine blanking techniques were felt to be adequate, but were cost prohibitive. Two methods were finally used for the initial cutting of prototype plates, laser cutting and die stamping. Only the die stamping, will be reviewed here...|$|R
40|$|This project aims to find {{correlations}} between various flow parameters and liquid refrigerant flow distribution within a horizontal manifold supplying two-phase R 134 a downward into fifteen aluminum microchannels. Liquid flow rates, system pressures, and refrigerant temperatures are recorded. Prior to this project, similar experiments were conducted using an identical manifold setup with water/air as the working fluid. Similarities {{and differences between}} the two working fluids are discussed. During refrigerant testing, inlet flow rates are varied between 15 g/s and 35 g/s. Inlet qualities vary between 0 % and 35 %. Manifold flow path geometry is varied by using three <b>spacer</b> <b>plates</b> of different thickness. Increasing mass flux at the entrance of the manifold improves liquid distribution through the microchannels. At sufficiently high mass fluxes, increasing quality at the entrance also improves liquid distribution. The distance between the manifold inlet and the array of microchannel tubes also has a large effect on liquid distribution. Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Project 13...|$|R

40|$|An {{articulated}} tang in {{clevis joint}} for incorporation in newly manufactured conventional strap-on orthotic knee devices or for replacing such joints in conventional strap-on orthotic knee devices is discussed. The instant tang in clevis joint allows the user {{the freedom to}} extend and bend the knee normally when no load (weight) {{is applied to the}} knee and to automatically lock the knee when the user transfers weight to the knee, thus preventing a damaged knee from bending uncontrollably when weight is applied to the knee. The tang in clevis joint of the present invention includes first and second clevis plates, a tang assembly and a <b>spacer</b> <b>plate</b> secured between the clevis plates. Each clevis plate includes a bevelled serrated upper section. A bevelled shoe is secured to the tank in close proximity to the bevelled serrated upper section of the clevis plates. A coiled spring mounted within an oblong bore of the tang normally urges the shoes secured to the tang out of engagement with the serrated upper section of each clevic plate to allow rotation of the tang relative to the clevis plate. When weight is applied to the joint, the load compresses the coiled spring, the serrations on each clevis plate dig into the bevelled shoes secured to the tang to prevent relative movement between the tang and clevis plates.

40|$|Accordion {{patterns}} {{are widely used}} for deployable shelters, due to their simple construction, elegant deployment mechanism, and folded plate form with an inherent structural efficiency. This paper proposes two new accordion-type shelters that use modified geometries to improve on the structural stability and stiffness of the typical accordion form. The first shelter is termed a distributed frame accordion shelter and is generated by separating fully folded accordion frames between <b>spacer</b> <b>plates</b> aligned with the transverse direction. A transverse stiffness and increased flexural rigidity can therefore be achieved while maintaining a nonzero floor area. The second shelter is termed a diamond wall accordion shelter and is generated by inserting secondary wall elements that increase wall sectional depth and counteract the coupled rotational-transverse displacements at accordion roof–wall junctions. For both shelter types, a geometric parameterization and a full-scale prototype are presented. Good correlation is seen between the designed and constructed surfaces. A numerical investigation also shows that the new forms have substantially increased flexural rigidities compared to the typical accordion for...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} work, {{numerical}} simulations and experiments of an 8 × 8 square array of heater rods within an aluminum enclosure have been performed. This geometry represents the region inside the channel of a {{boiling water reactor}} (BWR) fuel assembly between two consecutive <b>spacer</b> <b>plates.</b> The simulation model and the experimental apparatus can be oriented horizontally or vertically, to represent transport or storage configurations. The interior void is filled with air at ambient pressure conditions. All rods dissipate at the same heating rate. In the experiment, this is controlled using a variable power supply.

40|$|Abstract Background Model {{surgery is}} an {{integral}} part of the planning procedure in orthognathic surgery. Most concepts comprise cutting the dental cast off its socket. The standardized <b>spacer</b> <b>plates</b> of the KD-MMS provide for a non-destructive, reversible and reproducible means of maxillary and/or mandibular plaster cast separation. Methods In the course of development of the system various articulator types were evaluated with regard to their capability to provide a means of realizing the concepts comprised of the KD-MMS. Special attention was dedicated to the ability to perform three-dimensional displacements without cutting of plaster casts. Various utilities were developed to facilitate maxillary displacement in accordance to the planning. Objectives of this development comprised the ability to implement the values established in the course of two-dimensional ceph planning. Results The system - KD-MMS comprises a set of hardware components as well as a defined procedure. Essential hardware components are red spacer and blue mounting plates. The blue mounting plates replace the standard yellow SAM mounting elements. The red spacers provide for a defined leeway of 8 mm for three-dimensional movements. The non-destructive approach of the KD-MMS makes it possible to conduct different model surgeries with the same plaster casts as well as to restore the initial, pre-surgical situation at any time. Thereby, surgical protocol generation and gnathologic splint construction are facilitated. Conclusions The KD-MMS hardware components in conjunction with the defined procedures are capable of increasing efficiency and accuracy of model surgery and splint construction. In cases where different surgical approaches need to be evaluated in the course of model surgery, a significant reduction of chair time may be achieved. </p...|$|R
