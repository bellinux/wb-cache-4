5|$|As he {{was unable}} to travel during 1916, Kropotkin found himself in {{frequent}} correspondence with others, including Jean Grave, who visited Kropotkin from France with his wife. Together, they discussed the war and Kropotkin's firm support for it. At Kropotkin's suggestion {{that he would like to}} have been a combatant were he younger, Grave suggested publishing a document urging anarchists to support the war effort on the side of the Allied Powers. Initially hesitant, due to his personal inability to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> active duty, Kropotkin was eventually persuaded by Grave.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Dean left ATP and became the head of the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), the organisation that provided entertainment to the British Armed Forces. Over the course of five months Formby requested to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> ENSA, but was denied; Dean relented in February 1940, and Formby was signed on a fixed salary of £10 per week, although he still remained under contact to ATP. He undertook his first tour in France in March, where he performed for members of the British Expeditionary Force.|$|E

50|$|The 2007 {{marathon}} {{was also}} a representative selection race of the 2007 World Championships in Athletics in Osaka. The total number of participants was set at 30,000.

50|$|The Palestine {{marathon}} in 2014 {{took place}} Friday April 11, 2014.

One of the runners was the famous photographer Jacob Holdt.|$|R
5|$|He {{became a}} United States citizen in 1946 after {{serving in the}} United States Army and {{achieving}} the rank of sergeant. In so doing, he lost his Canadian citizenship, as Canadian law prior to 1977 limited dual citizenship. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 he attempted to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> active duty with the army's flying service (the United States Air Force was not formed until 1947), but was turned down for being too old. He therefore spent World War II in the United States Army and among his duty stations was Fort Lewis, located in Tacoma, Washington.|$|E
5|$|The Legion spurred {{several million}} Roman Catholics across the U.S. to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the boycott, {{allowing}} local religious leaders {{to determine which}} films to protest. Conservative Protestants tended to support much of the crackdown, particularly in the South, where anything relating {{to the state of}} race relations or miscegenation could not be portrayed. Although the Central Conference of American Rabbis joined in the protest, it was an uneasy alliance given the heavy presence of Jewish studio executives and producers, which, it was felt had inspired {{at least some of the}} vitriol from the Catholic groups.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} its release in August 2001, Funcom began {{offering}} free trial subscriptions, now common practice for other {{games in the}} MMOG genre. New players were able to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> accounts that remained free for {{a limited number of}} days. This required them to supply some personal information, including a credit card number. After their trial period, players could either cancel their accounts, or keep them to continue playing the game at the cost of the monthly subscription fee.|$|E

5|$|All trips {{made with}} a SmarTrip card, with the {{exception}} of bus transfers and passes, are charged as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several trips in one day, or many trips, or many short trips, in a seven-day period or calendar month; however, SmarTrip users must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards or <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> an autoload of the pass in advance. This is in contrast to the Oyster card system on the London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never pay more than the cost of a one-day pass each day.|$|E
5|$|The game went gold in {{the middle}} of October 2007. A demo was then {{released}} on November 8, 2007 on the PlayStation Network before its final release on November 19 in North America, December 6 in Australia, and December 7 in Europe. The demo was first placed on the North American store, and was initially region-locked such that it would only play on a North American PS3. However, this was later confirmed as a mistake, as the developers were apparently unaware that people from different regions could <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> a North American account and download the demo; a region-free demo was released soon after.|$|E
5|$|Akeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old {{spelling}} enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle School, {{a predominantly}} black school in South Los Angeles. She {{lives with her}} widowed mother Tanya, her older sister Kiana, her older brothers Devon and Terrence, and her infant niece. Her principal Mr. Welch suggests that she <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling Bee. She follows his advice and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she {{is good enough to}} compete in the National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she qualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old Mexican American boy and fellow speller. Javier invites her to join the spelling club at his Woodland Hills middle school.|$|E

5|$|More than 9.2 {{million people}} {{signed up for}} care on the {{national}} exchange (healthcare.gov) for 2017, down some 400,000 from 2016. This decline was due primarily to the election of President Trump, who pulled advertising encouraging people to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> coverage, issued an executive order that attempts to eliminate the mandate, and has created significant uncertainty {{about the future of}} the ACA. Enrollments had been running ahead of 2016 prior to President Obama leaving office, with 9.8 million expected to sign-up, so President Trump's actions potentially cost about 600,000 national enrollments (i.e., 9.8 million expected − 9.2 million actual = 0.6 million impact). Of the 9.2 million, 3.0 million were new customers and 6.2 million were returning. The 9.2 million excludes the 11 states that run their own exchanges, which have signed up around 3 million additional people. These figures also exclude the additional coverage due to the Medicaid expansion, which covers another approximately 10 million persons, as described in the impact section above.|$|E
5|$|Blizzard {{posted a}} release {{date for the}} game's first beta of Summer 2009, but failed to release a beta during that time. Since May 6, 2009, it was {{possible}} to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the beta phase of the game. In November 2009, the game's producer Chris Sigaty confirmed there would be no public beta for the game taking place in 2009 but assured fans that it would happen next year. In February 2010, Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime announced that a closed beta would open later that month. On February 17, 2010, StarCraft II began closed beta testing, as promised. The beta was expected to last for 3–5 months. Beta keys for the initial release were sold on eBay for prices as high as $400. Blizzard also released a map editor for the beta as part of Patch 9. According to the company, they had planned to release a major content patch towards the end of beta testing. As of July 23, 2010, eighteen patches had been released for the beta (only seventeen on European servers), including a patch which provided access to the Galaxy map editor. On May 12, 2010 Blizzard released the beta client for computers running Mac OS X, for the users who had signed up. On May 17, 2010, Blizzard announced that {{the first phase of the}} beta test would be coming to an end in all regions on May 31, but it was later extended to June 7. The second phase began on July 7, 2010, and ended on July 19, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{titles and}} styling of Her Excellency The Rev. Sir Doctor Stephen Tyrone Mos Def Colbert, D.F.A., Heavyweight Champion of the World✱✱ {{featuring}} Flo Rida La Premiere Dame De France are mostly for comedic reasons. Colbert became an ordained minister on June 2, 2011, granting himself {{the title of}} Reverend. Colbert was mock-knighted by Queen Noor of Jordan on April 7, 2009, bestowing him with the title of Sir. He was granted an honorary doctorate of fine arts by Knox College in 2006, giving him the title of Doctor {{and use of the}} suffix D.F.A. (Doctor of Fine Arts). This title is featured regularly during his segments Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, DFA. Yasiin Bey gave Colbert the use of his stage name Mos Def on October 5, 2011. Colbert was set to interview Mike Tyson on July 23, 2013. Tyson did not appear which led Colbert to declare himself Heavy Weight Champion of the World and grant himself use of the title. The large asterisk in the title is to denote that he did not defeat Tyson in a boxing match. The suffix featuring Flo Rida was added during the segment I tried to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> Obamacare on October 23, 2013, where his name on the ACA form said featuring Flo Rida. Her Excellency was added to the title as Colbert was seated next to Michelle Obama at the White House state dinner in February 2014, in which the President of France François Hollande was not accompanied by a partner. Because it is customary that the first lady of a visiting nation is seated next to the First Lady of the United States, Colbert proclaimed himself First Lady of France on February 12, 2014.|$|E
