The structure of the lines present in the spectrum of the vibrations measured on a non-faulty planetary <b>gear</b> <b>transmission,</b> with a sensor mounted on the outer part of the ring gear, is strictly related to the geometry of the transmission. Hence, different spectral patterns can be found for different planetary <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions.</b> In this work, a vibration model for a single-stage planetary <b>gear</b> <b>transmission</b> is presented to explain this phenomenon. The model is developed in the time domain and analyzed in the frequency domain by using the Fourier transform. It is shown that some planetary <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions,</b> with different geometries, present similar spectral structures. Based on this, a classification of planetary <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions</b> in four groups is proposed. The spectral characteristics of the vibrations of each group are presented. The classification allows for a fast estimation of the expected spectral pattern of the vibrations of any single-stage planetary <b>gear</b> <b>transmission.</b> Through this, contribution is expected {{in order to increase}} the effectiveness of vibration-based condition monitoring in planetary <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions...</b>|$|R

40|$|One of {{the central}} {{problems}} in manufacturing gears is to lengthen the life and increase the load capacity of transmissions and drive elements made from lightweight materials. Using lighter materials significantly reduces the moment of inertia, meaning higher dynamics can be achieved. In {{the framework of the}} joint project LEZABS ("Lightweight lubricant-free or low lubricant <b>gear</b> <b>transmission</b> through DLC coatings") a <b>gear</b> <b>transmission</b> with backlash for a circular saw of the firm Metabowerke GmbH & Co. and a Harmonic Drive <b>gear</b> <b>transmission</b> free of play that is suitable for positioning changes in robots or machine tools were investigated. Int both applications traditional steels are being replaced with lighter, easier to work materials. Aluminium and titanium alloys are being investigated for the play-free <b>transmission</b> <b>gears,</b> with sintered steels and ETG 100 for the <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions</b> with backlash. Variations of coatings were checked in extensive wear and application-orientated model tests. The laboratory results were transferred to realistic <b>gear</b> <b>transmission</b> elements. In order to maintain optimal total power output, calculations and simulations to improve gear geometry and the meshing of the gears were carried out. As the result of all this development work METABO experienced a tool life incrase from 50 to 300 hours for their circular saw with the same size and load. Production costs could be held steady by substituting the use of an a-C:H coating for a hardening process, {{while at the same time}} improving toothing quality.

The developed numerical model is benchmarked with results from experimental tests at NASA Lewis Research Center. The modal synthesis approach is used to develop the global transient vibration analysis procedure used in the model. Modal dynamic characteristics of the rotor-gear-bearing system are calculated by the matrix transfer method while those of the gear box are evaluated by the finite element method (NASTRAN). A three-dimensional, axial-lateral coupled bearing model is used to couple the rotor vibrations with the gear box motion. The vibrations between the individual rotor systems are coupled through the nonlinear gear mesh interactions. The global equations of motion are solved in modal coordinates and the transient vibration of the system is evaluated by a variable time-stepping integration scheme.
