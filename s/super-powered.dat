5|$|Prime {{decides to}} send Verity {{and her two}} friends Hunter and Jimmy home. Ironhide and Sunstreaker are given this task, but the Machination strikes and {{seemingly}} destroy Sunstreaker and Hunter. Ratchet realizes that Sunstreaker's corpse is a fake and that he and Hunter have simply been kidnapped. Megatron uses the Ore-13 {{to give him the}} rare ability of mass-displacement to transform into an earthen pistol, and decides to stay on Earth to escalate tensions, using a human facsimile to stir up a war between the United States and El Jira. The Autobots, with newly arrived allies, battle the Decepticons in the Russian breakaway state of Brasnya where the <b>super-powered</b> Megatron beats Prime to near death. Prime manages to recover and puts Megatron to flight. However, the facsimile Georgi Koska arrives dead at the Autobot base.|$|E
5|$|The 3D cutscenes were {{improved}} with motion capture technology {{to create a}} more cinematic experience. The stylized comic-like cut scenes from the first game carried over into the sequel, though they were reserved for bigger moments in the game. The 3D cutscenes were used to tell the story going on in the moment, while the comic-like cutscenes were used to tell a large piece of the story in a short amount of time. In addition to the cut scenes, the moral element of the original also transferred to the sequel. When incorporating the player's Karma decisions from the first game into the second, it was found challenging to balance the effects of importing saves from the original Infamous and keeping the game interesting for those who did not. The melee combat in the game was redesigned from the original with finishing moves being added. A large focus on the melee combat was the presentation, which was meant to make the player feel <b>super-powered.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the Ultimate Marvel universe, the Black Knight (real name Alex) is {{a member}} of the would-be superhero team the Defenders. He is long-haired, bearded, and out-of-shape, with a piece of armor, and resembles a LARP'er. He later shows up in , {{alongside}} the <b>super-powered</b> Defenders from a mysterious source.|$|E
25|$|Though Superboy {{encounters}} few <b>super-powered</b> peers on Earth, {{he occasionally}} befriends teens living on other worlds that have superpowers. Not until Cosmic Boy, Saturn Girl, and Lightning Lad {{come into the}} past to recruit him for the thirtieth-century Legion of Super-Heroes does Superboy find a group of <b>super-powered</b> friends with whom he regularly interacts. Superboy's career in fact is {{the inspiration for the}} formation of the Legion. Throughout his teenage years, Superboy travels to the future under his own power to join the Legion in fighting threats to Earth and the United Planets, to which Earth belongs. Superboy becomes a core member of the Legion during two extended, full membership stints in the Legion, including two terms as Deputy Leader. Through the Legion, Superboy also regularly meets with his cousin Kara, Supergirl, but because of telepathic hypnotism employed by Saturn Girl, Superboy never remembers Kara, or any other information relating to his future career as Superman or the future of his family and friends, when he returns to his normal, 20th-century era.|$|E
25|$|In {{the twelfth}} {{issue of the}} series, Larsen is {{now a member of}} the Front Men, a team of <b>super-powered</b> guards working for Mister Somebody Enterprises. His team is working to {{discredit}} the Doom Patrol, having been coached in various ways on how to make the heroes look bad for the cameras. Unknown to the Front Men, 'Mister Somebody' has rigged their uniforms to deliver fatal blows in ways that make it seem as if the Doom Patrol killed them intentionally.|$|E
25|$|Since their marriage, Clark and Lois {{continue}} {{to be one of}} the strongest relationships in comics. In 2006, the couple took the 'next step' in adopting a newly arrived Kryptonian boy, who they named Chris Kent. The boy is later discovered to be the son of Jor-El's foe, General Zod. Although initially uneasy about raising a <b>super-powered</b> child, Lois has shown immense aptitude of being 'Mommy Lois'. Following a devastating battle with Zod, Chris sacrificed himself to seal the Phantom Zone rift, trapping himself inside with Zod's forces, leaving Lois without her son.|$|E
25|$|Four {{years after}} his debut, Superboy became only the sixth DC superhero to receive his own comic book when Superboy No. 1 (Mar–Apr 1949) was published. The series became the first new DC superhero title to succeed since World War II. Superboy saw the debuts of the first Superbaby story, (about Clark's adventures as a <b>super-powered</b> toddler), and of Clark's two closest friends: Lana Lang, who {{also serves as a}} romantic {{interest}} for Superboy; and Pete Ross, who later discovers and helps protect Clark's secret identity. Other notable stories to appear in Superboy include the story of the first Bizarro and the first appearances of Legion of Super-Heroes members Mon-El and Ultra Boy.|$|E
25|$|Excelsior was {{a support}} group {{consisting}} of former teenage superheroes from defunct Marvel comic series (though one of their members - Lightspeed - was and remains a cast member of a financially and critically successful series of Power Pack books aimed at younger readers). Excelsior was founded by Mickey Musashi (Turbo of the New Warriors) and Phil Urich (the heroic former Green Goblin), and the group's stated goals were to help fellow/former teenage superheroes to adjust to normal lives and dissuade other <b>super-powered</b> teenagers from becoming heroes, though this rationale (and by extension the team themselves) was made redundant {{by the events of}} Civil War (in which it became a legal requirement for all U.S. resident superheroes in the Marvel universe to register with the United States government for training, or face imprisonment).|$|E
25|$|When Franklin Richards {{was kidnapped}} by Onslaught, Doom joined the Fantastic Four, Avengers and the X-Men to battle Onslaught in Central Park. An enraged Hulk {{was able to}} crack open Onslaught's shell. However, Onslaught {{remained}} as pure psionic energy, separated Hulk and Banner, planning to spread across the planet. Thor Odinson plunged into Onslaught, trying to contain him. The Fantastic Four, {{the majority of the}} Avengers, and the Hulk-less Banner followed in short order, with Doom being forced to join the sacrifice when Iron Man tackled the villain into the energy mass. Thanks to this sacrifice, the X-Men finally managed to destroy Onslaught. Doom, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers and Banner were believed dead but were instead saved by Franklin, who created a pocket dimension called Counter-Earth to keep them safe. After several months away, the missing heroes returned from Counter-Earth, except for Doom, who remained there for a time. Doom uncovers the secret power {{at the heart of the}} planet, an avatar of his arch-foe Reed Richards' son, Franklin, the <b>super-powered</b> youth who conjured this globe and left a bit of himself behind to guide it from within. Doom managed to convince the little boy to relinquish control of this world with little more than a few errant promises of a better life.|$|E
500|$|Although Roth, Gough and Millar {{knew the}} show would be action-oriented, {{they wanted to}} reach 7th Heavens [...] "middle America iconography". To create atmosphere, the team decided the meteor shower {{bringing}} Clark to Earth would be the ironic foundation of the show. The primary source of his life on Earth and the <b>super-powered</b> beings Clark must fight, it would take away {{the parents of the}} girl he loves and start Lex Luthor down a dark path. Roth appreciated Clark's conflict in dealing with the fact that his arrival caused so much pain.|$|E
500|$|Naughty Dog {{consciously}} avoided action game stereotypes, including <b>super-powered</b> {{heroes and}} overly sexualized female characters. They included a large {{cast of characters}} {{to ensure that the}} story was character-driven rather than story-driven. Co-president of Naughty Dog Evan Wells stated, [...] "I honestly think that the key element, {{if you really want to}} boil it down, is characters. People will tell a story, but if it's not a character-driven plot then you are missing something." [...] Many of these characters were specifically designed to highlight different facets of Nathan Drake's personality.|$|E
500|$|... "Pilot" [...] is {{the pilot}} and first episode of the first season of the American {{television}} series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson {{and his team of}} S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they investigate a <b>super-powered</b> man and a hacktivist group. It is the first television episode to be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by series creators Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, and Maurissa Tancharoen, and was directed by Joss Whedon.|$|E
500|$|Clark Gregg reprises {{his role}} as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. Louis Ozawa Changchien portrays the <b>super-powered</b> man, while Ruth Negga is {{introduced}} as Raina—the titular [...] "girl in the flower dress". In addition, to support the episode's Hong Kong setting, actor Tzi Ma appears in a guest role as a Hong Kong agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., and Jeremy Zuckerman contributed performances on Chinese instruments for the musical score. The episode brings back elements from the series' pilot, and features ties to the MCU films.|$|E
500|$|Griesemer {{said that}} a {{recurring}} theme throughout Infamous games {{that they wanted to}} continue with Second Son was the idea of [...] "modern elemental powers", variations on commonplace powers drawn from the game world. Producer Brian Fleming found that the graphical effects helped to inform players of the amount of power Delsin possesses. [...] "This is a game about super powers, so for us, the way the effects look tells you a lot about how you're playing the game", he explained. Fox considered that the game world's resemblance to Seattle helped the superpower elements feel authentic. [...] "Because we have that sweet foundation of plausibility, you buy into the <b>super-powered</b> element", he explained.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Writing for The A.V. Club, critic Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with an A-, explaining {{he thought the}} episode worked well because the monster was [...] "cool," [...] the newly <b>super-powered</b> Olivia was [...] "intriguing," [...] and the little episode quirks (such as a typewriter communicating messages) helped to give Fringe [...] "its own flavor". Ramsey Isler from IGN rated the episode 8.1/10, writing that despite its [...] "relative insignificance" [...] at explaining more show mythology, it [...] "was still very well done, creepy as hell, and pretty entertaining". He also praised the main actors' performances, but wished Fringe would answer more questions and produce less [...] "monster-of-the-week" [...] episodes.|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, Bludgeon {{returns to}} Cybertron and reawakens Thunderwing, believing that Thunderwing's {{destruction}} of planets will appease and revitalize {{the spirit of}} Cybertron. After Nebulos is razed, Bludgeon is driven insane by a failed bonding attempt and Thunderwing is taken down by Optimus Prime. [...] Thunderwing's corpse is placed under guard. Prime sets a course for Earth as he learns vague details of Regenesis, heavily suspicious due to Ironhide's call regarding Starscream breaking into siege mode. Megatron already takes action, exploring the Nebraska base. Having anticipated Megatron's course of action, Starscream imbues himself with [...] "ore-13 resin" [...] and battles him. His <b>super-powered</b> body is still no match for Megatron, and he is severely wounded. Optimus arrives on Earth to join Prowl's unit, aware that Megatron's presence on Earth has caused it to become the main battle front. The Machination also observes the Autobots entering their Lake Michigan base.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought the episode continued the series' season three [...] "hot streak", but wished the promo had not spoiled Senator Van Horn being a shapeshifter. Hanson {{also did not}} fully buy into the Peter-Fauxlivia relationship, as he expected Peter to realize something different about her. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club loved the shapeshifter focus of the episode and graded it an A-, explaining it was a [...] "very strong episode" [...] that [...] "brings back {{one of my favorite}} Fringe concepts: those crazy <b>super-powered</b> shapeshifters". MTV's Josh Wigler also enjoyed the shapeshifter plot, and wrote that [...] "the latest episode of Fringe marks four fantastic installments in a row, instantly establishing season three as having the strongest opening act of any other previous year in the science fiction series. Fringe has reinvented itself by drastically altering just one ingredient in the show's successful format — namely, the true identity of Olivia Dunham — to create something wholly new and amazing". Television Without Pity gave the episode an A-.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the Silver Age Kathy Kane, who was romantically {{attracted}} to Batman, {{the new version}} of Kane is a lesbian. Her sexual orientation was announced {{at the same time}} the character was revealed in the spring of 2006. Stories appeared on television news outlets such as CNN, general news magazines such as USA Today, and gay culture magazines such as Out. The modern Katherine [...] "Kate" [...] Kane made her first comic book appearance in issue #7 of the maxi-series 52 (2006), where Kane is revealed to have been romantically involved with Renee Montoya, a former Gotham City Police detective (who later takes up the mantle of the Question after the original hero dies). When questioned about the editorial decision to make Batwoman a gay character in an interview with Wizard Entertainment, DC Comics Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Dan DiDio stated [...] "It was from conversations we’ve had for expanding the DC Universe, for looking at levels of diversity. We wanted to have a cast that is much more reflective of today’s society and even today’s fanbase. One of the reasons we made her gay is that, again when you have the Batman Family—a series of characters that aren’t <b>super-powered</b> and inhabit the same circle and the same city—you really want to have a point of difference. It was really important to me to make sure every character felt unique." ...|$|E
500|$|Nocturne was {{the first}} release in the Shin Megami Tensei series to be {{released}} overseas. After the release of Nocturne, Atlus' overseas branches decided to add the Shin Megami Tensei moniker to future releases within the Megami Tensei franchise to help market the games. Despite many of the original games not bearing the moniker, it ultimately worked in Atlus' favor as, regardless of title differences, the games chosen for localization were {{all part of the}} larger Megami Tensei franchise, and using the core Shin Megami Tensei moniker kept all the titles under a single banner. Before this decision was made, the series was given the localized title Revelations, used for the first Persona and the first Last Bible. Later, changes to titles were made to make them less unwieldy, such as with Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army. Called Raidō Kuzunoha vs. The <b>Super-Powered</b> Army in Japan, the title was altered as it sounded [...] "goofy" [...] in English. By the time Strange Journey was in development, the franchise had a strong presence overseas, so the team created Strange Journey with localization in mind: the two aspects actively linked with this were the game's setting in Antarctica as opposed to modern-day Japan, {{and the fact that it}} was not given a numeral. Starting with Shin Megami Tensei IV, the company decided to actively promote the franchise overseas to North America, Europe and mainland Asia. After 2016, due to Atlus USA's merger with Sega of America, Sega took over North American publishing duties, although the Atlus brand remained intact.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of {{the fourth}} season, Collider.com's Kayti Burt opined that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is [...] "the X-Men TV show you should be watching". Burt noted that the X-Men film {{franchise}} was expanding to television with the series Legion, but that S.H.I.E.L.D. already served that purpose well, highlighting {{the similarities between the}} X-Men and the Inhumans, both creations of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby during the 1960s consisting of a large group of <b>super-powered</b> people who [...] "are our neighbors and our friends ... both heroes and villains", and face [...] "the same fears and prejudices" [...] from the wider community. Burt felt that the similarities between S.H.I.E.L.D.s Inhumans and the X-Men became [...] "particularly pointed" [...] in the third season with the Hive storyline, which had a lot in common with the film [...] that was released around the same time; Burt was of the opinion that S.H.I.E.L.D. executed the storyline [...] "much better" [...] than the film did. Other similarities Burt discussed were the series diverse and ensemble cast, its take on the mutant cure storyline, the parallels between Daisy Johnson's second season arc and the introduction of Rogue in the first X-Men film, and its social and political commentary. With the latter, Burt also discussed the similarities between the Watchdogs and Donald Trump, calling it [...] "not very subtle, but social commentary doesn't have to be. I appreciate that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is attempting to comment on the current socio-political state of the country in a way that many of the other superhero TV shows don't even attempt to do. It's perhaps the show's most X-Men-like quality." [...] Concluding, Burt said that though the X-Men characters cannot appear in the MCU due to 20th Century Fox holding the rights, [...] "we still get to enjoy many of the themes prominent in the X-Men universe through S.H.I.E.L.D." ...|$|E

2500|$|Howard the Duck is briefly {{seen as part}} of the <b>super-powered</b> army {{gathered}} to battle invading Skrull forces. He is seen armed with a pistol, a Skrull's hand around his neck. He is later seen kicking a Skrull during interrogation after the invasion. Brian Michael Bendis has commented when asked of Howard: [...] "That character has shown up in six issues I've done, and I've never typed the words Howard the Duck".|$|E
2500|$|In Superman #123 (August 1958), Jimmy Olsen uses a magic totem to wish a [...] "Super-Girl" [...] into {{existence}} as a companion and aid to Superman; however, the two frequently get in each other's way until she is fatally injured protecting Superman from a Kryptonite meteor. At her insistence, Jimmy wishes the dying girl out of existence. DC used {{this story to}} gauge public response {{to the concept of}} a completely new <b>super-powered</b> female counterpart to Superman.|$|E
2500|$|Superboy #8 (1950) saw {{the first}} {{adventure}} of [...] "Superbaby," [...] a character which extends the [...] "Junior Superman" [...] concept {{to that of a}} <b>super-powered</b> toddler. The Superbaby stories are set in the time just after the Kents adopt Clark. Superboy #10 (1950) featured the first appearance of Lana Lang, a character that would become a romantic foil for both Superboy and the grown-up Superman. Lana's debut also featured her first attempt to learn Superboy's secret identity.|$|E
2500|$|Supergirl, {{from her}} debut onwards, became a regular backup strip in Action Comics. She joined the Legion of Super-Heroes, like her cousin had {{done as a}} teenager, and in Action Comics #279 (July 1961) she was adopted by Fred and Edna Danvers, {{becoming}} [...] "Linda Lee Danvers". Supergirl acted for three years as Superman's secret weapon, until she was at last introduced by her <b>super-powered</b> cousin to an unsuspecting world in Action Comics #285 (February 1962).|$|E
2500|$|In The Superman Monster (1999), Lex Luthor is Viktor Luther, the creator. He {{discovers the}} {{spacecraft}} {{that would have}} carried the infant Superman to Earth. Inside, however, is only the skeleton of a child. Using the Kryptonian technology, {{he is able to}} animate his (unintentionally) <b>super-powered</b> creature, which initially resembles Bizarro. The creature flees and is raised by the kindly couple Johann and Marta Kant. They name the creature Klaus, after their dead son. The story features the Lois Lane character becoming [...] "The Bride" [...] to Superman's Creature.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the core}} Daredevil series, many {{characters}} {{have had an}} influence in Matt Murdock's life. His father, [...] "Battlin' Jack" [...] Murdock instills in Matt {{the importance of education}} and nonviolence with the aim of seeing his son become a better man than himself. He always encouraged Matt to study, rather than fight like him. Jack forbade his son from undertaking any kind of physical training. It is his father's murder that prompts the <b>super-powered</b> character to become a superhero, fighting gangsters. He was trained by an old blind ninja master named Stick following his childhood accident.|$|E
2500|$|The Silver/Bronze Age Lex Luthor met his non-canonical {{end in the}} [...] "Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?" [...] {{story line}} that closed out Pre-Crisis Superman chronology. Luthor found Brainiac's robotic head and was fused with it. Brainiac took control of Luthor's body and sought to destroy Superman once and for all, teaming up with the Legion of Super-Villains. Fighting Brainiac's control, Luthor begged a <b>super-powered</b> Lana Lang to kill him; she {{complied}} by breaking his neck. Although Luthor died, Brainiac was able to retain control of the body {{for a short period}} of time before rigor mortis set in, and his brain was forced to leave it.|$|E
2500|$|Before Crisis, the Multiverse {{was also}} used to explain an [...] "evil" [...] version of Superman from Earth-Three {{as well as other}} {{versions}} that officially existed. Earth-95 had Jor-El rescue his entire family. Earth-149 saw Lex Luthor succeed in killing Superman.: Earth-Prime was designated as the [...] "real" [...] world, even though Superboy-Prime is from that universe. This version of Clark Kent is from a world without other <b>super-powered</b> beings, where he grows to adolescence reading about DC Superheroes in comic books. During the Crisis on Infinite Earths, he gains powers like those of the Silver Age Superboy and helps to defeat the Anti-Monitor. However, his own world is lost and Superboy-Prime himself is confined to limbo.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the [...] "professional heroes" [...] found in adult urban-fantasy novels, many novels aimed at young adult audiences follow inexperienced protagonists who are unexpectedly drawn into paranormal struggles. Amidst these conflicts, characters often gain allies, find romance, and, in some cases, develop or discover supernatural abilities of their own. In Kelley Armstrong's The Darkest Powers series, a group of teens with paranormal talents go on the run while fleeing from a persistent band of scientists. Gone, by Michael Grant, follows an isolated town in which adults have mysteriously disappeared, leaving a society of <b>super-powered</b> children behind. In Unearthly, by Cynthia Hand, a girl discovers that she is part angel and gifted with superhuman abilities, leading her to seek out her purpose on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{event to}} which Hama refers {{occurred}} in Blackhawk #197 (June 1964). That issue began the [...] "New Blackhawks", {{an attempt to}} modernize the team that included new uniforms. Chop-Chop got a uniform and his own aircraft (he had nearly always ridden with Blackhawk {{or one of the}} other team members prior to this time). Chop-Chop was treated and portrayed as a full member of the team from this point on but certain stereotypical factors were still in play. Like most Asian comic book heroes, he was now a martial arts expert. This was emphasized even more when the Blackhawks tried being <b>super-powered</b> heroes in issues #228 (January 1967) to #241 (Jun-Jul 1968). In that run of stories, Chop-Chop was known as [...] "Dr. Hands." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, a Superboy story called [...] "The Legion of Super-Heroes" [...] in Adventure Comics #247 {{changed all}} that. The story {{features}} three <b>super-powered</b> teenagers from the 30th century who offer Superboy membership in their superhero club, the Legion of Super-Heroes. Although this {{was intended as}} a one-shot tale, the three future teens returned as guest stars in late 1959, and over the next three years, the Legion appeared periodically in Superboy, Supergirl (who also joined the Legion), and even Superman stories. The team membership also exploded from the initial three members to nearly twenty. Finally, the Legion got its own feature, starting in Adventure Comics #300 (1962), with Superboy usually, but not always, appearing as part of the team.|$|E
2500|$|Triphammer – Real name Harley Cohen, an Iron Man-like character, {{he chose}} to {{disappear}} after the events of [...] "Who Killed Retro Girl", in which he kills {{the man who has}} been targeting powers and was {{responsible for the death of}} Retro Girl.

2500|$|The villains Superman {{faced in}} the {{earliest}} stories were ordinary humans, such as gangsters, corrupt politicians, and violent husbands, but they soon grew more outlandish and collectively become Superman's rogues gallery. The mad scientist Ultra-Humanite, [...] introduced in Action Comics #13 (June 1939), was Superman's first recurring villain. The hero's best-known nemesis, Lex Luthor, was introduced in Action Comics #23 (April 1940) and has been envisioned {{over the years as}} both a recluse with advanced weaponry to a power-mad billionaire. In 1944, the magical imp Mister Mxyzptlk, Superman's first recurring <b>super-powered</b> adversary, was introduced. Superman's first alien villain, Brainiac, debuted in Action Comics #242 (July 1958). The monstrous Doomsday, introduced in [...] #17–18 (Nov.-Dec. 1992), was the first villain to evidently kill Superman in physical combat. Other adversaries include the odd Superman-doppelgänger Bizarro, the Kryptonian criminal General Zod, and alien tyrants Darkseid and Mongul.|$|E
