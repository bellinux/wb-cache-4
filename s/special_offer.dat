25|$|Trieste on the Yugoslav border – the year, 1941 — The Rolls is in {{a repair}} shop. The car {{exterior}} is filthy with OCCASIONE (Bargain, <b>Special</b> <b>Offer)</b> {{painted on the}} windscreen. It is bought by Gerda Millett (Ingrid Bergman), a powerful and wealthy American widow touring Europe. Just before the Invasion of Yugoslavia by the Nazi Germans, she encounters anti-fascist Davich (Omar Sharif) who commandeers her automobile to sneak into Yugoslavia, hiding in the boot before the border crossing. Along the way, these two seemingly different people fall in love. At their Ljubljana hotel, they survive a German aerial attack, then she insists on driving him to a partisan camp {{in the mountains and}} makes several trips to pick up more villagers and deliver them to the camp. She wants to stay and help repel the invaders, but Davich will not permit it, saying it is not her fight. He tells her to go back to America and tell people what she has witnessed. The car is seen being unloaded from a cargo ship in New York. During the end credits, it is seen driving along an expressway, passing beneath a road sign reading I-95, George Washington Bridge, Bronx – Next Right.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the UK in December 1972, with a <b>special</b> <b>offer</b> price of £3.10, {{the same as a}} typical single LP from that period. It reached number 16 in the charts. The cover was designed by Glover and featured a colour photo of the band on the front and rear covers, and black and white photos in the inside gatefold. The release in the US was delayed until April 1973, because Warner Bros. wanted to release Who Do We Think We Are first. They were motivated into releasing it due to a steady flow of UK imports being purchased, and it was an immediate commercial success, reaching number 6 in the charts. Warner Brothers also released [...] "Smoke on the Water" [...] as a single, coupling the live recording on Made in Japan with the studio version on Machine Head, and it reached number 4 in the Billboard charts. A recording of [...] "Black Night" [...] from the Tokyo gig, one of the encores that was not on the album, was released as the B-side to the single [...] "Woman from Tokyo" [...] in Europe, and as a single in its own right in Japan.|$|E
500|$|Ocarina of Time was rereleased for the GameCube as a port of the Nintendo 64 ROM {{image in}} {{conjunction}} with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest and {{as a part of}} [...] The former was released as Zeruda no Densetsu: Toki no Okarina GC in Japan, with the Master Quest side named Zeruda no Densetsu: Toki no Okarina GC Ura (ゼルダの伝説 時のオカリナ GC裏). The [...] "Ura" [...] name stems from Master Quests origins, as an expansion to the Ocarina of Time cartridge {{in the form of a}} 64DD disk, under the working title Ura Zelda. The Master Quest compilation was given as a premium for pre-ordering [...] in Japan and North America, as well as in a special GameCube bundle at Walmart wherein the disc came in the same case. In Europe and Australia, the disc came in the same case as the initial pressings of The Wind Waker. In Europe, it was available for a limited time through a <b>special</b> <b>offer</b> on the Nintendo website. The Ocarina of Time Master Quest box contains a single disc that includes the original game; the Master Quest version; six video demos for various GameCube games, including one for The Wind Waker; and a video demo for the Game Boy Advance games [...] Master Quest uses the same engine and plot of Ocarina of Time, but dungeons have been altered. Collector's Edition was available in GameCube bundles in Europe, Australia, and North America, as well as by registering hardware and software, or by subscribing to official magazines or clubs. In addition to Ocarina of Time, the disc also contains the original The Legend of Zelda, , Majora's Mask, a demo of The Wind Waker, and a Zelda retrospective featurette. The original game is displayed on the Nintendo 64 with a resolution of 320×240, but the GameCube ports run at 640×480 and support progressive scan.|$|E

2500|$|Lead singer Joel Madden {{said in an}} {{interview}} with MuchMusic that the album release has been pushed back once more to early March 2007. The first single from the album, [...] "The River", featuring Avenged Sevenfold's lead singer, M. Shadows and guitarist Synyster Gates, appeared online January 4, 2007. In January 2007, a <b>special</b> <b>offer</b> to pre-order the album at the sonymusicstore.com Web site—which guaranteed that the first 500 purchasers would get their name in the album booklet—sold out in the first hour. At midnight, on January 23, 2007 the forthcoming record was made available for preorder on iTunes. Preordering on iTunes also provides the exclusive bonus version of [...] "The River", and a music video of an acoustic session of [...] "Misery". An acoustic version of [...] "March On" [...] could be downloaded through the band's provided that you registered as a member. In addition to the tracks listed below, if bought at Wal-Mart, 5 exclusive songs from their Soundstage performance can be downloaded.|$|E
2500|$|Except for the 30th Anniversary Special, {{which was}} taped at Harrah's Rio in Las Vegas, Nevada, The Price Is Right has been taped in Studio 33 in CBS Television City in Hollywood, California for its entire run. The studio, {{which is also}} used for other {{television}} productions, was renamed the Bob Barker Studio in the host's honor on the ceremonial 5,000th episode taped in March 1998. When Carey became host, {{there was talk of}} the show traveling in the future. The program is usually produced in about an hour, although if there is a guest involved, some tapings will last longer because of question and answer sessions by the audience and the guest, which the host usually moderates. Two episodes are usually taped each day, normally with three taping days per week (Monday through Wednesday, with one episode taped at 12:00pm and another at 4:00pm). The program is taped in advance of its airdate. For example, the show broadcast on February 28, 2008 was taped on January 16. As with many other shows that start production in the summer, the lead time varies during the season, as many as fifteen weeks to as little as one day. The audience is entertained by the announcer before taping begins and in case of guests, the guest will answer questions from the audience. After the taping session, there is a drawing for a door prize. On some episodes, all members of the audience receive a prize from a sponsor or celebrity guest; those prizes are usually mentioned in the Showcase (such as a complimentary slice of Papa John's Pizza, an NHL Winter Classic game puck, a couples' gift box from Hershey's or a book authored by a guest). Television and Internet viewers have also been directed to the show's official website to enter a drawing for a similar prize offered to all viewers or another prize related to the <b>special</b> <b>offer</b> (such as the Rock of Ages signed CD). Some episodes are taped [...] "out-of-order" [...] so that a specific episode will air after other episodes have aired. Notably, the Christmas Week episodes are usually taped in early December outside of the regular rotation. An episode may be taped out-of-order if a prize package reflects a trip to an event that is taking place close to the date that episode will air (primarily with CBS properties such as the Academy of Country Music Awards, NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, and various NFL on CBS games, most notably CBS Super Bowl years since Carey took over, but other games are offered). Other episodes may be aired out-of-order because of game-related incidents or situations beyond the network's control. Most episodes which have aired out of order have occurred when the show is taped far in advance, but in the time between the show taping and its airdate, a natural disaster took place at the trip venue. This happened in June 2005 with episodes that featured trips to New Orleans (which was later struck by Hurricane Katrina), with airdates moved to May and June 2006 and again in April 2010 with episodes that featured trips to Nashville, Tennessee (due to the May 2010 Tennessee floods), with airdates moved to September 2010.|$|E
60|$|Though {{it never}} once {{mentioned}} the grand title it made allusions which {{implied that the}} real rank of the Post Office clerk was well known to every one at Castle Hautboy. And though nothing of course was said as to any possible relations between Lord Persiflage {{as a member of}} the British Cabinet and the clerk's uncle {{as a member of the}} Italian Cabinet, nevertheless as to this also there were allusions which were intelligible. This letter was altogether very gracious,--such a one as few young men would be able to resist coming from such a person as Lady Persiflage. But the <b>special</b> <b>offer</b> which prevailed with our Post Office clerk was no doubt the promise of the presence of Fanny Trafford. In all the rest, gracious as the words were, there was nothing but trouble for him. It was clear enough to him that Lady Persiflage was on the same side as Crocker. Lady Persiflage would no doubt prefer a Duca di Crinola to a Post Office clerk for Lady Frances. And he could see also that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was on the same side. The Secretary of State would not have expressed a special desire to see him, the Post Office clerk, at Castle Hautboy, and have, as it were, welcomed him to the possession of his brother-in-law's daughter, had nothing been told of the Duca di Crinola. He heard as much from Lord Hampstead, who advised him to go to Castle Hautboy, and make himself acquainted with Fanny's family friends. It was all manifest. And as it was all being done in opposition to his own firm resolution, he would not have gone,--but that the temptation was too great for him. Fanny Trafford would be there,--and he was quite open to the charm of the offer which was almost being made to him of Lady Fanny's hand. He arranged the matter at the office, and wrote to Lady Persiflage accepting the invitation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This project examined supermarket pricing behaviour in respect of <b>special</b> <b>offers</b> designed to appeal to consumers {{to encourage them to}} make additional purchases, which in turn might lead to consumers overeating (and thus exacerbating obesity problems in the United Kingdom population) or wasting uneaten food products (and thus exacerbating household food waste problems in the UK). The data produced result from the analysis of summarised data on different types of pricing offers made by four UK supermarket retailers, covering weekly collected price data from their websites for a one year period running from August 2010 to August 2011, in total covering 1, 287, 714 pricing observations. The price data covered <b>special</b> <b>offers</b> and the summary aggregate data was based on the research team's own calculations of <b>special</b> <b>offers</b> offered by the supermarkets across a broad group of products. Further information may be found on the ESRC's The Impact of Retail Pricing on Overeating and Food Waste award webpage. Main Topics : The data comprise a single quantitative file, that includes price data collected on <b>special</b> <b>offers</b> from four UK supermarket retailers' websites...|$|R
