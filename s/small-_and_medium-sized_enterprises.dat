40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit our earlier {{proposed}} domain model based approach to requirements management from a situational method engineering perspective. The approach has originally been developed dedicatedly for a <b>small-</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>enterprise</b> (SME) {{in the field}} of control system development. Broadening the perspective by considering situational method engineering helps to generalize the approach to support any kind of flexible and customer-oriented enterprise that works in highly innovative fields. The investigation has opened up our method for new strategies to make domain model choices and to tailor the requirements-based search for similar projects. Furthermore, the feedback loop that we provide to adapt domain models according to the concrete experiences of an SME within recent projects raises an issue that possibly applies to knowledge management in situational method engineering in general...|$|R
40|$|Building on the {{complementarity}} of the revisited Uppsala {{model and}} effectual logic, {{this article examines}} the role of affective and cognitive trust for developing knowledge in the context of <b>small-</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>enterprise</b> (SME) internationalization in emerging markets. Drawing on qualitative interview data from New Zealand SMEs engaging with Chinese business partners, the article first shows that an overreliance on affective trust can result in a situation of ‘persistent mediation’, in which learning about opportunities is impaired. Second, utilization of the affordable loss principle and a focus on control facilitates relationship-specific knowledge, which may also lead to cognitive trust. However, cognitive trust does not necessarily result in substantive business market knowledge needed to overcome the liability of outsidership. Third, business market knowledge is advanced when partners mutually set goals and develop the opportunity, which potentially also fosters cognitive and affective trust...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} focused on the degree of {{standardisation}} or adaptation and, to a lesser extent, on the determinants of adaptation. This paper advances the literature in four respects. Firstly, we are able to evaluate the relative importance of internal (commitment, experience) versus external (culture, economic) determinants of adaptation. Secondly, we have examined several firm size categories, so we can evaluate how the relative roles of internal and external factors vary by firm size. Thirdly, rather than treat adaptation as one of adjusting {{one or more of the}} four Ps, we use a more holistic concept of adaptation, namely brand adaptation, which subsumes marketing mix adaptation. A scale has been developed to capture this holistic concept. Fourthly, we have developed a new culture scale, one based on the perceptions of <b>Small-</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medium-sized</b> <b>Enterprise</b> (SME) businesses, using domestic operations as a benchmark.

40|$|We {{consider}} a <b>small-</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>enterprise</b> (SME) with a funding gap intending {{to invest in}} a project, of which the cash flow follows a double exponential jump-diffusion process. In contrast to traditional corporate finance theory, we assume the SME is unable to get a loan directly from a bank and hence it enters into a partial guarantee agreement with an insurer and a lender. Utilizing a real options approach, we develop an investment and financing model with a partial guarantee. We explicitly derive the pricing and timing of the option to invest. We find that if the funding gap rises, the option value decreases but its investment threshold first declines and then increases. The larger the guarantee level, the lower the option value and the later the investment. The optimal coupon rate decreases with project risk and a growth of the guarantee level can effectively reduce agency conflicts...|$|R

5000|$|Globalization has {{led some}} firms to market {{beyond the borders of}} their home countries, making {{international}} marketing a part of those firms' marketing strategy. Marketing managers are often responsible for influencing the level, timing, and composition of customer demand. In part, this is because the role of a marketing manager (or sometimes called managing marketer in <b>small-</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises)</b> can vary significantly based on a business's size, corporate culture, and industry context. For example, in a <b>small-</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>enterprises,</b> the managing marketer may contribute in both managerial and marketing operations roles for the company brands. In a large consumer products company, the marketing manager may act as the overall general manager of his or her assigned product.To create an effective, cost-efficient marketing management strategy, firms must possess a detailed, objective understanding of their own business and the market in which they operate.
