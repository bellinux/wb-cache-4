The latter describes a will in which she distributes appropriate gifts to her famous clients: [...] "a picture of Sodom and Gomorrah to indorsing D―n; an ounce of Mercuris Dulcis to Beau C―e, of St. Martin's Lane; her estate to the Duke of Wharton; her library to Ned C―; and a receipt to cure a clap to little Quibus".

Karolina Ramos from The GW Hatchet compared Ferreira to New Zealand recording artist Lorde, {{both of whom}} she felt [...] "tackle contemporary love, desire and insecurity with depth, composure and frankness." [...] She compared her musical style to 1980s pop music, and noted that [...] "her throaty, sultry vocals call to mind Lana del Rey, abandoning brightness and vivacity for a colder tone. Still, Ferreira can drop the edge, with gentler tracks like [...] "Sad Dream" [...] showcasing her vocal range and seldom-observed softness." [...] Andrew Unterberger stated that [...] "through a variety of singles, EPs, guest features and live appearances, Sky has proven herself {{one of the most}} talented singers, creative songwriters and savvy collaborators currently working in the genre", but blamed [...] "bad marketing, label disputes and her own perfectionism" [...] for the extended delay of Night Time, My Time; he also stated that the repeated renaming of the record itself [...] "should give you <b>some</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musical identity issues she's suffered over the years." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyond this trivial complaint, the Army and the Einsatzgruppen {{worked closely}} and effectively. On 6 July 1941 Einsatzkommando 4b of Einsatzgruppe C {{reported}} that [...] "Armed forces surprisingly welcome hostility against the Jews". Few {{complaints about the}} killings were ever raised by Wehrmacht officers. On 8 September, Einsatzgruppe D reported that relations with the German Army were [...] "excellent". In the same month, Stahlecker of Einsatzgruppe A wrote that Army Group North had been exemplary in co-operating with the exterminations and that relations with the 4th Panzer Army, commanded by General Erich Hoepner, were [...] "very close, almost cordial". In the south, the Romanian Army worked closely with Einsatzgruppe D to massacre Ukrainian Jews, killing around 26,000 Jews in the Odessa massacre. The German historian Peter Longerich thinks it probable that the Wehrmacht, along with the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), incited the Lviv pogroms, during which 8,500 to 9,000 Jews {{were killed by the}} native population and Einsatzgruppe C in July 1941. Moreover, most people on the home front in Germany had <b>some</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> massacres being committed by the Einsatzgruppen. British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper noted that although Himmler had forbidden photographs of the killings, it was common for both the men of the Einsatzgruppen and for bystanders to take pictures to send to their loved ones, which he felt suggested widespread approval of the massacres.|$|E
500|$|Sadleir notes how Walpole's {{considerable}} income {{enabled him}} to indulge not only his love of art and of old books and manuscripts, but also philanthropy, particularly towards younger writers. Although Walpole enjoyed the limelight, he was secretive about his many acts of generosity to younger writers, with both encouragement and financial help. After his death <b>some</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scale of his generosity was discovered. Osbert Sitwell commented, [...] "I don't {{think there was any}} younger writer of any worth who has not {{at one time or another}} received kindness of an active kind, and at a crucial moment, from Hugh". Hart-Davis lists thirty-eight authors from whom letters of gratitude were found among Walpole's correspondence; Sadleir writes of Walpole's [...] "generous kindness to literary aspirants and to writers fallen on evil days... by immediate financial assistance, by prefaces freely supplied or by collaboration volunteered, by introductions and recommendations to likely publishers, Walpole relieved the distresses of authorship to a degree which will never be fully known." [...] Agate, though himself the recipient of Walpole's generosity on occasion, thought it sometimes went too far: [...] "Mr Walpole's large-heartedness gets him into all kinds of trouble. He is an inveterate patter. He pats on the back young men whom sterner critics would knock down, because even in fantastic incompetence he perceives the good intention. No art or artist is safe from Mr Walpole's benevolence".|$|E

[...] The Sunday Times observed, [...] "Just when you thought you might go a week without seeing a mention of brand Beckham, here is a documentary on their best friends, brand Tom Cruise, as recorded by the least reverential writers and least convincing lookalikes on the planet. Scientologists might prefer something on the Sci-fi channel." [...] Victoria Segal, Sally Kinnes and Sarah Dempster of The Sunday Times highlighted the episode in their [...] "Critics' Choice" [...] column. They commented that the show's producers [...] " [...] their own account of his career, his love life and his religion: It's all about aliens. Comedy so broad it barely fits on the screen, it is hard not to be amused". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun highlighted the program as his [...] "Top Choice". Adams commented, [...] "This ruthless but spot-on parody re-enacts Cruise's life and career through Hollywood gossip, rumour and exaggeration (his father is a midget, Katie Holmes a robot, Nicole Kidman a beer-swilling bogan), but is an antidote to every interview he's ever done." [...] Writing for The Newcastle Herald, Anita Beaumont commented, [...] "This is really silly stuff, but it is amusing enough to enliven a fairly dull night of TV." [...] The Sunday Mirror wrote that the program [...] "was as subtle as a sledge hammer". Simon Hoggart of The Spectator called the program [...] "a magnificently over-the-top anti-celebrity festival".|$|E
