Therefore, in order to save lives and reduce injuries, well-designed evacuation process is significant. Thus, this research investigates the loopholes of the evacuation process in the Sri Lankan healthcare sector which, would be helped to improve the evacuation process in hospital buildings in Sri Lanka near future. The research study was initiated with a comprehensive literature review and subsequently adopted a qualitative research approach to investigate the research phenomena. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with fire safety professionals to investigate the requirements and parameters of the evacuation process and the loopholes of fire evacuation process in Sri Lankan healthcare sector. The collected data was analysed through content analysis by manual. The research findings revealed that the fire <b>safety</b> <b>door,</b> evacuation assembly point, compartmentation, fire detection and alarm system and closings of high risk rooms’ doors are engaged with some loopholes which need to be improved. Loopholes contributing to evacuation process are; inadequate space in assembly points, lack of inspection by fire wardens etc. The research therefore suggests that regular maintenance, involvement of space planner from the initial construction stage, conducting training programs to staffs including managerial level, would help to improve the existing evacuation process in the Sri Lankan healthcare sector...|$|E

25|$|The Royal Navy Battle Cruiser Fleet {{had also}} {{emphasised}} speed in ammunition handling over established safety protocol. In practice drills, cordite {{could not be}} supplied to the guns rapidly enough through the hoists and hatches. To bring up the propellant in good time to load for the next broadside, many <b>safety</b> <b>doors</b> were kept open {{that should have been}} shut to safeguard against flash fires. Bags of cordite were also stocked and kept locally, creating a total breakdown of safety design features. By staging charges in the chambers between the gun turret and magazine, the Royal Navy enhanced their rate of fire but left their ships vulnerable to chain reaction ammunition fires and magazine explosions. This 'bad safety habit' carried over into real battle practices. Furthermore, the doctrine of a high rate of fire also led to the decision in 1913 to increase the supply of shells and cordite held on the British ships by 50%, for fear of running out of ammunition. When this exceeded the capacity of the ships' magazines, cordite was stored in insecure places.|$|R

50|$|The crew {{placed the}} ship on {{autopilot}} {{and did not}} have a crew member watch the ship. Even with autopilot on, standard practice calls for one crew member to watch the controls, for example to avoid collisions with other vessels. The crew deployed the fin stabilizers system to decrease the motions in bad weather; normally both stabilizer fins deployed, but in this case the port stabilizer fin did not deploy. This caused the ship to drift and therefore not travel in a straight line. A crew member discovered the problem and, at the last minute, tried to steer the ship to port. This action occurred too late. At 10:12 P.M. the ship struck the east face of the taller Portes pinnacle. The rocks tore a six-meter long and one-meter wide hole above the water line. After that impact, the rocks bent the stabilizer fin backwards, and the fin cut through the hull through the side, below the waterline, and next to the engine room. The water from the three-meter gash destroyed the main generators and ended electrical power. Professor David Molyneaux, a ship safety expert, said that the damage sustained by the MS Express Samina should not normally sink such a ship. The ship sank because nine of the ship's eleven watertight compartment doors were open when safety laws require ship operators to close and lock the <b>safety</b> <b>doors.</b> The water spread beyond the engine room, and {{due to a lack of}} power the operators could not remotely shut the doors. Molyneaux described the open watertight doors as the most significant aspect of the sinking.|$|R
