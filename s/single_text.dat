5|$|The panel {{facing the}} Mount Kailash panel towards the {{northeast}} corner (see 1 on plan) depicts demon king Ravana trying to lift Kailash and bother Shiva, a legend called Ravananugraha. The upper scene is Mount Kailash, where Shiva and Parvati are seated. Shiva is recognizable with a crown, and other characters are badly damaged. A portion of ascetic skeletal devotee Bhringi relief survives and he is seated near Shiva's feet. Near Shiva an outline of {{what may have been}} Ganesha and Kartikeya are visible. Below the mountain surface is shown the demon-king Ravana is seen with a few arms, trying to unsuccessfully shake Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash. The rest of the details are blurry and speculative. According to Charles Collins, the discernible elements of this panel are generally consistent with those in medieval era Puranas, though there is a lack in literal correspondence with any <b>single</b> <b>text.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} literary {{references to}} Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. There {{have been few}} attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian tradition as a whole, {{rather than in a}} <b>single</b> <b>text</b> or text/story-type. A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material. The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum, but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters, destructive divine boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and witches. The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or onomastic folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape. The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn. On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin.|$|E

These texts primarily focus either on how to achieve a heavenly ascent through the Heichalot (heavenly palaces) and what to expect there, or on drawing down angelic spirits to interact and help the adept. There are several larger documents of the heichalot, such as Hekhalot Rabbati, in which six of the seven palaces of God are described, Hekhalot Zutarti, Shiur Komah and 6th-century 3 Enoch, as well as hundreds of small documents, many little more than fragments.|$|E

Percy probably corrected and copyedited the journal section while Mary did the same for his letters. Advertisements for the work appeared on 30 October in the Morning Chronicle and on 1 November in The Times, promising a 6 November release.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the work of Josef Škvorecký as a whole. In doing this, we aim to define {{specific}} plot sequences, narrative techniques, recurrent motifs etc. Simultaneously, the relations between <b>single</b> <b>texts</b> become clearer. The author offers a possible fictional world in each of his literary pieces. However, their perspectives often coalesce while the author deliberately alludes to events and occurrences known from his previous books, giving the reader a chance to link the items of the fictional worlds together. Using identical or very similar singularities, the author creates an "intertextual literary world", a self-contained macrocosm of sorts that should be as homogenous as possible. His plots have constant settings; his books include the same characters, his topic sequences are similar etc. ¨ Obviously, Škvorecký attempts to create a homogenous macrocosm consisting of his texts. Bearing that in mind, we nevertheless regard every Škvoreckýs work as a self-contained fictional world. This approach is shown in the thesis e. g. on the motif of Kostelec as the hometown of different characters named Danny Smiřický. Each Danny is a specific singularity; we can follow their different perspectives in the fictional worlds of <b>single</b> <b>texts.</b> Certain lines of the characters development are closer, such as [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|Prodigious {{energy was}} {{expended}} by ancient Indian culture {{in ensuring that}} these texts were transmitted {{from generation to generation}} with inordinate fidelity.

2500|$|During his ten-year reign, Paisie revived Wallachian printing, {{which still}} used Church Slavonic rather than {{preserving}} the attested vernacular. This reflected his patronage of Serb craftsmen from the Republic of Venice and the Sanjak of Bosnia, including Božidar Vuković and of Vuković's nephew, Dimitrije Ljubavić. Bibliologist Agnes Terezia Erich proposes that, by relocating Ljubavić's press to Târgoviște in 1544, Paisie inaugurated [...] "artisan printing in Wallachia"; however, the enterprise itself was entirely private, the first non-public {{press in the}} history of Romania. As Iorga notes, his Early Cyrillic, introduced by Ljubavić for various prayer books, was inferior to the type used in previous decades; the illustrations, instead, were [...] "rather beautiful". The impact of Slavonic as a state language remained high, even though occasionally challenged by Greek. According to archivist Aurelian Sacerdoțeanu, the penetration of Greek at Paisie's court was overestimated because of a <b>single</b> <b>text</b> which survived in Greek translation. The rediscovery of its Slavonic original toned down that claim, although [...] "one could still write in Greek in Wallachia at that time." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{potential}} problem of structuralist interpretation {{is that it}} can be highly reductive, as scholar Catherine Belsey puts it: [...] "the structuralist danger of collapsing all difference." [...] An example of such a reading might be if a student concludes the authors of West Side Story did not write anything [...] "really" [...] new, because their work has the same structure as Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. In both texts a girl and a boy fall in love (a [...] "formula" [...] with a symbolic operator between them would be [...] "Boy + Girl") {{despite the fact that they}} belong to two groups that hate each other ("Boy's Group - Girl's Group" [...] or [...] "Opposing forces") and conflict is resolved by their death. Structuralist readings focus on how the structures of the <b>single</b> <b>text</b> resolve inherent narrative tensions. If a structuralist reading focuses on multiple texts, there must be some way in which those texts unify themselves into a coherent system. The versatility of structuralism is such that a literary critic could make the same claim about a story of two friendly families ("Boy's Family + Girl's Family") that arrange a marriage between their children despite the fact that the children hate each other ("Boy - Girl") and then the children commit suicide to escape the arranged marriage; the justification is that the second story's structure is an 'inversion' of the first story's structure: the relationship between the values of love and the two pairs of parties involved have been reversed.|$|E
