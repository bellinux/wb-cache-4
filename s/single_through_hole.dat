40|$|Recovering the {{position}} of a source from the fluxes of diffusing particles through small receptors allows a biological cell to determine its relative position, spatial localization and guide it to a final target.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} if copper nanoparticles could be utilized for two types of <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> plating in printed circuit boards, namely: as a catalytic material to initiate the electroless copper deposition process; and as a “conductive” layer which is coherent and conductive enough to allow “direct” electroplating of the <b>through</b> <b>hole.</b> The employment of nanoparticles means that an effective method of dispersion is required and this paper studies the use of mechanical agitation and ultrasound for this purpose. Design/methodology/approach – The paper utilized drilled, copper clad FR 4 laminate. The <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> were functionalized using a commercially available “conditioner” before being immersed in a solution of copper nanoparticles which were dispersed using either a magnetic stirrer or ultrasound (40 kHz). When the copper nanoparticles were utilized as a catalytic material for electroless copper plating, the efficacy of the technique was assessed using a standard “backlight” test which allowed the plating coverage of the <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> to be determined. As a control, a standard palladium catalysed electroless copper process was employed. The morphology of the electroless copper deposits was also analysed using scanning electron microscopy. In the “direct plate” approach, after immersion in the copper nanoparticle dispersion, the <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> were electroplated at 3 [*]Adm− 2 for 15 [*]min, sectioned and examined using an optical microscope. The distance that the copper electroplate had penetrated down the <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> was then determined. Findings – The paper has shown that copper nanoparticles can be used as a catalytic material for electroless copper plating. The coverage of the electroless copper in the <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> improves as the copper nanoparticle concentration increases and, at the highest copper nanoparticle concentrations employed, good, but not complete, electroless copper coverage is obtained. Dispersion of the copper nanoparticles using ultrasound is critical to the process. Ultrasonically dispersed copper nanoparticles achieve some limited success as a conductive layer for “direct” electroplating with some penetration of the electroplated deposit into the <b>through</b> <b>hole.</b> However, if mechanical agitation is employed to mix the nanoparticles, no <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> plating obtaines. Originality/value – The paper has demonstrated the “proof of concept” that copper nanoparticles can be utilized to catalyse the electroless copper process, as well as their potential to replace costly palladium‐based activators. The paper also illustrates the potential for copper nanoparticles to be used as a “direct plate process” and the necessity for using ultrasound for their dispersion in either process...|$|R

40|$|In this report, Silicon wafer based multi-layered {{print circuit}} board is presented. The {{developed}} stacked circuit board {{will lead to}} realization of 3 dimensional MEMS packaging. The <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> and trenches were formed by ICP Si deep etching and the stacked layered structure was prepared with Si fusion bonding of ICP etched wafers. Metal was filled into ICP fabricated <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> and trenches to make electrical feed through. Four Silicon wafers with ICP <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> are aligned and successfully joined by fusion bonding. The target application of this work is multi-layered Silicon based print circuit board. The electrical feed through was fabricated by injecting the Ag (80 wt%) + Cu(20 wt %) mixed with binder, low melting temperature metal, and Ag electrical conductive paste into the small diameter <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> and trenches in oxidized Silicon wafer stacked structure. A multi-component binder system comprising of EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate 35 wt%) + PW (Paraffin Wax 65 wt%) was used. Super critical debinding method is applied prior to final sintering process. The ratio of metal powder and binder was optimized. Low melting point metal and electrical conductive paste filling methods were also tried by injection and vacuum extraction. SEM observation shows that the <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> are filled with metal for a single wafer. However we have still difficulty in filling the metal into four wafers stacked layer.
