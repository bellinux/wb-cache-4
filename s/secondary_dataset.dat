ObjectiveThe purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether there was {{an increased risk of}} new onset diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia among patients with asthma or COPD treated with inhaled corticosteroids. MethodsA retrospective analysis evaluated all double-blind, placebo-controlled, trials in patients ≥ 4 years of age involving budesonide or budesonide/formoterol in asthma (26 trials; budesonide: n =  9067; placebo: n =  5926), and in COPD (8 trials; budesonide: n =  4616; non-ICS: n =  3643). A <b>secondary</b> <b>dataset</b> evaluated all double-blind, controlled trials in asthma involving the use of inhaled corticosteroids (60 trials; budesonide: n =  33, 496; fluticasone: n =  2773). ResultsIn the primary asthma dataset, the occurrence of diabetes mellitus/hyperglycaemia adverse events (AEs) was 0. 13 % for budesonide and 0. 13 % for placebo (HR 0. 98 [95 % CI: 0. 38 – 2. 50], p =  0. 96) and serious adverse events (SAEs) was 0 % for budesonide and 0. 05 % for placebo. In the <b>secondary</b> <b>dataset,</b> the occurrence of diabetes/hyperglycaemia as AE and SAE was 0. 19 % and 0. 03 %, respectively.

Methods: Relevant datasets were identified using online searches; they were excluded if they had low sample sizes, were assembled prior to 1990 or on only one occasion, were not potentially accessible, or were limited to a specific population. Remaining datasets were assessed according to content, sampling frame and size, timing and ability {{to be used to}} assess inequalities and regional trends. Results: A total of 96 datasets were identified, but only 11 had the potential to be used to assess trends. Eight of these contained data on physical activity, 8 on diet and 3 on obesity. The period over which trends might be assessed varied from 2 years to over 10, with over half of the datasets expected to continue data collection into the future. Most had the potential to be used to assess inequalities and also regional and sub-regional level trends, albeit with relatively small sample sizes. There were some limitations to the datasets, such as non-objective measures of diet and physical activity and, in some, low response rates, which would require further consideration when utilizing individual datasets. Conclusions: Awareness of {{the potential of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>datasets</b> for monitoring trends in childhood obesity should be raised, alongside the financial and intellectual capacity to enhance and exploit them...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} inductive transfer {{learning for}} dataset shift, {{a situation in}} which the distributions of two sampled, but closely related, datasets differ. When the target data to be predicted is scarce, one would like to improve its prediction by employing data from the other, <b>secondary,</b> <b>dataset.</b> Transfer learning tries to address this task by suitably compensating such a dataset shift. In this work we assume that the distributions of the covariates and the dependent variables can differ arbitrarily between the datasets. We propose two methods for regression based on importance weighting. Here to each instance of the secondary data a weight is assigned such that the data contributes positively to the prediction of the target data.
