50|$|The Indonesian government, {{operating}} {{mainly through}} the <b>State</b> <b>Electricity</b> <b>Corporation</b> (Perusahaan Listrik Negara, or PLN), encouraged independent power producers (IPPs) {{to invest in}} the electric power sector. Numerous IPPs are investing in large plants (over 500 MW) and many smaller plants (such as 200 MW and smaller). To support this investment, power purchase agreement (PPA) arrangements are agreed with the PLN. Prices vary widely from relatively low prices for large coal-based plants such as the Cirebon coal plant which began operations in late 2012 to higher prices for smaller geothermal plants producing more expensive power from distant locations such as the Wayang Windu geothermal plant in West Java. Indonesia has made a range of different FIT Regulations for different forms of renewable electricity generation, for example geothermal energy and solar photovoltaic electricity generation. These regulations mandate the price that should be paid by PLN to the IPP in various different circumstances, provided that preconditions are met.|$|E
