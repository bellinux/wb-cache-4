5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders.

This strategy was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself {{with varying degrees of}} success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as frivolous and De la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner tried to be seen as serious and determined.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – An {{understanding}} of how to alter crowd dynamics would have a significant impact in a number of scenarios, e. g., during riots or evacuations. The <b>social</b> <b>force</b> model, where individuals are self-driven particles interacting through <b>social</b> and physical <b>forces,</b> is one approach that has been used to describe crowd dynamics. This work uses the framework of the <b>social</b> <b>force</b> model to study the effects of introducing autonomous robots into crowds. Two simple pedestrian flow problems are used as illustrative examples, namely flow in varying width hallways and lane formation in bidirectional pedestrian flow. Preliminary results indicate that robots capable of inducing an attractive <b>social</b> <b>force</b> are effective at improving pedestrian flow in both of these scenarios...|$|R

5|$|Although Golos Truda sharply {{criticized the}} anarchist communists of Petrograd as romantics, {{ignorant of the}} complex <b>social</b> <b>forces</b> of the Revolution among Petrograd's Bolshevik-supporting factory workers, {{the ideas of the}} union and its paper were {{considered}} bizarre and met with little initial success.

The paper's circulation continuing to increase in the city and its provinces, with robust anarcho-syndicalist collectives and meetings emerging in Kronstadt, Oboukhovo, and Kolpino. In March 1918, the Bolsheviks moved the seat of government from Petrograd to Moscow, and the anarchists swiftly followed, moving the printing of Golos Truda to the new capital.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, Émile Durkheim {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} to suggest that gods represent an extension of human social life to include supernatural beings.

However, it is much harder to enforce morality using <b>social</b> <b>forces</b> in much larger groups.

25|$|Because pronominal {{reference}} systems to the speaker, addressee, {{and a third}} person are so common (some argue universal) cross-linguistically, {{it would seem that}} pronoun systems are quite stable. However, the changes involved in second-person pronouns in English call this stability into question and highlight the significance of <b>social</b> <b>forces</b> in language development. The spread of feudalistic ideology caused many European languages to develop two sets of second-person singular pronouns in order to reflect hierarchy. Therefore, pronouns encoded not only person or number, but also the speaker's assessment of the addressee's status and the speaker-addressee relationship.|$|E

I state boldly first as a given that sport has obviously become an extremely powerful <b>social</b> <b>force</b> in society. If we grant that it now has such power in our culture–a power indeed that appears to be growing steadily–we can also recognize that any such <b>social</b> <b>force</b> affecting society can be dangerous if perverted (e. g., positive nationalism to blind chauvinism,; normal commercialism to excessive commercialism; wholesome sport competition to “own-the-podium mentality).

40|$|AbstractOver {{the last}} years {{multiple}} variations of the <b>Social</b> <b>Force</b> model have been proposed. While most of the available force-based models are calibrated on observed human movement data, validation for investigating the model characteristics, e. g. variance in parameter values, is still sparse. We present a novel methodology for validating <b>Social</b> <b>Force</b> based models which investigates the reproducibility of human movement behavior on the individual trajectory level with real-world movement data. Our approach estimates model parameter values and their distribution with non-linear regression on observed trajectory data, where the resulting variances of the parameter values represent the model's validity. We demonstrate our approach on a comprehensive (235 pedestrians) and highly accurate (within a few centimeters) set of human movement trajectories obtained from real-world pedestrian traffic with bidirectional flow using an automatic people tracking approach based on Kinect sensors. We validate the <b>Social</b> <b>Force</b> model of Helbing and Molnár (1995), Helbing and Johansson (2009) and Rudloff et al. (2011) ...|$|R

40|$|We look at <b>social</b> <b>force</b> {{models as}} a way to model the {{behaviour}} of human crowds, in order to eval- uate how well these types of models simulate crowd behaviour, and what the models’ strengths and weaknesses are. In order to do this evaluation, we implement a computer simulation of an exemplary <b>social</b> <b>force</b> model. In order to create this simulation, we pick an exemplary model that is well described in the article that presents it, and analyse it in detail, filling in details from other articles when necessary. Based on this analysis of the model, we go from the abstract model formulation to a concrete numerical simulation by filling in required details, such as how to approximate the movement of pedestrians, how to set initial conditions and values, and how to implement the interaction between pedestrians and walls in practice. From our results, it is clear that our simulation (with the right parameters) exhibits reasonable pedestrian behaviour upon visual inspection. While we successfully replicate some results from the literature, other effects do not manifest themselves. We discuss several reasons for this dis- crepancy, including features that are missing from the model, parameter values, effects of using random numbers to generate the initial conditions and possible errors in our implementation of the model. Based on the results of our own simulations and our review of the <b>social</b> <b>force</b> modelling field, we assess <b>social</b> <b>force</b> models and their strengths and weaknesses. We conclude that <b>social</b> <b>force</b> models are not based on any theories for the behaviour of crowds, but are created to replicate a set of observations. As such, any confidence in their predictions must come from a record of pro- ducing results fitting observations; and since the field is relatively new, they have not yet reached this state. <b>Social</b> <b>force</b> models do, however, provide a practical way to simulate something that would otherwise be impossible to simulate. As such, they are the best available way to provide e. g. guidance when designing facilities that must accommodate many pedestrians, and given time the accuracy of their predictions will probably increase...|$|R
30|$|The {{most widely}} adopted {{particle}} based approach {{is represented by}} the <b>social</b> <b>force</b> model (Helbing and Molnár 1995), which implicitly employs fundamental proxemic (Hall 1966) concepts like the tendency of a pedestrian to stay away from other ones while moving towards his/her goal. Proxemics essentially represents a fundamental assumption of most modelling approaches, although very few authors actually mention this anthropological theory (notably CA based models (Ezaki et al. 2012; Was 2010) and an agent-based model (Manenti et al. 2010)).

40|$|Passenger {{behavior}} and ship environment {{are the key}} factors affecting evacuation efficiency. However, current studies ignore the interior layout of passenger ship cabins and treat the cabins as empty rooms. To investigate the influence of obstacles (e. g., tables and stools) on cabin evacuation, we propose an agent-based <b>social</b> <b>force</b> model for advanced evacuation analysis of passenger ships; this model uses a goal-driven submodel to determine a plan and an extended <b>social</b> <b>force</b> submodel to govern the movement of passengers. The extended <b>social</b> <b>force</b> submodel considers the interaction forces between the passengers, crew, and obstacles and minimises the range of these forces to improve computational efficiency. We drew the following conclusions based {{on a series of}} evacuation simulations conducted in this study: (1) the proposed model endows the passenger with the behaviors of bypassing and crossing obstacles, (2) funnel-shaped exits from cabins can improve evacuation efficiency, and (3) as the exit angle increases, the evacuation time also increases. These findings offer ship designers some insight towards increasing the safety of large passenger ships...|$|R
