5|$|Again {{unable to}} get his {{expanded}} gambling proposal past the Senate, Beshear attempted to chip away at the Republican majority in that chamber by appointing <b>some</b> <b>Republican</b> senators to lucrative positions in the executive and judicial branches {{in advance of the}} 2010 General Assembly. Shortly after the special session, Beshear named Republican senator Charlie Borders to the state Public Safety Commission. That appointment set up a special election for Borders' seat, which was won by Democratic senator Robin Webb, reducing the Republican majority to 20–17 with one Independent who usually voted with the Republicans. Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, but Republicans held on to that seat in a special election.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Willis and then-wife Demi Moore {{campaigned for}} Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis's Presidential bid. Four years later, he {{supported}} President George H. W. Bush for reelection {{and was an}} outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. However, in 1996, he declined to endorse Clinton's Republican opponent Bob Dole, because Dole had criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film Striptease. Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention, and supported George W. Bush that year. He did not make any contributions or public endorsements in the 2008 presidential campaign. In several June 2007 interviews, he declared that he maintains <b>some</b> <b>Republican</b> ideologies.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of {{consensus}} delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away <b>some</b> <b>Republican</b> votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.|$|E
50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{opposed the}} deal {{because they wanted}} the budget to focus on {{reducing}} government spending, not increasing government revenue through increased fees. <b>Some</b> <b>Republicans</b> opposed the increased airline ticket fees as a tax increase.|$|R

5|$|Willis {{faced the}} {{challenge}} of having Democratic majorities {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly and strong Democratic leadership in each. In the House, Democrats held a 56–44 majority, and Harry Lee Waterfield served as Speaker of the House. In the Senate, Democrats held a 23–15 majority, and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate was Earle C. Clements. Both Waterfield and Clements were preparing to make gubernatorial runs in 1947. Willis did not make wholesale dismissals of Democrats in the state government, owing in part to shortages of experienced people during the war. This cost him <b>some</b> <b>Republican</b> support, and both his lieutenant governor and attorney general began to oppose him on many matters. However, his refusal to make wholesale dismissals may have been responsible the legislature not stripping the bulk of his gubernatorial powers as it had done to Flem D. Sampson, the last Republican governor.|$|E
5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by <b>some</b> <b>Republican</b> aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E
25|$|The United States Housing Act of 1937 {{created the}} United States Housing Authority within the U.S. Department of the Interior. It {{was one of}} the last New Deal {{agencies}} created. The bill passed in 1937 with <b>some</b> <b>Republican</b> support to abolish slums.|$|E

25|$|As Bush lagged in {{the polls}} in the weeks {{preceding}} the August 1992 Republican National Convention, <b>some</b> <b>Republican</b> strategists (led by Secretary of State James Baker) viewed Quayle as a liability to the ticket and pushed for his replacement. Quayle ultimately survived the challenge and secured renomination.|$|E

His appointment drew {{opposition from the}} Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Council on American–Islamic Relations, the Southern Poverty Law Center, Democrat Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, and <b>some</b> <b>Republican</b> strategists, because of statements in Breitbart News that were alleged to be racist or antisemitic.|$|E
25|$|Northern Ireland {{comprises}} {{a patchwork}} of communities whose national loyalties are represented in some areas by flags flown from flagpoles or lamp posts. The Union Jack and the former Northern Ireland flag are flown in many loyalist areas, and the Tricolour, adopted by republicans as the flag of Ireland in 1916,}} is flown in <b>some</b> <b>republican</b> areas. Even kerbstones in some areas are painted red-white-blue or green-white-orange, depending on whether local people express unionist/loyalist or nationalist/republican sympathies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>Republican</b> leaders {{considered}} Dewey to be {{too young}} (he was only 38, just three years above the minimum age required by the US Constitution) and too inexperienced to lead the nation in wartime. Furthermore, Dewey's non-interventionist stance became problematic when Germany quickly conquered France, and seemed poised to invade Britain. As a result, many Republicans switched to Wendell Willkie, who was a decade older and supported aid to the Allies fighting Germany. Willkie lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the general election.|$|E

25|$|Senator John McCain {{has also}} {{previously}} proposed laws regulating carbon emissions, {{such as the}} McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act, although his position on climate change is unusual among high-ranking party members. <b>Some</b> <b>Republican</b> candidates have supported development of alternative fuels {{in order to achieve}} energy independence for the US. The Republican party rejects cap-and-trade policy to limit carbon emissions. Some Republicans support increased oil drilling in protected areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a position that has drawn criticism from activists.|$|E
25|$|As the schism in the Democratic party deepened, {{moderate}} Republicans {{argued that}} {{an alliance with}} anti-administration Democrats, especially Stephen Douglas, would be a key advantage in the 1860 elections. <b>Some</b> <b>Republican</b> observers saw {{the controversy over the}} Lecompton Constitution as an opportunity to peel off Democratic support in the border states, where Frémont picked up little support. After all, the border states had often gone for Whigs with a Northern base of support in the past without prompting threats of Southern withdrawal from the Union.|$|E
25|$|Cleland {{was viewed}} as a {{moderate}} in the Senate. Though he supported <b>some</b> <b>Republican</b> budgetary measures, and voted in favor of George W. Bush's 2001 tax-cut package, he was staunchly pro-choice and pro-environment. He voted against drilling in ANWR, and opposed Gale Norton's nomination as Secretary of the Interior in 2001. His record on national defense and homeland security was more centrist. He voted to federalize airport security after 9/11, and supported the war on terror. Cleland was strongly pro-free trade, voting to normalize trade relations with Vietnam, to make China's NTR status permanent, and to extend free trade to Andean nations.|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s, {{virtually}} all Southern senators blocked the proposed Wagner-Costigan bill. Southern senators used a filibuster {{to prevent a}} vote on the bill. <b>Some</b> <b>Republican</b> senators, such as the conservative William Borah from Idaho, opposed the bill for constitutional reasons {he had also opposed the Dyer Bill}. He felt it encroached on state sovereignty and, by the 1930s, thought that social conditions had changed so that the bill was less needed. He spoke at length in opposition to the bill in 1935 and 1938. 1934 saw 15 lynchings of African Americans with 21 lynchings in 1935, 8 in 1936, and 2 in 1939.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>republican</b> Infantería de Marina units {{also saw}} {{frontline}} combat action; the 151 Brigada Mixta, was a mixed brigade composed of Spanish Republican Navy Marines led by Commander Pedro Muñoz Caro. Its landing operations activity was limited, however, {{by the lack}} of offensive actions and the general ineffectiveness of the Spanish Republican Navy. Therefore, these Republican Marines saw action mostly inland supporting the Army in such battles as the Battle of Alfambra, Battle of Brunete, Battle of the Ebro and the Battle of the Segre, far away from the sea. Photographer Robert Capa took pictures of the Spanish Republican Navy Marines in one of these inland battles.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, a Republican biracial {{coalition}} gained {{election of}} Lloyd Lowndes, Jr. as governor, and also achieved election of <b>some</b> <b>Republican</b> congressmen, including Sydney Emanuel Mudd, after Democratic dominance. Over {{the next several}} decades, the African-American population struggled in a discriminatory environment. The Democratic-dominated legislature tried to pass disfranchising bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911, but it was rebuffed on each occasion, {{in large part because}} of black opposition and strength. Blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and had established themselves in several cities, where they had comparative security. In addition, immigrants comprised 15% of the voting population and opposed these measures. The legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants.|$|E
