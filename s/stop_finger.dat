50|$|Bartók {{also made}} use of pizzicato glissandi, {{executed}} by plucking a note and then sliding the <b>stopping</b> <b>finger</b> up or down the string. This technique {{can be heard in}} his Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta.|$|R
25|$|Artificial {{harmonics}} {{are more}} difficult to produce than natural harmonics, as they involve both stopping the string and playing a harmonic on the stopped note. Using the octave frame (the normal distance between the first and fourth fingers in any given position) with the fourth finger just touching the string a fourth higher than the stopped note produces the fourth harmonic, two octaves above the <b>stopped</b> note. <b>Finger</b> placement and pressure, as well as bow speed, pressure, and sounding point are all essential in getting the desired harmonic to sound. And to add to the challenge, in passages with different notes played as false harmonics, the distance between <b>stopping</b> <b>finger</b> and harmonic finger must constantly change, since the spacing between notes changes {{along the length of the}} string.|$|R

6000|$|... "Owee! oweeeee! Caesar bit me," [...] she wailed. Then she <b>stopped,</b> with <b>finger</b> in her mouth, while Caesar {{scrambled}} {{headlong into}} the tide; for Noel {{was standing on}} the beach pointing at a brown sail far down in the deep bay, where Southeast Brook came singing from the green wilderness.|$|R
50|$|The {{notes on}} the D string (E and F natural) would be fingered as normal (first finger and low second), but the fingerings given above the second measure would be 1040 2040 1040, {{indicating}} the switch (bariolage) from open A string to the <b>stopped</b> fourth <b>finger</b> on the D string, also playing the note A.|$|R
60|$|He said nothing; {{but there}} was {{something}} so fretful and impatient in his change of position, that her quick <b>fingers</b> <b>stopped,</b> and she looked at him anxiously.|$|R
60|$|He {{opened the}} gate, and led my mustang {{into the road}} and quite some distance. The pony jogged along after us. Then Buell <b>stopped</b> with a <b>finger</b> outstretched.|$|R
50|$|Early dials {{worked by}} direct or forward action. The pulses were {{generated}} as the dial {{turned toward the}} <b>finger</b> <b>stop</b> position. When the user's hand motion was erratic, it produced wrong numbers. In the late 19th century, the dial was refined to operate automatically by a recoil spring. The user selected the digit to be dialed, rotated the dial to the <b>finger</b> <b>stop,</b> then released it. The spring caused the dial to rotate back to its home position during which time constant speed was maintained with a centrifugal governor.|$|R

25|$|The Erhu {{has some}} unusual features. First {{is that its}} {{characteristic}} sound is produced through the vibration of the python skin by bowing. Second, there is no fingerboard; the player stops the strings by pressing their fingertips onto the strings without the strings touching the neck. Third, the horse hair bow is never separated from the strings (which were formerly of twisted silk but which today are usually made of metal); it passes between them as opposed to over them (the latter being the case with western bowed stringed instruments). Lastly, although there are two strings, they {{are very close to}} each other and the player's left hand in effect plays as if on one string. The inside string (nearest to player) is generally tuned to D4 and the outside string to A4, a fifth higher. The maximum range of the instrument is three and a half octaves, from D4 up to A7, before a <b>stopping</b> <b>finger</b> reaches the part of the string in contact with the bow hair. The usual playing range is {{about two and a half}} octaves.|$|R

50|$|On {{the rotary}} dial, the digits are {{arranged}} in a circular layout so that a finger wheel may be rotated with one finger from the position of each digit to a fixed stop position, implemented by the <b>finger</b> <b>stop,</b> which is a mechanical barrier to prevent further rotation.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{bluegrass}} bands {{typically do}} not have a drummer, and the timekeeping role is shared between several instruments. The upright bass generally plays the on-beats, while the banjo keeps a steady eighth-note rhythm. The mandolin plays chop chords on the off-beats or upbeats. (see: boom-chick) By partially relaxing the fingers of the left hand soon after strumming, the strings are allowed to rise off the frets, and their oscillations are damped by the fingers. All strings are <b>stopped</b> or <b>fingered,</b> open strings are not played in chop chords.|$|R
60|$|Dick <b>stopped</b> short. His <b>finger</b> had {{run across}} the lining in a certain way. There were three clicks in rapid succession, and on the instant one of the brass plates of the box flew back, {{revealing}} a tiny compartment behind it, not {{over a quarter of}} an inch in depth.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>stopped,</b> {{with her}} <b>fingers</b> still lifting {{a lock of}} his hair. [...] "Why, yes, you silly--why shouldn't he? I'd {{like to see him}} refuse. Why, Lord! Jim will do {{anything}} I ask him." [...] She put down the lock of hair, and suddenly looking full into his eyes, said, [...] "That's just the difference between him and me, and you and--that woman!" ...|$|R
60|$|As {{those who}} have sojourned in the bush of that country know, one can sup on reasty pork and green tea alone, when it is {{impossible}} to get anything better, but there are more appetizing compounds, and when the edge of his appetite had been blunted, Alton <b>stopped</b> with greasy <b>fingers</b> in the frypan and a little smile upon his face.|$|R
50|$|Strowger also {{filed the}} first patent for a rotary dial in 1891. The first dials worked by direct, forward action. The pulses were sent as the user rotated the dial to the <b>finger</b> <b>stop</b> {{starting}} {{at a different}} position for each digit transmitted. Operating the dial error-free required smooth rotary motion of the finger wheel by the user, but was found as too unreliable. This mechanism was soon refined to include a recoil spring and a centrifugal governor to control the recoil speed. The user selected a digit to be dialed by inserting a finger into the corresponding hole and rotated the dial to the <b>finger</b> <b>stop.</b> When released from this position, the dial pulsing contacts were opened and closed repeatedly, thus interrupting the loop current in a pattern on the return to the home position. The exchange switch decoded the pattern for each digit thus transmitted by stepping relays or by accumulation in digit registers.|$|R
50|$|In music, {{a double}} stop {{refers to the}} {{technique}} of playing two notes simultaneously on a bowed stringed instrument such as a violin, a viola, a cello, or a double bass. In performing a double stop, two separate strings are bowed or plucked simultaneously. Although the term itself suggests these strings are to be <b>fingered</b> (<b>stopped),</b> in practice one or both strings may be open.|$|R
6000|$|... "But to return. He {{followed}} {{me down the}} corridor, and, as we turned the corner, trod on the lace of my petticoat. What could I do but cry 'Ah!' and <b>stop</b> to <b>finger</b> it? At which he drew his sword, made passes {{as if he were}} stabbing something to death, and cried, 'Mad! Mad! Mad!' Whereupon I screamed, and the Prince, who was writing in the large vellum book in the oriel window, came out in his velvet skull-cap and furred slippers, snatched a rapier from the wall--the King of Spain's gift, you know--on which I escaped, flinging on this cloak to hide the ravages to my skirt--to hide.... But listen! the horns!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The bowed string {{instrument}} musical technique bariolage ( [...] or, since {{the word is}} a noun rather than an adjective, [...] "odd mixture of colours", from the verb barioler, [...] "to streak with several colors") involves, [...] "the alternation of notes on adjacent strings, {{one of which is}} usually open", exploiting, [...] "the individual timbre of the various strings." [...] This may involve quick alternation between a static note and changing notes, that form a melody either above or below the static note. The static note is usually an open string note, which creates a highly resonant sound. [...] "Bariolage" [...] is a nineteenth-century term for an eighteenth-century violin technique (requiring flexibility in the wrist and forearm), the mechanics of which are not discussed by nineteenth-century writers. The usual bowing technique required, which also may be used separately from bariolage, is called ondulé in French or ondeggiando In Italian. However, it may also be executed with separate bow strokes. In bluegrass fiddling the technique is known as [...] "cross-fingering". Perhaps looking back on what he considered an earlier, less advanced, time, one pedagogue explains that The name bariolage is given to the kind of passage which presents the appearance of disorder and oddness, in that the notes are not played in succession on the same string where one would expect this or when the notes e, a, d, are played not on the same string but alternately with one <b>stopped</b> <b>finger</b> and the open string, or else finally when the open string is played in a position where a stopped note would normally be required.

50|$|In 1968, Woodin faced street fighter Arnold Spurling in a shoot {{fight in}} Columbus, Georgia. After Woodin {{dominated}} Spurling with amateur wrestling holds, Spurling bit off {{part of one}} of Woodin's fingers. The finger was subsequently surgically reattached, but Woodin did not regain full use of it. Later that year, Woodin challenged NWA World Heavyweight Champion Gene Kiniski, with the bout being <b>stopped</b> after Woodin's <b>finger</b> began bleeding.|$|R
5000|$|A tone hole is {{an opening}} in the body of a wind {{instrument}} which, when alternately closed and opened, changes the pitch of the sound produced. Tone holes may serve specific purposes, such as a trill hole or register hole. A tone hole is, [...] "in wind instruments, a hole that may be <b>stopped</b> by the <b>finger,</b> or a key, to change the pitch of the tone produced." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{telephones}} {{include a}} small dial {{built into the}} handset, with a movable <b>finger</b> <b>stop.</b> The user rotates the dial clockwise until the <b>finger</b> <b>stop</b> ceases moving, then releases both. In this design the holes extend around the full circumference of the dial, allowing a reduced diameter. This was introduced by Western Electric on the compact Trimline telephone, the first to locate the dial in the handset. In Spain, such phones were manufactured for CTNE (Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España) by Málaga-based factory [...] "CITESA", being named as [...] "Góndola" [...] phones by its particular shape. Spanish Góndola sets were fitted from the beginning with a red LED series connected with the line, allowing the dial ("disco" [...] in Spanish) to be back-lighted while dialling. For that, the LED was bridged by an anti-parallel Zener diode, to allow the DC to pass even if the line polarity were reversed. In case of line polarity reversal, the LED would not light, but the phone would work anyway. The LED and Zener diode were contained in the same package for ease of assembly in manufacturing.|$|R
50|$|For this reason, {{the numbers}} on the dial are shifted in {{different}} countries, or even in different areas of one country, to work with their system because of the difference of the number arrangement on the dial. The dial numbering can occur in four different formats, with 0 adjacent either to the 1 or the 9, and the numbers running in ascending or descending order, with either the 0, 1 or 9 being closest to the <b>finger</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{a soldier}} points, he instinctively {{points at the}} feature on the object on which his eyes are focused. An impulse from the brain causes the arm and hand to <b>stop</b> when the <b>finger</b> reaches the proper position. When the eyes are shifted to a new object or feature, the finger, hand, and arm also shift to this point. It is this {{inherent}} trait {{that can be used}} by the soldier to rapidly and accurately engage targets.|$|R
