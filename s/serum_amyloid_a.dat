Coimmunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays with transfected HEK 293 cells revealed constitutive dimerization of the receptors; significantly, AnxA 1, but not <b>serum</b> <b>amyloid</b> protein <b>A,</b> could activate ALX homodimers.

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The acute-phase proteins, <b>serum</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>As</b> (SAA), are {{precursors}} of <b>amyloid</b> <b>A,</b> {{involved in}} the pathogenesis of AA amyloidosis. This work started with the characterisation of systemic AA amyloidosis concurrent with SAA overexpression in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) of an obese patient with a leptin receptor deficiency. In the present study a series of histopathological, cellular and gene expression studies was performed to assess the importance of SAA in common obesity and its possible production by mature adipocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiling was performed in the sWAT of two extremely obese patients with a leptin receptor deficiency. Levels of the mRNAs of the different SAA isoforms were quantified in sWAT cellular fractions from lean subjects and from obese subjects before and after a very-low-calorie diet. These values were subsequently compared with serum levels of SAA in these individuals. In addition, histopathological analyses of sWAT were performed in lean and obese subjects. RESULTS: In sWAT, the expression of SAA is more than 20 -fold higher in mature adipocytes than in {{the cells of the}} stroma vascular fraction (p< 0. 01). Levels of SAA mRNA expression and circulating levels of the protein are sixfold (p< 0. 001) and 3. 5 -fold (p< 0. 01) higher in obese subjects than in lean subjects, respectively.

50|$|Positive acute-phase {{proteins}} serve (part of {{the innate}} immune system) different physiological functions for the immune system.

Others give negative {{feedback on the}} inflammatory response, e.g. serpins. Alpha 2-macroglobulin and coagulation factors affect coagulation, mainly stimulating it.

FPR2, {{which is now}} termed the ALX, ALX/FPR, or ALX/FPR2 receptor, is a G protein coupled receptor initially identified as a receptor for the leukocyte chemotactic factor, N-Formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), based on its amino acid sequence similarity to the known FMLP receptor, FPR1. At least six homologues of this receptor are found in mice.

5000|$|According to this theory, {{the most}} {{important}} for stimulation of immune response are normal tissues. When tissue cells are distressed because of injury, infection and so on, they start to secrete or express on their surface so called [...] "Danger signals".

This model also dictates that despite their potential immunogenicity tumors do not induce significant immune responses which could destroy malignant cells.

Both SAA1 and SAA2 are induced up to a 1000-fold in mice under acute inflammatory conditions following exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). [...] Three A-SAA genes have also been identified in humans, although the third gene, SAA3, is believed to represent a pseudogene that does not generate messenger RNA or protein.

We demonstrate that <b>serum</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>A</b> 1 α more potently chemoattracts neutrophils in vivo than in vitro. In contrast to CD 14 (+) monocytes, no rapid (within 2 h) induction of interleukin- 8 /CXC chemokine ligand 8 or macrophage-inflammatory protein- 1 α/CC chemokine ligand 3 was observed in purified human neutrophils after stimulation of the cells with <b>serum</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>A</b> 1 α or lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, interleukin- 8 /CXC chemokine ligand 8 induction in monocytes by <b>serum</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>A</b> 1 α was mediated by toll-like receptor 2 and was inhibited by association of <b>serum</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>A</b> 1 α with high density lipoprotein. This indicates that the potent chemotactic response of neutrophils toward intraperitoneally injected <b>serum</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>A</b> 1 α is indirectly enhanced by rapid induction of chemokines in peritoneal cells, synergizing in a paracrine manner with <b>serum</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>A</b> 1 α. We observed direct synergy between IL- 8 /CXC chemokine ligand 8 and <b>serum</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>A</b> 1 α, but not lipopolysaccharide, in chemotaxis and shape change assays with neutrophils. Furthermore, the selective CXC chemokine receptor 2 and formyl peptide receptor 2 antagonists, SB 225002 and WRW 4, respectively, blocked the synergy between IL- 8 /CXC chemokine ligand 8 and <b>serum</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>A</b> 1 α in neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro, indicating that for synergy their corresponding G protein-coupled receptors are required. Additionally, SB 225002 significantly inhibited <b>serum</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>A</b> 1 α-mediated peritoneal neutrophil influx.
