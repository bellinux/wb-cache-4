5|$|At 05:10, four German torpedo boats {{reached the}} Eastern Task Force and {{launched}} fifteen torpedoes, sinking the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS Svenner off Sword beach but missing the battleships HMS Warspite and Ramillies. After attacking, the German vessels {{turned away and}} fled east into a smoke <b>screen</b> <b>that</b> had been laid by the RAF to shield the fleet from the long-range battery at Le Havre. Allied losses to mines included USS Corry off Utah and USS PC-1261, a 173-foot patrol craft. In addition, many landing craft were lost.|$|E
5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would not suffer the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on <b>screen</b> <b>that</b> he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite {{the simplicity of the}} scene.|$|E

5|$|On 15 October 2011, {{the stadium}} {{was open to}} Welsh Rugby Union fans free of charge, {{providing}} that they wear red {{so that they could}} watch a live screening of the 2011 Rugby World Cup semi-final between Wales and France that was played at Eden Park, Auckland, New Zealand. The match was screened on the stadium's existing large screens, on all of their television screens and on a <b>screen</b> <b>that</b> was brought in for the occasion. The same was done for the Bronze Final between Wales and Australia which saw Wales defeated and take fourth place.|$|E
5|$|Sega {{released}} a combined, semi-portable Genesis/Sega CD unit called the Genesis CDX (marketed as the Multi-Mega in Europe). This unit retailed at $399.95 in the U.S. (roughly $100 {{more than the}} individual Genesis and Sega CD units put together, since the Sega CD dropped its price to $229 half a year before), and was bundled with Sonic CD, Sega Classics Arcade Collection, and the Sega CD version of Ecco the Dolphin. The CDX features a small LCD <b>screen</b> <b>that,</b> when the unit is used to play audio CDs, displays the current track being played. With this feature and the system's lightweight build (weighing two pounds), Sega marketed it in part as a portable CD player.|$|E
5|$|St Andrew's Church {{dates from}} the 12th century with a large 15th century pinnacled {{sandstone}} tower, a Norman font and a rood <b>screen</b> <b>that</b> is the full width of the church. In the church are several memorials to the Stracheys of Sutton Court together with a wooden effigy of a Knight cross-legged and leaning on one elbow, in 15th century armour, thought to be of Sir John de Hauteville or a descendant, and possibly transferred from a church at Norton Hautville before it was demolished.|$|E

5|$|The playable {{character}} can lead {{a group of}} three additional allies into battle, controlling their actions to attack a single enemy or to use specific powers. Characters can be set to one of three modes: defensive, neutral, or offensive. In defensive mode, the character remains distant from battles, while offensive mode sends the character directly into battle. The main character and active allies are represented by portraits on <b>screen</b> <b>that</b> reflect their current physical or emotional state, showing sadness, anger, feeding, or the presence of injuries or staking—having been stabbed through the heart and rendered immobile.|$|E
5|$|The two {{travel through}} more zones and fight Eggman {{at the end}} of each one. They follow Eggman to a forest, where he leads a massive logging operation. Together with Mighty the Armadillo, they destroy his {{machinery}} and stop the operation. They continue through the forest and find ghosts that frighten Tails. Destroying one of Eggman's robots lets Sonic see its internal architecture, including a <b>screen</b> <b>that</b> shows Eggman's plans to create an empire and drop a floating island into the sea.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} special effects, {{including}} smoke machines and fireworks that erupted during the show. There {{was a giant}} projection <b>screen</b> <b>that</b> resembled the magical mirror from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Also present was a mechanical magic carpet in which Spears sat and flew over the first 100 feet above the crowd. Spears, who had five costumes changes during the show, was joined on stage by eight dancers. The setlist consisted of nine songs, seven from her debut album and two unreleased songs from her then upcoming album, Oops!... I Did It Again (2000).|$|E

5|$|Wohlwend {{began to}} {{collaborate}} with Asher Vollmer when Vollmer reached out to Wohlwend for aesthetic advice on a game he was designing, Puzzlejuice. The game {{has been compared to}} a cross between Boggle, Tetris, and tile-matching, where tetromino blocks fall {{from the top of the}} <b>screen</b> <b>that</b> players turn into letters and rearrange into words. Wohlwend and Vollmer communicated nonverbally through the entire development process via a 365-message email chain. Vollmer served as the game's programmer, Wohlwend as the artist, and Jimmy Hinson as the composer. Puzzlejuice was selected for the PAX 10, a spotlighted group of indie games, in July 2012. It was released as a universal app for iPhone and iPad on January 19, 2012.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} Pokémon {{role-playing}} games released for handheld consoles, FireRed and LeafGreen are in third-person, overhead perspective. The main screen is an overworld, {{in which the}} player navigates the protagonist. Here a menu interface may be accessed, in which the player may configure his or her Pokémon, items, and gameplay settings. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle <b>screen</b> <b>that</b> displays the player's Pokémon and the engaged Pokémon. During a battle, the player may select a move {{for his or her}} Pokémon to perform, use an item, switch his or her active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. All Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, all of the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive a certain amount of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon may level up.|$|E
5|$|John pleads with General Ashdown {{to delay}} the {{offensive}} so he can formulate a plan to extract the human captives, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, the Resistance disobeys Ashdown's orders and instead, await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables perimeter defenses so that Connor can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners. Wright learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a <b>screen),</b> <b>that</b> he was created and built from the original Wright's corpse to lure John to the base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish in the past. The hidden signal that the Resistance received earlier is revealed {{to have been a}} ruse, and Skynet uses it to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance's leaders aboard.|$|E

5|$|Space Race is a two-player arcade game. In the game, the {{two players}} each control a spaceship, which they fly {{from the bottom}} of the screen to the top. Along the way are dashes {{representing}} asteroids moving across the screen from left to right, which the players must avoid. Movement controls are limited to moving the spaceship up or down; if the player's ship is hit by an asteroid it disappears for a few seconds before reappearing at the bottom again. The game displays a starfield in the background, as well as each player's score, which increases whenever a player makes it to the top first. Each game is for a set amount of time, represented by a line in the bottom middle of the <b>screen</b> <b>that</b> shortens during the game, with the winner being the player with the higher score when time runs out. Each game costs a quarter. Machines can be set to play one or two rounds per game, and the time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 45 seconds to 3 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The final Computer Space design uses no {{microprocessor}} or memory; {{the entire}} computer {{system is a}} state machine made of 74-series TTL chips, with graphic elements held in diode arrays. The array designs, which Bushnell designed to let him rotate the rocket in 16 directions with only 4 arrays, are {{laid out in the}} shape of the ships, which made it obvious to game operators what would need to be replaced if something broke. The ships themselves are projected on the screen as a pattern of dots, rather than connected lines, and the monitor they are projected on is a General Electric 15-inch black and white television screen, specially modified for the game. The rudimentary artificial intelligence constructed by Bushnell has the enemy ships firing towards the quadrant of the <b>screen</b> <b>that</b> the player's rocket is in, rather than a more complicated tracking algorithm.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Mega Man {{series on}} the NES has generally consisted of 2D platform games that focus on run-and-gun gameplay. Mega Man X uses the same basic principles as its precursors but with many added options. The player takes control of the protagonist X, and, after completing an introductory stage, is presented with a stage selection <b>screen</b> <b>that</b> depicts eight boss characters. Each stage is littered with various enemies and hazards and ends with a boss battle against its respective Maverick. Completing a stage rewards the player with a new weapon. The player may attempt these eight levels in any order, using weapons gained in one level to overcome challenges in the others. The player can return to the game at a later point using a password system; the password will retain any number of the eight stages cleared and most power-ups. Completing some stages will subtly affect the landscape of others. For example, clearing Storm Eagle's aircraft carrier stage will cause electrical outages in Spark Mandrill's power plant stage. In certain stages, X can hop inside Ride Armors to fight enemies. Ride Armors are bipedal tanks capable of powerful punches.|$|E
