These rights, defined in Part III of the Constitution, apply {{irrespective}} of race, place of birth, religion, caste, creed, or gender.

These provisions, set out in Part IV of the Constitution, are not enforceable by the courts, but the principles on which they are based are fundamental guidelines for governance that the State is expected to apply in framing and passing law's.|$|E
5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as <b>specific</b> <b>restrictions</b> on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E

While the legislators {{made it very clear}} they expected the WACs to be noncombatants, the bill contained no <b>specific</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Existing Army regulations still prohibited them from combat training with weapons, tactical exercises, duty assignments requiring weapons, supervising men, and jobs requiring great physical strength, unless waived by the United States Secretary of War; but of the 628 Army specialties, women now qualified for 406.

25|$|Since many {{countries}} heavily restrict the civilian possession of ammunition and ammunition components, including primers and smokeless powder, handloading may be explicitly or implicitly illegal in certain countries. Even without <b>specific</b> <b>restrictions</b> on powder and primers, {{they may be}} covered under other laws governing explosive materials. Handloading may require study and passing an exam to acquire a handloading permit prior to being allowed to handload ammunition in some jurisdictions. This is done to avoid catastrophic accidents caused by lack of knowledge/skill as much as possible, and also allows the government to maintain information on who reloads their own cartridges. The standards organization C.I.P. rules that the products of handloaders that do not comply with the C.I.P. ammunition approval rules for commercial ammunition manufacturers cannot be legally sold in C.I.P. member states.|$|E
25|$|Transhumanists do not {{necessarily}} rule out <b>specific</b> <b>restrictions</b> on emerging technologies so as to lessen the prospect of existential risk. Generally, however, they counter that proposals based on the precautionary principle are often unrealistic and sometimes even counter-productive {{as opposed to the}} technogaian current of transhumanism, which they claim is both realistic and productive. In his television series Connections, science historian James Burke dissects several views on technological change, including precautionism and the restriction of open inquiry. Burke questions the practicality of some of these views, but concludes that maintaining the status quo of inquiry and development poses hazards of its own, such as a disorienting rate of change and the depletion of our planet's resources. The common transhumanist position is a pragmatic one where society takes deliberate action to ensure the early arrival of the benefits of safe, clean, alternative technology, rather than fostering what it considers to be anti-scientific views and technophobia.|$|E

Even controversial subjects are addressed in romance novels, including topics such as date rape, domestic violence, addiction, and disability.

2500|$|From 1912 to 1927 the Department of Commerce {{regulated}} U.S. radio, {{and initially}} {{there were no}} <b>specific</b> <b>restrictions</b> on stations wanting to engage in broadcasting entertainment to the general public.

At the time this regulation was adopted {{a small number of}} stations already met the new requirements, although this did not include KQV, which although it held a Limited Commercial license, wasn't authorized to transmit on either of the broadcasting wavelengths. On January 9, 1922 Doubleday-Hill was issued a new Limited Commercial license for KQV, which now included an authorization to transmit on the 360 meter entertainment wavelength.

2500|$|All nine {{laws have}} similar content. [...] They all {{restrict}} corporate ability {{to own and}} operate on farmland. [...] They all outline exceptions for specific types of corporations.

However, the laws vary significantly in how they define a corporate farm, and in the <b>specific</b> <b>restrictions.</b> [...] Definitions of a farm can include any and all farm operations, or be dependent on the source of income, as in Iowa, where 60 percent of income must come from farm products. [...] Additionally, these laws can target a corporation's use of the land, meaning that companies can own but not farm the land, or they may outright prohibit corporations from buying and owning farmland. [...] The precise wording of these laws has significant impact on how corporations can participate in agriculture in these states with the ultimate goal of protecting and empowering the family farm.|$|E
