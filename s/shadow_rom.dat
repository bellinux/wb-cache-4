50|$|It has two {{different}} address spaces {{and the ability}} to quickly switch between them. They were used in implementing the FIS instruction subset, with instructions processed not in microcode, but as interrupt handlers in <b>shadow</b> <b>ROM.</b>|$|E
50|$|Write-combining allows bus write {{transfers}} {{to be combined}} into a larger transfer before bursting them over the bus to allow more efficient writes to system resources like graphics card memory. This often increases the speed of image write operations by several times, {{at the cost of}} losing the simple sequential read/write semantics of normal memory. Additional bits which are provided on some computer architectures, such as AMD64, allow the shadowing of ROM contents in system memory (<b>shadow</b> <b>ROM),</b> and the configuration of memory-mapped I/O.|$|E
50|$|As {{a common}} example, the BIOS in typical {{personal}} computers often has an option called “use shadow BIOS” or similar. When enabled, functions relying {{on data from}} the BIOS’s ROM will instead use DRAM locations (most can also toggle shadowing of video card ROM or other ROM sections). Depending on the system, this may not result in increased performance, and may cause incompatibilities. For example, some hardware may be inaccessible to the operating system if shadow RAM is used. On some systems the benefit may be hypothetical because the BIOS is not used after booting in favor of direct hardware access. Free memory is reduced {{by the size of}} the <b>shadowed</b> <b>ROMs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Up to 192 kB of RAM and 20 kB of ROM (16 kB on the {{smallest}} model) on a 16 bit address bus was implemented using special hardware. As a consequence, certain RAM areas <b>shadowed</b> by <b>ROM</b> {{could only be}} used for data storage and the video memory had a green and alternative green bank that could be switched by a hardware register.|$|R
50|$|On many systems {{including}} modern ones it {{is possible}} to use memory reserved for <b>shadowing</b> expansion card <b>ROM</b> as upper memory. Many chipsets reserve up to 384 KB RAM for this purpose and since this RAM is generally unused it may be used as real mode upper memory with a custom device driver, such as UMBPCI.|$|R
5000|$|The unit {{can have}} up to 16 MB RAM installed. The unit sported a [...] "Turbo" [...] switch which, when enabled, clocked a Commodore 64 or Commodore 128 up to 20 MHz. The unit plugs into the {{expansion}} port of the computer. The unit uses 0.4 A and <b>shadow</b> <b>ROM</b> in 128 kB of RAM. Internal ROM was 128 kB. Using the RamCard (SuperCard), fast page mode (FPM) not EDO memory modules with PS/2-SIMM socket {{can be used in}} the capacities of 1, 4, 8 or 16 MB.|$|E
