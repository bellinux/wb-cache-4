5|$|In March1866, a {{chain of}} banks owned by Charles Vernon Culver, a {{financier}} and member of United States House of Representatives for Pennsylvania's 20th congressional district, collapsed.

5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he <b>stopped</b> <b>coming</b> home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope.

25|$|The tide {{of foreign}} {{immigration}} receded, so that many groups had largely <b>stopped</b> <b>coming</b> {{by the beginning}} of the 20th century. Some, however, were just starting to immigrate. Southern and Eastern European immigration, especially from Italy and Croatia, began in not insignificant amounts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as they came to work in Iowan coal mines. The early 20th century also saw the start of significant immigration from Mexico, and the mid-1970s saw immigration from Southeast Asia (especially the Tai Dam, Vietnamese, and Lao) as refugees from the Vietnam War searched for a peaceful place to live.|$|E
25|$|Galbraith {{resigned}} as Stanley manager in 1958, and Bodle was {{considered for the}} job, but the experienced George Eastham was preferred. His tenure was brief, and in June 1959 Bodle was appointed manager. The club had no money, the team had become accustomed to losing, and the spectators <b>stopped</b> <b>coming.</b> The season ended in relegation with a Third Division record number of 123 goals conceded. The directors chose to dismiss Bodle and appoint captain Jimmy Harrower as player-manager in his place, purportedly because the club were unable to afford a non-playing manager. In 1974, after 14 years of running a grocery shop, Bodle returned to football management with Burton Albion. He {{took them to the}} semi-final of the FA Trophy in 1975 and resigned in February 1976.|$|E

25|$|Bodle {{played one}} first-team game {{for his new}} club before the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War put an end to League football. He made occasional appearances for the club in wartime competition, as well as guesting for Rotherham and Doncaster, for whom he scored 27 goals. He returned to Birmingham to play a full season (and score 16 goals) in the 1945–46 regional competition Football League South, which Birmingham won, and contributed three goals in their run to the FA Cup semifinal. By this time he was a fixture in the side. He scored 16 goals in all competitions in the first post-war League season– only Cyril Trigg got more for Birmingham– and 14 the following year, which made him the club's leading scorer and helped them to promotion back to the top flight. Once in the First Division Bodle's goals <b>stopped</b> <b>coming,</b> and in March 1949 the club accepted an offer for his services of £9,500 from Second Division Bury.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1700s the New France {{settlers}} were well established along {{the shores of}} the Saint Lawrence River and parts of Nova Scotia, with a population around 16,000. However new arrivals <b>stopped</b> <b>coming</b> from France in the proceeding decades, resulting in the English and Scottish settlers in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and the southern Thirteen Colonies to vastly outnumber the French population approximately ten to one by the 1750s. From 1670, through the Hudson's Bay Company, the English also laid claim to Hudson Bay and its drainage basin known as Rupert's Land establishing new trading posts and forts, while continuing to operate fishing settlements in Newfoundland. French expansion along the Canadian canoe routes challenged the Hudson's Bay Company claims, and in 1686, Pierre Troyes led an overland expedition from Montreal to the shore of the bay, where they managed to capture a handful of outposts. La Salle's explorations gave France a claim to the Mississippi River Valley, where fur trappers and a few settlers set up scattered forts and settlements.|$|E

500|$|Jason {{would not}} stay buried for long, as {{the success of}} The Final Chapter ensured another Friday the 13th film. Mancuso, Sr. stated, [...] "Quite simply, the public still wanted to see these films. So until they really <b>stopped</b> <b>coming,</b> why not {{continue}} to make more?" [...] A New Beginning shifted {{the focus of the}} story to the character of Tommy Jarvis and how he battles his inner demons, hallucinations, and [...] "rages to kill" [...] after his ordeal with Jason in The Final Chapter. This premise was not repeated, as the very next installment brought Jason back from the dead. Jason Lives attempted to create a [...] "funnier, faster, and more action-packed [...] Friday" [...] than had previously been done. The limited financial success of Jason Lives provided enough incentive to create another sequel, The New Blood. The idea proposed by screenwriter Daryl Haney stemmed from his realization that the films always ended with Jason battling the [...] "final girl". Haney decided that this final girl should have telekinetic powers, which led Producer Barbara Sachs to dub the film, Jason vs. Carrie.|$|E
500|$|A {{review of}} 919 peer-reviewed {{scientific}} studies investigating {{the effects of}} EMF on wildlife, humans and plants included seven studies involving honey bees; six of these reported negative effects from exposure to EMF radiation, but none specifically demonstrated any link to CCD. The review noted that according to one study, when active mobile phones were kept inside beehives, worker bees <b>stopped</b> <b>coming</b> to the hives after 10 days. The same study also found drastic decrease in the egg production of queen bees in these colonies and stated [...] "electromagnetic radiation exposure provides a better explanation for Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) than other theories". [...] The review authors concluded: [...] "existing literature shows that the EMRs are interfering with the biological systems {{in more ways than}} one" [...] and recommended recognising EMF as a pollutant. However, they also noted that [...] "these studies are not representative of the real life situations or natural levels of EMF exposure. More studies need to be taken up to scientifically establish the link, if any, between the observed abnormalities and disorders in bee hives such as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD)".|$|E
500|$|Despite being married, Beatrice {{fulfilled}} {{her promise}} to the Queen by continuing as her full-time confidante and secretary. Queen Victoria warmed to Henry, as she often did with other handsome, strong men. However, the Queen criticised Beatrice's conduct {{during her first}} pregnancy. When Beatrice <b>stopped</b> <b>coming</b> to the Queen's dinners a week before giving birth, preferring to eat alone in her room, the Queen wrote angrily to her physician, Dr James Reid, that, [...] "I [...] coming to dinner, and not simply moping in her own room, which is very bad for her. In my case I regularly came to dinner, except when I was really unwell (even when suffering a great deal) up to the very last day." [...] Beatrice, aided by chloroform, gave birth the following week to her first son, Alexander. Despite suffering a miscarriage {{in the early months}} of her marriage, Beatrice gave birth to four children: Alexander, called [...] "Drino", was born in 1886; Ena in 1887; Leopold in 1889 and Maurice in 1891. Following this, she took a polite and encouraging interest in social issues, such as conditions in the coal mines. However, this interest did not extend to changing the conditions of poverty, as it had done with her brother, the Prince of Wales.|$|E

500|$|After retiring, Friday {{moved back}} to London and {{returned}} to work as an asphalter and decorator. Soon after Friday left Cardiff, Reading manager Maurice Evans was presented with a petition, signed by 3,000 supporters, requesting that he attempt to re-sign Friday. Evans contacted Friday and told him: [...] "If you would just settle down {{for three or four}} years, you could play for England". Friday replied with the question [...] "How old are you?", and after Evans answered, continued: [...] "I'm half your age and I've lived twice your life". Evans reflected, [...] "You may well be right". Friday trained with Brentford during the 1978–79 pre-season, but after regaining his fitness suddenly changed his mind and <b>stopped</b> <b>coming</b> to training. He married for a third time in 1980, but was divorced again within three years. After a short time living back with his parents in Acton, Friday's family secured him a housing association flat in the area. He served a prison sentence during the 1980s for impersonating a police officer and confiscating people's drugs, and was found dead in his Acton flat on 22 December 1990 at the age of 38, having suffered a fatal heart attack. Biographer Paolo Hewitt claimed the incident {{to be the result of}} [...] "a suspected heroin overdose".|$|E
