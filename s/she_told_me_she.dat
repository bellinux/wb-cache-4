500|$|On February 18, 1995, Madonna {{arrived in}} Europe to promote Bedtime Stories. During the same day, she {{performed}} [...] "Secret" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on German TV show Wetten, dass..?, {{while she was}} also interviewed on the program. Madonna went back to United States and performed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on the American Music Awards of 1995, accompanied by Babyface and a full orchestra. Babyface said the performance was terrifying for him: [...] "I was nervous as hell. But you couldn't actually see my legs shaking under the suit. When we finished, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had never been that nervous before. That was crazy to me -- I was thinking, 'You're Madonna, you're on stage all the time!'". She returned to Europe and sang the song Sanremo Music Festival. At {{the end of the}} performance, she thanked the audience in Italian language, and received standing ovation. Madonna did rehearse the song for 2004's Re-Invention World Tour, but it was ultimately cut from the setlist and not included in the show.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the song}} was first released, Rick Melbourne, a breakfast radio announcer, {{produced}} a parody version of the song, including the lyrics [...] "God help me, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> was sixteen". Australian country singer John Williamson recorded a live version as [...] "Only 19" [...] and released it on his 1984 vinyl LP, The Smell of Gumleaves (rereleased in 1996 as a CD under the title Home Among the Gum Trees).|$|E
2500|$|Jobs's {{biological}} mother Schieble became pregnant {{with him in}} 1954 when she and Jandali spent the summer {{with his family in}} Homs, Syria. Jandali has stated that he [...] "was very much in love with Joanne ... but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry me, as I was from Syria. And so <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> wanted to give the baby up for adoption." [...] Jobs told his official biographer that Schieble's father was dying at the time, Schieble did not want to aggravate him, and both felt that at 23 they were too young to marry. In addition, as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother, and as abortions were illegal and dangerous, adoption was the only option women had in the United States in 1954. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: [...] "without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me ... {{she did not want to}} bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone." [...] Schieble put herself in the care of a [...] "doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me-- You can't {{understand}} what <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She's</b> been {{away with this}} young fellow once, and she said as much as that she'd go again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's them! Of course it's them!" [...] cried Mrs. Aleshine. [...] "I had a feelin' {{while we}} were scootin' {{downhill}} that they was {{near and dear to}} us, though exactly why and how, I didn't know. And <b>she's</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she's</b> Lucille, and of course the other must be Emily, though what relations--" ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. (Aside.) How the dickens should I {{know what}} <b>she</b> prefers? <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> doted on horses. (Aloud.) I think it is.|$|R
60|$|THE CAPTAIN [continuing unmoved]. She {{married a}} numskull. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> would marry anyone {{to get away}} from home.|$|E
60|$|After {{a little}} further {{conversation}} <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> was from London, and was down with her people for their holiday.|$|E
6000|$|... "Devoted, of course; {{she wished}} you {{to marry her}} candidate. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> was {{watching}} you only in order to interpose." ...|$|E
30|$|<b>She</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> {{does not}} love me because I am a {{shepherd}} and I save,Some day I will own the tiles of her roof.|$|R
30|$|My {{mother was}} the most {{influential}} person in making the decision of what my wedding dress should be because I trust her opinion more than anyone I know. …She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> exactly what I needed to hear, the truth. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> when <b>she</b> did not like a certain dress and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> when <b>she</b> loved a certain dress. She was the most honest person. I knew that, of everyone, {{she would be the}} one person to give me the best and most honest advice. I knew she would ultimately have my best interests at heart.|$|R
6000|$|Then he stopped, and chuckled in {{his usual}} dry manner. [...] "I {{was going to make}} Jordan the proposition--only I got to {{thinking}} and my nerve failed me. Guess I made my money hard in the free sealing days when we had trouble with everybody all the time, but I felt I'd sooner not offend Mrs. Jordan, and I might do it if I didn't fix things just as <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She's</b> a clever woman--but I don't want to have her on my trail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{came to see}} ME. She {{knocked at}} my shabby door. She mounted my squalid stair. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had seen you at Folkestone." ...|$|E
60|$|Fortunately she's {{taken it}} very well. I confess I {{was a little}} nervous when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> meant to stay on in Egypt to be near her son.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{give it to}} her, sir," [...] Adam said, [...] "and {{tell her}} your words. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> should {{come back to the}} people at the Hall Farm." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> {{was called}} Dian the Beautiful, {{and that she}} belonged to the tribe of Amoz, which dwells in the cliffs above the Darel Az, or shallow sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur is serious?" [...] he inquired. [...] "It {{is only a}} {{short time}} ago that I was talking with Mademoiselle Delora, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> was dining with you here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>she</b> did; <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> {{could read}} {{all sorts of}} things in my face, and offered, if I would give myself up to it, to make me more than human." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For Julia? Is Julia {{so great}} as that? <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had the {{greatest}} regard for you. You're {{good enough for the}} best, my dear boy," [...] Mr. Carteret pursued.|$|E
6000|$|Philammon blushed scarlet, but {{he dared}} not lie. 'There was a--a poor black woman, wounded and trodden down, and I dare not leave her, for <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> was a Christian.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{maternal}} Sellars waddled {{after us}} into the passage, which she completely blocked. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> was delight-ted to have met me, {{and that she was}} always at home on Sundays.|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] said Gilmore. [...] "It's all of no use, {{and you are}} troubling {{yourself}} for nothing. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> did not care a straw for me;--but she accepted me." ...|$|R
60|$|When Sophy had {{finished}} her tale, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> {{had left her}} boy in London, and had come down to devote herself to the task she had so long had before her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know that," [...] I said. [...] "I {{have seen}} her; <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what <b>she</b> did, and I treated her as I would treat {{a boy who}} had brushed my coat, but I shall make amends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{did think}} {{directly}} of asking her that," [...] says he; [...] "and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> was quite certain {{that there was}} no written evidence of the forgery except that one letter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is gone!" [...] he cried, with a gasp of relief. [...] "No, by heaven! {{there she}} is again, and nearer--coming nearer. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> would come for me, and she keeps her word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You did, and it so struck Jean that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> {{would rather}} be an old maid for life, 'the which,' she said, 'is a dismal prospect,' than marry out of the Auld Licht kirk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{she did not}} say that. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> had {{declined}} the honour that you had offered her;--that she did not regard you as she must regard the man to whom she would pledge her heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I found Anne in a {{state of}} the wildest grief. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> had seen Philip shot by the vicomte, just as he was attacking him, and that you in turn had cut down the villain.|$|R
60|$|I quite {{believed}} Leeby when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> afterwards that <b>she</b> {{had watched}} Jamie feeling beneath the mattress.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes; {{very near}} here. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had known this old house well years ago, {{when she was}} a girl. She used to visit it in company with her father, a friend of old Señor Cristoval.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Leland started, {{and there}} was no doubt that his concern was genuine. [...] "Oh," [...] he said, [...] "the thing's quite out of the question. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> was going to stay with us as long as we wanted her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "And <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> {{was no more}} a cook than my wife was; and {{she said}} she'd teach me to be playing my jokes on ladies; and she grabbed up her things and flew out of the room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} a stranger, Miss Champneyes," [...] Saton said, taking her unresisting hand in his. [...] "I hope {{that you are going}} in to see the Comtesse. Only this morning <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> was finding it appallingly lonely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{said nothing}} at first. Her hand turned {{suddenly}} from cold to hot, and {{closed with a}} quick pressure on mine. Her breathing became oppressed. When she spoke, it was with difficulty. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> nothing; <b>she</b> only put a question: ...|$|R
5000|$|Knight married Kellett in 1974, at her request, {{with the}} couple {{arriving}} at the service on her motorcycle with a very intoxicated Kellett on the pillion. As soon as they arrived, Knight's mother, Barbara, gave Kellett some advice:"The old girl mother said to me to watch out. 'You better watch this one or she'll fucking kill you. Stir her up the wrong way or do the wrong thing and you're fucked, don't ever think of playing up on her on her, she'll fuckin' kill you.' And that was her mother talking! <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she's</b> got something loose. She's got a screw loose somewhere." ...|$|R
