Diffractive effects can be pronounced at lower frequencies but are small at high frequencies.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. The {{objective of this}} study is to investigate structural <b>shadow</b> <b>zones</b> encountered in shipbuilding design using the I-DEAS (Integrated Design Engineering Analysis Software) software. The term 'shadow zone' refers to areas of low stress concentrations that are caused by lines of stress bending around structural discontinuities. Two ship design situations frequently encountered that result in <b>shadow</b> <b>zones</b> are hull girder penetrations and short structural longitudinal bulkheads. In both of these situations, a long-used rule of thumb is to construct a line with a slope of 1 : 4 originating from the. discontinuity that encompasses the area of low stress. The material within this line is then considered ineffective when computing the section modulus. This can prove to be expensive. However, powerful finite element analysis software is readily available that can analyze the <b>shadow</b> <b>zones</b> in greater detail and possibly minimize the area considered ineffective. This study uses the I-DEAS software to develop finite element models of the cited design situations for a U. S. Navy Frigate, FFG- 7 class of ship. It conducts a static structural linear analysis of the ship balanced on a trochoidal wave of height 1. 1 VL.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{particle}} shadowing by {{the lunar surface}} is examined. <b>Shadow</b> <b>zones</b> are obtained analytically for small-aperture detectors on an infinite flat surface and are shown {{to be in good}} agreement with those obtained by numerical trajectory tracing. The <b>shadow</b> <b>zones</b> cover about half of all possible external field orientations for a vertical detector, which may result in serious underestimations of the frequency of observation of a particular plasma region. Shadowing may cause wide variations between observed and actual pitch angle distributions even in the case of multiple- or large-aperture detectors. Since the particle flux can be considered approximately isotropic only for magnetic fields within 35 deg of the surface normal, the electron flux to the surface may be overestimated in current balance calculations ignoring the magnetic field direction. In addition, photoelectrons may be returned to the surface by the magnetic field...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a model for {{studying}} aftershock sequences that integrates Coulomb static stress change analysis, seismicity equations based on rate-state friction nucleation of earthquakes, slip of geometrically complex faults, and fractal-like, spatially heterogeneous models of crustal stress. In addition to modeling instantaneous aftershock seismicity rate patterns with initial clustering on the Coulomb stress increase areas and an approximately 1 /t diffusion back to the pre-mainshock background seismicity, the simulations capture previously unmodeled effects. These include production of {{a significant number of}} aftershocks in the traditional Coulomb stress <b>shadow</b> <b>zones</b> and temporal changes in aftershock focal mechanism statistics. The occurrence of aftershock stress <b>shadow</b> <b>zones</b> arises from two sources. The first source is spatially heterogeneous initial crustal stress, and the second is slip on geometrically rough faults, which produces localized positive Coulomb stress changes within the traditional stress <b>shadow</b> <b>zones.</b> Temporal changes in simulated aftershock focal mechanisms result in inferred stress rotations that greatly exceed the true stress rotations due to the main shock, even for a moderately strong crust (mean stress 50  MPa) when stress is spatially heterogeneous. This arises from biased sampling of the crustal stress by the synthetic aftershocks due to the non-linear dependence of seismicity rates on stress changes. The model indicates that one cannot use focal mechanism inversion rotations to conclusively demonstrate low crustal strength (≤ 10  MPa); therefore, studies of crustal strength following a stress perturbation may significantly underestimate the mean crustal stress state for regions with spatially heterogeneous stress...|$|R

40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} acoustic nonlinearity and diffraction on {{the propagation of}} intense acoustic waves in an inhomogeneous moving medium are investigated. A nonlinear parabolic equation that accounts for scalar inhomogeneity (spatial distribution of sound speed and density) and vector inhomogeneity (spatial distribution of medium velocity) is employed. Numerical solutions are obtained in two-dimensions using a frequency domain algorithm for both scalar and vector inhomogeneities. The results are compared with those obtained using ray theory (within the paradigm of nonlinear geometrical acoustics) in order to investigate the impact of diffraction on focusing in inhomogeneous media. It is shown that the prediction of caustics and <b>shadow</b> <b>zones</b> by nonlinear geometrical acoustics only partially corresponds to the regions {{of high and low}} pressure levels predicted with the nonlinear parabolic wave equation. The discrepancy between the results of the models increases for smaller size of inhomogeneities and for longer distances in randomly inhomogeneous media.

40|$|Results from shallow-water {{observational}} {{studies have}} shown acoustic field fluctuations in excess of 10 dB due primarily to non-linear internal solitary waves (ISWs). This work concentrates on three limitations ISWs pose to shallow-water acoustic propagation: anisotropy, quasi-deterministic-stochastic nature, and frequency dependence. These aspects are explored for low frequencies of 75 and 150 Hz {{through the development of}} a full-wave three-dimensional parabolic equation model in which a single ISW is introduced and rotated to achieve differing geometries between the ISW and acoustic transmission path. Two acoustic scattering regimes were found to exist: A horizontal refractive regime that generates very intense acoustic energy focusing and <b>shadow</b> <b>zones</b> near the ISW at range when the acoustic transmission path is nearly parallel to the ISW crest, and a vertical mode coupling regime producing moderate to strong acoustic energy focusing and <b>shadow</b> <b>zones</b> for all geometries. These three-dimensional patterns are similar for each frequency, but more intense for 150 Hz. The results dramatically show ISWs focus acoustic energy, dependent upon frequency and geometry, which may be exploitable in both a sonar performance and ambient noise modeling sense.
