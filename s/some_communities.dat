5|$|Even {{in areas}} where {{mortality}} was low, so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. <b>Some</b> <b>communities</b> closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places.|$|E
5|$|On Athas, {{the planet}} of the Dark Sun {{campaign}} setting, dwarves stand less than 5' tall and weigh nearly 200lbs. Each dwarf pursues a singular obsession, called a focus, that requires {{at least a week}} to complete. Athasian dwarves do not live underground, but <b>some</b> <b>communities</b> focus on unearthing long-lost dwarven strongholds. Physically, the dwarves of Athas are unique among their kind, having no hair at all. Athasian dwarves can breed with humans to produce muls, who are sterile offsprings that share the strength and resiliency of dwarves with the size of humans.|$|E

5|$|On St. Laurence's Day in 1500, Portuguese {{explorer}} Diogo Dias {{landed on}} the island and named it São Lourenço. Polo's name was preferred and popularized on Renaissance maps. No single Malagasy-language name predating Madagasikara appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island, although <b>some</b> <b>communities</b> had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{were known}} to the native people of Sumatra and Borneo for millennia. While <b>some</b> <b>communities</b> hunted them for food and decoration, others placed taboos on such practices. In central Borneo, some {{traditional}} folk beliefs consider it bad luck {{to look in the}} face of an orangutan. Some folk tales involve orangutans mating with and kidnapping humans. There are even stories of hunters being seduced by female orangutans.|$|E
5|$|The Malagasy {{ethnic group}} forms over 90percent of Madagascar's {{population}} and is typically divided into eighteen ethnic sub-groups.

Community colleges are generally publicly funded (usually by local cities or counties) and offer career certifications and part-time programs.|$|R
5|$|The {{growth for}} many towns was only temporary. Growth in <b>some</b> <b>communities</b> was often driven by {{exploitation}} of limited oil resources, so once wells ran dry or demand slowed, their populations rapidly declined. When Wortham's boom ended, the population crashed from its 1927 peak of 30,000 to 2,000 people in 1929. The population of Breckenridge {{dropped from a}} similar high to 7,569 in 1930.|$|E
5|$|The kings {{exempted}} <b>some</b> <b>communities</b> {{from the}} jurisdiction of the voivodes. The Diploma Andreanum, a royal charter of 1224, placed the territory of the Saxons between Broos (Szászváros, Orăștie) and Barót (Baraolt) under the authority of the Count of Hermannstadt (Nagyszeben, Sibiu), who was appointed by and directly subordinate to the monarchs. Likewise, a special royal official, the Count of the Székelys, administered the Székely community from around 1228. In the latter case, the two offices were united by custom in 1462: from then on each voivode was also appointed Count of the Székelys.|$|E

5|$|Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont {{declared}} a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts. Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left <b>some</b> <b>communities</b> without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in Saxtons River. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Congress passed must-carry regulations, which {{required}} cable carriers to allocate spectrum to local broadcasters. This affected {{the availability of}} C-SPAN in some areas, in particular C-SPAN2, as some providers chose to discontinue carriage of the channel altogether. Between 1993 and 1994, cable systems in 95 U.S. cities dropped or reduced broadcasts of C-SPAN and C-SPAN2, following {{the implementation of the}} must-carry regulations. Viewers protested these decisions, especially when the changes coincided with matters of local interest occurring in the House or Senate. <b>Some</b> <b>communities,</b> such as Eugene, Oregon and Alexandria, Virginia, were successful in restoring C-SPAN availability. C-SPAN availability was later restored as technological developments that resulted in the expansion of channel capacity on cable providers allowed for mandatory stations and the C-SPAN networks both to be broadcast.|$|E
5|$|In Tampico, {{near the}} {{location}} of the storm's second landfall, the streets were littered with fallen trees branches, utility poles, and billboards. Additionally, many roads were inundated with water, leaving some impassable. Nearby, over 700people fled their homes for shelter due to flooding in Ciudad Madero. One death occurred in Pueblo Viejo when a woman was crushed by a tree that fell on her house. Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship capsizing near Boca del Río and another after a person was caught in an undertow offshore Úrsulo Galván. Two landslides in northern Puebla left roads impassable, isolating <b>some</b> <b>communities</b> such as Tlatlauquitepec. Hundreds of homes were destroyed leaving 35,000people homeless and there was severe damage in Tuxpan, Tamiahua, Pueblo Viejo, Platon, Pánuco, Tampico Alto, and elsewhere along the coast of northeast Mexico.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the typhoon's extreme intensity, damage was somewhat limited in the Philippines due to the lower population density of the affected areas. Widespread flooding and landslides caused substantial disruptions to travel and isolated <b>some</b> <b>communities.</b> Thirty-four {{people were killed in}} various incidents, mostly from flooding. Nearly 365,000people were affected by the storm and losses amounted to 1.21billion PHP (US$31million). Winds along the periphery of Cimaron fanned a large wildfire near Hong Kong, and moisture from it fueled record-breaking rains in British Columbia, Canada. Relief efforts in the Philippines began soon after the storm's passage; however, two other storms struck the country in November, with one resulting in far greater damage. Following a request for international assistance in early December, more than US$10million was provided in relief aid to the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opinion was}} sharply divided. <b>Some</b> <b>communities</b> {{supported}} the rebellion {{for a variety}} of reasons. Others, including Gonzales, declared their loyalty to Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna's centralist government. Local leaders began calling for a Consultation to determine whether a majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step toward revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15. In the interim, many communities formed militias to protect themselves from a potential attack by military forces.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of writing}} has made {{language}} even {{more useful to}} humans. It {{makes it possible to}} store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in <b>some</b> <b>communities,</b> writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.|$|E
