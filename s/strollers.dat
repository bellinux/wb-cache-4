5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made to extend the trams with another center section, adding another axle and articulation, but these plans have been {{rejected}} by the company. Such a center section would be low-floor and give much easier access for <b>strollers</b> and wheelchairs, and allow the whole tram network to have step-free access. As of 2008, it was estimated that the SL79-series has about ten more years of service before it needs to be replaced. No plans {{have been made}} for new trams to be ordered.|$|E

40|$|Despite their wide usage, it has {{recently}} been suggested that <b>stroller</b> use may reduce physical activity levels of young children. However, {{there have been no}} studies on <b>stroller</b> use as it relates to physical activity outcomes. The objectives of this study were to understand the context of <b>stroller</b> use for young children and parents’ perceptions of the relationship between <b>stroller</b> use and their children’s physical activity. Parents of children 1 to 5 years of age were recruited through two sites of TARGet Kids!, a primary-care, practice-based research network in Toronto, Canada. Fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim and two independent reviewers conducted thematic analysis. A number of strategies were employed to ensure the trustworthiness of the data. Parents discussed reasons for <b>stroller</b> use (i. e., transportation; storage; leisure; supervision/confinement; parent physical activity; and sleep), factors that influence the decision to use a <b>stroller</b> (i. e., caregiver choice; convenience, timing, distance; family lifestyle; and child preference), and perceived impact of <b>stroller</b> use on physical activity (i. e., most parents did not recognize a connection between <b>stroller</b> use and physical activity). This study provides a context for researchers and policy makers to consider when developing <b>stroller</b> related physical activity guidelines for young children...|$|R

5|$|The Van Cortlandt Golf Course, {{which opened}} on July 6, 1895, with nine holes, is located {{centrally}} {{on the park}} grounds. Within a year, the course became very crowded and disorganized, with crowds behaving poorly. Rules were set in 1896, with golfers paying caddies 15 cents per round or 25 cents per two rounds. Only caddies with badges could be hired, and bicycles, baby <b>strollers,</b> horse-riding, and horse-drawn carriages were banned from the course.|$|E

He was selected in goal for the New York State Amateur League representative eleven to face the National Association Football League on New Year's Day 1914; his team lost 3–1. In June of that year, he returned to Scotland on the SS California. The liner ran aground off the coast of Ireland with more than a thousand passengers aboard, all of whom had to be transferred to other vessels to complete their crossing.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May, an {{immediate}} vigil and protest {{was launched in}} light of international reports of the shelling of Tamil civilians in the Sri Lanka Army-declared safe zone in which 378 civilians had been killed, while protesters claimed it to be nearly 3,000. The protest began on Spadina Avenue but abruptly spread past police cordons onto the Gardiner Expressway, a busy freeway in the city, bringing all vehicular traffic to a halt. The protesters, including {{women and children in}} <b>strollers,</b> said they would not stop blocking the Gardiner Expressway until they met with a representative from Premier Dalton McGuinty's office and got a promise for a clear course of action to stop the civil war in Sri Lanka. Police subsequently shut-down the Gardiner Expressway and Toronto's Don Valley Parkway, causing heavy traffic congestions throughout other Toronto streets and highways.|$|E
40|$|Running with a <b>stroller</b> {{provides}} an opportunity for parents to exercise near their child and counteract health declines experienced during early parenthood. Understanding biomechanical and physiological changes that occur when <b>stroller</b> running is needed to evaluate its health impact, yet the effects of <b>stroller</b> running have not been clearly presented. Here, three commonly used <b>stroller</b> pushing methods were investigated to detect potential changes in energetic cost and lower-limb kinematics. Sixteen individuals (M/F: 10 / 6) ran at self-selected speeds for 800 m under three <b>stroller</b> conditions (2 -Hands, 1 -Hand, and Push/Chase) and an independent running control. A significant decrease in speed (p = 0. 001) and stride length (p< 0. 001) was observed between the control and <b>stroller</b> conditions, however no significant change in energetic cost (p = 0. 080) or heart rate (p = 0. 393) was observed. Additionally, pushing method had a significant effect on speed (p = 0. 001) and stride length (p< 0. 001). These findings suggest that pushing technique influences <b>stroller</b> running speed and kinematics. These findings suggest specific fitness effects may be achieved through the implementation of different pushing methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In sidewalks, slopes for vehicle {{crossings}} {{are often}} installed, and pedestrians {{have to walk}} across these slopes. The present study examined the influences of slope gradients on the danger and physical strain during <b>stroller</b> locomotion. Nine female participants walked forward while pushing a <b>stroller</b> with a dummy baby on a mock sidewalk with 1) a cross slope (the whole surface of the sidewalk tilted sideways) at gradients of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 15 %, and 2) combined slopes connecting a cross slope at gradients of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 15 % and a flat 0 % area. The velocity and tracks of the <b>stroller,</b> the pressure between the palm and the <b>stroller</b> handle, and an electromyogram (EMG) of the upper limbs of the participant were measured during <b>stroller</b> locomotion. Throughout both the cross and the combined slopes, the participants decreased their locomotion velocity according {{to the increase in}} the slope gradient. The steeper slope led the <b>stroller</b> to drift off-course to the downhill direction and caused increased pressure between the palm of the participant and the handle and increased EMG values, especially in the forearms. The results indicated that, on a sidewalk with a steeper cross slope, it is difficult for <b>stroller</b> users to maintain their intended course, even if they decrease their locomotion velocity and make their greater physical effort...|$|R
5|$|West Bromwich Albion Football Club {{was founded}} as West Bromwich <b>Strollers</b> in 1878 by workers from George Salter's Spring Works and turned {{professional}} in 1885. Albion won the FA Cup {{for the first}} time in 1888 and later that year became one of the founder members of the Football League. In the 190001 season, the club moved to its current home ground, The Hawthorns. Albion have spent the majority of their history in the top division of English football, including 24seasons in a row between 194950 and 197273. From 198687 to 200102, they spent 16consecutive seasons outside the top division, recording their lowest ever league finish of seventh in Division Three in 199192. Albion have been promoted 10 times and relegated 10 times, with 7 of the 20 changes of division coming between 2002 and 2010.

5|$|The {{club was}} founded as West Bromwich <b>Strollers</b> in 1878 by workers from George Salter's Spring Works in West Bromwich, in Staffordshire. They were renamed West Bromwich Albion in 1880, {{becoming}} {{the first team to}} adopt the Albion suffix; Albion was a district of West Bromwich where some of the players lived or worked, close to what is today Greets Green. The club joined the Birmingham & District Football Association in 1881 and became eligible for their first competition, the Birmingham Cup. They reached the quarter-finals, beating several longer-established clubs on the way. In 1883, Albion won their first trophy, the Staffordshire Cup. Albion joined the Football Association in the same year; this enabled them to enter the FA Cup {{for the first time in}} the 1883–84 season. In 1885 the club turned professional, and in 1886 they reached the FA Cup final for the first time, losing 2–0 to Blackburn Rovers in a replay. They reached the final again in 1887, but lost 2–0 to Aston Villa. In 1888 the team won the trophy for the first time, beating strong favourites Preston North End 2–1 in the final. As FA Cup winners, they qualified to play in a Football World Championship game against Scottish Cup winners Renton, which ended in a 4–1 defeat.|$|E
