40|$|The <b>selective</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> macroautophagy remains poorly defined. Here {{we report}} that PDGFR {{signaling}} is an essential selective promoter of hypoxia-induced macroautophagy. Hypoxia-induced macroautophagy in tumor cells is also HIF 1 alpha-dependent, with HIF 1 alpha integrating signals from PDGFRs and oxygen tension. Inhibition of PDGFR signaling reduces HIF 1 alpha half-life, despite buffering of steady-state protein levels by a compensatory increase in HIF 1 alpha mRNA. This markedly changes HIF 1 alpha protein pool dynamics, and consequently reduces the HIF 1 alpha transcriptome.

40|$|Background: <b>Selective</b> spatial <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> gene {{expression}} {{lies at the}} core of pattern formation in the embryo. In the fruit fly Drosophila, localized transcriptional regulation accounts for much of the embryonic pattern. Results: We identified a gene, partner of paired (ppa), whose properties suggest that localized receptors for protein degradation are integrated into regulatory networks of transcription factors to ensure robust spatial <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> {{gene expression}}. We found that the Ppa protein interacts with the Pax transcription factor Paired (Prd) and contains an F-box, a motif found in receptors for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. In normal development, Prd functions only in cells in which ppa mRNA expression has been repressed by another segmentation protein, Even-skipped (Eve). When ppa was expressed ectopically in these cells, Prd protein, but not mRNA, levels diminished. When ppa function was removed from cells that express prd mRNA, Prd protein levels increased. Conclusions: Ppa co-ordinates Prd degradation and is important for expression of Prd to be correctly localized. In the presence of Ppa, Prd protein is targeted for degradation at sites where its mis-expression would disrupt development. In the absence of Ppa, Prd is longer-lived and regulates downstream target genes...|$|R
40|$|Expression of the {{retroviral}} vector Neor myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV), which contains the v-mos oncogene and the neomycin resistance gene, leads to neoplastic transformation of mouse fibroblasts. Murine recombinant gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) could revert the neoplastic properties of established Neor MPSV-transformed cell lines to an apparently untransformed phenotype. In {{the presence of}} IFN-gamma, the Neor MPSV transformants showed a greater than 97 % reduction of cloning efficiency in soft agar, strongly reduced proliferative capacity, and morphological changes. The IFN-gamma-induced phenotypic reversion was preceded by a rapid and selective reduction of all retroviral RNA species, apparently due to IFN-gamma action on the long terminal repeat of Neor MPSV. The mRNA levels of cellular genes either remained unaffected (beta-actin) or were even enhanced (H- 2) in IFN-gamma-treated Neor MPSV-transformed cells. Upon removal of IFN-gamma, retroviral gene expression was fully recovered and a gradual reappearance of the transformed phenotype of these cells within 3 weeks was noted. These data show that IFN-gamma can cause a virtually complete, but reversible, inhibition of v-mos-induced neoplastic properties in transformed fibroblasts by <b>selective</b> down <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> retroviral RNA levels...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe second {{messenger}} cAMP has {{been implicated in}} the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> mammalian and amphibian oocyte maturation. Although a decrease in intraoocyte levels of cAMP precedes germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), the gonadotropin induction of ovulation and oocyte maturation is associated with major increases of cAMP in ovarian follicles. In the mammalian system, isolated oocytes undergo spontaneous maturationin vitrobut this process is blocked by treatment with a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, IBMX, which increases intraoocyte cAMP levels. In contrast, the same inhibitor, when added to cultured follicles for a brief time, increases follicle cAMP levels, followed by the induction of GVBD. To resolve the paradoxical actions of this PDE inhibitor on the maturation of isolated and follicle-enclosed oocytes, we hypothesized that meiotic maturation requires opposing fluctuations of cAMP levels in the somatic granulosa and germ cells. Such opposing fluctuations may result from <b>selective</b> expression and <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> PDEs in the somatic and germ cell compartments of the follicle. To test this hypothesis, PDE activity was manipulated in different follicular cells using type-specific inhibitors. The impact of the ensuing changes in cAMP levels in the two compartments was monitored by the induction of GVBD. In isolated oocytes, spontaneous GVBD was blocked by two inhibitors of type 3 PDE (cGMP-inhibited: CGI-PDE), milrinone and cilostamide. In contrast, treatment with an inhibitor for type 4 PDE (cAMP-specific), rolipram, was ineffective. These {{findings suggest that the}} oocyte expresses type 3 but not type 4 PDE and that increases in intraoocyte cAMP suppress GVBD. This hypothesis was confirmed byin situhybridization studies with PDE 3 and PDE 4 probes. PDE 3 B mRNA was concentrated in oocytes while PDE 4 D was mainly expressed in granulosa cells. In cultured follicles, LH treatment induced oocyte maturation but the gonadotropin action was blocked by inhibitors of type 3 but not the type 4 PDE inhibitors. Furthermore, treatment with the type 4, but not the type 3, PDE inhibitor mimics the action of LH and induces oocyte maturation, presumably by increasing cAMP levels in granulosa cells. Our findings indicate that PDE subtypes 4 and 3 are located in follicle somatic and germ cells, respectively. Preferential inhibition of PDE 3 in the oocyte may lead to a delay in oocyte maturation without affecting the cAMP-induced ovulatory process in the somatic cells. Conversely, selective suppression of granulosa cell cAMP–PDE may enhance the gonadotropin induction of ovulation and oocyte maturation. Thus, in addition to the well-recognized differential expression and <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> adenylate cyclase in the somatic and germ cell compartments of the follicle, we suggest that <b>selective</b> <b>regulation</b> and expression <b>of</b> PDEs may be involved in the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> cAMP levels and control of oocyte maturation in the preovulatory mammalian follicle...|$|R

However, neither the cell {{biological}} effects nor signal transduction mechanisms of the reverse signal are well understood. We describe a cytoplasmic protein, PDZ-RGS 3, which binds B ephrins through a PDZ domain, {{and has a}} regulator of heterotrimeric G protein signaling (RGS) domain. PDZ-RGS 3 can mediate signaling from the ephrin-B cytoplasmic tail. SDF- 1, a chemokine with a G protein–coupled receptor, or BDNF, act as chemoattractants for cerebellar granule cells, with SDF- 1 action being selectively inhibited by soluble EphB receptor.

40|$|SummaryUnderstanding the {{mechanism}} underlying {{the regulation of}} the androgen receptor (AR), a central player {{in the development of}} castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), holds promise for overcoming the challenge of treating CRPC. We demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase Siah 2 targets a select pool of NCOR 1 -bound, transcriptionally-inactive AR for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, thereby promoting expression of select AR target genes implicated in lipid metabolism, cell motility, and proliferation. Siah 2 is required for prostate cancer cell growth under androgen-deprivation conditions in vitro and in vivo, and Siah 2 inhibition promotes prostate cancer regression upon castration. Notably, Siah 2 expression is markedly increased in human CRPCs.

40|$|To {{test the}} novel {{hypothesis}} that the K+ efflux mediated by NMDA receptors might be regulated differently than the influx of Ca 2 + and Na+ through the same receptor channels, NMDA receptor whole-cell currents carried concurrently or individually by Ca 2 +, Na+ and K+ were analysed in cultured mouse cortical neurons. In contrast to the NMDA inward current carried by Ca 2 + and Na+, the NMDA receptor outward K+ current or NMDA-K current, recorded either in {{the presence or absence}} of extracellular Ca 2 + and Na+, and at different or the same membrane potentials, showed much less sensitivity to alterations in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration and underwent little rundown. In line with a <b>selective</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> the NMDA receptor K+ permeability, the ratio of the NMDA inward/outward currents decreased, and the reversal potential of composite NMDA currents recorded in physiological solutions shifted by − 8. 5 mV after repeated activation of NMDA receptors. Moreover, a depolarizing pre-pulse of a few seconds or a burst of brief depolarizing pulses selectively augmented the subsequent NMDA-K current, but not the NMDA inward current. On the other hand, a hyperpolarizing pre-pulse showed the opposite effect of reducing the NMDA-K current. The voltage- and activity-dependent regulation of the NMDA-K current did not require the existence of extracellular Ca 2 + or Ca 2 + influx; it was, however, affected by the duration of the pre-pulse and was subject to a time-dependent decay. The burst of excitatory activity revealed a lasting upregulation of the NMDA-K current even 5 s after termination of the pre-pulses. Our data reveal a <b>selective</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> the NMDA receptor K+ permeability and represent a novel model of voltage- and excitatory activity-dependent plasticity at the receptor level...|$|E
40|$|Summary Objective: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the experimental synergists muscle ablation model to promote muscle hypertrophy, determine the period of greatest hypertrophy and its influence on muscle fiber types and determine differences in bilateral and unilateral removal to reduce the number of animals used in this model. Method: Following the application of the eligibility criteria for the mechanical overload of the plantar muscle in rats, nineteen papers were included in the review. Results: The results reveal a greatest hypertrophy occurring between days 12 and 15, and based on the findings, synergist muscle ablation is an efficient model for achieving rapid hypertrophy and the contralateral limb can be used as there was no difference between unilateral and bilateral surgery, which reduces the number of animals used in this model. Conclusion: This model differs from other overload models (exercise and training) regarding the characteristics involved in the hypertrophy process (acute) and result in a chronic muscle adaptation with <b>selective</b> <b>regulation</b> and modification <b>of</b> fast-twitch fibers in skeletal muscle.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} subcellular localization of neurotrophins and their receptors are poorly understood. We {{show that in}} cultured hippocampal neurons, the mRNAs for BDNF and TrkB have a somatodendritic localization, and we quantify {{the extent of their}} dendritic mRNA localization. In the dendrites the labeling covers on average the proximal 30 % of the total dendritic length. On high potassium depolarization, the labeling of BDNF and TrkB mRNA extends on average to 68 % of the dendritic length. This increase does not depend on new RNA synthesis, is inhibited by the Na � channel blocker tetrodotoxin, and involves the activation of glutamate receptors. Extracellular Ca 2 �, partly flowing through L-type Ca 2 � channels, is absolutely required for this process to occur. At the protein level, a brief stimulation of hippocampal neurons with 10 mM KCl leads to a marked increase of BDNF and TrkB immunofluorescence density in the distal portion of dendrites, which also occurs, even if at lower levels, when transport is inhibited by nocodazole. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide abolishes this increase. The activity-dependent modulation of mRNA targeting and protein accumulation in the dendrites may provide a mechanism for achieving a <b>selective</b> local <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> the activity of neurotrophins and their receptors, close to their sites of action...|$|R

Approximately 60 % of the APRA-defined mRNAs directly associate with FMRP.

Only GluR 1 associated with the b 2 AR is phosphorylated by PKA on b 2 AR stimulation. Peptides that interfere with the b 2 AR– GluR 1 association prevent this phosphorylation of GluR 1.

In the course of atherosclerosis, deletion of Wip 1 results in suppression of macrophage conversion into foam cells, thus preventing the formation of atherosclerotic plaques.

40|$|Viral {{interference}} with secretory cargo {{is a common}} mechanism for pathogen immune evasion. <b>Selective</b> down <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> critical immune system molecules such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins enables pathogens to mask themselves from their host. African swine fever virus (ASFV) disrupts the trans-Golgi network (TGN) by altering the localization of TGN 46, an organelle marker for the distal secretory pathway. Reorganization of membrane transport components may provide a mechanism whereby ASFV can disrupt the correct secretion and/or cell surface expression of host proteins. In the study reported here, we used the tsO 45 temperature-sensitive mutant of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus to show that ASFV significantly reduces {{the rate at which}} the protein is delivered to the plasma membrane. This is linked to a general reorganization of the secretory pathway during infection and a specific, microtubule-dependent disruption of structural components of the TGN. Golgin p 230 and TGN 46 are separated into distinct vesicles, whereupon TGN 46 is depleted. These data suggest that disruption of the TGN by ASFV can slow membrane traffic during viral infection. This may be functionally important because infection of macrophages with virulent isolates of ASFV increased the expression of MHC class I genes, but there was no parallel increase in MHC class I molecule delivery to the plasma membrane...|$|R

Promoter usage in the carcinomas and B-cells appears, in some cases at least, to be cell-type specific. Expression may also be governed by methylation since a chromosomally silent region in the carcinoma (that encompassing TP 1) is highly methylated on CpG residues, whereas the active region (encoding TP 2 and LMP) is virtually free of such methylation. Our data suggest that there may be <b>selective</b> transcriptional <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> EBV genes in the two types of cells investigated.

40|$|Energy {{metabolism}} and, specifically, {{the coupling}} of mitochondria to {{growth and survival}} {{is controlled by the}} cAMP-PKA pathway in yeast. In higher eukaryotes, cAMP signaling originating at the plasma membrane is distributed to different subcellular districts by cAMP waves received by PKA bound to PKA anchor proteins (AKAPs) tethered to these compartments. This review focuses on the subgroup of AKAPs that anchor PKA to the mitochondrial outer membrane (mtAKAPs).

We show while both avirulent (H 37 Ra) and virulent (H 37 Rv) mycobacteria could readily localize to autophagosomes, their maturation into autolysosomes (flux) was significantly inhibited {{by the latter}} strain. The inhibition of autophagy flux by the virulent strain was highly selective, as it did not perturb the basal autophagy flux in the macrophages. Selective inhibition of flux of Mtb-containing autophagosomes required virulence regulators PhoP and ESAT- 6. We show that the maturation of Mtb-containing autophagosomes into autolysosomes required recruitment of the late endosome marker RAB 7, forming the intermediate compartment amphisomes. Virulent Mtb selectively evaded their targeting to the amphisomes.

In this study, for the first time, a general gene expression profile for lace plant leaf development was investigated. Methodology. A cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism involving 64 primer combinations was used for a half-genome analysis of 4666 transcripts. Two hundred and thirty differentially expressed transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were sequenced. A partial expressed sequence tag (EST) database for window-stage (in which PCD is occurring) leaves was also established. Through a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, the possible role of ubiquitin in lace plant PCD was investigated. Pivotal results. Seventy-nine TDFs were successfully annotated. The isolated TDFs and ESTs encoded genes involved in processes such as photosynthesis, biosynthesis pathways, gene regulation, stress responses, defense against pathogens, and PCD, among others.

40|$|The rat {{pheochromocytoma}} PC 12 cell line, which differentiates into sympathetic neurons under nerve {{growth factor}} (NGF) treatment, contains {{at least three}} phosphoinositidase C (PIC) isozymes, PIC beta, PIC gamma, PIC delta. These isozymes have been previously shown to display a different subcellular localization. To {{determine whether or not}} NGF induces changes in the presence and/or distribution of PIC isozymes during PC 12 neural differentiation, studies were carried out by means of in situ immunocytochemistry. After NGF administration the proliferative activity was progressively reduced to very low levels, as measured by bromodeoxy Uridine incorporation, and a neuron-like morphology was displayed by almost all cells. In unstimulated PC 12 cells, PIC beta was detected in the nucleus whereas PIC delta was only cytoplasmic; PIC gamma was found in both cell compartments. In cells treated with NGF for 3 days, neural processes extended to twice the diameter of the cell body; the gamma isoform was concentrated near the nucleus, while the immunoreactivity of the beta form remained constant and the delta form was increased. After 10 days of treatment with NGF, PIC beta was hardly detectable and PIC gamma immunostaining was considerably decreased. On the contrary, PIC delta progressively increased and, after 14 days of NGF exposure, fully differentiated cells displayed an intense labelling of cell body and neurites. In the same cells, PIC beta and PIC gamma were almost negative. These results suggest that NGF dependent neural differentiation is related to the <b>selective</b> down <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> PIC beta and gamma and the increase of PIC delta isozyme associated with the decrease of cell proliferation...|$|R
40|$|Histone-modifying enzymes play {{essential}} {{roles in}} physiological and aberrant gene regulation. Since histone deacetylases (HDACs) are promising targets of cancer therapy, {{it is important}} to understand the mechanisms <b>of</b> HDAC <b>regulation.</b> <b>Selective</b> modulators <b>of</b> HDAC isoenzymes could serve as efficient and well-tolerated drugs. We show that HDAC 2 undergoes basal turnover by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Valproic acid (VPA), in addition to selectively inhibiting the catalytic activity of class I HDACs, induces proteasomal degradation of HDAC 2, in contrast to other inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA). Basal and VPA-induced HDAC 2 turnover critically depend on the E 2 ubiquitin conjugase Ubc 8 and the E 3 ubiquitin ligase RLIM. Ubc 8 gene expression is induced by both VPA and TSA, whereas only TSA simultaneously reduces RLIM protein levels and therefore fails to induce HDAC 2 degradation. Thus, poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation provide an isoenzyme-selective mechanism for downregulation of HDAC 2...|$|R
