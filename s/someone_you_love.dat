500|$|In 2009, Aronofsky {{reflected}} on the reception of The Fountain, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} Fountain-haters out [...] The film's about the fact that it's OK that we die, and we should come to terms with it. But many, many people don't want to think about that, so why pay money for a meditation on losing <b>someone</b> <b>you</b> <b>love?</b> Everything about western culture denies that." [...] He also believed the film was released at the wrong time, [...] "It was pre-Obama, {{smack in the middle of}} Paris Hilton time. But there has been a serious turn now, people are starting to realise that the party's over, finally. So we can stop thinking about the culture of superficiality, start to remember there are other things going on." ...|$|E

In the video, Gaga walks from New York City to Nebraska to get her boyfriend back. According to Gaga: [...] "I'm walking with no luggage and no nothing and it's just me and my ankles are bleeding {{a little bit and}} there's grass stuck in my shoes and I've got this outfit on and it's real sort of New York clothing and I'm sprinting... And the [...] idea that when you're away from <b>someone</b> <b>you</b> <b>love,</b> it's torture," [...] she continued. [...] "I knew I wanted the video to be about me sprinting back and walking hundreds of thousands of miles to get him back." ...|$|E

It was written by Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds, Antonio Dixon and Patrick [...] "J. Que" [...] Smith and produced by the first two. The song was released by Republic Records on July 22, 2013, as the second single from the album. The song was initially written with the singer Beyoncé in mind, but she rejected it. [...] "Baby I" [...] is an R and pop song with drums, horns and a syncopated beat. It also contains an uptempo '90s-inspired beat. Lyrically, the song is {{about not being able}} to fully express your feelings towards <b>someone</b> <b>you</b> <b>love.</b> The song was well received by music critics who complimented the song's [...] "throwback" [...] sound while others praised Grande's vocals comparing to the singer Mariah Carey.|$|E

He said that the episode was about love, and the choices that result from that, {{and that it was}} an extraordinary story about losing <b>someone</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> and having that person restored to you some time afterward. Following the death of Jadzia in the [...] finale, [...] "Tears of the Prophets", Farrell suggested that the symbiont could be moved to a male character resulting in a similar situation as [...] "Rejoined" [...] between the new Dax host and Worf, as the two were in a relationship at that point. Instead, the symbiont was placed in a new female host called Ezri, as the producers did not want Kira Nerys to be the only female main character.

2500|$|I {{could have}} done lots more, put in much more work and {{developed}} more pictures, but I had also a desire to say what I felt about life.

[...] I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with <b>someone</b> <b>you</b> <b>love,</b> seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E
2500|$|The head of story, Don Hall, {{described}} the plot as {{a fairy tale}} [...] "twisted enough that it seems new and fresh", with a kingdom that is a modern city, a handsome prince that is a [...] "knuckleheaded playboy" [...] and {{a variation on the}} fairy godmother with Mama Odie. Co-writer Rob Edwards also said The Princess and the Frog was [...] "a princess movie for people who don't like princess movies". As the writers thought Tiana's character motivation of simply dreaming of having her own restaurant was not appealing enough, they expanded so it was her father's as well, with the extra philosophy of [...] "food bringing people together from all walks of life". Musker and Clements stated that while Tiana already starts as a sympathetic character, the events of the plot make her [...] "understand things in a deeper level" [...] and change people around her. Both protagonists would learn from each other— Naveen to take responsibilities, Tiana to enjoy life— as well as figuring from Ray's passion for Evangeline that the perfect balance is brought by having <b>someone</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> to share the experience. Tiana became the first African-American Disney Princess.|$|E
