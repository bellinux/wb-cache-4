5|$|A {{second case}} occurs {{a few days}} later, another man killed by the beetles, but they find the beetles to be larger and more mature. From the second victim's movements, they {{identify}} the likely culprit as Dr. Armand Silva (Alon Abutbul), a former scientist. Dr. Silva {{was working on a}} cure for avian flu using the skelter beetle, but his research was terminated with the extinction of the sheep. Fauxlivia and Frank postulate Dr. Silva may be trying to breed the beetles in humans, who share <b>similar</b> <b>biological</b> features with sheep.|$|E
5|$|Blandy ordered Warren {{to explain}} his {{position}} to 1,400 skeptical officers and sailors. Some found him persuasive, but it was August 9 before he convinced Blandy. That was the date when Blandy realized, for the first time, that Geiger counters could not detect plutonium. Blandy {{was aware of the}} health problems of radium dial painters who ingested microscopic amounts of radium in the 1920s, and the fact that plutonium was assumed to have a <b>similar</b> <b>biological</b> effect. When plutonium was discovered in the captain's quarters of Prinz Eugen, unaccompanied by fission products, Blandy realized that plutonium could be anywhere.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{two species}} Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica have {{extremely}} <b>similar</b> <b>biological</b> features, and {{are known to be}} almost indistinguishable, they in fact have several differences regarding their nest characteristics. Vespula germanica nests generally survive the winter, while those of Vespula vulgaris do not. The reason for this difference mostly comes from the variation in prey each species feeds on. Vespula vulgaris food sources are greatly affected by the temperature while that of Vespula germanica are not, providing them with a much higher chance of survival even during the winter. Because many Vespula germanica are able to overwinter and most Vespula vulgaris do not, except for the queen, this affects the nest size of {{the two species}}. Vespula germanica generally have slightly bigger nest size (3500–9000 larvae in one colony cycle) than Vespula vulgaris (3000–8000 larvae in one colony cycle).|$|E

2500|$|Gender {{identity}} and roles {{play an important}} part in Mormon theology which teaches a strict binary of spiritual gender as literal offspring of divine parents. Part of Sunday Church meetings are currently divided by biological sex, and for most of the 1800s church presidents Joseph Smith and Brigham Young had men, women, and children set separately for all Sunday meetings. Expressions and identities for sexuality and gender are [...] "separate, but related" [...] aspects of a person and stem from <b>similar</b> <b>biological</b> origins. As far as gender minorities, Church leaders have stated that they have unfinished business in teaching on the difficult and sensitive topic of transgender individuals. Church spokesman Eric Hawkins stated in March 2016 that LDS bishops recognize that [...] "each case is different" [...] and [...] "difficult and sensitive" [...] and that they recognize the [...] "emotional pain" [...] many gender minorities feel. He also reaffirmed the church's views that [...] "gender is part of our eternal God-given {{identity and}} purpose" [...] and stated that the Church does not baptize [...] "those who are planning trans-sexual operations" [...] and that undergoing a [...] "trans-sexual operation" [...] may imperil the membership of a church member.|$|E
