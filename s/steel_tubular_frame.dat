5000|$|The Big Ruckus PS250 is a 250cc, CVT transmission-equipped {{two-seater}} scooter, {{manufactured by}} Honda; marketed in Japan for model years 2004-2007 and in North America for model years 2005-2006 [...] - [...] and {{noted for its}} minimal bodywork and expressed light-weight <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>frame,</b> akin to the Honda Zoomer.|$|E
50|$|The {{machine was}} {{constructed}} on a custom-made <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> using spare parts and equipment from automobiles, farm machinery and elsewhere. Fitted with a de Havilland Gipsy aero engine, it had twin concentric contra-rotating rotors {{of stainless steel}} tubing with fabric covering and with full cyclic and collective pitch control.|$|E

40|$|Design of new {{evolution}} <b>steel</b> welded <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> specified for Formula Student {{series is}} the main goal of this thesis. In the first instance, type of frame designs is described. Next part of thesis is devote to rules, which must be respected in designing of new evolution of <b>tubular</b> <b>frame.</b> In main part, construction design and calculations of torsional stiffness using MKP analysis are mentioned. Interesting point of this work is located at penultimate part, which deals with preparation of <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> production. This is {{integral part of the}} construction process at all. Thesis ends with project summary...|$|R
50|$|It is a {{stressed}} skin construction, {{in which the}} flat aluminium body panels, and especially the floor, triangulate the largely rectangular <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> structure. This gives a rigid frame with few tubes and very little body weight that does {{not contribute to the}} frame stiffness. The flat panels avoid difficulties in shaping aluminum sheet into smooth compound curves. On the down side, it does not allow attractive curves or streamlining.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the {{successful}} Tuscan Challenge race series was {{in need of}} updating and Peter Wheeler began the project that would fulfil his ambition to see TVRs at Le Mans. Work began on a completely new racing car that would be built using modern composites, be more rigid than any previous TVR and be CAD designed to reach speeds in excess of 200MPH and be stable. The car itself would be a <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> with full roll cage forming the backbone to a full carbon fibre monocoque.|$|E
50|$|To {{minimize}} weight, {{the aircraft}} {{was to have}} a <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> with aluminum skin and plywood wings. The inline-8 engine, designed by Harry Miller of Indy 500 racing fame, was to sit behind the pilot in a configuration similar to the P-39 Airacobra. The USAAC ordered a single XP-57 prototype. However, when design was delayed due to financial problems in the company, the contract was allowed to lapse. No production aircraft was ever built because the USAAC was moving towards larger fighters and had lost interest in the project.|$|E
50|$|Though {{similar in}} name, the Ducati 98 TS (aka 98 Bronco) was {{different}} than the earlier 98 range, having a milder-tuned engine (7:1 compression) and a new duplex full-cradle <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Ducati GT1000 used {{a similar}} <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> trellis <b>frame</b> to the Paul Smart and the Sport1000, {{and the same}} Desmodue [...] engine. It was {{designed}} with comfort in mind and intended for sport-touring riders. The frame differed from the Sport1000 in the addition of mounting points for twin shocks and side panels. The GT1000 had touring handlebars, mounted on the same front forks as the Sport has clip-ons: non-adjustable 43 mm Marzocchi upside-down forks.|$|R

5000|$|Lacking {{sufficient}} {{capital to}} develop a new model, Hudson reached an agreement for a prototype to be built in Milan by Carrozzeria Touring. A complete Hudson Jet was shipped to Italy. A new body design, based on sketches by Frank Spring, was formed over a <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>frame.</b> This unibody system of aluminum panels was known as superleggera (equivalent to “very lightweight” in Italian), and [...] "was expensive and fairly revolutionary in its day." [...] The work done by Carrozzeria Touring was under the supervision of Spring and Hudson's vice-president, Stuart Baits. The Italia (coupes and one four-door prototype) was the only project that Carrozzeria Touring undertook for a U.S. automaker.|$|E
50|$|The superleggera {{system is}} no longer used in {{high-volume}} automobile production {{for a number of}} reasons. Primarily, a superleggera body cannot meet modern impact resistance standards, and the cost of manufacture and galvanic corrosion between the aluminum body panels and the <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> are also prohibitive factors. Additionally, the frame tubes used to construct a superleggera body are too small and of unsuitable material for mounting suspension components, so a chassis is required, a disadvantage not found in spaceframe and other chassis systems. Car makers such as Bristol, which had aircraft industry experience, were more successful in countering galvanic corrosion than other manufacturers. Bristol introduced Superleggera construction on the Bristol 401 of 1948.|$|E
5000|$|Designated as the Ascort-TSV-1300 G.T., it {{utilized}} a mildly modified Volkswagen chassis {{fitted with}} a four-seat coupé body {{which was based on}} that of the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia coupé, although significantly different in appearance. The body, which was constructed of fibreglass, had a prestressed double shell with a bonded-in light <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>frame,</b> and was mounted on an 11-inch rubber seal. The 1.3-litre Volkswagen flat-4 engine was modified using Okrasa and Porsche components to produce 54 bhp at 4300 rpm. The vehicle's total weight was 1467 lb, 33% less than that of a standard Volkswagen Beetle sedan. The Ascort had a top speed of 96 mph [...] and could accelerate from zero to 50 mph in 12.0 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The cars {{must have}} a chassis (monocoque or <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> <b>frame)</b> {{manufactured}} domestically, Nissan GA15S/GA15DS engine and a 4-speed transmission (reverse gear optional). The displacement of the carbureted engines may be increased up to 1600cc.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} is {{a concrete}} slab {{on the ground}} measuring 5.2 metres by 2.5 metres with a sloping pond floor. In-situ poured concrete base walls have <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> <b>framing</b> with wire mesh located on {{the upper half of}} the north wall.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame is}} a split-backbone <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> <b>frame.</b> Front forks are Sachs 46 mm {{upside-down}} telescopic forks while the rear is a dual swing arm made of pentagonal steel tubing {{with a single}} rear shock and progressive linkage, also supplied by Sachs.|$|R
5000|$|The Silk 700S was {{launched}} in 1975 and featured a new engine based on the two stroke engine from the Scott Flying Squirrel in a specially designed <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> made by Spondon of Derbyshire, who also made the forks. [...] At a cost of £1355 it was more expensive than most other production motorcycles of the time. Right from the start the Silk 700S featured {{state of the art}} electronic ignition and had a power-to-weight ratio combined with excellent handling that enabled it to compete with some of the best road bikes of the time. Top speed was an impressive 110 mph. The bike did not have an electric start; the kick-starting technique took some practice.|$|E
50|$|The Silk 700S was {{launched}} in 1975 and featured the new engine in a <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> made by Spondon Engineering of Derbyshire, who also made the forks, yokes, disc/drum brakes and rotors. Priced at £1,355 {{it was the most}} expensive production motorcycle of the time. The 700S continued to be developed at the Darley Abbey works in Derbyshire, along with the SPR Production Racing version. Production was slow, with just two motorcycles a week coming off the production line. Customers could select from five colour schemes - British Racing Green, metallic blue or green, black with gold coachlines or plain red. There was also a Scott special edition in purple and cream - and a special scheme similar to Silk Cut cigarettes, which were popular at the time.|$|E
50|$|There {{is often}} {{confusion}} over {{the naming of}} this project. While the project itself was focussed and singular, its naming was more typical of TVR. The car itself would be a <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> with full roll cage forming the backbone to a full carbon fibre monocoque. While larger than any previous road TVR, it would be lighter, stiffer and much stronger. New suspension designs were implemented and professional CAD design and aero testing ensured a shape that would be stable at 200MPH+. It began life as the TuscanR (TVR T400R) (following the Tuscan racers (TVR Tuscan Challenge) that the cars were to replace). This was a two-seater, composite race/road car. There was one road car prototype built in 2001 which was displayed during its lifetime (it was cut up and destroyed) in two colours, purple and silver. The rear lights of this car differ from those that followed. The early TVR T400R racers had this design.|$|E
50|$|The DDR is {{a sports}} car {{manufactured}} by DDR Motorsport Miami Inc. in Miami, Florida, United States. The design is mid engined, rear wheel drive layout, with a <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> space <b>frame</b> chassis and composite body.|$|R
50|$|The VF500F {{utilized}} {{a skeleton}} square <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> with conventional forks and a rear mono-spring/damper suspension using a cast aluminum swingarm. It used a 16-inch front wheel with a 100/90-16 tire for reduced rotational inertia to make steering easier. The rear wheel is 18-inch with a 110/90-18 tire.|$|R
5000|$|The car had dual circuit, servo-assisted disc brakes, {{and most}} cars were {{supplied}} with a 3-speed automatic B & W gearbox. The exterior body panels were constructed from aluminium alloy over a Superleggera <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> <b>frame.</b> The interior was upholstered in leather {{and had a}} burled walnut dashboard.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the model}} {{experiment}} on seismic behavior of a 1 -span, 2 -story concrete-filled rectangular steel tubal（CFRST）frame under lateral cyclic loads, a 3 -D nonlinear finite element model of concrete-filled rectangular <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> is proposed in the paper. Compared with the experimental hysteresis curve, the computational results {{are found to be}} accurate, which shows that this model proposed in the paper can be applied in structure analysis of concrete-filled rectangular tubular frames. So the model was used in the finite element analysis of concrete-filled rectangular frame with different axial load level. Compared the computational displacement envelop curves, it concludes that the ductility and bearing capacity of CFRST frames reduces with the increasing axial load level...|$|E
5000|$|Later streetfighters used {{custom-built}} frames {{intended to}} overcome {{the weakness of the}} <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> of the early 4-cylinder superbikes of the 1970s and 1980s. Many of these frames turned out to be [...] "beautifully crafted pieces of metallurgical art," [...] perhaps only unintentionally. Many were also originally racing machines.|$|R
5000|$|Some 20,133 {{of these}} 600 cc shaft-drive, opposed twin R60 (1956-1960, [...] ), R60/2 (1960-1969, [...] ), and R60US (1968-1969, 30 hp) were built. These models, {{except for those}} with the [...] "US" [...] designation, were {{designed}} primarily as rugged motorcycles to pull sidecars (mounting points were built in) and had duplex <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 2008 model had new {{bodywork}} and {{a lightweight}} cast aluminum frame {{instead of the}} original <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> <b>frame.</b> The 2nd generation 41 mm diameter fork tubes were further enlarged to 43 mm, and front wheel size grew to 15 inch instead of 14 inch. Fuel tank capacity increased from 14 to 15 L.|$|R
5000|$|The upper {{third of}} the tower {{features}} an inverted parabolic arch. [...] The building utilises butt jointed glazing combined {{with the lack of}} both distinguished floor lines and other tall buildings around it. [...] The lower two thirds were constructed with a reinforced concrete frame while the top third has a <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Yokosuka MXY-5 was a Japanese {{military}} glider {{produced for}} the Imperial Japanese Navy during the World War II. The glider consisted of fabric-wrapped plywood covering a <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> <b>frame.</b> The design also featured a retractable undercarriage {{as well as}} an emergency skid. The design was flight tested in 1942. Only 12 were produced and none were used operationally.|$|R
