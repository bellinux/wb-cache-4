These reports are a summary of the water supplies sources and water quality testing results. The reports must be sent to all customers annually. Subpart Q regulates how violations must be reported.|$|E
5000|$|A Technical Standard Order (TSO) is {{a minimum}} {{performance}} standard {{issued by the}} United States Federal Aviation Administration for specified materials, parts, processes, and appliances used on civil aircraft. Articles with TSO design approval are eligible for use on the United States type certified products. The TSO authorization or a letter of TSO Design Approval does not necessarily convey approval for installation. See 14 CFR Part 21 <b>Subpart</b> <b>O.</b>|$|E
50|$|The FAA applies DO-178B as the {{document}} it uses for guidance {{to determine if}} the software will perform reliably in an airborne environment, when specified by the Technical Standard Order (TSO) for which certification is sought. In the United States, the introduction of TSOs into the airworthiness certification process, and by extension DO-178B, is explicitly established in Title 14: Aeronautics and Space of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), also known as the Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 21, <b>Subpart</b> <b>O.</b>|$|E
40|$|To address {{increased}} risk of a maximum allowable operating pressure based on higher stress levels in the following areas: Take the following additional step: (10) Conducting periodic assessments of integrity. (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d) (9) (iii) of this section, for an existing segment, do a baseline internal assessment using a geometry tool and a high resolution magnetic flux tool before, but within two years prior to, raising pressure as allowed under this section. (iii) If headers, mainline valve by-passes, compressor station piping, meter station piping, or other short portion of a segment cannot accommodate a geometry tool and a high resolution magnetic flux tool, use direct assessment to assess that portion. (i) Determine a frequency for subsequent periodic inspections as if the segments were covered by <b>subpart</b> <b>O</b> of this part. (ii) Conduct periodic internal inspections using a high resolution magnetic flux tool on the frequency determined under paragraph (d) (10) (i) of this section...|$|E
40|$|Workers in highway work {{zones are}} exposed to risk of injury from the {{movement}} of construction vehicles and equipment within the work zones, {{as well as from}} passing motor vehicle traffic. Data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) indicate that of the 841 work-related fatalities in the U. S. highway construction industry between 1992 and 1998, 465 (55 %) were vehicle- or equipment-related incidents that occurred in a work zone. Highway workers routinely work in proximity to construction vehicles and motor vehicle traffic. Flaggers and other workers on foot {{are exposed to}} the risk of being struck by traffic vehicles or construction equipment if they are not visible to motorists or equipment operators. Workers who operate construction vehicles or equipment risk injury due to overturn, collision, or being caught in running equipment. Highway workers, regardless of their assigned task, work in conditions of low lighting, low visibility, and inclement weather, and may work in congested areas with exposure to high traffic volume and speeds. The Federal Highway Administration has developed and maintained the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which provides for uniform design and setup of highway work zones. The primary focus of Part 6 of the MUTCD is the interaction between the road user and the work zone. The MUTCD contains exhaustive specifications for signage, pavement and curb markings, traffic signals, and marking of school zones, bicycle facilities, and highway-rail crossings. It also prescribes temporary traffic control measures for numerous scenarios involving lane closures, lane shifts, detours, shoulder work, median crossovers, mobile operations, and blasting. The MUTCD addresses topics such as training, personal protective equipment, speed reduction, barriers, and lighting, as they apply to highway construction. OSHA construction industry regulations (29 CFR 1926, <b>Subpart</b> <b>O)</b> address operation of vehicles and equipment within an off-highway job site not open to public traffic. However, <b>Subpart</b> <b>O</b> is not exhaustive in its coverage of machinery types or safety equipment, nor does it address work practices, traffic control plans, or shift work. Flagging and signaling practices are discussed in general terms in Subpart G, which covers signs, signals, and barricades. Subpart G defers to the 1971 MUTCD on matters relating to hand signals, barricades, and traffic control devices. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Also available via the World Wide Web.

40|$|New {{materials}} have {{allowed for a}} reduced size and weight of compressed gas cylinders that store pure oxygen at high pressures, giving manufacturers of closed-circuit self-contained self-rescuers (SCSRs) improved options for meeting the new standard for oxygen consumption requirements set forth in 42 CFR Part 84 <b>Subpart</b> <b>O.</b> These newly designed very high-pressure cylinders - currently Department of Transportation (DOT) -certified for oxygen duty to 3, 000 psi and now available in two sizes - will enable manufacturers to reduce the overall size and weight of future SCSR units by incorporating these cylinders in their designs. Using this new cylinder technology at 3, 000 psi represents a significant advancement, affording greater SCSR design flexibility by allowing manufacturers to choose between cylinders with two length dimensions, using them singularly or in combination, which will enable different capacities and therefore different operational durations for SCSR designs. Moreover, the new cylinder technology {{was designed to be}} capable of meeting DOT certification for 5, 000 psi oxygen duty. Therefore, SCSR manufacturers can pursue DOT certification for use at 5, 000 psi to further reduce the size and weight of their devices beyond what is already achievable at 3, 000 psi.
