50|$|The weeping tile {{is to be}} {{installed}} so that {{the top of the}} product is lower than the bottom of the interior concrete floor. The weeping tile should be connected to a <b>sump</b> <b>pit,</b> located on the interior of the home. The ground water collected in the <b>sump</b> <b>pit</b> can then be removed by a sump pump. The exhausted water can be pumped a safe distance from the home by means of a flexible line or in some areas, into the city storm drains. Care should be taken not to create flooding conditions for adjoining properties.|$|E

50|$|Alternative {{sump pump}} {{systems can be}} driven by {{municipal}} water pressure. Water-powered sump pumps are similar to backup-battery-driven systems with a separate pump, float and check valves. During installation, the float is mounted in the <b>sump</b> <b>pit</b> above the normal high water mark. Under normal conditions, your main electric powered sump pump will handle all the pumping duties. When water rises higher than normal for any reason, the backup float in the sump is lifted and activates the backup sump pump. As municipal water rushes through the ejector, it creates a powerful suction force which causes the PVC pipe {{to act like a}} giant soda straw, drawing water up from the sump and ejecting it outdoors. There are no impellers, turbines, motors, or mechanical parts to wear out. There are no batteries, wires, or chargers to monitor, tend to, or replace.|$|E
40|$|Constructed in 1974, {{the present}} {{saltwater}} {{system of the}} SEAFDEC/AQD Tigbauan Research Station (TRS) consists of five pumps, two <b>sump</b> <b>pits,</b> a buffer, sedimentation and filtration treatment system (BSF), an intake pipe, and a distribution system. Two pumps operate at a time, one to bring in water from the sea to the BSF {{and the other to}} pump filtered water to distribution lines. Backwashing is provided. The pumps are operated 24 hours a day. Distribution lines are made of PVC pipes which are buried to protect them from direct sunlight. For even pressure, closed loop pipe connection is employed. Preventive maintenance undertaken to ensure continuous operation includes the intake pipe, <b>sump</b> <b>pits,</b> BSF, pumps and distribution lines. Construction of a similar system is expensive and maintenance cost is high. An intake structure patterned after the Underground Dr Concept is proposed as an alternative...|$|R
50|$|Large {{systems with}} {{numerous}} collection chambers {{benefit from the}} provision of a monitoring system for remote monitoring of the vacuum valves and <b>sump</b> <b>pits.</b> Such systems allow much faster trouble shooting and easier preventive maintenance of collection chambers and valves. However, monitoring systems are optional systems and not required for operation of vacuum sewer systems.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum {{trucks are}} used in the {{petroleum}} industry, for cleaning of storage tanks and spills. They are also an important part of drilling oil and natural gas wells, as they are located at the drilling site. Vacuum trucks are used to remove drilling mud, drilling cuttings, cement, spills, and for removal of brine water from production tanks. They dispose of this in <b>sump</b> <b>pits,</b> treatment plants or if within safe levels may be spread out in a farmer's field.|$|R

40|$|The Kansas Radon Program {{assisted}} {{the city of}} Manhattan with conducting a survey of homes built with radon-resistant new construction (RRNC) techniques. The project {{was part of an}} EPA initiative to build a database of RRNC homes across the country. Twenty-four homes were initially tested with 13 homes (54 %) exhibiting elevated radon levels (average radon value of 4. 0 pCi 1 L or higher). Seven homes were then tested using the EPA RRNC efficiency testing protocol. The average observed reduction in radon was approximately 3 1 %. Multiple construction errors were noted during physical examination of the homes including 1) either uncovered or unsealed <b>sump</b> <b>pit</b> foundation penetrations, 2) excessive horizontal pipe runs, 3) failure to run the vent pipe through the roof, and 4) placement of the vent pipe in non-conditioned spaces such as garages...|$|E
40|$|The Kansas Radon Program {{performed}} a follow-up round of efficiency testing of homes built with Radon Resistant New Construction (RRNC) techniques in Manhattan, Kansas. The project {{was designed to}} review performance and identify whether defects identified during the November 2002 -January 2003 testing program (performed {{in conjunction with the}} National Environmental Health Association (NEHA), the EPA and the City of Manhattan), were being reduced or eliminated. Eleven homes volunteered to undergo efficiency testing as per the EPA RRNC efficiency testing protocol. Of the 11 homes, 4 homes (36 %) exhibited elevated radon levels (average radon value of 4. 0 pCi/L or higher) during the operational phase of the testing. The average observed percent reduction in the RRNC systems was 36. 6 %. Construction errors similar to those identified during the November 2002 testing period were found, including: 1) unsealed <b>sump</b> <b>pit</b> foundation penetrations, 2) excessive horizontal pipe runs, and 3) inadequate attic bracing on horizontal pipe runs...|$|E
40|$|Radon is a colorless, odorless, {{radioactive}} gas {{emitted from}} uranium, a naturally occurring mineral in rocks and soil. Normally, radon rises {{up through the}} soil and then dissipates in the air outside. Radon becomes a concern, however, when it seeps in through openings such as cracks, loose-fitting pipes, <b>sump</b> <b>pits,</b> dirt floors, slab joints, or block walls and accumulates in the home. This publication will help householders understand radon — what it is, its effect on heatlh, how to test for it, and some remodeling or new building techniques that can reduce radon levels in the home...|$|R

50|$|In {{geotechnical}} engineering, an interceptor ditch {{is a small}} ditch or channel {{constructed to}} intercept and drain water to an area {{where it can be}} safely discharged. These are used for excavation purposes of limited depth made in a coarse-grained soils. These are constructed around an area to be dewatered. <b>Sump</b> <b>pits</b> are also placed at suitable intervals for installation of centrifugal pumps to remove the water collected in an efficient manner. In fine sands and silts, there may be sloughing, erosion or quick conditions. For such type of soils the method is confined to a depth of 1 to 2 m. Interceptor ditches are most economical for carrying away water which emerge on the slopes and {{near the bottom of the}} foundation pit. Its size depends on the original ground slope, runoff area, type of soil and vegetation, and other factors related to runoff volume.|$|R
40|$|We have logged {{continuous}} radon, differential air {{pressures and}} other characteristics for eight houses built with radon-resistant features by Habitat for Humanity of Dane County. Pressures logged in {{the bases of}} the passive stacks were predominantly below basement air pressure, varying with time, while pressures in the sealed <b>sump</b> <b>pits</b> were above basement air pressure. Wind speed, wind direction and outdoor temperature affected the depressurization in the stack bases. With the stacks closed, the pressures in their bases increased to about 2 Pascals above basement air, and indoor radon increased by factors of 1. 3 to 8 among the houses. In some houses, when appliance fans withdrawing air from the house envelope were operated, they pulled the basement air pressure below the pressure {{in the base of}} the stack, and bursts of indoor radon resulted. Basement radon averaged 1, 1. 3, 2. 6, 2. 8, 3. 8, 4. 0, 4. 0, and 12 pCi/L in winter in the eight houses. The latter house, which had poor sealing of basement floor-wall joints, was mitigated to 0. 5 pCiIL with a 14 -watt fan...|$|R
50|$|Thorough {{mechanical}} cleaning of drains will remove the larval food source, {{and is the}} most effective control measure. Alternatively, injected foams containing bacteria or enzymes may be useful to break down gelatinous scum deposits. Besides sink drains, floor drains and shower drains are common sources, as well as leaky shower pans, but any location with moist decaying organic matter can be a breeding site. In commercial buildings, <b>sump</b> pump <b>pits,</b> sewers, and elevator pits may trap moisture where drain flies can breed.|$|R
40|$|Landfills {{within the}} DOE Complex as of 1990 are {{estimated}} to contain 3 million cubic meters of buried waste. The DOE facilities where the waste is predominantly located are at Hanford, the Savannah River Site (SRS), the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL), the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR), the Nevada Test Site (NTS), and the Rocky Flats Plant (RFP). Landfills include buried waste, whether on pads or in trenches, <b>sumps,</b> ponds, <b>pits,</b> cribs, heaps and piles, auger holes, caissons, and sanitary landfills. Approximately half of all DOE buried waste was disposed of before 1970. Disposal regulations at that time permitted the commingling of various types of waste (i. e., transuranic, low-level radioactive, hazardous). As a result, much of the buried waste throughout the DOE Complex is presently believed to be contaminated with both hazardous and radioactive materials. DOE buried waste typically includes transuranic-contaminated radioactive waste (TRU), low-level radioactive waste (LLW), hazardous waste per 40 CFR 26 1, greater-than-class-C waste per CFR 61 55 (GTCC), mixed TRU waste, and mixed LLW. The mission of the Landfill Stabilization Focus Area is to develop, demonstrate, and deliver safer,more cost-effective and efficient technologies which satisfy DOE site needs for the remediation and management of landfills. The LSFA is structured into five technology areas to meet the landfill remediation and management needs across the DOE complex. These technology areas are: assessment, retrieval, treatment, containment, and stabilization. Technical tasks {{in each of these}} areas are reviewed...|$|R
50|$|Paint {{spray booths}} for {{vehicles}} are typically 100-300 {{feet in length}} and usually contain many robotic and manual spray zones. The temperature and humidity are rigorously controlled in these systems. As items are painted in these booths, {{a certain amount of}} paint does not contact the article being painted and forms a fine mist of paint in the air space surrounding the article. This paint must be removed from the air. To accomplish this, the contaminated air is pulled through the paint spray booth by exhaust fans. A curtain of circulating water is maintained across the path of the air {{in such a way that}} the air must pass through the water curtain to reach the exhaust fans. As the air passes through the water curtain, the paint mist is “scrubbed” from the air and carried to a <b>sump</b> basin (sludge <b>pit),</b> usually located below the paint spray booth. In this area, the paint particles are separated from the water so that the water may be recycled and the paint particles disposed of as paint sludge. The paint detackifiers commonly added to these systems are either melamine-formaldehyde based, based upon acrylic acid chemistry, or chitosan.|$|R
40|$|PGV {{proposes that}} the GRP be amended to allow PGV {{to develop and}} operate a 60 MW {{geothermal}} power project consisting ofmultiple power generating units up to 30 geothermal wells drilled within the subject property, brine and steam pipelines, pollution control equipment, steam separators, production and injection wells, associated wellfield equipment, holding ponds, switch yards, office buildings, warehouses, workshops, control buildings, access roads, and auxiliary facilities such as an air compressors, fire protection equipment, etc., all {{in a manner consistent}} with applicable standards and permits. The project will occupy approximately 25 net acres ofsurface area located within the Kapoho Section ofthe Kilauea Lower East Rift Geothermal Resource Subzone. Each drilling site will be engineered to support the drilling equipment and to keep drilling effluent contained on site and separate from any natural drainage. Each wellpad will have drilling mud <b>pits,</b> <b>sumps</b> with gently sloped walls used to temporarily store drilling wastes which typically consist of rock cuttings, waste drilling mud, cement particles, lost-circulation material and other drilling mud additives, and other waste drilling liquids. The high porosity of the volcanic soils and rock in the site area results in rapid downward percolation of rainwater. Berms will be provided to contain possible spills in areas where chemicals are handled. Catch basins, culverts, ditches, and berms will be provided for drainage control. In accordance with the requirements of the Department of Health NSP, geothermal emissions will be vented through an approved abatement device during well/pipeline cleanouts. Noise will be generated during well drilling, construction, and operational phases of the project. However, the sites have been located in agricultural areas away from urban population concentrations. The sites will also be located to take advantage of existing topography and vegetation to muffle or block noise from the drilling operations. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{intent of}} this project is to {{determine}} whether the Waste Encapsulation and Storage Facility (WESF) floor drain piping and the TK- 100 sump are free from contamination. TK- 100 is currently used as a catch tank to transfer low level liquid waste from WESF to Tank Farms via B Plant. This system is being modified as part of the WESF decoupling since B Plant is being deactivated. As a result of the 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (TCA) discovery in TK- 100, the associated WESF floor drains and the <b>pit</b> <b>sump</b> need to be sampled. Breakdown constituents have been reviewed and found to be non-hazardous. There are 29 floor drains that tie into a common header leading into the tank. To prevent high exposure during sampling of the drains, TK- 100 will be removed into the B Plant canyon and a new tank will be placed in the pit before any floor drain samples are taken. The sump will be sampled prior to TK- 100 removal. A sample of the sludge and any liquid in the sump will be taken and analyzed for TCA and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). After the sump has been sampled, the vault floor will be flushed. The flush will be transferred from the sump into TK- 100. TK- 100 will be moved into B Plant. The vault will then be cleaned of debris and visually inspected. If there is no visual indication of TCA or PCB staining, the vault will be painted and a new tank installed. If there is an indication of TCA or PCB from laboratory analysis or staining, further negotiations will be required to determine a path forward. A total of 8 sets of three 40 ml samples will be required for all of the floor drains and sump. The sump set will include one 125 ml solid sample. The only analysis required will be for TCA in liquids. PCBs will be checked in sump solids only. The Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) is written to provide direction for the sampling and analytical activities of the 29 WESF floor drains and the TK- 100 sump. The intent of this plan is to define the responsibilities of the various organizations involved in sampling and analyzing the WESF floor drains and TK- 100 sump...|$|R
40|$|The {{groundwater}} inflow into a mine {{during its}} life and after ceasing operations {{is one of}} the most important concerns of the mining industry. This paper presents a hydrogeological assessment of the Irankuh Zn-Pb mine at 20 km south of Esfahan and 1 km northeast of Abnil in west-Central Iran. During mine excavation, the upper impervious bed of a confined aquifer was broken and water at high-pressure flowed into an open pit mine associated with the Kolahdarvazeh deposit. The inflow rates were 6. 7 and 1. 4 m 3 /s at the maximum and minimum quantities, respectively. Permeability, storage coefficient, thickness and initial head of the fully saturated confined aquifer were 3. 5 [*]x[*] 10 − 4 m/s, 0. 2, 30 m and 60 m, respectively. The hydraulic heads as a function of time were monitored at four observation wells in the vicinity of the pit over 19 weeks and at an observation well near a test well over 21 h. In addition, by measuring the rate of pumping out from the <b>pit</b> <b>sump,</b> at a constant head (usually equal to height of the pit floor), the real inflow rates to the pit were monitored. The main innovations of this work were to make comparison between numerical modelling using a finite element software called SEEP/W and actual data related to inflow and extend the applicability of the numerical model. This model was further used to estimate the hydraulic heads at the observation wells around the pit over 19 weeks during mining operations. Data from a pump-out test and observation wells were used for model calibration and verification. In order to evaluate the model efficiency, the modelling results of inflow quantity and hydraulic heads were compared to those from analytical solutions, as well as the field data. The mean percent error in relation to field data for the inflow quantity was 0. 108. It varied between 1. 16 and 1. 46 for hydraulic head predictions, which are much lower values than the mean percent errors resulted from the analytical solutions (from 1. 8 to 5. 3 for inflow and from 2. 16 to 3. 5 for hydraulic head predictions). The analytical solutions underestimated the inflow compared to the numerical model for the time period of 2 - 19 weeks. The results presented in this paper can be used for developing an effective dewatering program...|$|R
