40|$|Crystalline {{colloidal}} array (CCA) photonic crystals (PCs) are periodic structures {{formed by}} the self-assembly of monodisperse, highly-charged particles in low ionic strength aqueous solutions. Similar to an atomic crystal but with much larger lattice spacings, the CCA can efficiently diffract light in the UV, visible and near-IR spectral regions. This thesis reports {{the development of new}} CCA materials, novel CCA Bragg diffraction devices, and utilization of CCA PC templates for new nanostructure and nanomaterial fabrication. We use CCA for development of a CCA deep UV narrow band filter that acts as a Rayleigh rejection filter for UV Raman spectroscopy and for templates for solid-state UV Raman cross section determinations. We developed novel CCA PC deep UV Bragg diffraction devices. We synthesized small, monodisperse, highly surface-charged silica particles and prepared novel silica CCA through the self-assembly of these particles. The silica CCA efficiently Bragg diffract light in the deep UV. The diffracted wavelength was varied by tilting the CCA orientation to the incident beam. We demonstrated the utility of the silica CCA filter as a Rayleigh rejection filter in Teflon UV Raman measurements. We conducted the first resonance Raman cross-section measurements of solids that avoids self-absorption bias by using PC templates. We fabricated complex stoichiometrically defined nanoparticles (NaNO 3 /Na 2 SO 4 nanoparticles) by utilizing the defined interstitial volume of close-packed PCs. We successfully determined the solid-state NaNO 3 UV resonance Raman cross-sections by using solid Na 2 SO 4 as an internal standard. We also developed a refractive-index matching method to measure solid-state Na 2 SO 4 UV Raman cross sections that avoids the effect of the local field and avoids interface scattering of the incident light. We developed a facile method to fabricate silica <b>shell</b> <b>PCs</b> through the use of flexible poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) core templates. We synthesized monodisperse PNIPAm-silica core-shell particles and demonstrated their reversible swelling and shrinking as the temperature is cycled.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a comprehensive study of the X-ray emission from the supernova remnant IC 443, using the solid state spectrometer, IPC, and high-resolution images of the Einstein Observatory, and the medium-energy detector of the HEAO 1 A- 2 experiment. A soft X-ray appearance was observed, highly atypical of a supernova remnant in the adiabatic phase, with little correlation between X-ray and optical or radio features. The best-fit models of the low-energy X-ray spectrum of the brightest area of the remnant suggest either that the remnant has not yet attained ionization equilibrium or that the X-rays arise in a multiphase medium. Pronounced soft X-ray spectral differences across the remnant are accounted for by variations in absorption by an intervening molecular cloud.

5000|$|The first {{claim of}} a dust shell {{surrounding}} Betelgeuse was put forth in 1977 {{when it was}} noted that dust shells around mature stars often emit large amounts of radiation in excess of the photospheric contribution. Using heterodyne interferometry, it was concluded that the red supergiant emits most of its excess radiation from positions beyond 12 stellar radii or roughly the distance of the Kuiper belt at 50 to 60 AU, which depends on the assumed stellar radius. Since then, there have been studies done of this dust envelope at varying wavelengths yielding decidedly different results. Studies from the 1990s have estimated the inner radius of the dust shell anywhere from 0.5 to 1.0 arcseconds, or 100 to 200 AU. These studies point out that the dust environment surrounding Betelgeuse is not static. In 1994, it was reported that Betelgeuse undergoes sporadic decades long dust production, followed by inactivity. In 1997, significant changes in the dust shell's morphology in one year were noted, suggesting that the shell is asymmetrically illuminated by a stellar radiation field strongly affected by the existence of photospheric hotspots. The 1984 report of a giant asymmetric dust <b>shell</b> 1 <b>pc</b> (...) has not been corroborated by recent studies, although another published the same year said that three dust shells were found extending four light-years {{from one side of the}} decaying star, suggesting that Betelgeuse sheds its outer layers as it moves.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} we address the {{question}} whether light-induced changes in the Mg(II) content in the chloroplast lumen can modulate the electron donation to photosystem I, in particular the electrostatic interaction between plastocyanin (Pc) and the photosystem 1 subunit PsaF. For this, we have used 2 D NMR spectroscopy to study the binding of Mg(II) ions and the isolated luminal domain of PsaF to 15 N-labelled Pc. From the chemical-shift perturbations in the 1 H- 15 N HSQC spectra, dissociation constants of (4. 9 ± 1. 7) mM and (1. 4 ± 0. 2) mM were determined for the Pc-Mg(II) and Pc-PsaF complexes, respectively. In both cases, significant chemical-shift changes were observed for Pc backbone amide groups belonging to the two acidic patches, residues 42 – 45 and 59 – 61. In addition, competitive effects were observed upon the addition of Mg(II) ions to the Pc-PsaF complex, further strengthening that Mg(II) and PsaF bind to the same region on Pc. To structurally elucidate the Mg(II) binding site we have utilized Mn(II) as a paramagnetic analogue of Mg(II). The paramagnetic relaxation enhancement induced by Mn(II) results in line broadening in the Pc HSQC spectra {{which can be used}} to estimate distances between the bound ion and the affected nuclear spins. The calculations suggest a location of the bound Mn(II) ion close to Glu 43 in the lower acidic patch, and most likely {{in the form of a}} hexaquo complex embedded within the hydration <b>shell</b> of <b>Pc.</b> The results presented here suggest a specific binding site for Mg(II) that may regulate the binding of Pc to photosystem 1 in vivo...|$|R

30|$|High-temperature surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) detection is a {{vital part}} for practical sensing, which can be employed for monitoring many in situ reactions, e.g., thermal crystallization [1], structural variations [2, 3], and chemical reactions [4, 5] at elevated temperatures. However, bare metal nanostructures suffer from the inherently low melting point [6, 7], which causes the morphological instability of nano-sized metal and as a result, may deteriorate their SERS performances at high temperatures [2 – 4, 8 – 10]. Lately, core-shell nanostructures of metal core covered with protective oxide layer have been proposed as good SERS substrates for high-temperature Raman sensing [2, 3, 5, 8 – 10]. For example, wrapping Ag nanorods (Ag NRs) with an ultrathin (~ 1.5  nm) but dense Al 2 O 3 layer could make the substrate robust in morphology at 400  °C and stabilize its SERS efficiency [10]. Most recently, novel metal@oxide structures with pinhole-containing (<b>PC)</b> <b>shells</b> have drawn tremendous attention, which could not only increase the working temperature of SERS substrates moderately [10], but also exhibited even better SERS properties and broader application fields compared with metal@oxide substrates of compact shells [11, 12].

Structural and dynamic properties of molecular dynamics trajectories of these Pcs in solution were evaluated. The hydration <b>shells</b> of the <b>Pcs</b> were defined by means of spheroids adapted to the solute shape. Structural analysis of the axial region compared to the peripheral region indicates {{that there are no}} significant changes among the different macrocycles, but that of [CuPc(SO 3) 4] 4 −, where the polyoxoanion presence induces a typically hydrophilic hydration structure. The analyzed water dynamic properties cover mean residence times, translational and orientational diffusion coefficients, and hydrogen bond network. These properties allow a thorough discussion about the simultaneous existence of hydrophobic and hydrophilic hydration in these macrocycles, and indicate the trend of water structure to well define shells in the environment of hydrophobic solutes. The comparison between the structural and dynamical analysis of the hydration of the amphipathic [CuPc(SO 3) 4] 4 − and the non-soluble Cu–Pc shows a very weak coupling among the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments of the macrocycle. Quantitative results are employed to revisit the iceberg model proposed by Frank and Evans, leading to conclude that structure and dy- namics support a non-strict interpretation of the iceberg view, although the qualitative trends pointed out by the model are supported.

40|$|In {{this letter}} we present the first {{images of the}} {{emission}} of SiO and H 13 CO + in {{the nucleus of the}} starburst galaxy M 82. Contrary to other molecular species, which mainly trace the distribution of the star forming molecular gas within the disk, the SiO emission extends noticeably out of the galaxy plane. The bulk of the SiO emission is restricted to two major features. The first feature, referred to as the SiO supershell, is an open <b>shell</b> of 150 <b>pc</b> diameter, located 120 pc west from the galaxy center. The SiO supershell represents the inner front of a molecular shell expanding at ∼ 40 kms − 1, produced by mass ejection around a supercluster of young stars containing SNR 41. 95 + 57. 5. The second feature is a vertical filament, referred to as the SiO chimney, emanating from the disk at 200 pc east from the galaxy center. The SiO chimney reaches a 500 pc vertical height and it is associated with the most prominent chimney identified in radiocontinuum maps. The kinematics, morphology, and fractional abundances of the SiO gas features in M 82 can be explained in the framework of shocked chemistry driven by local episodes of gas ejection from the starburst disk. The SiO emission stands out as a privileged tracer of the disk-halo interface in M 82. We speculate that the chimney and the supershell, each injecting ∼ 10 7 M ⊙ of molecular gas, are two different evolutionary stages in the outflow phenomenon building up the gaseous halo. ...|$|R

A superposed epoch analysis of these data was conducted for several categories of disturbed geomagnetic conditions, including magnetic storms, high-speed streams, and storm sudden commencements.

40|$|NGC 5471 B {{has been}} {{suggested}} to contain a hypernova because of its extraordinarily bright X-ray emission. To assess its true nature, we have obtained high-resolution images in continuum bands and nebular lines with the Hubble Space Telescope, and high-dispersion long-slit spectra with the Kitt Peak National Observatory 4 m echelle spectrograph. The images reveal three supernova remnant (SNR) candidates in the giant H II region NGC 5471, the brightest one being the 77 × 60 <b>pc</b> <b>shell</b> in NGC 5471 B. The Hα velocity profile of NGC 5471 B can be decomposed into a narrow component (FWHM 41 km s- 1) from the background H II region and a broad component (FWHM 148 km s- 1) from the SNR shell. Using the brightness ratio of the broad to narrow components and the Hα flux measured from the WFPC 2 Hα image, we derive a Hα luminosity of (1. 4 ± 0. 1) × 1039 ergs s- 1 for the SNR shell. The [S II] λ 6716 /λ 6731 doublet ratio of the broad velocity component is used to derive an electron density of ~ 700 cm- 3 in the SNR shell. The mass of the SNR shell is thus 4600 ± 500 M. With a ~ 330 km s- 1 expansion velocity implied by the extreme velocity extent of the broad component, the kinetic energy of the SNR shell is determined to be 5 × 1051 ergs. This requires an explosion energy greater than 1052 ergs, which can be provided by one hypernova or multiple supernovae. Comparing to SNRs in nearby active star formation regions, the SNR shell in NGC 5471 B appears truly unique and energetic.

In the region cospatial with the radio jet, where the brightest emission line knots are located, the velocity field is highly perturbed, showing two velocity systems separated {{by as much as}} 1700 km s-ˡ. In several locations the split lines form almost complete velocity ellipsoids, implying that we are seeing an expanding shell of gas. The diameter of this <b>shell</b> (~ 200 <b>pc)</b> is much larger than the width of the radio jet (d ~ 2 x 10 42 ergs s-ˡ, required to inflate the cocoon; we estimate that the jet minimum advance speed is 3 x 10 -³ pc yr-ˡ. The total kinetic energy of the high-velocity gas associated with the radio jet can be estimated as ~ 6 x 10 54 ergs, comparable to the total energy carried by the jet over its lifetime; this quantitatively supports the idea that the NLR gas is accelerated by the jet. Radio outflows are associated with at least 50 % of Seyfert galaxies with typical sizes smaller than a few kpc. If the advance speed of Mrk 3 is representative of the Seyfert population, then these sources must also be short lived and are probably recurrent. Evidence that this is indeed the case is provided {{by the fact that the}} expansion timescale derived for NGC 1068 is comparable to that seen in Mrk 3. The jet kinetic luminosity of Mrk 3 is between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that derived for radio-loud AGNs with similar emission-line luminosity.

We speculate that the main distinction between radio-quiet and radio-loud active galactic nuclei can be ascribed to a dierence in jet power rather than to a dierent efficiency in synchrotron emission production...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we test and expand our current {{knowledge}} of Star Formation Laws (SF laws) {{in the extreme}} environment of dwarf irregular galaxies. We focus on the SF characteristics of our 18 galaxies sample, extending current investigations of the Schmidt-Kennicutt law to the low luminosity, low metallicity regime. The Hi data used in this project have been observed, calibrated and imaged according to the LITTLE THINGS Survey prescription to which I brought my own contribution {{as a member of}} the team. Apart from high resolution, VLA data in B, C and D array con gurations, this project makes use of an extensive set of multi- wavelength data (H, FUV, 24 m, 3. 6 m, V-band and K-band). Molecular gas in dwarfs is very di fficult to observe, mainly because due to the low metallicity environment, we lose our only molecular tracer, the CO which becomes under luminous. Therefore the gas distribution is represented by Hi gas only. We create our Star Formation Rate (SFR) maps mainly based on FUV maps because our analysis shows that FUV is the SF tracer that allows us the most extensive sampling of the SFR surface density (SFRD) and Hi surface density relation. The main results of our study are: Whereas in spiral galaxies Bigiel et al. (2008) have found a one to one relation between star formation rate and molecular gas and no relation between the SFR and the neutral gas, in a small sample of dwarfs as well as in the outskirts of spiral galaxies Bigiel et al.

We con rm the existence of the SFRD vs. Hi surface density relation in dwarf irregular galaxies and a linear fitting through all our data (all 18 galaxies combined) yields a power law relation SFR / 1 : 87 0 : 3 HI. We find that the interiors of Hi <b>shells,</b> at 400 <b>pc</b> scales, become resolved and show up in SFRD versus Hi surface density plots although within the shell interior we have SFRD values but no Hi surface density related to them.
