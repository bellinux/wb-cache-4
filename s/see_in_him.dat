5|$|The {{reign of}} PedroII thus {{came to an}} unusual end—he was overthrown while highly {{regarded}} by the people and {{at the pinnacle of}} his popularity, and some of his accomplishments were soon brought to naught as Brazil slipped into a long period of weak governments, dictatorships, and constitutional and economic crises. The men who had exiled him soon began to <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> a model for the Brazilian republic. A few decades after his death, his reputation was restored and his remains were returned to Brazil with celebrations nationwide. Historians have regarded the Emperor in an extremely positive light and several have ranked him as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the school}} year, Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The {{competition}} is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him.</b> Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug and tells him to return next year. The film ends with a freeze-frame shot of Nikumbh tossing Ishaan into the air.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} and social assumptions underlying the early Robin Hood ballads have long been controversial. It has been influentially argued by J. C. Holt that the Robin Hood legend was cultivated in the households of the gentry, {{and that it would}} be mistaken to <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> a figure of peasant revolt. He is not a peasant but a yeoman, and his tales make no mention of the complaints of the peasants, such as oppressive taxes. He appears not so much as a revolt against societal standards as an embodiment of them, being generous, pious, and courteous, opposed to stingy, worldly, and churlish foes. Other scholars have by contrast stressed the subversive aspects of the legend, and see in the medieval Robin Hood ballads a plebeian literature hostile to the feudal order.|$|E
60|$|Object. But I <b>see</b> {{not that}} <b>in</b> Christ now, that I have <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> former days. Besides, I find the Spirit lead me forth to study other things.|$|R
60|$|Ezra Jennings {{looked at}} me with the first {{appearance}} of embarrassment which I had <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> yet.|$|R
60|$|Bert stepped {{backward}} {{with a sort}} {{of action}} she had never <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> before. It seemed to alter his whole body.|$|R
2500|$|What was the {{youthful}} charm that so fired Eppia? What hooked her? What did she <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> {{to make her}} put up with being called [...] "the gladiator's moll"? Her poppet, her Sergius, was no chicken, with a dud arm that prompted hope of early retirement. Besides his face looked a proper mess, helmet-scarred, a great wart on his nose, an unpleasant discharge always trickling from one eye. But he was a gladiator. That word makes the whole breed seem handsome, and made her prefer him to her children and country, her sister, her husband. Steel is what they fall in love with.|$|E
60|$|Hardyman {{put his arm}} {{round her}} with a {{gentleness}} which his oldest friend would have been surprised to <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL. Never met such {{a fellow}} in my life, the most opinionated, narrow-minded--thinks he knows everything. Whatever Letty could <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> I can't think. Pragmatical beggar! ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Seeing</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> {{one who was}} to be set in {{authority}} over me, I surveyed him with the profoundest interest, and from that instant I disliked him.|$|R
50|$|The {{eldest son}} of Qari Mohammed Saeed Chishti late; resides in Pakistan and {{performs}} qawwali around the world. An {{reflection of his}} father's style is <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{believe he}} has," [...] said Dorothea, {{with the full}} voice of decision. [...] "Everything I <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> {{corresponds}} to his pamphlet on Biblical Cosmology." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{they can}} <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> I can’t think," [...] muttered Mr. Thompson, in an envious whisper. [...] "He’s a perfick terror, {{and to look}} at him——" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} are always looking after him," [...] grumbled Charles. [...] "I can't guess what all the women <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> to be always gazing after him." ...|$|E
60|$|His madness foiled his reason, and {{a puzzled}} look spread over his face as, shaking {{his head with a}} {{decision}} which I had but seldom <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Alec {{sprang up}} and {{stretched}} his legs. As he spoke all signs of lassitude disappeared, {{and he was}} seized with an excitement that was rarely <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} it is true. It {{is not the kind of}} {{weakness}} I have <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>him.</b> He is weak and vain, but I should have said that he was true." ...|$|R
60|$|Baynes, who had {{at first}} felt {{inclined}} to take offense {{at the mention}} of his private affairs by this common fellow, was mollified by Hanson's final remark, and immediately commenced to <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> a man of fine discrimination.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you Masr-ed-Deen, the {{merchant}} of Alexandria, {{or is it}} from far Bagdad that you bring your goods, O, my uncle; and yonder one-eyed youth, do I <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> {{one of the three}} kings of whom Scheherazade told stories to her lord?" ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this is too}} vague for you, I do not doubt, but for me the man and {{his work}} have an {{attraction}} I cannot very well explain, like the personal influence of one who is your friend, though other people cannot see what you <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mrs Fyne moved {{a little}} in her chair. I turned to her and remarked gently {{that this was a}} charge, a criticism, which was often made. Some people always ask: What could he <b>see</b> <b>in</b> her? Others wonder what she could have <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>him?</b> Expressions of unsuitability.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your son, sir, if not openly {{vowed to}} God, has, I hope, a due {{sense of that}} inward {{vocation}} which we have <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>him,</b> and reverences his spiritual fathers too well {{to listen to the}} temptations of his earthly father." ...|$|R

60|$|When I {{think of}} all the misery and pain which he is trying to remedy--I can <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> only a power for good. He is not working for himself but for the many. That is why he has no money. You have heaven alone knows how many millions--you don't; you have worked for yourself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Madison! It's Violet. She is {{behaving}} abominably. She treated poor Ned shamefully tonight. You saw yourself how {{she acted}} with Spencer, and she's going to Loon Lake with him tomorrow, she says. I'm sure I don't {{know what she}} can <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him.</b> He's the dullest, pokiest fellow alive--so different from her in every way." ...|$|E
6000|$|And he, another time: [...] "What the deuce did you <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> anyway? I {{know he had}} money. But you and I were {{managing}} {{to get along with}} some sort of comfort. My practice was averaging around forty thousand a year then--I went over the books afterward. Palaces and steam yachts were about all that was denied you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fine. That fellow Gray {{is still}} hanging round Babe. It beats {{me what she}} <b>sees</b> <b>in</b> <b>him.</b> Anybody but an infant could see the man wasn't on the level. Well, I don't blame you for quitting London, George. This sort of thing is worth fifty Londons." ...|$|R

5000|$|Pierre Gamarra died in Argenteuil on May 20, 2009, {{leaving a}} {{substantial}} body of work, as yet untranslated into English.

6000|$|... "Be {{a friend}} to him. Let him like you, let him love you. I dare say you <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> now much to pity and to wonder at.

6000|$|... "Heavens, it may be! {{and that}} would account for the change we <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>him.</b> I thought {{he was in love}} with the widow, but that may be only a cloak to hide darker designs. Karl brought us here, and I dare say it is a den of conspirators!" [...] cried Amy, feeling as if she were getting more of an {{adventure}} than she had bargained for.|$|E
60|$|Again,--That {{man could}} utterly trust God. For when St. John {{and his companions}} (simple fishermen) beheld the glory of Jesus, the Incarnate Word, what was it like? It was 'full of grace and truth;' the {{perfection}} of human graciousness, of human truthfulness, which could win and melt the hearts of simple folk, and make them <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>Him,</b> who was called the carpenter's son, {{the beauty of the}} glory of the Godhead.|$|E
60|$|I say, What hast thou <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>him?</b> Men must <b>see</b> {{something}} <b>in</b> Jesus Christ, {{else they}} will not come to him. 1. What comeliness hast thou <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> his person? thou comest not, if thou seest no form nor comeliness <b>in</b> <b>him</b> (Isa 53:1-3). 2. Until those mentioned in the Song were convinced {{that there was more}} beauty, comeliness, and desirableness in Christ, than in ten thousand, they did not so much as ask where he was, nor incline to turn aside after him (Song 5, 6).|$|R
50|$|Highflyer was a bay {{stallion}} with a sock on a hind pastern.

His abilities on the track could have been foreseen in his very muscular hindquarters, sloping shoulder, and deep barrel.|$|R
5000|$|Drafted {{from the}} Ontario Hockey League's Ottawa 67's, Ambroziak debuted with Buffalo's American Hockey League affiliates, the Rochester Americans, in the 1991-92 season; however he never {{fulfilled}} the potential that the scouts had <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>him.</b> [...] He {{played with the}} Americans for parts of four seasons, and made a dozen NHL appearances with the Sabres during the 1994-95 season.|$|R
