40|$|There {{is clearly}} {{much work to}} be done on science in the Japanese colonial empire and on {{colonialism}} as a category in the Japanese sciences. Political considerations are partly to blame for delaying this research program, though we seem now at the point where Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese and other scholars can work productively together. That the present volume includes, for example, a Korean scholar of Japanese science writing about Taiwan (Kim) demonstrates how cosmopolitan the STS research community in East Asia is becoming, and what stands to be accomplished by both individual and group effort. Likewise, the founding of the East Asian <b>STS</b> <b>Network</b> (and this journal) bodes well for the likelihood that long-neglected issues relating to knowledge creation in Japan’s colonial empire will attract attention, and from multiple perspectives. What then, are some of these issues? In choosing to write about meteorology, seismology, and bacteriology, the authors in this volume have focused on sciences with more to reveal about knowledge creation and social control than about wealth creation and strategic positioning. The ‘cultural turn’, in other words, so long in coming to historical scholarship on science in Asia, is being made. Race, for example, is a category of interest to all three papers, and one extending beyond social history to the content and practice of science. The old model of “transfer ” has also ceased to be controlling. The authors rather seek contrasts in the character of science projects in colony and metropole, with knowledge sometimes traveling in both directions, or even outside the frame.

40|$|Given a spatio-temporal <b>network</b> (<b>ST</b> <b>network)</b> where edge {{properties}} {{vary with}} time, a time-sub-interval {{minimum spanning tree}} (TSMST) {{is a collection of}} minimum spanning trees of the <b>ST</b> <b>network,</b> where each tree is associated with a time interval. During this time interval, the total cost of tree is least among all the spanning trees. The TSMST problem aims to identify a collection of distinct minimum spanning trees and their respective time-sub-intervals under the constraint that the edge weight functions are piecewise linear. This is an important problem in <b>ST</b> <b>network</b> application domains such as wireless sensor networks (e. g., energy efficient routing). Computing TSMST is challenging because the ranking of candidate spanning trees is non-stationary over a given time interval. Existing methods such as dynamic graph algorithms and kinetic data structures assume separable edge weight functions. In contrast, we propose novel algorithms to find TSMST for large <b>ST</b> <b>networks</b> by accounting for both separable and non-separable piecewise linear edge weight functions. The algorithms are based on the ordering of edges in edge-order-intervals and intersection points of edge weight functions...|$|R
40|$|Tough {{hydrogel}} {{materials have}} recently attracted broad attentions and interests. Due to their high fracture energies, they are promising candidates {{for a wide}} range of biological and biomechanical applications. Two important categories of tough hydrogels are Double Network hydrogel (DN) and ionic-covalent PAAm-alginate hybrid gel (abbreviated as the “hybrid gel”). Both gel systems exhibit interesting network structures and remarkably enhanced mechanical toughness with respect to the conventional covalently-crosslinked hydrogels. The objective of the present PhD study is to provide a quantitative analysis on the toughening mechanism and damage process for DN and the hybrid hydrogels. The investigation for each of the two hydrogel systems consisted of two sections. The first section was to study the effect of hydrogel network topologies on the mechanical properties. Hydrogel samples were synthesized with various chemical formulations to alter their network topologies. Tensile and tearing tests were then performed to characterize the mechanical strength and toughness of the resultant gels. In the second section, load/unload tests comprising a series of stretch/retract cycles were carried out, and some widely-used fracture models and theories were applied on the test results to determine the damage process for the tested hydrogel samples. Chapter 1 briefly introduces the research background, scope, objective, and methodology, and gives a literature review on the recent progress on the tough hydrogels. Chapter 2 investigates the influence of the 1 <b>st</b> <b>network</b> topology on the mechanical properties of DN gels. With an increase in the crosslinker or monomer concentration to prepare the 1 <b>st</b> <b>network,</b> mechanical strength and fracture energies of the DN gels increased. Lake-Thomas theory was applied to estimate the 1 <b>st</b> <b>network</b> toughness at relevant DN equilibrium, and a linear relation between the 1 <b>st</b> <b>network</b> and DN toughness was found. Chapter 3 presents the load/unload tests performed on DN gels prepared with various crosslinker or monomer concentration of the 1 <b>st</b> <b>network.</b> Gent and Wang-Hong model were fitted to the test results and a fracture process of DN gels was determined. The model parameters of Wang-Hong model, which are related to the probability distribution of strand fracture, were considered to describe the molecular weight distribution of the 1 <b>st</b> <b>network</b> strands. The model fit parameters were used to calculate the strand length distribution of the DN gels prepared with various crosslinker concentrations of the 1 <b>st</b> <b>network.</b> For the hybrid gel system, Chapter 4 elucidates the effect of tight (alginate) and loose (PAAm) network on the mechanical properties of PAAm-alginate hybrid gels. It was found that the hybrid gels were toughened by increasing the concentration of ionic crosslinker or decreasing the concentration of covalent crosslinker. More interestingly, the fracture toughness of the hybrid gel was found to be rate-dependent, and the gel also exhibited a very rapid and substantial stress relaxation which is distinctive from the conventional hydrogels. In Chapter 5, a three series of load/unload testes were sequentially conducted on the virgin PAAm-alginate hybrid gel and the damaged gel after a 1 st and 2 nd recovery process. The damage process of the hybrid gel was clearly demonstrated by the Gent and Wang-Hong model fits. For the tested gel, a partial recovery of the mechanical properties was evident between the 1 st and 2 nd series while the mechanical performances became fully reversible from the 2 nd to 3 rd series. All the research findings were summarized in Chapter 6 and some suggestions on the future work were also given...|$|R

40|$|Previously we {{revealed}} that the high toughness of double network hydrogels (DN gels) derives from the internal fracture of the brittle network during deformation, which dissipates energy as sacrificial bonds. In this study, we intend to elucidate the detailed internal fracture process of DN gels. We quantitatively analysed the tensile hysteresis and re-swelling behaviour of a DN gel that shows a well-defined necking and strain hardening, and obtained the following new findings: 1) Fracture of the 1 <b>st</b> <b>network</b> PAMPS starts far below the yielding strain, and 90 % of the initially load-bearing PAMPS chains already break at the necking point. 2) The dominant internal fracture process occurs in the necking and hardening region, although the softening mainly occurs before necking. 3) The internal fracture efficiency is very high, 85 % {{of the work is}} used for the internal fracture and 9 % of all PAMPS chains break at sample failure. 4) The internal fracture is anisotropic, fracture occurs preferentially perpendicular to the tensile direction than other two directions, but the fracture anisotropy decreases in the hardening region. Results 1) and 2) is in agreement with a hierarchical structural model of the PAMPS network. Based on these findings, we present a revised description of the fracture process of DN gels...|$|R
40|$|Tough double network (DN) hydrogels are {{a kind of}} interpenetrating network (IPN) gels with a {{contrasting}} structure; they {{consist of}} a rigid and brittle 1 <b>st</b> <b>network</b> with dilute, densely cross-linked short chains and a soft and ductile 2 nd network with concentrated, loosely cross-linked long chains. In this work, we focus on how the brittle gel changes into a tough one by increasing the amount of ductile component. By comparing the molecular structures of the individual first network and second network gels, we found that the true key mechanical factor that governs the brittle ductile transition is the fracture stress ratio of the two networks, sigma(f, 2) /sigma(f, 1). This ratio is related to the density ratio of elastically effective polymer strands of the two networks, nu(e, 2) /nu(e, 1), where the inter-network topological entanglement makes dominant contribution to nu(e, 2). When nu(e, 2) /nu(e, 1) k, only the first network fractures. As a result, the brittle first network serves as sacrificial bonds, imparting toughness of DN gels. The study also confirms that the load transfer between the two networks is via inter-network topological entanglement. This result provides essential information to design tough materials based on the double network concept. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
