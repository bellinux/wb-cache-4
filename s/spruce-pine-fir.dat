Besides pulpwood, rough lumber is the raw material for furniture-making and other items requiring additional cutting and shaping. It is available in many species, usually hardwoods; but it is also readily available in softwoods, such as white pine and red pine, because of their low cost. Finished lumber is supplied in standard sizes, mostly for the construction industry - primarily softwood, from coniferous species, including pine, fir and spruce (collectively <b>spruce-pine-fir),</b> cedar, and hemlock, but also some hardwood, for high-grade flooring.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== There {{are three}} {{altitude}} zone of floral {{communities in the}} reserve: northern taiga, subalpine (750-850 meters), and bald mountain (above 1,000-1,200 meters). [...] Below the bare mountain areas, the forests are typical of the West Siberian northern taiga: 38% dark coniferous <b>spruce-pine-fir</b> forest, 12% pine forest (in the eastern and southern parts of the reserve), and 35% mixed forest. In the understory, bushes such as rowan and raspberry are common. [...] Because the reserve is {{on the border between}} the west and east side of the Urals, it supports animals from both communities. For example, both martens and sable are resident. Moose and elk were formerly common, but have been affected by poaching in the surrounding area. In 1994 beavers were recorded as having moved back into the territory. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 37 species of mammals. The area is a site of international importance for birds; 140 species have been recorded, with 111 nesting. 10 species of bird in the Red Book of Russia are found, including the vulnerable Lesser white-fronted goose and the Falco vespertinus.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Threaded nails {{are used}} in wood {{construction}} because of their superior performance, but relatively few tests have been conducted on nails larger than 12 d (3. 76 mm diameter). Experience has suggested that threaded nail withdrawal design values are too conservative. The Forest Products Laboratory and Washington State University have been cooperatively characterizing the strength of threaded nails over a range of wood species and nail types. This paper focuses on the immediate withdrawal strength of annularly threaded nails in Douglas Fir and <b>Spruce-Pine-Fir,</b> helically threaded nails in Southern Pine, and smooth nails in Southern Pine and <b>Spruce-Pine-Fir</b> lumber. Average withdrawal strength of threaded nails was {{greater than that of}} smooth shank nails of the same diameter. In comparison of experimental withdrawal strength to existing design proce-dures for assigning allowable withdrawal strength design values, annular shank nails showed the greatest dif-ference. Withdrawal strengths of nails from five different manufacturers were not significantly different. Com-parisons of the effect of galvanizing on withdrawal strength were inconclusive...|$|E

For example, European Standard EN 16351 : 2013 [2] suggests that 1.1  MPa be used for edge-glued CLT products made out of common European softwood species without testing; In Canada, a much lower value of 0.5  MPa is recommended for CLT products made out of <b>Spruce-Pine-Fir</b> species group.|$|E
30|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of glue application and placement of butt-joints on the compressive and tensile properties in a butt-jointed lamination. The aim was to provide background information for producing butt-jointed, glued, laminated timber. Three butt-jointed lamination models were prepared from <b>spruce-pine-fir</b> (S-P-F) dimension lumber with glued and nonglued butt joints, with different placements of the butt joints in the models. The axial stiffness and strength properties were assessed using both compressive and tensile tests. The {{results of the study}} indicated that for the compressive lamination model the application of glue at the butt joint gave more stiffness than the nonglued butt joint. Neither glue application nor placement of the joint had a statistically significant effect on the compressive strength. There {{were no significant differences between}} the glued and nonglued butt joint for either tensile strength or stiffness.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} bending properties of domestic timber. Three representative struc-tural timber from Larix kaempferi, Pinus koraiensis, and Pinus densiflora, in the northeastern South Korea were selected. Visual grading for the timber was conducted based on KFRI notification 2009 - 01 and the bending strength for the timber was evaluated based on ASTM D 198 bending. The high percentage of grade 1 and 2 for Larix kaempferi shows that the KFRI notification was optimized for this species. The bending strength distributions from Pinus koraiensis and Pinus densiflora were very similar. It could be possible to specify the allowable bending properties of these two Specification using a united species group similar to <b>spruce-pine-fir.</b> Lastly, the bending strength of 120 × 180 mm structural members was higher than both existing values in KBC 2009 and design values for timber of imported species described in the NDS.

40|$|A {{number of}} species are harvested, processed, and marketed {{together}} within the hem-fir species group under the Western Wood Products Association grading rules (western hemlock, pacific silver fir, white fir, grand fir, California red fir, and noble fir). The out-of-kiln moisture content (MC) of these species varies considerably, both from board-to-board and within boards. This is usually attributed to wet pockets in the wood and compression wood. It is not known which of the hem-fir species, if any, are prone to high or low out-of-kiln MCs since the true firs are virtually indistinguishable after the foliage has been removed. Differential drying rates for species within other species groups are well known. As examples, in the fir-larch group, western larch ends up at a higher MC than Douglas-fir. In the <b>spruce-pine-fir</b> group, alpine fir will leave the kiln at the highest MC and white spruce the lowest. In this work, boards of six hem-fir species were dried and the MC of each board was measured {{as a function of}} time to investigate whether any one species contributes significantly to final moisture content variation.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in preservative pressure-treatment of framing lumber to prevent attack by decay fungi and insects. However, the <b>Spruce–Pine–Fir</b> species {{group that is}} often used in framing construction {{can be difficult to}} penetrate with preservatives. We compared solution uptake and penetration of boron and copper from a borax–copper (BC) preservative to that of boron in a disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT) treatment and copper in a chromated copper arsenate (CCA) treatment. For all wood species, average solution uptake was consistently greater with the DOT solution than with the BC or CCA solution. Average boron penetration with DOT was also greater than that for any BC solution. Immedi ately after treatment, boron penetration with DOT exceeded 10 mm in at least 80 % of specimens, indicating that the treatment could meet American Wood Preservers ’ Association (AWPA, 2003) pen etration standards. Following a 2 -week diffusion period, boron in BC treatments also met or exceeded AWPA standards in most cases. Copper penetration was much lower than boron penetration and did not meet AWPA standards in any species. Collapse was noted in some specimens treated with heated BC and DOT solutions...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on properties can be separated into reversible and permanent effects. The National Design Specification (NDS) provides factors (C t) for reducing properties for reversible effects but provides little guidance on permanent effects. Objectives. The primary {{objective of this}} paper is to evaluate the effect of prolonged heating (permanent effect) on the flexural properties of solid-sawn and composite lumber products exposed at 66 °C and 75 % relative humidity (RH) and at 82 °C and 30 % RH. A second objective is to determine how to estimate total effects. Procedures. Solid-sawn lumber, laminated veneer lumber (LVL), and laminated strand lumber (LSL) were heated continuously for up to 6 years. After each exposure period, the lumber was con-ditioned to room temperature at the specified RH and then tested on edge in third-point bending. Some lumber was also tested hot at 66 °C after 48 h of exposure and after 3 years of exposure. Results. After 3 years of continuous exposure at 66 °C and 75 % RH, solid-sawn <b>Spruce-Pine-Fir</b> (SPF) and Douglas-fir retained about 72 % of their original modulus of rupture (MOR) and southern pine about 47 %.

40|$|Bolted {{connections}} {{often fail}} by a shear plug or a splitting beneath the bolt caused by tension perpendicular-to-grain stresses as the bolt wedges {{its way through}} the wood. Pre-venting this type of failure would enhance the capacity and reliability of the bolted connection, thus increasing the over-all integrity of a timber structure and enabling wood to compete favorably with other engineering materials. This research investigated the use of fiberglass reinforcement to enhance the load-carrying capacity of bolted wood connec-tions. A series of specimens were prepared from standard 38 - by 89 -mm (nominal 2 - by 4 -in.) lumber from the <b>Spruce–Pine–Fir</b> lumber grouping. Matched specimens were reinforced with one, two, or three layers of bi-directional fiberglass cloth. Resulting test specimens were configured as a connection that was in accordance with current design specifications. A total of 80 single-bolt, double-shear connec-tions were tested; 40 parallel to grain and 40 perpendicular to grain. Results indicate that connection strength increases as the layers of fiberglass reinforcement increase. The largest in-crease occurred when adding the first layer to the nonrein-forced connection. Additional layers increased strength at a decreasing rate. The ultimate strength of a three-layer rein-forced connection was 33 percent greater than the nonrein-forced connection for parallel-to grain loading and more than 100 percent for perpendicular-to-grain loading. More impor-tantly for parallel-to-grain loading, the reinforcement changed the mode of failure from an abrupt, catastrophic type associ-ated with tension perpendicular-to-grain stresses to a ductile type associated with bearing stress...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the relationship of}} incising-induced strength loss in bending {{as a function of}} preservative treatment and incising pattern, density, and depth of penetration for various machine stress-rated (MSR) grades of full-size 2 by 4 Douglas-fir, Hem-Fir, and <b>Spruce-Pine-Fir</b> (South) dimension lumber. This study may represent a worst-case "incising effects" scenario: although the incising patterns and depths selected for study represent commonly used industrial practices, the incising process itself was performed on dry lumber, which is not the standard practice of the treating industry. As we had expected on the basis of Canadian results, incising affected bending properties, such as modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture, and work to maximum load. Our results show that the combined incising-preservative effect on mean property values for lumber incised in the dry condition prior to treatment was in the range of a 0 to 10 % loss in modulus of elasticity, 15 % to 25 % loss in modulus of rupture, and 30 % to 50 % loss in work to maximum load. The effect on properties {{at the lower end of}} the distribution, such as the allowable stress design value F, was equal to or less than that on mean properties for the three species groups evaluated. While these results specifically apply to only MSR-graded standard 38 -mm- (nominal 2 -inch-) thick lumber and to lumber incised in the dry condition prior to treatment, they do imply that the new U. S. design adjustments for C, in modulus of elasticity of 0. 95 and F, of 0. 85 may not be sufficient for incised and treated material used in dry in-service conditions...|$|E
40|$|The shear {{strengths}} of structural glued laminated timber (glulam) have been traditionally evaluated in the United States {{based on the}} procedures set forth in ASTM Standards D 3737 and D 2555 using small block shear values of clear wood specimens. For most glulam products, the design shear stresses so derived are conservative. In recent years, the demand to optimize the design shear stress has been increased due to a higher design shear stress offered by competing structural wood composites, such as laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and parallel strand lumber (PSL). Since 1997, APA has {{conducted a series of}} full-size shear tests on glulam manufactured with Douglas fir, Southern pine, and <b>Spruce-Pine-Fir.</b> A four-point load method with a clear distance between the edge of the reaction bearing plate {{to the edge of the}} nearest curved load bearing block of at least 2 times the specimen depth was used to test all specimens. Based on this experience, the full-size shear test method has been adopted in ASTM D 3737 as a standard test method for determining the horizontal shear strength of glulam. This paper provides detailed descriptions of the test methods, experimental results, and data analyses. The test results obtained from this study indicate that the characteristic shear strength values based on full-size shear tests are approximately 70 % of the values determined from small block shear tests. However, the allowable horizontal shear stress could be increased by a factor of at least 1. 25, including a 10 % reduction to allow for occasional seasoning checks. This increase can be attributed in part to the difference in the procedures used to derive the design value between the full-size and small block shear tests...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Current {{compression}} perpendicular-to-grain (c-perp) {{design values}} for wood members {{are based on}} mean stress using the ASTM D 143 specimen. Base design value, as determined from 0. 04 -in deformation in the ASTM specimen, is applied to all c-perp applications. While the standard ASTM test was presumably believed to adequately reflect relevant c-perp applications {{at the time it}} was developed (likely railroad cross-ties, wall plates and similar cross-sections), the specimen has limited applicability to many of today's c-perp bearing applications. Previous work has shown that wood-on-wood c-perp bearing is a more severe case as opposed to metal-on-wood bearing. End bearing conditions have been shown to represent a more severe c-perp loading scenario as opposed to load applied over central area. Research has shown that c-perp behavior of wood members is dependant on angle of applied load to annual ring orientation and that the most severe loading case is usually at an angle between 30 and 60 degrees to direction of applied load. Past studies also suggest that depth of member affects c-perp MOE and that higher aspect ratio may lead to instability of the member. As the c-perp behavior observed in the ASTM testing procedure is that of continually increasing stress with increasing deflection and densification, c-perp is generally believed to be serviceability rather than a life safety issue. However, in engineered wood applications, c-perp bearing may occur at areas where structural cohesiveness of a member is necessary to transmit forces through fasteners, such as truss plates. In such scenarios, c-perp has the potential to be a life safety issue. A study was designed to evaluate c-perp behavior of typical as-constructed assemblies in which members experience c-perp stresses near their longitudinal end through wood-on-wood contact. The study included both finite element analysis and experimental testing. Two as-constructed assemblies were evaluated in the study. These included assembly of the bottom chord of a truss bearing on the top plate of a wall (BC assembly) and assembly of the compression chord of a shear wall bearing on the bottom plate (BP assembly) of a wall. Finite element analysis modeled wood material as a composite with alternating earlywood and latewood layers with infinite radius of curvature. BC, BP and ASTM configurations were modeled both with load applied perpendicular and parallel to annual rings. Three BC assemblies were tested. These included BC- 2 X 4, BC- 2 X 8, and BC- 2 X 12, which had nominal 2 X 4, 2 X 8, and 2 X 12 members as bottom chord members, respectively. Therefore, within BC test assemblies aspect ratio of the bottom chord members varied greatly. The three BC geometries were each tested with both Douglas-fir and <b>Spruce-Pine-Fir</b> top plate material. BP configuration was also tested with both Douglas-fir and <b>Spruce-Pine-Fir</b> bottom plate material. For each test assembly, paired ASTM tests of the main member (bottom chord member in BC tests, and bottom plate member in BP tests) were conducted. Results were analyzed utilizing a variety of statistical methods. Finite element analysis revealed that strain was more uniform throughout depth of the bottom chord member when loaded perpendicular to annual rings than when loaded parallel to annual rings. In BC tests majority of deflection was found to occur in the bottom chord member. In BP test, the majority of deflection was found to occur within the bottom plate with only minimal deflection occurring in the longitudinally loaded compression chord. Due to varying assembly depths, 0. 04 -in, deflection was found to be a poor criterion for determining c-perp stress values. In order to account for assembly depth, stress values were based on system strain. As 0. 04 -in, deflection corresponds to two percent strain in the 2 -in, deep ASTM specimen, it was determined that stress determination be based on 2 -percent system strain. Due to large settlement effects observed in the tested wood-onwood assemblies, an offset strain was adopted as the method for determining and comparing stress values across differing assemblies and configurations tested. Within BC tests, the species of top plate material was not found to significantly affect assembly performance. This was due to the overwhelming influence of bottom chord behavior on system behavior. Within BP tests there was suggestive but inconclusive evidence of a significant difference between Douglas-fir and <b>Spruce-Pine-Fir</b> tests. It was recommended that further BP tests be conducted with larger sample sizes in order to determine the influence of wood species on c-perp behavior of bottom plate members. Mean stress values of BC and BP assembly tests were found to be significantly lower than that of corresponding ASTM tests of the main member. This finding lends justification to the Canadian 2 / 3 reduction factor for these scenarios as well as to the design procedures suggested by German researchers. It was determined that the ASTM c-perp test does not adequately represent these bearing scenarios. Adjustment factors are recommended for wood-on-wood bearing and opposite side end bearing. Aspect ratio was found to affect c-perp failure mode and led to high potential for sudden and catastrophic failure of members. Fifteen percent of 2 X 12 members tested failed prior to NDS design stresses due to premature failure of the nominal 2 X 12 bottom chord member. It was estimated that the odds of a 2 X 1 2 failing catastrophically are at least 16 times that of a 2 X 8 failing catastrophically. It was determined that as aspect ratio increases c-perp becomes a life safety as well as a serviceability issue and an adjustment factor for aspect ratio is recommended...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} mentioned problems in relation to processing beetle-killed wood in the British Columbia Interior is that of kiln drying charges consisting of both green and partly dried stock. This results from the fact that dead beetle-killed stems are currently harvested and processed along with green stems from the same stands. The losses, or additional costs, associated with the current procedures include the following: 1. extra cost to kiln dry already dry wood, 2. excessive degrade in the already dry stock, and 3. increased planer breakage due to overdry wood, and related planer production delays. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine some possible alternatives available for dealing with this problem, the equip-ment changes required, the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives and some related considerations. This is done within the framework of a series of studies designed to evaluate the economic merits of the alternatives. PROPOSAL In order to reduce the losses referred to above, it is proposed that the dry beetle-killed wood and green normal wood be segregated and the lumber dried separately. MILL TYPE The type of operation examined in the following alternatives is a typical British Columbian Interior <b>spruce-pine-fir</b> (S-P-F) dimension mill producing 2 x 4 to 2 x 10 in lengths from 8 to 20 feet, requiring 28 basic length and width sorts. SORTING ALTERNATIVES Four basic alternatives for sorting have been identified: 1. No change (control) : continue to run mixed dry and green stock throughout the operation; 2. Sort in woods: segregate dead (red top or older) from live stems as early as possible during harvesting. Haul them separately to the mill and store them separately in the yard; 3. Double the sorts: this alternative requires doubling the number of sorts in a typical bin sorter, and adding an in-line moisture meter to identify and separate the dry from the green pieces...|$|E
40|$|In the Unites States, the {{allowable}} {{horizontal shear}} stresses of structural glued laminated timber (glulam) have been traditionally determined {{based on the}} procedures set forth in ASTM Standards D 3737 and D 2555 using block shear values of small-clear wood specimens as the basis. In recent years, however, information has been generated, suggesting that the allowable shear stresses so derived may be overly conservative {{when compared to the}} results of full-size flexure tests. Unfortunately, all available U. S. data on full-size glulam tests, as related to shear strength, were either proprietary or conducted using a non standard test method. Moreover, the different test setups used by these studies made the data comparison difficult. A systematic evaluation on major wood species used in the production of glulam in the U. S. based on a consistent full-size flexure test method was considered critical by the U. S. glulam industry to determine the appropriate allowable horizontal shear stresses for glulam. During 1996 - 97, APA- The Engineered Wood Association conducted a total of 201 full-size tests on glulam manufactured with Douglas fir, Southern pine, and <b>Spruce-Pine-Fir.</b> A two-point load method with a clear distance between the edge of the reaction bearing plate {{to the edge of the}} nearest curved loading block of at least 2 times the specimen depth was used to test all specimens. Overall, 70 % of the specimens failed in the targeted shear mode, indicating that the test method used in this study can be considered as a practical standard test method for determining the horizontal shear strength of glulam. Results of this study indicated that the allowable horizontal shear stress for those species tested can be increased from the previously published values by a factor of at least 1. 25, including a 10 % reduction to allow for occasional seasoning checks.

40|$|Vegetation {{management}} practices {{have become an}} integral component of forest management. Economics of alternative vegetation management treatments were analyzed in this thesis {{on the basis of}} two journal papers. Six research sites established and managed by Vegetation Management Alternatives Program of Ontario were the sources of data. In the first paper, differences in stem quality, and volume and value of fibre produced by planted white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] 16 years after vegetation management treatments in northwestern Ontario were examined. Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVSOntario) was used to pro-ject the total and merchantable volume to age 70 and BUCK- 2 was used to opti-mize the resulting product mix. Projected value was based on 2009 prices for hog fuel and SPF (<b>spruce-pine-fir)</b> eastern green lumber prices. At 16 years post-treat-ment, gross total volumes in herbicide-treated and mechanically cut plots were significantly higher (120 - 165 % and 94 - 98 %, respectively) than that in control plots (14. 73 m 3 ha- 1). Based on height, diameter, and taper criteria, observed tree quality did not differ among treatments. The projected value of the fibre produced was 36 to 53 % higher in herbicide-treated plots and 24 to 37 % higher in mechanically cut plots than in control plots ($ 18, 486. 76 ha- 1). Second paper presents the stand-level benefit-cost analyses of 12 vegeta-tion management treatments applied at six study sites in northern Ontario. Net present value (NPV), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and internal rate of return (IRR) for crop and all species in each treatment and site were calculated and compared using 2009 constant dollars and variable real discount rates. Aerial herbicide treatments produced the highest NPV, BCR, and IRR. Internal rates of return of 4. 32 % for aerial herbicide, 2. 90 % for manual brush cutting, 2. 82 % for ground ap-plied herbicide, and 2. 50 % for brush cutting plus herbicide treatments indicated that all of the vegetation management alternatives evaluated are economically viable...|$|E
40|$|It is {{critical}} for the construction industry to ensure that new building designs and materials, including wall and floor assemblies, provide an acceptable level of fire safety. A key fire safety requirement that is specified in building codes is the minimum fire resistance rating. A manufacturer of building materials (e. g., insulation or drywall) is currently required to perform full-scale fire furnace tests {{in order to determine}} the fire resistance ratings of assemblies that use their products. Due to the cost of these tests, and the limited number of test facilities, it can be difficult to properly assess the impact of changes to individual components on the overall fire performance of an assembly during the design process. It would be advantageous to be able to use small-scale fire tests for this purpose, as these tests are relatively inexpensive to perform. One challenge in using results of small-scale fire tests to predict full-scale fire performance is the difficulty in truly representing a larger product or assembly using a small-scale test specimen. Another challenge is the lack of established methods of scaling fire test results. Cone calorimeter tests were used to measure heat transfer through small-scale specimens that are representative of generic wall assemblies for which fire resistance ratings are given in the National Building Code of Canada. Test specimens had a surface area of 111. 1 mm (4. 375 in.) by 111. 1 mm (4. 375 in.), and consisted of single or double layers of gypsum board, stone wool insulation and <b>spruce-pine-fir</b> (SPR) studs. As the specimens were designed to represent a one-quarter scale model of a common wall design, with studs spaced at a centre-to-centre distance of 406. 4 mm (16 in.), the wood studs were made by cutting nominal 2 x 4 studs (38 mm by 89 mm) into 9. 25 mm by 89 mm (0. 375 in. by 3. 5 in.) pieces. The scaled studs were then spaced at a centre-to-centre distance of 101. 6 mm (4 in.). Three types of gypsum board were tested: 12. 7 mm (0. 5 in.) regular and lightweight gypsum board, and 15. 9 mm (0. 625 in.) type X gypsum board. Temperature measurements were made at various points within the specimens during 70 min exposures to an incident heat flux of 35, 50 and 75 kW/m 2 using 24 AWG Type K thermocouples and an infrared thermometer. Temperature measurements made during cone calorimeter tests were compared with temperature measurements made during fire resistance tests of the same generic assemblies and the result show a very good agreement for the first 25 min of testing at the unexposed side. A one-dimensional conduction heat transfer model was developed using the finite difference method in order to predict temperatures within the small-scale wall assemblies during the cone calorimeter tests. Constant and temperature-dependent thermal properties were used in the model, in order to study the effects of changes to materials and thermal properties on fire performance. A comparison of predicted and measured temperatures during the cone calorimeter tests of the generic wall assemblies is presented in this thesis. The model had varying degrees of success in predicting temperature profiles obtained in the cone calorimeter tests. Predicted and measured times for temperatures to reach 100 C and 250 C on the unexposed side of the gypsum board layer closest to the cone heater were generally within 10 %. There was less agreement between predicted and measured times to reach 600 C at this location, and the temperature increase on the unexposed side of the test specimen. The model did not do a good job in predicting temperatures in the insulated double layer walls. Sensitivity studies show that the thermal conductivity of the gypsum board has the most significant impact on the predicted temperature...|$|E
