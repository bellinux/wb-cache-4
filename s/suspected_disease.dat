40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to present the clinical, {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) and histological data from 27 cats with inflammatory disease of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). The cats were part of a study of 61 cats admitted to two university clinics over an eight-year period because of signs of CNS disease. The most frequent diseases were feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (12 / 27) and <b>suspected</b> viral <b>disease</b> other than FIP (10 / 27). Typical CSF findings in cats with FIP were a protein concentration of greater than 2 g/L (200 mg/dL) and a white cell count of over 100 cells/microL, which consisted predominantly of neutrophils. In contrast, the CSF of cats with <b>suspected</b> viral <b>disease</b> had a protein concentration of less than 1 g/L (100 mg/dL) and a total white cell count of less than 50 cells/microL. In general, cats with FIP or <b>suspected</b> viral <b>disease</b> were less than four years of age. Neurological signs were usually multifocal in cats with FIP, but focal in cats with <b>suspected</b> viral <b>disease.</b> The CSF findings were variable in five other inflammatory diseases represented. Two cats with protozoan infection had normal CSF total cell counts but abnormal differential counts. The CSF findings were invaluable in differentiating FIP from other causes of inflammatory CNS disease...|$|R

We demonstrated that SUVmax and TBmean were effective metrics for this discrimination, while tumor SUVmean and TBmax were not statistically robust discriminators of HGG from LGG.

40|$|AbstractPostoperative {{pelvic pain}} after {{gynecological}} surgery is a readily detected but unspecific sign of complication. Imaging as a complement to physical examination helps establish the etiological diagnosis. In {{the context of}} emergency surgery, vascular, urinary and digestive injuries constitute the most frequent intraoperative complications. During the follow-up of patients who had undergone pelvic surgery, imaging should be performed to detect recurrent disease, postoperative fibrosis, adhesions and more specific complications related to prosthetic material. Current guidelines recommend using pelvic ultrasonography as the first line imaging modality whereas the use of pelvic computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging should be restricted to specific situations, depending on local availability of equipment and <b>suspected</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E

Methods: We enrolled patients with suspected acute heart failure (AHF), sepsis or stroke.

Beat-to-beat HD measurements were averaged for the initial 15 minutes, prior to therapeutic intervention.

The data demonstrated that EEV was circulating as early as 2001 with incidence ranging from 20 - 100 % for time period 2001 - 2008.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{determine}} how well recently developed multivariables scores assess for all-cause mortality {{in patients with}} <b>suspected</b> coronary <b>disease</b> presenting for exercise electrocardiography (ExECG). BackgroundRecently revised American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for ExECG have suggested that ExECG scores be used to assist in management decisions in patients with <b>suspected</b> coronary artery <b>disease.</b> Recently developed scores accurately stratify patients according to angiographic disease severity. MethodsTo {{determine how}} well these scores assess for all-cause mortality, we utilized 4, 640 patients without known coronary disease who underwent ExECG to evaluate symptoms of <b>suspected</b> coronary <b>disease</b> between 1995 and 2001. Previously validated pretest and exercise test scores {{as well as the}} Duke treadmill score were applied to each patient. All-cause mortality was our end point. ResultsOverall mortality was 3. 0 % with 2. 8 ± 1. 6 years of follow-up. All three scores stratified patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups (p < 0. 00001). No differences were seen when patients were evaluated as subgroups according to gender, diabetes, beta-blockers, or inpatient status. Low-risk patients defined by the Duke treadmill score had consistently higher mortality and absolute number of deaths compared with low-risk patients using other scores. In addition, the Duke treadmill score had less incremental stratifying value than the new exercise score. ConclusionsSimple pretest and exercise scores risk-stratified patients with <b>suspected</b> coronary <b>disease</b> in accordance with published guidelines and better than the Duke treadmill score. These results extend to diabetics, inpatients, women, and patients on beta-blockers...|$|R
