2500|$|DOE {{issued its}} Final Environmental impact {{statement}} (EIS) on November 8, 2007, which concluded that all four sites were acceptable from {{an environmental impact}} standpoint and all would move forward in the <b>site</b> <b>evaluation</b> process. [...] EPA published a Notice of Availability (NOA) for the EIS in the Federal Register on November 16, 2007. The DOE is required by federal law to wait at least 30 days after the NOA release before issuing its final Record of Decision (ROD). [...] The waiting period legally closed on December 17, 2007. [...] DOE chose not to issue the ROD and advised the FutureGen Alliance to delay the final site selection announcement, which was scheduled to occur {{at the end of}} the 30-day waiting period. The Alliance chose to move ahead with the announcement, citing time, money, and a commitment to proposers to select the final site by year-end. [...] "Every month of delay can add $10 million to the project's cost, solely due to inflation," [...] said Michael Mudd, the Alliance's chief executive.|$|E

40|$|While {{abundant}} {{ground surface}} and site information {{is included in}} multispectral remote sensing data, traditional <b>site</b> quality <b>evaluation</b> system mainly uses artificial ground surface survey data. To construct an effective <b>site</b> quality <b>evaluation</b> system, this paper, with Wangyedian Forest Farm in Inner Mongolia {{as the object of}} study, has adopted an improved back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) model based on a combination of multispectral remote sensing and surface survey data of the zone.
