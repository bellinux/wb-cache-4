This L3 stage can penetrate through intact skin in as little as 4 hours. Once inside the host, the worms invade the venous circulation and are carried into the lungs, where they become trapped in the capillaries. When the worms mature into the L4 stage they rupture the capillaries and are released into the alveoli where they are coughed up and swallowed. They then reach the small intestines 3-4 days after the initial infection. The worms become adults after the final molt into the L5 stage where they begin laying eggs on the 6th day of infection. The eggs are passed out of the host through feces and the cycle starts all over again.|$|E
40|$|Site preparation, as an {{important}} procedure before afforestation, can affect <b>soil</b> C <b>release.</b> However, the effect of site preparation on <b>soil</b> C <b>release</b> has not been sufficiently investigated. Two site clearing treatments (brush clearing and controlled burning) followed by three soil preparation treatments (overall soil preparation, spot soil preparation, and no soil preparation (control)) were carried out in subtropical China. Soil basal respiration (R-s) and C release of biomass burning were measured as <b>soil</b> C <b>release</b> on an area basis from March 2011 to March 2013. The site preparations changed the <b>soil</b> C <b>release</b> {{in the first year}} but had no effects in the second year. Compared with brush clearing (control), controlled burning (control) significantly increased the annual <b>soil</b> C <b>release</b> (decreased Rs but increased C release of biomass burning) during the first year. Within the brush clearing plots, overall soil preparation significantly increased the Rs rate over eight months and resulted in an increase in annual <b>soil</b> C <b>release</b> during the first year compared to the no soil preparation. In contrast, spot soil preparation increased the Rs rate only for three months and did not affect the annual <b>soil</b> C <b>release</b> during the first year relative to the no soil preparation. In the controlled burning plots, both overall and spot soil preparation increased the Rs rate across six months, but only overall soil preparation caused {{a significant increase in the}} annual <b>soil</b> C <b>release.</b> Our study suggests that minimizing the disturbance of the site preparation would decrease <b>soil</b> C <b>release.</b> Concluding, the spot soil preparation followed brush clearing is a good choice for site preparation in term of soil C storage.

30|$|In this study, the <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> {{performance}} of two <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> finishes were investigated using {{design of experiment}} and factors playing important role in finish performance were studied. Durability of finish and physical properties of selected combinations having excellent <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> performance were also evaluated. Both Oleophobol CPR and CMC-Na finished cotton resulted in excellent <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> rating at various combinations for mustard oil but both showed poor <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> for coffee. Oleophobol CPR also exhibited soil repellent property and required high curing temperature for crosslinking with cotton. It didn’t impart stiffness to the cotton as compared to that with CMC-Na salt finish. Oleophobol CPR showed much better tensile strength retention as compared to that with CMC-NA salt. Both finishes showed better tear strength retention of cotton. TCRA was slightly improved with Oleophobol CPR. Whiteness index was comparatively better in CMC-Na salt finished cotton. Air permeability in both cases was slightly decreased. Durability tests showed that Oleophobol CPR maintained its <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> and repellent properties with multiple (five) soiling tests and had better <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> rating as compared to that with CMC-Na salt.|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at formulating <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> finish {{conditions}} to predict optimum <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> properties {{in terms of its}} <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> rating and K/S value on cotton with two different <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> chemicals viz., Oleophobol CPR and Carboxymethylecellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na salt) using mustard oil and hot coffee as soils. For Oleophobol CPR (a C- 6 type fluorocarbon based product) Box–Behnken design was used in conjunction with response surface analysis and regression methods; for CMC-Na salt full factorial design was used. Finished cotton was evaluated for its visual assessment (<b>soil</b> <b>release</b> rating) as well as instrumental assessment (K/S value) followed by durability of finish. Statistical analysis of both <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> finishes were carried out in order to determine and visualize the relative importance of the factors and also to obtain optimum conditions for finish. Effect on physical properties was also studied and compared.|$|E
30|$|On {{studying}} {{the influence of}} parameters with response surface figures for Oleophobol CPR on <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> rating and K/S value as responses with mustard oil, it was found from Figure  1 (a) that <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> ratings were excellent at all concentrations of (40 - 60 gpl) and at pH  4 - 5. At lower concentrations, e.g. 40 - 48 gpl and at pH  4 - 6, the soil removal performance was comparatively less. Rating increased especially with concentration greater than 48 gpl and at pH  4 - 5. <b>Soil</b> <b>release</b> rating was improved (Figure  1 b) when temperature was simultaneously increased from 150 to 160 °C at a concentration beyond 54 gpl. Lower concentration i.e. 40 to 50 gpl and curing time 3 - 5 minutes showed less effect on <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> rating (Figure  1 c). In all cases maximum <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> rating was seen at pH  4 - 5. When temperature was increased beyond 150 °C and pH was kept around 4 excellent <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> ratings were achieved with the maximum at 154 - 156 °C and pH  4.4 - 4.7 (Figure  1 d). With high curing time of 5  minutes at pH  6 <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> ratings obtained were not maximum but the latter was obtained at pH  4.5 and time[*]>[*] 4.4  minutes (Figure  1 e). <b>Soil</b> <b>release</b> rating was not good even with maximum curing time at curing temperatures of 140 - 150 °C (Figure  1 f); substantial improvement in ratings was achieved at curing time of 4.4  minutes at temperature > 150 °C. From Figures  1 (c, e, f) higher <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> ratings were obtained with curing time of 5  minutes, at concentration > 50 gpl, temperature > 150 °C and pH  4 - 5. Concentration, pH and temperature played significant roles in <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> rating. Therefore, it could be concluded that Oleophobol CPR, only at high concentrations (> 54 gpl) showed maximum <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> ratings at pH  4 - 5, high curing temperatures (150 - 160 °C) and with enough time 4 - 5 minutes.|$|E

30|$|When each {{individual}} treatment group was considered, {{there was an}} interesting finding on the <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> group. The plain woven <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> fabric {{was found to have}} a significantly longer time to second degree burn (4.5  ±  2.1  s) than the twill woven <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> fabric (2.9  ±  1.1  s) (F 3, 95  =  13.27, p ≤  0.001), which was the inverse of the overall effect of fabric type on time to second degree burn. The plain woven <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> fabric also had a significantly lower total absorbed energy for all layers (228.3  ±  15.9  kJ m− 2) than the twill woven <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> fabric (278.2  ±  17.8  kJ m− 2) at the upper sensor (F 3, 96  =  21.94, p ≤  0.001). This significant interaction between fabric type and finish was due to the presence of the <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> finish. Typically the heavier-weight twill-weave fabrics offered better protection against predicted burn injury than plain weave fabrics. The <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> finish fabric was the exception to this trend. <b>Soil</b> <b>release</b> finishes applied to the fabric diffuses water under the soil to help remove this soil during laundering (Kissa 1981). The higher absorbed energy found for the twill weave fabrics {{may be due to the}} nature of the finish as the soil-release finish has the ability to reabsorb and remove soil from the fabric (Kissa 1981). This process of drawing in moisture may be the reason for absorbing more energy. As the twill woven fabrics are heavier and thicker than the plain woven fabrics it is possible that this added effect of absorbing more hot liquid made the twill fabrics store more energy than the plain fabrics.|$|E

30|$|Soiling of {{textiles}} is an irresistible process that deteriorates {{the appearance of}} fabric caused by gradual accumulation of soil on it. Cotton fabrics were finished with {{two different types of}} soil releasing agents, viz.

Finished fabrics were tested for two different soils i.e., mustard oil and hot coffee. From soiled and laundered fabrics <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> was evaluated for <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> rating as well as instrumental prediction with K/S value to measure discolouration of fabric due to soil. The CMC-Na salt finished cotton fabric picked up significantly more soil compared to that with Oleophobol CPR which resisted deposition of soil on fabric. Cotton fabrics finished with both of these showed excellent <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> with mustard oil and had better finish durability with Oleophobol CPR.

40|$|Abstract — Cotton as a {{dominating}} {{natural fibre}} imparts a major contribution {{in the whole}} textile market including natural and artificial fibres. The demand of this cellulosic fibre is increasing rapidly day by day, {{on the other hand}} supply cannot fulfill its demand, and as a result price goes higher in world market. Viscose as cellulosic origin, the cheapest of all cellulosic fibres could be the best alternative. Viscose fibre exhibits some similar properties compared to cotton except its poor wet strength. In this research work different chemical finishes were applied to improve the wet strength of viscose fabric. For this purpose water repellent and <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> finishes were applied. Both water repellent and <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> finishes helped in reducing the molecular barrier around the individual fibres that lowered the surface tension of the fibre. It reduces the absorbency of viscose fibre hence leads to higher wet strength. Water repellent finish was applied alone as well as in combination with <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> finish. It was seen that viscose fibre exhibited better wet strength after applying water repellent and <b>soil</b> <b>release</b> finishes on it. This improved property of viscose could replace the cotton fibre in certain applications like bed linen. Index Term — Cotton, cellulose, viscose, wet strength, wate...|$|E

Cross-correlation analysis indicated a 7 -yr, 5 -yr, and 4 -yr lag time in riverine TN export in response to changes in NANI, temperature, and drained agricultural land area, respectively. Enhanced by warmer temperature and improved agricultural drainage, the upper 20 cm of agricultural <b>soils</b> <b>released</b> 270 kg N ha - 1 between 1980 and 2009.

An empirical model (R 2 = 0. 96) for annual riverine TN flux incorporating these influencing factors estimated 35 %, 41 %, and 24 % of riverine TN flux originated from the soil N pool, NANI, and background N sources, respectively. The model forecasted an increase of 45 %, 25 %, and 6 % and a decrease of 13 % in riverine TN flux from 2010 to 2030 under continued development, climate change, status-quo, and tackling scenarios, respectively.
