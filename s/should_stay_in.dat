5|$|A {{survey of}} American adults {{conducted}} by YouGov in September 2015 found that 56% supported Judge Bunning's decision to jail Davis for contempt of court, while 31% of Americans opposed the decision. When asked what Davis should do, 65% said that Davis should resign from office; 23% said that Davis <b>should</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> office {{and continue to}} refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples; and 4% said that Davis should remain in office but issue licenses to all persons legally entitled to one.|$|E
5|$|Keyes {{supports}} {{an amendment}} to the Constitution barring same-sex marriage. He stated he would not have gone to war in Iraq, but also said that the war was justified and defended President George W. Bush's decision in one of his 2004 debates. Keyes has stated that troops <b>should</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Iraq, but also said that he would have turned over operations to the United Nations. However, Keyes has also stated that even while he was an ambassador there he was not a supporter of the United Nations.|$|E

5|$|When he {{was made}} aware of the new deal, Waylon was not sure if he should quit his gig at JD's. He then went to get the advice of his friend, RCA artist Willie Nelson, who had gone to see one of Waylon's shows. When Willie and Waylon met, after talking about the {{possibilities}} and considering Waylon's profits at the club, Nelson suggested that Waylon <b>should</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Phoenix and not to move to Nashville.|$|E
5|$|Jacques {{joined the}} Quebec Citadelles in 1947. It was while {{playing for the}} Citadelles that Plante started to play the puck outside his crease. He {{developed}} this technique when he recognized that the team's defense was performing poorly. Fans found Plante's unconventional playing style to be exciting, but it angered his managers. They believed that a goaltender <b>should</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> net and let his players recover the puck. Plante {{had come to the}} conclusion that as long as he was in control of the puck, the opponents could not shoot it at him – this is now standard practice for goaltenders. The same season, the Citadelles beat the Montreal Junior Canadiens in the league finals, with Plante being named most valuable player on his team. The Montreal Canadiens' general manager, Frank J. Selke, became interested in acquiring Plante as a member of the team. In 1948, Plante received an invitation to the Canadiens' training camp. On August 17, 1949, Selke offered Plante a contract with the Canadiens' organization. Plante played for Montreal's affiliate Royal Montreal Hockey Club, earning $4,500 for the season, and an extra $500 for practicing with the Canadiens.|$|E
5|$|Smith was a benefactor {{during the}} period of reconstruction. He became {{frustrated}} that, during a time when the Hospital was so clearly in need of financial assistance, the trustees of his Irish munificence were choosing to procrastinate in their remittances of the annual grant. By the mid-1670s he had determined to use the powers granted to him {{under the terms of the}} Royal Charter in order to divert surplus funds from the Trust to the Hospital, and by 1681 relations between Smith and the trustees were so strained that both the governments in London and in Dublin were involved in attempts to determine who had responsibility both for the administration and collection of income and for the distribution thereof. One such involved person was Sir John Temple, the Solicitor-General for Ireland, who asserted that anomalies between the stipulations of 1667 and the Charter of 1669 showed that the revenue <b>should</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Ireland, and also that there was in fact no surplus available in any event because the Trust had not at that time met with all of its responsibilities in Ireland under the terms of the Charter.|$|E

25|$|A Muslim {{woman may}} not {{move in a}} mosque, or perform salat, while she is menstruating or during {{postpartum}} period, because bodily fluids are considered ritually impure in Islam. Some Muslim scholars suggest that the woman <b>should</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> her house, or near her house, during this state. Some Islamic jurists claim {{that this is an}} incorrect interpretation of sharia, and suggest the Islamic intent was about hygiene, not about religious ritual cleanliness.|$|E

25|$|The Electoral Finance Act was {{repealed}} on 17 February 2009 {{by a vote}} in Parliament of 112 to 9.

Justice Minister Simon Power said during debate on the repeal bill that all parties in Parliament had agreed {{to take part in}} consultations to draft replacement electoral law. Until that happens, the 1993 Electoral Act will be in force with clauses of the EFA dealing with donation disclosure inserted.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} {{received}} well by young Austrians in the 1980s. To them, the book represented {{a story of}} truth that was long hidden. At a time when Austria was starting to take on responsibility for its nonaction during World War II, February Shadows threw light on problems of the past. Reichart displayed to her own nation that ignoring and forgetting {{events such as the}} Mühlviertler Hasenjagd was unacceptable and not to be tolerated. Some older Austrians, who had lived through the war, considered February Shadows controversial and inappropriate. Much like the character Hilde, they felt the past <b>should</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the past, that there was a reason for Austrian silence about the events of World War II: to protect lives.|$|E

5000|$|Journalist Michael Barone {{wrote for}} National Review praising Bush for admitting to [...] "serious errors up front".

500|$|The {{trial judge}} {{recommended}} {{that his life}} sentence should mean life, and successive Home Secretaries agreed with that decision. In 1982, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Lane said of Brady: [...] "this is the case if ever {{there is to be}} one when a man <b>should</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> prison till he dies". The death, in November 2007, of John Straffen, who had spent 55 years in prison for murdering three children meant that Brady became the longest serving prisoner in England and Wales.|$|E
500|$|On July 25, Kennedy {{pleaded guilty}} to leaving {{the scene of an}} {{accident}} and was given a sentence of two months in jail, suspended. That night, he gave a national broadcast in which he said, [...] "I regard as indefensible the fact that I did not report the accident to the police immediately," [...] but he denied driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} and also denied any immoral conduct between him and Kopechne. Kennedy asked the Massachusetts electorate whether he <b>should</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> office or resign; after getting a favorable response in messages sent to him, Kennedy announced on July 30 that he would remain in the Senate and run for re-election the next year.|$|E
500|$|Kim Collins, who has {{competed in}} every Games that Saint Kitts and Nevis has participated in, {{was set to}} run the 100 meter dash. Collins {{was not allowed to}} compete by his Olympic {{committee}} after they found out he stayed with his wife, outside of the Olympic village. Collins required to get permission to stay outside the village for multiple nights in a row, and the committee stated he violated team discipline rules. On the issue of not being allowed to compete, Collins said [...] "I feel that I <b>should</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> a hotel with my wife, with or without their permission, that’s the honest to God truth whether they like it or not." [...] He planned to never race for the country again, stating, [...] "This is how it ends, it ends on a really sad note. I should have been allowed to run. I don’t see what is the big deal, I am a grown man, I’m just about to become a grandfather." [...] Collins would later compete in the 2016 Olympics under the same flag.|$|E

500|$|These {{developments}} {{shocked the}} revolutionaries. Unsure {{of what to}} do next, they feared that they would be punished, like the revolutionaries of Chuquisaca and La Paz. Moreno abjured relations with the others and shut himself in his home. There was a meeting at Rodríguez Peña's house. They felt that the Cabildo would not pursue such a plot without the blessing of Saavedra and that Castelli should resign from the Junta. Tagle took a different view: he thought that Saavedra may have accepted out of weakness or naivety and that Castelli <b>should</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the Junta to counter the others' influence on him. Meanwhile, a mob led by Domingo French and Antonio Beruti filled the Plaza. The stability of Cisneros in power, albeit in an office other than Viceroy, was seen as an insult to the will of the open cabildo. Colonel Martín Rodriguez warned that, if the army were to commit support to a government that kept Cisneros, they would soon have to fire on the people, and that they would revolt. He said that [...] "everyone without exception" [...] demanded the removal of Cisneros.|$|E
500|$|Middleton was {{assigned}} {{as an assistant}} inspector general in the army headquarters in Manila. Here he listened to complaints as he travelled to various Army installations including Fort William McKinley and Corregidor. [...] Less than six months into his Philippine tour he received a telegram from President Smith renewing his offer of a job at LSU as the dean of administration with a salary of $5400 per year. Middleton {{was in the hospital}} undergoing testing for some heart irregularity when the telegram arrived, and he showed it to two other lieutenant colonels who were visiting him. One of them said he should take the offer, the salary being excellent. The other lieutenant colonel, Dwight Eisenhower, said he <b>should</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the army. Eisenhower had spent three years in Panama as an aide to General Fox Conner, who knew that the terms of the Treaty of Versailles were being ignored by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, and who was certain another war was coming soon. Eisenhower reasoned that this was no time for an officer with Middleton's combat experience to be getting out of the Army.|$|E
500|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22. The people {{discussed}} if Cisneros <b>should</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> power and, in the case he was removed from office, which type of government should be established. Saavedra stayed silent for the most part, awaiting his turn to speak. The most important speakers were Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, Juan José Castelli, Ruiz Huidobro, Manuel Genaro Villota, Juan José Paso and Juan Nepomuceno de Sola, among others. Saavedra {{was the last one}} to speak, and suggested that the political control should be delegated to the Cabildo until the formation of a governing Junta, in the manner and form that the Cabildo deemed appropriate. In his speech, he pointed out the phrase: [...] "(...) [...] "And there be no doubt that it is the people that confers the authority or command." [...] This statement was in line with the Retroversion of the sovereignty to the people, a political concept formulated by Castelli, stating that {{in the absence of the}} rightful governor the sovereignty returned to the peoples, who had then the power to give it to someone else. Castelli aligned his position with Saavedra's, becoming the common position which was eventually passed with 87 votes.|$|E
