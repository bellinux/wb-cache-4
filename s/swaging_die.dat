5000|$|Changing the rim. While {{this is a}} wildcatting operation, it is {{generally}} only done by commercial operations, due to the precision turning needed. Generally this is a conversion from rimmed to rimless cartridge, or from rimless to rebated, and is done to allow a larger parent case than the firearm action was designed for. The opposite operation, adding a rim to a case, is also generally only done by major manufacturers; examples are the [...]45 Auto Rim, a rimmed [...]45 ACP allowing ejection in [...]45 revolvers {{without the use of}} moon clips, and the [...]307 Winchester, a rimmed [...]308 Winchester, developed for use in lever-action rifles. A handloader can add a rim, by swaging a ring of metal onto a rimless case, then turning it down, but this is very labor-intensive process and requires a special <b>swaging</b> <b>die</b> and precision metalworking lathe. It is far easier for most handloaders to simply start with a rimmed case, either of the desired diameter or reamed out as desired.|$|E

2500|$|In sawmills, a swage is used {{to flare}} large bandsaw or circle saw teeth, which {{increases}} {{the width of the}} cut, called the [...] A clamp attaches a mandrel and die to the tooth and the eccentric <b>die</b> is rotated, <b>swaging</b> the tip. A much earlier version of the same operation used a hardened, shaped <b>swage</b> <b>die</b> and a hand held hammer. Saw teeth formed in this way are sometimes referred to as being [...] "set". A finishing operation, shaping, cold works the points on the tooth sides to flats. It might be considered as a side swage. This slightly reduces the tooth width but increases the operating time between [...] "fittings". Swaging is a major advance over filing as the operation is faster, more precise and greatly extends the working life of a saw.|$|R
40|$|Micro {{rotary swaging}} {{is a cold}} forming process for {{production}} of micro components with determined geometry and surface. It is also possible to change the microstructure of wires and hence the material properties. <b>Swaging</b> <b>dies</b> revolve around the work piece with an overlaid radial oscillation. Newly developed tools (Flat Surface Dies, FSD) feature plain surfaces and do not represent the geometry of the formed part as in conventional swaging. Using these tools allows for producing wires with triangle geometry (cross section) {{as well as a}} circular shape. To test the influence of FSD on material properties by micro swaging a new method is investigated: the variation of the relative speed between the specimen and dies in infeed rotary swaging. During this specific process copper (C 11000) and steel (304  Alloy) wires with diameter d 0 = 1 [*]mm are formed. It is noticed that the mechanical characteristics such as ductility and strength differ from the characteristics after conventional swaging. Moreover this approach enables new possibilities to influence the geometry and the surface quality of wires. The impact of the relative speed on the processed wire features is described in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Rotary swaging is an {{incremental}} bulk metal forming {{process for the}} manufacture of cylindrical lightweight components. Whilst conventional rotary swaging is still carried under the intense use of lubricants to provide desired work piece quality and to avoid forming die wear, recent scientific work focuses {{on the design of}} a dry process layout. Novel functionalized rotary <b>swaging</b> <b>dies</b> were introduced, exhibiting both diamond like carbon (DLC) hard coated and structured surfaces to encounter complex and opposing tribological requirements when dry machining. Such dies were successfully applied to infeed rotary swaging experiments machining steel 1. 0038 and aluminum 3. 3206 tubes. Although primary targets were achieved, the dry rotary swaging process is subject to an increased abrasive particle generation from the work piece material and accumulation of such particles in the forming zone. Abrasive particles provoke a loss of work piece quality and ultimately lead to a clogging of the swaging unit, associated with a significant earlier termination of the forming process. This work presents the investigation of the particle generation when dry rotary swaging with functionalized forming dies in dependence on the work piece material and the process parameter feed velocity. Subsequently, improvements of the die s design are discussed which are to reduce the generation of abrasive particles and conveying the particles from the swaging unit, indispensable for the robust layout of dry rotary swaging processes...|$|R
25|$|All of {{the larger}} {{manufacturers}} of reloading equipment have abandoned making or marketing bullet swaging equipment due to the downturn in {{the popularity of the}} manual methods and the subsequent loss of sales. Currently {{there are only a few}} die makers who manufacture and market bullet <b>swaging</b> equipment. Four <b>die</b> and equipment makers, CH/4D, RCE, Corbin, and Custom Maker Kaine Dies, manufacture the bulk of bullet swaging equipment in the United States.|$|R
40|$|The {{abrasive}} flow machining (AFM) {{is a new}} {{finishing operation}} that involves abrasive particles as the tool to remove work material. AFM is broadly known as “no-tool” precision finishing operation and the carrier media containing abrasive particles is called as “self-deformable stone”. In AFM, a semi-solid polymer-based media containing abrasive powders in a particular proportion is flown through the work-piece at a certain pressure. The AFM consists of three major components, i. e. machine, media and tooling or fixture. The machine consists of a frame structure, control system, hydraulic cylinder and the media cylinder. The extrusion pressure for a standard AFM process varies from 10 bars to 100 - 200 bars. The function of tooling and fixture is to position the work-piece and provide direction to the media flow through the work-piece. The media consists of a carrier, abrasive powder and some additives. The flow of the media can be modeled using finite volume method as it deals with flow of a fluid. In the present work, FLUID FLOW FLUENT available in ANSYS 15 software package {{was used for the}} modeling and simulation. A 2 D model for a cylindrical work-piece and a 3 D model for four rotary <b>swaging</b> <b>dies</b> along with the fixtures have been prepared. Validation has been done for the two models with the existing experimental data. The most affecting flow output parameters like dynamic pressure, velocity and strain rate for different volume fraction and media speed have been analysed. The 3 D model was simulated for both the non-granular and granular flow. The effects of different abrasive particles for variable diameter and volume fraction on the flow output parameters like granular pressure and skin friction coefficient have been studied. The flow analysis of the outputs gives a prediction of material removal efficiency...|$|R
5000|$|Primer pocket swages can {{be either}} standalone, bench-mounted, {{specialized}} presses, or, alternatively, a special <b>swage</b> anvil <b>die</b> that can be mounted into a standard [...] "O" [...] style reloading press, along with a special shell holder insert with either a large or a small primer pocket insert swage that is then inserted into the position on the [...] "O" [...] press where a normal shell holder is usually clicked into position. This way, both small and large primer pockets on different types of military cases can be properly processed to remove primer pocket crimps. Both types of presses {{can be used to}} remove either ring crimps or stab crimps found on military cartridges when reloading them. Reamers for removing primer pocket crimps are not associated with presses, being an alternative to using a press to remove military case primer pocket crimps.|$|R
