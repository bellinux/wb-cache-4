5|$|Ground-based radio {{images taken}} using the VLA {{revealed}} seven radio <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> the HDF, {{all of which}} correspond to galaxies visible in the optical images. The field has also been surveyed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the MERLIN array of radio telescopes at 1.4GHz; the combination of VLA and MERLIN maps made at wavelengths of 3.5 and 20cm have located 16 radio <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> the HDF-N field, with many more in the flanking fields. Radio images of some individual <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> the field have been made with the European VLBI Network at 1.6GHz with a higher resolution than the Hubble maps.|$|E

50|$|Source transformations {{are easy}} to compute using Ohm's law. If there is a voltage <b>source</b> <b>in</b> series with an impedance, it is {{possible}} to find the value of the equivalent current <b>source</b> <b>in</b> parallel with the impedance by dividing the value of the voltage source by the value of the impedance. The converse also holds: if a current <b>source</b> <b>in</b> parallel with an impedance is present, multiplying the value of the current source with the value of the impedance provides the equivalent voltage <b>source</b> <b>in</b> series with the impedance. A visual example of a source transformation can be seen in Figure 1.|$|R

5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> the scene.|$|E

5|$|After 1900, the {{financial}} and official records from Henry's reign began to become accessible to historians, including the pipe rolls, court records, correspondence and records of administration of the royal forests. Thomas Tout made extensive use of these new <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> the 1920s, and post-war historians brought a particular focus on the finances of Henry's government, highlighting his fiscal difficulties. This wave of research culminated in Sir Maurice Powicke's two major biographical works on Henry, published in 1948 and 1953, which formed the established history of the King {{for the next three}} decades.|$|E

5|$|Detractors {{have raised}} {{concerns}} over Lichtenstein's appropriation, {{in that he}} directly references imagery from other <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> Whaam! and other works of the period.

In response to claims of plagiarism, the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation has noted that publishers have never sued for copyright infringement, and that they never raised the issue when Lichtenstein's comics-derived work first gained attention in the 1960s. Other criticism centers on Lichtenstein's failure to credit the original artists of his sources; Ernesto Priego implicates National Periodicals {{in the case of}} Whaam!, as the artists were never credited in the original comic books.|$|E
