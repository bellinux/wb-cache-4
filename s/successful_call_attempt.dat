In order to optimize call scheduling, {{it is important to have}} both a flexible call scheduler that can utilize multiple parameters for prioritizing and delivering cases, as well as sufficient data to illustrate when sample members are at home and can be contacted. This paper builds on prior discussions of call schedulers by detailing key features of call schedulers and linking these features to call outcomes. In addition, this paper expands prior discussions of optimal call scheduling which have typically limited their review to one study by presenting an analysis of both <b>successful</b> <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> and refusal conversion for different types of samples (list versus RDD), waves of data collection (baseline versus follow-up), and populations (e. g., youth, adults over 18, and workers) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> in a {{telephone}} survey is an important decision. A large number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> makes the data collection costly and time-consuming; and {{a small number of}} attempts decreases the response set from which conclusions are drawn and increases the variance. The decision can also {{have an effect on the}} nonresponse bias. In this paper we study the effects of number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> on the nonresponse rate and the nonresponse bias in two surveys conducted by Statistics Sweden: The Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Household Finances (HF). By use of paradata we calculate the response rate as a function of the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> To estimate the nonresponse bias we use estimates of some register variables, where observations are available for both respondents and nonrespondents. We also calculate estimates of some real survey parameters as functions of varying number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> The results indicate that it is possible to reduce the current number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> without getting an increased nonresponse bias...|$|R
40|$|In {{telephone}} surveys, several <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> {{are often}} needed {{to establish contact}} with selected individuals. We consider the problem of choosing {{the maximum number of}} <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> to be made to each selected individual before he or she is classified as unavailable. This is an important question since a large number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> makes the data collection costly and time-consuming; a small number of attempts decreases the response set from which conclusions are drawn. We start from the assumptions that the survey goal is to estimate a population total, that the sample can be divided into response homogeneity groups, and that the direct weighting estimator is to be used. We suggest a strategy for choosing the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> that takes the survey design, non-response, measurement errors and costs of data collection into account. The strategy relies on models for non-response and measurement errors. In our models, the impact of the error sources on the estimator may differ for different numbers of <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> According to our strategy, the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> is decided through a comparison of the estimator’s standard error for different numbers of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> but the same cost. Next we study the case when the response homogeneity groups do not work properly but there remains a non-response bias. Our solution relies on models for many different survey errors (the sampling error...|$|R

50|$|Where the {{existing}} busy-hour carried traffic, Ec, is measured on an already-overloaded system, {{with a significant}} level of blocking, {{it is necessary to}} take account of the blocked calls in estimating the busy-hour offered traffic Eo (which is the traffic value {{to be used in the}} Erlang formula). The offered traffic can be estimated by Eo = Ec/(1 &minus; Pb). For this purpose, where the system includes a means of counting blocked <b>calls</b> and <b>successful</b> <b>calls,</b> Pb can be estimated directly from the proportion of calls that are blocked. Failing that, Pb can be estimated by using Ec in place of Eo in the Erlang formula and the resulting estimate of Pb can then be used in Eo = Ec/(1 &minus; Pb) to estimate Eo. Another method of estimating Eo in an overloaded system is to measure the busy-hour call arrival rate, λ (counting <b>successful</b> <b>calls</b> and blocked calls), and the average call-holding time (for <b>successful</b> <b>calls),</b> h, and then estimate Eo using the formula E = λh.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of the spectral resources and mobility of the portables, the <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> may be blocked during call initiation or terminated during the hand-off process. When the blocking ratio exceeds some grade of service level, {{the capacity of the}} congested cell must be replanned using the <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> data. However, most of the time, the measurements are inflated by the redials and the retrials. During the replanning process, the first step should be to calculate the effective load from the measured cumulative call statistics. In this paper, we provide simpleto-implement analytical models that compute the average number of retrials and redials per original <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> using only the operations and maintenance center (OMC) measurements. The effective load is then determined through appropriate scaling. That way, unnecessary waste of channels to sustain retrials and redials is avoided during the cellular capacity replanning phase...|$|R

40|$|Introduction We {{consider}} {{the suitability of}} Lotos for modelling and analysing an online feature manager. The work forms {{part of a larger}} project on hybrid methods for feature interaction detection and resolution. In modern telecommunications networks features such as Waiting" (a subscriber is informed when a <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> is made to an busy line) or Ringing" (where a number of telephones reacts to an incoming <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> and the <b>call</b> can be answered at any phone) are common. The number of features is steadily increasing. Further, a general move towards an open market leads to more suppliers of features. Features are added functionality, they are developed independent of each other and are tested. However, making features available together introduces the potential for interaction between them: two features might react to the same trigger (for example a <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> to a busy line) and oer dierent ways of handling this.

The tools used to perform the statistical analysis have been previously used in similar works and are extremely simple. First, probability density functions are fitted to the channel idle time (time {{between the end of}} a message {{and the beginning of the}} next one on the same channel). To characterise the population that generates the offered traffic it is more important the time between <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> This is a difficult measure as it needs to be induced from other measures: attempts are not seen when they really occur, but when the system allocates a radio-channel to them. Two methods to obtain the coefficient of variation of the time between <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> are presented. Based on the proposed procedures we show that in our system the infinite population assumption is far from the true situation. The measures presented in this paper show that the time between <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> follows a probabil [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The general {{decrease}} in telephone survey response rates leads to potential selection and estimation biases. As nonrespondents {{can be broken}} down into noncontacts and refusals, different strategies can be deployed—increasing the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> before aban-doning a number, and calling back refusals/abandonments to persuade them to participate. Using a two-stage random-digit-dialing sample of 8, 645 individuals aged 15 – 49 for a survey on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), we compared the effects of the two strategies: includ-ing hard-to-contact respondents (more than twenty <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> with no upper limit) and including respondents from two successive waves of call-back among initial refusals/abandonments.

50|$|Many factors {{affect the}} quality of service of a mobile network. It is correct to look at QoS mainly from the customer's point of view, that is, QoS as judged by the user. There are {{standard}} metrics of QoS to the user that can be measured to rate the QoS. These metrics are: the coverage, accessibility (includes GoS), and the audio quality. In coverage the strength of the signal is measured using test equipment and this can be used to estimate the size of the cell. Accessibility is about determining the ability of the network to handle <b>successful</b> <b>calls</b> from mobile-to-fixed networks and from mobile-to-mobile networks. The audio quality considers monitoring a <b>successful</b> <b>call</b> {{for a period of time}} for the clarity of the communication channel.
