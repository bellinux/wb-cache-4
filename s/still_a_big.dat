25|$|Cycloalkanes {{reported}} as LOHC include cyclohexane, methyl-cyclohexane and decalin. The dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes is highly endothermic (63-69 kJ/mol H2), which means this process requires high temperature. Dehydrogenation of decalin {{is the most}} thermodynamically favored among the three cycloalkanes, and methyl-cyclohexane is second {{because of the presence}} of the methyl group. Research on catalyst development for dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes has been carried out for decades. Nickel (Ni), Molybdenum (Mo) and Platinum (Pt) based catalysts are highly investigated for dehydrogenation. However, coking is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> challenge for catalyst’s long-term stability.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} major tournament he had led England into. They lost the first game against the West Indies, and looked to be heading for defeat against South Africa, but Jason Roy and Joe Root ensured they chased down 230 for victory. It looked like a {{collapse}} would be on the cards against Afghanistan, but Moeen Ali and David Willey lead the recovery to help England to a 15 run victory. After beating Sri Lanka, England qualified for the semi-finals against New Zealand. Good death bowling from David Willey and Chris Jordan saw England restrict their opponents to 153–8, and they {{went on to win the}} match by seven wickets. England lost the final after Ben Stokes was hit for four consecutive sixes, although it was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> improvement from England and their exciting brand of cricket was generally praised.|$|E

500|$|In October 2014, {{in terms}} of Phase Four films, Feige said, for the time being, [...] "We're {{not going to talk}} {{specifically}} about the story of any of those films, the plot of any of those films, what happens to any of the characters in any of those films. In fact, even to talk about any of those characters – who will be involved in those movies – will {{be a bit of a}} spoiler as to what may or may not happen to them in earlier movies." [...] In April 2016, Feige added, [...] "We're only working on what’s been announced through the end of 2019. And it is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> chess board for 2020 and beyond". A year later, Feige noted, [...] "We have an idea , and it's gonna be very, very different," [...] but cautioned that Marvel would not be [...] "actively discussing anything past untitled Avengers" [...] besides dating the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming and that James Gunn would be working on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. He also was not sure if Marvel would continue to group the films in phases once Phase Three concluded, that [...] "it might be a new thing." [...] A second sequel to Homecoming is also planned.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the whole second season, Goldman wrote that [...] "Their was [...] some {{complaints}} that the season finale was a bit too rushed, with a lot of information offered all at once. Yet while that's a bit valid, it's also an exciting and surprising finale, that actually offers some bigger shocks than season 1." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a mostly positive review, praising the reveal of Beaver as the murderer while being slightly critical of his reveal as Veronica's rapist. He wrote that [...] "as twists go, this was a good one" [...] and that [...] "Kyle Gallner makes the transition from goofy, kind of pathetic little brother to insane mastermind quite well—the circles under his eyes, specifically, which seemed to indicate anxiety before suddenly indicated darkness and insanity when seen in a new light." [...] Regarding the rape reveal, the reviewers wrote that [...] "On a narrative level, I was fine with it...it's <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> problem in an emotional sense. In general, rape is a difficult subject, and to see it used as a plot device creates problems on its own." [...] Kaiser summed up his review by writing, [...] "'Not Pictured' acts as an effective capstone for a chaotic season. Sure, it doesn't entirely work, but overall, it gets the job done with emotion and flair." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, {{following}} speculation as {{to which}} label From Autumn to Ashes would release their next record, the band signed to Vagrant Records and enlisted Garth [...] "GGGarth" [...] Richardson as producer. After performing on the 2003 Warped Tour, they released their second full-length album, The Fiction We Live on September 9, 2003, which again featured vocals from Melanie Wills on the song [...] "Autumn's Monologue". The album was described as more melodic in sound than Too Bad You're Beautiful, which had a more [...] "hardcore sound." [...] Perri explained that The Fiction We Lives songs had more structure than their debut release, and {{was the result of}} the band's time together. Aubin Paul of Punk News viewed the release as a growth from Too Bad You're Beautiful, writing that [...] "like their previous , [...] contains its share of PSAT words, and overtly maudlin pseudo-poetry, but it's <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> improvement". The move to a larger label and slightly more commercialized sound allowed the band to find more mainstream success, producing three singles, [...] "The After Dinner Payback", [...] "Lilacs & Lolita" [...] and [...] "Milligram Smile". The song [...] "The After Dinner Payback" [...] also appeared on the soundtrack for the horror film Freddy vs. Jason. For the following months, the group toured the country, also playing on the 2004 Warped Tour, during which time Josh Newton (bass) joined, as Pilato left along with Gross.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1960s, however, Fleetwood {{began to}} decline economically. The last ferry to the Isle of Man sailed in 1961. The sailings have been revived {{periodically}} since. The main railway station was closed in 1966 {{as a result of}} the Beeching cuts, and the passenger terminus was moved to Wyre Dock railway station. This in turn was closed in 1970, as the branch line from Poulton was taken out of service. Additional light industry developed along the former railway bed. The rise of package holidays abroad led to fewer visitors generally to British resort towns. As Blackpool expanded its attractions, fewer day visitors came to Fleetwood, and as transport became more efficient, more overnight visitors became day visitors. The Hillhouse plant was heavily cut back, and was finally closed in 1999. Most serious, however, was the collapse of the fishing industry, which was largely destroyed in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the Cod Wars, a dispute over fishing rights between Iceland and the UK. As Fleetwood's trawlers mainly fished the North Atlantic in search of cod, the loss of the fishing grounds hit the town hard. The last deep sea trawler left the town in 1982 and now only inshore fishing boats fish out of the port, although trawlers registered in other places can still be seen taking advantage of the fish market. Fish is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> industry in the town, though the jobs are mainly in processing rather than fishing. A pair of bronze [...] on the promenade by the pier depicts the idea of families welcoming back the fishermen from sea.|$|E
