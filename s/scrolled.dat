5|$|The game {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} perspective, and the screen, which {{does not need to}} remain centered on the protagonist, can be <b>scrolled</b> with the mouse or the keyboard. Areas are revealed as they are explored by the player's characters. A fog of war effect hides explored areas when the player's characters move away from them. The player can also change the formation in which the party moves. Clicking an area exit, such as a doorway or staircase, causes another area to be loaded. Clicking on the edge of an outside area causes the party to travel there; the game then presents the player with the World Map, from which the player may select a destination.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, while Miller and Colmesnil {{were busy}} with their {{entry in the}} {{competition}} to redesign San Francisco City Hall {{as well as with}} the design of many new hotels, apartments and private homes, Timothy L. Pflueger was given the opportunity to serve as chief architect on a rural church project funded by The Family, a club to which Miller belonged. Pflueger designed Our Lady of the Wayside Church with a main theme of Spanish Mission Revival based on his childhood familiarity with Mission San Francisco de Asís (locally known as Mission Dolores) but added his own personal statement: a striking Georgian main entrance topped by a <b>scrolled</b> pediment. After working with sub-contractor members of The Family on the project, Pflueger joined the club himself. The rural church was declared California Historical Landmark number 909 in 1977.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Peter McConnell, Michael Land and Clint Bajakian. The three had {{worked together to}} share the duties equally of composing the music for Monkey Island 2 and Fate of Atlantis, and continued this approach for Day of the Tentacle. According to McConnell, he had composed most of the music {{taking place in the}} game's present, Land for the future, and Bajakian for the past, outside of Dr. Fred's theme for the past which McConnell had done. The music was composed around the cartoonist nature of the game play, further drawing on Looney Tunes' use of parodying classical works of music, and playing on set themes for all of the major characters in the game. Many of these themes had to be composed to take into account different processing speeds of computers at the time, managed by the iMUSE music interface; such themes would include shorter repeating patterns that would play while the game's screen <b>scrolled</b> across, and then once the screen was at the proper place, the music would continue on to a more dramatic phrase.|$|E
5|$|Although English {{furniture}} derives so extensively {{from foreign}} and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case {{down to the}} end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were <b>scrolled,</b> the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with Charles II, and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of William III and Mary II these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped splat and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. George Hepplewhite, Thomas Sheraton and Robert Adam all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of Thomas Chippendale, remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight.|$|E

40|$|<b>Scroll</b> profile plays a {{key role}} in {{determining}} the performance of a <b>scroll</b> compressor. In this study geometric and dynamic characteristics of the <b>scroll</b> profile are analyzed to investigate the influence of its geometric continuity on property of a <b>scroll</b> compressor. Firstly, <b>scroll</b> profiles are created to redesign the geometry of <b>scroll</b> wrap by using the equidistant-curve approach on the basis of a generation line consisting of involute of circle and circular arc. Subsequently, the geometric and dynamic models of the <b>scroll</b> compressor are established. These models are related to parameters of the generation line of <b>scroll</b> profile and rotation angle of a moving <b>scroll.</b> Lastly, some simulation examples of second-order continuity (SOC) <b>scroll</b> profile are compared with first-order continuity (FOC) <b>scroll</b> profiles and some important conclusions are obtained. Results show that SOC <b>scroll</b> profile is superior to FOC profile in terms of volume ratio, stability of gas force, and possible leakage loss in a <b>scroll</b> compressor...|$|R

40|$|Flick <b>scrolling</b> is {{a natural}} <b>scrolling</b> method for mobile touch devices such as the iPhoneTM. It is useful {{not only for its}} {{performance}} but perhaps even more so for its ease of use and user experience. Tilt <b>scrolling</b> instead uses the device’s tilt to determine the rate of <b>scrolling,</b> which offers several potential interaction advantages over touch sensitive alterna-tives: <b>scrolling</b> can be achieved without occluding {{a large proportion of the}} screen with a hand, finger, or thumb; it frees drag input events for other important actions such as text selection and drag-and-drop; and it works regardless of the hand’s state (e. g. moist or gloved). Although previously described, the performance of tilt <b>scrolling</b> has not been com-pared to flick <b>scrolling,</b> which is now the state of the art. Furthermore, it is unclear how such an empirical compari-son should be conducted. To better understand interaction with mobile <b>scrolling,</b> we propose a new method of evaluat-ing <b>scrolling</b> interfaces in the context of reading or analysis tasks. These activities typically involve slow subtle <b>scroll</b> movements rather than large movements typical investigated in most <b>scrolling</b> evaluations. We use this method to thor-oughly compare flick <b>scrolling</b> and tilt <b>scrolling.</b> We show that tilt <b>scrolling</b> results in better performance for tasks per-formed while stationary while there is no significant differ-ence while moving.

A few <b>scroll</b> wheels can also be tilted, <b>scrolling</b> horizontally in one direction until released.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>scroll</b> {{compressor}} has the conjugate {{motion of}} meshing by the fixed <b>scroll</b> {{and the planet}} <b>scroll.</b> Several kinds of geometrical curves can be adopted to form the <b>scroll</b> compressor profile such as involute of circle with variable and constant radius, algebraic spiral, and so on, to improve the performance of <b>scroll</b> compressor. This study proposes a new <b>scroll</b> profile design using elliptic involute and two-envelope method {{to create a new}} conjugate meshing <b>scroll</b> of variable cross section. The curve of the <b>scroll</b> section on both sides can be specified as an arbitrary mathematical function. First, the base <b>scroll</b> swept out by the central base circle. Next, the base circle translation path envelope of the planet <b>scroll</b> is moved by the basic involute curve. The base circle translation path envelope is the first envelope. The second envelope generated by the planet <b>scroll</b> conjugate profile is the fixed <b>scroll.</b> By using two-envelope method, the variety of conjugate <b>scroll</b> can be produce with the cross section and symmetrical variables for parametric design...|$|R

25|$|On {{the stock}} Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), {{as well as}} on most 8-bit arcade hardware, {{platform}} games generally only scroll in one direction at a time, usually horizontally. This means designers must use a very narrow level progression, or break levels up into subareas that <b>scrolled</b> either horizontally or vertically, {{as was the case in}} Metroid and Mega Man — or effectively upgrade the system using memory management controller chips, embedded into each relevant cartridge. One of the first platform games to scroll in all four directions freely and follow the on-screen character's movement is in a vector game called Major Havoc, which comprises a number of mini-games, including a simple platformer, a shoot 'em up sequence, a landing sequence, and a Breakout clone. One of the first raster-based platform games to scroll fluidly in all directions in this manner is the previously mentioned 1984 classic, Legend of Kage.|$|E
