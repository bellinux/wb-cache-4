40|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) in 1999, the EU aimed to tackle challenges in the field of security by deploying various police and military missions in troubled crisis areas. The consolidation of the CSDP raised hopes for the EU’s role in external affairs. However, the majority of CSDP missions are still on a small scale. Strategic disagreements among EU partners persist on issues of UN legality, NATOneutrality and the geographic deployment of missions. This lack of consensus is {{due to a lack of}} common ideas, values and practices regarding the use of police and military force in Europe. In short: there is no common strategic culture. This paper analyses some of the major provisions of the Lisbon Treaty that impact upon the CSDP. It argues that although some of these provisions <b>sound</b> <b>positive</b> on paper, they will not necessarily enhance the development of a common strategic culture. And without the consolidation of such a culture, the CSDP cannot deliver ambitious results. A strong commitment to invest in capabilities and the political will to assume more responsibility in the field of security are necessary prerequisites for further progress in the CSDP...|$|E
40|$|Learning to read is essential, {{yet many}} {{children}} do not receive a diagnosis of developmental dyslexia (DD) until second or third grade. The aim of this dissertation is to identify brain and behavioral predictors of DD so that diagnosis and intervention can begin sooner. Experiment 1 examines infants with familial risk of DD longitudinally. Infants completed non-sedated diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) between 4 - and 18 -months of age and cognitive-linguistic assessment at four years. Infants at- risk of DD displayed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased radial diffusivity (RD) in the left arcuate fasciculus (AF) and reduced FA and axial diffusivity (AD) of the splenium of the corpus callosum (CC) compared to peers without a familial risk. Both the left AF and CC are implicated in reading and reading-related tasks, and atypicalities have been observed in children and adults with DD. RD may reflect myelination and AD is thought to indicate pathway complexity suggesting infants at-risk of DD exhibit reduced myelination of the left AF and reduced pathway complexity of the CC at or shortly after birth. The left AF assessed in infancy predicted four-year-old vocabulary skills while the CC predicted four-year-old print knowledge. Experiment 2 explores the association between white matter microstructure of the left AF and CC and neural activity during phonological processing assessed via {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Preschoolers with and without a familial risk of DD completed DWI and an fMRI alliteration task where children indicated via button-press whether two words started with the same initial <b>sound.</b> <b>Positive</b> correlations were observed between FA of the left AF and CC and neural activity in the left medial temporal gyrus and the left lingual gyrus, two regions implicated in phonological processing. Experiment 3 examines whether white matter microstructure of the CC assessed in preschool is associated with school-age reading fluency in children with and without a familial risk of DD. Similar to children and adults with DD, preschoolers with a familial risk of DD displayed greater FA and AD of the CC compared to controls. Furthermore, AD of the CC predicted school-age reading fluency. 2018 - 12 - 03 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E
40|$|The core {{topic of}} the 11 th Hands-on Science Conference is "Science Education with and for Society"As {{we all know it}} is the Society that sets the {{requirements}} rules and procedures of Education. It is Society that defines what citizens must learn in what concern either concepts and or competencies, and how this learning can, must in fact…, take place. Society is the ensemble of all of us citizens and of all the structures tangible and intangible we create and created along the years of our common history as a people, as a nation, as humankind. Educational policies set by governments, elected and or imposed, not always reflects the will and ruling of Society. In difficult times of, apparent, civilizational regression and clear disrespect of people’s citizens’ and human’ rights, as the ones we are facing in the beginning of this new millennium, Education can and should have a decisive corrective role. The School as pivotal element of our modern educational system must look behind and beyond imposed rules and regulations and persistently seek a permanent and open relation with Society, in all its dimensions, assuming and defending its crucial role on the development of Society and humankind. The decisive importance of Science {{to the development of the}} Society awards Science Education and Science & Technology Education a role of special impact. The aim of the Hands-on Science Network was set right from the beginning to “contribute to the generalization innovation and improvement of Science & Technology Education at basic vocational training and secondary schools by hands-on experimental investigative practice in the classroom [...] . bringing hands-on active learning of Science into the classroom and into the soul and spirit of the School [...] . ” with a broad open understanding of the meaning and importance of Science to the development of our societies, each individual and of the humankind. Open to all pedagogic approaches that may contribute to the effective implementation of a sound widespread scientific literacy and effective Science Education in our Schools and Society at large, we advise the employment of open and flexible strategies to lead our students and fellow citizens to learn about Science in a committed active and investigative hands-on experiments based way, connected with everyday life and to Society,… feeling the thrill of discovering and understanding the world we leave in.

40|$|Lexical {{knowledge}} influences {{how human}} listeners {{make decisions about}} speech <b>sounds.</b> <b>Positive</b> lexical effects (faster responses to target sounds in words than in nonwords) are robust across several laboratory tasks, while negative effects (slower responses to targets in more word-like nonwords than in less word-like nonwords) {{have been found in}} phonetic decision tasks but not phoneme monitoring tasks. The present experiments tested whether negative lexical effects are therefore a task-specific consequence of the forced choice required in phonetic decision. We compared phoneme monitoring and phonetic decision performance using the same Dutch materials in each task. In both experiments there were positive lexical effects, but no negative lexical effects. We observe that in all studies showing negative lexical effects, the materials were made by cross-splicing, which meant that they contained perceptual evidence supporting the lexically-consistent phonemes. Lexical knowledge seems to influence phonemic decision-making only when there is evidence for the lexically-consistent phoneme in the speech signal...|$|R

40|$|People who use {{in their}} {{professionals}} are defined as “Professional Voice Users”. Whereas voice disorders do not hinder {{those who do not}} use their voices in their professional lives; however, it does hinder the continuity the professional lives of thosewho do. The professional speakers who are to have voice education are first of all to be aware of their speech organs and their functions. Moreover, they have to be aware how the sounds are produced by the movements of the speech organs and be aware and pay attention to all the issues related to correct and beautiful speech or voicing (Alçın, 1999). The professional features of a professional whose duty is to speak, in other words of the speaker, newsman, necessitate him tobe more skilled and more able than just any speaker (Kayador, 1993 : 26). The sounds of speech are studied under two headings; voiced and voiceless. Whereas the utterances of the voiced sounds are labeled as pronunciation, the utterance of the voiceless are defined as articulation. In both instances the effect of respiration are of utmost importance. If we aim to have a good voice and use our language correctly and beautifully, to learn conscious respiration is of primary importance. Those who breathe in, breathe out, and use their breath during their speech consciously will face fewer difficulties throughout the time after their voice education (Çevik, 2002). Besides all these, the enrichment of the voice through the increase in the resonance spaces enables it placement on to the masque. The resonance area that we always need and can process is at the highest level possible in the cheeks, eyes and forehead. With the correct articulation including the resonance of the <b>sound,</b> <b>positive</b> results can be obtained in the increase of the voice quality. “Articulation is the basic condition of meaningful voicing. Without an efficient articulation, speech is meaningless. Even if an utterance is at a high pitch, unless the articulation is insufficient, words will be meaningless and speech futile” (Özben, 1989 : 43). Major articulation errors are; laxity, guttural, hissing, alteration, fixation, slow and fast paced articulation. Voice disorders; however are considered as disorders related to volume, pitch, tone, and flexibility. The aim of voice education at large is; to make them use their voice while speaking or singing in their way of living in the most correct, beautiful, and efficient way and to enable individuals to form habits for the protection of their voices. The individuals who require voice education to use their voices professionally in order to become speakers and newsman need to be determined whether or not they have adequate respiration, correctarticulation, and qualified voice formation {{as a result of the}} voice education they have had.. The present study is important as it is a novel study in this area trying to determine the effects of voice education methods on the articulation and correction of voice disorders in speaker education. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of voice training on the correction of voice disorders and articulation of the individuals receiving education in order to use their voices professionally. 16 students receiving education to become professional speaker with articulation and/or voice disorders were divided into two cohorts consisting of 8 participants as thecontrol and experimental group in the present study conducted according to pre and post test experimental study model. Voice education was provided throughout a 10 week period to the members of the experimental group. At the end of this period the assessments made for both groups were repeated. The pre and post test evaluations were made using camera recordings by three experts. The data obtained before and after the study from the study and control groups were analyzed statistically. The analyses revealed no statistically significant differences before and after the study regarding the acoustic and aerodynamic measurementdata with regard to Fo (Fundamental Frequency), Jitter, Shimmer, NHR (Noice Harmonic Ratio), MFS (Maximum Phonation Period), and S/Z ratio in both groups. However, considering the data obtained from articulation and voice disorder evaluation forms, there were no changes before and after the study in the control group but significant changes were apparent in the experimental group with regard to (/r/(guttural), /s/ (hissing), /sh/, /dz/, /t∫/, /z/, quick articulation, slow articulation, emphasis disorder, pitch disorder, tone disorders (gargling voice and guttural voice). These outcomes enables the assumption that voice education have an impact on the improvement of articulation and voice disorders...|$|E
