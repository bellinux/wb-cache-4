50|$|<b>Subpart</b> <b>A,</b> or more {{commonly}} known as the “Common Rule”, of the 45 C.F.R. 46 is the fundamental guidelines for ethics of all human research. Any establishment that wants to do research involving humans must submit a document that states they will comply with this policy and all pertinent policies to the federal department or agency with authority. The IRB must initially review and approve the research and in the case the study is approved, the IRB will then continue to monitor the research. If at any point the research does not follow the guidelines approved by the IRB, then the IRB has the authority to suspend or terminate the research. The department or agency in charge also has the power to suspend the research. During the course of the study, the IRB must document all meetings and activities.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{existence}} of a small partition of a combinatorial structure into random-like <b>subparts,</b> <b>a</b> so-called regular partition, {{has proven to be}} very useful in the study of extremal problems, and has deep algorithmic consequences. The main result in this direction is the Szemerédi Regularity Lemma in graph theory. In this note, we are concerned with regularity in permutations: we show that every permutation of a sufficiently large set has a regular partition into a small number of intervals. This refines the partition given by Cooper (2006) [10], which required an additional non-interval exceptional class. We also introduce a distance between permutations that plays an important rôle in the study of convergence of a permutation sequence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{a recent}} paper Baumann [1] {{has shown that}} {{splitting}} re-sults, similar to those known for logic programs under answer set se-mantics and default logic, can also be obtained for Dung argumentation frameworks (AFs). Under certain conditions a given AF A can be split into <b>subparts</b> <b>A</b> 1 and A 2 such that extensions of A can be computed by (1) computing an extension E 1 of A 1, (2) modifying A 2 based on E 1, and (3) combining E 1 and an extension E 2 of the modified variant of A 2. In this paper we perform a systematic empirical evaluation of the ef-fects of splitting on the computation of extensions.

40|$|In June of this year, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued {{directives}} DOE O 414. 1 C and DOE G 414. 1 - 4 {{to improve}} quality assurance programs, processes, and procedures among its safety contractors. Specifically, guidance entitled, ''Safety Software Guide {{for use with}} 10 CFR 830 <b>Subpart</b> <b>A,</b> Quality Assurance Requirements, and DOE O 414. 1 C, Quality Assurance, DOE G 414. 1 - 4 '', provides information and acceptable methods to comply with safety software quality assurance (SQA) requirements. The guidance provides a roadmap for meeting DOE O 414. 1 C, ''Quality Assurance'', and the quality assurance program (QAP) requirements of Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 830, <b>Subpart</b> <b>A,</b> Quality Assurance, for DOE nuclear facilities and software application activities. [1, 2] The order and guide {{are part of a}} comprehensive implementation plan that addresses issues and concerns documented in Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) Recommendation 2002 - 1. [3] Safety SQA requirements for DOE as well as National Nuclear Security Administration contractors are necessary to implement effective quality assurance (QA) processes and achieve safe nuclear facility operations. DOE G 414. 1 - 4 was developed to provide guidance on establishing and implementing effective QA processes tied specifically to nuclear facility safety software applications. The Guide includes software application practices covered by appropriate national and international consensus standards and various processes currently in use at DOE facilities. While the safety software guidance is considered to be of sufficient rigor and depth to ensure acceptable reliability of safety software at all DOE nuclear facilities, new nuclear facilities are well suited {{to take advantage of the}} guide to ensure compliant programs and processes are implemented. Attributes such as the facility life-cycle stage and the hazardous nature of each facility operations are considered, along with the category and level of importance of the software. The discussion provided herein illustrates benefits of applying the Safety Software Guide to work activities dependent on software applications and directed toward the design of new nuclear facilities. In particular, the Guide-based systematic approach with software enables design processes to effectively proceed and reduce the likelihood of rework activities.
