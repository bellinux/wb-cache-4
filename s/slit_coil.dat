40|$|Abstract: Lifting of coils {{with the}} bore in the {{vertical}} orientation could {{give rise to}} safety issues if the coil integrity is compromised during the slitting and packing operation. Coil telescoping (whereby the inner wraps of the coil spiral out) is known to occur during lifting, which could pose as {{a serious threat to}} the safety of personnel involved. In this type of incident, the coil straps are also broken when their breaking strength is exceeded and the whole coil would unwrap itself at an elevated position. Back tension is applied to the strip while shearing wide strip into narrower slits; this allows sufficient radial pressure to be built up within the bulk of the narrow coils. Upon unloading, the radial pressures at the innermost and outermost wraps decrease to zero but the bulk of the inter-wrap pressure within the coil remains largely unchanged. The interwrap frictional forces developed within the coil enable the coil to retain its integrity under its own weight. It is found that the radial pressures developed within the <b>slit</b> <b>coil</b> play the most crucial role in providing sufficient frictional resistance to support the weight of the coil wraps during lifting with the bore in the vertical orientation. In addition, the inter-wrap pressures near the footprint of the mechanical lifting device, near the bore, have the most significant influence in preventing coil telescoping...|$|E

5000|$|Enoplea are {{distinguished}} from Chromadorea {{by a number}} of characteristics. The enoplean esophagus is cylindrical or [...] "bottle-shaped", compared to the bulbous chromadorean esophagus. Enopleans have pocket-like amphids, while chromadoreans have amphids shaped like <b>slits,</b> pores, <b>coils,</b> or spirals. An enoplean is smooth or marked with fine lines, while a chromadorean may have rings, projections, or setae. The enoplean excretory system is simple, sometimes made up of a single cell, while chromadoreans have more complex, tubular systems, sometimes with glands.|$|R
40|$|The {{shape and}} {{orientation}} of a polymer {{in a good}} solvent confined between two parallel plates is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations of self-avoiding random walks on a simple cubic lattice. Decreasing {{the width of the}} <b>slit,</b> the <b>coil</b> starts, due to its anisotropic shape, to orient long before its shape changes. Only after the longest principal axis is aligned considerably parallel to the plates, the coil is squeezed. Using a scaled distance between the plates, a corresponding state behavior as a function of chain length is found. The results are in good agreement with predictions based on an analytical rigid ellipsoid model with principal axesâ€™ lengths set equal to the span lengths along the principal axes of inertia of the self-avoiding random walk. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{analytical}} design and experimental realization of a {{scheme based on}} multi-arm <b>coiling</b> <b>slits</b> to generate the stable acoustic vortices in a broadband. The proposed structure is able to spiral the acoustic wave spatially and generate the twisted acoustic vortices with invariant topological charge for a long propagation distance. Compared with conventional methods which require the electronic control of a bulky loudspeaker, this scheme provides an effective and compact solution to generate acoustic vortices with controllable topological charge in the broadband, which offers more initiatives in the demanding applications...|$|R
40|$|Contactless {{fluid level}} {{detection}} in process equipment {{is an important}} challenge for the process automation industry, especially under high-pressure conditions. In this study, a method is presented, which permits the contactless measurement of liquid levels in thin opaque capillaries at high pressures. The method {{is based on the}} mass dependence of the flexural resonance frequencies of a finite section of a tube. These resonance frequencies are determined from the complex electrical impedance of a <b>slitted</b> toroid <b>coil</b> exciting a magnet attached to the tube. The system has been theoretically described using a set of two Bernoulli-Euler beams, resulting in an analytical solution for the equation of motion. To validate the model, experiments have been performed on a thick-walled stainless steel capillary partly filled with mercury. The model is in good agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the sensitivity of the method appears to be adequate as a fluid level indicator for control purposes in industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Single polymer chains {{undergo a}} phase {{transition}} from coiled conformations to globular conformations as the effective attraction between monomers becomes strong enough. In this work, we investigated the coil-globule transition of a semiflexible chain confined between two parallel plates, i. e. a slit, using the lattice model and Pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) algorithm. We find {{that as the}} slit height decreases, the critical attraction for the coil-globule transition changes non-monotonically due to the competition of the confinement free energies of the coiled and globular states. In wide (narrow) <b>slits,</b> the <b>coiled</b> state experiences more (less) confinement free energy, and hence the transition becomes easier (more difficult). In addition, {{we find that the}} transition becomes less sharp with the decreasing slit height. Here, the sharpness refers to the sensitivity of thermodynamic quantities when varying the attraction around the critical value. The relevant experiments can be performed for DNA condensation in microfluidic devices. Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology CenterNational Science Foundation (U. S.)

40|$|For HVAC system commissioning, it is {{important}} to evaluate the performance of the cooling coil in an air-handling unit. However, manual evaluation requires {{a great deal of time}} and effort. One solution is to predict the coil performance by simulation. However, it remains unclear whether the currently available simulation models can provide accurate results under various operational conditions. In the present study, a <b>slit</b> fin type <b>coil</b> was investigated by conducting two series of experiments, for the VAV system and the CAV system, respectively.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>slit</b> (or sheared) <b>coil</b> edges have a great {{influence}} on the secondary rejection of the products that join both slit edges together by either electrical resistance welding or arc welding, such as tubes and pipes, as well as shells of pressure vessels. Unacceptable imperfections in the weld area have many causes. They could be attributed to improper equipment, improper operation or improper materials, or any combination of these. 1 To maintain dimensional tolerance and to avoid the failure to expel mill edge oxides into the beads scarfed off, both edges of narrow strips must be trimmed before the formin...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{mitigate}} intra-gradient coil eddy currents in a hybrid MRI-LINAC system. Methods: The tracks of the gradient coils are modified by cutting slits along the current flow direction. The electromagnetic model developed was first experimentally validated and then used to study the impacts of the slit conductors on the energized and surrounding coils. In this study, gradient <b>coils</b> were <b>slit</b> with different numbers of sub-Tracks and driven by a current with frequencies ranging from 100 Hz to 10 kHz. The proposed configuration was assessed by evaluating a number of system parameters, such as the gradient magnetic field, the power loss generated in the surrounding unenergized coil (hereafter referred to as passive coils), and the performance of the energized coil. Results: It was found that at a typical operating frequency of 1 kHz and compared with a conventional (no cut) split coil structure, the new coil pattern (with four <b>slits)</b> offered improved <b>coil</b> parameters. 1) The average power loss dissipated in the surrounding passive coil was significantly reduced by 85...|$|R
