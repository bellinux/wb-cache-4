40|$|Abstract- Newly {{developed}} turbocharger Swing {{valve assembly}} (arm and bush) {{has to be}} tested to study the product life cycle and to know the satisfactory working throughout entire duty cycle. The turbine housing consists of <b>swing</b> valve <b>assembly</b> used to bypass the exhaust gas directly to atmosphere whenever not required. This assembly consists of two types of fits. Interference fit between turbine housing and bush and clearance fit between bush and arm. But, it is expensive and requires more time to carry out experimental study and measurements can be made only at {{the limited number of}} time stations. So, Finite element method is considered as a standard approach which is economical avoiding frequent experimental studies to find the performance of turbochargers. This paper deals with structural analysis of turbocharger’s <b>swing</b> valve <b>assembly</b> where von misses stress distributions are plotted for both minimum and maximum interference cases due to thermal loads acting b/w bush and turbine housing. Meshed turbocharger and <b>swing</b> valve <b>assembly</b> model is imported to ANSYS for solving and preprocessing and given run for structural analysis. Finally contact pressure v/s time graph is plotted...|$|R
50|$|The bike had a {{prototype}} sprung frame built under the Bentley and Draper patents. The frame {{as far back}} as the gearbox bracket was normal K. Behind this however is a triangulated tubular <b>swinging</b> fork <b>assembly</b> worked in a trunnion bearing. From the rear fork-ends two seta-stays were pivoted and connected to the sprung part of the frame below the saddle by a system of links and spindles incorporating two coil springs. Friction dampers were fitted to these links and there were also two more at the bottom pivots at the fork-ends.|$|R
50|$|ASTM F1577 is a Standard Test Method for Detention Locks for Swinging Doors. This {{standard}} {{was created by}} the American Standard for Testing and Materials (ASTM). ASTM International which was funded in 1898, is an international standards developing organization that develops and publishes standards {{for a wide range of}} materials, products, systems, and services. This {{standard was}} published by ASTM F33 which is a committee specializes about detention and correctional facilities. FM 33 has published 14 standards in this area. This standard deals with the equipment, procedures, and acceptance conditions for determining the normal operational performance and the performance characteristics under several conditions of locks used in <b>swinging</b> door <b>assemblies</b> into several organizations including detention and correctional institutions. Several features are not considered such as both installation and maintenance conditions.|$|R
50|$|The basic SUB-2000 {{design is}} {{implemented}} {{in a rather}} unusual folding design that folds for storage into half its total extended length. Folding is accomplished by pulling downward on the trigger guard and <b>swinging</b> the barrel <b>assembly</b> back {{over the top of}} the rifle. A latch in the buttstock secures to the front sight housing, and the gun can be locked with a key in the folded position for added safety. The gun cannot be fired when folded.|$|R
50|$|The {{customary}} {{train consist}} was two coaches, the piston carriage, {{which included a}} guard's compartment and third class accommodation, and a first class carriage, with end observation windows at the rear. The guard had a screw brake, but no other control. Returning (descending) was done under gravity, and the guard had a lever which enabled him to <b>swing</b> the piston <b>assembly</b> to one side, so that the descent was made with the piston outside the tube.|$|R
50|$|ASTM F1450 is a {{standard}} test method for hollow metal <b>swinging</b> door <b>assemblies</b> for detention facilities. This standard {{was created by the}} American Standard for Testing and Materials (ASTM). ASTM International which was founded in 1898, is an international standards developing organization that develops and publishes standards {{for a wide range of}} materials, products, systems, and services. This standard was published by ASTM F33, a committee which specializes in detention and correctional facilities. This method dealt with requirements for test to determine the performance characteristics of swinging detention hollow metal door assemblies of various styles and types of construction. The aim is to test the capability to prevent intrusion, avoid unauthorized access and to resist common types of vandalism in an organization. In this regards, ASTM has simulated repeated exertion of tremendous amounts of impact energy against a door in order to break through.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A novel PM arc {{guideway}} motor (PMAGM) {{is developed}} {{due to the}} drawback of the conventional motor reciprocating within certain angle. The PMAGM can directly drive load to make reciprocating motion within a limited angle with advantages of simplification, reliability, high efficiency, etc [...] Aiming at the permanent magnet (PM) magnetization and solenoid coil electrifying modes, the PM deflection angle is parameterized and the influence on electromagnetic force has been analyzed between different magnetization and electrifying modes. Results show that electromagnetic force in Y direction magnetized along the external field force lines at proposal 1 is 51. 23 % {{higher than that of}} vertical magnetization, and the electromagnetic resultant force increases by 45. 91 %. As the angle of the PM deflection within 3 º, the electromagnetic force in X direction points to the right, which is not good for PM slidable <b>assembly</b> <b>swing.</b> Based on comprehensive analysis of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} several electrifying modes, the electricity combination under full swing angle is optimized...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} the dimensioning and 3 D modeling of a {{swing check valve}} with lever and weight in welded design, based on the existing 2 D workshop documentation in cast design and reverse engineering. Based on analytical calculations, pipe wall thickness of a swing check valve housing was selected for the nominal pipe diameter DN 300 and water test pressure p = 2. 4 MPa. All 3 D models of components, {{as well as the}} assembly, were made in the program tool SolidWorks. The 3 D model of the swing check valve with flanges was subjected to stress analysis (Finite Element Analysis) for the purpose of checking the accuracy of the analytical calculations. Fluid flow analysis (Flow Simulation) was used for presenting fluid flow process and rate through the <b>swing</b> check valve <b>assembly.</b> A low-budget 3 D MakerBot Replicator 2 X printer was used for constructing a reduced-scale 3 D assembly model of the swing check valve with lever and weight, by implementing the FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) technology. Key words: stress analysis, fluid flow analysis, 2 D workshop documentation, 3 D printer, swing check valve housing...|$|R
