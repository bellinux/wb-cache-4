5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolism.</b> Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E

500|$|The growth-differentiation balance {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} plant defenses {{are a result}} of a tradeoff between [...] "growth-related processes" [...] and [...] "differentiation-related processes" [...] in different environments. Differentiation-related processes are defined as [...] "processes that enhance the structure or function of existing cells (i.e. maturation and specialization)." [...] A plant will produce chemical defenses only when energy is available from photosynthesis, and plants with the highest concentrations of secondary metabolites are the ones with an intermediate level of available resources. The GDBH also accounts for tradeoffs between growth and defense over a resource availability gradient. In situations where resources (e.g. water and nutrients) limit photosynthesis, carbon supply is predicted to limit both growth and defense. As resource availability increases, the requirements needed to support photosynthesis are met, allowing for accumulation of carbohydrate in tissues. As resources are not sufficient to meet the large demands of growth, these carbon compounds can instead be partitioned into the synthesis of carbon based secondary metabolites (phenolics, tannins, etc.). In environments where the resource demands for growth are met, carbon is allocated to rapidly dividing meristems (high sink strength) at the expense of <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolism.</b> Thus rapidly growing plants are predicted to contain lower levels of secondary metabolites and vice versa. In addition, the tradeoff predicted by the GDBH may change over time, as evidenced by a recent study on Salix spp. Much support for this hypothesis is present in the literature, and some scientists consider the GDBH the most mature of the plant defense hypotheses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background More {{and more}} {{completely}} sequenced fungal genomes are becoming available {{and many more}} sequencing projects are in progress. This deluge of data should improve {{our knowledge of the}} various primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolisms</b> of Fungi, including their synthesis of useful compounds such as antibiotics or toxic molecules such as mycotoxins. Functional annotation of many fungal genomes is imperfect, especially of genes encoding enzymes, so we need dedicated tools to analyze their metabolic pathways in depth. Description FUNGIpath is a new tool built using a two-stage approach. Groups of orthologous proteins predicted using complementary methods of detection were collected in a relational database. Each group was further mapped on to steps in the metabolic pathways published in the public databases KEGG and MetaCyc. As a result, FUNGIpath allows the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolisms</b> of the different fungal species represented in the database to be compared easily, making it possible to assess the level of specificity of various pathways at different taxonomic distances. It is freely accessible at [URL]. Conclusions As more and more fungal genomes are expected to be sequenced during the coming years, FUNGIpath should help progressively to reconstruct the ancestral primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolisms</b> of the main branches of the fungal tree of life and to elucidate the evolution of these ancestral fungal metabolisms to various specific derived metabolisms. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Due to {{difficulty}} in measuring phenotypes, less {{is known about}} the roles of WRKY transcription factors in plant metabolism.

[...] Additionally, WRKYs are needed for proper expression of lignin biosynthetic pathway genes, which form products necessary for cell wall and xylem formation. [...] Analysis of WRKY transcription factors from numerous plant species indicates the importance of the family in regulating <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolism.</b> [...] WRKY transcription factors also play a role in regulating pathways for the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically valuable plant-specialized metabolites.|$|E

However, research regarding their combined effects on growth and biochemical properties of roots is still scarce. Using open top chambers, we monitored the response of growth, secondary metabolites, endogenous hormones and enzyme activities of soybean roots to elevated O 3 and enhanced UV-B individually and in combination at stages of branching, flowering and podding. Our {{results indicated that the}} root biomass decreased by 23. 6, 25. 2, and 27. 7 %, and root oxidative capacity declined by 11. 2, 39. 9, and 55. 7 % exposed to elevated O 3, enhanced UV-B, and O 3 + UV-B, respectively, compared to the control treatment. Concentrations of quercetin and ABA were significantly increased, while concentrations of total polyphenol and P-coumaric acid responded insignificantly to elevated O 3, enhanced UV-B, and O 3 + UV-B during the whole period of soybean growth. Elevated O 3, enhanced UV-B and O 3 + UV-B showed significant negative effects on superoxide dismutase (EC 1. 15. 1. 1) activity at flowering stage, on activities of peroxidase (EC 1. 11. 1. 7) and catalase (EC 1. 11. 1. 6) at podding stage, on ascorbate peroxidase activity during the whole period of soybean growth. Moreover, compared to hormones and enzyme activity, <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolisms</b> showed stronger correlation with root growth exposed to elevated O 3 and enhanced UV-B individually and in combination.

Previously, by genomic and transcriptomic analysis, it {{has been}} reported that, at the early stage of symptom development, both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolisms</b> are modified. The present study is based on the hypothesis that fully developed leafy gall, could represent a potential source of new bioactive compounds. Therefore, non-targeted metabolomic analysis of aqueous and chloroform extracts of leafy gall and non-infected tobacco was carried out by 1 H-NMR coupled to principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Polar metabolite profiling reflects modifications mainly in the primary metabolites and in some polyphenolics. In contrast, main modifications occurring in non-polar metabolites concern secondary metabolites, and gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) evidenced alterations in diterpenoids family.

50|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>metabolism</b> {{produces}} {{a large number}} of specialized compounds (estimated 200,000) that do not aid in the growth and development of plants but are required for the plant to survive in its environment. <b>Secondary</b> <b>metabolism</b> is connected to primary metabolism by using building blocks and biosynthetic enzymes derived from primary metabolism. Primary metabolism governs all basic physiological processes that allow a plant to grow and set seeds, by translating the genetic code into proteins, carbohydrates, and amino acids. Specialized compounds from <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolism</b> are essential for communicating with other organisms in mutualistic (e.g. attraction of beneficial organisms such as pollinators) or antagonistic interactions (e.g. deterrent against herbivores and pathogens).

40|$|A {{large amount}} of {{inedible}} plant material, generated {{as a result of}} plant growth in a Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS), should be pretreated and converted into forms that can be recycled on earth as well as in space. The main portion of the inedible biomass is lignocellulosic material. Enzymatic hydrolysis of this cellulose would provide sugars for many other uses by recycling carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen through formation of carbon dioxide, heat, and sugars, which are potential foodstuffs. To obtain monosaccharides from cellulose, the protective effect of lignin should be removed. White-rot fungi degrade lignin more extensively and rapidly than other microorganisms. Pleurotus ostreatus degrades lignin effectively, and produces edible and flavorful mushrooms that increase the quality and nutritional value of the diet. This mushroom is also capable of metabolizing hemicellulose, thereby providing a food use of this pentose containing polysaccharide. This study presents the current knowledge of physiology and biochemistry of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>metabolisms</b> of basidiomycetes, and degradation mechanism of lignin.
