40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{flow field}} near the banks of alluvial channels is the primary factor controlling rates of bank erosion. Although <b>submerged</b> slump <b>blocks</b> and associated large-scale bank roughness elements have both previously been proposed to divert flow away from the bank, direct observations {{of the interaction between}} eroded bank material and the 3 -D flow field are lacking. Here we use observations from multibeam echo sounding, terrestrial laser scanning, and acoustic Doppler current profiling to quantify, for the first time, the influence of <b>submerged</b> slump <b>blocks</b> on the near-bank flow field. In contrast to previous research emphasizing their influence on flow diversion away from the bank, we show that slump blocks may also deflect flow onto the bank, thereby increasing local shear stresses and rates of erosion.

40|$|The {{generation}} and dissipation of pore pressure excess {{due to the}} rapid, mutual sliding of two water-saturated blocks which are composed of glued arrays of cylindrical rods is herein theoretically examined. The mathematical model consists of three ordinary differential equations describing the motion of a solid mass coupled with the continuity of a fluid mass. These equations are numerically solved for the following conditions: (a) motion induced by the constant horizontal velocity of the sliding mass; (b) constant drag force acting in a horizontal direction; (c) gliding on the irregular, inclined surface that envelops the rods. Theoretical predictions for case (a) favorably compare with experimental results reported in literature from an investigation carried out on a physical model resembling the treated theoretical system. Primary {{results show that the}} pore pressure excess depends upon physical and geometrical parameters, and furthermore, that displacement of the rods and pore pressure excess are strongly coupled. Maximum pore water pressure occurs when “fluidization”, i. e. the complete balancing of <b>submerged</b> <b>block</b> weight by pore pressure excess, is achieved. The latter does not coincide with the rising of the upper block (hydroplaning). A cyclic motion is reached under condition (a), when dynamic pore water pressure increases from a negative to a maximum positive value and then falls again to a negative value. On the other hand, non-cyclical motion and monotonically increasing pore water pressure are obtained under sliding conditions (b) and (c). The response of the model under condition (c), which is of particular interest for run-out analyses of flow slides, is compared to the sliding response of ordinary <b>submerged</b> <b>blocks</b> on a slope, showing significant differences and pointing out the roles of particle diameter, layer extent and medium permeability. The occurrence of different pore pressure states for fluidization and hydroplaning is highlighted. This, hopefully, can open the way to a reliable treatment of the mechanics of sub-marine flow slide propagation...|$|R

40|$|Short-term heating of {{softwood}} veneer blocks temporarily softens {{the wood}} {{so that it}} can be peeled more readily. Heating reduces the depth of lathe checks and the likelihood of splitting and thereby increases the quality and quantity of veneer recovered. The softwood-plywood industry conventionally conditions blocks three ways: steaming blocks in drive-in chambers, deluging blocks in such chambers with hot water, or <b>submerging</b> <b>blocks</b> in feed-through vats of hot water. About 450 to 1, 000 lb of steam are required to heat blocks with a veneer volume of 1, 000 ft², 3 / 8 -in. basis. The best wood temperature for peeling falls between 120 °F and 140 °F, but the heating periods often are too short for the wood to reach the target temperature because blocks are not properly segregated into diameter classes. Furthermore, heated blocks cool rapidly during transfer. An infrared sensor system reported here gives industry a tool to monitor block temperature. The profitability of conditioning will depend on the cost of the installation and cash from increased veneer yields...|$|R
40|$|A fully {{three-dimensional}} {{unsteady flow}} model is developed to simulate free surface flow over a submerged structure. A new sigma coordinate {{is used to}} map the physical domain containing the wavy free surface and uneven bottom to a rectangular prism, {{and to keep the}} size of the <b>submerged</b> <b>block</b> unchanged in the sigma coordinate system. The numerical difficulty encountered in the conventional sigma coordinate system in which the block changes dynamically due to the time varying free surface is thus eliminated. A split operator scheme is used in the numerical solution so that different numerical schemes can be purposely chosen to deal with the distinctive mathematical and physical characteristics of the phenomena at different steps. k-ε model is used in the parameterization of turbulence due to its efficiency and reasonable performance. The model is applied to simulate the propagation of a solitary wave with good results. It is subsequently used to simulate a free surface flow against a submerged cube with one face perpendicular (or 45 ° inclined) to the flow. The numerical results compare favorably with the experimental measurements. In particular, no excessive turbulent kinetic energy is accumulated at the impingement regions.

40|$|Hydraulic {{resistance}} {{is one of}} the most important factors which affect the velocity of the partially submerged landslide when it moves into river at a high speed. In this paper, an experiment system was designed including a water tank, a moving frame fixed over the tank with liquid level sensors, blocks, and velocity control apparatus. Six blocks with different areas were used for experiments and each block moved at five different velocities in water tank. Test results showed that the increment of the pressure head was proportional to the square velocity of <b>submerged</b> <b>block.</b> Based on that, the total water pressure and corresponding hydraulic resistance of the moving block in water tank were obtained, and the latter was used to analyze hydraulic resistance acting on partially submerged landslide. Method of slice was applied to calculate the forces of landslide with curved slip surface. The dynamics and kinematics equation of landslide were used to calculate the velocity. Taking the Dayantang landslide as an example, velocities with different travel distance were obtained. The results showed that the maximum velocity of Dayantang landslide considering hydraulic resistance was 18. 6 % less than that without considering hydraulic resistance...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} the relative energy dissipation that occurs in <b>submerged</b> <b>block</b> ramps conditions. Block ramps generally produce high energy dissipation. Most of the previous studies were confined in finding the energy dissipation throughout the ramp. The energy dissipation and flow conditions when the ramp is submerged have received relatively little attention, whereas this type of condition can often take place in case of high discharge and fluvial flow conditions. The present study shows {{the result of the}} experimental investigations conducted at Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy on ramps characterized by different bed materials and different submerged conditions keeping constant the ramp slope. The experiments were carried out for a slope of 1 V: 6 H in different submerged ramp conditions. The study shows that the energy loss varying jump location on the ramp is function of scale roughness, the ratio between the critical water depth and ramp height and the ratio between the ramp length and the reduced ramp length in submerged condition. The present study also investigates the differences in energy dissipation for submerged jump in different bed conditions such as fixed smooth bed and mobile bed...|$|R
