40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{duration}} of voicing and <b>silence</b> <b>periods</b> of continuous speech in rooms with very different reverberation times (RTs). Measurements were conducted using the Ambulatory Phonation Monitoring (APM) 3200 (Kaypentax) and Voice-Care devices (developed at the Politecnico di Torino, Italy), {{both of which have}} a contact microphone placed on the base of the neck to detect skin vibrations during phonation. Six university professors and 22 university students made short laboratory monologs in which they explained something that they knew well to a listener 6 m away. Seven students also described a map with the intention of correctly explaining directions to a listener who drew the path on a blank chart. Longer speech samples were made by primary school teachers in classrooms. A tendency to increase the voicing periods as the RT increased was on average observed for the university professors, the school teachers, and the university students who described a map. These students also showed longer <b>silence</b> <b>periods</b> than the students who made short monologues. The recognized trends concerned voice professionals or subjects who were highly motivated to make themselves understood in a perturbed speaking situation.

5000|$|International {{refinements}} {{for the use}} of 500 kHz were {{specified in}} later agreements, including the 1932 Madrid Radio Conference. In later years, except for distress traffic, stations shifted to nearby [...] "working frequencies" [...] to exchange messages once contact was established. 425, 454, 468, 480, and 512 kHz were used by ships while the coast stations had their own individual working frequencies. Twice each hour, all stations operating on 500 kHz were required to maintain a strictly enforced three-minute silent period, starting at 15 and 45 minutes past the hour.As a visual memory aid, a typical clock in a ship's radio room would have the silence periods marked by shading the sectors between h+15 to h+18 and h+45 to h+48 in RED. Similar sectors between h+00 to H+03 and h+30 to h+33 are marked in GREEN which is the corresponding <b>silence</b> <b>period</b> for the 2182 kHz voice communications distress signals. In addition, during this silent period all coastal and ship stations were required to monitor the frequency, listening for any distress signals. All large ships at sea had to monitor 500 kHz at all times, either with a licensed radio operator or with equipment that automatically detected an SOS alarm signal. [...] Shore stations throughout the world operated on this frequency to exchange messages with ships and to issue warning about weather and other navigational warnings. At night, transmission ranges of 3,000-4,000 miles (4,500-6,500 kilometers) were typical. Daytime ranges were much shorter, on the order of 300-1500 miles (500-2,500 kilometers). Terman's Radio Engineering Handbook (1948) shows the maximum distance for 1 kW over salt water to be 1,500 miles, and this distance was routinely covered by ships at sea, where signals from ships and nearby coastal stations would cause congestion, covering up distant and weaker signals. During the silence, a distress signal could more easily be heard at great distances.|$|E

40|$|Preserving {{location}} {{privacy in}} vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) {{is an important}} requirement for public accep- tance of this emerging technology. Many privacy schemes concern changing pseudonyms periodically to avoid linking messages. However, the spatiotemporal information con- tained in beacons makes vehicles traceable and the driver’s privacy breached. Therefore, the pseudonym change should be performed in a mix-context to discontinue the spatial and temporal correlation of subsequent beacons. Such mix- context is commonly accomplished by using a <b>silence</b> <b>period</b> or in predetermined locations (e. g., mix-zone). In this pa- per, we propose a location privacy scheme that lets vehicles decide when to change its pseudonym and enter a <b>silence</b> <b>period</b> and when to exit from it adaptively based on its con- text. In this scheme, a vehicle monitors the surrounding vehicles and enters silence when it finds one or more neigh- bors silent. It resumes beaconing with a new pseudonym when its actual state {{is likely to be}} mixed with the state of a silent neighbor. We evaluate this scheme against a global multi-target tracking adversary using simulated and realistic vehicle traces and compare it with the random silent period scheme. Furthermore, we evaluate the quality of service of a forward collision warning safety application to ensure its applicability in safety applications. We measure the quality of service by estimating the probability of correctly identify- ing the fundamental factors of that application using Monte Carlo analysis...|$|E

The article presents a theoretical analysis {{of the distribution of}} transmitted messages, an information theory interpretation of selective reporting sensing scheme and a study on the behaviour of the algorithm when the received signal is subject to fading caused by the wireless channel that links primary transmitter and cognitive radio user. The theoretical analysis is backed up by numerical and experimental results that show that the PFA and PMD are similar to standard reporting schemes, validating the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can be used jointly with censorship and user selection algorithms to further reduce the bandwidth demanded of the sensing report channel.|$|R

Applications like VoIP do not perform well under PSM mode however, due to their real-time nature, so the energy footprint is quite high. The challenge is to save energy while not affecting performance. In this paper we present SiFi: Silence prediction based WiFi energy adaptation. SiFi examines audio streams from phone calls and tracks when <b>silence</b> <b>periods</b> start and stop. This data is stored in a prediction model.
