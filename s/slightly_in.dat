50|$|Baclofen {{is a white}} (or off-white) mostly odorless {{crystalline}} powder, with {{a molecular}} weight of 213.66 g/mol. It is <b>slightly</b> soluble <b>in</b> water, very <b>slightly</b> soluble <b>in</b> methanol, and insoluble in chloroform.|$|R

5|$|In 1791, Jacques-Joseph Saint-Martin, an agronomist from Limoges, {{acknowledged}} {{the importance of}} Limousin cattle in the markets of cities such as Paris, Lyon and Toulouse. Limousin cattle actually came from the departments of Charente, Dordogne, Haute-Vienne, Vienne, Lot, Corrèze and Creuse. The market for Limousin cattle declined <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> the early 19th century, but livestock still remained a major activity in the region.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the route was {{truncated}} to consist {{only of the}} portion east of the Hudson River. NY43's former routing west to Schoharie was redesignated NY443 as a result. NY43 was realigned <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> the late 1990s to serve the new exit8 on I-90. Its former routing into Rensselaer on 3rd Avenue is now partly NY151 and unsigned NY915E.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the affair}} brought such a shock {{that people were}} sobered. The legal battle had been lost, the {{railroad}} had won, {{and there was not}} enough public support for changing the policy of granting public lands to railroads. The only concession SP made was to reduce the land price <b>slightly.</b> <b>In</b> the end, most people simply stayed where they were and purchased the land.|$|E

5|$|The six Regioni-class cruisersso {{named as}} all vessels save Elba were named for regions of Italywere the first {{protected}} cruisers designed by Italian naval architects. They were built by four different shipyards, and so varied <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> size, speed, and armament. They {{proved to be}} a disappointment in service, owing to their slow speed and weak armor protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} end of US127 was rerouted in 1930 from Somerset south to Hudson and on to Cincinnati, Ohio. The section of former US127 between Somerset and Toledo became US223. The northern end was shifted <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> 1950 {{in the city of}} Lansing when US27 was rerouted from its car-only route to its truck route and US127 was realigned to connect to the new routing.|$|E
5|$|After {{the storm}} {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about six}} hours, the IMD downgraded Gonu to very severe cyclonic storm status late on June 4. Its eye became cloud-filled and ragged, and the cyclone gradually weakened due to cooler water temperatures and drier air as it approached the Arabian Peninsula. Due to land interaction with Oman, the inner core of deep convection rapidly weakened, and {{over a period of}} 24hours the intensity decreased by 95km/h (60mph). According to the IMD, Cyclone Gonu crossed the easternmost tip of Oman still as a very severe cyclonic storm early on June 6. Although the winds continued to gradually decrease, overall organization increased <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> the hours prior to landfall; Gonu maintained a well-defined low-level structure with a weak eye.|$|E

5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, {{will have a better}} chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the balance}} of power {{appeared}} to move <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> Matilda's favour. Robert of Gloucester besieged Stephen in 1143 at Wilton Castle, an assembly point for royal forces in Herefordshire. Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the Battle of Wilton. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved too strong, and for a moment it appeared that Stephen might be captured for a second time, before finally managing to escape. Later in the year Geoffrey de Mandeville, the Earl of Essex, rose up in rebellion against Stephen in East Anglia. Geoffrey based himself from the Isle of Ely and began a military campaign against Cambridge, with the intention of progressing south towards London. Ranulf of Chester revolted once again in the summer of 1144.|$|E
5|$|Before {{each game}} and single-player Conquest, players choose between Sports and Action camera views. Action view is a {{trailing}} third-person shot similar to {{looking over the}} player-character's shoulder, while Sports view is a spectator perspective similar that of a televised basketball game. Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports view. The camera view cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view camera swings wildly and can be pulled back <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> the menus.|$|E

5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle has closely {{associated}} with the legend of Sir Guy the Seeker since at least the early 19th century. Different versions of the story vary <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> their details, but typically involve a knight, Sir Guy, arriving at Dunstanburgh Castle, where he was met by a wizard and led inside. There he comes across a noble lady imprisoned inside a crystal tomb and guarded by a sleeping army. The wizard offers Guy a choice of either a sword or a hunting horn to help free the lady; he incorrectly chooses the horn, which wakes the sleeping knights. Sir Guy finds himself outside Dunstanburgh Castle, and spends {{the rest of his life}} attempting to find a way back inside.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s various {{internal}} {{changes and}} improvements {{were made to}} the mechanics. In 1969 the hammer tips were changed to neoprene rubber instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed from wood to aluminum. Although this made production cheaper, it changed the resonance of the instrument <b>slightly.</b> <b>In</b> 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model. The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A new 54-note model was added to the range.|$|E
5|$|However, one {{can combine}} the nominal solar mass {{parameter}} {{with the most}} recent (2014) CODATA estimate of the Newtonian gravitational constant G to derive the solar mass to be approximately 1.9885 × 1030 kg. Although the exact values for the luminosity, radius, mass parameter, and mass may vary <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> the future due to observational uncertainties, the 2015 IAU nominal constants will remain the same SI values as they remain useful measures for quoting stellar parameters.|$|E

5|$|In 2001-02 {{the overall}} gender ratio was about 57.1% female to 42.9% male for {{enrolled}} students, or about 15 males for every 20 females. This gender gap has improved <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> {{recent years to}} 55.8% female and 44.2% male, or about 16 males for every 20 females in 2014-15 (non-binary genders were not reported). However, this gap is worse for graduation rates, with 59% of degrees conferred on females. Gender ratios also depend on undergraduate versus graduate enrollment, and department.|$|E
5|$|More of a {{traditional}} rivalry due to {{the large amount of}} Kiwi internationals Melbourne has fielded in their history. Matches between the two clubs are normally close and low scoring, with the overall head to head (as of 2016) <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> Melbourne's favour (37 clashes, Storm 19-Warriors 16 & 2 draws). These two sides played an annual ANZAC Day clash each year between 2009–2014. For 2015 it was played earlier in April before moving back to ANZAC Day for 2016.|$|E
5|$|Over land, the {{hurricane}} weakened to a tropical storm, although it re-intensified <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> the Gulf of Mexico. On September25, {{it made a}} second landfall just south of Tampico, Tamaulipas with winds at around , and it quickly dissipated over land. Damage was heaviest there, estimated at $5million (1933USD) and {{there were hundreds of}} deaths. About 75% of the houses in Tampico were damaged, including about 50% of houses that had severe to total destruction to their roofs. The destruction prompted the declaration of martial law, and there was a curfew instated.|$|E
