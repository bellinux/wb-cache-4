50|$|Later in {{the century}} Joseph Haydn {{composed}} Acide e Galatea (1763) as his first opera while in Vienna. Designed for an imperial wedding, it was given a happy ending centred on the transformation scene after the murder of Acis as the pair declare their undying love. Johann Gottlieb Naumann was to turn the story into a comic opera, Aci e Galatea, with the <b>subtitle</b> <b>i</b> ciclopi amanti (the amorous cyclops). The work was first performed in Dresden in 1801 and its plot was made more complicated by giving Polifemo a companion, Orgonte. There were also two other lovers, Dorinda and Lisia, with Orgonte Lisia's rival for Dorinda's love.|$|E

40|$|Nearly half {{a century}} has passed since the {{publication}} of the seminal work of Professor Isard, Location and Space-Economy, which became the basis of a new field called regional science. As indicated by its <b>subtitle</b> (<b>i.</b> e., A General Theory Relating to Industrial Location, Market Areas, Land Use, Trade, and Urban Structure), the book was written with the aim of nothing less than initiating the development of a general theory of location and space-economy, embracing the total spatial array of economic activities. Such a theory was supposed to include both the traditional general equilibrium theory and the international trade theory as special cases. In this paper, first I shall discuss what were his possible ideas on the general theory, given the state of economic science at that time, and what were the main contributions of Location and Space-Economy in initiating the development of such a theory. Second, I review the major contributions of subsequent works by Professor Isard and other scholars from the viewpoint of the development of the general theory. Finally, I discuss possible future directions in developing such a theory. ...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to sketch and defend a new {{interpretation}} or theory of objective chance, one that lets us be sure such chances exist and shows how they can play the roles we traditionally grant them. The subtitle obviously emulates the title of Lewis seminal 1980 paper A Subjectivist s Guide to Objective Chance while indicating an important difference in perspective. The view developed below shares two major tenets with Lewis last (1994) account of objective chance: (1) The Principal Principle tells us most of what we know about objective chance; (2) Objective chances are not primitive modal facts, propensities, or powers, but rather facts entailed by the overall pattern of events and processes in the actual world. But it differs from Lewis’ account in most other respects. Another <b>subtitle</b> <b>I</b> considered was A Humean Guide [...] . But while the account of chance below is compatible with any stripe of Humeanism (Lewis, Hume s, and others), it presupposes no general Humean philosophy. Only a skeptical attitude about probability itself is presupposed (as in point (2) above); what we should say about causality, laws, modality and so on is left a separate question. Still, I will label the account to be developed “Humean objective chance”...|$|E

40|$|There {{are about}} 116 {{airplanes}} {{of the affected}} design in the worldwide fleet. This AD will affect about 21 airplanes of U. S. registry. The required actions will take about 2 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $ 80 per work hour. Required parts will cost about $ 8 per airplane. Based on these figures, the estimated cost of the AD for U. S. operators is $ 3, 528, or $ 168 per airplane. Authority for This Rulemaking Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA’s authority to issue rules on aviation safety. <b>Subtitle</b> <b>I,</b> Section 106, describes {{the authority of the}} FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency’s authority.

This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action. Regulatory Findings We have determined that this AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132.

Finally, to resolve such recalcitrant problems and difficulties, the study, in its concluding part, suggests some other practical subtitling mechanisms, other than the ones that have been adopted by the film's subtitler...|$|R
