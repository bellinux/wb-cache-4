5|$|The First World War {{slowed down}} {{the growth of}} the Limousin breed, which carried through the inter-war years despite a {{reorganisation}} of the Herd Book in 1923. Herd Book registrations grew <b>slowly,</b> <b>from</b> 600,000 animals in 1890 to 800,000 in 1940.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Bahraini {{scientists}} published 155 {{articles in}} internationally cataloged journals, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). This corresponds to 15 articles per million inhabitants, {{compared to a}} global average of 176 per million inhabitants in 2013. Scientific output has risen <b>slowly</b> <b>from</b> 93 articles in 2005 and remains modest. By 2014, only Mauritania and Palestine had a smaller output in this database among Arab states.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, Mardersteig {{developed}} {{plans for}} a second design, Dante, which was again cut by Malin <b>slowly</b> <b>from</b> 1946 onwards but taken also up by Monotype. Monotype Dante Series 592, Dante Semi Bold Series 682 and Dante Titling Series 612, were only produced in Didot-sizes. It was a more eccentric revival of the Aldine face than Bembo, it did not attract as much popularity.|$|E

5|$|The {{comatose}} {{king was}} returned to Le Mans, where Guillaume de Harsigny—a venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physician—was summoned to treat him. After Charles regained consciousness, and his fever subsided, he {{was returned to}} Paris by Harsigny, moving <b>slowly</b> <b>from</b> castle to castle, with periods of rest in between. Late in September Charles was well {{enough to make a}} pilgrimage of thanks to Notre Dame de Liesse near Laon after which he returned again to Paris.|$|E
5|$|There are 34 known {{vertebrae}} of Plesiorycteropus. The animal had {{at least}} seven sacral and five or six lumbar vertebrae. A find of associated caudal vertebrae {{from the base of}} the tail, which diminish in size only <b>slowly</b> <b>from</b> front to back, suggests that the tail was long. There is no evidence for the additional joints between the vertebrae that are characteristic of xenarthrans. In the seven known thoracic (chest) vertebrae, the articulations with the intervertebral disks are bean-shaped and much wider from side to side than from top to bottom. In the back thoracics and all lumbars, a longitudinal transarcual canal is present in the neural arch.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the plans}} were officially shelved, locals {{continued}} {{to work with the}} idea of a road connecting Averøy with the mainland. The toll company Atlanterhavsveien AS was established in 1970. Arne Rettedal, who was Minister of Local Government and Regional Development in the early 1980s, proposed that job creation funds could be allocated to road projects. The proposal was approved in 1983, after it had been supported by the municipalities of Averøy, Eide and Fræna. Construction started as a municipal road project on 1 August 1983, but progressed <b>slowly.</b> <b>From</b> 1 July 1986, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration took over the project, speeding up construction and allowing it to open on 7 July 1989. During construction, the area was hit by 12 hurricanes. The opening of the road allowed the Tøvik–Ørjavik Ferry to be terminated.|$|E

5|$|English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation {{in the week}} {{leading up to the}} match meant the Test could not start until after midday. Yardley's {{decision}} was regarded as a surprise. Although The Oval had a reputation as a batting paradise, weather conditions suggested that bowlers would be at an advantage. Jack Fingleton, a former Test team-mate of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist, thought the Australians would have bowled had they won the toss. However, O'Reilly disagreed, saying the pitch was so wet it should have favoured the batsmen because the ball would bounce <b>slowly</b> <b>from</b> the surface. He further thought the slippery run-up areas would have forced the faster bowlers to operate less vigorously to avoid injuring themselves. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the bowlers to keep their footing, because parts of the pitch were muddy. The humidity, along with the rain, assisted the bowlers; Lindwall in particular managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E

50|$|Being {{a highly}} dynamic object, even among centaurs, 2005 VD's orbit has visibly changed even since its discovery.

25|$|The NZ Ministry for the Environment {{considers}} {{that the energy}} intensity of New Zealand's economic output has to some degree decreased since 1990.

25|$|The pitch {{itself had}} become slower and slower. Some {{observers}} {{said that it}} was useless to bowlers and batsmen alike. That wasn't true, because some of the batsmen showed beyond all doubt that anyone who could really hit the ball could play it away with ease, power, and safety as it rose <b>slowly</b> <b>from</b> the turf.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this would be {{breathing}} air in an heliox environment. The helium in the heliox diffuses into the skin quickly, while the nitrogen diffuses more <b>slowly</b> <b>from</b> the capillaries to the skin and out of the body. The resulting effect generates supersaturation in certain sites of the superficial tissues and the formation of inert gas bubbles.|$|E

50|$|The spiral mode is the {{tendency}} to <b>slowly</b> diverge <b>from,</b> or {{the tendency}} to slowly return to wings level. If the spiral mode is stable, the aircraft will slowly return to wings-level, if it is unstable, the aircraft will <b>slowly</b> diverge <b>from</b> wings-level. Dihedral effect and yaw stability are the two primary factors that affect {{the stability of the}} spiral mode, although there are other factors that affect it less strongly.|$|R
25|$|Like {{much of the}} south, Bartow {{recovered}} <b>slowly</b> <b>from</b> the war as {{inefficient and}} often corrupt Reconstruction governments did little to rebuild the fractured infrastructure. The first Polk County Courthouse was built in 1867 and this did solidify the city's position as county seat. Although Florida formally rejoined the union in 1868, Reconstruction did not end in Florida until 1877.|$|E
25|$|According to {{estimates}} by the WHO/UNICEF global Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation based on survey and census data, {{the share of}} South Africans with access to improved sanitation increased <b>slowly</b> <b>from</b> 71% in 1990 to 75% in 2000 and 79% in 2010. In 2010, an estimated 11 million South Africans still did {{not have access to}} improved sanitation: They and used shared facilities (4 million), bucket toilets (3 million) or practiced open defecation (4 million).|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the other}} {{functional}} mutations are believed to result in hypoexcitability. The R859C mutation, for example, has a more depolarized voltage dependence of activation, meaning that the membrane must be more depolarized for the channel to open. This mutant also recovers more <b>slowly</b> <b>from</b> inactivation. The nonfunctional channels are believed to produce similar changes in cell excitability. Likewise, many of the nonsense mutations likely result in nonfunctional channels and hypoexcitability, though this {{has yet to be}} tested. It is also unclear how this membrane hypoexcitability leads to the GEFS+ phenotype.|$|E
