40|$|This study {{examined}} origins of possible <b>selves</b> {{and the role}} of Epiphanies. Specifically, of interest was whether there are demographic or self-regulatory differences in possible <b>selves</b> derived from different origins. The sample consisted of 411 participants, with age ranging from 17 – 95. The data was taken from two previous research studies on possible <b>selves.</b> The first research question examined the origins of possible <b>selves.</b> Results indicate that possible <b>selves</b> are derived from Epiphany experiences along with internal and external influences, such as another person, or a particular event. The second research question determined whether there were any demographic, ethnic, or cultural differences in the origins of possible <b>selves.</b> Results showed age, cohort, and socioeconomic status had effects. The final research question addressed whether there were differences in the domains of possible <b>selves</b> derived from various origins. Results indicated differences in domains however there were no clear patterns. The first hypothesis was that possible <b>selves</b> derived from an Epiphany would be considered more important than those derived from other origins. This hypothesis was not supported. The second hypothesis was that hoped-for possible <b>selves</b> {{were more likely to be}} derived from an Epiphany experience than feared <b>selves.</b> This hypothesis was supported. The second hypothesis also stated that possible <b>selves</b> derived from an Epiphany were more likely to be balanced than <b>selves</b> derived from other origins and this was supported for feared <b>selves</b> only. Finally, the third hypothesis stated that there would be self-regulatory differences between <b>selves</b> derived from Epiphanies compared to other origins but this was not supported. Taken together these findings show that the origins of possible <b>selves</b> are important and especially those derived from epiphany. The role of an Epiphany on the formation and implementation of possible <b>selves</b> paves the way for important prevention programs aimed at promoting healthy development and promoting an individual’s well being. ...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{transitions}} from outcrossing to <b>selfing</b> occur commonly in heterostylous genera. The morphological polymorphisms that characterize heterostyly {{provide opportunities for}} different pathways for <b>selfing</b> to evolve. Here, we investigate the origins and pathways by which <b>selfing</b> has evolved in tristylous Eichhornia paniculata by providing new evidence based on morphology, DNA sequences and genetic analysis. The primary pathway from outcrossing to <b>selfing</b> involves the stochastic loss of the short-styled morph (S-morph) from trimorphic populations, followed by the spread of <b>selfing</b> variants of the mid- styled morph (M-morph). However, the discovery of <b>selfing</b> variants of the long- styled morph (L-morph) in Central America indicates a secondary pathway and distinct origin for <b>selfing.</b> Comparisons of multi-locus nucleotide sequences from 27 populations sampled from throughout the geographical range suggest multiple transitions to <b>selfing.</b> Genetic analysis of <b>selfing</b> variants of the L- and M-morphs demonstrates recessive control {{of the loss of}} herkogamy, although the number of factors appears to differ between the forms. Early stages in the establishment of <b>selfing</b> involve developmental instability in the formation of flowers capable of autonomous self-pollination. The relatively simple genetic control of herkogamy reduction and frequent colonizing episodes may often create demographic conditions favouring transitions to <b>selfing</b> in E. paniculata...|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} from cross-fertilisation (outcrossing) to self-fertilisation (<b>selfing)</b> frequently coincides with changes towards a floral morphology that optimises self-pollination, the <b>selfing</b> syndrome. Population genetic {{studies have reported}} the existence of both outcrossing and <b>selfing</b> populations in Arabis alpina (Brassicaceae), which is an emerging model species for studying the molecular basis of perenniality and local adaptation. It is unknown whether its <b>selfing</b> populations have evolved a <b>selfing</b> syndrome. Using macro-photography, microscopy and automated cell counting, we compared floral syndromes (size, herkogamy, pollen and ovule numbers) between three outcrossing populations from the Apuan Alps and three <b>selfing</b> populations from the Western and Central Alps (Maritime Alps and Dolomites). In addition, we genotyped the plants for 12 microsatellite loci to confirm previous measures of diversity and inbreeding coefficients based on allozymes, and performed Bayesian clustering. Plants from the three <b>selfing</b> populations had markedly smaller flowers, less herkogamy and lower pollen production than plants from the three outcrossing populations, whereas pistil length and ovule number have remained constant. Compared to allozymes, microsatellite variation was higher, but revealed similar patterns of low diversity and high Fis in <b>selfing</b> populations. Bayesian clustering revealed two clusters. The first cluster contained the three outcrossing populations from the Apuan Alps, the second contained the three <b>selfing</b> populations from the Maritime Alps and Dolomites. We conclude that in comparison to three outcrossing populations, three populations with high <b>selfing</b> rates are characterised by a flower morphology that {{is closer to the}} <b>selfing</b> syndrome. The presence of outcrossing and <b>selfing</b> floral syndromes within a single species will facilitate unravelling the genetic basis of the <b>selfing</b> syndrome, and addressing which selective forces drive its evolution...|$|R
40|$|Adolescence is a stage full of possibility, {{in which}} {{adolescents}} start exploring {{what is possible}} for them. Possible <b>selves</b> represent people’s self-concept pointing to the future, what they hope to be, what they expect to be and what they fear to be. These future oriented <b>selves</b> are closely related with adolescents’ behaviors, channeling their effort toward positive behavioral outcomes. The possible <b>selves</b> in Chinese context are less examined and adolescents in Hong Kong are facing a lot of challenges and uncertainties in the fast changing society. What are the possible <b>selves</b> among Hong Kong adolescents? How are parental influences associated with possible <b>selves</b> in the Chinese context? How proximal psychological associates, such as planfulness and self-esteem, relate with possible <b>selves</b> among adolescents? The current {{study was designed to}} answer the above questions. There were two phases in the research. Phase one adapted Possible <b>Selves</b> Questionnaire into Chinese (PSQ_C) with a translation and back-translation procedure and two pilot tests. Phase two conducted a large sample survey with secondary school adolescents. 3, 078 participants, aged 12 - 20, were from 99 classes in 11 middle schools. The findings were presented with three themed papers. Research findings were presented in three journal papers with different foci. Paper one investigated the profile of possible <b>selves</b> among Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong, including the content of possible <b>selves,</b> strategies of possible <b>selves</b> and perceived likelihood of possible <b>selves.</b> Gender and age differences were examined. Paper two examined the effect of parental support on possible <b>selves.</b> It was found that parental pragmatic support consistently predicted having at least one strategy and perceived likelihood of hoped-for and feared possible <b>selves,</b> while socio-emotional support was only associated with perceived likelihood of hoped-for possible <b>selves.</b> Paper three examined planfulness and self-esteem as proximal psychological antecedents of possible <b>selves.</b> It was found that both planfulness and self-esteem were positively associated with having at least one strategy and perceived likelihood of hoped-for and feared possible <b>selves.</b> Self-esteem was more related to perceived likelihood whereas planfulness was more related with having strategy. It was found that planfulness and self-esteem mediated the relationship between parental support and possible <b>selves.</b> The current doctoral study complemented the existing literature in terms of theory by exploring the external and proximal psychological antecedents of possible <b>selves</b> and establishing a mediation model to explain the interplay among parental support, planfulness, self-esteem and possible <b>selves.</b> It was the first possible <b>selves</b> study among Hong Kong adolescents. It not only contributed to the indigenous research on adolescents by providing a handy Chinese possible <b>selves</b> questionnaire, enriching the understanding about modern adolescents, but also by providing information for further setup of intervention using possible <b>selves</b> constructs.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>selfing</b> from outcrossing {{is a common}} transition, yet {{little is known about}} the mutations and selective factors that promote this shift. In the mustard family, single-locus self-incompatibility (SI) enforces outcrossing. In this study, we test whether mutations causing self-compatibility (SC) are linked to the self-incompatibility locus (S-locus) in Leavenworthia alabamica, a species where two <b>selfing</b> races (a 2 and a 4) co-occur with outcrossing populations. We also infer the ecological circumstances associated with origins of <b>selfing</b> using molecular sequence data. Genealogical reconstruction of the Lal 2 locus, the putative ortholog of the SRK locus, showed that both <b>selfing</b> races are fixed for one of two different S-linked Lal 2 sequences, whereas outcrossing populations harbor many S-alleles. Hybrid crosses demonstrated that S-linked mutations cause SC in each <b>selfing</b> race. These results strongly suggest two origins of <b>selfing</b> in this species, a result supported by population admixture analysis of 16 microsatellite loci and by a population tree built from eight nuclear loci. One <b>selfing</b> race (a 4) shows signs of a severe population bottleneck, suggesting that reproductive assurance might have caused the {{evolution of}} <b>selfing</b> in this case. In contrast, the population size of race a 2 cannot be distinguished from that of outcrossing populations after correcting for differences in <b>selfing</b> rates. Coalescent-based analyses suggest a relatively old origin of <b>selfing</b> in the a 4 race (; 150 ka ago), whereas <b>selfing</b> evolved recently in the a 2 race (; 12 – 48 ka ago). These results imply that S-locus mutations have triggered two recent shifts to <b>selfing</b> i...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Grounded in {{life span}} theory, this study {{explored}} how personal goals (as measured by possible <b>selves)</b> related to depressive symptoms in older adults. Possible <b>selves</b> represent individuals' ideas of what {{they would like to}} become (hoped-for <b>selves)</b> and what they are afraid of becoming (feared <b>selves).</b> Possible <b>selves</b> are also considered a dynamic aspect of the personality system that have the potential to elicit behavioral change. Because goals can moderate an individual's response to age related loss and promote positive adult development, older adults' ability to manage health and family related possible <b>selves</b> were examined. In addition, teleonomic relevance (i. e., how related one's current projects are to one's future goals) was investigated and associated with depressive symptoms. Eighty-five adults who ranged in age from 60 to 92 (M = 74) were recruited from two primary health care clinics and interviewed face-to-face by the researcher. Poisson regression models based on the count of depressive symptoms reported by participants were analyzed. The results provided initial evidence that the content of older adults' possible <b>selves</b> was associated with depressive symptoms. The presence of health related possible <b>selves</b> was moderately related to fewer depressive symptoms when accounting for one's age, gender, and perceived health status. In addition, the absence of health related possible <b>selves</b> was associated with feeling more worthless and the absence of family related possible <b>selves</b> was associated with feeling helpless and feeling like life was empty. The self-regulatory processes associated with possible <b>selves</b> (e. g., self-efficacy, outcome expectancy) were also related to depressive symptoms. For example, older adults who felt more efficacious in achieving their health and family related hoped-for <b>selves</b> and spent more time thinking about their hoped-for <b>selves</b> reported fewer depressive symptoms. The self-regulation of feared <b>selves</b> was not as significantly associated with depressive symptoms as the self-regulation of hoped-for <b>selves.</b> Finally, teleonomjc relevance was not significantly related to depressive symptoms in this study, but was associated with other goal constructs, such as the manageability and meaningfulness of personal projects, and the number of possible <b>selves.</b> Implications of the study and future research directions are discussed...|$|R

Pollination type and maternal effects may affect plant fitness traits, including life-cycle traits {{as well as}} dispersal ability. This study investigated the joint influence of pollination type and maternal effects on both life-cycle traits and dispersal ability in the herb Hypochaeris radicata. We conducted experimental crosses to obtain <b>selfed</b> and outcrossed progeny. Individual seeds and their pappuses were measured to determine seed terminal velocity. Seed size was also used to assess maternal effects. <b>Selfing</b> dramatically decreased seed set, indicating that H. radicata is self-incompatible. However, the few <b>selfed</b> seeds produced outperformed outcrossed seeds in seed size and flowering probability, surely {{as a result of}} an effective reallocation of resources among <b>selfed</b> seeds. None of the life-cycle traits was affected by seed size, the estimate of maternal effects. <b>Selfed</b> seeds were larger and bore a smaller pappus than outcrossed seeds. As a result, dispersal ability was lower for <b>selfed</b> than outcrossed seeds.
