50|$|The {{second of}} Limerick's River Shannon {{crossings}} {{is now called}} Sarsfield Bridge, to commemorate Patrick Sarsfield, the Earl of Lucan, who is renowned in Limerick {{for his role in}} the Williamite War and the 1691 siege and Treaty of Limerick in particular. The bridge was opened as Wellesley Bridge on 5 August 1835, following 11 years of construction. It was designed by the Scottish engineer Alexander Nimmo and based on the Pont de Neuilly in Paris. It was a particularly important development for the city as it allowed expansion to the northern shore of the river. The bridge itself consists of five large and elegant elliptical arches with an open balustrade, running from a man-made island, originally called Wellesley Pier but now known as Shannon Island, to the northern shore, and a simple flat, swivel deck with iron lattice railings crossing a canal and road from the island to what was known as Brunswick Street, now Sarsfield Street. The <b>swivel</b> <b>end</b> is no longer functional, although some of its heavy machinery is still intact underneath the roadway. A lock system has replaced the swivel section to allow for the passage of smaller boats. Apart from this, the bridge has remained largely unchanged since it opened and still has its original lamp standards.|$|E
5000|$|All {{models in}} the K series have an orange bag full {{indicator}} light, and the Vulcano and Premium models also have a green [...] "mains on" [...] / standby light. K1 models have a lightweight crushproof hose that <b>swivels</b> both <b>ends,</b> but the K3 Vulcano and Premium have a heavier electric hose that does not swivel at the machine end, so does {{tend to be a}} slightly more unwieldy in use.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the first}} Chromebit resembles a {{standard}} Chromebook laptop. The device features 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0, {{as well as}} a USB 2.0 port at one end. The other <b>end</b> <b>swivels,</b> enabling it to fit into a variety of HDMI slots.|$|R
50|$|The uni knot {{is widely}} used for {{attaching}} hooks, rings and <b>swivels</b> to the <b>end</b> {{of the line and}} it is also used for joining two fishing lines together. The bend form of the uni knot (for joining two lines) is not a noose; rather it is akin to a multiple fisherman's knot with the two opposing knotted parts arranged in the manner of uni knots.|$|R
50|$|The swivel sinker {{is similar}} to the plain one, except that instead of loops, there are <b>swivels</b> on each <b>end</b> to attach the line. This is a decided improvement, as it {{prevents}} the line from twisting and tangling. In trolling, swivel sinkers are indispensable. The slide sinker, for bottom fishing, is a leaden tube which allows the line to slip through it, when the fish bites. This is an excellent arrangement, as the fisherman can feel the smallest bite, whereas in the other case the fish must first move the sinker before the fisherman feels him.|$|R
5000|$|Fish stringer: Used {{to store}} speared fish while diving. Usually {{a length of}} cable, cord, string or {{monofilament}} terminated by a loop (and sometimes a <b>swivel)</b> at one <b>end</b> and a large stainless steel pin/spike at the other. The pin is typically 15-30 cm long, 4-8mm diameter, with a sharp point at one end, and with the cable threaded through a hole, usually in the middle, so the spike functions as a toggle once threaded. The pin can optionally {{be used as an}} iki jime spike, to dispatch speared fish. It can alternatively be a large, shaped loop of stainless steel. The stringer is usually attached to the dive float or around the waist of the diver.|$|R
40|$|Kiteboarding is {{an ocean}} sport wherein the participant, {{also known as}} a kiter, uses a large {{inflatable}} bow shaped kite to plane across the ocean on a surfboard or wakeboard. The rider is connected to his or her kite via a control bar system. This control system allows the kiter to steer the kite and add or remove power from the kite, in order to change direction and increase or decrease speed. This senior project focused on creating a new control bar system to replace a control bar system manufactured by a kiteboarding company, Liquid Force. The current Liquid Force control bar has two main faults, extraneous components and a lack of ergonomic design. Our team aimed to eliminate unneeded components and create a more ergonomic bar. By eliminating components, the bar would also be more cost effective to produce by using less material and requiring less time to manufacture. We first conducted a literature review into the areas of kiteboarding control systems and handle ergonomics. Based on studies done on optimal grip diameters for reducing forearm stress we concluded that the diameter for the bar grip should be at least a centimeter less than the maximum grip of the user. In addition to the literature review we conducted our own ergonomics surveys on fellow kite surfers regarding their preference towards the shape of the grip. Using ANOVA analysis, we found that riders preferred a bar with a less square center, but no clear preference on an oval shape versus a circular shape, so we decided on circular to minimize manufacturing and material costs. A functional decomposition was then employed on the current bar and a QFD analysis of each component was conducted. We found that 33 % of the components composed the plastic bar <b>end</b> <b>swivel.</b> We decided to remove the swivel system due to its lack of use and ergonomics. We then began the design process on the new bar ends and bar center. We went through two iterations of a smaller square center, choosing a center with chamfered edges to blend with the grip material. Our bar end design went through four iterations ranging from a simple angular boxy look, to a curved design which was more aesthetically and ergonomically pleasing. With SolidWorks models in hand, Mastercam toolpaths were built by our technical advisor, and we machined the bar ends and center out of aluminum billet. For the grip tubing we used carbon fiber tubing. By the end of manufacturing we had three different length bars to test in the ocean and we had reduced the bar part count from 31 parts to 13 parts. To justify the bars we created in terms of cost, we conducted economic comparisons between our bar design and the current bar. We concluded that Liquid Force would save $ 26, 105. 87 per year in labor and materials by switching to our bar and using casting processes for manufacturing. Due to the economic advantage and the new ergonomic design, we feel that Liquid Force should implement the design after further testing and refining. The bar performed without fault in our ocean test session, but we did find that improvements could be made in terms of grip ergonomics; the carbon surface was usable, but an EVA grip would give the user a softer, less slippery surface to steer with. We recommend that more long term testing be done to insure that the glue does not de-bond over time and that the carbon aluminum interface does not corrode. Continuing the project, we will research grip materials such as EVA, and create over molded bar grips and bar end covers...|$|R
