5|$|<b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> Flight 347 was a {{scheduled}} domestic flight which, on 3 November 1994, was hijacked shortly after take-off. The flight, from Bardufoss Airport via Bodø Airport to Oslo Airport, Fornebu in Norway, was {{operated by a}} McDonnell Douglas MD-82 belonging to <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (SAS). The hijacker was Haris Keč, a Bosnian living in Norway, who made demands that Norwegian authorities help to stop the humanitarian suffering in his home country caused by the Bosnian War. No one was injured in the incident.|$|E
5|$|SAS {{started as}} a {{cooperation}} between Norwegian Air Lines (DNL), Aerotransport (ABA), Swedish Intercontinental Airlines (SILA) and Danish Air Lines (DDL), who created Overseas <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (OSAS) in 1946 and European <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (ESAS) two years later. The airlines merged to create the SAS consortium in 1951. In the early years, SAS would rapidly purchase the newest intercontinental aircraft and gradually relegate them to European and then domestic service. The Caravelle was introduced in 1959 as SAS' first jetliner; intercontinental jet services commenced with the Douglas DC-8 the following year. The consortium created Scanair as a charter sister company in 1961. SAS Commuter was created in 1984 to operate regional airliners. The last such aircraft were retired in 2010. SAS bought its main competitors Linjeflyg of Sweden in 1993 and Braathens of Norway in 2001; the latter was merged to operate as SAS Braathens in Norway between 2004 and 2007.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1946 the {{airfield}} {{was used by}} civil aviation during the construction of nearby Heathrow Airport. During this period, Northolt became a major base for British European Airways, which used the nearby Bourne School as its headquarters.

5|$|Lysaker Station was {{the closest}} railway station to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. From 27 May 1990, <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> and the Norwegian State Railways started a {{cooperation}} to better the connection between rail and airline services. The project included the station being branded as Lysaker/Fornebu and dedicated shuttle buses running from the station to the airport terminal. NSB changed their scheduled so all InterCity Express and long distance trains on the Drammen Line started stopping at Lysaker.|$|E
5|$|The airline was {{established}} on 7 November 1960 as Grønlandsfly A/S by the <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (now SAS) and Kryolitselskabet Øresund, a Danish mining company {{involved with the}} cryolite operations at Ivittuut to provide transport and logistics for four American radar bases in Greenland. In 1962, interests in the firm were acquired by the Provincial Council (now the Greenland Home Rule Government) and the Royal Greenland Trade Department (now KNI).|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposal}} for an airport serving Ny-Ålesund was {{launched by the}} brothers Einar Sverre Pedersen and Gunnar Sverre Pedersen. Einar worked as chief navigator in the <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (SAS) and was instrumental in developing the airline routes over the North Pole. He envisioned that the airport in Svalbard could serve as an emergency landing aerodrome for intercontinental flights, and proposed that the Norwegian trunk airline service be extended to Svalbard.|$|E
25|$|The {{partnership}} with Skjelbred resulted in Agderfly seeking to establish {{itself as a}} scheduled airline. It applied in for concession to operate to Gothenburg from Kristiansand. This {{was rejected by the}} Ministry of Transport and Communications in 1986, citing <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System's</b> monopoly on inter-Scandinavian routes. However, the regulations were gradually being deregulated an on 13 November 1987 the airline was granted its concession.|$|R
25|$|The airline {{took the}} name Busy Bee of Norway A/S in 1980, {{at which time}} it also took {{delivery}} of a Boeing 737-200C. Regional services were introduced with <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>Systems</b> (SAS), followed by Fokker 50s entering service from 1988. Reduced military charters {{and a loss of}} a vital contract in 1991 caused the foundation to fall out of the airline and it filed for bankruptcy in December 1992. Key people and assets reestablished the airline as Norwegian Air Shuttle.|$|R
50|$|On March 7, 2013 Swissport International Ltd. (“Swissport”) and <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airline</b> <b>Systems</b> (“SAS”) {{announced}} that they signed a Letter of Intent. The letter creates the basis for continued negotiations between the two companies, aiming at an agreement to transfer full ownership of SAS Ground Handling in Denmark, Sweden and Norway to Swissport. As a first step, both parties intend to establish a joint venture company to which the business and operations of SAS Ground Handling and Spirit (cargo handling) will be transferred.|$|R
5|$|With Norway {{joining the}} European Economic Area, the Norwegian airline market was {{deregulated}} from 1 April 1994. While airlines formerly needed a concession from the Ministry of Transport {{to fly a}} particular route, they could now compete freely on any domestic or international routes. Previously the two major airlines <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (SAS) and Braathens SAFE each had their own routes, but from 1994 both established themselves on several of the main-haul routes.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{was carried}} out {{simultaneously}} at Banak, Alta Airport and Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, which combined would give Finnmark three primary airports. All three airports opened on 4 May 1963, while Tromsø Airport opened the following year. Services were at first operated by <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (SAS). At first the airline used 56-passenger Convair CV-440 Metropolitan aircraft, which flew flights south to Oslo in combination with flights to Alta and Kirkenes—from 1964 also to Tromsø. The general route scheme of flying multi-legged flights from Oslo to Finnmark would remain until 1990.|$|E
5|$|Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), {{previously}} {{known as}} <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System,</b> {{is the national}} airline of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

5|$|The {{destinations}} in Asia {{were served}} from 1949 to 1954. Then, Braathens became a domestic airline, {{and did not}} have international scheduled services again until 1987, except during part of 1960. From 1994, the airline market was deregulated, and Braathens was free to operate domestically and within the European Economic Area. In 1997, it bought Transwede and started domestic services in Sweden, but these were terminated in 1999. The company merged with the Norwegian division of <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (SAS) in 2004 to create SAS Braathens.|$|E
5|$|No primary {{airports}} {{had been}} built in Helgeland by the mid-1960s. The coastal parts of the region, such as at Brønnøysund, were without highways and railways. Although Widerøe operated a seaplane route, it remained a summer-only service. Travel time to Sandnessjøen, where the closest hospital was located, took five hours. A committee, led by Erik Himle and later Preben Munthe, was appointed in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft {{was about to be}} phased into use on the main domestic routes by <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners, including an airport in Sandnesssjøen.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE's {{domestic}} market was deregulated on 1 April 1994. Since then, any airline within the European Economic Area {{is free to}} operate any domestic or international route. Braathens rejected a proposal from the main competitor <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (SAS) for a merger; instead the helicopter division was sold and the company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. New routes were opened from Oslo Airport, Fornebu to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, but the routes from Bergen to these cities were terminated. International routes to Rome, Nice and Jersey were introduced. In 1996, Braathens SAFE bought Sweden's second-largest airline, Transwede, and started flying on the Oslo–Stockholm route. The following year, Transwede, with its five domestic routes, was merged into Braathens SAFE. The same year, KLM bought 30% of Braathens SAFE and the airlines started a partnership.|$|E
25|$|In October 1979, Norving {{started a}} route taxi service between Skien and Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik. Norving made an {{interlining}} agreement to allow {{passengers on the}} Skien to Kristiansand route to transfer to <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System's</b> Copenhagen flight, but low patronage caused the route was terminated in February 1981. Norving applied in the early 1980s for a concession on the route from Skien to Stavanger. This was granted on the condition the airline have a stopover at Farsund Airport, Lista. Norving started their route in May with two daily round trips using a Cessna 441 Conquest.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} European {{airlines}} also served the airport from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, including British Caledonian Airways with Boeing 707s, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines with Douglas DC-8s and Sabena, Swissair and UTA with these three air carriers all operating McDonnell Douglas DC-10s into Robertsfield. <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airline</b> <b>System</b> also served Monrovia, from Copenhagen.

5|$|The route had {{doubled its}} {{patronage}} since its introduction by 1953—the {{last year it}} was operated by DNL. From 1954 the route was taken over by Widerøe, who introduced smaller Noorduyn Norseman and de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter aircraft. The Widerøe seaplane service was flown on behalf of DNL and later <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (SAS) and remained until 1963. Varangfly—based in Kirkenes—was established in 1959 by general aviation enthusiasts from Kirkenes Flyklubb. The airline originally had two seaplanes, a two-seat Piper J-3 Cub and a five-seat Norsk Flyindustri C-5 Polar. Operations started on 17 June 1960. The company gradually developed services within scheduled, charter and air ambulance services. Varangfly later also bought an eight-seat land aircraft which was operated to Lakselv and Bardufoss, and to Ivalo Airport in Finland, where i corresponded with Finnair's service to Helsinki.|$|E
5|$|Use of {{the airport}} area as a {{civilian}} airport was launched by Varangfly director Odd Bentzen in 1964. After visiting Iceland he proposed a series of short and simple airports in Finnmark which could serve the airline's air ambulance service. A different proposal was launched in 1966 by several of the larger airlines, including <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System,</b> Braathens SAFE and Widerøe, to establish a network of short take-off and landing airports in rural areas; Berlevåg was one of six original proposals for Finnmark. A county committee was established in 1966 to look into building small airfields in Finnmark, including Berlevåg. In the following years the municipality made investments to allow the airfield {{to be used for}} air ambulance services. Part of the motivation was Berlevåg's poor port conditions, which often forced seaplanes to land at Kongsfjord.|$|E
5|$|Kosmos {{was bought}} by the Skaugen Group in 1988, and on 21 October, Kosmos' Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Bjørn Bettum and Chairman Otto Grieg Tidemand were fired. The Skaugen Group decided to {{integrate}} Kosmos' shipping and oil-related activities into their group. All other investments, including Norsk Air, were to be sold or closed. At the time, Norsk Air had 140 employees. Norsk Air's CEO, Mr. Røsjodet, made contact with Bård Mikkelsen, who was CEO of Widerøe, {{to try to convince}} them to purchase Norsk Air. Widerøe was a that time solely occupied with flying on the subsidized regional routes. The company was interested in having some non-subsidized routes to better benchmark its operations. The two largest owners, <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (SAS) and Braathens SAFE, did not want to purchase Norsk Air, but the third-largest owner, Fred. Olsen & Co. liked the idea, and bought SAS' and Braathens SAFE's 62.3 percent stake in Widerøe to make the deal possible. Other possible purchasers who had negotiated with Norsk Air were Sterling Airlines, Partnair and Jan Einar Johansen, former owner of Scandi Line.|$|E
50|$|Because of California's {{growth and}} tourist appeal, Golden West {{was able to}} become an {{interline}} partner {{with a number of}} domestic and international airlines.

500|$|The initial airport {{consisted}} of a [...] gravel runway and a spartan terminal consisting {{of no more than}} a shack. The airport opened on 17 May 1973 and Norving started an air taxi service using the eight-passenger Britten-Norman Islander. Grants of 3.5 million Norwegian krone (NOK) were issued from the state in 1981, which was supplemented with funding from Norving, the National Insurance Administration, Kommunalbanken and local interests. The new facilities opened in early 1983, consisting of a larger terminal and control tower and a lengthening of the runway—although it retained the gravel surface. The upgrades cost NOK5.8 million; they allowed Norving to operate a daily scheduled taxi route to Hammerfest and Alta, {{and for the first time}} Hasvik was able to receive same-day newspapers. The flights corresponded with <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System's</b> Oslo-flights at Alta Airport.|$|R
40|$|Sandra Vandermerwe {{is already}} a pioneer {{of the notion that}} {{including}} or extending services in a product portfolio adds value.

5|$|On 10 February, Bergen Aviation {{announced}} that they had applied the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration to operate a scheduled service between Flesland and Oslo Airport, Fornebu. At the time, <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (SAS) had a monopoly on the route, which was Norway's busiest, carrying 2,000 to 3,000 passengers per day. Einar Falck, Vesta's chief executive officer, stated that the mechanics' strike which had recently hit SAS had shown how vulnerable the SAS monopoly was. He further stated that should Bergen Aviation receive concession, they would acquire Boeing 737 or Douglas DC-9 aircraft for the route, and the owner group would consider listing the company. The application {{was part of a}} trend among smaller Norwegian airlines to apply for the new route. At the time there were 42 pending applications from 15 airlines awaiting decision in the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The Progress Party's Youth supported Bergen Aviation's application at its national convention.|$|E
5|$|Services were {{at first}} {{operated}} by <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (SAS). At the beginning the airline used 56-passenger Convair CV-440 Metropolitan aircraft, which flew flights south to Oslo and westward to Lakselv and Kirkenes—and also to Tromsø starting in 1964. The general route scheme of flying multi-legged flights from Oslo to Finnmark remained until 1990. On 7 April 1969, SAS introduced the 85-passenger Douglas DC-9-21 jetliner on the Alta service; the last Metropolitan flew on 1 April 1970. Five regional airports opened on 1 August 1974, Sørkjosen, Hammerfest, Mehamn, Berlevåg and Vadsø, all which {{were connected to}} Alta and other primary airports by Widerøe using de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. Honningsvåg Airport opened on 1 July 1977. SAS' traffic increased throughout the 1970s, resulting in SAS gradually increasing the frequency of its services, and later also using larger DC-9s. The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 was first flown on the Alta route on 11 July 1986.|$|E
5|$|By 1948, Braathens SAFE's routes were so regular {{that several}} {{countries}} stated that a bilateral agreement {{would have to}} be negotiated for them to continue. However, the concession that had been granted to DNL did not allow Braathens to fly any scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE applied for fifteen-year concession on 5 February 1948; Minister of Transport Nils Langhelle from the Labor Party knew that he would be violating DNL's concession by granting Braathens SAFE a concession, {{but at the same time}} he was worried that Braathens SAFE could easily flag out to another country, from which DNL would receive no protection. The exception in DNL's concession could not be used, since DNL declared that they, through the Scandinavian cooperation <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airlines</b> <b>System</b> (SAS), were planning to start a route to the far east. The Directorate for Civil Aviation stated that it was unlikely that DNL/SAS would start such a route within a few years, and recommended Langhelle that Braathens SAFE be granted the route. Concession was granted by the Norwegian Parliament on 3 February 1949, with a duration of five years. The airline had to follow the route Oslo or Stavanger – Amsterdam – Geneva – Rome – Cairo – Basra – Karachi – Bombay – Calcutta – Bangkok – Hong Kong. The concession was made conditional that Braathens SAFE built a technical base at Stavanger Airport, Sola.|$|E

We specialize on the <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airline</b> <b>System</b> (SAS) and German Lufthansa. Their flight prices were collected as primary data from the corresponding websites. We observed the following air travel services: Long-haul international, short-haul international and short-haul domestic; additionally, we differentiated price levels by the time of booking. Based on our findings we can say that the market segmentation model provides a good base for airlines. However, it has to be accompanied by additional strategies to react to arising problems (peak problem, currency fluctuation, etc). The patterns we found implemented by SAS and Lufthansa represent a firm market-responsive approach to the problems in the airline industry. < [...] ...|$|R
40|$|As part {{of their}} {{everyday}} marketing practice, companies contribute to perform their customers. This includes deciding upon and implementing strategies of approaching customers, be {{it in order to}} alert interest in the first place, to realise commercial exchanges, or to promote the repetition of such exchanges. An important part of the marketing process is also to create representations of these customers, e. g. in terms of surveys, loyalty programs, satisfaction indices, etc. Although continuously discussed within marketing departments, the question of who the customers are and what it is they demand is not as often given public attention. This paper follows the efforts to reduce the ambiguity of the customer concept during a legal controversy between <b>Scandinavian</b> <b>Airline</b> <b>Systems</b> and the Swedish Competition Authority in the Swedish Market court, the supreme national legal instance for market surveillance. The issue at stake is whether SAS, by applying their Frequent Flyer Program on domestic air travels in Sweden, is abusing their dominant position. During the proceedings, the character of the domestic airline customer becomes a central topic, and each party seeks to establish their version. It is suggested that the ambiguity surrounding the customer concept in the controversy can be attributed to differences between the model underlying the European competition law and the model underlying modern marketing practice...|$|R
