25|$|Driving Unger's {{political}} engagement is {{the idea}} that society can be made and remade. Unlike Mill or Marx, who posited a particular class as the agent of history, Unger does not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> vehicle for transformative politics. He advocates world-wide revolution, but does not see this happening as a single cataclysmic event or undertaken by a class agent, like the Communist movement. Rather, he sees the possibility of piecemeal change, where institutions can be replaced one at a time, and permanent plasticity can be built into the institutional infrastructure.|$|E

It also hosted many large concerts, and for a time, it held {{the record for the}} largest audience to ever <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> artist when a crowd of almost 57,000 witnessed a Led Zeppelin show in the facility in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{sought the}} {{services}} of Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya, who had replaced Zanardi at Chip Ganassi Racing in 1999, to step-in but Montoya was under contract to Ganassi for one more season. Britain's Jenson Button was called upon and made his debut instead. BMW Williams's first season did not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> victory during the season. They managed {{to get on the}} podium three times, with Ralf Schumacher responsible for all three. Williams finished third in the Constructors' Championship, with 36 points, one more than the prior year. Ralf Schumacher finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship, while Button, in his debut season, finished in eighth. Button made scrappy mistakes in early races (Monaco, Europe), but overall made an impressive debut in Melbourne, and continued to impress, notably at Silverstone, Spa and Suzuka.|$|E

25|$|Blair {{has stated}} that he would prefer to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> police force {{for the whole of}} London, an opinion shared by Ken Livingstone, with the {{functions}} of both the City of London Police and the British Transport Police absorbed by the Metropolitan Police. Already, the duties and functions of one police force (the Royal Parks Constabulary) have been taken by the Met. However, both the City of London Police and BTP have expressed their strong objections to this proposal, while the Home Office {{has stated that}} reorganisation of policing in London is not on their agenda. The publication of reviews into the operation of the British Transport Police, and the national review of fraud by the Attorney General, combined with the ending of the police merger proposals for England and Wales, appear to rule out any possibility of police mergers in London for the foreseeable future.|$|E
25|$|An augercast pile, often {{known as}} a {{continuous}} flight augering (CFA) pile, is formed by drilling into {{the ground with a}} hollow stemmed continuous flight auger to the required depth or degree of resistance. No casing is required. A cement grout mix is then pumped down the stem of the auger. While the cement grout is pumped, the auger is slowly withdrawn, conveying the soil upward along the flights. A shaft of fluid cement grout is formed to ground level. Reinforcement can be installed. Recent innovations in addition to stringent quality control allows reinforcing cages to be placed up to the full length of a pile when required. A typical reinforcing cage will consist of 4 to 8 bars from #5 to #8 bars typically 1/3 the length of the pile with longitudinal circular ties spaced {{along the length of the}} cage. Where tension loads are present it is typical to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> full length bar placed at the center of each pile.|$|E

2500|$|At the October 1992 Conservative Party Conference in Brighton, Tebbit embarrassed John Major's {{government}} {{when he made}} {{a speech}} attacking the Treaty. As he walked up onto the podium he was applauded by some sections of the audience, described as [...] "young, in t-shirts, aggressively self-confident – the lager louts of our party" [...] in the diary of the Conservative Party chairman of the time, Norman Fowler. Tebbit held aloft {{a copy of the}} Treaty and asked the conference a series of questions about the Treaty: did they want to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> currency or be citizens of a European Union? The audience shouted back [...] "No!" [...] after each question. Tebbit received a tumultuous standing ovation and walked into the centre of the conference hall waving amongst the cheers.

2500|$|Within a few months, {{the band}} {{convinced}} rising star Trent Reznor {{to produce the}} album instead. The abrasive sonic [...] "rawness" [...] that Mosimann's production had brought to such groups as Swans had failed to materialize on The Manson Family Album; Reznor and all the band's members thought it [...] "sucked", and was poorly representative of Marilyn Manson's dynamic live performances. In October 1993, Reznor agreed to fully commit to the project, taking them and their tapes to various studios in Los Angeles. With the help of Reznor and numerous live members of his band, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson re-recorded and reworked their old material until they were satisfied and released it under the name Portrait of an American Family. [...] "Snake Eyes and Sissies" [...] would never <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> release and in the album's credits Mosimann is credited as an engineer with no mention of his production work.|$|E
2500|$|... "Bitterglass" [...] {{was one of}} {{the earlier}} songs written for the album, while being one of Grant's {{favourite}} songs it is also seen by him as one of the darker songs on the record, and refers to the events of Jon Lee's suicide although Grant noted that it is also uplifting and gives an optimistic feeling in its chorus, while also giving a hypnotic feel alongside stating that the piano in the verses gives [...] "a kind of haunting melody". Other tracks on the album that did not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> release such as [...] "Morning Life" [...] was a track Grant wanted to be [...] "very atmospheric", and [...] "something that would be great when you are driving around in your car", while also wanting it to have a [...] "cinematic intro". Grant later claimed that [...] "Morning Life" [...] was a track many of the band's fans started to [...] "pick up on" [...] after buying the album, and also said [...] "another version is a possibility". [...] "Pilgrim Soul", the eighth track on the album was described by Grant as its most heaviest and said it will appeal to older fans. He said the album needed the track to [...] "give it a lift {{at the end of the}} record" [...] and that the [...] "sing-a-long chorus" [...] is what makes a song work. The chorus was explained as positive and the verses as dark, with the answer to the verses revealed in the chorus.|$|E
