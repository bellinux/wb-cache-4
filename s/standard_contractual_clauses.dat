Topic: Export of personal data to third countries, specifically non-E.U. countries which have not been recognised as having a data protection level that is adequate (i.e. equivalent {{to that of the}} E.U.). Both Commission Decisions provide a set of voluntary model clauses which can be used to export personal data from a data controller (who is subject to E.U. data protection rules) to a data processor outside the E.U. who is not subject to these rules or to a similar set of adequate rules.|$|E

Within the construction industry many parties are involved in projects. Those parties do mainly include the Client and the Contractor, in addition to the Project Manager, Project Consultant(s), Subcontractor(s) and Suppliers. Hence, Contracts needs to be customized, agreed, and signed to formalize parties’ relationships. Knowing that the Middle East region is, and will be, subject to major construction projects during the upcoming years, it is of major importance {{to understand the nature of}} <b>Standard</b> <b>Contractual</b> forms being used and the modifications that are being introduced noting that well configured <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses</b> would play major role in simplifying part of the complexity associated with the construction environment. The problem is that if the <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses</b> were not drafted responsibly or modifications to Standard forms were introduced without proper reasoning, contracts negotiation and signature would be a time consuming challenge and would take considerable time from the total originally allocated for the project. Furthermore, the project parties would be focusing on the contractual aspects, governing the project, leading to more claims i. e. fertile ground for contractual disputes, rather than technical and execution issues which would eventually flag hindrance in the project original schedule and certainly an escalation to the project original budget notwithstanding the project works atmosphere. The above issues represent a challenge to any responsible project party whose aim is to have his project executed noting the given time frame and allocated budget constraints. This paper focuses on the major modifications introduced to one of the mostly being used <b>standard</b> <b>contractual</b> form for the past 10 years in the Middle East, the Conditions of Contract for Works of Civil Engineering Construction (Red Book 4 th Edition 1987) one of the FIDIC Forms of Contracts, and it shows the impact and effect that the projects are experiencing due to the said major modifications as relayed through major industry practitioners. Of course, semi structured interviews and special tailored questionnaire surveys are the key to reveal how the major modifications would influence projects. The being assessed impact of the major modification to the standard conditions is presented in a quantitative way as they do relate to project duration and project cost...|$|R

Within the construction industry, many parties are involved in projects. Those parties mainly include the Client and the Contractor, in addition to the Project Manager, Project Consultant(s), Subcontractor(s) and Suppliers. Hence, contracts need to be customized, agreed, and signed to formalize parties’ relationships.

This research focuses on standard construction contracts in practice between 2005 and 2015, in the Middle East, with their corresponding conditions. The aim of this research is to investigate the major modifications originally introduced to provide additional immunity to a certain project party within the Middle East region to improve construction management performance. This is achieved by first reviewing the various international standard forms of contract, and general contractual issues, and then further investigating the reasons and implications of major modifications introduced to these standard forms of contract. A single case study is examined in this study, within which questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews are used as the data collection techniques. It is found that one of the most commonly used <b>standard</b> <b>contractual</b> forms between 2005 and 2015 in the Middle East is the Conditions of Contract for Works of Civil Engineering Construction 4 th Edition. The key findings highlight the reasons for the introduction of major modifications as being over protecting one of the parties or providing additional flexibility to one of the parties. Furthermore, the implications of introducing such modifications are identified as compounding the issues of project performance in terms of delays and cost escalation. This study recommends measures and modifications that would allow for contextual appropriateness, yet mitigate the impact of the same through the introduction of a proper balanced contract which is fit for purpose...|$|R

By eliminating exchange rate risk, EMU has eliminated a key obstacle to financial integration. But while a single currency is a necessary condition for the emergence of pan-European capital markets, it is not a sufficient one. Other frictions may still {{stand in the way of}} full integration: persistent differences in regulations applying to financial intermediaries, tax treatment, <b>standard</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses</b> and business conventions, issuance policy, security trading systems, settlement systems, availability of information, and judicial enforcement may still segment financial markets along national borders. In the process that preceded and accompanied the introduction of the euro, however, monetary unification triggered a sequence of policy actions and private sector responses that swept aside many other regulatory barriers to financial integration. To what extent has this process of regulatory reform led to actual financial integration? And if European financial markets have actually become more integrated, to what extent have these changes spurred growth and investment in Europe?

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{worldwide}} expansion of information networks the transnational exchange of personal data has grown considerably during the last decades. Thus the Member States of the European Union have increasingly lost their power to enforce national data protection laws and to protect the personal rights of their citizens. In order to curb this development the European Union has, in the course of harmonizing data protection on the internal market, sought to extend the reach of the Members' data protection laws by restricting the transfer of personal data to a third country by "Directive 95 / 46 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data". The present treatise examines the current legal instruments for ensuring such transnational protection of personal data exported from the European Union to third countries, in particular the USA. After a brief presentation of the circumstances under which Directive 95 / 46 /EC applies, its territorial scope is described. This already has a transnational impact and plays a decisive role in determining whether a specific transmission is subject to the provisions governing the transfer to third countries. Article 25 Section 1 of the Directive directly prohibits the transfer of personal data to a third country if the country of destination does not ensure an "adequate level of protection". Based on a specification of this criterion, the level of data protection provided by US law and the decision of the European Commission on the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles issued by the US Department of Commerce are elaborated. There follows a presentation of the exceptions detailed in Article 26 Section 1 of the Directive, which can legitimize the transfer of data to a third country which does not ensure an adequate level of protection. Finally, the Member States may permit a transfer of data to an insecure third country under Article 26 Section 2 if the controller of the processing provides adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of the privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Such safeguards may in particular result from appropriate contractual clauses or from corporate policies, so-called Codes of Conduct. In this respect the <b>standard</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses</b> adopted by the European Commission on 15 June 2001 and on 27 December 2001 have a special status. After a detailed analysis of these instruments, this treatise concludes that at present neither the scope nor the realization of the protection of personal data exported from the European Union into third countries meets the legal requirements of Directive 95 / 46 /EC. None the less, the growing awareness of data protection issues worldwide and constantly increasing competition are considered to justify a prognosis that the worldwide level of data protection wil...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe law {{in matters}} of {{consumer}} protection {{was born in the}} 18 th century, and started to develop {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century. In the period 1960 – 1970 European states like Sweden, Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, France adopted laws regarding the protection of consumer's rights. In Romania, such laws protecting the rights of consumers were adopted after th e Revolution in December 1989. Thus, the first laws on the matter were the Government Ordinance no. 21 / 1992 - which is presently applicable and Law no. 193 / 2000 also currently applicable although it was republished and modified. The specificity of the legislation in Romania is represented by the fact that the notion of “consumer” represents only the privat e person, the individual. The companies are assimilated to the professionals and are not protected against abusive <b>contractual</b> terms and <b>clauses.</b> Although the same private service can be granted and offered by the same company, the contract and its clauses will vary due to the quality of the contractor. If the contractor is a private person, a particular, he will be protected by law against abusive <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses,</b> while the contractor, which is a company will not be protected against the same <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses.</b> Thus, one and the same <b>contractual</b> <b>clause</b> cannot be abusive to the particular and legal to a company which is assimilated by the legislator to the professionals. In our opinion, this lack of protection regarding the professionals, the companies, not only represents a breech of the Romania's Constitution where in article 16, the fundamental right regarding the equality of all ci tizens in front of the law is being guaranteed, but it also represents a discrimination of the professionals...|$|R
