Random battles are played either with standard rules, or with <b>special</b> <b>limitations.</b> The Fog of War environmental effect is removed, and turns have limits of five minutes. In addition, Fates features Amiibo support, with compatible figurines being characters from earlier Fire Emblem games: when scanned, the character represented by a figurine will appear within My Castle, and after talking with them three times they can be fought in battle. When defeated, they become allies that join the main campaign. Talking with them prior to the fight gives the Avatar themed items, such as the mask of Fire Emblem Awakenings Lucina. Amiibo functions are unlocked after the narrative splits and My Castle is unlocked.|$|E
25|$|Acknowledging {{that the}} changes in the {{national}} economy in the past two hundred years had transformed Congress' Commerce Clause power from being a marginal power that served mostly to mediate between the states by eliminating interstate tariffs and other burdens on interstate commerce into a general power that gave Congress essentially unlimited power to regulate in every area of economic life, O'Connor argued for <b>special</b> <b>limitations</b> on this power to protect the states' authority over their own employment relations. She invoked the limiting language of the most expansive interpretations of the Commerce Clause in the Court's decisions of the 1930s and 1940s to argue that the Court retained the power to decide whether a particular exercise of the Commerce Clause authority was necessary and proper to the federal purposes to be achieved. Applying that standard, she, joined by Justices Powell and Rehnquist, would find the FLSA unconstitutional as applied to employees of state and local governments.|$|E
500|$|The {{publication}} of James Edward Austen-Leigh's A Memoir of Jane Austen in 1869 introduced Austen {{to a wider}} public as [...] "dear aunt Jane", the respectable maiden aunt. Publication of the Memoir spurred the reissue of Austen's novels – the first popular editions were released in 1883 and fancy illustrated editions and collectors' sets quickly followed. Author and critic Leslie Stephen described the popular mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as [...] "Austenolatry". In 1878, the French critic Léon Boucher published the essay Le Roman Classique en Angleterre, where he called Austen a [...] "genius", {{which was the first}} time that epithet had been used in France to describe Austen. The first proper translation of Austen into French that was completely faithful to the original occurred in 1899 when Félix Fénéon translated Northanger Abbey into French as Catherine Moreland. Around the start of the 20th century, members of the literary elite reacted against the popularisation of Austen. They referred to themselves as Janeites in order to distinguish themselves from the masses who did not properly understand her works. For example, Henry James responded negatively to what he described as [...] "a beguiled infatuation" [...] with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's [...] "intrinsic merit and interest". The American literary critic A. Walton Litz noted that the [...] "anti-Janites" [...] in the 19th and 20th centuries comprise a formidable literary squad of Mark Twain, Henry James, Charlotte Bronte, D.H. Lawrence and Kingsley Amis, but in [...] "every case the adverse judgement merely reveals the <b>special</b> <b>limitations</b> or eccentricities of the critic, leaving Jane Austen relativity untouched".|$|E

5000|$|Apart {{from general}} {{limitation}} of this kind, {{there is also a}} <b>special</b> <b>limitation</b> clause to consider. Section 32(2) permits the national legislation that gives effect to the constitutional right to [...] "provide for reasonable measures to alleviate the administrative and financial burden on the state." [...] This language [...] "seems not to serve the function of demarcation but actually to grant the legislature additional scope to limit the right of access to information." [...] However, this scope is granted {{only to the extent that}} particular provisions of PAIA are designed to [...] "alleviate the administrative and financial burden on the state." [...] The provision relating to fees [...] "would surely qualify," [...] but the Cabinet exemption [...] "arguably would not," [...] and would thus not be justified by the <b>special</b> <b>limitation.</b>|$|R
40|$|The 2002 Ipp Review of the Law of Negligence {{recommended}} {{the enactment of}} a <b>special</b> <b>limitation</b> period for the commencement of personal injuries litigation in cases where a child is injured by a parent or {{a person who is}} in a 'close relationship' with the child’s parent. A person would be in such a relationship with a child’s parent if he or she had a relationship with the child's parent, such that the child's parent might be influenced not to bring an action on the child's behalf (the first limb of the definition); or, if the person's relationship with the child's parent was such that the child might be unwilling to disclose the relevant acts (the second limb of the definition). In recommending this <b>special</b> <b>limitation</b> period, the Ipp Report appeared to acknowledge features of some classes of child abuse cases which make a standard personal injuries limitation period unjustifiable. Following this recommendation, New South Wales and Victoria enacted legislative changes which aim to give survivors of child abuse perpetrated by a parent or a person classed as a 'close associate' of a parent a justifiable period of time in which to institute personal injuries proceedings. This article discusses the Ipp Report's recommendations regarding the <b>special</b> <b>limitation</b> period and the reasons given for those recommendations, which are largely motivated by psychological evidence concerning the effects of child abuse. It then outlines the legislative provisions in New South Wales and Victoria, which embody the essence of the Ipp recommendations. The article then consults evidence of the psychological effects of child sexual abuse, and studies of non-disclosure and delayed disclosure by survivors of child sexual abuse, to inform an assessment of the conceptual basis of the second limb of the close associate provision. Using the psychological evidence and empirical evidence of disclosure and non-disclosure as analytical tools, this article will argue that the second limb of the close associate provision would be better predicated not on the tortfeasor's perceived relationship with the child’s parent, but {{on the nature of the}} acts and circumstances of abuse and their impact on the child's willingness to disclose their abuse. The article is of particular relevance to New South Wales and Victoria, but, given the desirability and likelihood of other Australian jurisdictions enacting a <b>special</b> <b>limitation</b> period for child abuse cases, it is also relevant to the rest of Australia...|$|R

For the simple bracketed languages having <b>special</b> <b>limitations,</b> the equivalence problem is decidable. We obtain the sufficient conditions for the representation some language by special sequences of simple bracketed languages. We also consider the examples of grammatical structures as the simple bracketed languages.

40|$|AbstractThe {{notion of}} joint actions {{provides}} a natural execution {{model for a}} specification language, when temporal logic of actions is used for formal reasoning. We extend this basis with scheduling, the role {{of which is to}} enforce liveness properties and to introduce real-time properties. This is done in a way that agrees with the partial-order view of computations and can be applied already {{in the early stages of}} specification and design. This leads to distinguishing between schedulings that are totally correct, partially correct, or incorrect with respect to liveness properties. A general scheduling policy of durational actions is formulated from which any reasonable scheduling can be obtained by reducing its nondeterminism. When this policy is totally correct for a system and gives the required real-time properties, no <b>special</b> <b>limitations</b> are imposed on the implementation. The approach also leads to a general classification of real-time models according to the permitted interactions between the computational state and real time...|$|E
