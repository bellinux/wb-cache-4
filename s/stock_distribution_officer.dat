40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{three issues}} regarding {{the effects of}} <b>stock</b> <b>distributions</b> on returns, volatility, and prices {{in an attempt to}} answer the questions why firms execute <b>stock</b> <b>distributions</b> and why the market appears to favor them. These questions have occupied academicians for at least 40 years (i. e., Fama et al (1969), Ohlson and Penman (1985), Rankine and Stice (1997), Angel (1997), and Crawford et al (2005) among many others). ^ Chapter 1 studies the notion that the stock market reacts more positive to stock dividends than to stock splits (Rankine and Stice, 1997). However, I find that the stock market does not differentiate between stock splits and stock dividends. Although, I do find some differences in announcement returns, depending on which state the firm that announces a distribution is located in. Specifically, firms located in states where there are restrictions on cash dividends (i. e., dividend can only be paid from retained earnings) exhibit differences in announcement returns consistent with the retained earnings hypothesis. Chapter 2 investigates volatility increases that are observed after the execution of a <b>stock</b> <b>distribution</b> (Ohlson and Penman, 1985). I show that the increase in volatility appears to be caused by the relationship between the price and bid-ask bounce effects associated with minimum tick size. Chapter 3 studies the prediction made by Angel (1997) that average stock prices will decrease over time due to decreases in minimum tick size, which promotes execution of <b>stock</b> <b>distributions.</b> I show that this prediction has not come true, yet. Moreover, I find the average stock price has increased (not decreased) while the <b>stock</b> <b>distribution</b> frequency has decreased. ...|$|R
40|$|Management Council (PFMC) {{received}} public {{testimony in}} early 2015 requesting evaluation {{of an alternative}} management boundary within California’s portion of the Klamath Management Zone (KMZ). Industry representatives have suggested that Chinook <b>stock</b> <b>distribution</b> and associated ocean fishery harvest rates may differ between the Crescent City and Eureka port areas. West-coast ocean salmon fishery management is spatially and temporally structured to allow for weak stock management. In the KMZ, the Klamath River fall Chinook (KRFC) age- 4 ocean harvest rate, which {{is used as a}} proxy for ESA-listed California Coastal Chinook, frequently limits access to more abundant stocks (e. g., Sacramento River fall Chinook [SRFC]). Ideally, geographical fishery management boundaries are selected based on <b>stock</b> <b>distribution</b> and fishery contacts, enabling effective weak stock management.

40|$|We offer a new {{anchoring}} {{explanation for}} the ex-day abnormal returns of <b>stock</b> <b>distributions</b> including <b>stock</b> dividend <b>distributions,</b> splits, and reverse splits. We propose that investors tend to anchor on cum-day prices in valuating ex-distribution stocks, resulting in a positive association between ex-day returns and adjustment factors. We find that this positive return-factor relation exists for all three types of <b>stock</b> <b>distributions</b> and in both the pre- and post-decimalization periods. Furthermore, we find that this positive return-factor relation is more pronounced among events that are more subject to investors’ anchoring propensity, featured by less investor attention, greater arbitrage difficulty, greater valuation uncertainty, less investor sophistication, and higher market sentiment. Lastly, using brokerage account data, we show that stocks that are traded by investors with more investment experience demonstrate a weaker return-factor relation...|$|R

We hypothesise that the bull market affected the value and credibility of signals from management. These changes in the quality of the signals changed the association between the predistribution share price and the market's response to the distribution, which altered the GMT result.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} market {{valuation}} {{of an unusual}} form of free <b>stock</b> <b>distributions</b> called bonus issues which are mainly financed by the revaluations of assets equity reserve in an inflationary economic setting. We detect positive excess return on the announcement day for these bonus issues similar to the market reaction to stock dividends and splits in developed and emerging markets. In an institutional environment where cash dividend substitution effect, agency cost effect, transaction cost effect and retained earnings effect are not present, we find empirical support for the enhanced liquidity hypothesis, but interestingly, no support for the attention getting hypothesis and the signaling hypothesis which is the predominant explanation for the positive market reaction to the <b>stock</b> <b>distributions</b> in developed capital markets. We also provide a unique explanation for bonus issues as corporations need to increase their eroding paid-in capital in an inflationary environment {{in order to have}} a better debt to paid-in capital ratio for more credibility and borrowing capacity in a market of limited access to external equity financing.

40|$|SummaryBackground/ObjectiveSpatial {{knowledge}} of the anatomy of the proximal humerus is critical for effective treatment, particularly in patients affected by fragility fractures. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) imaging with medical image processing techniques enable three dimensional (3 D) analysis of volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) of bones of different sizes and shapes. MethodsTo elucidate the bony anatomy and to create 3 D reference data, we conducted a computerized HR-pQCT-based study in intact postmortem samples of the proximal humerus to highlight the anatomy with particular emphasis on the size, shape, and bone <b>stock</b> <b>distribution</b> pattern. Fifty-eight defrozen intact humerus samples from 28 female and 30 male donors, who were aged 61 – 98 years old (mean age ± standard deviation, 80. 6  ±  9 years), were scanned in the proximal third using the extended standard HR-pQCT protocol. A 3 D statistical bone and averaged bone density models with low, middle, and high total vBMDs were computed. We examined the 3 D patterns of size and shape variations using principal component analysis, and the vBMD distributions and variabilities using volume-rendering and virtual bore probing. ResultsThe computer models revealed a highly variable bony anatomy in which size was the predominant variation in the first principal component (PC). In the second PC, we observed notable variabilities {{in the shape of}} the head and shaft inclination. A distinct 3 D pattern of bone <b>stock</b> <b>distribution</b> was detected in which the lowest vBMD values were identified in the medullary cavity, middle values were identified in the central zone, and the highest values were identified in the cortex and humeral head—particularly in the subarticular zones. In the presence of bone loss, the vBMD values were ubiquitously decreased, but the pattern of 3 D bone <b>stock</b> <b>distribution</b> was maintained. ConclusionThe new anatomical 3 D data that we acquired will improve the understanding of the normal bony anatomy of the proximal humerus. The extended HR-pQCT protocol and computer models may be used for other skeletal sites and used as 3 D reference models that can be applied to systematically improve implant design and anchorage...|$|R
