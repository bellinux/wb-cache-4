5|$|Mosses and lichens now cover {{much of the}} island. During the island's first 20years, 20species {{of plants}} were {{observed}} {{at one time or}} another, but only 10 became established in the nutrient-poor <b>sandy</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric curium {{compounds}} {{are poorly}} soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 4,000 times higher concentration of curium at the <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> particles than in water {{present in the}} soil pores. An even higher ratio of about 18,000 was measured in loam soils.|$|E
5|$|Box {{huckleberry}} prefers dry, acidic soils, including duff, {{and partial}} shade. Locations on wooded slopes tend to face north; however, the New Bloomfield site faces west. At {{one of the}} Delaware sites, {{a small portion of}} the colony extended to the wet margin of a marsh, but most was located on dry, <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> upslope.|$|E
40|$|In Vietnam, <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> are {{distributed}} {{mainly in the}} coastal central provinces where they occupy 337, 768 ha comprising 63 % of the nation’s <b>sandy</b> <b>soils,</b> and they are also important to regional economic growth where more than 10 million people are living i. e. 14 % of the Vietnamese population. The sandy materials in the central coastal Vietnam originate from mostly in situ weathering of granite although aeolian sediments are parent materials for <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> also. <b>Sandy</b> <b>soils</b> have {{a wide range of}} limiting factors for agricultural production, including nutrient deficiencies, acidity, low water holding capacity and wind erosion risk (on coastal dunal sands). Although there are soil fertility constraints to the use of <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> in Vietnam, 79, 076 ha has been utilized in agriculture. Developing integrated nutrient management practices are needed to improve soil physical, chemical and biological fertilities of <b>sandy</b> <b>soils.</b> For example, systematic use of farmyard manures, crop residues, green manures, and alley cropping need to be considered. Developing integrated nutrient management practices also need to address environmental considerations by matching nutrient applications to crop needs and amending soils to minimise nutrient losses to water. Developing new soil management technologies (such as use of biochar, slow release fertilisers and minimum tillage) is also important for sustainable management of <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> in Vietnam...|$|R

5|$|For {{almost two}} decades after its discovery, Psilocybe tampanensis was known only from the type locality, {{southeast}} of Brandon, Florida. In 1996, Guzmán reported finding it in a meadow with <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> in a deciduous forest in Pearl River County, Mississippi, a habitat {{similar to that of}} the type location. Due to its scarcity, however, its habitat preferences are not known with certainty. Like all Psilocybe species, it is saprobic.|$|E
5|$|Gymnopilus flavus, despite also {{appearing}} on land near the Mediterranean, can be differentiated from G.maritimus as it lives among grass, especially Dactylis glomerata, {{and it has}} distinctly smaller spores, typically measuring 5 to 6 by 3.5 to 4.2μm. G.pseudofulgens, also collected in Italy, shows two major morphological differences: it produces smaller mushrooms, and spores that are of a different shape with smaller warts. G.decipiens, another species that grows on <b>sandy</b> <b>soil,</b> again has spores that are markedly different. The American species G. arenicola also favours <b>sandy</b> <b>soil,</b> but has significantly smaller spores than G.maritimus. Two other species of Gymnopilus found around the Mediterranean are G.corsicus and G.spadiceus. G.corsicus has no veil remnants on the stem, and spores that do not turn red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine, and so can easily be differentiated from G.maritimus. G.spadiceus shows several similarities to G.maritimus, but grows only on pine wood and has rectangular spores.|$|E
5|$|In other regions, {{the average}} {{radioactivity}} of surface soil due to residual americium {{is only about}} 0.01picocuries/g (0.37mBq/g). Atmospheric americium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 1,900 times higher concentration of americium inside <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> particles than in the water present in the soil pores; an even higher ratio was measured in loam soils.|$|E

5|$|This {{species has}} been {{reported}} to grow solitary or in groups on <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> or rich composted soil in both mixed and coniferous forests, often beneath cedars. In Hawaii, it is usually found growing in duff under coastal Casuarina and groves of Cupressus. The species has been noted to occur in late summer and autumn (in Britain and Europe), but the fruit bodies may dry and persist for some time.|$|E
5|$|A {{long-lived}} plant {{reaching an}} age of up to 60 years, I.anemonifolius resprouts from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, after bushfire. Seedlings appear in the year following a fire. Although I.anemonifolius was collected by Daniel Solander in 1770, it was not described until 1796 by Richard Salisbury. Several varieties have been named, though none are now recognised as distinct. It was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1791. I.anemonifolius grows readily in the garden if located in a sunny or part-shaded spot with <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> and good drainage.|$|E
5|$|For an {{ecosystem}} to support ticks, it must satisfy two requirements: the population density of host {{species in the}} area must be high enough, and humidity must be high enough for ticks to remain hydrated. Due to their role in transmitting Lyme disease, ixodid ticks, particularly the North American I.scapularis, have been studied using geographic information systems to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. According to these studies, certain features of a given microclimate – such as <b>sandy</b> <b>soil,</b> hardwood trees, rivers, {{and the presence of}} deer – were determined to be good predictors of dense tick populations.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} the {{spatial and temporal}} dynamics of forest and vineyard areas {{in the last three}} decades in areas occupied by <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> in southern Oltenia. Areas with <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> in this zone are considered vulnerable elements of the environment as a result of deflation phenomenon that occurs after the disappearance of vegetation. It is therefore necessary to analyze the current state of <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> covered by forest vegetation and vineyards, these two categories of vegetation playing a vital role in their stabilization. The results obtained show that in the last three decades forest areas decreased by approx. 2700 ha (11. 6 %) being replaced by <b>sandy</b> <b>soils,</b> while vineyards areas have diminished with 22 % (1638 ha), with negative consequences of ecological, climatic and social natur...|$|R

50|$|In New South Wales {{the species}} is {{recorded}} on dry western slopes on acidic <b>sandy</b> <b>soils,</b> as far west as the Parkes district. It is found on <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> {{at the southern end}} of Seven Mile Beach National Park on the south coast. It also recorded in the Australian Capital Territory.|$|R
5|$|It {{shares the}} same nesting biology as S.speciosus. All cicada killers are ground-nesting insects and nest aggregations can contain up to {{hundreds}} of nests, each with a single provisioning female. Their tunnel is mainly made in well-drained, bare <b>sandy</b> <b>soil,</b> frequently under sidewalks, but is generally in full sunlight. Approximately 90% of its life is spent underground as a larva. It rarely infests grounds that are rich in vegetation {{in order for them}} to get more sun. Mounds are easily recognizable by their distinctive U-shaped digging entrance.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the easier}} Western species to grow, Banksia lemanniana has some horticultural {{potential}} in its attractive chocolate buds, green-yellow hanging flower spikes and large grey spikes with prominent follicles. It generally grows quite quickly, but nevertheless takes {{five to six}} years to flower from seed. It prefers a more alkaline rocky or <b>sandy</b> <b>soil,</b> with a nominal pH range from 6 to 7.5. It favours a sunny position and good drainage, and has been successfully cultivated in more humid climates on Australia's east coast. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 43 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{and animals}} include those {{generally}} common to Central Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute {{one-third of the}} forests; conifers are increasing {{as a result of}} reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in <b>sandy</b> <b>soil.</b> There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver. The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sandy</b> <b>soils</b> {{are often}} {{considered}} as soils with physical properties that are easily defined, however {{they are far}} from being simple. This is particularly the case for <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> in the tropics where they are subjected to a cycle of wetting and drying associated with seasonality. In this respect small changes in composition lead to significant differences of physical properties. One of the major soil characteristics {{to be taken into}} account is the size distribution of the sand grains. If fine sand induces greater porosity, water retention and resistance to penetration than coarse sand, they exhibit lower permeability. Porosity decreases when the heterogeneity of the sand grain distribution increases leading to an increase in resistance to penetration and decreases in permeability. The presence of silt particles leads to similar consequences. Thus, silty sands are more compact than <b>sandy</b> <b>soils,</b> most silt particles occupying the voids between sand grains thereby reducing porosity and consequently permeability. Size distribution and mineralogy of silt and clay sized particles that are associated with sand grains are also responsible for variations in physical properties of tropical <b>sandy</b> <b>soils.</b> Under tropical environments, <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> undergo significant weathering to depth thus resulting in a mineralogy where quartz the dominant mineral in the sand and silt fraction and forms a significant proportion of the clay sized fraction. On the other hand, <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> can be present in the lower part of the landscape where clays or salts form during the dry season. As a consequence, <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> with similar particle size distribution but due to differences in mineralogy of the clay sized fraction that represents not more than a few percent of th...|$|R
5|$|The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is {{an annual}} {{herbaceous}} legume from the genus Vigna. Due to its tolerance for <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> and low rainfall {{it is an}} important crop in the semi-arid regions across Africa and other countries. It requires very few inputs, as the plants root nodules are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable crop for resource poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with other crops. The whole plant is used as forage for animals, with its use as cattle feed likely responsible for its name.|$|E
5|$|The gardens {{surrounding}} the museum cover about 100 hectares. They {{were designed by}} the French landscape architect and botanist Édouard André (1840–1911) and his son Rene Eduard Andre, assisted by the Belgian gardener Buyssen de Coulon. Local historians have estimated that they originally contained about 500 varieties of trees and shrubs, some brought from gardens in Berlin. About 250 imported and 370 native plant species are now represented at the park; 24 of these are included in Lithuania's 1992 list of endangered species. Pine and fir trees adapted to the <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> predominate.|$|E
5|$|The rocky cliffs, common {{features}} downstream of the Minho's estuary, disappear in Póvoa de Varzim, {{giving way to}} a coastal plain. The plain {{is located in a}} cuspate foreland, an old marine plateau from the Plio-Pleistocene, conferring a <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> to the coastal lands. The sand dunes in the Northwestern coast formed during the Little Ice Age and started piling up in the 15th or 16th century. Wandering along the coast one discerns Cape Santo André, the tip of the cuspate foreland and the Avarus Promontory, referred to by Ptolemy.|$|E

5|$|The {{species has}} been found only on coastal sand dunes near Olbia, in Sardinia, where it was {{observed}} growing {{at the base of}} Juncus maritimus (the sea rush), between the winter months of October and January. However, there is speculation that it may also grow elsewhere in Europe. Mushrooms were seen growing from both the <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> and decaying plants; however, as a saprotrophic feeder, {{it is possible that the}} species would be able to grow on other substrates. The mushrooms grow in close groups or tight tufts.|$|E
5|$|These ants live in nests in <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> which {{sometimes}} have a mound, which resembles a molehill. M. nigrocincta ants labor to conceal their nests using twigs and leaves. Depending {{on the type}} of habitat in which the colony is located, they decorate the nest with plant material and gravel. Other materials that are used to camouflage M. nigrocincta colonies include dry leaves, rocks, vegetation, and twigs. Nests are beside a clump of grass or bush or {{at the base of a}} tree.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra esculenta {{grows on}} <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> in Temperate {{coniferous}} forest and occasionally in deciduous woodlands. Among conifers {{it is mostly}} found under pines (Pinus spp.), but also sometimes under aspen (Populus spp.). The hunting period is from April to July, earlier than for other species, and the fungus may even sprout up with the melting snow. It can be abundant in some years and rare in others. The mushroom is more commonly found in places where ground has been disturbed, such as openings, rivulets, washes, timber clearings, plowed openings, forest fire clearings, and roadsides. Enthusiasts in Finland have been reported burying newspaper inoculated with the fungus in the ground in autumn and returning the following spring to collect mushrooms.|$|E
