5|$|There {{are obvious}} {{connections}} {{in the design of}} the Slaying of Holofernes and the Slaying of Haman at the opposite end of the chapel. Although in the Holofernes picture the figures are smaller and the space less filled, both have the triangular space divided into two zones by a vertical wall, allowing us to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> happening on both sides of it. There are actually three scenes in the Haman picture because as well as seeing Haman punished, we see him at the table with Esther and the King and get a view of the King on his bed. Mordechai sits on the steps, making a link between the scenes.|$|E

5|$|Under the 1977 Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was {{the head}} of {{government}} and the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet {{was the head}} of state. The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was comparable to a prime minister in the First World, whereas the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was comparable to a president in the First World. In the Soviet Union's seventy-year history there was no official leader of the Soviet Union office, but during most of that era there was a de facto top leader who usually led the country through the office of the Premier or the office of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). In the ideology of Vladimir Lenin the head of the Soviet state was a collegiate body of the vanguard party (<b>see</b> <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> to Be Done?).|$|E

Jang is purported to have replied, “The ancients had a saying, ‘To <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> right and {{not to do it}} is want of courage.’ Though I am without ability, I shall follow your orders.” Thereupon Jang dispatched a force of 5000 men under the command of his closest companion and adviser Jeong Yeon (who had since also returned from Tang) in support of Sinmu's claim. The success of Sinmu's power grab won Jang Bogo the post of Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|First, the {{movement}} system (and turn structure with it) departs {{from the traditional}} 'everyone takes a turn in order' structure used {{in the vast majority}} of games. Instead a proportional movement system is used, where a little bit of the total movement (termed an impulse, 32 of which comprise each game turn) for all players is resolved simultaneously, so that each can <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> happening and respond to it. This avoids the usual problems with moving long distances without any fire or reactions happening, and keeps in mind that everything is moving at the same time. This system produces two important and well-known effects for movement: on impulse #1 of the game turn no units move (starships are restricted to speed 31 or less) and on impulse #32 (the last) all units move. The former instance means that speed-32 seeking weapons one hex from their targets hit automatically without possibility of interception, and targets at the range limit of overloaded torpedoes (8 hexes) cannot escape before taking fire. The latter instance means that even the slowest units in play make a move on the turn's final impulse.|$|E
25|$|Played mid-credits, Amy (Elizabeth Banks) {{worries that}} her boyfriend Anson's (Josh Duhamel) cat, Beezel (an {{animated}} cartoon), is coming between their relationship. Beezel seems to detest Amy {{and anyone who}} comes between him and Anson, but Anson only sees Beezel as innocent. One day, Amy witnesses Beezel masturbating to summer vacation photos of Anson in a swimsuit. Beezel attacks her and violently urinates on her. Anson still finds his pet innocent but Amy threatens to leave if he doesn't get rid of Beezel. Caring more about his relationship, Anson agrees {{to find a new}} home for him. That night, from a closet, Beezel tearfully watches the couple make love (whilst sodomizing himself with a hairbrush and dry humping a stuffed teddy bear). The next day {{when it comes time to}} take Beezel away, he is nowhere to be found. Amy goes outside to look. Beezel then runs her over with a truck and attempts to shoot her to death with a shotgun, but she chases him into the street and begins beating him with a shovel, which is witnessed by a group of children attending a birthday party at a neighboring house. When Anson approaches to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> happening, Amy tries to explain Beezel's motives. Beezel acts innocent and Anson sides with his cat. The children of the party then attack and murder Amy for beating up Beezel, stabbing her with plastic forks. Anson grabs Beezel, as Beezel again fantasizes about French kissing his owner.|$|E

Vince Zampella, creative director of Infinity Ward, said, [...] "We didn't want to take any of the parts out that made Call of Duty so good. But {{there were a couple of}} things that we admit could have been done better". A demo of the game showed a more open gameplay style and a better AI for the enemies, who would actively go after the player. There are a set number of enemies set on the map that will begin reacting to the player's presence once the first shot has been fired. Groups of enemies farther away send units up to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> happening and add to the combat while enemies directly in front of the player will join in and take cover quickly.|$|E

I have been saying all the time that what I wanted was text rather than subtext – but in end, I think the subtext did actually pay off." ...|$|E
500|$|For Bennion, it was [...] "a {{credit to}} the two creators that they can pack in such a depth of emotion into 29 minutes". Similarly, Wilson praised the writers for {{achieving}} [...] "genuine poignancy" [...] in half an hour, and critics in the Metro said that the episode [...] "packs more drama and suspense into 30 minutes than many a five-part series". Mulkern said the episode was a [...] "superb piece of drama, imbued with an increasing sense of dread". The story's ending was praised, with Dessau saying that [...] "One of the skills of actor/writers Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton {{is the way they}} plant seeds and gradually leak out details. They do it so expertly here that one really doesn't <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> coming." [...] McDowall expressed a similar thought, saying that the [...] "writers so cleverly threw us off the scent, making the eventual realisation so agonising".

500|$|Lim {{expressed}} concerns about a proposed constitutional amendment introduced in April 2010 {{that would allow}} magistrates to hear what are called [...] "first mentions" [...] through video conferencing. A first mention is a hearing that must be held within 48 hours of a person's arrest. She felt it failed to adequately assure accused people that {{they were allowed to}} complain to magistrates about injuries they had sustained or acts of misfeasance against them by the authorities. In response, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng assured MPs that processes would be in place to ensure that accused people are treated fairly. For example, during a video conference, an accused person will be alone in a room with no police officer, and will be able to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> happening in the entire courtroom. Secondly, the screen that will be used by the judge is large enough to enable him or her to clearly see whether the accused is under duress. Finally, accused people who have been mistreated can either complain to the police or to the judge when they are later present in court.|$|E
500|$|Episodes {{were written}} {{by a team of}} writers, which {{consisted}} of Dohrn, David Fain, Greenblatt, Mr. Lawrence, Lender, Mark O'Hare, Povenmire, William Reiss, Springer, Tibbitt, and Merriwether Williams. During the season, the writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for individual episodes. For example, in the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", SpongeBob learns profanity. The idea for the episode was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience [...] " [...] I got in trouble for saying the f-word in front of my mother." [...] Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life." [...] The end of the episode, where Mr. Krabs uses more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was also inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself." [...] In [...] "Secret Box", SpongeBob wants to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> inside Patrick's secret box. The idea came to Drymon because he too had a secret box as a child. Creator Hillenburg said, [...] " [...] started telling us about it. We wanted to make fun of him and use it." ...|$|E

Mickey is convinced and leaves for the hospital. Corky tells Caesar where she has hidden the money, and he goes next-door to find it.

In the meantime, Corky tries to stop Caesar from taking the money, but he beats her to the ground. Just as he is about to kill her, Violet arrives and pulls a gun on Caesar, telling him that Mickey is on his way and that he should run while he can.

Accordingly, Offitt sneaks into Farnham's house with Sleeny's hammer, but just as he is striking the fatal blow, Alice Belding, who can <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on from her house through an opera glass, screams, distracting Offitt enough so that Farnham is hurt by the blow, but not killed. Offitt hurries away with the money, and proceeds to frame Sleeny. [...] After realizing Offitt's treachery, Sleeny escapes jail and kills him. [...] The stolen money is found on Offitt's body, clearing Sleeny in the assault on Farnham, but the carpenter must still stand trial for the killing of Offitt, in which he is aided by partisan testimony from Maud. [...] A sympathetic jury ignores the law to find him not guilty. [...] Sleeny wins Maud's hand in marriage, and Farnham and Alice Belding are to be wed.|$|E
500|$|In 2007 the duo fronted the UK {{version of}} Apple Inc.'s [...] "Get a Mac" [...] adverts, with Mitchell playing PC. The adverts {{received}} much criticism. Writing in The Guardian, Charlie Brooker {{claimed that the}} use of Mitchell and Webb in the adverts was a curious choice. He compared the characters of PC and Mac in the adverts to those of Mark and Jeremy in Peep Show, stating that [...] "when you see the ads, you think, 'PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable, whereas Macs are just smug, preening tossers.'" [...] The British Sitcom Guide also criticised the pair for [...] "selling their souls". One journalist called the adverts [...] "worse than not funny", and accused Mitchell and Webb of [...] "an act of grave betrayal" [...] for taking corporate work. In an interview with The Telegraph, Robert Webb responded to the duo's critics, stating that [...] "when someone asks, 'Do you want to do some funny ads for not many days in the year and be paid more than you would be for an entire series of Peep Show?' the answer, obviously, is, 'Yeah, that's fine.'" [...] In the same interview, Mitchell also said: [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> morally inconsistent with a comedian doing an advert. It's all right to sell computers, isn't it?
