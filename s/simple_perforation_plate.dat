40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} Holmskioldia sanguinea Retz. {{has been done}} to study the {{structural}} variations in stem and root wood and to correlate them with growth habit and ecology of the plant. Vessels are wider and more abundant while rays (uni- to triserate) are taller in stem wood than in root wood, which possesses broad multiseriate rays. <b>Simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plate,</b> sparse vasicentric paratracheal parenchyma and perforated ray cells are the features common in both stem and root woods, while helical thickenings have been recorded only in the stem wood. Lower value of vulnerability, presence of wider vessels with <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plate,</b> and presence of helical thickening are indicators of wood xeromorphy in Holmskioldia sanguinea. Features like wider vessels and extensive height of rays in stem wood are in consonance with the climbing nature of the stem axis...|$|E

40|$|Early {{desiccation}} {{limits the}} vase life of Acacia cut flowers and foliage {{and may be}} attributable to poor hydraulic conductivity (K-h) of the cut stems. Acacia holosericea A. Cunn. ex G. Don has been adopted as the test species to investigate the postharvest water relations of the genus Acacia. To understand potential constraints on K-h, xylem conduits in cut A. holosericea stems were anatomically characterised by light and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Vessels with <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and tracheids were the principal water conducting cells. Bordered vestured intervessel pits were present in xylem vessel elements. The majority of conduits (89 %) were short at 1 - 5 cmlong. Only 2 % were 15 - 16 cmin length. Mean xylem conduit diameter was 77 +/- 0. 9 mu m and the diameter profile showed a normal distribution, with 29 % of diameters {{in the range of}} 70 - 80 mu m. <b>Simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> can offer relatively low resistance to water flow. On the other hand, bordered vestured pits and short xylem conduits can confer comparatively high resistance to water flow. Overall, the presence of bordered vestured pits, together with a high proportion of short xylem conduits and high stomatal densities (232 +/- 2 mm(- 2)) on unifacial phyllodes, could contribute to early dehydration of A. holosericea cut foliage stems standing in vase water. Further research will relate these anatomical features with changes in K-h and transpiration of cut foliage stems...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePremise of research. Piperales {{displays}} a wide diversity of growth forms {{that appears to}} be linked with differences in cambial activity and subsequent derived wood production. To date, no overall synthesis of the evolution of woodiness in Piperales has been done and few studies have proposed an ancestral habit (woody/herbaceous). We provide anatomical data of all lineages within Piperales and reconstruct ancestral character states, focusing on the origin of woodiness within the order and on the ecological significance of key anatomical features. Methodology. Stem anatomical observations with special emphasis on wood anatomical features were performed on 28 species of the Piperales; by combining previously published studies with original data, we conducted phylogenetic reconstructions of cambial activity and vessel element <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> to assess the origin of woodiness and vessel evolution in Piperales. Pivotal results. Different patterns of cambial activity are observed in Piperales, from active secondary growth in both intra- and interfascicular areas in Aristolochia, Thottea (Aristolochiaceae), Saruma (Asaraceae), Manekia, and Piper (Piperaceae) to cambial activity mainly restricted to fascicular areas in Saururaceae and a complete lack of secondary growth in Verhuellia. Vessels in Piperaceae, Aristolochiaceae, and Asaraceae present <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> while those of Saururaceae are mostly scalariform. A stem endodermis bearing a Casparian band—an atypical feature in aerial stems—is reported for all genera within the Piperaceae and for Saururus and Houttuynia in the Saururaceae. Conclusions. The common ancestor of the order likely had an active cambium and woody habit, including vessel elements with <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> All woody species share several wood features, including wide and tall rays, suggesting a single origin of wood in the order. The high diversity of growth forms observed in Piperales is linked to frequent shifts in cambial activity and changes in habit-related features within the different lineage...|$|R

Such study is very important since this species is already listed in the red list of IUCN and classified as critically endangered species. The microscopic slides were prepared according to the Johansen 2 ̆ 7 s method, while the anatomical features observed according to the IAWA List. The results show that S. mujongensis wood exhibit brown heartwood, light brown sapwood, rough texture, straight grain sometimes interlocked and somewhat rough. The main microscopic characters are growth rings indistinct; vessel diffuse, mostly solitary, rounded to oval; <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> and alternate intervessel pits; parenchyma scanty paratracheal to thin vasicentric; axial intercellular canals in long tangential line, radial intercellular canal and vasicentric tracheids present; rays uniseriate and multiseriate, prismatic crystal in procumbent cells; fiber length 1, 294 µm, diameter 26 µm and wall thickness 4 µm. Macroscopic and microscopic observation of S. mujongensis wood confirms the species belongs to yellow meranti group.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of vestured pits in angiosperms is briefly reviewed. In some major clades, {{the character is}} of constant occurrence and thus very conservative; in others, it is more variable and apparently subject to both parallel origins and reversible losses. There is a striking correlation between the type of vessel <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> and vestured pits. Virtually all taxa with vestured pits have <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> This correlation, together with contrasting ecological trends for scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and vestured pits, has inspired functional hypotheses that vestured pits contribute to hydraulic safety. Whereas scalariform perforations may be instrumental in reducing the effects of freezing-induced embolisms in temperate to boreal and alpine regions, vestured pits {{seem to be a}} good candidate to facilitate embolism reversal in xeric and warmer regions with high transpiration rates. The presence of highly lignified structures within the pit chamber may influence hydraulic resistance, decrease vulnerability to cavitation, or help to repair embolism by compartmentalizing or affecting the contact angle of the convex air-water interface within intervessel pits. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{secondary}} xylem of Elaeagnus, Hippophae. and Shepherdia is described and illustrated in detail. Shrubs and small trees of Elaeaguaceae have ring-porous or semi-ring-porous wood with <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> vascular tracheids, fiber-tracheids, diffuse or rarely paratracheal axial parenchyma, and uni- or biseriate rays in Hippophae and Shepherdia, but wider rays in Elaeagnus. Walls of vessel elements, especially narrow ones, tracheids, or fiber-tracheids sometimes show helical thickenings; {{in a few}} instances these intergrade with small bud-like protrusions associated with pits. Scanning electron microscopy illustrates that small to vestigial vestures are present in all species studied, although nonvestured pits are also common.

40|$|The {{qualitative}} and quantitative studies, presented in this article, on wood anatomy of various species belonging to ancient Magnolia genus reveal new aspects of phylogenetic relationships between the species and show evolutionary trends, known to increase fitness of conductive tissues in angiosperms. They also provide new examples of phenotypic plasticity in plants. 			 			The type of <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> in vessel members {{is one of the}} most relevant features for taxonomic studies. In Magnolia, until now, two types of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> have been reported: the conservative, scalariform and the specialized, simple one. 			 			In this paper, are presented some findings, new to magnolia wood science, like exclusively <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in some species or mixed <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> – <b>simple</b> and scalariform in one vessel member. Intravascular pitting is another taxonomically important trait of vascular tissue. Interesting transient states between different patterns of pitting in one cell only have been found. This proves great flexibility of mechanisms, which elaborate cell wall structure in maturing tracheary element.

40|$|High vein density (DV) {{evolution}} in angiosperms represented a key functional transition. Yet, a mechanistic account {{on how this}} hydraulic transformation evolved remains lacking. We demonstrate that a consequence of producing high DV is that veins must become very small to fit inside the leaf, and that angiosperms are the only clade that evolved the specific type of vessel required to yield sufficiently conductive miniature leaf veins. From 111 species spanning key divergences in vascular plant evolution, we show, using analyses of vein conduit {{evolution in}} relation to vein packing, that a key xylem innovation associated with high DV evolution is a strong reduction in vein thickness and simplification of the <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> of primary xylem vessels. <b>Simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in the leaf xylem occurred only in derived angiosperm clades exhibiting high DV (> 12 mm mm− 2). <b>Perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in the vessels of other species, including extant basal angiosperms, consisted of resistive scalariform types that were associated with thicker veins and much lower DV. We conclude that a reduction in within-vein conduit resistance allowed vein size to decrease.

40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} features are reported for mature wood and bark of {{two species of}} Kadsura and five species of Schisandra.

Differences in wood anatomy between Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae are nearly all differences of degree. These differences relate to the shrubby to arboreal habit in Illicium {{as opposed to the}} scandent habits in Schisandraceae. Larger pits on tracheids, wider and shorter vessel elements, and a high figure for conductive area per mm 2 of transection are features related to the scandent habit of Schisandraceae; opposing character states in Illicium relate to the self-supporting nature of growth forms in that genus...|$|R

Although, the wood anatomy of thePsychotria may be considered homogeneous, the statistical analyses, based on qualitative and quantitative features, allowed the segregation of the species and indicated the importance of habit (arboreous or shrubby) on the wood anatomy of the species. It is worth mentioning that the sampling was realized in only one studied site (Ilha Grande), which contributed to the conclusion that the wood characteristics are more related to the specificities of each studied taxon than to with environmental variations...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{of seven}} {{collections}} of six species of Nolana, a genus (18 spp.) {{of the central}} western coast of South America was studied for quantitative and qualitative features. The wood is ring porous, with moderately wide vessels bearing <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and alternate pits with some grooves interconnecting slitlike pit apertures. Imperforate tracheary elements are fiber-tracheids with vestigial borders on pits or libriform fibers; vasicentric tracheids (reported for Nolanaceae for the first time) are present in varying numbers. Axial parenchyma is vasicentric scanty (sometimes absent), sometimes with tangential bands that may be terminal in part. Rays are both multiseriate and uniseriate; ray cells are mostly erect. Crystal sand occurs in some ray cells and some axial parenchyma. The sum of features mark Nolanaceae as very close to Solanaceae. Wood of Nolana varies in xeromorphy; lower degrees of xeromorphy {{may be explained by}} succulence related to maritime habitat or to ephemeral nature of stems. The erect nature of ray cells and a decrease in vessel element length are indicators of paedomorphosis and thereby herbaceous ness of Nolanaceae...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} {{vegetative}} anatomy in phylogenetic analysis is documented. Examples {{of the use}} of vegetative anatomy at different taxonomic levels show the continuing role of the anatomical method in building a more natural system of classification of the dicotyledons. The importance of correlating wood and leaf anatomical features with ecological and floristic preferences of taxa is emphasized. Caution is required in basing phylogenetic interpretations upon similarities and differences in xylem structure. The transition from scalariform to <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> is the only aspect of vessel element evolution that is not potentially reversible and all phylogenetic analyses must reflect this important principle. Some groups outside the Magnoliidae (Annoniflorae) possess very primitive xylems and can be used as evidence to support a pattern of multiple early radiations of the dicotyledons, as well as the increased awareness of a lack of clear subclass definition. The application of anatomical characters in cladistic analysis is reviewed, and the need to utilize strictly homologous features, to provide accurate scoring of character states, and to give proper interpretations to character state transformations is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|The seven {{families}} hypothesized by Sosa and Chase {{to comprise}} Crossosomatales possess relatively long vessel elements with scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and scalariform to opposite vessel-ray pitting; tracheids; diffuse axial parenchyma; and heterogeneous rays. These and other primitive character {{states do not}} indicate relationships, {{but they do not}} offer any evidence against the idea that Crossosomatales are a natural order. Departures from the primitive character states are related to ecological adaptations. Crossosomataceae have <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> (scalariform brieﬂy {{at the beginning of the}} secondary xylem), a feature correlated with the seasonal aridity of habitats occupied by the family, the sole family of the order to exhibit such an ecological shift. Presence of tracheids (which confer embolism resistance to a wood) in ancestors of Crossosomataceae probably pre-adapted the family for entry into highly seasonal habitats. Minimal vessel grouping in all other genera shows that tracheid presence deters vessel grouping; tracheid presence also deters shortening of vessel elements. Autapomorphies are shown by Aphloiaceae (tracheid dimorphism, rays of two distinct widths); Crossosomataceae (<b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> predominantly <b>simple,</b> lateral wall pitting of vessels alternate); Geissolomataceae (wide rays); Ixerbaceae (ﬁber-tracheid tendency); Staphyleaceae (adjacence of axial parenchyma to vessels); Stachyuraceae (simpliﬁcation of perforation plates); and Strasburgeriaceae (large cell size).

Tetrameristaccae and Pellicieraceae are found to be closely related based on the occurrence of unilaterally compound vessel-ray pitting and multiseriate rays with long uniseriate ends. The narrow rays in Pelliciera are characteristic of this genus, but a broader concept of Tetrameristaceae including Pelliciera is favored. Within Marcgraviaceae, wide rays (more than five-seriate) are typical of the genus Marcgravia. Furthermore, there is evidence that the impact of altitude and habit {{plays an important role in}} the wood structure of this family. The wood structure of Balsaminaceae cannot be compared systematically with other balsaminoids because of their secondary woodiness.

40|$|Vestures {{are small}} {{projections}} from the secondary cell wall associated with tracheary {{elements of the}} secondary xylem. They are usually associated with bordered pits and characterize various angiosperm families, including important timber species such as Dipterocarpaceae and Eucalyptus trees. The micromorphology and distribution of vestures is studied in 22 species representing all families within the order Myrtales based on light and scanning electron microscopy. Vestures are consistently present near the outer pit aperture of bordered vessel pits, suggesting the synapomorphic character of this feature for the entire order. It is unclear in which geological period this feature originated {{in the evolution of}} the pre-Myrtalean lineages. In some species vestures are associated with inner pit apertures, inner vessel walls, <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> depressions of the cell wall, and bordered pits of tracheids or fibre-tracheids. A compact network of branched vestures almost completely filling the entire pit chamber is the most common vestured pit type in Myrtales, although considerable variation may occur within a wood sample. The micromorphology of vestures seems to some extent correlated with quantitative pit characters. Understanding the exact function of vestured pits with respect to hydraulic efficiency and safety remains a challenge. status: publishe...|$|R

Increase in thickness of the stem was achieved by formation of successive cambia, from which initially two or three successive rings formed complete oval to circular cambia. Thereafter, the successive cambia were always crescent-shaped and never formed a complete cylinder, resulting in dumbbell-shaped cross-sectional outlines of the stems.

This new species of Sassafrasoxylon Brezinová et Süss resembles the species of extant Sassafras in being distinctly ring-porous, having vessel elements with <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and very occasional scalariform plates with relatively few bars in the narrowest latewood vessels, alternate intervascular pitting, marginal (initial) parenchyma bands and paratracheal vasicentric parenchyma in the latewood, multiseriate rays and oil and /or mucilage cells. The fossils were found as isolated pieces of wood and therefore it is not certain whether the parent plant was Sassafras- like in all characters. Consequently the fossils {{have been placed in}} an organ genus rather than in extant Sassafras. This is the oldest record of an organ with features closest to extant Sassafras and may suggest that Sassafras first appeared in Gondwana and later radiated into the Northern Hemisphere. The distribution of extant Sassafras in North America and East Asia may represent a relict of a geographically more widespread taxon in the past...|$|R
40|$|Early {{angiosperms}} are hypothesized as constrained to wet environments {{where many}} of their defining characteristics evolved. A functional capability potentially enforcing the wet habitation of early angiosperms was possession of xylem with low hydraulic capability and drought intolerance. Recent studies indicate that a structural hallmark of these performances is long, steeply angled scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in extant basal angiosperms. However, Canella winterana (Canellaceae), a magnoliid, appears to have radiated into much drier tropical dry forest habitats despite possessing a wood vasculature structurally similar to hypothesized ancestral wet-adapted system for angiosperms as a whole. Based on a field study of Canella wood hydraulic function, we present ecophysiological data that basal vessels do not necessarily mark low resistance to drought. We found that Canella wood was resistant to drought-induced cavitation. Leaf hydraulic capacity as well as leaf pressure-volume relations and leaf water potential minima found for Canella were comparable {{to some of the}} most drought-tolerant tropical dry forest angiosperms. Thus, our results suggest that vessels of an ancestral design can be exported to dry environments. We found that scalariform-plated vessels in Canella were associated with low hydraulic capacities at the xylem and whole shoot-scales as well as limited plasticity of the xylem to varying hydrodynamic demand. Consequently, our results support the hypothesis that evolution of <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> not vessels per se, represented a critical adaptation for producing large hydraulic gains during angiosperm evolution across a broader range of environments...|$|R

40|$|Specimens of Gahnia sieberiana from Brisbane, Queensland, and of Gahnia clarkei {{from near}} Orbost, Victoria, were {{collected}} and examined both morphologically and anatomically. The species grow in wet areas and {{are of interest}} because they represent the largest arborescent species known in the Cyperaceae. Stem diameters up to 120 mm and stems up to 10 m long have been observed. Such long stems tend to be supported by nearby vegetation. Although fresh stems are tough and woody, they are brittle. Branching of the stems is sympodial, and numerous branches are produced by plants growing in exposed habitats. There is less branching in plants from shaded habitats. Basal shoots may also occur. Adventitious roots develop basally on most plants, but with G. sieberiana, some adventitious roots form near the shoot apex and grow in and around leaf bases. Anatomical features of interest are an endodermoid layer composed of sclereids with elongate, undulated, outer tangential walls that are lignified and suberized, short vessel elements with horizontal to oblique <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> and relatively short sclereids surrounding vessel elements in the vascular bundles. Some vascular bundles are bipolar. The presence of short vessel elements here is {{in marked contrast to}} the longer tracheary elements in other arborescent monocotyledons...|$|R
40|$|Secondary xylem of fibrous cactus wood is {{characterized}} by short narrow vessel elements with both <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and large intervessel pits, libriform septate fibers, and large rays. These are present in basal cactus taxa, {{as well as in}} many other groups of the family. In Cactoideae, the most diversified and most derived subfamily, there are remarkable variations found in the secondary xylem, with the more highly derived taxa containing the greatest water storage capacity. Unlignified parenchyma is one specialization found in the fibrous wood of cacti. We observed this tissue in the secondary xylem {{at the base of the}} sterns of several Brazilian endemic species of Arrojadoa, Melocactus, and Stephanocereus, all members of the tribe Cereeae. In Arrojadoa and Melocactus the unlignified parenchyma occurs in lines and bands amongst the axial and radial xylem elements, while in Stephanocereus it is mainly restricted to the rays and does not form bands. We address the adaptive importance of the unlignified parenchyma in the fibrous wood in tribe Cereeae and the family Cactaceae as a whole.

40|$|Bordered pits play an {{important}} role in permitting water flow among adjacent tracheary elements in flowering plants. Variation in the bordered pit structure is suggested to be adaptive in optimally balancing the conflict between hydraulic efficiency (conductivity) and safety from air entry at the pit membrane (air seeding). The possible function of vestured pits, which are bordered pits with protuberances from the secondary cell wall of the pit chamber, could be increased hydraulic resistance or minimized vulnerability to air seeding. These functional hypotheses have to be harmonized with the notion that the vestured or nonvestured nature of pits contains strong phylogenetic signals (i. e., often characterize large species-rich clades with broad ecological ranges). A literature survey of 11, 843 species covering 6, 428 genera from diverse climates indicates that the incidence of vestured pits considerably decreases from tropics to tundra. The highest frequencies of vestured pits occur in deserts and tropical seasonal woodlands. Moreover, a distinctly developed network of branched vestures is mainly restricted to warm habitats in both mesic and dry (sub) tropical lowlands, whereas vestures in woody plants from cold and boreal arctic environments are usually minute and simple. A similar survey of the frequency of exclusively scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> illustrates that the major ecological trend of this feature is opposite that of vestured pits. These findings provide previously undescribed insights suggesting that vessels with vestured pits and <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> function as an efficient hydraulic system in plants growing in warm environments with periodical or continuous drought stress. status: publishe...|$|R

A detailed anatomical structure of vegetative organs: leaf, petiole, rhizome and root {{of a highly}} medicinal plant Bergenia ciliata were described for the first time. Cells in all parts were rich in starch grains and some cells contain calcium oxalate crystals. Some important anatomical features were: a hood like structure found in its lower portion of petiole; petiole supplied with numerous conjoint, collateral and open vascular bundles with poorly differentiated bundle sheath; leaves amphistomatic; ten to fifteen conjoint, collateral and open vascular bundles found in mid vein of leaf. Globular trichomes were present in {{abaxial side of leaf}} and petiole; cork of rhizome divided into two zones; cork cambium multilayered; secondary growth evident in rhizome and root; activity of interfascicular cambium in rhizome was lacking. Endodermis and pericycle only found in root was crushed during secondary growth; polyarch xylem and phloem in root; vessels short and narrow with <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> There was no comprehensible difference in size of central and lateral vascular bundles of leaf and petiole as in some other Saxifragaceae. Well developed bundle sheath which was the characteristic feature of many Saxifragaceae was feebly distinguished in the leaf and petiole of B. ciliata. The globular trichomes found in leaf and petiole of B. ciliata is probably a new feature for Saxifragaceae...|$|R

40|$|Palms lack {{secondary}} growth so their primary vascular system is long-lived {{and must be}} minimally vulnerable to dysfunction. For water movement, the axial xylem must be well defended against cavitation. Climbing palms can be very long and represent a maximum solution to transport problems. How is this demonstrated in their anatomy? This article contrasts stem vascular anatomy in a canelike 2 ̆ 2 tree palm 2 ̆ 2 (Rhapis excelsa) with that in the American climbing palm Desmoncus and the Old World rattan genus Calamus. Rhapis, representing the basic classical palm vasculature, has a continuously integrated vascular system determined by branching of the axial (stem) system to produce leaf traces, bridges, and continuing axial bundles. Axial transport is favored over appendicular structures because leaves are irrigated solely by narrower protoxylem tracheids. Maximum stem vessel length is inherently limited by the leaf contact distance (LCD). Desmoncus is very similar except that interconnections involve more numerous bridges and axial continuity is less obvious. Both Rhapis and Desmoncus retain scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in their stem vessels. However, Calamus lacks axial continuity because axial bundles extend distally into leaves as leaf traces but end blindly in a basipetal direction. The only interconnection is via narrow transverse commissures (not bridges). Calamus stem metaxylem vessels have <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> Resistance to water transport can be calculated, based on axial changes in metaxylem vessel diameter and is very high in the climbing palms. The unique features of Calamus may relate to safety of the hydraulic system as much as its efficiency, with Desmoncus an intermediate condition more clearly based on the classical model of palm vasculature. Calamus may have also evolved to mitigate the limitation of vessel length determined by LCD. Further anatomical solutions to the climbing habit in palms are briefly discussed...|$|R
