40|$|Active muscle <b>shortening</b> {{reduces the}} {{isometric}} force potential of muscle. This observation {{indicates that the}} isometric length-force characteristics are altered during muscle <b>shortening.</b> Post-shortening decrease in isometric force depends on starting length, <b>shortening</b> amplitude and <b>shortening</b> velocity. In the present study, post-shortening decrease in isometric force was determined after isokinetic contractions with various <b>shortening</b> amplitudes initiated from different lengths of rat medial gastrocnemius muscle. For a given target length post-shortening force decrease increased linearly with <b>shortening</b> amplitude. We found that the quotient of post-shortening force decrease and <b>shortening</b> amplitude depended linearly on muscle length. Based on our experimental results and those from other studies, we conclude that <b>shortening</b> induced changes in isometric length-force characteristics can be described by two simple functions.

40|$|Introduction: When {{muscle is}} allowed to <b>shorten</b> during an active contraction, the maximum force that redevelops after <b>shortening</b> is smaller than the {{isometric}} force at the same muscle length without prior <b>shortening.</b> We studied the course of force redevelopment after <b>shortening</b> in smooth muscle to unravel the mechanism responsible for this deactivation. Method: In a first series of measurements the <b>shortening</b> velocity was varied resulting in different <b>shortening</b> amplitudes. In a second series, the duration of stimulation before <b>shortening</b> (<b>shortening</b> delay) was varied. In a third series the stimulation was interrupted for a certain duration immediately after <b>shortening.</b> Force, muscle length and stimulation were continuously recorded. Time constants were calculated to describe the rate of force development before and after <b>shortening.</b> Results: With increasing <b>shortening</b> amplitude and with increasing <b>shortening</b> delay, force redevelopment decreased. Redevelopment increased {{with an increase in}} the interruption time. After stimulus interruption force redeveloped mono-exponentially with a time constant similar to that of isometric contractions (~ 3 s). Without the interruption of stimulation, the redevelopment of force immediately after <b>shortening</b> was best described by two time constants; one similar to and one about 3 - 5 times faster than the isometric time constant. Discussion: Force (re) development is caused by a cascade of events leading to the cycling of cross-bridges. In smooth muscle, isometric force development is described by a time constant of about 3 s. Force redevelopment immediately after <b>shortening</b> involves a second process which takes place at a faster rate (time constant about 1 s). We assume that this process is faster due to the immediate availability of cytoplasmic calcium released during active <b>shortening.</b> Deactivation presumably is caused by disorganisation of filaments during <b>shortening...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background—Postsystolic <b>shortening</b> in ischemic {{myocardium}} {{has been}} proposed as a marker of tissue viability. Our objectives were to determine if postsystolic <b>shortening</b> represents active fiber <b>shortening</b> or passive recoil and if postsystolic <b>shortening</b> may be quantified by strain Doppler echocardiography (SDE). Methods and Results—In 15 anesthetized dogs, we measured left ventricular (LV) pressure, myocardial long-axis strains by SDE, and segment lengths by sonomicrometry before and during LAD stenosis and occlusion. Active contraction was defined as elevated LVP and stress during postsystolic <b>shortening</b> {{when compared with the}} fully relaxed ventricle at similar segment lengths. LAD stenosis decreased systolic <b>shortening</b> from 10. 41. 2 % to 5. 90. 9 % (P 0. 05), whereas postsystolic <b>shortening</b> increased from 1. 10. 3 % to 4. 20. 7 % (P 0. 05). In hypokinetic and akinetic segments, LV pressure–segment length and LV stress–segment length loop analysis indicated that postsystolic <b>shortening</b> was active. LAD occlusion resulted in dyskinesis, and postsystolic <b>shortening</b> increased additionally to 8. 21. 0 % (P 0. 05). After 3 to 5 minutes with LAD occlusion, the dyskinetic segment generated no active stress, and the postsystolic <b>shortening</b> was attributable to passive recoil. Elevation of afterload caused hypokinetic segments to become dyskinetic, and postsystolic <b>shortening</b> remained partly active. Postsystolic <b>shortening</b> by SDE correlated well with sonomicrometry (r 0. 83, P 0. 01).

40|$|Background: The {{importance}} of the stabilizing effect of the distal interosseous membrane on the distal radioulnar joint, especially in patients with a distal oblique bundle, has been described. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the stability of the distal radioulnar joint after an ulnar <b>shortening</b> osteotomy and to quantify longitudinal resistance to ulnar <b>shortening</b> when the osteotomy was proximal or distal to the ulnar attachment of the distal interosseous membrane. These relationships were characterized for forearms with or without a distal oblique bundle. Methods: Ten fresh-frozen cadavers were used. A transverse osteotomy and ulnar <b>shortening</b> was performed proximal (proximal <b>shortening)</b> and distal (distal <b>shortening)</b> to the ulnar attachment of the distal interosseous membrane. Distal radioulnar joint laxity was evaluated as the volar and dorsal displacements of the radius relative to the fixed ulna with 20 N of applied force. Testing was performed under controlled 1 -mm increments of ulnar <b>shortening</b> up to 4 mm, with the forearm in neutral alignment, 60 of pronation, and 60 of supination. Resistance to ulnar <b>shortening</b> was quantified as the slope of the load-displacement curve obtained by displacing the distal ulnar segment proximally. Results: In proximal <b>shortening,</b> significantly greater stability of the distal radioulnar joint was obtained with even 1 mm of <b>shortening</b> compared with the control, whereas distal <b>shortening</b> demonstrated significant improvement in stability of the distal radioulnar joint only after <b>shortening</b> of ‡ 4 mm in all rotational positions.

30|$|The axial <b>shortening</b> {{analysis}} of a concrete tall building essentially requires a construction sequence analysis and a creep {{analysis of}} the concrete structure. The construction sequence analysis {{is a series of}} static analyses, where new construction activities are applied to an already deformed and stressed structure (Kurc and Lulec 2013). Before defining the geometry of the newly added structure for the construction sequence analysis, it is necessary to determine what type of <b>shortening</b> is considered. Total <b>shortening</b> in a tall building can be divided into pre-installation and post-installation <b>shortening</b> (Fintel et al. 1987). Pre-installation <b>shortening</b> and post-installation <b>shortening</b> are sometimes called up-to-slab <b>shortening</b> and subsequent <b>shortening,</b> respectively. In cast-in-place concrete building structures, pre-installation <b>shortening,</b> which is the amount of <b>shortening</b> developed before slab installation, is meaningless since it is automatically compensated by leveling the forms. On the other hand, in steel building structures where columns are prepared to exact lengths, the total <b>shortening,</b> which is the sum of the pre-installation and the post-installation shortenings, is of significance because the slabs are built at a predetermined position. In this study, the analysis models are reinforced concrete tall buildings and the post-installation shortenings are calculated. In an analysis model, the displacement of each node is assumed to be zero until the node is generated. The incremental displacements are calculated for each construction step. The incremental vertical displacements at the columns and walls are accumulated to yield the post-installation <b>shortening</b> at the target time.|$|R

40|$|Objectives. This {{study of}} {{hypertensive}} {{left ventricular hypertrophy}} 1) assessed myocardial <b>shortening</b> in both the circumferential and long-axis planes, and 2) investigated the relation between geometry and systolic function. Background. In hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy, whole-heart studies have suggested normal systolic function {{on the basis of}} ejection fraction-systolic stress relations. By contrast, isolated muscle data show that contractility is depressed. It occurred to us that this discrepancy could be related to geometric factors (relative wall thickness). Methods. We studied 43 patients with hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy and normal ejection fraction (mean ± SD 69 ± 13 %) and 50 clinically normal subjects. By echocardiography, percent myocardial <b>shortening</b> was measured in two orthogonal planes; circumferential <b>shortening</b> was measured at the endocardium and at the midwall, and long-axis <b>shortening</b> was derived from mitral annular motion (apical four-chamber view). Circumferential <b>shortening</b> was related to end-systolic circumferential stress and long-axis <b>shortening</b> to meridional stress. Results. Endocardial circumferential <b>shortening</b> was higher than normal (42 ± 10 % vs. 37 ± 5 %, p 2 SD of normal relations, indicating depressed myocardial function. There was no significant relation between long-axis <b>shortening</b> and meridional stress, indicating that factors other than afterload influence <b>shortening</b> in this plane. Conclusions.

40|$|Despite higher neural {{activation}} during {{active as}} compared to passive muscle <b>shortening,</b> Hoffman reflexes (H-reflexes) are similar. This {{may be explained by}} homosynaptic post-activation depression (HPAD) of Ia-afferents being present during active <b>shortening.</b> Accordingly, it was investigated whether conditioning electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve reduced the H-reflex less during active than passive <b>shortening.</b> The effects of two conditioning modes (0. 2 and 1 Hz) were compared to a control mode without conditioning. H-reflexes and M-waves were elicited as the ankle passed 90 degrees with the soleus muscle undergoing passive or active (20 % MVC) lengthening or <b>shortening.</b> Conditioning had no effect during active <b>shortening.</b> In contrast, during passive <b>shortening,</b> the H:M of the I Hz mode was significantly less than that of the 0. 2 Hz and control modes. In lengthening, H:M was unaffected by conditioning.
