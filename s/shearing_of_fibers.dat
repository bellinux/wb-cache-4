"Though all CFRP {{materials}} are manufactured to their near net shape, they require a secondary machining operation for their final assemblage. In doing so, {{the main problem}} encountered is damage that results from delamination. Since CFRP {{materials are}} highly abrasive in nature, their machining requires that both the cutting and <b>shearing</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibers</b> occur simultaneously. Hence, cutting tools should incorporate tool geometry that effectively responds to these requirements. In this research, the routing of CFRP composite materials was done with a diamond interlocked tool. Experiments were conducted by varying spindle speed and feed rate, keeping the radial depth of cut constant. The main objective {{of this research was}} to develop a quantifiable method of tool wear measurement in a diamond interlocked tool and thus determine the time for tool replacement. Unlike the conventional cutting tools, the diamond interlocked tool has a unique tool geometry used for machining FRP materials, and poses substantial challenge in the process of tool wear measurement. However, four methods of direct wear measurement techniques [...] -fracture wear, maximum flank wear, tip recession and wear area, were assessed. Insensitivity of these direct wear measurements with respect to the process parameters namely spindle speed and feed rate, made it difficult to determine the time for tool replacement time. Furthermore, an indirect method of tool wear quantification was developed by using delamination factor and power, against cutting distance. The values of tool life were then analyzed in ANOVA, the model produced significant result at 95 % confidence level, and a generalized tool life equation and power equation for tool replacement time were developed...|$|E

40|$|<b>Shear</b> {{strength}} <b>of</b> <b>fiber</b> {{reinforced concrete}} beams was studied {{in this research}} project. Three types <b>of</b> <b>fibers</b> were examined: hooked-end steel fiber, crimped-steel fiber, and crimped-monofilament polypropylene fibers. The experimental program included five beam specimens. Two of the beams were control specimens in which one was reinforced with minimum shear reinforcement according to ACI 318, while the other one {{did not have any}} shear reinforcement. Each one of the other three specimens was reinforced with one of the above mentioned fibers by 1 % volumetric ratio. In addition to the beam specimens, three prisms were also made for each type fiber to determine their toughness. The aim of this research was to investigate the following questions for medium-high concrete strength 1) {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} each type <b>of</b> <b>fibers</b> on the <b>shear</b> strength, 2) to investigate the shear strength, toughness, crack patterns and near ultimate load crack width of each beam, and 3) to determine if using 1 % volumetric ratio <b>of</b> <b>fibers</b> as <b>shear</b> reinforcement in beams would provide adequate strength and stiffness properties comparable to reinforcing steel used as minimum shear reinforcement. The results showed that all three types <b>of</b> <b>fibers</b> increased the <b>shear</b> capacity <b>of</b> the beam specimens more than the beam reinforced with minimum shear reinforcement. Moreover, some <b>of</b> the <b>fibers</b> used could shift the type of failure from a pure shear failure to a combined flexural-shear or pure flexural failure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a two-phase experimental program investigating the punching <b>shear</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced polymer reinforced concrete (FRP RC) flat slabs with and without carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) shear reinforcement. In the first phase, problems of bond slip and crack localization were identified. Decreasing the flexural bar spacing in the second phase successfully eliminated those problems and resulted in punching <b>shear</b> failure <b>of</b> the slabs. However, CFRP shear reinforcement was found to be inefficient in enhancing significantly the slab capacity due to its brittleness. A model, which accurately predicts the punching <b>shear</b> capacity <b>of</b> FRP RC slabs without shear reinforcement, is proposed and verified. For slabs with FRP shear reinforcement, it is proposed that the concrete shear resistance is reduced, but a strain limit of 0. 0045 is recommended as maximum strain for the reinforcement. Comparisons of the slab capacities with ACI 318 - 95, ACI 440 - 98, and BS 8110 punching shear code equations, modified to incorporate FRP reinforcement, show either overestimated or conservative results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Basalt fiber has the {{advantages}} of non-pollution and omnipotence, and expected to be widely used in the 21 st Century. Therefore, more and more attention is paid on experimental research <b>of</b> the basalt <b>fiber</b> in the world. Firstly, according to the type selection principles and requirements <b>of</b> the <b>fibers</b> used in the hydraulic concrete, the contrast testing of the plastic shrinkage between fiber cement mortar and pure mortar is made. The experimental results showed that basalt fiber, polypropylene fiber and polyacrylonitrile fiber can be preliminarily chosen as reinforced fibers in high performance hydraulic concrete. Secondly, the impacts of the suggested three sorts <b>of</b> <b>fibers</b> on the interfacial <b>shear</b> stress <b>of</b> the <b>fiber</b> concrete are analyzed by numerical simulation，which showed that maximum interfacial <b>shear</b> stress <b>of</b> the basalt <b>fiber</b> concrete is minimum. So, the bond strength between basalt fiber and concrete is the best. Finally, taking both characteristics <b>of</b> basalt <b>fiber</b> and the increase of concrete costs into account, {{it can be concluded}} that top priority should be given to the basalt fiber rather than to other fibers for high performance hydraulic concrete...|$|R

The tensile strength, the shear strength and the deformation modulus of bolt control the <b>shear</b> behavior <b>of</b> a <b>sheared</b> bolted joint. Since the strength and deformation modulus of FG bolt, rock bolt and cable bolt obtained from uniaxial tensile tests are different, their shear behavior in reinforcing joints is accordingly different. Test results showed that the <b>shear</b> stiffness <b>of</b> FG bolted joints decreased gradually from the beginning to end, while the <b>shear</b> stiffness <b>of</b> joints reinforced by rock bolt and cable bolt decreased bi-linearly, which is clearly consistent with their tensile deformation modulus. The bolted joint shear stiffness was highly influenced by bolt pretension in the high stiffness stage for both rock bolt and cable bolt, but not in the low stiffness stage. The rock bolt contribution to joint shear strength standardised by the bolt tensile strength was the largest, followed by cable bolts, then FG bolts. Both the rock bolts and cable bolts tended to fail in tension, while FG bolts in shear due to their low shear strength and constant deformation modulus...|$|R

A total of 28 simply-supported beams with a <b>shear</b> span-to-depth ratio <b>of</b> 3. 5 were subjected to monotonically-increased, concentrated load. Target concrete compressive strength for all beams was 6000 psi. The studied parameters included fiber type, fiber volume fraction (between 0. 75 and 1. 5 %), longitudinal tension reinforcement ratio (approximately 1. 6, 2. 0 and 2. 7 %), and beam depth (18 in. or 27 in.). Three types <b>of</b> steel <b>fibers</b> were considered, all with hooks at their ends. Two <b>of</b> the <b>fibers</b> evaluated were 1. 2 inch long, with aspect ratio of either 55 or 80. The third type <b>of</b> <b>fiber</b> investigated was 2. 36 inch long, with an aspect ratio of 80. Test results showed that the use <b>of</b> hooked steel <b>fibers</b> in a volume fraction {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 75 % led to a substantial increase in shear strength and significantly reduced the size effect for <b>shear</b> strength <b>of</b> beams with depths of up to 27 in.

40|$|Abstract. Composite metal decking {{has become}} one of the {{prevalent}} forms of Fast Track Construction for multi-story steel buildings. The in-plane stiffness of composite metal decks however is of considerable importance as they typically act as a diaphragm in lateral-load- resisting systems and thus attract a large in-plane shear. The diaphragm action or the in-plane <b>shear</b> capacity <b>of</b> composite metal decks remained a concern for structural engineers and designers. The present work aims to investigate the in-plane <b>shear</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced composite metal decks and compare it to that reinforced with welded wire mesh. A comprehensive experimental program involving testing large scale slabs was conducted. Steel decking of trapezoidal profile with a sheet thickness of 0. 9 mm was used to construct the composite slabs. Conventional WWF mesh reinforcement and synthetic macro fibers at different reinforcing rates were considered in the test program. The slabs were tested under monotonically increasing in-plane shear force until failure. Load-deflection responses were plotted and cracking pattern and sequence were recorded. The test results show that fibers provide comparable deck behavior as that with steel mesh. Both imparted similar ultimate in-plane shear capacity and enhanced the ductility and the post peak behavior of the composite metal decks relative to the control slab. The results demonstrate the viability <b>of</b> synthetic macro <b>fibers</b> to replace the steel mesh in this type of composite flooring systems...|$|R

They all possess high content of oxygen, and the ratio of O/C of the three carbon fibers is between 0. 23 - 0. 27. The multifilament tensile property is similar, which reveals the domestic carbon fibers have stable quality control, and the breaking elongation rate of about 1. 9 revealing that the fiber and resin matrix matching is good. The tensile strength <b>of</b> single <b>fiber</b> is unstable, meanwhile the high tensile surface active functional group has big influence on the interface <b>shear</b> strength <b>of</b> carbon <b>fibers...</b>|$|R
