5|$|In the UK Control Risks, a British {{security}} company—paid by {{an anonymous}} donor {{to assist the}} McCanns since 7 May—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September, at their parents' request. The twins had <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives. According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, {{three months after the}} disappearance, but they had not done so. Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.|$|E
5|$|Finally, to keep Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{distracted from}} Danny's fanfare, TGS producer, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) sends {{them to the}} makeup {{department}} to have plaster face-prints made while NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) talks to them. Jenna and Tracy are plagued by erotic dreams involving Kenneth, and to stop having them, they decide to stay awake. This fails, so they decide {{to deal with it}} à la A Nightmare on Elm Street, by killing Kenneth in their dreams. They wake up (believing they are still dreaming) and attack Kenneth. Witnessing this, Pete tells them they are wide awake, and that it is morning, which prompts Jenna and Tracy to realize that they <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night without having any dreams of Kenneth. They apologize to Kenneth for attacking him, and he accepts their apology.|$|E
25|$|In all, 1,663 {{passengers}} and crew had been rescued from Andrea Doria. The badly damaged Stockholm, {{through the use of}} both her own lifeboats and those from the stricken Andrea Doria, took on a total of 545 survivors, of whom 234 were crew members from the Andrea Doria; 129 survivors had been rescued by Cape Ann, 159 by Pvt. William H. Thomas, 77 by Edward H. Allen, including Captain Calamai and his officers, and one very fortunate American sailor who <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> entire collision and evacuation had been lucky enough to be rescued from the abandoned, sinking liner by the tanker Robert E. Hopkins. Île de France undoubtedly played the largest role in the rescue, having taken on a total of 753 survivors.|$|E
50|$|In the aftermath, Yajirobe appears and {{provides}} everyone with Senzu Beans. At Kame House, Master Roshi, who <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> all <b>the</b> events, {{wakes up and}} wishes for something exciting to happen.|$|R
60|$|When the bagpiper had thus {{concluded}} {{his business}} {{he went to}} bed at his inn. And for the first time during three months the people of Hamel <b>slept</b> quietly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night.|$|R
5000|$|... 8. The {{big fish}} became a nice dinner for all and all <b>slept</b> soundly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night. That night, Gunsanad {{had a dream}} about obtaining the Kumala at the same spot where he caught the fish ...|$|R
500|$|Until then, Peel {{had been}} {{ineffective}} in the match. Several of the England team, including Peel, drank {{heavily in the}} night thinking the game was lost, but overnight rain drastically {{changed the nature of}} the pitch. Peel had not sobered up when play was scheduled to start, although Stoddart had given him a cold shower to speed up the process, and arrived late. As another player was also missing, the start was delayed; this allowed the pitch to dry further and therefore become more sticky and difficult to bat on. Peel had <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> overnight storm and was astonished when he saw the state of the pitch, suspecting someone had watered it. He reportedly said: [...] "Gi' me t'ball, Mr Stoddart. Ah'll get t'buggers out before lunch". With Briggs, Peel bowled Australia out, taking five wickets to go with the one he took the previous evening to finish with six for 67. Australia scored 166 and lost by ten runs. One Australian newspaper reported that Peel [...] "found the match rather a trying one, and came in fairly done up". The English team were praised for fighting back, but the role of the weather was acknowledged, and some critics blamed the Australians for batting badly in the second innings.|$|E
2500|$|The autopsy also {{revealed}} a [...] "vegetable or fruit material which may represent pineapple" [...] which JonBenét had eaten {{a few hours}} before her death. Photographs of the home taken on the day when JonBenét's body was found show a bowl of pineapple on the kitchen table with a spoon in it. However, both Patsy and John Ramsey said they did not remember putting the bowl on the table or feeding pineapple to JonBenét. Police reported that they found JonBenét's nine-year-old brother Burke Ramsey's fingerprints on the bowl. The Ramseys have always maintained that Burke <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> entire episode until he was awakened several hours after the police arrived.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 January 1839, Charles married Emma at Maer, Staffordshire in an Anglican {{ceremony}} {{arranged to}} also suit the Unitarians, {{conducted by the}} vicar, their cousin John Allen Wedgwood. Emma's bedridden mother <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> service, sparing Emma [...] "the pain of parting". Immediately afterwards Charles and Emma rushed off to the railway station, raising their relative's eyebrows, and ate their sandwiches and toasted their future from a [...] "bottle of water" [...] on the train. Back at Macaw Cottage, Charles noted in his journal [...] "Married at Maer & returned to London 30 years old", and in his [...] "E" [...] notebook recorded uncle John Wedgwood's views on turnips.|$|E

60|$|The armies {{came into}} {{collision}} in the neighbourhood of two {{o'clock in the}} morning. Mr. Blood <b>slept</b> undisturbed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> distant boom of cannon. Not until four o'clock, when the sun was rising to dispel the last wisps of mist over that stricken field of battle, did he awaken from his tranquil slumbers.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, Atchison revealed that he <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> most of <b>the</b> day of his alleged presidency: [...] "There had been three or four busy nights finishing up the work of the Senate, and I slept most of that Sunday." ...|$|R
2500|$|Eight of {{the eleven}} tracks on Prayers on Fire were written or co-written by Cave, [...] " [...] {{was a kind of}} {{reaction}} to the major disappointments we felt when we went to England... began to see a vision and I don't think we were positively influenced ... we didn't want to be like the English New Wave pop groups of the time". Pew observed [...] " [...] stinks, quite honestly ... The engineer <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> entire session for a start". In Melbourne, in December 1980 and January 1981, they joined engineer and producer, Tony Cohen, in Armstrong's Audio Visual Studios (A.A.V. Studio 2) and Richmond Recorders, to record their tracks. Music journalist, Toby Creswell, noted that the band [...] "struggled with creating their own identity some of them also began indulging an appetite for alcohol and heroin". Cave was embarrassed by [...] "Zoo Music Girl" [...] but noted [...] "we were digging for something and we kind of just found it with some songs" [...] and cited [...] "King Ink" [...] as an example of [...] "a certain kind of sound that we wanted to work with on records after that".|$|E
2500|$|... “Although she {{was well}} over forty, she had lost none of her high spirits; she was kind and affectionate, but her {{eccentric}} and despotic nature made her rather formidable. When she heard that I {{was going to marry}} her niece, she took me in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where I was staying, and sat reading the papers in my room while I dressed. If I happened to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. I never had a moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> first act of a play, and then woke up with a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished to go somewhere else. We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on a chair at the door of her box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered. If by chance, she was awake and felt a draft, she would ask me to bring her such or such a number. I could have put up with all this but unfortunately she had a passion for dancing. At midnight, now wide awake, she would drag me to a night club where she danced till dawn.”The diplomat Maurice Paléologue wrote on 14 October 1913, [...] "Although she is fifty-three, she lives openly with an Argentinian blackguard, dances at Magic City with all comers till two in the morning and associates with the scum of the aerodromes." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me, [...] Afar down I see {{the huge}} first Nothing, I know I was even there, [...] I waited unseen and always, and <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{lethargic}} mist, [...] And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.|$|E

60|$|Little Toomai {{lay back}} and <b>slept</b> all <b>through</b> <b>the</b> long {{afternoon}} {{and into the}} twilight, and while he slept Petersen Sahib and Machua Appa followed the track of the two elephants for fifteen miles across the hills. Petersen Sahib had spent eighteen years in catching elephants, and he had only once before found such a dance-place. Machua Appa {{had no need to}} look twice at the clearing to see what had been done there, or to scratch with his toe in the packed, rammed earth.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a certain}} {{constraint}} at the breakfast table. Mr. Fox had heard the serenades, although his consort had <b>slept</b> soundly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> turmoil; and, while carefully avoiding any reference to the incidents of the night, he was anxiously hoping that somebody would say something about them. Mrs. Easterfield saw that Mr. Du Brant was in a bad humor, and she hoped he was angry enough to announce his early departure. But he contented himself with being angry, and said nothing about going away.|$|R
60|$|He <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> early gray {{of morning}} until the direct {{rays of the}} sun smote his closed eyelids, when he awoke with a start and looked about him until he had {{established}} the continuity of his existence and identified his present self with the days previously lived.|$|E
6000|$|... "You look pale, Adrian," [...] {{said his}} father presently. [...] "I fear that this wild weather kept you awake last night, as it did me, {{although}} at your age I have <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> roar of a battle. Well, have you thought over our conversation? I {{do not wish to}} trouble you with these incessant family matters, but times presses, and it is necessary to decide." ...|$|E
60|$|Early on {{the morning}} after these events the two men, captor and captive, sat in the tent of the former. A table was between them on which lay, among a number of letters, {{official}} and private, which the captain had written during the night, the incriminating papers found upon the spy. That gentleman had <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night in an adjoining tent, unguarded. Both, having breakfasted, were now smoking.|$|E
60|$|As {{one story}} of the kind {{produces}} another, and as all the company seemed fully engrossed by the topic, and disposed to bring their relatives and ancestors upon the scene, there is no knowing how many more ghost adventures we might have heard, had not a corpulent old fox-hunter, who had <b>slept</b> soundly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> whole, now suddenly awakened, with a loud and long-drawn yawn. The sound broke the charm; the ghosts took to flight {{as though it had}} been cock-crowing, and there was a universal move for bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is well to be young!" [...] he exclaimed, as he {{bent over}} Naida's fingers. [...] "You look, my far-away but much beloved cousin, as though you had <b>slept</b> peacefully <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night and spent the morning in this soft, sunlit air, with perhaps, if one might suggest such a thing, an hour at a Bond Street beauty parlour. Here am I with crow's-feet under my eyes and ghosts walking by my side. Yet none the less," [...] he added, as {{the door opened and}} Maggie appeared, [...] "looking forward to my luncheon and to hear all the news." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{question}} was answered by {{a sound of}} bare, pattering feet, and a cry of 'Mamma, mamma!' and my little Marquis himself, with nothing on but his little white shirt and black velvet breeches, his long hair streaming behind him, came and threw himself on me, followed by {{two or three more}} little fellows in the same state of dishabille. 'Oh, mamma!' he cried, 'we thought they were all gone, and had left us to be murdered by the cruel Parliament; and then I saw you from the window in the court.' So there they all were, except one little Count from Burgundy, who <b>slept</b> serenely <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tumult.|$|R
6000|$|The Colonel was {{reaching}} down her handbag; his cheery: [...] "Looks {{as if it}} would be rough!" [...] aroused her. Glad to be alone, and tired enough now, she sought the ladies' cabin, and <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> crossing, till the voice of the old stewardess awakened her: [...] "You've had a nice sleep. We're alongside, miss." [...] Ah! if she were but THAT now! She had been dreaming that she was sitting in a flowery field, and Lennan had drawn her up by the hands, with the words: [...] "We're here, my darling!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And nest-building and egg-laying," [...] Dick laughed. [...] "Never has {{the world}} seemed more fecund than this morning. Lady Isleton is farrowed of eleven. The angoras were brought down this morning for the kidding. You should have seen them. And the wild {{canaries}} have been discussing matrimony in the patio for hours. I think some free lover is trying to break up their monogamic heaven with modern love-theories. It's a wonder you <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> discussion. Listen! There they go now. Is that applause? Or is it a riot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so Mr. Chuck {{slept on}} until the tender young green things began once more to grow. The cold could not reach him, and the fat he had stored under his skin took the place of food. When he awoke in the spring, he knew nothing of the hard times his neighbors were talking about. And ever since then the Chuck family has <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> winter, {{because it is the}} most {{comfortable}} and sensible thing to do. I know, because I {{have done the same thing}} for years. Good-by, Peter Rabbit! No more stories until spring." ...|$|E
60|$|The wind lulled {{as if it}} feared to waken them. Feathery drifts of snow, shaken {{from the}} long pine boughs, flew like white winged birds, and settled about them as they <b>slept.</b> <b>The</b> moon <b>through</b> <b>the</b> rifted clouds looked down upon {{what had been the}} camp. But all human stain, all trace of earthly travail, was hidden beneath the spotless mantle mercifully flung from above.|$|R
50|$|After much fighting, with ups {{and downs}} for Cragger, a mysterious black cloud comes in and runs Mount Cavora dry. There is one big final battle, where Laval fakes his death and the villains gain the upper hand due to their strategy, and outnumbering them, since they bribed the rhinos while <b>the</b> bears <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> it all. <b>The</b> fight ended in Laval, who faked his death, {{bringing}} the legendary Crocodile Legend Beast with Cragger's mother, Crunket, in tow. An estatic Cragger ends the war, but Crunket informs them of dark tribes that want to steal all of their CHI. It has only begun.|$|R
5000|$|They also, {{during this}} period, {{recorded}} their first single, a double A side, single (the first released in New Zealand). The first recording sessions were nominally produced by Tim Finn (although he <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> much of <b>the</b> session) at Harlequin Studios in Mt. Eden, and produced four tracks, {{at the time}} unreleased. The second session a few weeks later, produced by the band and Doug Rogers, re-recorded two of those songs, [...] "Megaton" [...] and [...] "Desert Patrol", and these, after some gestation came out on Phonogram's Vertigo label in January 1978, selling about 500 copies at the time.|$|R
60|$|With a great {{resolve to}} destroy the will he went to bed, and <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night as best he could. In the dark of his chamber, when the candle was out, {{and he was not}} yet {{protected}} by his bed, there came a qualm upon him. But the deed was not yet done, and the qualm was kept under, and he slept. He even repeated the Lord's Prayer to himself when he was under the clothes, struggling, however, as he did so, not to bring home to himself that petition as to the leading into temptation and the deliverance from evil.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{came the}} moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime words, [...] "The peace of God, which passeth all understanding," [...] seemed to blend with the calm {{afternoon}} sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the bonnets of the little maidens who had <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sermon, the fathers collecting the prayer-books, until all streamed out through the old archway into the green churchyard and began their neighbourly talk, their simple civilities, and their invitations to tea; for on a Sunday every one was ready to receive a guest--it was the day when all must be in their best clothes and their best humour.|$|E
60|$|He <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> whole day, and at night, falling {{early in}} the shadows of the forest which {{thickened}} over his retreat, he supped, as he had breakfasted, on the wild berries and spring water, but with protesting from a stomach habitually flattered by the luxury of fried chicken and ham, and corn-pone and shortened biscuit, and hot coffee, which his adorers put before him when he laid aside his divinity and descended to the gratification of his carnal greed. He was a gross feeder, and in the midst of his fear and the joy of his escape, he thought of these things and lusted for them with a sort of thankless resentment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most famous}} part of Goldberg's {{life is the}} portion, {{probably}} in 1741, recounted by J.S. Bach's biographer Johann Nikolaus Forkel, which involved the composition {{of a set of}} variations by Bach as a soporific to help the insomniac Count Keyserlingk fall asleep. Keyserlingk's favorite chamber harpsichordist was the 14-year-old Goldberg, whose technical accomplishments were so spectacular that they made it possible for him to perform a work of such extraordinary difficulty. Whether <b>the</b> count actually <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> performances of <b>the</b> piece is not recorded, but he did indicate that Bach's composition was a great favorite of his. According to Forkel, writing in 1802, sixty years after the event: ...|$|R
50|$|This task {{featured}} male models Daniel Lake, Tommy Maxwell, Matthew McDonough and Eric Monjoin. For {{the first}} part each contestant was paired up with a male model and had to hug and touch each other {{to get used to}} the closeness for the photoshoots. The second part was a challenge set by Alenka. The challenge was for each couple to star in an advert, advertising a fake brand ice cream, Pang's Ice cream (names after Jonathan Pang, their mentor). Kellie struggled the most as she was told to speak, when she was more comfortable signing. She argued that British Sign Language is her language and Sophie was allowed her wheelchair on the catwalk task, why shouldn't she be allowed to sign? By learning that models used in adverts are sometimes dubbed, she did two adverts - she spoke in one, and signed in <b>the</b> other. Jessica <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> most <b>the</b> rehearsal due to her ME.|$|R
