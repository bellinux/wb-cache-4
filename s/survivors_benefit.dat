40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{costs and benefits}} of the Military <b>Survivors</b> <b>Benefit</b> Plan (SBP) were studied. The present value of the expected lifetime costs and benefits were estimated for the SBP for various initial base amounts, rates of inflation, and retirement ages. It was found that the ratio of costs to benefits of the SBP increases as the base amount increases above the minimum allowable base. A life insurance plan yielding a lifetime stream of benefits comparable to the SBP was developed and the lifetime costs and benefits were estimated using the same rate of discount, initial base amounts, rates of inflation, and retirement ages as were utilized for the SBP study. The ratio of costs to benefits of the SBP and the life insurance plan were compared and conclusions regarding {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each plan were drawn from the emperical results.

40|$|Literature {{about the}} {{psychological}} consequences of stroke in those under 65 is reviewed focussing on services and work. Despite similarities, {{young and old}} survivors have different experiences and needs. These are attributable {{to the effects of}} stroke on age-normative roles and activities, self-image, and the young person’s stage in the life-cycle, especially family and work. “Hidden” cognitive impairments, a disrupted sense of self, and the incongruity of suffering an “older person’s” disease are salient. Young <b>survivors</b> <b>benefit</b> from services, but experience lack of congruence between their needs and service philosophy,methods, and aims, and consequently have unmet needs. Employment is psychologically salient, and the evidence about return rates, factors that affect return, and the adequacy of employment-related service provision is reviewed.

40|$|Stroke {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{disabling}} conditions which may result in the inability for survivors to care for themselves independently. Stroke <b>survivors</b> <b>benefit</b> most when they receive early onset assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation. Increasingly, stroke care in Canadian hospitals relies on an interdisciplinary rehabilitation team approach to provide immediate rehabilitation services and to make decisions about discharge destination for stroke survivors. Currently, there is little research on how interdisciplinary rehabilitation teams decide upon rehabilitation placements for stroke survivors or how individuals on the team, stroke survivors, or their families participate in and contribute to this decision. This research studied the culture of the interdisciplinary rehabilitation team to understand the specific client, clinical, and family situations considered by team members and how that information was communicated and evaluated by them during their decision-making. To address the research question, the researcher undertook an ethnographic study of a health care team on a stroke unit of a Canadian hospital. Based on observations of the interdisciplinary rehabilitation team and interviews with team members, the study found that decisions about post-hospital discharge destination were conditioned by variables related to the social, economic, and policy context; interactions among members of the team; and the condition of stroke survivors or their families and their ability and willingness to contribute to home care...|$|E
40|$|Adverse health {{outcomes}} are {{often seen in}} breast cancer survivors due to prolonged treatment with side effects such as loss of energy and lack of physical strength. Physical activity (PA) has been proposed as an adequate intervention for women with breast cancer. Therefore, this review summarizes the effects of physical activity on breast cancer survivors after diagnosis. We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar for articles published between January 1980 and May 2013. We included a variety of studies such as randomized controlled trials, pilot studies, and clinical trials. We reviewed these studies for three major outcomes: changes in breast cancer mortality, physiological functions, and metabolic biomarkers. Of 127 studies, 33 studies were selected as eligible studies. These studies included physical activities of varying type, duration, frequency, and intensity (e. g., aerobic and resistance training) and examined changes in three major outcomes among breast cancer survivors. Many of the studies suggest that breast cancer <b>survivors</b> <b>benefit</b> from engaging in physical activity, but some studies were limited {{in their ability to}} provide adequate evidence due to relatively small sample sizes, short intervention periods, or high attrition. Based on epidemiological evidence, recent studies demonstrated that those breast cancer survivors who engaged in physical activity significantly lowered their risk of breast cancer mortality and improved their physiological and immune functions. Some studies demonstrated changes in metabolic biomarkers such as insulin and insulin-like growth factors. However...|$|E
40|$|Background: Care of the {{gynecologic}} cancer survivor extends beyond cancer treatment to encompass pro-motion of sexual, cardiovascular, bone, and brain health; management of fertility, contraception, and vasomotor symptoms; and genetic counseling. Methods: This is a narrative {{review of the}} data and guidelines regarding care and surveillance of the gyne-cologic cancer survivor. We searched databases including PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus using the search terms {{gynecologic cancer}}, cancer surveillance, and cancer survivor and reached a consensus for articles chosen {{for inclusion in the}} review based on availability in the English language and publication since 2001, as well as key older articles, consensus statements, and practice guidelines from professional societies. However, we did not undertake an extensive systematic search of the literature to identify all potentially relevant studies, nor did we utilize statistical methods to summarize data. We offer clinical recommendations for the management of gynecologic cancer survivors based on review of evidence and our collective clinical experience. Results: Key messages include the limitations of laboratory studies, including CA- 125, and imaging in the setting of gynecologic cancer surveillance, hormonal and non-hormonal management of treatment-related vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary syndrome of menopause, as well as recommendations for general health screening, fertility preservation, and contraception. Conclusions: A holistic approach to care extending beyond cancer treatment alone benefits gynecologic cancer survivors. In addition to surveillance for cancer recurrence and late treatment side effects, <b>survivors</b> <b>benefit</b> from guidance on hormonal, contraceptive, and fertility management and promotion of cardiovascular, bone, brain, and sexual health...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy and outcome of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis (LG-AS). BackgroundPatients with LG-AS have a poor prognosis with medical treatment and a high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. MethodsBetween January 2009 and June 2010, a total of 1, 302 patients underwent TAVI for severe AS and were prospectively included in the multicenter German TAVI registry. ResultsLG-AS was present in 149 patients (11. 4 %; mean age: 80. 2 ± 6. 3 years). In this subgroup, the EuroSCORE was significantly higher (26. 8 ± 16. 6 vs. 20. 0 ± 13. 3; p < 0. 0001) compared with patients with high-gradient AS (HG-AS). The procedural success rate (LG-AS: 95. 3 % vs. HG-AS: 97. 5 %; p = 0. 13) and the rate of TAVI-associated complications were comparable in both groups (new pacemaker: 27. 0 % vs. 28. 1 %; p = 0. 76; cerebrovascular events: 3. 4 % vs. 3. 1 %, p = 0. 83). However, post-operative low-output syndrome occurred more frequently in the LG-AS-group (LG-AS: 14. 9 % vs. HG-AS: 5. 7 %, p < 0. 0001), and mortality at 30 days and 1 year was significantly higher in this subgroup (LG-AS: 12. 8 % and 36. 9 % vs. HG-AS: 7. 4 % and 18. 1 %; p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 0001, respectively). Post-operative New York Heart Association functional class improved, and self-assessed quality of life increased significantly, demonstrating a substantial benefit in the LG-AS group at 30 days and 1 year after TAVI. ConclusionsIn high-risk patients with LG-AS, TAVI is associated with a significantly higher mortality at 30 days and at 1 year. However, long-term <b>survivors</b> <b>benefit</b> from TAVI with functional improvement and a significantly increased quality of life. Therefore, in view of the poor prognosis with medical treatment, TAVI should be considered an option in high-risk patients with LG-AS...|$|E

40|$|A {{household}} or an organization’s environment {{establishes the}} structure for how decisions are made, {{this means that}} the environment can influence happiness or success over time. The studies comprising this dissertation demonstrate that small changes to a complex decision-making environment’s structure can have substantial effects on long-term outcomes. In the first chapter, I consider how Social Security’s spouse and <b>survivor</b> <b>benefits</b> alter the work incentives of household members. In 2011, Social Security’s Spouse and <b>Survivor’s</b> <b>Benefits</b> amounted to $ 112 billion. I estimate how responsive individuals’ retirement decisions are to Spouse and <b>Survivor’s</b> <b>Benefits.</b> I develop a structural life-cycle model of household savings, labor supply, and benefit claiming. I find that husbands and wives respond sharply to changes in the <b>Survivor’s</b> <b>Benefit,</b> but little to changes in the Spouse’s Benefit. In addition, the annuity provided by the <b>Survivor’s</b> <b>Benefit,</b> even if reduced, creates a strong incentive for the couple’s high earner to continue working. In the second chapter, I document the rise in old-age divorce, and examine the impact of divorce and widowhood after age 50 on individuals’ labor force decisions. I find that female labor force participation increases by up to 17. 1 percentage points in the eight years following divorce, compared with an insignificant decline in work amongst widows. Among women, I am able to attribute most of the immediate labor supply response to asset losses during divorce. A business environment often contains complex, interdependent activities that create and sustain a firm’s competitive advantage. In the third chapter, I find that incorporating complementarities within these interdependencies can alter the speed and success of an organization’s decision-making structure in adapting to changes in complex business environments...|$|R

25|$|Despite its {{regressive}} tax formula, Social Security benefits are calculated using a progressive benefit formula that replaces {{a much higher}} percentage of low-income workers' pre-retirement income than that of higher-income workers (although these low-income workers pay {{a higher percentage of}} their pre-retirement income). Supporters of the current system also point to numerous studies that show that, relative to high-income workers, Social Security disability and <b>survivor</b> <b>benefits</b> paid on behalf of low-income workers more than offset any retirement benefits that may be lost because of shorter life expectancy (this offset would only apply at a population level). Other research asserts that <b>survivor</b> <b>benefits,</b> allegedly an offset, actually exacerbate the problem because <b>survivor</b> <b>benefits</b> are denied to single individuals, including widow(er)s married fewer than nine months (except in certain situations), divorced widow(er)s married fewer than 10 years, and co-habiting or same-sex couples, unless they are legally married in their state of residence.
