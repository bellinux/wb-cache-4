50|$|The two bikes use {{the same}} bodywork, {{including}} the fuel tank. With {{the exception of the}} steering damper mount, the frame between the bikes is the same, which results in identical wheelbase and rake and trail numbers. The second generation 848 Evo features the same monoblock brakes and the same frame with the steering damper mount as the 1098/1198.

50|$|The {{method of}} {{determining}} the anti-dive or anti-squat depends on whether the <b>suspension</b> <b>linkages</b> react to the torque of braking and accelerating.

50|$|To {{determine}} {{the percentage of}} front suspension braking anti-dive for outboard brakes, {{it is first necessary}} to {{determine the}} tangent of the angle between a line drawn, in side view, through the front tire patch and the front suspension instant center, and the horizontal. In addition, the percentage of braking effort at the front wheels must be known. Then, multiply the tangent by the front wheel braking effort percentage and divide by the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. A value of 50% would mean that half of the weight transfer to the front wheels, during braking, is being transmitted through the front <b>suspension</b> <b>linkage</b> and half is being transmitted through the front suspension springs.|$|E
5000|$|Forward {{acceleration}} anti-squat {{is calculated}} {{in a similar}} manner and with the same relationship between percentage and weight transfer. Anti-squat values of 100% and more are commonly used in drag racing, but values of 50% or less are more common in cars that have to undergo severe braking. Higher values of anti-squat commonly cause wheel hop during braking. It is important to note that, while the value of 100% means that all of the weight transfer is being carried through the <b>suspension</b> <b>linkage.</b> However, {{this does not mean that}} the suspension is incapable of carrying additional loads (aerodynamic, cornering, etc.) during an episode of braking or forward acceleration. In other words, no [...] "binding" [...] of the suspension is to be implied.|$|E
50|$|Stiction {{refers to}} the {{characteristic}} of stop and start type motion as a force overcomes static friction and causes a part to accelerate under dynamic friction, but the force cannot {{keep up with the}} speed of the moving part so the part tends to stop again until the force catches up, and it happens repeatedly. Stiction is a problem for the design and materials science of many moving linkages. This is particularly the case for linear sliding joints, rather than rotating pivots. Owing to simple geometry, the moving distance of a sliding joint in two comparable linkages is longer than the circumferential travel of a pivoting bearing, thus the forces involved (for equivalent work) are lower and stiction forces become proportionally more significant. This issue has often led to linkages being redesigned from sliding to purely pivoted structures, just to avoid problems with stiction. An example is the Chapman strut, a <b>suspension</b> <b>linkage</b> developed by Colin Chapman of Lotus cars.|$|E

The design procedure specifies the vehicle chassis orientation and the tire camber angles of the vehicle when cornering. As well, two task positions of the wheels {{with respect to the}} chassis are specified for suspension movement in straightaways.

However, when introduced for its first race, the 1982 Monaco Grand Prix, the team was forced by race officials to remove {{a portion of the}} skirts with a resulting loss of downforce that affected the cars' performance. The team used the JS17B, with which it had started the first five races of the season, for the following races in the United States and Canada while the aerodynamics of the JS19 were reworked in wind tunnel testing. A single JS19 was present for the Dutch and British races while the other was in the wind tunnel. Two cars were present from the French Grand Prix onwards.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interesting}} {{rear suspension}} permits independent action of each wheel. Vertical {{movements of the}} wheels are controlled by two links, in which the upper link doubles as the axle shaft; and a rod, rubber bushed on each end as the lower. A third link runs from each rear wheel hub forward to the frame to transmit driving and braking thrust. Variable rate coil springs unitized with direct, double-acting shock absorbers are diagonally mounted at each rear wheel. Adjustment provisions in the rear <b>suspension</b> <b>linkage</b> permit variations in camber and toe-in to facilitate engineering studies. Front suspension is independent with high roll center geometry, and also utilizes unitized variable rate coil springs and shock absorbers as in the rear suspension. An 11/16" [...] stabilizer bar interconnects the front wheels. The independent rear suspension design became {{the basis of the}} 1963 Corvette Sting Ray suspension. So that weight distribution during tests shall vary little if any, two fuel cells of rubber construction and total capacity of 20 gallons, are located {{on either side of the}} [...] "CERV-I" [...] at approximately the fore and aft location of the center of gravity. Thus, the amount of fuel in the tanks at any given moment will have virtually no effect on weight distribution.|$|E

Bouchut, Dumbreck, and Heidfeld in the No. 5 and Lagorce, Lamy, and Schneider in the No. 6 entries would have to pre-qualify for the event, while No. 4 was free to use the pre-qualifying session for testing purposes. Pre-qualifying involved all 62 entry applicant teams setting lap times over a long session. The final entry for Le Mans would be made of 48 cars, combining guaranteed entries and the fastest cars in pre-qualifying within their respective classes; the prototype category, combining LMP and LMGTP cars, only allowed 28 cars from 31 entries. Competitors in the prototype category for 1999 included factory-supported LMGTP programmes from Toyota and Audi, and LMP entries from Nissan, BMW, Audi, and Panoz. Toyota set the fastest pre-qualifying time overall, followed by Panoz and BMW. Mercedes No. 6 was the sixth fastest car, while Nos. 4 and 5 were 14th and 15th respectively.

A parametric sensitivity analysis is further carried out to investigate the influence of seat cushion parameters on the vibration transmission performance of the seat-human body model. Developments in dynamic seats (suspension seats) are briefly reviewed with special emphasis on their vibration attenuation performance.

5000|$|One {{limitation}} of any keel design is that, while the keel influence may vary, the <b>suspension</b> <b>linkages</b> themselves still disrupt the underbody airflow. This problem was exacerbated when the FIA introduced rule changes in [...] that forced teams to mount their front wing {{in a more}} elevated position. In response to this, many F1 teams have developed zero-keel chassis designs. Here the keel is removed entirely, and the suspension is mounted directly to the chassis. As the nose cone is in a raised position, this entails that the suspension arms take a distinctly inclined angle {{with respect to the}} road surface, reducing suspension efficiency. However, with continued restrictions to aerodynamic downforce through the use of aerofoil wings, and the lighter V8 engines specified from 2006 onwards causing weight distribution to shift forward, many designers apparently consider this drawback to be less significant than the concomitant increase in venturi downforce generated underneath the car; except for Renault and Red Bull, all of the teams in the 2007 Formula One World Championship used a zero-keel design.|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} student CFD {{project has}} been conducted on the 2006 Chalmers Formula SAE car. The purpose was two folded; first to predict and improve the general aerodynamic design of the vehicle and second to create a showcase demonstrating the benefit of using a CFD tool in an automotive project, run by newcomers, with a short time span and a limited budget. The general aerodynamic design of the vehicle was evaluated; lift and drag coefficients were first predicted without devices for downforce generation. As a second step, a set of wings and diffuser were developed for this specific car design. Lift and drag forces were determined for this set up as well. It was found and recommended, not to incorporate wings in the original car design. However, improvements could be obtained by using ground effect devices, such as a diffuser. In order to introduce these devices, significant changes {{had to be made}} on the <b>suspension</b> <b>linkage</b> to prevent diffuser separation.

40|$|Ambulance {{suspensions}} often give a poor ride {{which may}} result in deterioration in the condition of ill or injured patients. To reduce patient vibration, purpose-built ambulances or ambulances with modified chassis can be used. A potentially lower cost and more effective alternative is to provide additional isolation for the stretcher only. This thesis describes the design and performance of a pneumatic stretcher suspension which uses a novel linkage to provide isolation in bounce and pitch. Results of linear and non-linear analyses are presented which characterise the behaviour of the suspension. The kinematics of the <b>suspension</b> <b>linkage</b> are shown to give to a vertical stiffness which reduces in compression. Pneumatic cylinders connected to auxiliary tanks are used as springs. These give the suspension essentially load-independent natural frequencies of around 0. 46 Hz in bounce and pitch. Damping is provided by fitting a flow restriction between the cylinders and tanks. By simulating {{the response of the}} stretcher to realistic random floor vibrations, it is concluded that a low level of damping is required and that an orifice restriction is preferable to a capillary restriction. These simulations are {{believed to be the first}} for which pneumatic damping is assessed by using a realistic random input. Additional simulation results demonstrate that improved isolation is possib 1 e by using an innovative semi-active pneumatic damper which is controlled according to the skyhook damping principle. A mechanical shaker which uses adjustable stroke round cams is described. Suspension tests carried out using this shaker are detailed. Various combinations of patient mass, pneumatic damping level, and shaker stroke and frequency are used. Acceleration transmissibilities are presented which indicate both that good levels of vertical isolation are obtained (eg. greater than 90 % isolation above 5. 2 Hz), and that isolation performance is largely independent of patient mass. Coulomb damping is shown to have a detrimental effect on isolation - particularly for low acceleration or high frequency inputs. The results of road tests are presented. These show that the suspension provides isolation above 1 Hz and reduces r. m. s. accelerations by 45 - 60 %. The suspension is concluded to offer the potential to reduce patient vibration at reasonable cost, although improvements to the design are required in moving to a production model...|$|E

50|$|CFRP bicycle frames weigh {{less than}} one of steel, aluminum, or {{titanium}} for the same strength. The type and orientation of the carbon-fiber weave can be designed to maximize stiffness in required directions. Frames can be tuned to address different riding styles: sprint events require stiffer frames while endurance events may require more flexible frames for rider comfort over longer periods. The variety of shapes it can be built into has further increased stiffness and also allowed aerodynamic tube sections. CFRP forks including suspension fork crowns and steerers, handlebars, seatposts, and crank arms are becoming more common on medium as well as higher-priced bicycles. CFRP rims remain expensive but their stability compared to aluminium reduces the need to re-true a wheel and the reduced mass reduces the moment of inertia of the wheel. CFRP spokes are rare and most carbon wheelsets retain traditional stainless steel spokes. CFRP also appears increasingly in other components such as derailleur parts, brake and shifter levers and bodies, cassette sprocket carriers, <b>suspension</b> <b>linkages,</b> disc brake rotors, pedals, shoe soles, and saddle rails. Although strong and light, impact, over-torquing or improper installation of CFRP components has resulted in cracking and failures, which may be difficult or impossible to repair.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{computer-aided}} modelling analysis {{and design of}} vehicle systems for ride and handling studies. Characteristics of vehicle multi-body models are identified and formalisms are developed for automatic computerized equation generation and solution. These are implemented using interactive graphics and applied to several vehicle dynamics studies. The method of velocity coefficients is proposed as a versatile tool to model and analyze <b>suspension</b> <b>linkages</b> for ride and handling. The velocity coefficients can be evaluated from a kinematic analysis and then used to characterize a <b>linkage</b> <b>suspension</b> as a linkage-free suspension of equivalent isolation and handling properties. Dynamic analysis can then be carried out without solving for the kinematics at each integration step, leading to efficient solution. When the suspensions are represented as force-generating elements, most vehicle models can be represented by free-multi-body systems or multi-body systems in tree configuration. For these systems, a computer-based modelling strategy is formulated which parallels the intuitive and customary techniques used by vehicle system dynamicists. In this scheme, each rigid body may have any number of degrees of freedom between 1 and 6. The implicit constraints are automatically taken care of in the formulation so that a minimal set of differential equations are generated. General purpose formulations are presented for the velocity coefficient and design sensitivity analysis of suspensions. A general analytical method has been derived to determine the vehicle roll stiffness and roll centre location, which has hitherto been done graphically. Some prevalent misconceptions regarding roll centre arising from the geographical construction, and compounded by an official SAE definition, have been clarified. Implementation of the formalisms developed {{is presented in the}} form of two pieces of software [...] GENKAD and CAMSYD. GENKAD is a comprehensive set of programs for the kinematic analysis and design of planar mechanisms, featuring automatic symbolic equation derivation.
