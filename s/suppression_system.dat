5|$|While K-152 Nerpa was {{undergoing}} sea trials in the Sea of Japan on 8 November 2008, a fire <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> was accidentally initiated. The accident killed 20 civilian specialists and navy crew members and injured 21 others.|$|E
5|$|The class {{incorporates}} {{some major}} features including {{but not limited}} to the 'X'-shaped hull form to improve stealth, a raft-mounted propulsion system to reduce vibration, and an infrared signature <b>suppression</b> <b>system.</b> It also includes networks such as the Total Atmospheric Control System (TACS), Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS), Integrated Bridge System (IBS), Battle Damage Control System (BDCS) and Personnel Locator System (PLS). The ships also include technology that enables them to fight in Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) warfare scenarios. The Indian Navy claims that the indigenization achieved in these ships is about 90%.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was given the}} service designation of MiG-9 (internal OKB designations of I-301 and izdeliye FS) and a small batch of ten aircraft, equipped with original German engines, was ordered during 1946 from Factory No. 1 in Kazan before flight testing was completed. They were intended {{to be used in}} the parade, but bad weather forced the cancellation of their flypast. Two of them were assigned to participate in the state acceptance trials while others were used as testbeds for various programs. The trials were concluded in June and the MiG-9 generally met the performance goals set by the Council of People's Commissars. The test pilots found the fighter easy and simple to fly. Defects noted during testing were that the engines flamed out when firing the cannon at high altitudes due to gun gas ingestion, no ejection seat was fitted, nor were air brakes or a fire <b>suppression</b> <b>system.</b> The fuel tanks were not self-sealing and no armor was provided for the pilot. Despite these drawbacks, the MiG-9 was ordered into production at Factory No. 1 before the acceptance tests were completed as the Soviet leadership believed that its shortcomings could be rectified during production. A batch of 50 aircraft, 40 single-seat fighters and 10 two-seat trainers, were ordered in late 1946 to participate in the 1947 May Day parade. In recognition of their accomplishment Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich were awarded the Stalin Prize in 1947.|$|E

25|$|The Space Shuttle generates 180dB {{of noise}} around its base. To combat this, NASA {{developed}} a sound <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> which can flow water at rates up to 900,000 gallons per minute (57m3/s) onto the launch pad. The water reduces {{the noise level}} from 180dB down to 142dB (the design requirement is 145dB). Without the sound <b>suppression</b> <b>system,</b> acoustic waves reflect off of the launch pad towards the rocket, vibrating the sensitive payload and crew. These acoustic waves can be so severe that they can destroy the rocket.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, leaking {{aviation}} gasoline accumulating {{in the forward}} elevator pit began vaporising and soon permeated {{the upper and lower}} hangar decks. The danger this posed to the ship was readily apparent to the damage control crews but, whether through inadequate training, lack of practice (only three months had passed since the ship's commissioning) or general incompetence, their response to it proved fatally ineffectual. Efforts to pump out the damaged elevator well were bungled and no one thought to try to cover the increasingly lethal mixture with foam from the hangar's fire <b>suppression</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

Earlier versions of the LOKh system only operate under manual control from the duty shift console.

According to the testimony of an engineer from the Zvezda shipyard, this had malfunctioned before while the submarine was being readied for its sea trials. Some commentators speculated that the system could have been accidentally activated by cigarette smoke.|$|E

25|$|On 27 January 1959, Sisu {{arrived in}} Rauma {{to have one}} of her {{generators}} repaired. Late in the evening, a faulty radiator in one of the cabins started a fire that quickly spread in the aft part of the vessel. While it was brought under control within three hours through the co-operative effort of the city fire department, a local volunteer fire department and three industrial fire brigades from nearby factories, the fire and water destroyed six cabins and damaged the vessel's electric system, turning gear and aft propulsion motors. However, the main engine room was protected by a carbon dioxide fire <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> and the excessive use of water prevented the fuel oil tanks below the main deck from exploding. Although the vessel was fully crewed and part of the crew was sleeping, no-one was injured in the fire. Sisu returned to service after extensive repairs on 26 April 1959.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{management}} and acoustic noise reduction would be utilized to avoid detection. The vehicle {{would be able}} to avoid threats by laying obscurants. An array of hit avoidance systems would be leveraged and the Army offered the various active protection systems developed for the manned ground vehicle program. The GCV enabled the detection and neutralization of mines at standoff ranges. The vehicle was also to be equipped with an engagement detection system. The Army required the IFV to have the passive blast protection level equal to the MRAP. The Army made available the composition of the armor of the manned ground vehicle program. A transparent armor shield would provide protection for the vehicle commander when exposed through the turret. Personnel would leverage harnesses and restraints to mitigate trauma. In addition, a Vehicle Health Management System would provide vehicle diagnostic monitoring systems for commanders. A fire <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> and ammunition detonation protection would be utilized for damage control.|$|E
25|$|Before launch, two Captive Firing Tests were {{conducted}} on the rocket which was to launch HTV-1. The first test, which consisted of firing the first stage for ten seconds, was originally scheduled to occur at 02:30 UTC on 27 March 2009, however it was cancelled after the launch pad's coolant system failed to activate. This was later discovered to {{have been due to}} a manual supply valve not being open. The test was rescheduled for 1 April, but then postponed again due to a leak in a pipe associated with the launch facility's fire <b>suppression</b> <b>system.</b> The test was rescheduled for 2 April, when it was successfully conducted at 05:00 UTC. Following this, the second test, which involved a 150-second burn of the first stage, was scheduled for 20 April. This was successfully conducted at 04:00 UTC on 22 April, following a two-day delay due to unfavourable weather conditions. A ground test, using a battleship mockup of the rocket was subsequently conducted on 11 July.|$|E
