5|$|Many animals, {{including}} moths, butterflies, mantises, phasmids, and cephalopods such as octopuses, {{make use}} of patterns of threatening or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, so as to <b>scare</b> <b>off</b> or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals such as}} many moths, mantises and grasshoppers, have a {{repertory}} {{of threatening}} or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots or patches of bright and contrasting colours, so as to <b>scare</b> <b>off</b> or momentarily distract a predator. This gives the prey animal an opportunity to escape. The behaviour is deimatic (startling) rather than aposematic as these insects are palatable to predators, so the warning colours are a bluff, not an honest signal.|$|E
5|$|Cagney became {{president}} of the Screen Actors Guild in 1942 for a two-year term. He took a role in the Guild's fight against the Mafia, which had begun to take an active interest in the movie industry. His wife, Billie Vernon, once received a phone call telling her that Cagney was dead. Cagney alleged that, having failed to <b>scare</b> <b>off</b> the Guild and him, they sent a hitman to kill him by dropping a heavy light onto his head. Upon hearing of the rumor of a hit, George Raft made a call, and the hit was supposedly canceled.|$|E

5|$|Territorial {{males are}} very site-faithful; 90% {{return to the}} same lekking sites in {{subsequent}} seasons, the most dominant males being {{the most likely to}} reappear. Site-faithful males can acquire accurate information about the competitive abilities of other males, leading to well-developed dominance relationships. Such stable relationships reduce conflict and the risk of injury, and the consequent lower levels of male aggression are less likely to <b>scare</b> <b>off</b> females. Lower-ranked territorial males also benefit from site fidelity since they can remain on the leks while waiting for the top males eventually to drop out.|$|E
5|$|At first Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang {{is just a}} big and {{powerful}} car, but as the book progresses the car surprises the family by beginning to exhibit independent actions. This first happens while the family is caught in a traffic jam {{on their way to}} the beach for a picnic. The car suddenly instructs Commander Pott to pull a switch which causes Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang to sprout wings and take flight over the stopped cars on the road. Commander Pott flies them to Goodwin Sands in the English Channel where the family picnics, swims, and sleeps. While the family naps, the tide comes in threatening to drown them. Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang wakes them just in time with a hiss of steam. At the car's direction, Commander Pott pulls another switch which causes it to transform into a hovercraft-like vehicle. They make for the French coast and land on a beach near Calais. They explore along the beach and find a cave boobytrapped with some devices intended to <b>scare</b> <b>off</b> intruders. At the back of the cave is a store of armaments and explosives. The family detonates the cache of explosives and flees the cave.|$|E
5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the door that led to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, the clown identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room and began to walk towards him. When the clown was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the clown had done this to <b>scare</b> <b>off</b> one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E

25|$|A deimatic {{displays}} is {{a pattern}} of threatening or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, used to <b>scare</b> <b>off</b> or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. For example, some moths look threatening while at rest by displaying a sinister lurking face, {{such as those of}} genus Speiredonia, or the more aggressive face of a snake poised to attack, such as many species of genus Spirama. Adult Atlas moths of the genera Attacus and Rothschildia also display snake heads. The eyed hawkmoth displays its large eyespots on its wings and moves them slowly {{as if it were a}} vertebrate predator such as an owl.|$|E
25|$|After Survivor Series, McMahon left Raw {{to focus}} his {{attention}} on the executive creative staff and on his new family.

On a special 3-hour episode of Raw in October 2005, billed as WWE Homecoming, all four members of the McMahon family were given a Stone Cold Stunner by Stone Cold Steve Austin. The following week, Vince demanded an apology from ringside commentators for not coming to his family's aid, which developed into a new feud. McMahon also appeared at Survivor Series, though he did not appear on television.

25|$|In {{the biblical}} Joseph narrative, when Joseph, having settled in Egypt, asks his {{brothers}} to bring Benjamin to him, he takes Simeon hostage {{to ensure that}} they return. According to classical rabbinical sources, Joseph chose Simeon to be the hostage because he was concerned that if Simeon wasn't separated from Levi, then Levi and Simeon might destroy Egypt together, since they had already destroyed Shechem. Another theory was that Joseph singled out Simeon due to his taking a prominent role in Joseph's betrayal, however Driscoll points out that {{there is no mention of}} this in the narrative. According to the midrashic book of Jasher, Simeon wasn't willing to become a hostage, so Joseph sent 70 strong Egyptians to take Simeon by force, but Simeon had a very powerful voice, and so was able to <b>scare</b> <b>off</b> the Egyptians simply by shouting. The text states that Simeon was eventually subdued by Manasseh, and imprisoned. The Testament of Simeon, on the other hand, declares that Simeon acknowledged that it was just for him to be imprisoned, given his earlier mistreatment of Joseph, and so he went willingly.|$|E
