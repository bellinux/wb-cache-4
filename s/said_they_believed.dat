Of anal and vaginal sex, 14% believed one could engage in the former and 12% said one could participate in the latter while still remaining abstinent.|$|E
25|$|In January 2016, President Obama sent a {{directive}} to the Pentagon {{to make it}} easier for the military to get approval for strikes in Afghanistan, targeting militias that have sworn allegiance to the Islamic State. For 3 weeks in that month, the United States military carried out at least a dozen operations, including commando raids and airstrikes, many of these raids and strikes taking place in the Tora Bora region of Nangarhar Province. American commanders in Afghanistan <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that between 90 and 100 Islamic State militants had been killed in these recent operations.|$|E
25|$|The two {{vehicles}} {{with the group}} of whites pulled off the freeway and into the motel parking lot. The group <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that Anderson was trying to steal a vehicle because they saw him trying to break into one. The vehicle was Anderson's own; {{he had lost his}} keys. The group repeatedly beat Anderson and robbed him, the district attorney said, citing reports from witnesses. Video from a motel security camera shows the perpetrators entering and leaving the picture frame; it did not capture the beating. One witness reported that one of the perpetrators yelled, “white power,” when returning to his truck after the beating.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prison is}} split into 3 sections, the first opening in February 2017 {{and the other}} two {{expected}} before the autumn.

25|$|In June 2010, German {{scientists}} <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> {{there was}} evidence that he had died of sickle cell disease. Other experts, however, rejected the hypothesis of homozygous sickle cell disease based on survival beyond the age of 5 {{and the location of}} the osteonecrosis, which is characteristic of Freiberg-Kohler syndrome rather than sickle-cell disease. Research conducted in 2005 by archaeologists, radiologists, and geneticists, who performed CT scans on the mummy, found that he was not killed by a blow to the head, as previously thought. New CT images discovered congenital flaws, which are more common among the children of incest. Siblings are more likely to pass on twin copies of deleterious alleles, which is why children of incest more commonly manifest genetic defects. It is suspected he also had a partially cleft palate, another congenital defect.|$|E
25|$|Also on September 10, DNI Mike McConnell {{testified before}} the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs that the Protect America Act had helped foil a major terror plot in Germany. U.S. intelligence-community {{officials}} questioned the accuracy of McConnell's testimony and urged his office to correct it, which he did in a statement issued September 12, 2007. Critics cited the incident {{as an example of}} the Bush administration's exaggerated claims and contradictory statements about surveillance activities. Counterterrorism officials familiar with the background of McConnell's testimony said they did not believe he made inaccurate statements intentionally as part of any strategy by the administration to persuade Congress to make the new eavesdropping law permanent. Those officials <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> McConnell gave the wrong answer because he was overwhelmed with information and merely mixed up his facts.|$|E
25|$|Some {{privately owned}} and state {{broadcast}} stations provided overtly biased, unbalanced, or false election coverage favoring certain candidates. The HAM sanctioned state and privately owned broadcast stations {{during the campaign}} for inciting ethnic hatred or violence and for violating media regulations intended to ensure balanced electoral reporting. The HAM sanctioned stations favoring Vice President Bemba more frequently than stations favoring President Kabila, and most observers <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that pro-Kabila stations also violated the media code of conduct and were sanctioned, {{but they did not}} commit as many infractions as pro-Bemba stations did (see section 2.a.). On numerous occasions during the campaign, broadcast stations owned by Bemba or his supporters promoted ethnic hatred. Vice President Bemba's campaign used ethnic slurs in reference to President Kabila and alleged that Kabila, who spent part of his youth outside the country, was a foreigner.|$|E

25|$|Managed {{care plans}} are widely {{credited}} with subduing medical cost inflation {{in the late}} 1980s by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, forcing providers to discount their rates, and causing {{the health care industry}} to become more efficient and competitive. Managed care plans and strategies proliferated and quickly became nearly ubiquitous in the U.S. However, this rapid growth led to a consumer backlash. Because many managed care health plans are provided by for-profit companies, their cost-control efforts created widespread perception that they were more interested in saving money than providing health care. In a 2004 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a majority of those polled <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that managed care decreased the time doctors spend with patients, made it harder for people who are sick to see specialists, and had failed to produce significant health care savings. These public perceptions have been fairly consistent in polling since 1997.|$|E
25|$|Discussion of {{the racial}} {{elements}} of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and some commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to be suspicious of the credibility and fairness of {{the police and the}} courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After the civil trial verdict against Simpson, most whites surveyed <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that most black people now think O.J. was guilty.|$|E

5000|$|A 2010 80-questions mail-in {{survey of}} 420 Canadians by Carleton University Survey Centre and the Montreal-based Association for Canadian Studies found 30% {{agreed with the}} {{statement}} [...] "I know God really exists and I have no doubts", 20% acknowledged they [...] "have doubts" [...] but [...] "feel that I do believe in God", 10% answered <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> in God [...] "sometimes", 20% <b>said</b> <b>they</b> don't <b>believe</b> in a [...] "personal God" [...] but [...] "do believe in a higher power", 12% adopted the classic agnostic position and <b>said</b> <b>they</b> [...] "don't know whether there is a God and don't believe {{there is a way to}} find out", and 7% said no god exists.

This {{suggested}} to police she'd left the area in another car. [...] At 5:00 pm, Murray's boyfriend and his parents arrived in Haverhill. He was interrogated in private, and then was joined by his parents for questioning. At 7:00 pm, the police <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> Murray came to the area to either run away or commit suicide; her family believed this was unlikely.|$|E

The Republican ad was denounced by the editorial boards of the Washington Post {{and a number of}} Virginia newspapers as a [...] "smear" [...] and [...] "dishonest." [...] Kaine responded with an ad [...] "in which he told voters that he opposes capital punishment but would take an oath and enforce the death penalty. In later polls, voters <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> Kaine's response and were angered by Kilgore's negative ads." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} filmed on the Universal Studios back lot in Los Angeles.

The front of Melinda and Jim's house is also the same set used by the Finch family in the film adaptation of To Kill A Mockingbird. Cast and crew members <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that the set got visits from real spirits.
