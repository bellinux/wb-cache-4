25|$|After beating Mars Bar in a foot {{race and}} goading him into {{crashing}} Piper's birthday {{party at the}} McNabs' house, Jeffrey is homeless again. He moves back into the buffalo pen, and runs for miles every morning before Two Mills wakes up. Before long, Mars Bar starts running with him as if by coincidence, and they never <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> each other. One day they come across a hysterical Piper McNab, who frantically leads them to Russell, stuck on the trolley trestle where Jeffrey's parents died. He walks away silently, nearly unconscious and stunned by fear, while Mars Bar rescues Russell, becoming a hero in his eyes. Jeffrey retreats once again to the buffalo pen, where Mars Bar leads Amanda to it. She brings him to her house in a huff, with Jeffrey and Mars Bar following her.|$|E
2500|$|A more {{important}} pre-release viewing {{had to be}} held for Defense Minister Andrei Grechko and Yepishev. After the screening ended, the generals headed for the exit without saying a word. Ozerov asked for their opinion; Grechko answered, [...] "I will not <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> you!" [...] and left the room. The film had to be edited four times before it was authorized for public screening on 1969, together with the already finished second part, Breakthrough. The two had their world premiere in July 1969, during the VI Moscow Film Festival.|$|E
2500|$|The 1942 season {{opened with}} a game against a {{military}} team from the Great Lakes Naval Station that featured 13 All-Americans and several professional players. [...] Despite being rated as 35-point underdogs, the Wolverines held the Great Lakes team scoreless and won 9-0. [...] The 1942 season also featured the first match between Michigan and Notre Dame since 1909. [...] Ceithaml led Michigan to a 33-20 win over the Fighting Irish and scored the Wolverines' first touchdown on a quarterback sneak. [...] In a 1993 interview, Ceithaml recalled that the 1942 Notre Dame match was [...] "more than just a game." [...] He recalled: [...] "We were so revved, we could have played two more quarters. [...] The coaches never had to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> get us jacked up. [...] We're Michigan. [...] And the personal pride -- the pride of beating Notre Dame -- was intense." ...|$|E
60|$|Henry quietly {{left the}} room, without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> anybody.|$|R
6000|$|... "Father, why did {{you sell}} her without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> me about your intention? It was very, very, very unkind--indeed it was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't interrupt! I {{sent you}} to Fillmore, {{and he had}} no {{business}} to let you go without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> me. What happened?" ...|$|R
60|$|Danny didn't <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> Peter Rabbit, but gnawed {{faster than}} ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> {{him about}} it, Nan!" [...] he cried. [...] "Don't you go interceding {{with him for}} me. I've got some pride left. He can take the farm from me, and he can take you maybe, but he can't take my self-respect. I won't beg him for mercy. Don't you dare to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> him about it." ...|$|E
60|$|Little Dorrit and he {{went out}} {{together}} soon afterwards, and Mr Meagles lingered behind to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> his friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "'You know me,' he goes on. 'I ain't a quarrelsome sort of chap. If nobody <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> me, I never <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> anybody; and it's {{been like}} that ever since I left her, {{day in and day}} out, all just the same. Up in the morning, do your bit of work, drink your glass of beer, and to bed in the evening; nothing to excite you, nothing to rouse you. Why, it's a mere animal existence.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{left the}} table the instant the last answer was given, and hurried {{out of the}} room without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> any of us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Ledwich. She {{sent back}} {{three of the}} Cocksmoor {{children}} this morning. It seems she warned them last Sunday without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> us." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Count Pateroff, {{holding his}} watch in his hand, bolted {{out of the}} room before Harry could <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
60|$|So {{they all}} three went out together, {{and while they}} stood waiting for Lady Thurwell's victoria, he managed to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> her alone.|$|E
60|$|LADY MARY (hurriedly {{thinking}} things out). I know. I--I think, George, {{that before}} your mother comes I {{should like to}} <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> father.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did she {{show her}} duty when {{she allowed herself}} to be engaged to {{a man like that}} without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> any of her family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose we}} had better all go in together," [...] said Samway, gloomily. [...] "Perhaps I may have <b>a</b> chance of <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> master." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, and God bless you, my own darling!" [...] And then without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> any one else, {{he turned}} his back upon them and went his way.|$|R
6000|$|SERGEANT (not availing {{himself of}} the offer). One gentleman to another, sir. Wouldn't you like to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> your missis, sir, before you go? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is of no}} use, ma'am, Mr. Pettilove {{never will}} do nothing. Perhaps {{if you would be}} kind enough to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> him, ma'am--' ...|$|E
60|$|How you adore him, Anne! You may {{set your}} mind at rest. I'm {{not going to}} <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> Arthur. I'm going to speak to Violet.|$|E
6000|$|... "We have no {{intention}} of asking it of him, Grace. Rupert and I intend to be off next week, without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Hardinge on the subject." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, you've {{been sitting}} {{there for the}} last half-hour without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> me; and it is dull. Looking at a woman mending {{stockings}} is dull, ain't it, Charley?' ...|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} morning, early, he went across to Bolsover Terrace, {{to begin his}} task of reproving the Carroll family, without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> Dolly indicative of his purpose.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} and for the moment all three half {{understood}} one another. Yet none dared <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> ease the pent-up things that choked them.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not {{for great}} lords to avenge {{themselves}} upon the fallen. Yet my slave here was also wronged and would <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> yonder Houman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear mama,' rejoined Kate, 'don't <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> him, {{but let us}} {{run away}} {{as fast as we}} can, and shut {{ourselves}} up till Nicholas comes home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} know nothing about it?" [...] said Eames to his friend, having run upstairs {{for the purpose of}} <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> him while he washed his hands.|$|R
6000|$|He grasped now how profoundly {{the order}} of the {{universe}} had changed for him. He had come right away to this amazing experience, without even <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> his cousin Jane! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fanny! I'm {{not saying}} nothing against Fanny. Not {{but what she}} hadn't no {{business}} to let the girl into {{the house in the}} middle of the night without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't, don't, you dreadful child; I wish I {{had never}} spoken to you,' cried Gillian, {{overwhelmed}} with confusion. 'You must never <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> any living creature.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything’s {{beautiful}} and quiet," [...] said Mr. Grummit, trembling with eagerness, [...] "and I wouldn’t <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> a soul. I’ll take my solemn davit I wouldn’t." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{that you}} depart, you may <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> whom you will," [...] she {{answered}} contemptuously. And, turning aside, she motioned Gonzaga to the crenel she abandoned.|$|E
60|$|Without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> Richard of his intentions, he {{therefore}} {{went to the}} squire's study, {{and told}} him what had taken place, as he had learned it from Richard. The squire listened silently.|$|R
6000|$|Eichel {{sinks into}} {{profound}} reflection; says nothing. How is this fire to be got under? Where {{is the place}} to trample on it, before opening door or window, or <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> the King or anybody? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{could you}} go away so long, without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> me or letting me hear of you or know {{anything}} about you?' asked the poor little woman, sobbing. 'How could you be so cruel, Quilp?' ...|$|R
