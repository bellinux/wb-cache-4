25|$|It {{was only}} when Poulidor was taken into the army for {{compulsory}} national service in 1955 that he first travelled in a train. Pierre Chany, a French reporter who followed 49 Tours de France, drew the comparison with Poulidor's eventual rival, Jacques Anquetil: by the time Poulidor first <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> train, Anquetil had already been to Helsinki, ridden the Olympic Games, won a medal for France, turned professional and won the Grand Prix des Nations. Yet there was {{less than two years}} between them.|$|E
25|$|In 1920 he was {{discharged}} from his duties at Walter Reed Hospital having reached {{the rank of}} captain. He returned to Long Hill, and with his money dwindling {{made the decision to}} return to the ring. After six months of preparation he faced 'Kid' Green on 28 December 1920. Despite the three and a half-year absence from the ring, Welsh was in good shape and took only four rounds to beat Green; though he had switched his trademark defensive boxing to a heavier brawling style. Welsh then fought twice in May 1921, against Willie Jackson and Kid Murphy, both wins; but the most notable event regarding the bouts was the appearance of heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, who was spending time relaxing at Welsh's health farm. After two more fights in 1921, both in Canada, Welsh returned to New York to face Archie Walker in April 1922. The fight was a sporting disaster for Welsh, losing seven of the ten rounds, and by the tenth he was being chased around the ring as he covered himself up. It was a pitiful display and Welsh never <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> professional ring again.|$|E

2500|$|Orwell {{set out for}} Spain {{on about}} 23 December 1936, dining with Henry Miller in Paris on the way. The American writer told Orwell that going {{to fight in the}} Civil War out of some sense of {{obligation}} or guilt was 'sheer stupidity,' and that the Englishman's ideas 'about combating Fascism, defending democracy, etc., etc., were all baloney.' A few days later, in Barcelona, Orwell met John McNair of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) Office who quoted him: [...] "I've come to fight against Fascism". Orwell <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> complex political situation in Catalonia. The Republican government was supported by a number of factions with conflicting aims, including the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM– Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista), the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (a wing of the Spanish Communist Party, which was backed by Soviet arms and aid). The ILP was linked to the POUM so Orwell joined the POUM.|$|E
2500|$|Many Moscow theatre goers {{remember}} the Theatre {{as it was}} after the reconstruction of 1938 and a series of cosmetic repairs: a large multi-storey building, its facade decorated with Italian arches, a cosy auditorium of comfortable proportions and the amazing blue foyer with white columns. It was there that the famous opera directors Leonid Baratov and Lev Mikhailov created their productions, the great Vladimir Bourmeister and his gifted follower Alexey Chichinadze staged their ballets, the wonderful stage [...] designers such as Boris Volkov and Alexander Lushin devised their unforgettable sets and the outstanding conductors Samuel Samosud, Dmitry Kitaenko and Vladimir Kozhukhar lead the orchestra. More than one generation of remarkable singers and dancers has starred there. After Dmitry Bryantsev took the lead of the Ballet Company in 1985 and Alexander Titel became the Artistic Director of the Opera Company in 1991, the theatre <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> new era, staying true to the great traditions of the founding fathers.

Cameron settled in D'Escousse after buying a house he describes as [...] "composed of two tiny ancient buildings pushed together to make one comfortable home."

[...] A hunting party led by Thomas Spencer was attacked at Drake's Creek in 1784. [...] Spencer survived, but was later killed in an ambush near Crab Orchard. [...] In 1786, Anthony Bledsoe wrote a letter to North Carolina governor Richard Caswell reporting that 14 settlers had been killed that year and sought permission to attack the Chickamaugas. [...] A schoolmaster named George Hamilton was shot and badly wounded at Bledsoe's Station in 1787. [...] As attacks increased, Anthony Bledsoe moved his family from Greenfield to Bledsoe's Station, which afforded better protection, but in 1788 he was shot and mortally wounded when he accidentally <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> section of the fort vulnerable to hostile fire.
