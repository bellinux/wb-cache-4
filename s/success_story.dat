Methods: Although <b>success</b> <b>stories</b> have not been widely used in public health, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services developed a series of stories, the Community Change Chronicles, to highlight environmental and policy changes that promote cardiovascular health. In 2003, the Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN) program used the Community Change Chronicles as a model to develop <b>success</b> <b>stories</b> about WISEWOMAN projects.

5|$|An early <b>success</b> <b>story</b> in the 1950s was {{the saving}} of the nene (or Hawaiian goose) from extinction. Birds {{were brought to}} the site and {{breeding}} at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was not protected from the predators that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.|$|E

5|$|Gilroy {{spent several}} years trying to write a plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements. Eventually, he decided to instead start by {{designing}} the characters, and attempted to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt antiheros were a rarity in films, because they are difficult to write, and usually devolve into psychopaths; {{in an attempt to}} break from the stereotype, he thought of writing an antihero <b>success</b> <b>story.</b> Several films, including The King of Comedy (1983), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), were used as research on how to write antiheroes.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{some other}} rebels in the leadership, Rau kept {{most of his}} positions. He {{remained}} {{a member of the}} Politburo and deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers. In the Politburo he continued to be responsible for the industry of the GDR. However, his position had been weakened. Bruno Leuschner, a follower of Ulbricht and Rau's successor as chairman of the National Planning Commission, now became a new candidate member of the Politburo. During the ensuing period, Leuschner, often supported by Ulbricht, gradually superseded Rau as the senior leader for the economy as a whole. The official GDR press never mentioned the dissension between Rau and Leuschner and always described their cooperation as a <b>success</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E

As rhetorical devices, <b>success</b> <b>stories</b> {{play an important role in}} activist groups' attempts to frame citizenship and bureaucratic accountability but also have a role in promoting movement cohesion and continuity. <b>Success</b> <b>stories</b> presented at conferences by authentic grassroots activists help to show influential movement sympathisers and policy-makers that the movement is socially diverse and that ordinary people are participating. The conscious use of rhetoric is part of building a sense of belonging to particular groups or to the wider movement. An ethnographic focus on the production, reproduction and performance of <b>success</b> <b>stories</b> reveals the extent to which concern over representation is central to activist practice and identity...|$|R
