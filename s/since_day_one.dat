500|$|One of Jolie's {{requests}} was {{to rework}} the third act, which originally had Salt rescue {{his wife and son}} from a coalition of villains, because she did not believe a mother would neglect her child in this kind of situation. Wimmer decided to then make Salt more crucial to the villain's schemes, and add a sequence where Salt breaks into [...] "a place harder than Fort Knox" [...] – after considering Camp David, Wimmer settled on the White House. When asked if the script written for Cruise was the same for Jolie, he said [...] "I think that it’s just been a continual process, obviously accelerating by changing the central character. But the ideas – the locomotive of ideas that drive the film are the same. An undercover CIA operative is accused of being a Russian mole, and has to go on the run to defend himself.

500|$|Development of Baldur's Gate II {{began in}} January 1999. From the {{suggestions}} of fans on message boards and newsgroups, reviews of Baldur's Gate, and internal suggestions, {{a list of}} constructive criticism was compiled; from this list, a slightly shorter one of features {{to be added to}} the game was made. Some of the items on this list were: support for higher resolutions, such as 800 by 600 pixels and above; 3D support; non-pausing dialogue in multiplayer; drop off panels in the interface; character kits; dual-wielding of weapons; a streamlined journal and annotable map; deathmatch; and inclusion of famous AD monsters such as the dragon. Not many features had to be cut, and they kept as many as they could. Because of the engine's mature state of development, most features were fairly easy to add. Ben Smedstad, the producer of the game, said, [...] "The engine was up and running <b>since</b> <b>day</b> <b>one,</b> which is a huge morale booster. When a monster is complete, we put it into the 'override' directory and it appears in the game! This is a huge change from working on the original."

2500|$|Experts {{attribute}} high {{mortality rates}} and under nutrition amongst infants to the decreasing number {{of woman who}} breastfeed.

2500|$|Despite lasting in {{the serial}} for eight years, {{during his tenure}} in EastEnders, {{producers}} appeared to differ in their opinions of Pete's importance in the programme; some referenced the character's value, while others deemed him disposable and there were several attempts to cull the character. It was revealed in 1987 that Pete was originally only {{intended to be a}} short-term character. Show creator and series producer Julia Smith had considered killing him off in 1986, but she vetoed this idea, ultimately deciding that Pete was too much of an asset to lose. When producer Mike Gibbon took the helm as head of the serial in 1989, he employed writer David Yallop to pen storylines that controversially killed-off various characters in the show. According to Yallop, the decision to axe the characters was dependent of the talent of the actors portraying them. Yallop stated that Pete Beale was among the characters to be killed. The storyline never came to fruition because Gibbon's controversial plots were not sanctioned by the BBC and Yallop's storylines were not used; Yallop sued the BBC for termination of contract, at which time the finer details of the proposed plots were disclosed to the media. Despite this, in 1991, EastEnders storyline editor Andrew Holden described Pete as [...] "almost synonymous" [...] with the programme because he had been there <b>since</b> <b>day</b> <b>one.</b> He added, [...] " [...] carry a lot of history. Original characters are very precious things. [...] has always seen himself as a family man and in the future we see him making a determined effort to put his family back together.
