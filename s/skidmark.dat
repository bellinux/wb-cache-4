50|$|Super <b>Skidmarks</b> is {{a racing}} video game {{developed}} by Acid Software and released in 1995. The game is {{the sequel to}} <b>Skidmarks</b> and as such was also termed <b>Skidmarks</b> 2 and Super <b>Skidmarks</b> 2 by commentators. The game features “minimally realistic” action viewed from an isometric perspective as well as novelty vehicles such as wheeled cows and caravans. Various methods such as joypad adapters and link systems are employed to allow multiple players to compete, up {{to a maximum of}} 8. The game was critically acclaimed and a best-seller in the UK. Several upgrades to the Amiga original were released as well as conversions for the Amiga CD32 and Sega Mega Drive, the latter published by Codemasters.|$|R

50|$|Super <b>Skidmarks</b> was {{developed}} by New Zealand-based Acid Software, predominantly designed and written by Chris Blackbourn. The game is the sequel to <b>Skidmarks</b> and was originally intended as an expanded version containing new tracks and a track editor before being developed into a full sequel (though the final game featured no track editor). The first game suffered problems with disk accessing and crashes which were fixed for Super <b>Skidmarks,</b> partly through the ability to install the game on a hard drive. The game includes {{twice the number of}} tracks as in the original as well as an increased number of vehicles and competitions and a more difficult single-player mode. The artificial intelligence was made to be more intelligent and realistic. <b>Skidmarks</b> has a two-player split screen mode while the sequel allows a three-way split screen or four players to play using a whole screen in a mode inspired by Micro Machines. Players can use multiple joysticks rather than share a keyboard. Another additional feature is the ability to attach a caravan to the player's vehicle, dramatically affecting the handling. A Mega Drive conversion was published by Codemasters.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{run-time}} system for strongly-typed programming languages that supports object sharing in a distributed system. The key insight in this system is that type information allows efficient and transparent sharing of data with both fine-grained and coarse-grained access patterns. In contrast, conventional distributed shared memory (DSM) systems that support sharing of an untyped memory region are limited to providing only one granularity with good performance. This new run-time system, <b>SkidMarks,</b> provides a shared object space abstraction rather than a shared address space abstraction. Three key aspects of the design are: First, <b>SkidMarks</b> uses type information, in particular, the ability to unambiguously recognize references, to make fine-grained sharing efficient by supporting object granularity coherence. Second, <b>SkidMarks</b> aggregates the communication of objects, making coarse-grained sharing efficient. Third, <b>SkidMarks</b> uses a globally unique "handle'' rather than a virtual address to name an object, enabling each machine to allocate storage just for the objects that it accesses, improving spatial locality. We compare <b>SkidMarks</b> to TreadMarks, a conventional DSM system that is efficient at handling coarse-grained sharing. Our performance evaluation substantiates the following claims: The performance of coarse-grained applications is nearly as good as in TreadMarks (within 6 %). Since the performance of such applications is already good in TreadMarks, we consider this an acceptable performance penalty. The performance of fine-grained applications is considerably (up to 98 % for Barnes-Hut and 62 % for Water-Spatial) better than in TreadMarks. The performance of garbage-collected applications is considerably (up to 150 %) better than in TreadMarks...|$|R

5000|$|Another burnout {{technique}} {{is aimed at}} cars with insufficient power to perform a burnout from a standing-still position. It involves putting the car into reverse, reversing at a higher speed than normal and then quickly putting the car into first gear and hitting the accelerator. A variant {{of this is to}} reverse at an angle which will result in two (for cars with limited slip differentials) distinctive <b>skidmarks</b> once the car pushes forward — in Arab parts of the world, this trick is called the [...] "88", as the <b>skidmarks</b> resemble two number-eights in Arabic ("٨٨"). In the United States these marks are referred to as [...] "fishhooks", a very accurate description of the <b>skidmarks</b> as the car will leave a longer mark when the vehicle's velocity becomes aligned with its forward direction. During this stunt the vehicle always experiences a (not necessarily constant) acceleration vector pointing along the car's forward direction, but the velocity vector will reverse direction from initially pointing backwards to forward, leaving the [...] "hook" [...] mark.|$|R

Amiga Format called the game “nigh on perfect” and “a completely social sport” which “couldn’t be realised through any medium other than a computer”.

40|$|On roads showing {{significant}} {{violations of}} posted speed limits, {{one measure of}} the safety effect of speeding {{is the difference between}} the road's actual accident count and the count that would have occurred if the posted speed limit had been strictly obeyed. An estimate of this accident reduction can be had by computing the probability that speeding was a necessary condition for each of set of accidents. This is an instance of assessing individual probabilities of causation, which is generally not possible absent prior knowledge of causal structure. For traffic accidents such prior knowledge is often available and this paper illustrates how, for a commonly occurring class of vehicle/pedestrian accidents, approaches to uncertainty and causal analyses appearing in the accident reconstruction literature can be unified using Bayesian networks. Measured <b>skidmarks,</b> pedestrian throw distances, and pedestrian injury severity are treated as evidence, and using the Gibbs Sampling routine BUGS, the posterior probability distribution over exogenous variables, such as the vehicle's initial speed, location, and driver reaction time, is computed. This posterior distribution is then used to compute the "probability of necessity" for speeding.

500|$|Quinn {{is portrayed}} by actress Dianna Agron. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought out actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway looking for unknown actors. Agron was the last primary actor to be cast, having won the role only days before the pilot began filming. Agron auditioned for Glee coming from a background in dancing and acting. She has been taking dance classes {{since the age of}} three, appeared in many music theatre productions and has appeared in television roles for <b>Skidmarks,</b> , and Heroes. Agron said in a 2009 interview pertaining to her casting session: [...] "I nearly bailed on my audition for the show. I was so nervous". With her wholesome good looks, Agron certainly looked the part, but the producers wondered if she appeared too innocent. Agron said in an interview: [...] "They told me to come back with straight hair and to dress sexier. Later that week, I started work." [...] Agron auditioned with Frank Sinatra's [...] "Fly Me to the Moon". The Glee producers said [...] "we really lucked out in finding Agron to play Quinn".|$|R
