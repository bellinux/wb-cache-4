40|$|Abstract Background Gastrointestinal {{nematodes}} {{constitute a}} major cause of morbidity and mortality in grazing ruminants. Individual animals or breeds, however, are known to differ in their resistance to infection. Gene expression profiling allows us to examine large numbers of transcripts simultaneously in order to identify those transcripts that contribute to an animal's susceptibility or resistance. Results With the goal of identifying genes with a differential pattern of expression between sheep genetically resistant and susceptible to gastrointestinal nematodes, a 20, 000 spot ovine cDNA microarray was constructed. This array was used to interrogate the expression of 9, 238 known genes in duodenum tissue of four resistant and four susceptible female lambs. Naïve animals were used in order to look at genes that were differentially expressed in the absence of infection with gastrointestinal nematodes. Forty one unique known genes were identified that were differentially expressed between the resistant and <b>susceptible</b> <b>animals.</b> Northern blotting of a selection of the genes confirmed differential expression. The differentially expressed genes had a variety of functions, although many genes relating to the stress response and response to stimulus were more highly expressed in the <b>susceptible</b> <b>animals.</b> Conclusion We have constructed the first reported ovine microarray and used this array to examine gene expression in lambs genetically resistant and susceptible to gastrointestinal nematode infection. This study indicates that <b>susceptible</b> <b>animals</b> appear to be generating a hyper-sensitive immune response to non-nematode challenges. The gastrointestinal tract of <b>susceptible</b> <b>animals</b> is therefore under stress and compromised {{even in the absence of}} gastrointestinal nematodes. These factors may contribute to the genetic susceptibility of these animals. </p...|$|R
40|$|Caspi, Immune mechanims in uveitis p. 2 EAU as a {{model of}} human uveitis Experimental {{autoimmune}} uveoretinitis (EAU) is an animal model of posterior uveitic diseases in the human. EAU can be induced in <b>susceptible</b> <b>animal</b> species by immunization with retinal antigens or their fragments, and in mice and rats also by infusion of T cells specific to these antigens, that are isolated from immunized animals and cultured for various periods of time in the laboratory. <b>Susceptible</b> <b>animal</b> species include rodents as well as primates, which makes this model useful not only for basic studies of immune mechanisms but also for preclinical testing of therapeutic modalities [1 - 3]. A number of antigens that induce uveoretinitis in laboratory animals have been identified over the years, using as starting material bovine retinal extracts. Subsequently, the genes for these antigens were cloned from a variety of animal species and characterized. Typically, uveitogenic antigens tend to represent evolutionarily conserved proteins involved {{in one way or another}} in visual functioning. They include the retinal soluble antigen (S-Ag) : a 48 kilodalton intracellular protein that participates in phototransduction; the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding bindin...|$|E
40|$|Leptospirosis is a {{widespread}} zoonosis characterized by multiple organ failure and variable host susceptibility toward pathogenic Leptospira strains. In this study, we put the role of inflammatory mediators in parallel with bacterial burdens and organ lesions by comparing a <b>susceptible</b> <b>animal</b> model, the hamster, and a resistant one, the Oncins France 1 (OF 1) mouse, both infected with virulent Leptospira interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae strain Verdun. Histological observations evidenced edema, congestion, hemorrhage, and inflammatory infiltration in the organs of hamsters, in contrast to limited changes in mice. Using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR techniques, we showed that the relative Leptospira burden progressively increased in hamster tissues, while a rapid clearance was observed in mouse tissues. The early regulation of the proinflammatory mediators interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), IL- 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and cyclo-oxygenase- 2 and the chemokines gamma interferon-inducible protein 10 kDa/CXCL 10 and macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 α/CCL 3 in mouse tissues contrasted with their delayed and massive overexpression in hamster tissues. Conversely, the induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 was faster in the resistant than in the <b>susceptible</b> <b>animal</b> model.

40|$|A chronic stress {{paradigm}} comprising {{exposure to}} predation, tail suspension and restraint induces a depressive syndrome in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice {{that occurs in}} some, but not all, animals. Here, we sought to extend our behavioural studies to investigate how susceptibility (sucrose preference 65 %) to stress-induced anhedonia affects the 5 HT system and the expression of inflammation-related genes. All chronically stressed animals, displayed increased level of anxiety, but susceptible mice exhibited an increased propensity to float in the forced swim test and demonstrate hyperactivity under stressful lighting conditions. These changes were not present in resilient or acutely stressed animals. Compared to resilient <b>animals,</b> <b>susceptible</b> mice showed elevated expression of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and the 5 -HT transporter (SERT) in the pre-frontal area. Enhanced expression of 5 HT 2 A and COX- 1 in the pre-frontal area was observed in all stressed animals.

40|$|Trabalho Final de Mestrado Integrado, Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Farmácia, 2014 Background: Escherichia coli (E. coli) K 1 is {{responsible}} for about 85 % of cases of E. coli neonatal bacterial sepsis and meningitis. E. coli K 1 strains are vertically transmitted from mother to child during birth. E. coli O 18 :K 1 A 192 PP, the strain used in this study, demonstrated to have age dependent disease severity and to be fatal when administrated to 2 -day-old animals. The knowledge of the E. coli K 1 distribution trends numbers along the {{different regions of the}} small intestine in <b>susceptible</b> and resistant <b>animals</b> can be used in the development of new therapeutic strategies Methods: In this work, 2 (P 2) (susceptible) and 9 -day-old (P 9) (resistant) pathogen-free Wistar rats were used to investigate the intestinal colonization of E. coli K 1 in vivo. Tissues from proximal, middle and distal regions were collected from the 24 hr and 48 hr post infection from both <b>susceptible</b> and resistant <b>animals.</b> In an attempt to understand the pattern of colonization in <b>susceptible</b> and resistance <b>animals,</b> total DNA was extracted from the rat tissues and E. coli K 1 counts and total bacterial numbers were quantified using real time PCR. The viable E. coli K 1 counts were compared between 2 and 9 -day-old animals in the three different intestinal regions, using serial dilutions from homogenized tissues and subculturing for K 1. Results: The results from E. coli K 1 viability suggest that <b>susceptible</b> <b>animals</b> have higher numbers of CFU/g overall in all intestinal regions than resistant animals, particularly in the middle intestine. The data obtained from real time PCR supports the high colonization pattern observed in <b>susceptible</b> <b>animals</b> not only for total bacterial counts but also for E. coli K 1 numbers. Conclusion: This study has shown that <b>susceptible</b> <b>animals</b> have a decreased capability of keeping E. coli K 1 numbers under control in proximal and middle regions of the small intestine. The highly significant abundance of K 1 numbers in the middle small intestine of <b>susceptible</b> <b>animals</b> suggests this intestinal region is a probable area of translocation from gut to the bloodstream. Furthermore, it is predicted that E. coli K 1 translocation occurs from middle intestine approximately 24 hr post infection.

An illustration of the use of this model showed that, in some cases, variability effects due to stochastic factors were very important. In these particular conditions, the use of the deterministic model alone was not adequate for a good description of the infection. Consequently, improvements of the model were proposed {{in order to make it}} more realistic and to allow its use for the evaluation of the efficiency of field operations. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.
