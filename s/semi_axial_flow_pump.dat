40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the management of}} patients treated with mechanical circulatory support devices for short- or long-term use. Twenty-four patients suffering from postcardiotomy heart failure were treated with a minimally invasive <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump.</b> The device was effective in unloading the failing left ventricle and in maintaining an adequate systemic circulation. The principles of perioperative monitoring, and pharmacological therapy are outlined. The pump was also used {{as an alternative to}} the heart-lung machine in conjunction with coronary artery bypass surgery. Together with a short-acting β-blocker, esmolol, the heart was decompressed and heart motion was reduced, facilitating bypass surgery on the beating heart. The anesthesiological considerations using this method are described. An implantable left ventricular assist device was used as a bridge to heart transplantation in 10 patients. We were interested in assessing the possibility to establish such a treatment program at a non-transplanting center. A multidisciplinary approach was enabled thanks to the organization of our Heart Center and due the close collaboration with our transplant center at Lund University. As one of the first centers in Europe, we established a well-functioning program with good results. Nine out of 10 of the bridge patients, with treatment times varying between 53 to 873 days, survived pump treatment and were eventually transplanted. The device proved to be powerful enough to support the failing heart and enable rehabilitation of the patients. Outpatient management became simpler when using the electrical device with belt-worn batteries. The uncertain durability and the high risk of device-related complications are shortcomings that limit its potential for more permanent treatment of heart failure. A new generation of small implantable <b>axial</b> blood <b>flow</b> <b>pumps</b> has therefore been developed. The principles of these pumps are based on the first generation <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pumps</b> evaluated in this thesis. After several years of basic research and experimental studies, the first human implants have been performed. In the thesis, the hemodynamic effects of such a novel <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> have been evaluated in an acute heart failure model. This technology holds great promise, both as a bridge to heart transplantation, and as a permanent circulatory support system.

50|$|This concept utilises an <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> {{to force}} the water {{from one side of}} the ship to other rather than {{allowing}} it to slosh as in passive systems. Webster (1967) studied the design of such a tank in detail. The main disadvantage to this is that when the pump is operated there is a time lag for a sizeable amount of fluid to arrive at a tank, thus limiting instant roll stabilization. Hence, compared to fin stabiliser systems, this is highly inefficient.|$|R
