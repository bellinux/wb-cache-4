5|$|Known {{from several}} well-preserved skulls and {{abundant}} <b>skeletal</b> <b>material,</b> Majungasaurus has recently {{become one of}} the best-studied theropod dinosaurs from the Southern Hemisphere. It appears to be most closely related to abelisaurids from India rather than South America or continental Africa, a fact that has important biogeographical implications. Majungasaurus was the apex predator in its ecosystem, mainly preying on sauropods like Rapetosaurus, and {{is also one of the}} few dinosaurs for which there is direct evidence of cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|A {{little more}} than thirty years later, in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more <b>skeletal</b> <b>material</b> near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.|$|E
5|$|The false potto (Pseudopotto martini) is a lorisoid primate of {{uncertain}} taxonomic status {{found in}} Africa. Anthropologist Jeffrey H. Schwartz named it in 1996 {{as the only}} species of the genus Pseudopotto {{on the basis of}} two specimens (consisting only of <b>skeletal</b> <b>material)</b> that had previously been identified as pottos (Perodicticus potto). The precise provenances of the two specimens are uncertain, but at least one may have come from Cameroon. Schwartz thought the false potto could even represent a separate family, but other researchers have argued that the supposed distinguishing features of the animal do not actually distinguish it from the potto; specifically, the false potto shares several features with West African pottos.|$|E
40|$|DNA {{analysis}} from <b>skeletal</b> <b>materials</b> is significant supplement of the anthropological methods nowadays, especially in cases, where {{is not possible}} to obtain required information pursuant to anthropological characteristics of skeletal remains. Many studies dealing with DNA extraction from ancient and recent bones concurred in fact that the most difficult phase in DNA analysis of <b>skeletal</b> <b>materials</b> is its initial manipulation and selection of suitable procedure for DNA isolation. For this thesis, four different isolating techniques (phenol- chloroform extraction, procedure based on silica adsorption - QIAamp DNA Mini kit a DNA IQ System, extraction with Dextran Blue adsorption) were chosen and their parameters were optimized for maximal DNA yield. At comparing the quantification of selected isolating methods performed on recent <b>skeletal</b> <b>materials,</b> the phenol-chloroform extraction resulted as acceptable. This protocol enhanced by PTB (N-phenylacylthiazolum bromide) reagent was used on the skeletal set of eleven specimens from settlement Kněževes near Prague. Further, sex assessment was carried out by the part of amelogenin gene amplification and genetic profiles determined by STR (Short Tandem Repeat) analysis. Probable relationships were estimated on the basic of comparison of genetic profiles among [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Tomb B-4/7 {{contained}} {{the skeleton of}} an adult male with many offerings. The body was fully extended dorsally with the skull facing south-southwest. The person had a height of 170-171 cm, with the recovered <b>skeletal</b> <b>materials</b> consisting of a fragment of the skull, the mandible, long bones, five teeth, two vertebrae, five carpal bones, the patellas, and miscellaneous metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges.|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the fossils}} {{discovered}} in the Mussentuchit are scattered and disarticulated, with intact skeletons being relatively rare. Although the lakes did not actively destroy bones, it was not particularly conducive to good preservation either due to the long duration of the burial process. Before burial, scavengers could have disrupted the <b>skeletal</b> <b>material,</b> which {{is evident in the}} severed Eolambia tibiae bearing tooth marks {{discovered in the}} Cifelli #2 quarry. The regression of the lake could have occasionally created bogs, but they would not have been permanent enough to entrap and preserve larger vertebrates. Action by water currents seems to {{have played a role in}} the deposition of Eolambia bones in the Cifelli #2 quarry, where the bones are largely deposited at 28°, 69°, 93°, 131° and 161° azimuth (i.e. relative to north). These directions would have been parallel or sub-parallel to the edges of the lake, indicating orientation by lake currents, except for the 69° and 93° azimuths, which probably represent river currents.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} element {{for the formation}} of <b>skeletal</b> <b>material</b> in marine animals is calcium, but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below its compensation depth. Calcium carbonate also becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, and corals, because their ability to form shells will be reduced, and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. Affected planktonic organisms will include the snail-like molluscs known as pteropods, and single-celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. All of these are important parts of the food chain and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences. In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as it becomes more difficult to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{skeleton}} of Majungasaurus closely resembles those of Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus, {{the only other}} abelisaurid genera for which complete <b>skeletal</b> <b>material</b> is known. Majungasaurus was bipedal, with a long tail to balance out the head and torso, putting {{the center of gravity}} over the hips. Although the cervical (neck) vertebrae had numerous cavities and excavations (pleurocoels) to reduce their weight, they were robust, with exaggerated muscle attachment sites and ribs that interlocked for strength. Ossified tendons attached to the cervical ribs, giving them a forked appearance, as seen in Carnotaurus. All of these features resulted in a very strong and muscular neck. Uniquely, the cervical ribs of Majungasaurus had long depressions along the sides for weight reduction. The humerus (upper arm bone) was short and curved, closely resembling those of Aucasaurus and Carnotaurus. Also like related dinosaurs, Majungasaurus had very short forelimbs with four extremely reduced digits, first reported with only two very short external fingers and no claws. The hand and finger bones of Majungasaurus, like other majungasaurines, lacked the characteristic pits and grooves where claws and tendons would normally attach, and its finger bones were fused together, indicating that the hand was immobile. In 2012, a better specimen was described, showing that the lower arm was robust, though short, and that the hand contained four metatarsals and four, probably inflexible and very reduced, fingers, with small claws on the second and third finger. The phalanx formula was 1-2-2-1-0.|$|E
5|$|The short-finned {{pilot whale}} was described, from <b>skeletal</b> <b>materials</b> only, by John Edward Gray in 1846. He presumed from the {{skeleton}} that the whale had a large beak. The long-finned pilot whale was first classified by Thomas Stewart Traill in 1809 as Delphinus melas. Its scientific name was eventually changed to Globicephala melaena. Since 1986, the specific name of the long-finned pilot whale was changed to its original form melas. Other species classifications have been proposed but only two have been accepted. There exist geographic forms of {{short-finned pilot whale}}s off {{the east coast of}} Japan, which comprise genetically isolated stocks.|$|R

No explanation is given neither for the simultaneous occurrence of distinct polymorphs of Ca-carbonate within these liquid volumes, nor for the spatial {{arrangement of the}} mineral units which are always organized in species-specific structural sequences. Results {{of a series of}} physical characterizations applied to reference <b>skeletal</b> <b>materials</b> reveal the inadequacy of this liquid-filled chamber model to account for structural and chemical properties of the shell building units. Simultaneously, these data provide convergent pieces of evidence for a specific mode of crystallization developed throughout various invertebrate phyla, supporting the hypothesized “common strategy” based on a multi-scaled control exerted on formation of their calcareous hard parts...|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{previously}} published integrated studies, an attempt is made here to lay the foundations for a systematic approach to the examination of artifacts made from <b>skeletal</b> <b>materials.</b> Four principal groups of raw material are {{discussed in terms of}} formation, structure, morphology and availability : skeletal bone from species found within the geographical limits of the study; antlers from extant species of deer and from reindeer, which are no longer found within the regionivory from mammalian teeth, including the tusks of walrus, elephant and mammoth; keratinous hard tissues (which are not of skeletal derivation but which may usefully be considered in association with the other materials reviewed here). The mechanical properties of these materials are compared and contrasted, their fitness for particular roles being demonstrated scientifically : the reasons for the widespread preference of antler as a raw material are identified in this way and certain constructional features of composite objects explained. Working methods used in manufacture are discussed on the basis of close examination of the objects themselves, together with other evidence from archaeological sources and, to some extent, from records of practices noted more recently among related crafts. Chemical softening as a method of moulding and working <b>skeletal</b> <b>materials</b> is discussed and illustrated with the results of practical experiments carried out by the writer. A typological review of the artifacts follows, principally those found in the British Isles during the period c_. A. D, 400 - 1200; both geographical and chronological limits are freely crossed, however, in order to incorporate further evidence which may illuminate the material under review.

25|$|The revised 2016 dating of 50,000 {{years ago}} {{is close to the}} time that modern humans reached the area, {{suggesting}} that the initial encounter with H.sapiens caused or contributed to the demise of H.floresiensis.

The postcranial materials indicated a presence of an additional taxon, a very small artiodactyl, that has not been known from the dental materials of the Pondaung mammals. The differences in postcranial morphologies suggested a divers locomotory behavior among the mammals of the Pondaung fauna, such that scansors, generalized terrestrialists with cursorial tendency, and generalized terrestrialists with digging adaptations were present among the carnivorous mammals, and that small-sized and medium-sized ungulates distributed on various stages of cursorial adaptations...|$|R

500|$|In 1988, Zhao and American {{paleontologist}} Paul Sereno described P. xinjiangensis, {{named after}} the Xinjiang Autonomous Region {{in which it was}} discovered.

500|$|The type {{specimen}} is a partial skull, {{collected in the}} summer of 1884 from an outcrop of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation alongside the Red Deer River, in Alberta. This specimen, found on June 9, 1884, was recovered by an expedition of the Geological Survey of Canada, led by the famous geologist Joseph Burr Tyrrell. Due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured. In 1889, Tyrrell's colleague Thomas Chesmer Weston found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some <b>skeletal</b> <b>material</b> at a location nearby. The two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species Laelaps incrassatus by Edward Drinker Cope in 1892, although the name Laelaps was preoccupied by a genus of mite and had been changed to Dryptosaurus in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh. Cope refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival Marsh. However, Lawrence Lambe used the name Dryptosaurus incrassatus instead of Laelaps incrassatus when he described the remains in detail in 1903 and 1904, a combination first coined by Oliver Perry Hay in 1902. Shortly later, Osborn pointed out that D. incrassatus was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth, so the two Horseshoe Canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species. The Horseshoe Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of D. aquilunguis, type species of Dryptosaurus, so Osborn created the new name Albertosaurus sarcophagus for them in 1905. He did not describe the remains in any great detail, citing Lambe's complete description the year before. Both specimens (the holotype CMN 5600 and the paratype CMN 5601) are stored in the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa. By the early twenty-first century, some concerns had arisen that, due to the damaged state of the holotype, Albertosaurus might be a nomen dubium, a [...] "dubious name" [...] that could only be used for the {{type specimen}} itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it. However, in 2010, Thomas Carr established that the holotype, the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or autapomorphy: the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the palatine bone, proving that Albertosaurus was a valid taxon.|$|E

40|$|Taphonomic studies aid in {{understanding}} the transition of organic matter from living contexts (the biosphere) to geological contexts (the lithosphere), and how agents and processes affect skeletal remains in the archaeological record. Archaeological research in the Atuel River valley, Mendoza, Argentina, {{has been carried out}} for several years. However, actualistic approaches to examine local and regional taphonomic processes have only been recently developed in this area. Longitudinal studies of disarticulation and dispersion of bones from carcasses are presented here in order to understand how <b>skeletal</b> <b>materials</b> are naturally added to, subtracted from, and mixed within the archaeological record. In this paper we explore variability in the influence of taphonomic processes in different microhabitats of the valley and how these mechanisms impact the potential of mixing during bone deposition in the archaeological record.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{existence}} of <b>skeletal</b> <b>materials</b> and accompanying archaeological subsistence data recording {{the shift from}} nomadic animal husbandary to sedentary agriculture during the 10 th and 11 th centuries in the Carpathian Basin offers the opportunity to document shifts in the frequencies in various disease categories. On {{the basis of the}} data from the literature of the paleopathological cases, skeletal samples representing 714 tenth and 970 eleventh century individuals are grouped for indications of environmental stress: specific disease stress (porotic hyperostosis), infections, traumatic lesions, degenerative arthritis and genetic and/or environment indicators (developmental anomalies). The frequency of lesions in the samples should not be extrapolated to the larger population, but may only be used as an indicator of a trend in the appearance of the diseases. The results suggest some significant shifts for some disease and little change for other diseases during the transition from a nomadic to a more sedentary way of life.

2500|$|The first <b>skeletal</b> <b>material</b> {{referred}} to an original Aublysodon species was a partial skull unearthed in Jordan, Montana in 1966 and described by Ralph Molnar in 1977/1978. The skull, specimen LACM 28741 at forty-five centimetres {{the length of}} an average human arm, bore pointed teeth attached to a long narrow snout. First {{thought to be a}} juvenile Tyrannosaurus, then interpreted as a large dromaeosaurid, this [...] "Jordan theropod" [...] was given the name Aublysodon molnaris by Gregory S. Paul in 1988; in 1990 the name was by Paul emended to Aublysodon molnari, applying the correct genitive. It was made a separate genus Stygivenator by George Olshevsky in 1995, but was later, in 2004, reinterpreted to be a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex by Thomas Carr and Tom Williamson. Another partial skeleton from New Mexico, specimen OMNH 10131, was in 1990 considered to represent Aublysodon, but later research by Thomas Carr and Tom Williamson first referred it to Daspletosaurus and ultimately to Bistahieversor. In 1988 Paul also created another species when renaming Shanshanosaurus huoyanshanensis Dong 1977 into Aublysodon huoyanshanensis. It probably represents a Tarbosaurus specimen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} mixing and {{assimilation}} of immigrant and native populations {{is virtually impossible}} to elucidate with material culture, but the skeletal evidence may shed some light on it. The 7th/8th-century average stature of male individuals in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries dropped by 15mm (⅝ in) compared with the 5th/6th-century average. This development is most marked in Wessex where the average dropped by 24mm (1in). This drop is not easily explained by environmental changes; there is no evidence for a change in diet in the 7th/8th centuries, nor is there any evidence of a further influx of immigrants at this time. Given the lower average stature of Britons, the most likely explanation would be a gradual Saxonisation or Anglicisation of the material culture of native enclaves, an increasing assimilation of native [...] populations into Anglo-Saxon communities, and increasing intermarriage between immigrants and natives within Anglo-Saxon populations. <b>Skeletal</b> <b>material</b> from the Late Roman and Early Anglo-Saxon period from Hampshire was directly compared.

40|$|The Cambrian Pedroche Formation {{comprises}} a mixed siliciclastic–carbonate succession recording subtidal deposition on {{a marine}} platform. Carbonate carbon isotope chemostratigraphy confirms previous biostratigraphic assignment of the Pedroche Formation to the Atdabanian regional stage of Siberia, correlative to Cambrian Series 2. At the outcrop scale, thrombolitic facies comprise ~ 60 % of carbonate-normalized stratigraphy and coated-grains another ~ 10 %. Petrographic point counts reveal that skeletons contribute at most 20 % to thrombolitic inter-reef and reef-flank lithologies; on average, archaeocyath clasts make up 68 % of <b>skeletal</b> <b>materials.</b> In contrast, petrographic point counts show that skeletons comprise a negligible volume of biohermal and biostromal thrombolite, associated nodular carbonate facies, and ooid, oncoid and peloid grainstone facies.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Radiocarbon (14 C) dating {{provided}} New World archaeological {{research with}} the first continent-wide common chronometric scale that transcended the mostly relative site- and region-specific chronological sequences that had been assembled during the preceding century of fieldwork. 14 C data {{continue to play a}} critical role in establishing a chronometric framework for the 5 -century-long debate concerning the timing of the initial peopling of the New World.

The introduction of a third-generation measurement technology of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) beginning in the late 1970 s has provided a means of obtaining analyses on milligram and microgram amounts of carbon permitting more detailed critical approaches to increasing the accuracy of 14 C values on certain sample types—particularly human <b>skeletal</b> <b>materials.</b> It also provided a more effective means of allowing greater dating precision in situations where such data had an important bearing on the validity of inferences about the rates of cultural evolutionary change in New World societies...|$|R

Chitin is a neutral (l- 4) -linked polysaccharide and a natural mucopolysaccharide that consists of 2 -acetamide- 2 -deoxy- { 3 -D-glucopyranose residues (N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units). It was first described in 1811 by Brancon-not. Chitin is found widely in nature as the <b>skeletal</b> <b>materials</b> of crustaceans and insects, and as a component of the cell walls of bacteria and fungi. It is not soluble in water due to its rigid crystalline structure and intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds. Chitosan is a polymer of D-glucosamine that was discovered by Rouget in 1859. It makes up the cell wall of Mucor rouxii and is easily obtained by deacetyla-tion of chitin. Chitosan is readily souluble in water as a result of salt formation by the C- 2 amino group of its glucosamine residue with various acids. In rats and rabbits, chitin has been found to increase the tensile strength of sutured wound, which indicates that unmodified chitin can accelerate wound healing.
