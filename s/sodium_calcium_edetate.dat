50|$|Dimercaprol and {{dimercaptosuccinic acid}} are {{chelating}} agents that sequester the arsenic away from blood proteins {{and are used}} in treating acute arsenic poisoning. The most important side effect is hypertension. Dimercaprol is considerably more toxic than succimer.DMSA monoesters, e.g. MiADMSA, are promising antidotes for arsenic poisoning. <b>Calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>edetate</b> is also used.|$|R
50|$|Treatment {{for lead}} {{poisoning}} normally involves {{the administration of}} dimercaprol and succimer. Acute cases may {{require the use of}} disodium <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate,</b> the <b>calcium</b> chelate of the disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). It has a greater affinity for lead than calcium, with the result that lead chelate is formed by exchange and excreted in the urine, leaving behind harmless calcium.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> (sodium calcium EDTA), {{also known}} as edetate calcium {{disodium}} among other names, is a medication primarily used to treat lead poisoning. This includes short term and long term lead poisoning. For lead encephalopathy it is typically used together with dimercaprol. It {{does not appear to}} be useful for tetraethyllead toxicity. It is given by slow injection into a vein or into a muscle.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include pain {{at the site}} of injection. Other side effects may include kidney problems, diarrhea, fever, muscle pains, and low blood pressure.

It is a salt of edetate with two sodium and one calcium atoms. It works by binding a number of heavy metals which allows them to leave the body in the urine.|$|E
40|$|Manganese (Mn) is an {{essential}} element for metabolic pathways {{but it can be}} toxic when present in excessive amounts in the body. Hypermanganesemia along with dystonia, polycythemia, characteristic MRI brain findings in the basal ganglia, and chronic liver disease are the hallmarks of an inherited Mn transporter defect due to mutations in the SLC 30 A 10 gene. We are reporting three siblings who presented with features of dystonia, polycythemia, MRI brain showing basal ganglia hyperintensity on T 1 weighted images and chronic liver disease. Blood Mn levels were markedly elevated in the affected patients. Mutation analysis of DNA samples of the affected children confirmed a homozygous missense mutation in SLC 30 A 10. Chelation therapy with intravenous disodium <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> was started in two siblings and led to a marked decrease in whole blood Mn. Oral Penicillamine was later added to the therapy which further improved blood Mn levels. This is a rare disorder {{and is one of the}} potentially treatable inherited metal storage disorders. It can be fatal if left untreated. Penicillamine may be an effective alternative to disodium <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{project was}} aimed at {{evaluation}} of comparative therapeutic efficacy of two treatment regimes {{for the treatment of}} lead poisoning in sheep. For this purpose 20, two-months-old, lambs of Buchi breed were used as experimental animals. Five animals were kept as healthy control, whereas the remaining 15 animals were given oral aqueous solution of lead acetate daily. The dose was started from 5 mg/kg bodyweight and was increased gradually till it reached 100 mg/kg body weight by the end of 2 nd month when clinical toxicosis was observed. Clinical findings included diarrhea, hindquarter weakness and reduction of feed intake, accompanied by anemia and elevated blood lead levels up to 2. 72 ppm. The 15 toxicated animals were divided into three groups A, B and C comprising of 5 animals each. Disodium <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate,</b> which was used to treat animals of group A, resulted in 52. 7 % fall in blood lead level in 5 days. A combination of disodium <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> and thiamine hydrochloride was used to treat animals of group B, which showed 73. 8 % fall in blood lead levels. Group C served as untreated control. Thus, combination therapy appears to be more effective for treatment of lead toxicosis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Chelation {{therapy has}} been used as a means of {{reducing}} the body burden of lead for five decades. Intravenous <b>sodium</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> has been the preferred agent, but there is increasing evi-dence that dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is also a potent chelator of lead. Methods: Oral DMSA 30 mg/kg/day was admin-istered to adults with blood lead concentrations> 50 mg/dl. The impact of DMSA on urine lead excretion, on blood lead concentrations and on symptoms was observed. The incidence and severity of adverse effects was also recorded. Results: Thirty-five courses were given to 17 patients. DMSA significantly (P< 0. 0001) increased urine lead excretion and significantly (P< 0. 0001) reduced blood lead concentrations.

40|$|Although {{manganese}} is {{an essential}} trace metal, {{little is known about}} its transport and homeostatic regulation. Here we have identified a cohort of patients with a novel autosomal recessive manganese transporter defect caused by mutations in SLC 39 A 14. Excessive accumulation of manganese in these patients results in rapidly progressive childhood-onset parkinsonism–dystonia with distinctive brain magnetic resonance imaging appearances and neurodegenerative features on post-mortem examination. We show that mutations in SLC 39 A 14 impair manganese transport in vitro and lead to manganese dyshomeostasis and altered locomotor activity in zebrafish with CRISPR-induced slc 39 a 14 null mutations.

50|$|It is now {{becoming}} clear that ankyrin-B {{exists in a}} biomolecular complex with the sodium potassium ATPase, <b>sodium</b> <b>calcium</b> exchanger and inositol triphosphate receptor which is localized in T-tubules within discrete microdomains of cardiomyocytes that are distinct from dyads formed by dihydropyridine receptors complexed to ryanodine receptors. The human ankyrin-B arrhythmogenic mutation (Glu1425Gly) blocks the formation of this complex, which provides a mechanism behind cardiac arrhythmias in patients. Studies from other labs have {{shed light on the}} requirement of ankyrin-B in the targeting and post-translational stability of the <b>sodium</b> <b>calcium</b> exchanger in cardiomyocytes, which is clinically important because elevated expression of the <b>sodium</b> <b>calcium</b> exchanger is a factor related to arrhythmia and heart failure. Ankyrin-B forms a membrane complex with ATP-sensitive potassium channels, which is necessary for normal channel trafficking and targeting the channel to sarcolemmal membranes; this interaction is also important in the response of cardiomyocytes to cardiac ischemia and metabolic regulation.|$|R
