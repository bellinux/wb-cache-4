5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was filmed and {{released}} in 2000. Filmed inside a nightclub, the video begins with Durand entering the stage while <b>simultaneous</b> images of the band using instruments appear. Durand then {{stands in front of}} a microphone, preparing for an upcoming verse. Various shots of an audience, background dancers and singers, and trumpet performers are also shown. After the second chorus, the clip focuses on Durand, who is now mouthing some of the words of the song; the final chorus resumes the <b>simultaneous</b> images setup.|$|E
5|$|Associativity {{refers to}} the {{observation}} that when weak stimulation of a single pathway is insufficient for the induction of LTP, <b>simultaneous</b> strong stimulation of another pathway will induce LTP at both pathways.|$|E
5|$|Between 1873 and 1882 Steinitz {{played no}} tournaments {{and only one}} match (a 7–0 win against Blackburne in 1876). His other games during this period were in <b>simultaneous</b> and {{blindfold}} exhibitions, which contributed {{an important part of}} a professional chess-player's income in those days (for example in 1887 Blackburne was paid 9 guineas for two <b>simultaneous</b> exhibitions and a blindfold exhibition hosted by the Teesside Chess Association; this was equivalent to about £4,800 at 2007 values).|$|E
5|$|Combat Controllers (CCT) are ground combat forces {{specialized}} {{in a traditional}} pathfinder role while having a heavy emphasis on <b>simultaneous</b> air traffic control, fire support (via airstrikes, close air support and command, control, and communications in covert or austere environments.|$|E
5|$|In principle, the <b>simultaneous</b> {{occurrence}} of a Solar eclipse and a transit {{of a planet}} is possible. But these events are extremely rare because of their short durations. The next anticipated <b>simultaneous</b> {{occurrence of}} a Solar eclipse and a transit of Mercury will be on July 5, 6757, and a Solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is expected on April 5, 15232.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} verses of the Yogatattva Upanishad, the <b>simultaneous</b> {{importance}} of yoga and jnana (knowledge) are asserted, and declared to be mutually complimentary and necessary.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to play the game}} with just two players (one per team) by having each player move on two boards. Analogously to <b>simultaneous</b> chess, this way of playing the game is referred to as <b>simultaneous</b> bughouse. It can also be played with just one clock by playing the boards in a specific order (WhiteA, WhiteB, BlackB, BlackA) and pressing the clock after each move. This variation is suitable for play by mail.|$|E
5|$|<b>Simultaneous</b> {{multithreading}} (of which Intel's Hyper-Threading is {{the best}} known) was an early form of pseudo-multi-coreism. A processor capable of <b>simultaneous</b> multithreading includes multiple execution units in the same processing unit—that is it has a superscalar architecture—and can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from multiple threads. Temporal multithreading {{on the other hand}} includes a single execution unit in the same processing unit and can issue one instruction at a time from multiple threads.|$|E
5|$|Some teleost {{species are}} hermaphroditic, which {{can come in}} two forms: <b>simultaneous</b> and sequential. In the former, both {{spermatozoa}} and eggs {{are present in the}} gonads. <b>Simultaneous</b> hermaphroditism typically occurs in species that live in the ocean depths, where potential mates are sparsely dispersed. Self-fertilisation is rare and has only been recorded in two species, Kryptolebias marmoratus and Kryptolebias hermaphroditus. With sequential hermaphroditism, individuals may function as one sex early in their adult life and switch later in life. Species with this condition include parrotfish, wrasses, sea basses, flatheads, sea breams and lightfishes.|$|E
5|$|The AFM is a Pentecostal {{church and}} its liturgy {{reflects}} the ecstatic and experiential practices found in similar churches world-wide. Shouting, antiphonal singing, <b>simultaneous</b> and spontaneous prayer and dance are still {{commonly found in}} the worship services.|$|E
5|$|The Gun Court Act and the Suppression of Crime Act {{were passed}} in special <b>simultaneous</b> {{sessions}} of the Senate and House of Representatives, and immediately {{signed into law}} by Governor-General Florizel Glasspole on 1 April 1974.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} is obliged to communicate in the official languages, and in the federal parliament <b>simultaneous</b> translation is provided from and into German, French and Italian.|$|E

5|$|The {{most recent}} Union-wide {{elections}} to the European Parliament were the European elections of 2014, held from 22 to 25 May 2014. They were the largest <b>simultaneous</b> transnational elections ever held {{anywhere in the}} world.|$|E
5|$|The {{technology}} company Akamai reported that 5,401,250web users logged on news sites {{in less than}} one minute, the fifth highest peak among news websites since the company started tracking data in 2005. During at-peak usage, news websites served seven million <b>simultaneous</b> video streams, which was {{the highest number of}} <b>simultaneous</b> video streams in Akamai's history. The Obama inaugural ceremony not only achieved the highest Internet viewership for a U.S.presidential inauguration, the inaugural event was the first to feature a live audio description of a swearing-in ceremony and the first to include closed captioning in the live webcast of the event.|$|E
5|$|Total {{albinism}} — a <b>simultaneous</b> complete {{absence of}} melanin from the eyes, skin, and feathers. This is the rarest form. Only 7% of 1,847 cases of avian albinism examined was this type.|$|E
5|$|Unrelated to Alex, Hurricane Pali {{developed}} over the Central Pacific in early January, and persisted through the formation of Alex. This marked the first known occurrence of <b>simultaneous</b> January tropical cyclones between the two basins.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of quantum {{mechanics}} is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which forbids the <b>simultaneous</b> measurement of the position and momentum of a particle along the same direction. Remarkably, the uncertainty principle for charged, material particles requires the quantization of light into photons, and even the frequency dependence of the photon's energy and momentum.|$|E
5|$|About 130 {{volcanic}} vents {{belong to}} {{the field and the}} earliest eruptions occurred 1.5 million years ago. Postglacial volcanic activity has included eruptions with <b>simultaneous</b> explosive and effusive components, and volcanic rocks in the field vary from basalt over andesite and dacite to rhyolite. The field was a source of obsidian with regional importance.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{calls and}} songs, which are {{produced}} in the syrinx, are the major means by which birds communicate with sound. This communication can be very complex; some species can operate {{the two sides of}} the syrinx independently, allowing the <b>simultaneous</b> production of two different songs.|$|E
5|$|Book {{embedding}} {{has also}} been frequently applied in the visualization of network data. Two of the standard layouts in graph drawing, arc diagrams and circular layouts, {{can be viewed as}} book embeddings, and book embedding {{has also been}} applied in the construction of clustered layouts, <b>simultaneous</b> embeddings, and three-dimensional graph drawings.|$|E
5|$|Flotilla is a {{three-dimensional}} <b>simultaneous</b> turn-based strategy space combat video game {{set in a}} randomly generated galaxy. The player and computer-controlled opponents issue orders to their ships, which are carried in a <b>simultaneous</b> and real-time fashion {{over a period of}} 30 seconds. The game then freezes, and the player and opponents issue new orders to their ships, which are again performed for 30 seconds. This process repeats until one party is defeated. Orders are separated into three groups: attack move, flank move and focus fire. An attack move orders the ships to move and fire simultaneously; a flank move increases the ship's speed but deactivates weapons until the ship stops moving; and focus fire increases fire rate but significantly reduces the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|Fringe premiered in Canada on CTV <b>simultaneous</b> to its U.S. premiere and was {{the most}} watched program in Canada that week. The show would {{fluctuate}} between airing on CTV and A during its first two seasons. Beginning with the third season, Fringe was broadcast on City in Canada.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} table, the years {{correspond to the}} year of the award ceremonies; the books were released in the preceding years. Entries with a lavender background have won the relevant award; those with a white background are the finalist nominees. Superscript letters after the result indicate <b>simultaneous</b> nominations in other categories.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} how the ARBiH and the HVO coordinated before their advance to Kupres. Most probably, the two forces' {{commands}} agreed on a <b>simultaneous</b> offensive against Kupres, without revealing actual battle plans to their counterparts. The HVO's contribution in the offensive, codenamed Operation Cincar, was planned jointly by the HVO and the HV.|$|E
5|$|More {{than one}} {{waterspout}} {{can occur in}} the same vicinity at the same time. As many as nine <b>simultaneous</b> waterspouts have been reported on Lake Michigan. The illustration on the left, by James Pollard Espy in 1841, shows {{the manner in which}} one spout, while forming, tends to generate others in its neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September 2017, Cunard {{announced}} a new addition to the fleet, expected to arrive in 2022. She {{will be the first}} new Cunard ship to enter service in 7 years, making it the first time since 1998 that Cunard will have four ships in <b>simultaneous</b> service.|$|E
5|$|<b>Simultaneous</b> to Midway's {{expansion}}, ATA Airlines began {{rapid expansion}} at Midway {{in the early}} 2000s (decade), and was the airport's dominant carrier prior to 2004, using 14 of the 17 gates in Concourse A. However, after the airline declared bankruptcy in October 2004, scheduled service from Midway significantly decreased.|$|E
5|$|The Confederates then {{attempted}} several <b>simultaneous</b> attacks, {{in particular}} {{by trying to}} persuade the Banu Qurayza to attack the Muslims from the south. From the Confederates, Huyayy ibn Akhtab, a Khaybarian, {{the leader of the}} exiled tribe Banu Nadir, returned to Medina seeking their support against the Muslims.|$|E
5|$|The <b>simultaneous</b> {{occurrence}} of a transit of Mercury and a transit of Venus does occur, but extremely infrequently. Such an event last occurred on 22 September 373,173 BC and will next occur on 26 July 69,163, {{and again on}} 29 March 224,508. The <b>simultaneous</b> {{occurrence of}} a solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is currently possible, but very rare. The next solar eclipse occurring during a transit of Venus will be on 5 April 15,232. The last time a solar eclipse occurred during a transit of Venus was on 1 November 15,607 BC. The day after the Venerean transit of 3 June 1769 there was a total solar eclipse, which was visible in Northern America, Europe and Northern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Within the {{red blood}} cells, the parasites {{multiply}} further, again asexually, periodically {{breaking out of}} their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from <b>simultaneous</b> waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|In game theory, a <b>simultaneous</b> {{game is a}} {{game where}} each player chooses his action without {{knowledge}} of the actions chosen by other players. <b>Simultaneous</b> games contrast with sequential games, which are played by the players taking turns (moves alternate between players). Normal form representations are usually used for <b>simultaneous</b> games.|$|E
25|$|Length contraction, like time dilation, is {{a manifestation}} of the {{relativity}} of simultaneity. Measurement of length requires measurement of the spacetime interval between two events that are <b>simultaneous</b> in one's frame of reference. But events that are <b>simultaneous</b> in one frame of reference are, in general, not <b>simultaneous</b> in other frames of reference.|$|E
25|$|Relativity of simultaneity: Two events, <b>simultaneous</b> for one {{observer}}, {{may not be}} <b>simultaneous</b> {{for another}} observer if the observers are in relative motion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Simultaneous</b> trilingualism is also possible. There is {{significantly}} less {{research in this}} area than in <b>simultaneous</b> bilingualism. However, trilingual language acquisition in young children has been shown to generally mirror bilingual acquisition.|$|E
