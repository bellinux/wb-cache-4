5|$|To {{better control}} the {{population}} of termites, various methods {{have been developed to}} track termite movements. One early method involved distributing termite bait laced with immunoglobulin G (IgG) marker proteins from rabbits or chickens. Termites collected from the field could be tested for the rabbit-IgG markers using a rabbit-IgG-specific assay. More recently developed, less expensive alternatives include tracking the termites using egg white, cow milk, or <b>soy</b> <b>milk</b> proteins, which can be sprayed on termites in the field. Termites bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein-specific ELISA test.|$|E
5|$|Fortune {{was born}} in Llandudno, North Wales, to a wealthy upper middle-class English family, {{although}} little is known of her early life. By her teenage years {{she was living in}} England's West Country, where she wrote two books of poetry. After time spent at a horticultural college she began studying psychology and psychoanalysis at the University of London before working as a counsellor in a psychotherapy clinic. During the First World War she joined the Women's Land Army and established a company selling <b>soy</b> <b>milk</b> products. She became interested in esotericism through the teachings of the Theosophical Society, before joining an occult lodge led by Theodore Moriarty and then the Alpha et Omega occult organisation.|$|E

She was {{initially}} stationed {{on a farm}} near to Bishop's Stortford on the borders between Essex and Hertfordshire, before later being relocated to an experimental base for the Food Production Department. There she carried out experiments {{in the production of}} <b>soy</b> <b>milk,</b> subsequently founding the Letchworth-based Garden City Pure Food Company to sell her products and publishing The Soya Bean: An Appeal to Humanitarians in 1925. It was while working at the base that she underwent a spiritual experience and subsequently further immersed herself in theosophical literature. After doing so, she became preoccupied by the idea of the 'Ascended Masters' or 'Secret Chiefs', claiming to have had visions of two such entities, the Master Jesus and the Master Rakoczi.|$|E

She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another.

They are consumed most often {{in the form of}} <b>soy</b> <b>milk</b> and tofu (bean curd), which is <b>soy</b> <b>milk</b> mixed with a coagulant. Tofu comes in a variety of textures, depending on water content, from firm, medium firm, and extra firm for stews and stir-fries; to soft or silken for salad dressings, desserts, and shakes. Soy is also eaten in the form of tempeh and texturized vegetable protein (TVP); also known as textured soy protein (TSP), the latter is often used in pasta sauces.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{excretion}} of fecal sterols and bile acids {{was measured}} in five infants from the 1 st week of life to 2 or 3 months of age as the composition of their diet was changed from cow <b>milk</b> to <b>soy</b> bean <b>milk.</b> Bile acid excretion, adjusted for body weight, was initially lower during the 1 st than during the 3 rd week, when it reached adult values. The average excretion of bile acids was 6. 8 mg/kg per day with <b>soy</b> bean <b>milk</b> and 3. 6 mg/kg per day with cow milk. Net sterol excretion (total sterol output minus cholesterol intake) was also twice as high with <b>soy</b> bean <b>milk</b> and probably reflected enhancement of cholesterol re-excretion {{as well as of}} synthesis since the cholesterol content of soy beans is nil. However, net sterol excretion remained higher with soy bean than with cow milk even when egg yolk cholesterol was added to the <b>soy</b> bean <b>milk.</b> It is concluded that the substitution of <b>soy</b> bean <b>milk</b> for cow milk, which lowered the plasma cholesterol in all infants (even in the presence of dietary cholesterol) leads to an increase in bile acids and probably also in cholesterol excretion in young infants.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Soy</b> skim <b>milks</b> {{fermented}} with lactobacilli contain various phytochemicals such as isoflavones and peptides. We used lactobacilli-fermented <b>soy</b> skim <b>milk</b> as {{a nutritional}} supplement for 6 weeks to investigate its anti-osteoporosis effect in 13 -month-old female BALB/c aging mice. Freeze-dried powder of <b>soy</b> skim <b>milk</b> fermented by Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101 (NTU 101 F) and L. plantarum NTU 102 (NTU 102 F) {{were used in}} this study. RESULTS: The trabecular bone volumes in mice fed NTU 101 F and NTU 102 F increased {{by a factor of}} 3. 48 and 2. 16 compared with control values, respectively. The network density and thickness of distalmetaphyseal trabecular bone in mice fedwithNTU 101 F and NTU 102 F milks were significantly denser than that of control mice; moreover, the NTU 101 F group had the largest resting area ratio and smallest resorbing area compared with other groups. The beneficial effect may due to isoflavones as well as higher amounts of polysaccharide and peptide in NTU 101 F milk. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that dietary supplement with fermented <b>soy</b> skim <b>milk</b> can attenuate aging-induced bone loss in BALB/c mice and possibly lower the risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis in aging.

All the samples analyzed showed concentration levels below the maximal levels established by Regulation EC 1259 / 201120. PCB concentrations were {{higher than those of}} PCDD/Fs; oil supplements were the most contaminated samples [1. 8 pg of WHO-TEQ/g of lipid weight (lw) ] followed by chicken eggs (1. 3 pg of WHO-TEQ/g of lw), cow's milk (0. 23 pg of WHO-TEQ/g of lw), biscuits (0. 15 pg of WHO-TEQ/g of lw), <b>soy</b> <b>milks</b> (0. 11 pg of WHO-TEQ/g of lw), and soy lecithin (0. 049 pg of WHO-TEQ/g of lw). The most abundant non-dl-PCBs were PCBs 52 and 101 in cow's <b>milk,</b> <b>soy</b> products, and biscuits, while in chicken eggs and oil supplements, they were PCBs 153 and 138. PCBs 118 and 105 were the most frequent dl-PCBs in all samples. Only oil supplements presented quantifiable concentrations for almost all PCDD/Fs, OCDD and OCDF being the most abundant. The estimated daily intake was 2. 7 pg of WHO-TEQ/day for chicken eggs, 0. 91 pg of WHO-TEQ/day for cow's milk, 0. 45 pg of WHO-TEQ/day for <b>soy</b> <b>milks,</b> and 0. 44 pg of WHO-TEQ/day for biscuits.
