500|$|Vidal's claim about a homoerotic subtext is hotly debated. Vidal {{first made}} the claim in an {{interview}} in the 1995 documentary film The Celluloid Closet, and asserted that he persuaded Wyler to direct Stephen Boyd to play the role {{as if he were a}} spurned homosexual lover. Vidal said that he believed that Messala's vindictiveness could only be motivated by the feeling of rejection that a lover would feel, and claimed to have suggested to Wyler that Stephen Boyd should play the role that way, and that Heston be kept in the dark about the Messala character's motivations. Whether Vidal wrote the scene in question or had the acting conversation with Wyler, and whether Wyler shot what Vidal wrote, remain issues of debate. Wyler himself said that he did not remember any conversation about this part of the script or Boyd's acting with Gore Vidal, and that he discarded Vidal's draft in favor of Fry's. Morgan Hudgens, publicity director for the film, however, wrote to Vidal in late May 1958 about the crucial scene, and implied there was a homosexual context: [...] "...the big cornpone [...] really threw himself into your 'first meeting' scene yesterday. You should have <b>seen</b> <b>those</b> boys embrace!" [...] Film critic F. X. Feeney, in a comparison of script drafts, concludes that Vidal made significant and extensive contributions to the script.|$|E

Rothkopf stated that: [...] "But the true value of this raw rehearsal footage is its emphasis, less known, on MJ's laserlike attention to detail, as he works his band and troupe up to speed. A firm floor manager himself, he's often exposed — and probably wouldn't have approved of this film. (One on one, High School Musicals Kenny Ortega, meanwhile, treats him with kid gloves: [...] "I agree, Michael.") But to see him sweetly lose himself in [...] "Human Nature" [...] ("I like living this way...") is to feel a creature of the stage finally returned home, and possibly on the cusp of redemption." [...] Peter Paras, of E! Online felt that watching Jackson and his performances in a positive aspect is the [...] "genius and the sadness of the entire film." [...] He did note that Jackson's performance of [...] "Earth Song," [...] which consists of using Jackson's voiceover to emphasize his environmental concerns while a bulldozer threatens to eat him, was well-intentioned — because it brought attention to environmental concerns — but felt it was a little over the top. Paras felt the film showed an [...] "exacting and refreshingly funny side of Jackson to be revealed" [...] and [...] "had Jackson lived, we never would have <b>seen</b> <b>those</b> moments" [...] and felt the film was a proper way to [...] "finally say goodbye" [...] to Jackson.|$|E

500|$|The Coen {{brothers}} {{first met}} Sam Raimi when Joel Coen {{worked as an}} assistant editor on Raimi's The Evil Dead (1981). Together, they began writing the script for The Hudsucker Proxy in 1981, and continued during the filming of Crimewave (1985), and post-production on Blood Simple (1985), in which Joel and Ethan Coen shared a house with Raimi. The Coens and Raimi were inspired by the films of Preston Sturges, such as Christmas in July (1940) and the Hollywood satire, Sullivan's Travels (1941). The sentimental tone and decency of ordinary men as heroes was influenced by films of Frank Capra, like Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), and It's a Wonderful Life (1946). The dialogue is an homage to Howard Hawks' His Girl Friday (1940), while Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance as fast-talking reporter Amy Archer is reminiscent of Rosalind Russell and Katharine Hepburn, in both the physical and vocal mannerisms. Other movies that observers found references to include Executive Suite (1954) and Sweet Smell of Success (1957). The brothers had no intention commenting on or parodying such movies, instead as Ethan said [...] " [...] It's the case where, having <b>seen</b> <b>those</b> movies, we say ' They're really fun - let's do one; as opposed to 'They're really fun- let's comment upon them." [...] Raimi describes the script as [...] " [...] "big-business comedy. It's {{a return to the}} very large love story comedies they used to make in the forties and early fifties." [...] So the brothers started to pace around their apartment, taking turns on the typewriter, and when they found themselves stuck at a point, Raimi would do all sorts of tricks to get the boys back up. For example, while Ethan is pacing around, he would move things around the apartment so Ethan would be thrown off, he even said he threw firecrackers at them.|$|E

2500|$|The {{short story}} [...] "Everyday Use" [...] by Alice Walker {{illustrates}} {{the voice of}} a black rural middle class woman through the relationship that a black woman shares with her two daughters Dee and Maggie. Dee is spoiled and believes that her education and experiences make her better than her mother and her sister. On the other hand, Maggie envies her sister for her the beauty and arrogance that always gets her what she wants. Historically, it has been very common for people of color to have their stories told by Caucasians. However, Walker attempts to break this tradition by having a black rural middle class woman tell the story of her relationships with her two daughters. An important part of the story occurs when the mother in [...] "Everyday Use" [...] states, [...] "You've no doubt <b>seen</b> <b>those</b> TV shows where the child who has [...] "made it" [...] is confronted, as a surprise, by her own mother and father, tottering in weakly from backstage… Sometimes I dream a dream in which Dee and I are suddenly brought together on a TV program of this sort…". Here the mother reminisces about a family experience that she has witnessed on television that she wishes she could have for herself. A heart-warming scene similar to the one that the mother witnessed on television does not take place when her daughter Dee comes to visit. Instead when Dee comes to visit the mother a rough, awkward tension-filled encounter slowly unfolds. Walker employs this story and its context to illustrate that a majority of womanism is characterized by black women telling their stories.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1943, {{following}} {{a meeting between}} General Giraud and General de Gaulle in Algiers, orders went out for the AS and ORA to cooperate in operations against the Germans. One {{of the most famous}} of all the Resistance actions took place on 11 November 1943 in the town of Oyonnax in the Jura mountains where about 300 maqusiards led by Henri Romans-Petit arrived to celebrate the 25th anniversary of France's victory over Germany in 1918 wearing improvised uniforms. There were no Germans in Oyonnax that day and the gendarmes made no effort to oppose the resistance, who marched through the streets to lay a wreath shaped like the Cross of Lorraine at local war memorial bearing the message [...] "Les vainqueurs de demain à ceux de 14-18" [...] ("From tomorrow's victors to those of 14-18"). Afterwards, the people of Oyonnax joined the maquisards in singing La Marseillaise as they marched out, an incident given much play on the BBC's French language service about how one town had been [...] "liberated" [...] for a day. The people of Oyonnax paid dearly for their defiance as the next month, the SS arrested 130 people and sent them to the concentration camps while the town's doctor was shot and two other people, including the gendarme captain who failed to resist the maquis on 11 November were tortured before being deported. On 29 December 1943, the AS and the Communist FTP [...] agreed to co-operate whose actions were to controlled by the COMAC (Comité Militaire d'Action-Committee for Military Action) which in turn took its orders from the CNR. The Communists agreed for unity largely out of the belief that they would obtain more supplies from Britain this way, and in practice the FTP continued to go its own way. The SOE provided training for the resistance, through as the SOE agent Roger Miller noted after visiting a resistance workshop making bombs in late 1943: [...] "If the instructors from the training schools in England could have <b>seen</b> <b>those</b> Frenchmen making up charges the cellar would looked to them like Dante's Inferno. Every conceivable school [...] "don't" [...] was being done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vidal's claim about a homoerotic subtext is hotly debated.

Vidal further claimed that Wyler took his advice. Whether Vidal wrote the scene in question or had the acting conversation with Wyler, and whether Wyler shot what Vidal wrote, remain issues of debate. In 1980, Wallace biographers Robert and Katharine Morsberger said that Vidal's contribution to the script remained unclear. Heston has asserted that Wyler felt Vidal did not solve the problem of motivation, and that Wyler shot little of what he wrote or made little contribution to the script. Wyler himself says that he does not remember any conversation about this part of the script or Boyd's acting with Gore Vidal, and that he discarded Vidal's draft in favor of Fry's. Film critic Gary Giddins also dismisses Vidal's claims, concluding that 80 percent of the script had been written [...] "years before" [...] Vidal came aboard the production. However, Jan Herman, one of Wyler's biographers, asserts [...] "there is no reason to doubt" [...] Vidal's claim, and that Wyler's inability to remember the conversation was just part of the director's notorious caginess. There appears to be some contemporary support for Vidal's assertions. [...] Morgan Hudgens, publicity director for the film, wrote to Vidal in late May 1958 about the crucial scene, and implied there was a homosexual context: [...] "...the big cornpone [...] really threw himself into your 'first meeting' scene yesterday.

2500|$|In the 1950s the Athletics chant of {{the school}} (adapted by the Christian Brothers from their Australian schools) was urangabe, urangabe, urangabe uranga/Woolagalla, woolagalla, rumba/Flay them, beat them, yah mung do!/Christies, Christies, blue, gold, blue. One old boy, at SPC in the mid 1950s, has written that the Christian Brothers (being then [...] "Aussies") were not much {{interested}} in Rugby but {{were more interested in}} cricket, [...] "square-bashing" [...] and athletics. However, John Tamihere, at St Peter's in the 1970s, remembers the Christian Brothers (by then mostly Kiwi) being very enthusiastic about Rugby. He has written that if the Christian Brothers wanted a boy for the First XV, the boy didn't have much say in the matter. [...] "They would walk around the school grounds at lunchtime sizing up" [...] likely candidates to see if they might be any good. They picked out one boy because he looked usefully tall. [...] "I'd rather play soccer", the boy protested, [...] " ... but next minute there he was in the lineout, leaping." [...] Under such pressure, Tamihere played for the college First XV (in 1975 and 1976) although he would have preferred to play Rugby League for the Point Chevalier Pirates and later for the Glenora Bears as his brothers did. He said that the college First XV at that time was composed of [...] " ... not bad players", and they were [...] " ... always competitive". [...] "We didn't win a lot, {{but on the other hand}} we never really got hammered". [...] "St Peter's used to play St Kentigern's, who were led out onto the field by their pipe band. When we played Anglican King's College there was no doubt this was a Catholic versus [...] "Proddy" [...] battle, though some of our toughest games were against other Catholic schools like St Paul's and Sacred Heart. If you think Māori society was tribal, you should have <b>seen</b> <b>those</b> Catholics". There is also strong traditional Rugby rivalry with other schools such as De La Salle College, Auckland Grammar School, Kelston Boys' High School, Mt Albert Grammar School and the North Shore school, Rosmini College (The Battle of the Bridge). An annual senior rugby fixture between Auckland Grammar and St Peter's (The Battle of the Overbridge) is played for the Henry Cooper-Br. Paddy Ryan Rugby Challenge Cup in memory of headmasters in office in 1962 when St Peter's beat Grammar for the first time. [...] Amongst the college's Rugby highlights was winning by the First XV of the New Zealand Secondary School's Top Four Championship and the Auckland Secondary Schools Premiership in 1987. [...] The latter feat was repeated in 1988. The college won the Auckland Championship and the New Zealand First XV Knock out competition undefeated in 2000. The college has held the Moascar Cup (national school 1st XV rugby honour) twice, in 1977 and 2000.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} give a better insight in [...] "the humours and actions in a case" [...] marshal draws {{the image of the}} [...] "Goat" [...] in Long Lane as a windmill, saying that its {{functioning}} depends on gaming houses, bawdy-houses, receivers and thief-takers the same way as windmill's on four sails. All four of them are regulated by the thief-taker of course. Besides denouncing him as a protector of coiners, prostitutes, etc. Hitchen coins the name of the thief-maker for Wild, used to refer to him by others later. Through a fictional character's eyes, that is some countryman, Hitchen tries to give a panoramic view of the [...] "Goat" [...] with old thieves, spies, suspicious women, Lemon himself sitting in the corner filling remorse for betrayal. This portrayal is considered somewhat clumsy alongside the insertion of [...] "proclamation", a parody of Wild's advertisements, {{in the middle of the}} pamphlet. Here, Wild proclaimed as [...] "His Skittish and Baboonish Majesty", assures the thieves of himself to be better equipped for subverting the course of justice and offers his legal protection and higher financial terms compared to those of their older [...] "locks, fences and flash pawnbrokers". Hitchen finishes his treatise with the list of [...] "flash cases" [...] and Wild's [...] "weekly pensioners". The list of convicts awaiting transportation under the [...] "Transportation Act"(introduced as an alternative punishment to hanging) enables dating of the pamphlet between June to August. As for the publishers, they were Warner and B. Boreham, publishing Wild's responding pamphlet in May.(p.102-104, Howson)Wild's [...] "Answer" [...] was written anonymously and polished most likely by a hack for two guineas. He refers mostly to the years 1713-1714 for he had personal experience of marshals adventures and could not resist the temptation to describe them, including the scene [...] "in a Sodomitish Academy". As other dealings are mentioned while reviewing their partnership, it is more interesting to describe the event when the under-marshal took his assistant, a buckle-maker as Wild refers to himself in his pamphlet, to a house near Old Bailey one night. The buckle-maker, having never met the types marshal was too willing to see, followed him and to his great surprise discovered men talking and behaving in effeminate way. No less surprising appeared marshal's reaction on being referred to as [...] "your Ladyship" [...] or [...] "Madam", even more, he [...] "dallied with the young sparks with a great deal of pleasure". However, no sooner had he <b>seen</b> <b>those</b> who might have exposed his [...] "power of securing the lads to himself", he flew into a rage and threatened to [...] "spoil their diversion". Later that night, marshal lurked with several constables near Mother Clap's House in Fleet street, Holborn, knowing that a masquerade would be held as usual and he would be able to catch several sodomites dressed in woman's apparel, which he did. Next morning detainees stood before the Lord Mayor and were committed to workhouse, but before were ordered to walk through the streets on the way in their bizarre look:"Some were completely rigg'd in gowns, petticoats, head cloths, fine lac'd shoes, furbelow scarves, and masks. Some had riding hoods; some were dressed like shepherdesses, others like milkmaids with fine green hats..." [...] etc. Some time later they were released after Hitchen's application to the Lord Mayor having been threatened by one of them for his previous adventures with them. The experience appeared too humiliating for one of them and in few days he died after the release. Wild completes the narrating with recommending the under-marshal and his expertise to anyone interested in [...] "Sodomitish Academy".|$|E
