5|$|Danebury was {{abandoned}} around 100BC, {{in common with}} the trend across Britain for hill forts to fall out of use around that time. Once again, the east gate was burnt down, although this time it was not replaced. Most of the inhabitants deserted Danebury, and groups of bodies were disposed of in charnel pits. The site continued in use, but on a much smaller scale than before. Buildings were left to decay and the interior of the fort became used for grazing. By the start of the 1st centuryAD, the settlement of Danebury was probably nothing more than a <b>single</b> <b>farm.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Bronze Age started around 1800 BC, {{and saw the}} {{establishment}} of the first hill fort settlements. A transition from hunting-fishing-gathering subsistence to <b>single</b> <b>farm</b> based settlement started around 1000 BC, and was complete {{by the beginning of the}} Iron Age around 500 BC. Large amount of bronze objects indicate existence of an active communication with Scandinavian and Germanic tribes.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy has}} evolved {{significantly}} {{since it was}} created by the Treaty of Rome (1957). Substantial reforms over the years have moved the CAP away from a production-oriented policy. The 2003 reform has introduced the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) or as it is known as well the <b>Single</b> <b>Farm</b> Payment (SFP). The most recent reform was made in 2013 by Commissioner Dacian Ciolos and applies for the period 2014 to 2020.|$|E

25|$|Dubmill is {{situated}} on the B5300 coast road, and is served by a bus which, as of mid-2015, runs between Silloth-on-Solway {{in the north and}} Workington in the south. The bus is run by local company Reay's, and calls once every two hours in either direction during the day. However, Dubmill today is a very small settlement, consisting of a <b>single</b> <b>farm,</b> and thus has no amenities or facilities of its own. In nearby Allonby, there is a convenience store, leisure centre, post office, fish-and-chip shop, and even an antiques shop, as well as several pubs and restaurants. There is also a pub in Mawbray, called The Lowther.|$|E
25|$|Patent Rolls {{and similar}} reveal the Vale was {{originally}} a farm with several tenants and later it became {{in effect a}} <b>single</b> <b>farm</b> (Langley Bottom Farm) and that after the Black Death or at least after the 14th century it started to disappear from the map. In a document dated 1255/1268 the land appears to be held by a William de Langley. John at Ley from Headley takes it on in 1331/2 and again in 1333/4, succeeding John de Langley. In 1347/8 the tenant is a John at Ley then the records give out. In 1435/6 another John Langley is tenant as subtenant of a William de Langhead of Epsom. The manorial survey of 1496 suggests it was being farmed as a single holding.|$|E
25|$|Swine {{influenza}} {{was first}} proposed to be a disease related to human flu during the 1918 flu pandemic, when pigs became ill {{at the same}} time as humans. The first identification of an influenza virus as a cause of disease in pigs occurred about ten years later, in 1930. For the following 60 years, swine influenza strains were almost exclusively H1N1. Then, between 1997 and 2002, new strains of three different subtypes and five different genotypes emerged as causes of influenza among pigs in North America. In 1997–1998, H3N2 strains emerged. These strains, which include genes derived by reassortment from human, swine and avian viruses, have become a major cause of swine influenza in North America. Reassortment between H1N1 and H3N2 produced H1N2. In 1999 in Canada, a strain of H4N6 crossed the species barrier from birds to pigs, but was contained on a <b>single</b> <b>farm.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2013, {{as part of}} a European Union (EU) member state, Scottish farmers {{received}} £583 {{million in}} subsidy payments from the EU under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Annual CAP payments are made to the UK, which then determines how much to allocate to each of the devolved administrations, including Scotland. In the last CAP agreement, farmers in the UK qualified for additional convergence payments because Scottish farmers receive a lower average <b>single</b> <b>farm</b> payment per hectare, mainly due to the mountainous terrain in Scotland. Supporters of independence therefore believed that an independent Scotland would receive greater agricultural subsidies than when part of the UK. Opponents of independence believed that Scottish farmers benefited because the UK was one of the larger EU member states and therefore had a greater say in CAP negotiations. They also questioned whether an independent Scotland would immediately receive full subsidy payments from the EU, as recent new member states had their subsidies phased in.|$|E
25|$|The company {{launched}} Novak Café & Restaurant in 2008 in the Belgrade {{municipality of}} Novi Beograd, the flagship location in a franchised chain of theme café-restaurants. During 2009, two more locations were added—one in Kragujevac {{and the other}} in Belgrade, the city's second, in September at the neighbourhood of Dorćol overlooking the playing courts of Serbia Open whose inaugural edition took place several months earlier. On 16 December 2011 a location in Novi Sad was opened, however, it operated just over three years before closing in late March 2015. It was announced in late 2012 that Djokovic had purchased the entire existing 2013 production of donkey cheese, which is produced by a <b>single</b> <b>farm</b> in Serbia. It was believed that it was done to ensure a reliable supply for his chain of restaurants in Serbia. One week later, it was proven that the story was exaggerated. Banja Luka in neighbouring Republika Srpska got its Novak Café & Restaurant location on 16 October 2015 within Hotel Trešnja on Banj hill.|$|E

500|$|Hoskins {{begins his}} chapter on {{industrialisation}} with the remark [...] "England {{was still a}} peaceful agricultural country {{at the beginning of}} the seventeenth century." [...] He describes the early industrial landscape, water power and early mills, steam power and slums. He names transformative inventions such as Kay's flying shuttle of 1733 and Hargreaves's spinning jenny of 1767, and comments that Matthew Boulton opened his steam engine factory [...] "in the still unravished country" [...] outside Birmingham in 1765. He quotes a poem by Anna Seward lamenting the ravishing of Coalbrookdale, c. 1785, and one by Wordsworth from The Excursion. He is critical of the industrial slums and the smoke and dirt of the Staffordshire Potteries. He emphasises the rapid growth of industrial towns like Preston, and of new towns like Middlesbrough, which went from a <b>single</b> <b>farm</b> in 1830 to over 50,000 inhabitants in 1880. However he appreciates the mining landscapes of Cornwall, including the gleaming white china clay pits of St Austell and the abandoned tin mines of St Cleer, commenting that [...] "there is a point, as Arthur Young saw, when industrial ugliness becomes sublime".|$|E
500|$|At the {{commencement}} of the Early modern period James, 2nd Lord Hamilton became a privy counsellor to his first cousin, James IV of Scotland and helped to arrange his marriage to Princess Margaret Tudor of England. As a reward he was created Earl of Arran in 1503. The local economy {{for much of this}} period was based on the run rig system, the basic crops being oats, barley and potatoes. The population slowly grew to about 6,500. In the early 19th century Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852) embarked on a programme of clearances that had a devastating effect on the island's population. These [...] "improvements" [...] typically led to land that had been rented out to as many as 27 families being converted into a <b>single</b> <b>farm.</b> In some cases, land was promised in Canada for each adult emigrant male. In April 1829, for example, 86 islanders boarded the brig Caledonia for the two-month journey, half their fares being paid for by the Duke. However, on arrival in Quebec only [...] was made available to the heads of extended families. Whole villages were removed and the Gaelic culture of the island devastated. The writer James Hogg wrote: [...] "Ah! Wae's me. I hear the Duke of Hamilton's crofters are a' gaun away, man and mother's son, frae the Isle o' Arran. Pity on us!". A memorial to this has been constructed on the shore at Lamlash, paid for by a Canadian descendant of the emigrants.|$|E

[...] Around this time, Hastings and the high-class neighbouring planned development of St Leonards-on-Sea had begun to develop rapidly as fashionable seaside resorts, helped by better transport connections and royal patronage. [...] New turnpikes were built northwards to Sedlescombe in 1837 and Battle the following year to reduce the road distance from Hastings and St Leonards-on-Sea to London; the roads met at Silver Hill Farm, and the area began to develop as a suburb, with a windmill, hotel (the Tivoli) and tearooms. [...] By 1839, a combined pottery and brickworks building and cottages for its workers also existed.|$|E

30|$|In fact, the {{integration}} of wind power can have adverse effects on power systems, which are caused by volatility in the overall wind power network, rather than the power output volatility of local or <b>single</b> wind <b>farms.</b> This is because that a power system is a large inertial system with a strong anti-interference capacity.

6000|$|Such is {{the history}} of most of the {{original}} titles to the many estates that dotted the region we have described, prior to the revolution. Money and favouritism, however were not always the motives of these large concessions.

He did not know how to tell her boldly that he lamented this change from the estate to the farm because he had hoped that she would share the one with him, and did not dare even to ask her to share the other. She understood it all, down to the look of displeasure which crossed his face as he felt the possible effect of his own speech. She understood it all, but she could not give him much help,--as yet.
