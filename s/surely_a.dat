He was, perhaps, the first English speaking person to establish a significant commercial lumber business in Canada.

25|$|Several factors {{contribute}} to the development of relatively large sea caves. The nature of the zone of weakness itself is <b>surely</b> <b>a</b> factor, although difficult to quantify. A more readily observed factor is the situation of the cave’s entrance relative to prevailing sea conditions. At Santa Cruz Island, the largest caves face into the prevailing northwest swell conditions—a factor which also makes them more difficult to survey. Caves in well-protected bays sheltered from prevailing seas and winds tend to be smaller, as are caves in areas where the seas tend to be calmer.|$|E
25|$|As {{regards the}} Old Testament, the antiquity of the version is {{admitted}} on all hands. The tradition, however, {{that part of}} it was translated from Hebrew into Syriac for the benefit of Hiram in the days of Solomon is <b>surely</b> <b>a</b> myth. That a translation was made by a priest named Assa, or Ezra, whom the king of Assyria sent to Samaria, to instruct the Assyrian colonists mentioned in 2 Kings 17, is equally legendary. That the translation of the Old Testament and New Testament was made in connection with the visit of Thaddaeus to Abgar at Edessa belongs also to unreliable tradition. Mark has even been credited in ancient Syriac tradition with translating his own gospel (written in Latin, according to this account) and the other books of the New Testament into Syriac.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{characters}} of McCarthyism was John Peurifoy, who was sent as the ambassador of the United States to Guatemala, as {{this was the first}} country in the American sphere of influence after World War II that included elements openly communists in his government. He came from Greece, where he had already done considerable anticommunist activity, and was installed as ambassador in November 1953, when Carlos Castillo Armas was already organizing his tiny revoucionary army. After a long meeting, Peurifoy made it clear to President Arbenz that the US was worried about the communist elements in his government, and then reported to the Department of State that the Guatemalan leader was not a communist, but that <b>surely</b> <b>a</b> Communist leader would come after him; furthermore, in January 1954 he told Time magazine: American public opinion could force us to take some measures to prevent Guatemala from falling into the orbit of international communism.|$|E

500|$|Despite Morrell's {{exposure}} as a fraud, {{following the}} Margaret Oakley debacle, [...] his contemporaries did not uniformly denounce him. To some, he was [...] "the biggest liar in the Pacific", while d'Urville, who had earlier warmly praised Morrell's Four Voyages account, {{turned on the}} American and accused him of fabricating many of his supposed discoveries. However, Jeremiah Reynolds, who had expressed scepticism over the narrative, included Morrell's Pacific discoveries in his report to Congress A Report in relation to islands, reefs, and shoals in the Pacific Ocean.

Angry, he said: [...] "What did the insults from Pernambuco require? <b>Surely</b> <b>a</b> punishment, and such a punishment that it will serve as an example for the future." [...] The rebels were never able to secure control over their provinces, and were easily suppressed. By late 1824, the rebellion was over. Sixteen rebels were tried and executed, while all others were pardoned by the Emperor.|$|E

We'd sort of forgotten the single was even coming out, but the video makes it all seem quite exciting." [...] The Sun commented that [...] "has done the impossible – made the blue rinse sexy". Anna Pickard from The Guardian heavily compared Aguilera to Britney Spears in the video, saying: [...] "We're at a final count of four Christinas to five Britneys. [...] We can't be seen to have achieved a perfect Xtina/Britney balance. [...] We'd probably need a guest appearance from Madonna for that".

Nature, like a loving mother, is ever trying to keep land and sea, mountain and valley, each in its place, to hush the angry winds and waves, balance the extremes of heat and cold, of rain and drought, that peace, harmony, and beauty may reign supreme. There is a striking analogy between matter and mind, and the present disorganization of society warns us that in the dethronement of woman we have let loose the elements of {{violence and}} ruin that she only {{has the power to}} curb. If the civilization of the age calls for an extension of the suffrage, <b>surely</b> <b>a</b> government of the most virtuous educated men and women would better represent the whole and protect the interests of all than could the representation of either sex alone." ...|$|E
500|$|In particular, Fodor {{criticizes the}} instrumentalism of Daniel Dennett. Dennett {{maintains}} {{that it is}} possible to be realist with regard to intentional states without having to commit oneself to the reality of mental representations. Now, according to Fodor, if one remains at this level of analysis, then there is no possibility of explaining why the intentional strategy works:There is ... a standard objection to instrumentalism ...: it is difficult to explain why the psychology of beliefs/desires works so well, if the psychology of beliefs/desires is, in fact, false.... As Putnam, Boyd and others have emphasized, from the predictive successes of a theory to the truth of that theory there is <b>surely</b> <b>a</b> presumed inference; and this is even more likely when ... we are dealing with the only theory in play which is predictively crowned with success. It is not obvious ... why such a presumption should not militate in favour of a realist conception ... of the interpretations of beliefs/desires.|$|E
