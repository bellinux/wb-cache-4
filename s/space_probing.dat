With an expected 10 15 (5. 5 × 10 16) muon decays in 2015 – 2016 (2018 and beyond), Mu 3 e has the exciting opportunity to probe a substantial fraction of currently unexplored dark photon parameter <b>space,</b> <b>probing</b> kinetic-mixing parameter, ϵ, {{as low as}} ϵ 2 ∼ 10 − 7 (10 − 8).

40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight gels are {{formed by the}} self-assembly of a suitable small molecule gelator into a three-dimensional network of fibrous structures. The gel properties {{are determined by the}} fiber structures, the number and type of cross-links and the distribution of the fibers and cross-links in <b>space.</b> <b>Probing</b> these structures and cross-links is difficult. Many reports rely on microscopy of dried gels (xerogels), where the solvent is removed prior to imaging. The assumption is made that this has little effect on the structures, {{but it is not clear}} that this assumption is always (or ever) valid. Here, we use small angle neutron scattering (SANS) to probe low {{molecular weight}} hydrogels formed by the self-assembly of dipeptides. We compare scattering data for wet and dried gels, as well as following the drying process. We show that the assumption that drying does not affect the network is not always correct...|$|E
40|$|SummaryCell polarity, {{growth and}} {{signaling}} require organelle transport by cytoskeletal motor proteins that are precisely regulated {{in time and}} <b>space.</b> <b>Probing</b> these complex, dynamic processes requires experimental techniques with comparable temporal and spatial precision. Inducible dimerization offers the ability to recruit motor proteins to organelles in living cells. Approaches include rapamycin-induced dimerization of motors and cargo-bound binding partners [1] or the recent application of the TULIP light-inducible dimerization system [2, 3]. In the latter system, motor recruitment is activated by blue light, and relaxes to an OFF state in the dark within seconds. While rapid relaxation is desirable for some applications, many experiments require sustained motor recruitment. Here, we use a photocaged chemical dimerizer to achieve sustained, spatially-defined motor recruitment to individual organelles with a single pulse of light. We demonstrate the general applicability of the system by recruiting microtubule plus end-directed kinesin- 1 and minus end-directed dynein motors to peroxisomes and mitochondria in HeLa cells and primary neurons, leading to alterations in organelle transport on timescales from 10 minutes after photoactivation...|$|E

40|$|Measurements of the {{production}} of jets in association with a W/Z boson in proton-proton collisions are presented using data collected by the ATLAS experiment at LHC at sqrt s = 8 and 13 TeV. Several kinematic regimes are explored with various approaches to probe different aspects of these processes. The differential cross sections of a Z boson in association with jets with pT > 30 GeV and |y|< 2. 5 at sqrt s = 13 TeV are measured in a fiducial phase <b>space,</b> <b>probing</b> strong interactions that completely dominate in these processes, while measurements of a W boson in association {{with at least two}} jets at high pT and high di-jet invariant mass, where the electroweak production is enhanced, are performed with sqrt s = 8 TeV data. Angular distributions in W+jets events with high pT jets are also measured at sqrt s = 8 TeV focusing on small angular separation between the jets and the W decay products, where contributions from real W emission are expected large. Finally a measurement of the splitting scales occurring in the kt jet-clustering algorithm is presented for final states containing a Z boson at sqrt s = 8 TeV. This measurement based on charged-particle track information constitutes a complementary approach to study jet properties. Data distributions of all the measurements are corrected for detector effects and compared with state-of-art predictions.

40|$|Measurement studies {{published}} in the literature have, for the most part, ignored the population of hosts. While many hosts are hidden behind firewalls and in private address space, {{there is much to}} be learned from examining the population of visible Internet hosts—one can better understand network growth and accessibility and this understanding can help to assess vulnerabilities, deployment of new technologies, and improve network models. This paper is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to measure the population of visible Internet edge hosts. We measure hosts in two ways: via periodic Internet censuses, where we query all accessible Internet addresses every few months, and via surveys of {{a small fraction of the}} responsive address <b>space,</b> <b>probing</b> each address every 11 minutes for one week. These approaches are complementary: a census is effective at evaluating the Internet as a whole, while surveys validate the census and allow observation of the lifetime of typical address occupancy. We find that only 3. 6 % of allocated addresses are actually occupied by visible hosts, and that occupancy is unevenly distributed, with a quarter of responsive / 24 subnets less than 5 % full, and only 9 % of subnets more than half full. We establish an upper-bound on the number of servers in the Internet at 36 million, about 16 % of the responsive addresses. Many firewalls are visible and we observe significant diversity in the distribution of firewalled block size. While the absolute number of firewalled blocks appears stable, the ratio of coverage of visible firewalls to the number of visible addresses is declining, perhaps suggesting increasing use of invisible firewalls. ...|$|E
40|$|The three-point {{correlation}} function (3 PCF) {{is a powerful}} probe to investigate the clustering of matter in the Universe in a complementary way with respect to lower-order statistics, providing additional information {{with respect to the}} two-point {{correlation function}} and allowing us to shed light on biasing, nonlinear processes, and deviations from Gaussian statistics. In this paper, we analyse the first data release of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS), determining the dependence of the three-point correlation function on luminosity and stellar mass at z=[0. 5, 1. 1]. We exploit the VIPERS Public Data Release 1, consisting of more than 50, 000 galaxies with B-band magnitudes in the range - 21. 6 ≲ M_ B- 5 (h) ≲- 19. 9 and stellar masses in the range 9. 8 ≲(M_[h^- 2 M_]) ≲ 10. 7. We measure both the connected 3 PCF and the reduced 3 PCF in redshift <b>space,</b> <b>probing</b> different configurations and scales, in the range 2. 5 <r [Mpc/h]< 20. We find a significant dependence of the reduced 3 PCF on scales and triangle shapes, with stronger anisotropy at larger scales (r∼ 10 Mpc/h) and an almost flat trend at smaller scales, r∼ 2. 5 Mpc/h. Massive and luminous galaxies present a larger connected 3 PCF, while the reduced 3 PCF is remarkably insensitive to magnitude and stellar masses in the range we explored. These trends, already observed at low redshifts, are confirmed {{for the first time to}} be still valid up to z= 1. 1, providing support to the hierarchical scenario for which massive and bright systems are expected to be more clustered.
