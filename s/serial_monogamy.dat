5|$|The {{mating system}} of bears has {{variously}} {{been described as}} a form of polygyny, promiscuity and <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy.</b> During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously {{over a period of several}} days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating system}} of {{pinnipeds}} varies from extreme polygyny to <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy.</b> Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, {{and the remaining}} 13 breed on ice. Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with {{them as well as}} defend them from rivals. Polygynous species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids. Land-breeding pinnipeds tend to mate on islands where there are fewer terrestrial predators. Few islands are favorable for breeding, and those that are tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land and try to mate with as many females as they can; some of them will even fast. If a male leaves the beach to feed, he will likely lose mating opportunities and his dominance. Polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser fur—all traits that help males in fights for females. Increased body weight in males increases the length of time they can fast due to the ample energy reserves stored in the blubber. Larger males also likely enjoy access to feeding grounds that smaller ones are unable to access due to their lower thermoregulatory ability and decreased energy stores. In some instances, only the largest males are able to reach the furthest deepest foraging grounds where they enjoy maximum energetic yields that are unavailable to smaller males and females.|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper shows that Serbia (excluding Kosovo and Metohia), like other Former Yugoslav states, still has not entered 'the second {{demographic}} transition', even though the decline of the universality of marriage has been registered. Instead of behavioral shift towards postmodern, individualised types and forms of unions, the population of contemporary Serbia resorts to the strategy of passive adaptation to persisting structural barriers, which, in the aggregate, are manifested through: the postponement of marriage and ageing of fertility, practical absence of <b>serial</b> <b>monogamies</b> (high-ranking marriages), with the increase of enlarged family households, while on a demographic level, it causes familiar aggravating effects: long-lasting low fertility rates, negative population growth, depopulation and intensive ageing. Such demographic development has been occurring in a specific context of slow social transformation and globalisation (European and global integration). By making reference to the relevant socio-demographic literature and empirical research (national and international), {{the second part of the}} paper examines the hypothesis about relation between the 'decline' of traditional family and possible increase of fertility. We wonder whether the acceleration of the individualisation of marriage and family could be one of potential (unused) ways of rehabilitation of procreation in the forthcoming period, with determined generators of these processes, such as: modifications in the sense of gender equality/flexibility and decrease of the strict intergenerational cohesion, for the purpose of accepting different, pro-active and personally accountable pattern of life? This is the latest innovation in modern, interdisciplinary demography, which relevant authors created on the basis of the analysis of abundant empirical records. Finally, the purpose of this paper is not to disregard the significance of practical policies (population, social, housing, health care and others), which the author of this paper supports, but to point out some indirect means of their more efficient implementation. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{penguins}} practice <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy</b> {{within each}} breeding season. The female lays a single egg, and the co-operation {{of the parents}} is needed if the chick is to survive. After the female lays the egg, she transfers it to {{the feet of the}} waiting male with minimal exposure to the elements, as the intense cold could kill the developing embryo. The male tends to the egg when the female returns to the sea, now even farther away, both to feed herself and to obtain extra food for feeding her chick when she returns. She has not eaten in two months and by the time she leaves the hatching area, she will have lost a third of her body weight.|$|E
500|$|Although female {{converts}} {{were initially}} {{referred to as}} [...] "nurses", Clarence13X renamed them [...] "earths" [...] in 1967.

Women were said to resemble the Earth in their ability to sustain life. Clarence13X had a patriarchal philosophy, and the Five Percenters were initially overwhelmingly male. He spoke in favor of fathers' arranging their daughters' marriages and told women to embody submission by serving their husbands as God. Polygamy or <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy</b> were allowed, and legal marriage was discouraged. Clarence13X encouraged his followers to have many children and discouraged the use of birth control.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>monogamy</b> {{has always}} been closely linked to divorce practices. [...] Whenever {{procedures}} for obtaining divorce have been simple and easy, <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy</b> has been found. As divorce has continued to become more accessible, more individuals have availed themselves of it, and many go on to remarry. [...] Barry Schwartz, author of The Paradox of Choice: Why less is more, further suggests that Western culture's inundation of choice has devalued relationships based on lifetime commitments and singularity of choice. It has been suggested, however, that high mortality rates in centuries past accomplished much the same result as divorce, enabling remarriage (of one spouse) and thus <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Monogamy ( [...] ) {{is a form}} of {{relationship}} in which an individual has only one partner during their lifetime or at any one time (<b>serial</b> <b>monogamy),</b> as compared to polygyny, polyandry, or polyamory. The term is also applied to the social behavior of some animals, referring to the state of having only one mate at any one time.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{societies}} considered monogamous allow divorce without partner consent. In many Western countries, divorce rates roughly approach 50%. Those who remarry do so {{on average}} three times. Divorce and remarriage can thus result in <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy.</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>monogamy</b> creates {{a new kind of}} relative, the [...] "ex-". The [...] "ex-wife", for example, can remain an active part of her [...] "ex-husband's" [...] life, as they may be tied together by legally or informally mandated economic support, that can last for years, including by alimony, child support, and joint custody. Bob Simpson notes that in the British case, it creates an [...] "extended family", that is, a number of households tied together in this way, including mobile children, noting that Britons may have ex‑wives or ex‑brothers‑in‑law, but not an ex‑child. According to him, these [...] "unclear families" [...] do not fit the mould of the monogamous nuclear family.|$|E
2500|$|Other theorists use {{cultural}} factors influencing reproductive success to explain monogamy. During times of major economic / demographic transitions, investing {{more in a}} fewer offspring (social monogamy not polygyny) increases reproductive success by ensuring the offspring themselves have enough initial wealth to be successful. [...] This is seen in both England and Sweden during the industrial revolution and is currently being seen in the modernization of rural Ethiopia. [...] Similarly, in modern industrialized societies, fewer yet better-invested offspring, i.e. social monogamy, can provide a reproductive advantage over social polygyny, but this still allows for <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy</b> and extra-pair copulations.|$|E
2500|$|As a result, bisexuals bear {{a social}} stigma from accusations of {{cheating}} on or betraying their partners, leading a double life, being [...] "on the down-low", and spreading {{sexually transmitted diseases}} such as HIV/AIDS. This presumed behavior is further generalized as dishonesty, secrecy, and deception. Bisexuals {{can be characterized as}} being [...] "slutty", [...] "easy", indiscriminate, and nymphomaniacs. Furthermore, they are strongly associated with polyamory, swinging, and polygamy, the last being an established heterosexual tradition sanctioned by some religions and legal in several countries. This is despite the fact that bisexual people are as capable of monogamy or <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy</b> as homosexuals or heterosexuals.|$|E
2500|$|Its conclusions, summarized, {{were that}} [...] "Sweeping changes are {{occurring}} in the sexual and relational landscape" [...] (including [...] "dissatisfaction with limitations of <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy,</b> i.e. exchanging one partner for another {{in the hope of}} a better outcome"); that clinicians need to start by [...] "recognizing the array of possibilities that 'polyamory' encompasses" [...] and [...] "examine our culturally-based assumption that 'only monogamy is acceptable'" [...] and how this bias impacts on the practice of therapy; the need for self-education about polyamory, basic understandings about the [...] "rewards of the poly lifestyle" [...] and the common social and relationship challenges faced by those involved, and the [...] "shadow side" [...] of polyamory, the potential existing for coercion, strong emotions in opposition, and jealousy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{documentary}} attracted {{some political}} and social commentary in which the penguins were viewed anthropomorphically as having similarities with, and even lessons for, human society. Michael Medved praised the documentary for promoting conservative family values by showing the value of stable parenthood. Medved's comments provoked responses by others, including Andrew Sullivan, who {{pointed out that the}} penguins are not in fact monogamous for more than one year, in reality practicing <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy.</b> Matt Walker of New Scientist pointed out that many emperor penguin [...] "adoptions" [...] of chicks are in fact kidnappings, as well as behaviours observed in other penguin species, such as ill treatment of weak chicks, prostitution, and ostracism of rare albino penguins. [...] "For instance, {{while it is true that}} emperor penguins often adopt each other's chicks, they do not always do so in a way the moralisers would approve of." [...] Sullivan and Walker both conclude that trying to use animal behavior as an example for human behavior is a mistake.|$|E
50|$|However, {{divorce and}} {{remarriage}} are {{relatively easy to}} undertake in these societies.

50|$|It {{is worth}} {{pointing}} out these health concerns {{do not apply}} to open marriage alone. The same health concerns also apply to <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy</b> (i.e., marriage, divorce, and remarriage). <b>Serial</b> <b>monogamy</b> allows the spread of sexually transmitted diseases to multiple partners as infected individuals move from one monogamous relationship to the next monogamous relationship. The numbers of people who engage in <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy</b> are far greater than the numbers of people who engage in open marriages. Around 9 out of 10 people in the United States get married at some point before 50 years of age.Nearly half of these people divorce, and the majority of those who divorce eventually remarry.This means {{a large segment of the}} general population has multiple sex partners through the practice of <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy.</b> In contrast, only 1 to 6 percent of the married population engage in open marriage.It is possible that <b>serial</b> <b>monogamy</b> has a bigger impact on the spread of sexually transmitted diseases in the population as a whole than does open marriage.|$|E
