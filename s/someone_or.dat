5|$|Alternative {{theories}} were advanced. Some {{surmised that}} the money had been found at a distant location by <b>someone</b> (<b>or</b> possibly even a wild animal), carried to the river bank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tina Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself. No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the process}} of {{destroying}} NESTS, he becomes allied with Maxima, a cyborg whose best friend was killed by NESTS agents and is seeking to avenge the death. While Maxima sees K' as a friend and his partner, K' is stoic and cynical. He also meets Whip, who it is revealed is a clone of his sister, Seirah. Even though Whip reveals her identity to K', he ignores this, saying he will do what he pleases. Although he hates The King of Fighters tournaments, he commonly enters them, being asked by <b>someone,</b> <b>or</b> to find NESTS. The participants often criticize him for being antisocial. After destroying NESTS, K' starts recovering his memories, but he suspects he could forget all the people he has met. He also becomes determined to prove he is better than Kyo, instead of being only a clone.|$|E
5|$|Varno said he {{received}} uncredited assistance from {{his friends and}} fellow screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith, the latter of whom won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Defiant Ones (1958). Varno ran lines and ideas by both men and sought advice. Smith in particular inspired lines for the speech made by the monster {{at the end of}} the film, in which the creature discusses how the human characters consider him the embodiment of evil simply because he is different from them. Varno said much of that dialogue from Smith, however, ended up getting cut from the final film. One of the primary themes of the film, as embodied in John Corcoran's attempts to defend the alien creature, was that simply because <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> something is ugly or different does not necessarily make it evil. However, the script also followed a common trait of most horror films of the 1950s that even somewhat understandable monsters are not entirely sympathetic, and the Blood Beast creature proves itself evil by impregnating Corcoran against his will and pursuing world domination.|$|E

25|$|In {{the basic}} {{assumption}} of fight-flight, the group behaves {{as though it}} has met to preserve itself at all costs, and that this can only be done by running away from <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> fighting <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> something. In fight, the group may be characterized by aggressiveness and hostility; in flight, the group may chit-chat, tell stories, arrive late or any other activities that serve to avoid addressing the task at hand. The leader {{for this sort of}} group is one who can mobilize the group for attack, or lead it in flight.|$|E

25|$|The {{opportunity}} cost doctrine was first explicitly formulated by the Austrian economist Friedrich von Wieser {{in the late}} 19th century. Opportunity cost {{is the cost of}} any activity measured in terms {{of the value of the}} next best alternative foregone (that is not chosen).

25|$|Grief is a {{multifaceted}} response to loss, {{particularly to the}} loss of <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> something that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state of loss, and grief is the reaction to that loss.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} those who killed in error went into {{banishment}}. One would go into banishment if, for example, while one was pushing a roller on a roof, the roller slipped over, fell, and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while one was lowering a cask, it fell down and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while coming down a ladder, one fell and killed someone. But one would not go into banishment if while pulling up the roller it fell back and killed <b>someone,</b> <b>or</b> while raising a bucket the rope snapped and the falling bucket killed <b>someone,</b> <b>or</b> while going up a ladder one fell down and killed someone. The Mishnah's general principle was that whenever the death occurred {{in the course of}} a downward movement, the culpable person went into banishment, but if the death did not occur {{in the course of a}} downward movement, the person did not go into banishment. If while chopping wood, the iron slipped from the ax handle and killed someone, Rabbi taught that the person did not go into banishment, but the sages said that the person did go into banishment. If from the split log rebounding killed someone, Rabbi said that the person went into banishment, but the sages said that the person did not go into banishment.|$|E
25|$|Forgiveness in Hinduism {{does not}} {{necessarily}} require that one reconcile with the offender, nor does it rule out reconciliation in some situations. Instead forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being compassionate, tender, kind and {{letting go of the}} harm or hurt caused by <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> something else. Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts, and being able to focus on blissfully living a moral and ethical life (dharmic life). In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes essence of one's personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, without feeling like a victim, free from anger (akrodhi).|$|E
25|$|People with BPD {{can be very}} {{sensitive}} to the way others treat them, by feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness, and intense sadness or anger at perceived criticism or hurtfulness. Their feelings about others often shift from admiration or love to anger or dislike after a disappointment, a threat of losing <b>someone,</b> <b>or</b> a perceived loss of esteem {{in the eyes of}} someone they value. This phenomenon, sometimes called splitting, includes a shift from idealizing others to devaluing them. Combined with mood disturbances, idealization and devaluation can undermine relationships with family, friends, and co-workers. Self-image can also change rapidly from healthy to unhealthy.|$|E
50|$|The genetic fallacy (also {{known as}} the fallacy of origins or fallacy of virtue) is a fallacy of {{irrelevance}} where a conclusion is suggested based solely on <b>someone's</b> <b>or</b> something's history, origin, or source rather than its current meaning or context. This overlooks any difference {{to be found in}} the present situation, typically transferring the positive or negative esteem from the earlier context.|$|R

25|$|Even {{though the}} Greek text is legible {{on the whole}} (see {{transcription}} on the right), much of it remains incomprehensible due to grammatical and syntactical peculiarities, such as they were frequent in magical amulets, and some letter sequences cannot be made any sense of. Nonetheless, one can infer from the intelligible parts that the god Phoebus Apollo is being invoked {{in order to raise}} his arms against <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> something, probably to the advantage of the amulet owner. The wording does not correspond to any other ancient epigraphic and literary texts, providing further evidence that the gold foil is genuine and not a modern forgery.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{things can}} be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, {{although}} {{not in the same}} way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect.) Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. Our two dominoes require <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the harp}} was {{frequently}} seen surmounted by a crown. In this case, the depiction is as heraldic badge, a device used to indicate allegiance to or {{the property of}} <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> something. Elizabeth I used the badge as her second Great Seal of 1586. This motif had earlier featured of the coins of the Lordship of Ireland during the Tudor period and continued to be used on the coins of the Kingdom of Ireland. Following {{the creation of the}} United Kingdom, the device was used on the cap badges of the Royal Irish Constabulary and later the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The badge can be seen today on the cap badge of the Royal Irish Regiment of the British Army. The harp, unsurmounted by a crown, is used as a badge in the Republic of Ireland today, but the harp surmounted by a crown is also found (e.g. in 'colours' ties of Trinity College sports teams).|$|E
