40|$|A resin slurry venting {{analysis}} was conducted to address safety issues associated with overpressurization of ion exchange columns used in the Purex process at the Savannah River Site (SRS). If flow to these columns were inadvertently interrupted, an exothermic runaway reaction could occur between the ion exchange resin and the nitric acid used in the feed stream. The nitric acid-resin reaction generates significant quantities of noncondensable gases, which would pressurize the column. To prevent the column from rupturing during such events, rupture disks are installed on the column vent lines. The venting analysis models accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) tests and data from tests that were performed in a <b>vented</b> <b>test</b> vessel with a rupture disk. The tests showed that the pressure inside the test vessel continued to increase after the rupture disk opened, though at a slower rate than prior to the rupture. Calculated maximum discharge rates for the resin <b>venting</b> <b>tests</b> exceeded the measured rates of gas generation, so the vent size was sufficient to relieve the pressure in the test vessel if the vent flow rate was constant. The increase in the vessel pressure is modeled as a transient phenomenon associated with expansion of the resin slurry/gas mixture upon rupture of the disk. It is postulated that the maximum pressure {{at the end of}} this expansion is limited by energy minimization to approximately 1. 5 times the rupture disk burst pressure. The magnitude of this pressure increase is consistent with the measured pressure transients. The results of this analysis demonstrate the need to allow for a margin between the design pressure and the rupture disk burst pressure in similar applications...|$|R

40|$|In hot, arid regions, yields {{are usually}} low and unstable. Greenhouse {{technology}} can stabilize and improve yields. But its adoption is impeded by {{the requirement of}} large amounts of water for cooling. Evaporative cooling {{is the most common}} method. Arid Area Greenhouse (AAG) is being developed for hot arid regions, particularly to reduce or eliminate the water needed for cooling. To achieve this, AAG employs earth-tube-heat-exchanger (ETHE) and <b>static</b> <b>vents</b> for environmental control. A prototype was installed in 2002 in an arid region, at village Kothara (ƒ� 23 �X 14 N, ƒ� 68 �X 45 E, at 21 m a. s. l.) for study. The single span saw-tooth greenhouse is 20 X 6 X 3. 5 m. The ETHE is buried 3 m deep directly below and coupled to it in closed-loop mode. ETHE is made of a bundle of eight mild steel pipes arranged in two tiers. Each pipe is 23 m long and 20 cm diameter. ETHE provides 20 air changes per hour. Initial cost of ETHE (material, fabrication, transport and installation) was $ 5000, nearly equal to that of greenhouse excluding instrumentation. There are three continuous closable vents - two along the base of long sides and one along the ridge. A retractable shading cover is provided over the roof. The aim was to determine (a) the extent to which ETHE and natural ventilation meet the need for environmental control and the associated costs (b) the extent to which productivity is increased, cropping season extended. By summer of 2007 five rounds of cropping have been done. ETHE was able to heat the greenhouse easily from 9 �XC to 22 - 23 �XC in half hour in the cold winter nights. Static ventilation along with shading was effective for day time control till February keeping the temperature about 34 �XC inside. Subsequently, ETHE was operated. It limited the greenhouse temperature to 36 - 37 �XC with top shaded and crop inside. If grid supply is steady it is operated for five-six hours in the day. House is closed in May-June. Yield of tomato has been close to 2 times that of the open-fields in the province. Water used was 44 % of that used in open-field. The water used was mostly for plants, only a small part was for supplementary cooling using foggers. ETHE and <b>static</b> <b>vents</b> hold promise as environmental control device for greenhouses in hot arid regions.

Commercially available, enhanced-effi ciency N fertilizers were evaluated for their potential to reduce N 2 O emissions from a clay loam soil compared with conventionally used granular urea and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) fertilizers in an irrigated strip-till (ST) corn (Zea mays L.) production system. Enhanced-effi ciency N fertilizers evaluated were a controlled-release, polymer-coated urea (ESN), stabilized urea, and UAN products containing nitrifi cation and urease inhibitors (SuperU and UAN+AgrotainPlus), and UAN containing a slow-release N source (Nfusion).

40|$|In-field {{measurements}} of direct soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions provide critical data for quantifying the net {{energy efficiency and}} economic feasibility of crop residue based bioenergy production systems. A major challenge to such assessments has been the paucity of field studies addressing the effects of crop residue removal and associated best practices for soil management (i. e., conservation tillage) on soil {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and methane (CH 4). This regional survey summarizes soil GHG emissions from nine maize production systems evaluating different levels of corn stover removal under conventional or conservation tillage management across the US Corn Belt. Cumulative growing season soil emissions of CO 2, N 2 O, and/ or CH 4 were measured for 2 – 5 years (2008 – 2012) at these various sites using a standardized <b>static</b> <b>vented</b> chamber technique as part of the USDA-ARS’s Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices (REAP) regional partnership. Cumulative soil GHG emissions during the growing season varied widely across sites, by management, and by year. Overall, corn stover removal decreased soil total CO 2 and N 2 O emissions by - 4 and - 7 %, respectively, relative to no removal. No management treatments affected soil CH 4 fluxes. When aggregated to total GHG emissions (Mg CO 2 eq ha− 1) across all sites and years, corn stover removal decreased growing season soil emissions by − 5 ± 1 % (mean±se) and ranged from - 36 % to 54 % (n= 50). Lower GHG emissions in stover removal treatments were attributed to decreased C and N inputs into soils, as well as possible microclimatic differences associated with changes in soil cover. High levels of spatial and temporal variabilities in direct GHG emissions highlighted the importance of site-specific management and environmental conditions on the dynamics of GHG emissions from agricultural soils...|$|R

Treatments were no-tilled continuous malt barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.) (NTCB), no-tilled malt barley–pea (Pisum sativum L.) (NTB–P), and conventional-tilled malt barley–fallow (CTB–F) (control), each with 0 and 80 kg N ha− 1. Gas fluxes were measured at 3 to 14 d intervals using <b>static,</b> <b>vented</b> chambers from March to November 2008 to 2011. Soil temperature varied but water content was greater in CTB–F than in other treatments. The GHG fluxes varied with date of sampling, peaking immediately after substantial precipitation (3 ̆e 15 mm) and N fertilization during increased soil temperature. Total CO 2 flux from March to November was greater in NTCB and NTB–P with 80 kg N ha− 1 than in other treatments from 2008 to 2010. Total N 2 O flux was greater in NTCB with 0 kg N ha− 1 and in NTB–P with 80 kg N ha− 1 than in other treatments in 2008 and 2011. Total CH 4 uptake was greater with 80 than with 0 kg N ha− 1 in NTCB in 2009 and 2011. Because of intermediate level of CO 2 equivalent of GHG emissions and known favorable effect on malt barley yield, NTB–P with 0 kg N ha− 1 might mitigate GHG emissions and sustain crop yields compared to other treatments in eastern Montana.

Emissions were monitored from six different inorganic N fertilizer sources (urea, ESN 1, SuperU, UAN, UAN+AgrotainPlus, UAN+Nfusion). Each N source was applied {{at a rate of}} 202 kg N/ha, surface band applied near the corn row and watered into the soil the day after application including a subsurface band application of ESN (ESNssb). A check treatment (no N applied since 2000) located in separate plots and a blank treatment (no N applied) located within the N source plots were included. All treatments except the check were located in plots ST in 2009 that had received 202 kg N/ha of ESN. Nitrous oxide fluxes were measured during the growing season using <b>static,</b> <b>vented</b> chambers for gas sample collection, one to three times per week, and analyzed with a gas chromatograph. With the exception of ESNssb, all N sources had significantly lower growing season N 2 O emissions than dry granular urea. Cumulative increases in daily N 2 O fluxes were more rapid for urea and UAN than the other N sources following N fertilizer application. The enhanced efficiency fertilizers (polymer-coated, stabilized, and slow release) sources showed potential for reducing N 2 O emissions during the 2010 growing season. Corn grain yields in 2010 were not significantly different among N sources, but greater than the blank or check treatments with no N applied.

A no-till (NT) cropping systems study initiated in 1999 to evaluate soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential in irrigated agriculture {{was used in this}} study to make trace gas flux measurements for 3 yr to facilitate a complete greenhouse gas accounting of GWP and GHGI. Fluxes of CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O were measured using <b>static,</b> <b>vented</b> chambers, one to three times per week, year round, from April 2002 through October 2004 within conventional-till continuous corn (CT-CC) and NT continuous corn (NT-CC) plots and in NT corn–soybean rotation (NT-CB) plots. Nitrogen fertilizer rates ranged from 0 to 224 kgN ha- 1. Methane fluxes were small and did not differ between tillage systems. Nitrous oxide fluxes increased linearly with increasing N fertilizer rate each year, but emission rates varied with years. Carbon dioxide efflux was higher in CT compared to NT in 2002 but was not different by tillage in 2003 or 2004. Based on soil respiration and residue C inputs, NT soils were net sinks of GWP when adequate fertilizer was added to maintain crop production. The CT soils were smaller net sinks for GWP than NT soils. The determinant for the net GWP relationship was a balance between soil respiration and N 2 O emissions. Based on soil C sequestration, only NT soils were net sinks for GWP. Both estimates of GWP and GHGI indicate that when appropriate crop production levels are achieved, net CO 2 emissions are reduced.

We assessed {{the effects of}} 35 - 56 months of moderate nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) additions on soil N 2 O fluxes and net soil N-cycling rates, and quantified the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification to N 2 O fluxes. In 2008, a nutrient manipulation experiment was established along an elevation gradient (1000, 2000 and 3000 m) of montane forests in southern Ecuador. Treatments included control, N, P and N+P addition (with additions of 50 kg N ha− 1 yr- 1 and 10 kg P ha− 1 yr- 1). Nitrous oxide fluxes were measured using <b>static,</b> <b>vented</b> chambers and N cycling was determined using the buried bag method. Measurements showed that denitrification was the main N 2 O source at all elevations, but that annual N 2 O emissions from control plots were low, and decreased along the elevation gradient (0. 57 ± 0. 26 to 0. 05 ± 0. 04 kg N 2 O-N ha- 1 yr- 1). We attributed the low fluxes to our sites’ conservative soil N cycling as well as gaseous N losses possibly being dominated by N 2. Contrary to the first 21 months of the experiment, N addition did not affect N 2 O fluxes during the 35 - 56 month period, possibly due to low soil moisture contents during this time. With P addition, N 2 O fluxes and mineral N concentrations decreased during Months 35 - 56, presumably because plant P limitations were alleviated, increasing plant N uptake. Nitrogen plus phosphorus addition showed similar trends to N addition, but less pronounced given the counteracting effects of P addition. The combined {{results from this study}} (Months 1 - 21 and 35 - 56) showed that effects of N and P addition on soil N 2 O fluxes were not linear with time of exposure, highlighting the importance of long-term studies...|$|R

40|$|The Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR) {{proposed}} by General Electric (GE) is an advanced light water reactor (ALWR) design that utilizes passive safety systems. The PCCS {{is a series}} of heat exchangers submerged in water and open to the containment. Since the containment is inerted with nitrogen during normal operation, the PCCS must condense the steam in the presence of noncondensable gases during an accident. To model the transient behavior of the SBWR with a system code, the code should properly simulate the expected phenomena. To validate the applicability of RELAP 5 MOD 3. 1. 1, the data from three Phase 1, Step 2 nitrogen <b>venting</b> <b>tests</b> at Toshiba`s Gravity-Driven Integral Full-Height Test for Passive Heat Removal facility and RELAP 5 calculations of these tests were compared. The comparison of the GIRAFFE data against the results from the RELAP 5 calculations showed that it can predict condensation and gas purging phenomena occurring in the long-term decay heat rejection phase. In this phase of the transient, condensation in the PCCS is the only means to reject heat from the SBWR containment. In the two tests where the nitrogen purge vent line was at its deepest submergence in the Suppression Pool (SIP), the RELAP 5 results mirrored the behavior of the containment pressures and of the water levels in the Horizontal Vent (HV) and the nitrogen purge line tube of the GIRAFFE data. However, in the test with the shallowest purge line submergence, there was appreciable direct contact condensation on the pool surface of the HV despite modeling efforts to deter these phenomena. This surface condensation, unobserved in the GIRAFFE tests, was a major cause of RELAP 5 predicting early containment depressurization and the subsequent early rise in HV and nitrogen purge line water levels. The present RELAP 5 MOD 3. 1. 1 interfacial heat and mass transfer model does not properly degrade direct contact steam condensation in the presence of noncondensable gases sitting on a pool...|$|R

This paper reports {{the results of a}} test series for filling a 71 cu ft tank with liquid hydrogen without <b>venting.</b> 22 <b>tests</b> were conducted, 10 with a bottom orifice as the inlet and 12 with a spray bar. Parameters investigated included inlet saturation pressures of approximately 5, 15, and 25 psia, transfer pressures of 20, 30, and 45 psia, and various starting wall temperatures. Of the tests, only the one run at the highest wall temperature (238 R) failed to fill the tank. Test results are compared to a thermodynamic equilibrium model. Overall model-data agreement was good except for the tendency of the model to overshoot during the initial wall cool down of the higher starting wall temperature fills...|$|R

40|$|The Fluid Acquisition and Resupply Experiment, (FARE) is a Shuttle middeck-mounted {{experiment}} to demonstrate techniques for handling liquids in zero gravity for operations such as refueling spacecraft in orbit. The first flight {{took place on}} STS 53 launched December 2, 1992. Eight tests were performed during the mission and the experiment achieved 100 percent mission success. The second flight will be on STS 57, scheduled for launch in June 1993. The objective of FARE I was to demonstrate techniques for controlling {{the position of the}} liquid and gas within a tank during refilling and to better understand the operation of screen-type surface tension devices used to drain tanks in zero gravity. Tests were performed to demonstrate tank refilling, low gravity propellant slosh, and expulsion efficiency of the screen device. Expulsion efficiencies of 97 percent - 98 percent were demonstrated under a variety of flowrates and accelerations. Final fill levels of 60 percent to 80 percent were achieved during the <b>vented</b> fill <b>tests...</b>|$|R

40|$|Deployable gossamer {{structures}} for solar sails {{need to be}} deployed in a controlled way. Several strategies present have the disadvantage that the sail membrane cannot always be tensioned during the deployment process. In combination with a slow deployment, this involves the risk of an entanglement of the sail. Slow deployments of at least several minutes are desirable {{in order to keep}} inertial loads low and to implement Fault-Detection, Fault-Isolation and Recovery Techniques (FDIR). This might further require completely stopping and resuming the deployment process. For gossamer spacecraft based on crossed boom configurations with triangular sail segments, a deployment strategy is described that is assumed to allow such a controlled deployment process. With a combination of folding and coiling, it is ensured that the deployed sail area can be held taut between the partly deployed booms. During deployment, four deployment units with two spools each on which the sail is mounted (a half segment stowed on each) moves away from the central bus unit, the center of the deployed sail. The development was made in the Gossamer- 1 project of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The folding and coiling of the membrane is mathematically modelled. This allows an investigation of the deployment geometry. It provides the mathematical relation between the deployed boom length and the deployed sail membrane geometry. By modelling the coiled zig-zag folding lines it is possible to calculate the deployment force vector as function of the deployment time. The stowing and deployment strategy was verified by tests with an engineering qualification model of the Gossamer- 1 deployment unit. According to a test-as-you-fly approach the tests included vibration <b>tests,</b> <b>venting,</b> thermal-vacuum <b>tests</b> and ambient deployment. In these tests the deployment strategy proved to be suitable for a controlled deployment of gossamer spacecraft. A deeper understanding of the deployment process is gained by analyzing the deployment strategy mathematically...|$|R
40|$|The Solar Sail Propulsion {{investment}} {{area has}} been one of the three highest priorities within the In-Space Propulsion Technology (ISPT) Project. In the fall of 2003, the NASA Headquarters' Science Mission Directorate provided funding and direction to mature the technology as far as possible through ground research and development from TRL 3 to 6 in three years. A group of experts from government, industry, and academia convened in Huntsville, Alabama to define technology gaps between what was needed for science missions to the inner solar system and the current state of the art in ultra 1 ightweight materials and gossamer structure design. This activity set the roadmap for development. The centerpiece of the development would be the ground demonstration of scalable solar sail systems including masts, sails, deployment mechanisms, and attitude control hardware and software. In addition, new materials would be subjected to anticipated space environments to quantify effects and assure mission life. Also, because solar sails are huge structures, and it is not feasible to validate the technology by ground test at full scale, a multi-discipline effort was established to develop highly reliable analytical models to serve as mission assurance evidence in future flight program decision-making. Two separate contractor teams were chosen to develop the SSP System Ground Demonstrator (SGD). After a three month conceptual mission/system design phase, the teams developed a ten meter diameter pathfinder set of hardware and subjected it to thermal vacuum tests to compare analytically predicted structural behavior with measured characteristics. This process developed manufacturing and handling techniques and refined the basic design. In 2005, both contractor teams delivered 20 meter, four quadrant sail systems to the largest thermal vacuum chamber in the world in Plum Brook, Ohio, and repeated the tests. Also demonstrated was the deployment and articulation of attitude control mechanisms. In conjunction with these tests, the stowed sails were subjected to launch vibration and ascent <b>vent</b> <b>tests.</b> Other investments studied radiation effects on the solar sail materials, investigated spacecraft charging issues, developed shape measuring techniques and instruments, produced advanced trajectory modeling capabilities, and identified and resolved gossamer structure dynamics issues.
