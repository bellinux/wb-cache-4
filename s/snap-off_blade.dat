50|$|Olfa Corporation (Orufa Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese {{manufacturer}} of utility knives, founded in 1956 in Osaka, Japan. The name {{is derived from}} the Japanese words oru (折る, bend and break) and ha (刃, blade). The company is known for inventing the <b>snap-off</b> <b>blade</b> and the rotary cutter.|$|E
50|$|Another {{style is}} a snap-off utility knife that {{contains}} a long, segmented blade that slides out from it. As the endmost edge becomes dull, it can be broken off the remaining blade, exposing the next section, which is sharp and ready for use. The snapping is best accomplished with a blade snapper that is often built-in, or a pair of pliers, and the break occurs at the score lines, where the metal is thinnest. When all of the individual segments are used, the knife may be thrown away, or, more often, refilled with a replacement blade. This design was introduced by Japanese manufacturer Olfa Corporation in 1956 as the world's first <b>snap-off</b> <b>blade</b> and was inspired from analyzing the sharp cutting edge produced when glass is broken and how pieces of a chocolate bar break into segments.|$|E
50|$|These <b>snap-off</b> <b>blades</b> {{and their}} {{associated}} handles are now made by many manufacturers in two standard sizes (9 and 18mm).|$|R
