40|$|The {{self-medication}} is {{a behavior}} type that implies to take medications {{according to the}} patient's own initiative, for a relative's advice, <b>sanitary</b> <b>technician</b> or of any person non doctor. They are many {{the factors that influence}} in this behavior type, highlighting the social factors as the group pressure or of our own relatives that offer us an alternative for the solution of our problems of health based on their own experience. It also influences especially the first floor level of people's instruction of the family parents, which ignore the risk that implies the self-medication. Dentro of the economic factors that influence in the self-medication completely highlight the unemployment, the bad work conditions and of life of most of the population and mainly the first floor economic family entrance that doesn't allow them to consent to the services of health that which is translated in the prescription lack by an enabled professional. Dentro of the cultural factors influences the access lack and scarce readiness of information what allows to the pharmaceutical companies to diffuse slanted information that it incites the population to the consumption of supposedly very sure fármacos, this is also joined to the sanitary faulty education with which we count and social-family aspect that allows to improve the knowledge on the rational use of the medication. Objective. To determine the Factors that Influence in the self-medication in people adults in the Four Populated Centers of Half Cuenca of the River Nanay. District San Juan Baustista, 2010. Methodology. Presently investigation work, you uses Qualitative and Quantitative method and a type of Descriptive, Prospective design, Correlacional and Traverse because it has allowed us to determine the factors that influence in the Selfmedication. Main Discoveries. You determines the factors that influence in the self-medication in mature 320 people 20 years old to 59 years of age, both sexes and they were found that the self-medication that one carries out in the 4 rural centers was bigger in the residents of Llanchama with 65. 8 %. The mature population carries out the purchase of the medications in the ambulatory market and with more prevalence Nina's inhabitants carried out it Rumi with 49. 1 %; The medication that the residents of Llanchama acquired was the dolocordralan NF pill with 28. 0 % and the one diagnoses but recurrent it was pain in general with 40. 0 % in this center town. The self-medication that the inhabitants of the 4 rural centers carried out, was with adult it prevailed those that has grade of primary instruction, standing out in Llanchama with 47. 4 % same. Asi a bigger self-medication it prevailed people with economic level under, being considered bigger in Port Almonds and Llanchama with 52. 6 % and people that he/she has a married state as Cohabiting, carried out bigger self-medication and they were the residents of Port Almonds and Llanchama respectively with 57. 9 %. One carries out a bigger self-medication in Port Almonds and it was of the feminine sex with 36. 8 % and in LLanchama of the masculine sex with 36. 8 %; The predominant age of the 4 rural centers went from 50 to 59 years with an average of 35. 05 % in the towns of Zungarococha, Nina Rumi and Llanchama. Conclusions. A high self-medication exists in mature people in the four rural centers, with an average of 60. 03 %, but with more proportion the residents of Llanchama with 65. 8 % and in the illness that but they had self-medication it was the pain in general with 40. 0 % in this population and the acquisition they carried out it in an ambulatory market with 49. 1 % Nina's residents Rumi. The medication that but you automedicaron was the dolocordralan NF pill with 28. 0 % and the residents of Llanchama acquired it. TesisLa automedicación es un tipo de conducta que implica tomar medicamentos según la propia iniciativa del paciente, por consejo de un familiar, técnico sanitario o de cualquier persona no médica. Son muchos los factores que influyen en este tipo de conducta, destacando los factores sociales como la presión de grupo o de nuestros propios familiares que nos ofrecen una alternativa para la solución de nuestros problemas de salud basados en su propia experiencia. También influye el bajo nivel de instrucción de personas especialmente de los padres de familia, los cuales ignoran por completo el riesgo que implica la automedicación. Dentro de los factores económicos que influyen en la automedicación destacan el desempleo, las malas condiciones de trabajo y de vida de la mayoría de la población y sobre todo el bajo ingreso económico familiar que no les permite acceder a los servicios de salud lo cual se traduce en la falta de prescripción por un profesional capacitado. Dentro de los factores culturales influyen la falta de acceso y escasa disponibilidad de información lo que permite a las empresas farmacéuticas difundir información sesgada que incita a la población al consumo de fármacos supuestamente muy seguros, esto además se aúna a la deficiente educación sanitaria con la que contamos y aspecto social-familiar que permita mejorar los conocimientos sobre el uso racional del medicamento. Objetivo. Determinar los Factores que Influyen en la automedicación en personas adultos en los Cuatro Centros Poblados de la Cuenca Media del Río Nanay – Distrito San Juan Baustista, 2010.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{analyzing}} {{the relation between}} the work-related distress with the exposition to ionizing radiations in the radiology technicians, in the hospital environment. Materials and Methods Our present study has been conducted on a group of 36 <b>sanitary</b> <b>technicians</b> (14 women and 22 man, with an average age of 48 ± 10, 1 years) working in the Hospital Radiology Pavilion; 28 of them were less-exposed to radio-active emissions (B Category) and 8 were more exposed to radio-active emissions (A Category). The HSE questionnaire has been administered to all the 36 <b>sanitary</b> <b>technicians.</b> The data analysis and statistical elaboration were conducted using the HSE Tools. After that, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was applied to the comparison of the medians of two independent samples. Results The HSE tools questionnaire’s analysis (made on the whole population) made evident some criticalities in the domains of the managerial support and of the professionals’ relationships: in the B Category group (less- exposed to radio-emissions) further criticalities emerged, in the domain of peer-support and in the change domain. The HSE questionnaire analysis, made adopting the Mann-Whitney non-parametric statistical test, significant statistical differences emerged from 2 questions of the 35 sub-administered questions, regarding the mostly radio-exposed workers. Conclusions From the research analysis, the authors deducted the small relevance of the emerged criticalities for the two groups of workers; the researchers also believe that, given the (almost complete) homogeneity of the results emerging from the statistical analysis (done with the Mann Whitney test), the perception of the of the work-related distress risk is irrelevant to the dose of ionizing radio-expositio...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} Project HOPE, an American medical aid agency, and its work in Tunisia. More specifically {{this is a}} study of the implementation strategies of those HOPE sponsored projects and programs designed to solve the problems of high morbidity and infant mortality rates due to environmentally related diarrheal and enteric diseases. Several environmental health programs and projects developed in cooperation with Tunisian counterparts are described and analyzed. These include (1) a paramedical manpower training program; (2) a national hospital sanitation and infection control program; (3) a community sewage disposal project; (4) a well reconstruction project; and (5) a solid-waste disposal project for a hospital. ^ After independence, Tunisia, like many developing countries, encountered several difficulties which hindered progress toward solving basic environmental health problems and prompted a request for aid. This study discusses the need for all who work in development programs to recognize and assess those difficulties or constraints which affect the program planning process, including those latent cultural and political constraints which not only exist within the host country but within the aid agency as well. For example, failure to recognize cultural differences may adversely affect the attitudes of the host staff towards their work and towards the aid agency and its task. These factors, therefore, {{play a significant role in}} influencing program development decisions and must be taken into account in order to maximize the probability of successful outcomes. ^ In 1969 Project HOPE was asked by the Tunisian government to assist the Ministry of Health in solving its health manpower problems. HOPE responded with several programs, one of which concerned the training of public health nurses, <b>sanitary</b> <b>technicians,</b> and aids at Tunisia 2 ̆ 7 s school of public health in Nabeul. The outcome of that program as well as the strategies used in its development are analyzed. Also, certain questions are addressed such as, what should the indicators of success be, and when is the time right to phase out?^ Another HOPE program analyzed involved hospital sanitation and infection control. Certain generic aspects of basic hospital sanitation procedures were documented and presented in the form of a process model which was later used as a 2 ̆ 2 microplan 2 ̆ 2 in setting up similar programs in other Tunisian hospitals. In this study the details of the 2 ̆ 2 microplan 2 ̆ 2 are discussed. The development of a nation-wide program without any further need of external assistance illustrated the success of HOPE 2 ̆ 7 s implementation strategies. ^ Finally, although it is known that the high incidence of enteric disease in developing countries is due to poor environmental sanitation and poor hygiene practices, efforts by aid agencies to correct these conditions have often resulted in failure. Project HOPE 2 ̆ 7 s strategy was to maximize limited resources by using a systems approach to program development and by becoming actively involved in the design and implementation of environmental health projects utilizing 2 ̆ 2 appropriate 2 ̆ 2 technology. Three innovative projects and their implementation strategies (including technical specifications) are described. ^ It is advocated that if aid agencies are to make any progress in helping developing countries basic sanitation problems, they must take an interdisciplinary approach to progrm development and play an active role in helping counterparts seek and identify appropriate technologies which are socially and economically acceptable. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Bio {{medical waste}} {{collection}} and proper disposal {{has become a}} significant concern for both the medical and general community. Objective: To know the awareness and practice of biomedical waste management (BMW) among health care personnel working at a tertiary care centre. Methods: The study was conducted from January 2013 to June 2013. It was a descriptive observational hospital based cross sectional study. Study participants included the resident and intern doctors, nursing staff, laboratory <b>technicians,</b> <b>sanitary</b> staff (ward boys, aaya and sweepers) working in the P D U Government Medical College and Civil Hospital, Rajkot who are dealing with BMW. The study was conducted by using pretested, semi-structured pro forma. Results: Total 282 health care personnel participated, including 123 resident and intern doctors, 92 nursing personnel, 13 laboratory <b>technicians</b> and 54 <b>sanitary</b> staff. Only 44. 3 % study participants received training for bio medical waste management. Except for doctors (98. 4 %), awareness regarding identification and use of color coded bags as per BMW act, was very poor among health care personnel. Record keeping for injuries related to biomedical waste was very poor for all health care personnel. Significant number of paramedics maintained record of BMW at work place, practiced disinfection and segregation of BMW at work place, used personal protective measures while handling BMW. Significant number of resident and intern doctors practiced correct method for collecting sharps and needles than paramedical staff. Conclusion: Intensive training program at regular time interval and a system of monitoring and surveillance about practice of day to day BMW management should be evolved...|$|R
