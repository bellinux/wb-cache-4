40|$|A four-season {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in the North China Plain (NCP) to evaluate crop yield and water productivity of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under sprinkler and surface irrigation. Results show that leaf area index (LAI) of winter wheat was greater and active leaf area lasted for longer in the sprinkler than in the surface irrigated field. Above-ground biomass at harvest was 4 similar to 22. 1 % greater in the sprinkler than in the surface irrigated field, similarly the yield was greater by 11. 5 similar to 50. 9 %. The greater yield was mainly due to the greater weight of 1000 kernels in the sprinkler irrigated field. Seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ET) was lower by 4 similar to 23 %, water productivity (WP) was higher by 18 similar to 57 % and irrigation water productivity (IWP) was higher by 21 similar to 81 % in the sprinkler field than in the surface irrigated field. Statistical analysis of four-season data by using a generalized linear model showed that the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>method</b> significantly increased crop yield, WP and IWP, and significantly decreased crop ET. Crop WP and IWP were also significantly affected by climate conditions and agronomic practices. Therefore, the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>method</b> was recommended as an efficient and water-saving irrigation method for winter wheat cultivars in the North China Plain.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to spatially evaluate land suitability for surface and sprinkler irrigation in the Guang watershed, Ethiopia based on FAO guidelines. Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques were used to develop land suitability map. The 30 m spatial resolution Digital Elevation Model was used to generate slope by using “Spatial Analyst Tool Surface Slope ” in ArcGIS environment. Land characteristics (LCs) used as criteria for irrigation requirements were soil depth, soil texture, electric conductivity, pH, drainage and slope factors. The irrigation suitability map was made by matching between reclassified LCs with irrigation land use requirements (LURs) using GIS model builder. Surface soil samples from different soil types were collected and analyzed in the soil laboratory of Amhara Design and Supervision Works Enterprise (ADSWE). The crop suitability evaluation was made by matching between reclassified LCs of the watershed with crop LURs using GIS model builder.

40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} at Research and Production Farm of Agricultural Faculty, Cukurova University during 1996 and 1997 growing season. In this experiment, different irrigation methods (S: Sprinkler; D: Drip), nitrogen forms (L: Liquid; G: Granule) with various amounts (based on applied line source <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>method,</b> N 1; N 2; N 3 kg/da) and two varieties of watermelon (P: Paladin; M: Madera) were studied. Free water surface evaporation {{was used to determine}} irrigation water amount. In only SL and SGL treatments, three different nitrogen levels were formed providing gradient situation during the irrigation season. Based on the results, irrigation water ranged from 119. 2 mm (first year) to 350. 5 mm (second year). Nitrogen applications varied from 5. 1 kg da- 1 (SL) to 10 kg da- 1 (SG) in the all treatments. Total yield changed between 1325 kg da- 1 (first year) and 5013 kg da- 1 (second year) depending on year and treatments. Although, the highest yield was taken from treatments in which liquid fertilizers were applied for both of the varieties in the first year. The varieties have different response to form and amounts of nitrogen in the second year. In this year, the highest yield was obtained from SG treatment in Paladin variety. The yield decreased only by 12 % in SL treatments that nitrogen was applied in liquid form. In Madera variety, the highest yield was taken from SGL treatments that granule and liquid fertilizer were applied together. The effects of irrigation methods and nitrogen levels on some quality parameters of watermelon were found to be insignificant (P> 0. 05). However, fruit diameter of Madera was larger than Paladin variety. The longest fruit length was measured in Paladin-DL treatment. As a result, it was determined that watermelon yield was increased by nitrogen which was applied through irrigation water. Therefore, it could be said that watermelon yield increased considerably with applying nitrogen together with irrigation water in each irrigation application...|$|E

40|$|Florida is {{riddled with}} sinkholes due to its karst topography. Sometimes these sinkholes can cause {{extensive}} damage to infrastructure and homes. It {{has been suggested that}} agricultural practices, such as <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> used to protect crops, can increase the development of sinkholes, particularly when temperatures drop below freezing, causing groundwater levels to drop quickly during groundwater pumping. In the strawberry growing region, Dover/Plant City, Florida, the effects have caused water shortages resulting in dry- wells and ground subsidence through the development of sinkholes that can be costly to maintain and repair. In this study, we look at how frost-freeze events have affected West Central Florida over the past 25 years with detailed comparisons made between two cold-years (with severe frost-freeze events) and a warm year (no frost-freeze events). We analyzed the spatial and temporal correlation between strawberry farming freeze protection practices and the development of sinkholes/dry well complaints, and assessed the economic impact of such events from a water management perspective by evaluating the cost of repairing and drilling new wells and how these compared with using alternative crop-protection methods. We found that the spatial distribution of sinkholes was non-random during both frost-freeze events. A strong correlation between sinkhole occurrence and water extraction and minimum temperatures was found. Furthermore as temperatures fall below 41 uF and water levels decrease by more than 20 ft, the number of sinkholes increase greatly (N. 10).

The center-pivot was a standard 10 -tower machine, 395 meters in length and 38. 4 meters tower spacing. Three tillage systems were used [...] till-plant (T), disk (D), and subtill (S) which was till-plant with subsoiling between rows with straight single shanks, 360 mm deep, after last cultivation. The soil was a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Argiudolls).

40|$|Many recent {{reviews and}} meta-analyses of N 2 O {{emissions}} {{do not include}} data from Mediterranean studies. In this paper we present a meta-analysis of the N 2 O emissions from Mediterranean cropping systems, and propose a more robust and reliable regional emission factor (EF) for N 2 O, distinguishing the effects of water management, crop type, and fertilizer management. The average overall EF for Mediterranean agriculture (EF Med) was 0. 5 %, which is substantially lower than the IPCC default value of 1 %. Soil properties had no significant effect on EFs for N 2 O. Increasing the N fertilizer rate led to higher EFs; when N was applied at rates greater than 400 kgNha - 1, the EF did not significantly differ from the 1 % default value (EF: 0. 82 %). Liquid slurries led to emissions that did not significantly differ from 1 %; the other fertilizer types were lower but did not significantly differ from each other. Rain-fed crops in Mediterranean regions have lower EFs (EF: 0. 27 %) than irrigated crops (EF: 0. 63 %). Drip irrigation systems (EF: 0. 51 %) had 44 % lower EF than <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> (EF: 0. 91 %). Extensive crops, such as winter cereals (wheat, oat and barley), had lower EFs (EF: 0. 26 %) than intensive crops such as maize (EF: 0. 83 %). For flooded rice, anaerobic conditions likely led to complete denitrification and low EFs (EF: 0. 19 %). Our results indicate that N 2 O emissions from Mediterranean agriculture are overestimated in current national greenhouse gas inventories and that, with the new EF determined from this study, the effect of mitigation strategies such as drip irrigation {{or the use of}} nitrification inhibitors, even if highly significant, may be smaller in absolute terms. </p...|$|R

Irrigation impacts soil moisture and can ultimately influence clouds and precipitation through land–planetary boundary layer (PBL) coupling processes. This dissertation {{is a collection}} of three studies that analyze the impact of irrigation on the atmosphere using NASA modeling tools the Land Information System (LIS) and the NASA Unified Weather Research and Forecasting Model (NU-WRF) framework. ☐ The first study investigates the effects of drip, flood, and <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> on land–atmosphere interactions, including land–PBL coupling and feedbacks at the local scale. The offline and coupled simulation results show that regional irrigation impacts are sensitive to time, space, and <b>method</b> and that <b>irrigation</b> cools and moistens the surface over and downwind of irrigated areas, ultimately resulting in both positive and negative feedbacks on the PBL depending on the time of day and background climate conditions. ☐ The second study assesses the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> scheme physics and model sensitivity to choice of irrigation intensity and greenness fraction over a small, high resolution domain in Nebraska and evaluates the model performance with Cosmic Ray Neutron Probe (CRNP) observations. Results show that differences between experiments are small at the interannual scale, but become more apparent at seasonal and daily time scales. In addition, field-scale heterogeneity resulting from the individual actions of farmers is not captured by the model and the amount of irrigation applied by the model exceeds that applied at the two irrigated fields. However, the seasonal timing of irrigation and soil moisture contrasts between irrigated and nonirrigated areas are simulated well by the model. ☐ The third study assesses the individual and combined impacts of irrigation and wind turbines on surface fluxes, near surface temperature, and humidity. Results show that irrigation repartitions surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, reduces daytime temperatures and increases temperatures at night. Turbines weaken surface sensible heat fluxes minimally during the day but enough at nighttime to slightly reduce near surface temperature. The simulations that include both turbines and irrigation show that wind power production is slightly reduced when irrigation is included and irrigation contributes to a greater reduction in daytime surface sensible heat fluxes than would be realized with only turbines. Taken together, these three studies showcase the dramatic alterations that irrigation induces to the water and energy cycles and demonstrates the potential for human impacts on weather and climate.

40|$|Diurnal {{changes of}} {{photosynthesis}} of winter wheat during grain filling stage under <b>sprinkler</b> and surface <b>irrigation</b> conditions were studied {{in sunny days}} to investigate the differences among photosynthesis features of different <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods.</b> Photosynthesis features including net photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO 2 concentration of winter wheat flag leaves were measured using a portable LI- 6400 photosynthesis system under <b>sprinkler</b> and surface <b>irrigation</b> conditions. The results were as follows; compared with that under surface irrigation condition, the net photosynthesis rate of winter wheat flag leaves under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> was increased, and the intercellular CO 2 concentration was reduced. The transpiration rate and stomatal conductance of winter wheat flag leaf under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> condition were higher than those under surface irrigation condition at photosynthetic midday depression time, but were lower at other diurnal time (12 : 00 ~ 14 : 00). The photosynthetic midday depression under <b>sprinkler</b> and surface <b>irrigation</b> conditions was resulted from the stomatal limitation factor and nonstomatal limitation factor. Under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> condition, it was predominantly due to the stomatal limitation factor caused by decreased photosynthetic capacity of mesophyll cells, while it was predominantly due to stomatal limitation under surface irrigation condition. The {{results indicated that the}} photosynthesis activity of mesophyll cells in winter wheat flag leaves under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> was improved, which made the limiting factor of photosynthesis rate change from nonstomatal limitation to stomatal limitation gradually...|$|R

The {{results showed that the}} influence of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> on evaporation capacity at the top of canopy was not evident. Evaporation capacity at the top of canopy of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> was a little less than that of surface irrigation. The influence of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> on evaporation capacity in canopy was remarkable. Evaporation capacity in canopy of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> field was much less than that of the same height in canopy of surface irrigation field. But evaporation capacity of 100 cm height in <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> field was a little larger than that of the same height in surface irrigation field.

40|$|A two-year {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} {{on the effect of}} <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> on the topsoil structure in a winter wheat field. A border-irrigated field was used as the control group. The total soil porosity, pore size distribution, pore shape distribution, soil cracks and soil compaction were measured. The <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> brought significant changes to the total soil porosity, capillary porosity, air-filled porosity and pore shape of topsoil layers in comparison with the border irrigation. The total porosity and air-filled porosity of the topsoil in the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> were higher than those in the border irrigation. The changes in the air-filled and elongated pores were the main reasons for the changes in total porosity. The porosities of round and irregular pores in topsoil under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> were lower than those under border <b>irrigation.</b> <b>Sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> produced smaller soil cracks than border <b>irrigation</b> did, so <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> may restrain the development of macropore flow in comparison with border irrigation. The topsoil was looser under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> than under border irrigation.

40|$|Groundwater {{contamination}} {{has many}} sources, the routine agricultural application of fertilizers and pesticides {{are recognized as}} significant sources. This field study was initiated and designed to evaluate if there were differences among different irrigation technologies on water and solute transport under field conditions. The modes of water application were flood, sprinkler and drip (line source) with {{the same amount of}} water but different water application rates. Potassium bromide was applied along with irrigation water to assess the leaching behavior of chemicals. The three methods of water application yielded similar patterns of moisture regimes as a function of time. As the flow rate decreases, the gradual transition of moisture was observed with long peaks indicating more uniform water distribution and water availability in the case of drip irrigation. The moisture distribution for post irrigation was not significantly different with time among different irrigation systems. The moisture distribution profiles with depth were statistically different for <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> compared to flood and drip irrigations. There {{was no significant difference between}} flood and drip irrigations. The solute concentration distribution as a function of time exhibited solute pattern differences among <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods.</b> The concentration distribution in flood irrigation was quite different from <b>sprinkler</b> and drip <b>irrigations</b> due to high input flow rate. The post irrigation concentration distribution with time was higher in drip irrigation than those of flood and <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigations.</b> The solute concentration profiles in flood, <b>sprinkler</b> and drip <b>irrigations</b> showed no big differences among <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> with depth up to 55 cm. But the drip irrigation had more solute retained and more uniformity in the soil profile than flood or <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigations.</b> The numerical model "HYDRUS" was used for the simulation of one-dimensional water flow and solute transport in flood, <b>sprinkler</b> and drip <b>irrigations.</b> The dispersivity versus solute profiles exhibited greater vertical variability with depth in flood <b>irrigation</b> than for <b>sprinkler</b> and drip <b>irrigation.</b> The comparative results of model simulation and field observed data for moisture distribution showed good agreement between the observed and the simulated water contents. The model prediction for solute concentration distribution also showed comparable results with field measurements...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of an <b>irrigation</b> survey <b>method</b> for digging up reli-able information to estimate application losses. A sample of 220 tertiary channels was drawn randomly to get information from the growers of the Mirpurkhas subdivision, Jamrao canal irrigation scheme. Pre and post soil moisture status based practical measurements of losses were also carried out at 20 different sites. The results showed that the <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> and soil types have a pronounced effect on application losses whereas crop type has no effect on application efficiency. Drip, <b>sprinkler</b> and furrow <b>irrigation</b> <b>methods</b> showed better performance as compared to other methods (wild flooding, border and basin) used in the study area. The survey based losses results were validated against measured losses whilst values available in literature compared favorably. The overall application losses in the study area were calculated as 23 %. The main assumption for the irrigation survey of knowing the irrigation depth (not target depth in accordance with crop actual demand) and cutoff time for a single irrigation event by farmers was almost fulfilled. Based on the encouraging results of this study, it is concluded that irrigation survey studies are useful in understanding the irrigation scheme losses pattern which in turn provide opportunities for improvement...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} feasibility {{of investing in}} <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> technology for rice production is investigated using linear programming and capital budgeting to identify the net annual benefits and net present value, respectively. Groundwater and both flat rate and volumetrically priced surface water sources of irrigation water are analyzed. Under typical practices occurring in rice production operations in the Texas Rice Belt, <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> technology is not profitable at current water costs. Producers using volumetrically priced surface water have the greatest incentive to consider <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation,</b> but water prices must increase by over 250 percent for the investment in a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> system to become attractive. Yield reductions associated with sprinkle-irrigated rice are a significant disincentive. For equivalent flood and sprinkle-irrigated rice yields, an increase in water prices of over 175 percent is required before the investment in a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> system becomes economically feasible.

40|$|A {{two year}} study was {{conducted}} from 2000 - 2002 {{to evaluate the use}} of overhead <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> for suppressing thrips populations in romaine lettuce. Specifically we looked at how the duration and frequency of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> use reduced adult and larval populations following various irrigation applications employed specifically for thrips suppression. We also evaluated combinations of insecticide spray regimes, used in association with <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> runs, for suppressing thrips populations in both fall and spring seasons. The results of the study demonstrated that overhead <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> has the ability to suppress thrips populations in romaine lettuce. At best, we experienced about 50 % population reduction using only <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> compared with the untreated control during these trials. Sprinkler ruins of durations of > 4 hrs and more than 4 cm of water appeared to provide the minimal necessary for suppression. Furthermore, sprinkle runs of 2 or 3 times weekly appeared to provide the most consistent suppression. In contrast, insecticide sprays consistently provided > 80 % suppression and provided higher yielding and better quality lettuce than sprinklers. The use of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation,</b> in addition to insecticide sprays did not significantly improve thrips suppression or yields. However, <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> is being used season long in some romaine fields and in organic production and should be of benefit for thrips suppression, particularly in organic systems where effective insecticide alternatives are not currently available...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{irrigated}} hectares in eastern Montana and western North Dakota {{continues to increase}} and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) producers are converting from flood to <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation.</b> This study provides needed information on the relative yield and quality of sugarbeet under fur-row-flood <b>irrigation</b> and low-pressure <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Sugarbeet was planted in a field with flood and <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> capability. Half of the planted area was irrigated using furrow flood irrigation and half was irrigated using a low-pressure overhead linear sprinkler system. Ground water was sampled {{during the growing season}} under both irrigation systems and analyzed for nitrate-N concentration. Nitrate-N concentration of irrigation water and run-off water was also measured. The type of irrigation did not affect stand, sucrose concentration, or root yield. Sodium (Na), potassium (K) and amino-N concentrations were significantly greater under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> than under flood irrigation. Because of higher impurities, sugarbeet produced under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> had greater sucrose loss to molasses (SLM) and lower extraction than sugarbeet produced under flood irrigation. Greater nitrate-N concen-tration was detected in ground water under flood <b>irrigation</b> than under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation,</b> and nitrate-N was detected in run-off water from flood irrigation. These data indicate that more leaching and run-off of available N occurs in a flood irrigation system than in a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> system and that sprinkler irrigated sugarbeet probably needs less applied N than flood-irrigated sugarbeet because of reduced N losses to leaching and run-off.
