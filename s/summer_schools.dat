In the district under study, pre-kindergarten English language learner (ELL) {{students are encouraged to}} attend a special <b>summer</b> <b>school</b> program to increase their oral language ability in English. This study compared three groups of children: ELL students attending <b>summer</b> <b>school</b> v. ELL students not attending <b>summer</b> <b>school</b> v. English speaking students not attending <b>summer</b> <b>school.</b> The students' primary reading inventory scores from the end of pre-kindergarten to the middle of kindergarten in the areas of reading, writing and oral language were compared.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of remediating eighth-grade English during <b>summer</b> <b>school.</b> We hypothesized that students who remediated English would perform better than students who did not remediate eighth-grade English in <b>summer</b> <b>school.</b> Data were studied from San Dieguito Union High School District using a sample of fifty-nine students (44 males and 15 females). Twenty-nine students repeated eighth-grade English during <b>summer</b> <b>school</b> in the year 2000. Thirty students did not repeat eighth-grade English. This information was gathered to analyze one piece of the larger issue of retention and what options are successful as alternatives to retention. The effectiveness of SDUHSD <b>Summer</b> <b>School</b> 2000 designed to help students remediate eighth-grade English was analyzed through the use of the following questions: ??? Did students who attended <b>summer</b> <b>school</b> due to failing eighth-grade English perform satisfactorily in the first semester of ninth-grade English? Were they able to pass ninth-grade English? ??? Do students feel <b>summer</b> <b>school</b> prepared them for better performance in ninth-grade English? ??? How do students perceive the quality of instruction in <b>summer</b> <b>school</b> English? ??? What differences do students see between the quality and type of instruction in English during the regular school year as compared to <b>summer</b> <b>school?</b> ??? What are the demographics (gender, ethnicity, socio-economic background) of students who failed eighth-grade English? Effectiveness of <b>Summer</b> <b>School</b> v ??? Are there any demographic differences of students who perform satisfactorily in ninth-grade English as a result of remediating eighthgrade English in <b>summer</b> <b>school?</b> ??? Is the SDUHSD remediation model a realistic option instead of social promotion and retention to help failing students achieve? The effect of <b>summer</b> <b>school</b> on the twenty-nine students who repeated eighth-grade English in <b>summer</b> <b>school</b> was assessed by reviewing their ninth-grade English grades. The grades were then compared to the ninth-grade English grades of the thirty students who failed eighth-grade English but did not attend <b>summer</b> <b>school.</b> A survey was also conducted to record students' perspectives on their experience in <b>summer</b> <b>school.</b> Twenty-eight students were given the eleven question survey. The findings suggest that students who took English during <b>summer</b> <b>school</b> did no better in the first semester of ninth-grade English than students who did not remediate during <b>summer</b> <b>school.</b> However, the results of the survey suggest students' felt they benefited from taking English during <b>summer</b> <b>school.</b> These findings do not portray the <b>summer</b> <b>school</b> program as it was offered the summer of 2000 as the cure for students who are to be retained. The findings suggest SDUHSD implement alternative intervention strategies to offer students help while they are struggling. This is in addition to assessing and improving the current <b>summer</b> <b>school</b> program in order to provide students with additional academic support during the summer...|$|R

25|$|The Derg's (1976) Proclamation No: 103 had public {{ownership}} of schools {{consistent with the}} socialist system. This still left a few private schools for children of politicians and wealthy families resulting in a higher quality of education for these children than for all others. Primary schooling expanded throughout the country with national enrolment reaching 34.1%. There were still regional disparities with more resources going to the south than to the north. Educational quality decreased with expansion largely due to resource scarcity. The Derg tried to resolve the problem of teacher shortage by recruiting 5,500 untrained teachers from those who had completed grade 12. These teachers had to attend government designed <b>summer</b> <b>schools</b> for three years to obtain certification.|$|E

25|$|From around 1922, Pușcariu {{approached}} various {{intellectuals and}} politicians {{with the goal}} of creating new institutions for the preservation of cultural identity. With Vintilă Brătianu and Nistor, he set up the Brătianu Foundation, which financed a network of <b>summer</b> <b>schools</b> for adult education. With Iorga's assistance, Pușcariu established the Museum of the Romanian Language, a research institute he had conceived in early 1917, while on the front. The large group of collaborators and students who advanced the language as an academic discipline {{came to be known as}} the Cluj School of linguistics. Rather than confine himself to a narrow field, Pușcariu incorporated linguistics, history, sociology and even literature into his studies, constantly referring to research in other disciplines. He introduced Romanian linguistics to the theories of Meyer-Lübke, particularly as they related to the form of Latin that underpins the language; to Matteo Bartoli's ideas about the isolated and peripheral position of the language; and to Jules Gilliéron's dialectological notions. In terms of Romanian scholars, he incorporated the archaeological findings of Vasile Pârvan, as well as the sociological and folkloric studies of Simion Mehedinți and Romulus Vuia. His respect for their opinions led him to draw upon the work of Densusianu, Candrea, Constantin C. Giurescu, Iorgu Iordan, Alexandru Rosetti, Alexandru Graur and others. He had over eight hundred articles and numerous books to his name. In 1930, he helped organize a Folklore Archive within the museum building; led by Ion Mușlea, this was the country's first institution dedicated exclusively to the study of its folklore tradition.|$|E
