5000|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that the presence of chlorine and chloramine compounds in municipal water (often deliberately added to retard bacterial growth) will cause deterioration of the internal chemical structure of polybutylene piping and the associated acetal fittings. The reaction with chlorinated water appears to be greatly accelerated by tensile stress, and is most often observed in material under highest mechanical stress such as at fittings, sharp bends, and kinks. Localized <b>stress</b> <b>whitening</b> of the material generally accompanies and precedes decomposition of the polymer. In extreme cases, this stress-activated chemical [...] "corrosion" [...] can lead to through perforation and leakage within a few years, but it also may not fail for decades.

40|$|The {{influence}} of interfacial adhesion on the tensile properties, including toughness, of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) –nitrile rubber (NBR) blends with the morphology of well-dispersed rubber particles {{has been investigated}} using two types of blends. The first type, which contains NBR 26 (NBR with 26 wt% acrylonitrile (AN)), has a higher interfacial adhesion strength than the second type that contains NBR 18. The secant modulus and yield stress of the blends {{were found to be}} independent of interfacial adhesion. On the other hand, the elongation-at-break and toughness (defined as the area under the stress–strain curve to break) depend strongly on the interfacial strength. The effects of rubber particle size, size distribution and rubber volume fraction on the tensile properties have been combined into the effect of a single morphological parameter, the matrix ligament thickness T. Both the elongation-at-break and toughness increase as T decreases. At the blends with stronger interfacial adhesion (PVC–NBR 26) have much higher elongation-at-break and toughness. <b>Stress</b> <b>whitening</b> was observed in all deformed PVC–NBR 18 blends. For PVC–NBR 26 blends, however, <b>stress</b> <b>whitening</b> occurred only at Transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that debonding at the PVC–NBR interface is the sole microvoiding mechanism that causes <b>stress</b> <b>whitening.</b> Department of Applied Physic...|$|E
40|$|The {{deformation}} {{mechanisms of}} rubber toughened polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are studied with fractography of impact fractured samples and tensile dilatometry. The dispersed phase {{consists of a}} mixture of an ethylene-co-propylene rubber (EPR) and a compatibilising agent (E-GMA 8 : copolymer of ethylene and 8 wt% of glycidyl methacrylate). It is found that the ductile fracture behaviour, above the brittle-ductile transition temperature (T-bd), consists of {{a high degree of}} rubber cavitation and extensive matrix shear yielding, both in the fracture plane and the <b>stress</b> <b>whitened</b> zone surrounding the crack. A steep increase in the volume strain upon tensile loading confirms the presence of the rubber voiding mechanism in the PET/(EPR/E-GMA 8) blend system. It is seen that the <b>stress</b> <b>whitened</b> zone below the impact fracture surface consists of different zones, depending on the test temperature. Below Tbd, a layer of a highly deformed structure is followed by a cavitation layer containing {{only a limited number of}} cavitaties. Increasing the temperature, causes the deformation layer to be replaced by a zone lacking structure. It is believed that part of the fracture energy has been dissipated in the form of heat inducing a relaxation in the structure. Dynamical mechanical analysis under superimposed axial stresses reveals that the dispersed rubber particles internally cavitate in the presence of volume strain. At increased volume strains, the biaxial stress state in the cavitated particle is disturbed, resulting in the rupture of the rubber chains closest to the void by a tearing mechanism; revealing that the rubber particle is damaged upon cavitation.

40|$|Abstract. Waste cooking oils are {{problematic}} disposal {{especially in}} the developed countries. Management of such oil is a significant challenge due to the disposal problems and possible contamination {{of the water and}} landfills. Thus, paper presented the synthesized of polyol based on waste cooking oil as raw material to produce Bio-foam polymer. The purpose of the study is to develop the High Density solid Biopolymer (HDB) foam by using hot compression moulding technique. The tensile strength and damping characterization shows a good correlation with it density. The maximum tensile strength of HDB is 4. 89 MPa with Young’s Modulus of 0. 26 GPa. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrograph, shows two characteristic and classified as a brittle and ductile fracture of granular (shiny) texture or cleavage character with little yielding before the sample breaks. Brittle fracture was characterized by rapid crack propagation and ductile fracture by <b>stress</b> – <b>whitening</b> zone meanwhile, the damping characteristics have been studied via vibration test. It is revealed that HDB foam was highly absorbed the vibration frequency up to 19. 2 % as compared to rigid HDB foam of only 5. 7 %. Furthermore, the addition of sandwich layer of the vibrational test were revealed unchanged of the amplitude values...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of whitening a greenhouse roof on microclimate and canopy behaviour was studied during summer in a greenhouse {{located in the}} coastal area of eastern Greece. Measurements of microclimate variables, intercepted net radiation, canopy temperature and canopy transpiration rate (lambdaE(c)) of a well-watered soilless rose canopy (Rosa hybrida, cv. First Red) were carried out over several days before and after roof whitening. Whitening reduced the average glasshouse transmission coefficient for solar radiation from 0. 62 to 0. 31. As a consequence, air temperature, vapour pressure deficit and canopy-to-air temperature difference experienced drastic changes while transpiration rate was not strongly affected, being slightly higher (about 18 %) after whitening. The Bowen ratio beta was highly positive before whitening (beta approximate to 0. 6) and negative (beta approximate to - 0. 5) after whitening. Calculations of the canopy stomatal conductance (g(c)) and crop water stress index clearly showed that the crop was significantly less water <b>stressed</b> after <b>whitening.</b> It {{was found that the}} values of g(c) doubled the day after whitening and tended to increase slightly afterwards. The latter may be ascribed to the recovery of the crop and the emergence of new and healthy leaves. Globally, glass whitening was inexpensive, presented positive effects on both microclimate and crop behaviour and can be considered as an efficient means for alleviating the large heat load during summer in warm countries.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} is to investigate the effect of nano-CaCO 3 coated with different content of stearic acid on fracture toughness of HDPE/CaCO 3 nanocomposite. For this purpose, HDPE/ 10 vol % CaCO 3 nanocomposites were made using a twin-screw mixer-single-screw extruder. Nanocomposite standard samples were prepared via injection molding method. Three-point bending tests and microscopic evaluations were performed. The results of fracture toughness test showed that the addition of uncoated nano-CaCO 3 to HDPE causes to decrease fracture toughness, but it can be increased slightly as stearic acid content added. Also the results showed that the <b>stress</b> <b>whitening</b> zone width depends strongly on both CaCO 3 and stearic acid content...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the morphology, thermal and {{viscoelastic}} properties, deformation and fracture behaviour of {{a commercial}} vinylester resin modified with a biodegradable polymer was investigated. Flexural, impact and fracture tests were per-formed on the blends with different polycaprolactone (PCL) contents. They exhibited improved stiffness and fracture properties {{in comparison to the}} neat resin. From SEM analysis of fracture surfaces, <b>stress</b> <b>whitening</b> and branced frac-ture paths toughening mechanisms were identified. The dependence of the glass transition temperature with PCL con-tent was adequately fitted by simple models available in the literature. From the results of these models along with the results of calorimetric studies and SEM analysis, it can be concluded that the interaction between vinylester and PCL is strong enough to avoid phase separation...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} {{performed}} to acces {{the possibilities of}} implementing a constitutive model, normally used to describe amorphous polymers, to a low crystalline PVC. To simplify the parameter determination process a different approach is used {{in comparison to the}} approach originally used for model-ing of amorphous polymers. During the project the rate dependence of yield could accurately be described. However the rate dependence at large strain deformation was captured less well. Therefore the model should include a second active process,the β process. The pressure dependence was not cap-tured due to unexpected material behaviour. During tensile tests the PVC used during this project showed <b>stress</b> <b>whitening</b> as well as voiding which were not seen at earlier tests on other samples of PVC...|$|E
40|$|Correlations between {{mechanical}} properties and microscopic features were investigated using both unnotched and notched specimens of rubber-toughened PMMA materials in very low to medium range of cross head speeds. It is found that: (1) {{significant difference in}} fracture surface morphologies between pure PMMA and rubber-toughened PMMA of unnotched specimens can be correlated with their difference in modes of failure; and variation of degree of roughness in rubber toughened PMMA can be correlated with variation of Young's modulus which is affected by rubber content; (2) decreasing trend of crack initiation region with increasing speed in notched specimens correlates with that of fracture elongation; and decreasing trend of <b>stress</b> <b>whitening</b> zone in notched specimens with both increasing speed and decreasing rubber content correlates with that of calculated plastic zone and the trend correlates also with that in modulus of toughness...|$|E
40|$|Plane-strain {{fracture}} toughness (KIc) of random short hemp fibre reinforced polylactide (PLA) bio-composites was investigated {{along with the}} effect of loading rate, fibre treatment and PLA crystallinity. Fracture toughness testing was carried out at loading rates varying from 0. 5 to 20 mm/min using single-edge-notched bending specimens with 0 to 30 wt% fibre. KQ (trial KIc) of composites decreased as loading rate increased, until stabilising to give KIc values at a loading rate of 10 mm/min and higher. The reduction of crazing and <b>stress</b> <b>whitening,</b> {{as well as a}} more direct crack path observed in PLA samples combined with reduced plastic deformation observed in composites provided explanation for this reduction. KIc of composites was found to decrease with increased fibre content and fibre treatment with sodium hydroxide. Studies controlling the degree of PLA crystallinity by heat treatment or “annealing” showed that reduction of KIc can be attributed to increased crystallinity...|$|E
40|$|Studies on two {{adhesives}} (Metlbond 1113 and 1113 - 2) {{identified as}} having important applications in the bonding of composite materials are presented. A testing program to ascertain stress-strain, strain-rate, time, yield, and/or failure behavior of these materials in bulk form using uniaxial tensile constant strain-rate, creep, and relaxation tests is described. The stress-strain behavior of each material is shown to be significantly rate dependent. A rate dependent <b>stress</b> <b>whitening</b> (crazing) phenomenon occurs prior to either yield or fracture. A region of linear elasticity, a region of viscoelasticity, and the onset of yielding are identified in the stress-strain behavior. The linear elastic limit and the yield point are shown to be rate dependent and agree well with an empirical equation proposed by Ludwik. A creep to failure phenomenon is shown to exist and is correlated with a delayed yield equation proposed by Crochet. Analytical predictions based on a modified Bingham model are shown to agree well with experimental stress-strain strain-rate data. Analytical predictions based on a modified Ramberg-Osgood equation are also shown for comparison purposes...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of healthy and diseased bone tissue are extensively studied in mechanical tests. Most {{of this research}} is motivated by the immense costs of health care and social impacts due to osteoporosis in post-menopausal women and the aged. Osteoporosis results in bone loss and change of trabecular architecture, causing a decrease in bone strength. To address the problem of assessing local failure behavior of bone, we combined mechanical compression testing of trabecular bone samples with high-speed photography. In this exploratory study, we investigated healthy, osteoarthritic, and osteoporotic human vertebral trabecular bone compressed at high strain rates simulating conditions experienced in individuals during falls. Apparent strains were found to translate to a broad range of local strains. Moreover, strained trabeculae were seen to whiten with increasing strain. We hypothesize that the effect seen is due to microcrack formation in these areas, similar to <b>stress</b> <b>whitening</b> seen in synthetic polymers. From the results of a motion energy filter applied to the recorded movies, we saw that the whitened areas are, presumably, also of high deformation. We believe that this method will allow further insights into bone failure mechanisms, and help toward {{a better understanding of the}} processes involved in bone failure...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} TPU nanocomposites were {{prepared}} by incorporating organically modified layered silicates with controlled particle size. To our knowledge, {{this is the}} first study into the effects of layered silicate diameter in polymer nanocomposites utilizing the same mineral for each size fraction. The tensile properties of these materials were found to be highly dependent upon the size of the layered silicates. A decrease in disk diameter was associated with a sharp upturn in the stress-strain curve and a pronounced increase in tensile strength. Results from SAXS/SANS experiments showed that the layered silicates did not affect the bulk TPU microphase structure and the morphological response of the host TPU to deformation or promote/hinder strain-induced soft segment crystallization. The improved tensile properties of the nanocomposites containing the smaller nanofillers resulted from the layered silicates aligning in the direction of strain and interacting with the TPU sequences via secondary bonding. This phenomenon contributes predominantly above 400 % strain once the microdomain architecture has largely been disassembled. Large tactoids that are unable to align in the strain direction lead to concentrated tensile stresses between the polymer and filler, instead of desirable shear stresses, resulting in void formation and reduced tensile properties. In severe cases, such as that observed for the composite containing the largest silicate, these voids manifest visually as <b>stress</b> <b>whitening...</b>|$|E
40|$|The J-integral {{method to}} {{determine}} the fracture toughness of tough and ductile polymeric materials previously developed {{has been applied to}} the elas-tomer-modified polycarbonates. This investigation compares three different methods to obtain Jc: the conventional crack growth length, the stress whiten-ing zone, and the newly developed hysteresis method. Jc values obtained from these three comparative methods are fairly close. The hysteresis method has the advantage over the other two methods of obtaining Jc without requiring the measurement of the crack growth length or the <b>stress</b> <b>whitening</b> zone, therefore avoiding the controversy in defining crack blunting. Results also indicate that the effect of elastomer quantity in polycarbonate on Jc is insignificant as long as the crack is in a stable condition. Higher elastomer contents in polycarbonate result in higher dJ / d A a, d J / d A 1, and tearing modulus (Tm). This indicates that the elastomer toughening mechanism is due to the increase of the energy required for crack growth extension. The hysteresis loss energy {{is directly related to the}} size of the crack tip plastic zone, and the presence of more elastomer indeed increases the crack tip plastic zone, thus making the polycar-bonate tougher. Besides, the presence of elastomer tends to increase the crack initiation displacement and shift the failure modes from an unstable fracture. Jc and the criterion for crack initiation based on rate change of hysteresis energy are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{testing of}} trabecular bone is mainly {{motivated}} by the huge impact of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women and the aged in society {{in terms of social}} and health care costs. Trabecular bone loss and impairment of its mechanical properties reduce bone strength and increase fracture risk, especially in vertebrae. It is generally accepted that in addition to bone mineral density, microarchitecture and material properties of bone also play important roles for bone strength and fracture risk. In order to overcome the limitations of standard mechanical tests delivering merely integral information about complicated samples, experiments were designed for step-wise mechanical testing with concurrent imaging of trabecular and cortical bone. In this communication we present an approach for real-time imaging of trabecular bone during compression using high-speed photography and investigate the hypothesis whether the whitening of deformed trabeculae is due to microdamage. Experiments on human trabecular bone samples from a healthy male donor revealed that failure of such samples is highly localized in fracture bands. Moreover, strongly deformed trabeculae were seen to whiten, an effect similar to <b>stress</b> <b>whitening</b> in polymers. Scanning Electron Microscopy of the same regions of interest revealed that whitened trabeculae were strongly damaged by microscopic cracks and mostly failed in delamination. Higher resolution images uncovered mineralized collagen fibrils spanning the cracks. The whitening partially faded after unloading of the samples, presumably due to partial crack closure. Overall, high-speed photography enables microdamage detection in real-time during a mechanical test and provides a correlation to recorded stress strain curves...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{bone mineral}} density as a {{surrogate}} to diagnose bone fracture risk in individuals is of limited value. However, there is growing evidence that information on trabecular microarchitecture can improve the assessment of fracture risk. One current strategy is to exploit finite element analysis (FEA) applied to 3 D image data of several mm-sized trabecular bone structures obtained from non-invasive imaging modalities for the prediction of apparent mechanical properties. However, {{there is a lack}} of FE damage models, based on solid experimental facts, which are needed to validate such approaches and to provide criteria marking elastic-plastic deformation transitions as well as microdamage initiation and accumulation. In this communication, we present a strategy that could elegantly lead to future damage models for FEA: direct measurements of local strains involved in microdamage initiation and plastic deformation in single trabeculae. We use digital image correlation to link <b>stress</b> <b>whitening</b> in bone, reported to be correlated to microdamage, to quantitative local strain values. Our results show that the whitening zones, i. e. damage formation, in the presented loading case of a three-point bending test correlate best with areas of elevated tensile strains oriented parallel to the long axis of the samples. The average local strains along this axis were determined to be (1. 6 ± 0. 9) % at whitening onset and (12 ± 4) % just prior to failure. Overall, our data suggest that damage initiation in trabecular bone is asymmetric in tension and compression, with failure originating and propagating over a large range of tensile strains...|$|E
