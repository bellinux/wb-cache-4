40|$|In this paper, I {{analyze the}} visiting records of Japanese General <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> (JGSS) to examine typical visiting patterns. It is very {{important}} to control interviewers’ visits in household interview <b>surveys.</b> In large-scale <b>social</b> <b>surveys,</b> however, direct control of visits is almost impossible. Therefore, it is necessary to use the visiting records as an indirect means. Moreover, the visiting records are effective to maintain and improve response rates of <b>social</b> <b>surveys</b> in the future. Results of the present study clarified the following three points. First, although many interviewers made multiple attempts to contact target subjects, the majority of visits has been completed within one or two weeks. Second, many interviewers visited target subjects on Saturday, Sunday, or National holiday. Third, interviewers typically visited target subjects at similar time frame although the visiting records of all interviewers showed that visiting time was diverse. The Japanese General Social Surveys(JGSS) are designed and carried out by the JGSS Research Center at Osaka University of Commerce(Joint Usage/Research Center for Japanese General <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> accredited by Minister of Education,Culture,Sports,Science and Technology),in collaboration with Institute of Social Science at the University, of Tokyo.

By contrast, the National Survey of Family Growth has found an increase in the share {{of men and women who}} self-report a bisexual orientation in their 2011–2013 study compared to previous surveys. Likewise, in the Second Australian Study of Health and Relationships, whose data was collected in 2012 and 2013, researchers noticed significant growth in the share of women who report bisexual orientation and attraction, and the share of men who report exclusive homosexual attraction, compared to the results of the First Australian Study of Health and Relationships, executed in 2001.|$|E

25|$|Human capital {{explanations}} posit additionally {{that men}} are more likely than women to preference their work life over their family life. However, the General <b>Social</b> <b>Survey</b> found that men were only slightly less likely than women to value short hours, and that preferences for particular job characteristics depended mostly on age, education, race, and other characteristics rather than on gender. In addition, other research has shown that men and women likely hold endogenous job preferences, meaning that their preferences are due to the jobs they hold and those they have held in the past rather than related inherently to gender. After taking into consideration men and women's jobs, there is no difference in their job preferences. Men and women engaged in similar types of work have similar levels of commitment to work and display other similar preferences.|$|E
25|$|What greatly {{facilitates}} statistical accuracy {{by reducing}} non-response bias is that answering questions is sometimes required by law. Some surveys must be answered. This requirement lessens agency expense, practically eliminates non-response bias (a perennial headache for most private market researchers), and improves accuracy. For example, for the General <b>Social</b> <b>Survey,</b> people are selected randomly for 10-minute phone interviews which sometimes ask personal {{questions such as}} wage and salary information. But people must answer these questions and won't be paid for their time. It's required by the Statistics Act 1975. This policy is substantially different from countries such as the United States, where answering official surveys is rarely compulsory, including responding to its census which is done every ten years. Further, if a person doesn't get a census survey for any reason, {{he or she is}} still obligated to visit a local census bureau, get one, fill it out, and return it; the government can't be held accountable for mixing up an address. Questionnaires can be downloaded from the Internet via the Statistics New Zealand website.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{there are}} few reports about how many people disaffiliating from Islam in Muslim {{majority}} countries. The main {{reason for this is}} the social and legal repercussions associated with leaving Islam in many Muslim majority countries, up to and including the death penalty for apostasy. However, the report also suggest that in future, {{it is also possible that}} these societies could allow for greater freedom to religiously disaffiliate. On the other hand the increasingly large ex-Muslim communities in the Western world that adhere to no religion have been well documented. A 2007 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated, as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood. Equally, Darren E. Sherkat questioned in Foreign Affairs whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. Quantitative research is lacking, but he believes the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General <b>Social</b> <b>Survey</b> in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification. Studies show that about half of the 4.2 million persons from Muslim background in Germany are no longer embrace Islam in adulthood. Many of the Muslims who leaves Islam faces social rejection or imprisonment and sometimes murder or penalty. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, there is increasing numbers of Americans who are leaving their faith and becoming unaffiliated and the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. According to Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans, the number of Iranian Americans Muslims decreased from 42% in 2008 to 31% in 2012. On the other hand, conversion into Islam have also been well documented.|$|E
