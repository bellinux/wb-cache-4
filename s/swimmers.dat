5|$|This {{award was}} created in 2003, and then was not awarded in 2004. The award has been won by American <b>swimmers</b> six times, Brazilian and Australian <b>swimmers</b> four times, and Canadian <b>swimmers</b> twice.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Australian <b>swimmers</b> won both {{awards for}} World Swimmer of the Year {{for the first}} time, and in 1995, a {{subcategory}} was inaugurated for Pacific Rim <b>swimmers.</b> A subcategory for disabled <b>swimmers</b> was introduced in 2003, and in the following year, an African award was launched after South Africa became the first country from the continent to win an Olympic relay. In 2005, open water swimming {{was added to the}} Olympic program and another category was duly added.|$|E
5|$|American <b>swimmers</b> {{have been}} the most {{successful}} in winning awards, with 52 titles, more than three times that of Australia (13). Michael Phelps of the United States has won the global award eight times, followed by Katie Ledecky of the United States and Ian Thorpe of Australia with four. Regionally, German, Hungarian and Dutch <b>swimmers</b> have had the most success in Europe, while Australians have won more than three-quarters of the Pacific awards.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Effects of {{drafting}} on the hydrodynamic and metabolic {{responses of}} the drafter behind and {{at the side of}} a passive and an active lead <b>swimmer</b> were related to the influence of a lead <b>swimmer</b> on the flow field of the draftee. Methods: Passive drag of the draft <b>swimmer</b> was compared for the nondrafting condition, in the drafting conditions behind a passive and an active lead <b>swimmer,</b> and at the side of a passive and an active lead <b>swimmer.</b> The effect was also evaluated with oxygen uptake measurements. Fluid pressure measurements were made behind and at the side of a passive and an active lead <b>swimmer</b> to examine the flow field. Results: Behind a passive lead <b>swimmer,</b> passive drag was significantly reduced by 20 %, and behind an active lead <b>swimmer,</b> it was reduced by 9 %. At the side of a passive lead <b>swimmer,</b> passive drag was significantly increased by 9 %, and at the side of an active lead <b>swimmer,</b> it increased by 8 %. Oxygen uptake was significantly reduced by 25 % behind a passive lead <b>swimmer,</b> by 11 % behind an active lead <b>swimmer,</b> and only marginally changed at the side of a lead <b>swimmer.</b> The pressure measurements indicated a 33 % decrease in mean flow velocity behind an active lead <b>swimmer</b> but an increase in peak flow velocities due to the kick of the lead <b>swimmer.</b> These increases could explain the lesser decrease in passive drag behind an active versus a passive lead <b>swimmer.</b> Conclusion: The best position for a draft <b>swimmer</b> was found to be directly behind an active lead <b>swimmer</b> at a distance of 0. 50 m between the toes of lead <b>swimmer</b> and the hands of drafter, with significant reductions in both passive drag and oxygen uptake when drafting. © 2009 The American College of Sports Medicine...|$|R

5|$|As the Australians boasted {{the three}} fastest <b>swimmers</b> in the {{individual}} 100-metre freestyle event, they were clear favourites for the corresponding relay, especially as Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster {{than all of the}} other <b>swimmers.</b> Leech was not assured of a place in the final quartet. In the heats, Fraser and Crapp were rested and the remaining four <b>swimmers,</b> Sandra Morgan, Elizabeth Fraser, Gibson and Leech qualified the team. Leech swam the second leg in 1 minute 5.9 seconds, the second fastest of the Australians, thereby securing her position in the final along with Sandra Morgan, who recorded a time of 1 minute 5.4 seconds. Australia won the second heat by 3.1 seconds to qualify quickest for the final. They were 1.8 and 2.3 seconds faster than South Africa and the United States, respectively, both of whom swam in the first heat. The selection of Leech and Morgan generated controversy. They were Australia's youngest <b>swimmers</b> and lacked experience at open level competition: Morgan had false started twice at the Australian Championships, and both had competed at national level only once.|$|E
5|$|Bikinis {{have become}} a major {{component}} of marketing various women's sports. It is an official uniform for beach volleyball and is widely worn in athletics and other sports. Sports bikinis have gained popularity since the 1990s. However, the trend has raised some criticism as an attempt to sell sex. Female <b>swimmers</b> do not normally wear bikinis in competitive swimming. The International Swimming Federation (FINA) voted to prohibit female <b>swimmers</b> from racing in bikinis in its meeting at Rome in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Swimming is Australia's most {{prolific}} Olympic sport, having {{been responsible for}} 58 of Australia's 143 Olympic gold medals. In addition, {{a list of the}} top 100 Australian Olympians of all time, compiled by the Australian Olympic Committee, named 35 <b>swimmers</b> in the top 100, more than any other sport. <b>Swimmers</b> have been given the honour of carrying the Australian flag six times in twelve at the closing ceremony, which is traditionally reserved for the most successful athlete of the delegation.|$|E
5|$|The Open Water {{award was}} {{introduced}} in 2005, {{when it was announced}} that an open water swimming event would be included in the Olympics for the first time: the 10km events at the 2008 Olympics. The award has been won by Dutch and German <b>swimmers</b> five times, while Russian <b>swimmers</b> have won four times. Thomas Lurz of Germany has won the award five times, triumphing in 2005, 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2013, while Russia's Larisa Ilchenko has won the award {{three years in a row}} (2006–2008).|$|E

5|$|The Pacific Rim {{award was}} {{introduced}} in 1995, the year after two Australian swimmers—Kieren Perkins and Samantha Riley—became the first two Pacific Rim <b>swimmers</b> to be named as World Swimmer of the Year. It has subsequently been dominated by Australian <b>swimmers,</b> who have won 24 of the 32 awards given. Ian Thorpe won six awards (five consecutively) and Susie O'Neill has won four (three consecutively). Australia’s success has been built on female butterfliers (O’Neill and Petria Thomas), female breaststrokers (Riley and Leisel Jones), and male freestylers (Thorpe, Grant Hackett and Michael Klim). The men's awards have been dominated by Asian <b>swimmers</b> since 2006. Kosuke Kitajima (Japan) was the first non-Australian swimmer to win the award more than once (in 2003, 2007, 2008, and 2010). He was followed by Sun Yang of China who won three awards (in 2011, 2012, and 2013).|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, {{changes were}} made in {{classification}} for the breaststroke, bringing {{the total number of}} functional classifications down from ten that had competed in Atlantathe to nine. <b>Swimmers</b> who had been classified as SB10 at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta opted not to compete in Sydney. Several former SB8 and SB9 <b>swimmers</b> moved down a class to compete, and made the finals in their classifications. The IPC's Olympian aspiration to become an premier elite international sporting competition still fell short. In Sydney, 561 gold medals were awarded in 18 sports, compared with 300 in 28 sports at the 2000 Summer Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Canada-born Auburn University alumnus Alana Dillette was {{the only}} swimmer to {{participate}} in the women's 100meters backstroke while representing the Bahamas at the Beijing Olympics. Dillette participated in the preliminary rounds of her event on 10 August, when she swam in the third heat versus <b>swimmers</b> that included Columbia's Carolina Colorado and Israel's Anna Gostomelsky, who ranked, respectively, first and second in that heat. Dillette ranked fourth in the heat with a time of 1:02.56 behind Sweden's Sarah Sjöström by 0.24seconds, and ahead of Hong Kong's Hiu Wai Sherry Tsai by 0.12seconds. Out of the total of 49 <b>swimmers</b> that took part in the preliminary rounds, Dillette ranked 32nd. She did not advance to semifinals later that day.|$|E

5|$|Danielle Beaubrun was {{the only}} Saint Lucian swimmer to {{participate}} in the Beijing Olympics. She was the youngest member of the Saint Lucian delegation, at age 18. The 2008 Summer Olympics served as Beaubrun's Olympic debut. Beaubrun did not initially qualify for Olympic standards. However, because Saint Lucia had no naturally qualifying <b>swimmers,</b> the country was invited by FINA to send two <b>swimmers</b> to the Olympics, granted the swimmer had participated in the 2007 World Championships. Beaubrun met this criterion, and was selected for this reason. At the time, Beaubrun was enrolled at The Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida and trained with coach Sergio Lopez.|$|E
