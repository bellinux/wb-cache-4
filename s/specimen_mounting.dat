The influence of the <b>specimen</b> <b>mounting</b> and the specimen design on the test results was investigated. Three mounting methods were tested.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the failure of a mandrel pin mounted on a rolling contact test bench. For this purpose, different methods of analysis were conducted, including metallography and stress analysis. The stress values in the failed pin were determined by Finite Elements. The high notch effect and the incorrect mounting of the specimens were identified as the failure causes. A pin design change is proposed to reduce the maximum stress even in the case of incorrect <b>specimen</b> <b>mounting...</b>|$|E

The low spring mass (236 mg), spring constant (116 N/m) and damping coefficient (0. 008 Ns/m) of the transducer allows measurement of the damping losses for nanoscale contacts.

40|$|AbstractMany {{innovative}} {{experiments are}} designed to answer research questions about hip biomechanics, however many fail to define a coordinate system. This makes comparisons between studies unreliable and is an unnecessary hurdle in extrapolating experimental results to clinical reality. The {{aim of this study}} was to present a <b>specimen</b> <b>mounting</b> protocol which aligns and registers hip specimens in the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) coordinate system, which is defined by bony landmarks that are identified by palpation of the patient׳s body. This would enable direct comparison between experimental testing and clinical gait analysis or radiographic studies. To represent the intact hip, four intact synthetic full-pelves with 8 full-length articulating femora were assembled and digitised to define the ISB coordinate system. Using our proposed protocol, pelvis specimens were bisected into left and right hemi-pelves and femora transected at the mid-shaft, and then mounted in bone pots to represent a typical experimental setup. Anatomical landmarks were re-digitised relative to mechanical features of the bone pots and the misalignment was calculated. The mean misalignment was found to be less than 1. 5 ° flexion/extension, ab/adduction and internal/external rotation for both the pelves and femora; this equates to less than 2. 5 % of a normal range of hip motion. The proposed <b>specimen</b> <b>mounting</b> protocol provides a simple method to align in vitro hip specimens in the ISB coordinate system which enables improved comparison between laboratory testing and clinical studies. Engineering drawings are provided to allow others to replicate the simple fixtures used in the protocol...|$|E

Furthermore the tensile tester is able to measure the deformation of the specimen directly on the specimen, which allows more precise tests and more independence from temperature and stress dependent tester parts like the clamping and the rods.
