60|$|Was {{not their}} hope in this--twofold hope; from the {{weakness}} of him who had thus counteracted himself; and a hope, still more cheering, from the strength {{of those who had}} been disburthened of a cleaving curse by an ordinance of Providence--employing their most wilful and determined enemy to perform for them the best service which man could perform? The work of liberation was virtually accomplished--we might almost say, established. The interests of the people were taken from a government whose sole aim it had been to prop up the last remains of its own decrepitude by betraying those whom it was its duty to protect;--withdrawn from such hands, to be committed to those of the people; {{at a time when the}} double affliction which Spain had endured, and the return of affliction with which she was threatened, made it impossible that the emancipated Nation could abuse its new-born strength to any <b>substantial</b> <b>injury</b> to itself.--Infinitely less favourable to all good ends was the condition of the French people when, a few years past, a Revolution made them, for a season, their own masters,--rid them from the incumbrance of superannuated institutions--the galling pressure of so many unjust laws--and the tyranny of bad customs. The Spaniards became their own masters: and the blessing lay in this, that they became so at once: there had not been time for them to court their power: their fancies had not been fed to wantonness by ever-changing temptations: obstinacy in them would not have leagued itself with trivial opinions: petty hatreds had not accumulated to masses of strength conflicting perniciously with each other: vanity with them had not found leisure to flourish--nor presumption: they did not assume their authority,--it was given them,--it was thrust upon them. The perfidy and tyranny of Napoleon 'compelled,' says the Junta of Seville in words before quoted, 'the whole Nation to take up arms and to choose itself a form of government; and, in the difficulties and dangers into which the French had plunged it, all--or nearly all--the provinces, as it were by the inspiration of Heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous, created Supreme Juntas--delivered themselves up to their guidance--and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of Spain.'--Governments, thus newly issued from the people, could not but act from the spirit of the people--be organs of their life. And, though misery (by which I mean pain of mind not without some consciousness of guilt) naturally disorders the understanding and perverts the moral sense,--calamity (that is suffering, individual or national, when it has been inflicted by one to whom no injury has been done or provocation given) ever brings wisdom along with it; and, whatever outward agitation it may cause, does inwardly rectify the will.|$|E

5000|$|One {{commentator}} {{noted that}} the message to all companies developing products for the Internet of Things is that “the FTC is watching and has served notice that it intends to {{play an active role}} in enforcing its regulatory authority in that context.” This case, however shows how challenging it will be for the FTC to regulate this new industry. Ultimately this action was based on the misstatements of TRENDnet, rather than the security of the products themselves. [...] On February 4, 2014, the FTC provided a statement to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, stating that Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. §45(a) gives the agency the authority to regulate security standards."If a company makes materially misleading statements or omissions about a matter, including data security, and such statements or omissions are likely to mislead reasonable consumers, they can be found to be deceptive in violation of Section 5." [...] "Further, if a company’s data security practices cause or are likely to cause <b>substantial</b> <b>injury</b> to consumers that is neither reasonably avoidable by consumers nor outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition, those practices can be found to be unfair and violate Section 5." [...] Over the last decade, the FTC has used the authority to punish “unfair” and “deceptive” trade practices to investigate companies that collect, monitor, or use personal information about consumers. As it did in the TRENDnet case, the FTC frequently alleges violations of both provisions in data privacy investigations.|$|E

40|$|Drink driving {{continues}} to be a serious problem on Australian roads, as alcohol-related crashes result in <b>substantial</b> <b>injuries,</b> fatalities and property damage. While legal sanctions such as fines and licence disqualification periods have been effective in preventing {{a large proportion of the}} population from drink driving, sanctions have been relatively ineffective in reducing alcohol-impaired driving among 'hard-core' repeat offenders (Marques, Voas and Hodgins 1998). As a result, drink driving rehabilitation programs and alcohol ignition interlocks are being employed as additional countermeasures to reduce the prevalence of alcohol-related injuries and fatalities on public roads. This report aims to review the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of rehabilitation and interlock programs, and to provide support for the expansion of upcoming Australian interlock trials to include (a) screening and matching procedures, (b) intervention and/or support programs and (c) formative evaluations that focus on a number of measurement outcomes.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{objective}} was to describe the interobserver agreement between trained chart reviewers and physician reviewers in a multicenter retrospective chart review study of children with cervical spine injuries (CSIs). MethodsMedical records of children younger than 16  years old with cervical spine radiography from 17 Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) hospitals from years 2000 through 2004 were abstracted by trained reviewers for a study aimed to identify predictors of CSIs in children. Independent physician‐reviewers abstracted patient history and clinical findings from {{a random sample of}} study patient medical records at each hospital. Interobserver agreement was assessed using percent agreement and the weighted kappa (κ) statistic, with lower 95 % confidence intervals. ResultsModerate or better agreement (κ >  0. 4) was achieved for most candidate CSI predictors, including altered mental status (κ =  0. 87); focal neurologic findings (κ =  0. 74); posterior midline neck tenderness (κ =  0. 74); any neck tenderness (κ =  0. 89); torticollis (κ =  0. 79); complaint of neck pain (κ =  0. 83); history of loss of consciousness (κ =  0. 89); nonambulatory status (κ =  0. 74); and <b>substantial</b> <b>injuries</b> to the head (κ =  0. 50), torso/trunk (κ =  0. 48), and extremities (κ =  0. 59). High‐risk mechanisms showed near‐perfect agreement (diving, κ =  1. 0; struck by car, κ =  0. 93; other motorized vehicle crash, κ =  0. 93; fall, κ =  0. 92; high‐risk motor vehicle collision, κ =  0. 89; hanging, κ =  0. 80). Fair agreement was found for clotheslining mechanisms (κ =  0. 36) and <b>substantial</b> face <b>injuries</b> (κ =  0. 40). ConclusionsMost retrospectively assessed variables thought to be predictive of CSIs in blunt trauma–injured children had at least moderate interobserver agreement, suggesting that these data are sufficiently valid for use in identifying potential predictors of CSI...|$|R
