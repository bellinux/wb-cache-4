40|$|The {{mosquito}} is a {{very important}} vector involved in the worldwide transmission of disease-causing viruses and parasites. Controlling the mosquito population remains one of the best means for preventing the serious infectious diseases of malaria, yellow fever, dengue, filariasis and so on and there has been an increasing interest in developing biopesticides as a useful substitute to chemical insecticides. As a result, Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) has been extensively used due to its specificity and high toxicity to a variety of mosquito larvae. However it is prudent to seek alternatives to Bti with alternative spectra of mosquitocidal activity or that are able to overcome any resistance that might develop against Bti. The <b>Bt</b> <b>S</b> 2160 - 1 strain was isolated from soil samples collected from Southern China and found to have a comparable mosquitocidal activity to Bti. However there were significant differences in terms of their plasmid profiles, crystal proteins produced and cry gene complement. A PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism identification system was developed and used in order to identify novel cry-type genes and four such genes (cry 30 Ea, cry 30 Ga, cry 50 Ba and cry 54 Ba) were identified in <b>Bt</b> <b>S</b> 2160 - 1.

The inclusion proteins were highly expressed with the molecular weight of around 130 kDa illustrated by SDS-PAGE.

40|$|Semi-analytic {{reconstruction}} {{uses the}} analytic {{solution to a}} second-order, steady, ordinary differential equation (ODE) to simultaneously evaluate the convective and diffusive flux at all interfaces of a finite volume formulation. The second-order ODE is itself a linearized approximation to the governing first- and second- order partial differential equation conservation laws. Thus, semi-analytic reconstruction defines a family of formulations for finite volume interface fluxes using analytic solutions to approximating equations. Limiters are not applied in a conventional sense; rather, diffusivity is adjusted {{in the vicinity of}} changes in sign of eigenvalues in order to achieve a sufficiently small cell Reynolds number in the analytic formulation across critical points. Several approaches for application of semi-analytic reconstruction for the solution of one-dimensional scalar equations are introduced. Results are compared with exact analytic solutions to Burger s Equation as well as a conventional, upwind discretization using <b>Roe</b> <b>s</b> method. One approach, the end-point wave speed (EPWS) approximation, is further developed for more complex applications. One-dimensional vector equations are tested on a quasi one-dimensional nozzle application. The EPWS algorithm has a more compact difference stencil than <b>Roe</b> <b>s</b> algorithm but reconstruction time is approximately a factor of four larger than for Roe.
