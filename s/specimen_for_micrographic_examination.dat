40|$|The genome of rat {{mitochondria}} is a covalently closed, circular molecule {{of about}} 106 daltons that replicates in mitochondria {{by means of}} a Cairns-type intermediate. We have been studying the process of mtDNA replication in vitro (Koike et al. 1976) and also analyzing the in-vivo-replicating structures with products obtained by restriction endonuclease diges-tion using electron micrographic and gel electropho-retic techniques (Koike et al. 1975; Koike and Kobayashi 1977). Restriction enzyme EcoRI produced at least six large DNA fragments eparable in the agarose gel, and an order of these fragments was determined.

40|$|A {{deletion}} {{has been}} isolated which fuses galK and presumably galT to the promoter and operator of the bioA operon. The deletion has endpoints in bioA and galE, {{and leaves the}} operator-proximal end of bioA intact and the regulatory sites themselves functional. In bacterial strains which carry the deletion, the expression of galK is regulated by biotin, although due to the inefficiency of the bioA promoter even the fully derepressed level of galactokinase is low.

A proteolytic enzyme catalyzing the limited hydrolysis of carboxymethylated γ′ chain of globulin was found to be present in the protein bodies. The specific activity in the protein body (18 units per milligram protein) was higher than that in the whole cell extract (13 units per milligram protein), indicating that the limited proteolytic enzyme was localized in the protein body...|$|R

40|$|The {{chromium}} nitrides {{effects on}} duplex stainless steels low temperature impact toughness and durability were investigated. A duplex rolled ring was cut as different blocks, and different Cr₂N amounts {{were obtained by}} trial heat treatments, with the solution annealing furnace temperature set at low and high levels, 1040 and 1140 °C respectively, and the transfer time ranging between 5 and 120 s {{in order to prevent}} the σ phase formation. <b>Micrographic</b> <b>examinations,</b> low temperature Charpy impact tests and durability assessments were carried out on specimens sampled from the blocks cores. The material strength was evaluated by hardness tests. The results showed how an increase in transfer time allows the N diffusion in the austenite phase, reducing the nitrides quantity in the ferrite phase. A synergistic effect between the transfer time and the solution annealing temperature on the amount of intermetallic particles was observed. Clear effects of the Cr₂N presence on both material low temperature impact toughness and pitting corrosion resistance were found...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model for the {{structure}} of isolated bovine adrenal medulla chromaffin granules derived from the dependence of granule density on the osmotic pressure of the suspension medium at 2 degrees C. The granule consists of a flexible, inelastic membrane bounding an osmotically active core. The core consists of a solution space and a separate, nonosmotic phase. Since the granule behaves like a "perfect" osmometer over a wide range of osmolarities, we conclude that (a) within these limits, the core consists of a constant amount of condensed material and a constant number of particles in solution, (b) from the constraints of the osmometer model, the osmolality inside the granule must equal the osmolality outside. Therefore the high concentrations of catecholamines (greater than 0. 7 M) and ATP (greater than 0. 18 M) measured biochemically cannot be dissolved in the core solution as separate molecules, but must be condensed into larger aggregates. These results are supported by electron <b>micrographic</b> <b>examination</b> of the effect of osmotic pressure changes on granule morphology...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{aeronautical}} structures, assemblies {{with thin}} laminates {{are becoming increasingly}} usual, especially for fuselage design. In these structures, out-of-plane loads can appear in bolted joints {{and can lead to}} progressive punching of the fastenerâs head in the laminate resulting, in some cases, in a failure mode called pull-through [1]. This complex phenomenon, which occurs in assemblies, was studied firstly by using a simplified ââcircularââ pull-through test method. Qualitative <b>micrographic</b> <b>examinations</b> showed damage very similar to that observed in impacted specimens. The research presented here extends the Discrete Ply Model Method (DPM) developed by Bouvet et al. [2] to this case. The finite elements model is based on a particular mesh taking ply orientations into account. Cohesive elements are placed at the interfaces between solid elements to represent matrix cracks and delamination, thus allowing the natural coupling between these two damage modes to be represented. The model shows good correlation with test results, in terms of load/displacement curve, and correct prediction of the damage map until failure, including the splitting phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The high {{alloying}} {{degree of}} Duplex stainless steels makes them {{susceptible to the}} formation of intermetallic phases during their exposure to high temperatures. Precipitation of these phases can lead to a decreasing of the corrosion resistance and sometimes of the toughness. Starting from the advantages of the synergic Metal Active Gas (MAG) pulsed welding process, this paper analyses the structure formation particularities of homogeneous welded joints from Duplex stainless steel. The effect of linear welding energy on the structure morphology of the welded joints was revealed by macro- and <b>micrographic</b> <b>examinations,</b> X-ray energy dispersion analyses, measurements of ferrite proportion and X-ray diffraction analysis. The results obtained showed that the transformation of ferrite into austenite is associated with the chromium, nickel, molybdenum and nitrogen distribution between these two phases and their redistribution degree is closely linked to the overall heat cycle of the welding process. The adequate control of the energy inserted in the welded components provides an optimal balance between the two microstructural constituents (Austenite and Ferrite) and avoids the formation of undesirable intermetallic phases...|$|R
40|$|The {{so called}} 'nicotine stain' {{documented}} at many locations on the Long Duration Exposure Facility is still unexplained {{as to the}} exact origin and mechanism of deposition, although enough {{is known to have}} some understanding of the conditions coincident for the formation of the deposits. Direct and scattered atomic oxygen flux, and solar ultraviolet radiation interacting with materials outgassing products have all been implicated {{in the formation of the}} dark brown contamination deposits. The nicotine stain represents a potential of performance degradation for spacecraft designed for long term operation in low Earth orbit and therefore, a need exists to characterize this form of spacecraft self contamination and quantify the impact on thermal/optical systems. Optical property measurements in the spectral range of 2 to 10 microns were performed on specimens of the contaminated film. Reflectance measurements of the contaminant film as deposited on the surface and as free standing films are presented along with transmission spectra for the bulk material. Thickness measurements along with <b>micrographic</b> <b>examination</b> of the cross section of the deposit reveal the layered structure of the deposit which further implicates solar illumination as a factor in the deposition mechanism...|$|R

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{study of the}} relationship between the laser process parameters and the mechanical properties of welded high carbon steels was performed utilizing a Lumonics Nd:YAG pulsed laser, operating at 1. 06 μm, and a robotically manipulated fiber optic beam delivery system. A gage plate (0. 88 mm thick) was butt welded with a constant power of 200 W and a He shielding gas was used at a pressure of 5 × 10 4 Pa. The welding performance of the Nd:YAG laser was strongly affected by the translation velocity, pulse length and pulse repetition frequency (PRF). The effects of varying these process parameters were quantified by measuring the sample's hardness profile, weld width, weld penetration, and tensile strength. Furthermore, <b>micrographic</b> <b>examinations</b> were conducted at the welded joints. It was shown that by increasing the pulse length and pulse repetition frequency a deeper weld penetration and a wider bead width were achieved; moreover, the weld region became tougher. Hardness profiles transverse across the weldment and as a function of weld depth were greatly reduced with increasing PRF. The quality of the laser weld was dominated by the rapid quenching rate which resulted in the weld structure being completely modified near the heat affected zone...|$|R
