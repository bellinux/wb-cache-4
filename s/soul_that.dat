5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless <b>soul</b> <b>that</b> wandered eternally.|$|E
5|$|The gods were {{believed}} to manifest in many forms. The Egyptians had a complex conception of the human soul, consisting of several parts. The spirits of the gods were composed {{of many of these}} same elements. The ba was the component of the human or divine <b>soul</b> <b>that</b> affected the world around it. Any visible manifestation of a god's power could be called its ba; thus, the sun was called the ba of Ra. A depiction of a deity was considered a ka, another component of its being, which acted as a vessel for that deity's ba to inhabit. The cult images of gods that were the focus of temple rituals, as well as the sacred animals that represented certain deities, {{were believed}} to house divine bas in this way. Gods could be ascribed many bas and kas, which were sometimes given names representing different aspects of the god's nature. Everything in existence was said {{to be one of the}} kas of Atum the creator god, who originally contained all things within himself, and one deity could be called the ba of another, meaning that the first god is a manifestation of the other's power. Divine body parts could act as separate deities, like the Eye of Ra and Hand of Atum, both of which were personified as goddesses. The gods were so full of life-giving power that even their bodily fluids could transform into other living things; humankind was said to have sprung from the creator god's tears, and the other deities from his sweat.|$|E

5000|$|According to Jain philosophy, this {{universe}} consists of infinite jivas or <b>souls</b> <b>that</b> are uncreated and always existing. There {{are two main}} categories of souls: unliberated mundane embodied <b>souls</b> <b>that</b> are still subject to transmigration and rebirths in this [...] samsara [...] due to karmic bondage and the liberated <b>souls</b> <b>that</b> are free from birth and death.

25|$|The Saṃsāra {{doctrine}} of Buddhism asserts that while beings undergo endless cycles of rebirth, {{there is no}} changeless <b>soul</b> <b>that</b> transmigrates from one lifetime to another - a view that distinguishes its Saṃsāra doctrine from that in Hinduism and Jainism.

25|$|During this period, Ramana {{composed}} The Five Hymns to Arunachala, his magnum opus in devotional lyric poetry. The first hymn is Akshara Mana Malai. It {{was composed}} in Tamil {{in response to}} the request of a devotee for a song to be sung while wandering in the town for alms. The Marital Garland tells in glowing symbolism of the love and union between the human soul and God, expressing the attitude of the <b>soul</b> <b>that</b> still aspires.|$|E
25|$|The veneration of nats also shares similar {{practices}} with Buddhism. In Buddhism, offerings are extremely common and expected. Shrines and temples, {{in which these}} offerings are to be made, are seen in both Burmese folk religion and Buddhism. In both the faiths, many different statues of various deities {{can also be seen}} around the house. Burmese folk religion differs dramatically in the concept of a soul. Buddhism does not believe in a <b>soul</b> <b>that</b> leaves after one dies, but rather a consciousness that is transferred to a new person (consciousness is reborn in another). In contrast, Burmese folk religion holds that the soul can leave the body it inhabits. This soul is often depicted {{in the form of a}} butterfly called a leppya. The act of the soul leaving the host often happens in dreams, or when someone is sick or dying. If one is awoken in the middle of their dream, it is said that their soul might not be back to them yet. If a host tries to live without its soul it will die. When someone is dying, butterfly hunts are often held to try to recapture the <b>soul</b> <b>that</b> has wondered off.|$|E

25|$|If {{the body}} of the Horcrux's creator is destroyed, the person is still able to survive. When {{the body of}} a Horcrux owner is killed, that portion of the <b>soul</b> <b>that</b> had {{remained}} in the body does not pass on to the next world, but will rather exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being resurrected by another wizard, as stated in Half-Blood Prince. If all of someone's Horcruxes are destroyed, then the soul's only anchor in the material world would be the body, the destruction of which would then cause final death.|$|E
