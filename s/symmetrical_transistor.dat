40|$|Complementary bipolar (CBi) {{inverters}} on scaled down self-aligned transistors with highly-doped {{bases for}} advanced high-speed low-voltage low-power deep-submicron ULSI are considered and studied using a simulator PSPICE. A novel <b>symmetrical</b> <b>transistor</b> structure (STS) with undoped (lightly-doped) active base and nanometer regime, that can function as complementary n-p-n and p-n-p devices for CBI inverters at ultra-reduced supply voltages V-EE, V-EE= 0. 1 - 0. 5 V, is investigated and simulated. It is shown that numerical mixed 2 D-device-circuit simulator (DCSIM) for personal computer gives accurate {{knowledge of the}} static and dynamic properties of upward and downward self-aligned STS and CBi inverters eliminating the intermediate nonaccurate procedure of model electrical parameter extraction. This paper presents 2 D numerical device-circuit simulations of the bipolar nanostructures and push-pull inverters on complementary STS with undoped active bases in ultra-low-voltage regime providing {{a high degree of}} integration, extremely high intrinsic speed and sufficiently high driving capacity. The switching problems for high-speed low-power low-action operations and optimization of sub- 0. 5 V Cbi inverters are studied. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2002 We {{present a}} new circuit design for {{adaptive}} offset cancellation in a fully differential 2. 4 GHz CMOS direct conversion mixer. Our circuit structure is {{a modification of}} a Gilbert cell mixer in which offsets are cancelled by injecting cancellation currents into {{the legs of the}} mixer by dynamically varying the bias on the active loads. We present analysis and simulation results of our mixer with offsets present. Offsets create non-linearities in any circuit by differentially shifting the small-signal bias point of a matched pair; forcing once <b>symmetrical</b> <b>transistors</b> to operate in different bias regions and create second order distortion. We focus our design to minimize second order distortion while simultaneously canceling the large offsets found in direct conversion receivers. Simulation results for the mixer canceling a wide range of offsets are included. Our mixer has a gain of 6. 4 dB, an IIP 3 of 17 dBm and a noise figure of 17 dB as simulated in a. 5 Î¼m HP Mosis CMOS process...|$|R
40|$|A new {{physically}} based classical continuous {{potential distribution}} model, particularly considering the channel center, is proposed for a short-channel undoped body <b>symmetrical</b> double-gate <b>transistor.</b> It involves a novel technique for solving the 2 -D nonlinear Poisson's equation in a rectangular coordinate system, {{which makes the}} model valid from weak to strong inversion regimes and from the channel center to the surface. We demonstrated, using the proposed model, that the channel potential versus gate voltage characteristics for the devices having equal channel lengths but different thicknesses pass through a single common point (termed ``crossover point''). Based on the potential model, a new compact model for the subthreshold swing is formulated. It is shown that for the devices having very high short-channel effects (SCE), the effective subthreshold slope factor is mainly dictated by the potential close to the channel center rather than the surface. SCEs and drain-induced barrier lowering are also assessed using the proposed model and validated against a professional numerical device simulator...|$|R
40|$|A {{vertical}} gate <b>symmetrical</b> molecular <b>transistor</b> is demonstrated. It includes self assembled monolayer of ferrocene molecules chemically {{bonded to}} be a flat Au source and Au nanoparticles drain electrodes while gated {{with the central}} gate electrode. Using this configuration, we show that negative differential resistance, symmetrical behavior, and rectification effects can be tuned by controlling the gate voltage. The I-V curves shift from symmetric to strongly rectifying over a gate voltage range of a few tenths of volts around a threshold value where the junction behaves symmetrically. This is due to charging of the nanoparticle contact, which modifies the spatial profile of the voltage across the junction, a {{fact that we have}} included in a simple theoretical model that explains our experimental results quite well. Our device design affords a new way to fine-tune the rectification of molecular devices {{in a way that does}} not necessarily involve the Coulomb charging of the wire...|$|R
40|$|Operational {{amplifiers}} have {{an important}} role as a basic building block in analog circuit design. One of the performance limitations of these circuits is the input referred offset voltage or simply input offset voltage. This voltage can range between 1 - 30 mV depending on the fabrication process and the sizes of the ideally <b>symmetrical</b> input <b>transistors</b> of the differential amplifier. Two new techniques to digitally trim the offset voltage of operation amplifier are presented and discussed. The techniques can be divided into two categories. The first is called weighted current technique, while the second is called weighted voltage technique. The attractive features of the new techniques are the trimming is performed digitally, large dynamic range; require small silicon area, and the ability to provide auto-zero cancellation using extra hardware. In the presented analysis, a binary weighted scheme will be used. However, the techniques are not restricted to that scheme and they are still applicable with other weighting schemes. A detailed analysis of these techniques will be presented and discussed and measurement from fabrication and simulation will be presented...|$|R
40|$|A new FinFET {{memory circuit}} {{technique}} based on asymmetrically gate underlap engineered bitline access transistors is proposed in this paper. The {{strengths of the}} asymmetrical bitline access transistors are weakened during read operations while enhanced during write operations as the direction of current flow is reversed. With the proposed asymmetrical six-FinFET SRAM cell, the read data stability and write ability are both enhanced by up to 6. 12 x and 58 %, respectively, without causing any area overhead {{as compared to the}} standard symmetrical six-FinFET SRAM cells in a 15 nm FinFET technology. The leakage power consumption is also reduced by up to 96. 5 % with the proposed asymmetrical FinFET SRAM cell as compared to the standard six-FinFET SRAM cells with <b>symmetrical</b> bitline access <b>transistors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Noise {{specifications}} for junction field-effect transistors {{are presented in}} different ways depending on the particular semiconductor manufacturer. Arithmetic involved in converting these specifications to equivalent RMS noise in microvolts developed at the preamplifier input terminal is reviewed. These methods were useful for estimating the noise performance of high input impedance preamplifiers used with E-field antennas operating {{in the range of}} 1 KHz to 10 MHz. Both the JFET MPF- 102 transistor and the COS/MOS CA 3600 transistor array provided amplification for VLF receivers where the internally generated noise was well below the atmospheric noise level. The CA 3600 transistor array provided better performance because of the more <b>symmetrical</b> complementary MOS <b>transistor</b> transfer characteristics than a single N-type biased JFET transistor. The CMOS amplifier resulted in self-compensating gain characteristics over a very wide temperature range from - 55 to + 125 C...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{empirical}} modeling of <b>symmetrical</b> Field-Effect <b>Transistors</b> (FETs). It covers three distinct topics within {{the areas of}} modeling and parameter extraction of microwave FETs. First, the symmetry of FET devices is addressed. Such devices are often used in transceivers as a building block for switches. These devices are intrinsically symmetrical around the gate. Hence, their source and drain terminals are interchangeable. For these devices, the extraction of small signal model parameters is addressed. It is shown that the commonly used small-signal FET model does not translate the intrinsic symmetry of the device into its equivalent circuit. Thus, a big opportunity of {{reducing the number of}} measurement points and the complexity of modeling is overlooked. Therefore, a new small-signal model is proposed to address the intrinsic symmetry present in such devices. Second, the small-signal parameters of the symmetrical model are further improved using a modified optimizer based extraction and a new error expression. This new error function improves the extraction result, and ensures that the symmetry of the device is taken into the account. Finally, the symmetrical small-signal model is extended to find the symmetry in a large-signal model. This leads to the reduction of the intrinsic model so that one current and one charge expression is sufficient to represent its nonlinear behavior. While the modeling procedure is inspired from switch FETs, commonly available devices are symmetrical except for high power transistors. Hence, the modeling procedure which is not limited to switch FETs, can be applied across various device technologies e. g., MOSFET, GaAs pHEMTs/mHEMTs, InP transistors, etc. The applications are also not limited to switches, but include resistive mixers, switch mode oscillators etc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{design of}} a simple, fast and {{accurate}} sample and hold circuit using a switched op-amp configuration is presented. The unique characteristic of this sample and hold circuit is the cancellation of charge injection effects due to the <b>symmetrical</b> output switched <b>transistors</b> circuit and device configuration. The clock-feed through effect is also reduced by applying the effect of clock pulses to {{the sources of the}} main output switched transistors. The circuit is designed using a 2. 6 V supply at a clock frequency of 1 MHz. The output error due to an input signal of 1 V peak to peak at frequencies of 20 KHz and 100 KHz is less than 0. 25 mV and 0. 6 mV respectively. Simulation results of second harmonic distortion using 0. 25 Âµm CMOS technology at input frequencies of 20 KHZ and 100 KHz is 86 dB and 72. 5 dB below the signal level respectively at 1 volt peak to peak input.
