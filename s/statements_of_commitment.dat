40|$|This article {{describes}} {{ways in which}} the equity agenda, as outlined in the Bradley Review of Higher Education (Bradley et al., 2008), is translated into action in one Australian university. Drawing on the conceptual work of Ahmed (2012) to elaborate institutional life, we investigate the effects of the widening participation policy. Ahmed (2012) provokes us to consider institutional commitment as a non-performative in order to examine the association between names and effects as central to institutional cultures. This is achieved through a focus not only on what documents circulating within institutions say but what they do from the perspective of those working with them. The paper draws on three <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> made by various Australian universities in the form of publicly available mission statements and strategic plans to explore how universities value, construct and authenticate their role in widening participation. It then proceeds by supplementing these texts with qualitative data gathered through semi-structured interviews with academic and professional staff in one Australian university to examine how such <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> inform us {{of the extent to which}} they are practised or utilised as demonstrations of action in and of themselves. Drawing on Rizvi and Lingard’s (2011) work on social equity in Australian higher education, we argue that <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to equity and widening participation from universities in the current neoliberal policy assemblage can function to mask the ways in which universities continue to redefine educational values in terms of economics (Rizvi and Lingard, 2011) ...|$|E

40|$|Animal {{welfare is}} the {{well-being}} of animals. The standards of "good " animal welfare vary considerably between different contexts. These standards are under constant review and are debated, created and revised by animal welfare groups, legislators and academics worldwide (Hewson, 2003). It is strongly linked to animal health, which similarly depends on good animal husbandry. Animal welfare is a core mandate of the veterinary community generally and veterinarians individually. This concept is articulated by many veterinary organizations in their Code of Practice, Veterinary Oath or other <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> Such statements centre on the common theme “a veterinarian should be dedicated {{to the benefit of}} society, the conservation of animal resources and the relief of suffering of animals and to promote animal wellbeing”. As scientific knowledge in the field of animal welfare expands and the expectations of society change in regard to animal care, so the commonly accepted definitions of animal welfare have evolved. Knowledge of animal welfare, particularly those in production is becoming essential to veterinary professionals across the globe. In 2008 the World Reference Organization for Animal health (OIE) adopted a definition on animal welfare: “Animal welfare means how an animal is coping with the conditions in which it lives. An animal is in a good state of welfare if (as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well nourished, safe, able to express innate behaviour, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear and distress.

To reach this goal, Bike Host will enable 60 new Canadians with no bicycle access to become regular commuting cyclists who are willing to invest in the purchase of their own bicycles. Along the way, Bike Host will provide social support and community resources to help participants establish a network of knowledgeable cyclists who are able to offer advice on topics such as bicycle repair, theft prevention, and road safety. The success of the 2014 Bike Host program will be measured by survey materials that are developed by the Toronto Think and Do Tank, and the participant responses will be analyzed by research assistants at the University of Toronto, organized by myself as Research Manager under the direction of Dr. Beth Savan. Community-based social marketing has been instrumental in detailing the specific processes and tools that leverage social environments to foster sustainable behaviours relating to individual energy-use and waste diversion, but these principles have only begun to be employed to alter the much more complicated behaviours that affect our transportation habits. 11, 12 The Bike Host research project builds on our previous work promoting behaviour change and bicycle use to new immigrants and secondary school-aged children, and tailors this approach directly to local populations in St. Jamestown and Regent Park. These communities host large cohorts of new Canadians, who have recently changed their lives through immigrating.

40|$|Background: North-South Partnership (NSP) is a main {{strategy}} for health promotion work in Africa. Northern partners contribute funding and expertise and Southern partners contribute crucial knowledge of context and capacity for local action. This model is widely promoted within health promotion documents but actual practice {{is not well}} understood. In addition to being largely anecdotal, the literature on NSP {{is limited by the}} tendency to draw overly pessimistic conclusions, by comparing idealistic definitions of partnership to real-world examples. There is a failure in the literature to systematically examine NSP by criteria of partnership functioning generally. The few case studies that do exist focus primarily on power relations, characterizing NSP as one-way streets of accountability where Northern partners dictate the agenda and issue demands. As Southern organizations engage in NSP, those that are successful grow as a result. Some authors suggest that this process of scaling up can draw the organization’s focus toward global advocacy and professionalization, and away from their community empowerment work. However, these assumptions are mere speculation without case studies specifically examining these processes in practice. Another complicated interaction within NSP is the empowerment of and relationship to the local Southern community, often an important motivator for Northern partners to engage with Southern partners. Voluntary community members in these grassroots organizations represent tremendous partner resources, however, their motivations, roles and the impact of context on volunteer work is not sufficiently explored in the existing literature. Objective: The study used a systems model, the Bergen Model of Collaborative Functioning, to map NSP processes over the 18 -year history of a Southern organization’s partnerships with Northern organizations, through scaling-up processes and interacting with grassroots volunteers. Design: A case study design was used. The case was purposely selected because of its reputation of success over many years of operation within many longstanding NSPs. The case, KIWAKKUKI, is a women’s grassroots organization working on issues of HIV and AIDS in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. Documents, observations and, primarily, interview data were collected. Data collection occurred during two field visits in 2008 and 2009. Document data included formal reports, internal forms and records and email exchanges with Northern partners. Observational data was collected during both field trips and field logs were kept. In the first round of interviews in 2008, nine participants were interviewed. An additional 12 interviews were conducted in 2009, nine of which were new participants while three participants were interviewed a second time. The interviews were open-ended and lasted an average of one hour. The Bergen Model of Collaborative Functioning was employed to analyze the data. Themes were identified and coded using an iterative process several times during the research. An established framework for scaling up was also used to examine the experience of growth of KIWAKKUKI. Findings: Mapping KIWAKKUKI’s NSP experience demonstrated that even in effective partnerships, both positive and negative processes are present. It was also observed that KIWAKKUKI’s partnership breakdowns were not strictly negative, as they provided lessons that facilitated learning and improved future partnership work. KIWAKKUKI, a successful, experienced Southern organization with a grassroots base of over 6000 volunteers described a give and take of power in their NSP relationships. The success and synergy KIWAKKUKI experienced through its NSPs led to rapid growth in both its partnerships and grassroots base. The grassroots growth necessitated an increase in volunteer capacity-building that overextended the available funds for those activities. The result was that new volunteers were not trained as thoroughly as veteran volunteers and participants believed services suffered as a result. Northern partners’ mission was identified as being the key factor in determining if they would fund capacity building for grassroots volunteers. Examination of KIWAKKUKI’s relationship with grassroots volunteers tdemonstrated that the volunteers’ knowledge of local people and conditions was crucial to successful functioning within the organization. Volunteers were motivated by their desire to learn to care for family members, to reverse stigma, and to work with other women. Volunteers’ engagement was enhanced not just by work-related activities, but also by welcoming and supportive activities (sharing stories and singing together, for example). Volunteers were affected by their experience: positively, through empowerment, improving skills, and by community recognition; and negatively, by burnout, conferred stigma and in extreme cases, domestic violence. The Tanzanian context powerfully affected how and why volunteers engaged with KIWAKKUKI. Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of acknowledging and reporting on both positive and negative processes to maximise learning in North-South partnerships. This is demonstrated by the new insights illuminated by this research that too much synergy can be bad (growth outpacing capacity-building) and that antagony, or negative processes, can be good by facilitating opportunities to learn from mistakes. The need for capacity-building for volunteers is crucial and would benefit from clear <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and an agreed mission within individual NSPs to support, empower and train the volunteer base, as much of the value of NSPs is derived from this community contribution. Strengthening the grassroots base not only improves the services and the cultural appropriateness of health promotion work, the findings also indicate that Southern organizations strongly founded on a large grassroots volunteer base (partner resources) can balance the power afforded to Northern partners with their large financial contributions (financial resources). </p...|$|E
