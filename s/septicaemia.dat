In the novel, Jenny Richards survives, whereas her counterpart in the 2008 series, Jenny Collins, does not; this means that Greg Preston and Jenny cannot have a child as the years unfold. Abby Grant still falls in love with Jimmy Garland; however, in the book, he eventually dies from <b>septicaemia.</b>|$|E

He was discovered by his mother, who was not aware of his dependence on heroin. She contacted his wife Caroline, who knew about it and immediately identified the problem as serious. After Caroline drove him to a drug clinic at Clouds House in East Knoyle, near Warminster, he was taken to Salisbury Infirmary where he was diagnosed as suffering from <b>septicaemia.</b> Although he regained consciousness enough to speak to his mother, his condition worsened by the start of the new year and he was put on a respirator.

50|$|Co-trimoxazole was {{claimed to}} be more {{effective}} than either of its components individually in treating bacterial infections, although this was later disputed. Because it has a higher incidence of adverse effects, including allergic responses, its use has been restricted in many countries to very specific circumstances where its improved efficacy has been demonstrated. It may be effective in a variety of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, renal and urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal tract infections, skin and wound infections, <b>septicaemias,</b> and other infections caused by sensitive organisms. Co-trimoxazole in retinochoroiditis shows a reduction in the risk of recurrent retinochoroiditis. The global problem of advancing antimicrobial resistance has led to a renewed interest in the use of co-trimoxazole more recently.|$|R

40|$|Antibodies against {{single-stranded}} DNA (ssDNA) {{were followed}} by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in weekly serum samples of 39 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 11 with acute lymphatic leukaemia (ALL) and 26 with other haematological malignancies. Their frequency and mean level during the entire follow-up were higher than in sera of healthy blood donors. Patients with AML had the highest levels and prevalence of anti-ssDNA antibodies, i. e. overall frequencies of IgG class antibodies in patients with AML, ALL and other haematological malignancies were 97 %, 82 % and 58 %, respectively. Antibodies of IgM class were less frequently found. Prevalence and levels of anti-ssDNA antibodies were already at least as high in newly diagnosed malignancies as later {{during the course of}} the disease.

A teicoplanin and ceftriaxone combination was assessed for use as empirical therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic children with acute leukaemias. Of 47 patients, fever was of unknown origin in 21, and documented in 26 with 28 strains isolated; 19 Gram-positive (all sensitive to teicoplanin) and nine Gram-negative. Within 48 h, 41 patients became afebrile and the pathogen was cleared if initially present. Mean duration of treatment was 16 days. Febrile relapse occurred in 24 patients with eight documented superinfections.

25|$|Semmelweis {{was outraged}} by the {{indifference}} of the medical profession and began writing open and increasingly angry letters to prominent European obstetricians, at times denouncing them as irresponsible murderers. His contemporaries, including his wife, believed he was losing his mind, and in 1865, nearly twenty years after his breakthrough, he was committed to an asylum. He died there of <b>septicaemia</b> only 14 days later, possibly {{as the result of}} being severely beaten by guards. Semmelweis's practice earned widespread acceptance only years after his death, when Louis Pasteur developed the germ theory of disease, offering a theoretical explanation for Semmelweis's findings. He is considered a pioneer of antiseptic procedures.|$|E
40|$|Melioidosis, {{which is}} {{infection}} with the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, {{is an important}} cause of sepsis in east Asia and northern Australia. In northeastern Thailand, melioidosis accounts for 20 % of all community-acquired <b>septicaemias,</b> and causes death in 40 % of treated patients. B pseudomallei is an environmental saprophyte found in wet soils. It mostly infects adults with an underlying predisposing condition, mainly diabetes mellitus. Melioidosis is characterised by formation of abscesses, especially in the lungs, liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, and prostate. In a third of paediatric cases in southeast Asia, the disease presents as parotid abscess. In northern Australia, 4 % of patients present with brain stem encephalitis. Ceftazidime is the treatment of choice for severe melioidosis, but response to high dose parenteral treatment is slow (median time to abatement of fever 9 days). Maintenance antibiotic treatment is with a four-drug regimen of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or with amoxicillin-clavulanate in children and pregnant women. However, even with 20 weeks' antibiotic treatment, 10 % of patients relapse. With improvements {{in health care and}} diagnostic microbiology in endemic areas of Asia, and increased travel, melioidosis will probably be recognised increasingly during the next decade...|$|R
40|$|Burkholderia mallei, the {{aetiologic}} {{agent of}} glanders, causes {{a variety of}} illnesses in animals and humans ranging from occult infections to acute fulminating <b>septicaemias.</b> To better understand the role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the pathogenesis of these diseases, studies were initiated to characterize the structural and biological properties of lipid A moieties expressed by this organism. Using a combination of chemical analyses and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, B. mallei was shown to express a heterogeneous mixture of tetra- and penta-acylated lipid A species that were non-stoichiometrically substituted with 4 -amino- 4 -deoxy-arabinose residues. The major penta-acylated species consisted of bisphosphorylated d-glucosamine disaccharide backbones possessing two amide linked 3 -hydroxyhexadecanoic acids, two ester linked 3 -hydroxytetradecanoic acids [C 14 : 0 (3 -OH) ] and an acyloxyacyl linked tetradecanoic acid, whereas, the major tetra-acylated species possessed all but the 3 ′-linked C 14 : 0 (3 -OH) residues. In addition, although devoid of hexa-acylated species, B. mallei LPS was {{shown to be a}} potent activator of human Toll-like receptor 4 complexes and stimulated human macrophage-like cells (THP- 1 and U- 937), monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells to produce high levels of TNF-α, IL- 6 and RANTES. Based upon these results, it appears that B. mallei LPS is likely to {{play a significant role in}} the pathogenesis of human disease...|$|R
40|$|Burkholderia pseudomallei is a {{recognized}} biothreat agent and the causative agent of melioidosis. This Gram-negative bacterium exists as a soil saprophyte in melioidosis-endemic {{areas of the}} world and accounts for 20 % of community-acquired <b>septicaemias</b> in northeastern Thailand where half of those affected die. Here we report the complete genome of B. pseudomallei, which is composed of two chromosomes of 4. 07 megabase pairs and 3. 17 megabase pairs, showing significant functional partitioning of genes between them. The large chromosome encodes many of the core functions associated with central metabolism and cell growth, whereas the small chromosome carries more accessory functions associated with adaptation and survival in different niches. Genomic comparisons with closely and more distantly related bacteria revealed a greater level of gene order conservation and a greater number of orthologous genes on the large chromosome, suggesting that the two replicons have distinct evolutionary origins. A striking feature of the genome was the presence of 16 genomic islands (GIs) that together made up 6. 1 % of the genome. Further analysis revealed these islands to be variably present in a collection of invasive and soil isolates but entirely absent from the clonally related organism B. mallei. We propose that variable horizontal gene acquisition by B. pseudomallei is an important feature of recent genetic evolution and that this has resulted in a genetically diverse pathogenic species.

40|$|Pregnancy and {{delivery}} of 27 women with prenatal infection of the fetus, neonatal period of the babies with prenatal pneumonia, health status of up to 2 children were researched in retrospect. Women with inflammation of the genitals (78, 6 %) and extragenital pathology of the inflammatory genesis (36, 3 %) had prenatal infection of the fetus. In the early neonatal period every baby had cerebral ischemia, every third child had haemorrhages in different cerebral structures. All babies have been transferred to children&# 039;s hospital for treatment where the rehabilitation was carried out during 1 - 2, 5 months. Infantile cerebral paralysis, hydrocephaly, epilepsy, epileptoid attacks were detected in 8 babies on {{the first year of}} life (29, 6 %). 5 babies (18, 5 %) had atrophy of discs of optic nerves, retinal angiopathy.

40|$|The work {{carried on}} {{under the auspices}} of the Medical Commission for the Investigation of Acute Respiratory Diseases, at the Bacteriological Laboratory of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, has {{consisted}} principally of a comparative study of the morphology, growth characters, fermentative activities, and agglutination reactions of pneumococci and allied organisms isolated by ourselves and the various workers under the Commission. These organisms were from two chief sources: (a) from the mouth and naso-pharynx of supposedly normal persons and persons suffering from minor inflammations of the naso-pharynx, and (b) from definitely pathologic sources, such as pneumonic sputum, pneumonic lungs, empyæma, the circulating blood of pneumonia patients, <b>septicaemias,</b> meningitis, and various minor lesions, usually due to infection with pneumococci. One of the principal objects of the study was to make a careful comparison, in the light of the most recent knowledge of the biology of the pneumococcus and by the aid of the latest biological and technical methods, of the series of organisms from these two sources, and thus to determine definitely the true nature of pneumococcus-like organisms occurring in the mouths of normal persons. The second and equally important object, ultimately dependent, however, upon the solution of the first, was the determination of the frequency of occurrence of typical pneumococci in the mouths of healthy individuals. The investigations detailed in the present paper have dealt chiefly with the first problem and incidentally with the second, and lead to the following conclusions: (a) That organisms, not to be distinguished by morphological characters or by any physiological peculiarities from true pneumococci derived from pathologic sources, occur with frequency in the mouths of healthy persons and those suffering from slight inflammations of the naso pharynx, and that the only permissible and legitimate conclusion is that these organisms are true pneumococci. (b) That there are other organisms in normal mouths and from pathologic sources that morphologically or by staining reactions are not definitely to be distinguished from pneumococci, and can only be recognized by a careful study of their fermentative activities and agglutination reactions. These organisms are non-inulin fermenters. (c) That the organism known as Streptococcus mucosus is at times found in cultivations from the mouths of apparently healthy individuals, and that, although it shows certain peculiarities distinguishing it from the typical pneumococcus, it is probably very closely related to, and a variety of, this species...|$|R
40|$|Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne {{zoonotic}} disease {{caused by a}} virus of the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus. It is responsible for extensive outbreaks of disease in livestock in Africa with significant mortality and economic impact. Virus neutralization is considered {{the gold standard for}} confirming Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection but the procedure is time consuming and expensive. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), histopathology, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) are the diagnostic methods most often used in South Africa to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of RVF in necropsied animals. Validated estimates of diagnostic accuracy of these tests, in naturally infected livestock, however, have not been published. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of rRT-PCR, histopathology, and IHC using Bayesian latent class methods in the absence of a gold standard. A secondary objective was to estimate stratum-specific values based on species, age, degree of specimen autolysis, and the presence/absence of tissue pigments. The Sensitivity (Se) and Specificity (Sp) of qRT-PCR were 97. 4 % (95 % credibility interval (CI) : 95. 2 % - 98. 8 %) and 71. 7 % (95 % CI: 65 % - 77. 9 %) respectively. The extraordinary analytical sensitivity of PCR makes this test very susceptible to false positive reactions, and thus reduced specificity. This is more likely during large-scale epidemics due to crosscontamination of specimens at necropsy facilities or testing laboratories. The Se and Sp of histopathology were 94. 6 % (95 % CI: 91 % - 97. 2 %) and 92. 3 % (95 % CI: 87. 6 % - 95. 8 %) respectively. Single cases of RVF could be confused with acute poisoning with plants, bacterial <b>septicaemias,</b> and viral diseases such as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and Wesselsbron disease. Most of these conditions, however, can be excluded using histological examination of the liver, special stains, bacterial culture, and toxicological or serological investigations. The Se and Sp of IHC were 97. 6 % (95 % CI: 93. 9 % - 99. 8 %) and 99. 4 % (95 % CI: 96. 9 % - 100 %) respectively. Immunohistochemistry is highly specific because characteristic positive immunolabelling of the cytoplasm of hepatocytes can be correlated with the presence of hepatocellular injury typical for RVFV infection. False negative results are sometimes obtained with IHC because of reader error or loss of the antigenic epitopes due to advanced autolysis. Scant positive immunolabelling might be missed or viral proteins might be absent from sections of liver with advanced hepatocellular damage. The stratified analysis suggested differences in test accuracy in foetuses and severely autolysed specimens. The Sp of histopathology in foetuses (83. 0 %) was 9. 3 % lower than the value obtained for the sample population (92. 3 %). Lesions in some foetuses are more subtle and the typical eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions are often difficult to detect. In severely autolysed specimens, the Se of IHC decreased by 16. 1 % and the Sp of rRT-PCR by 17. 4 %. There is no plausible biological explanation for this decrease in the Sp of rRTPCR since the RNA of RVFV is resistant to degradation in autolysed tissues. Conversely, the antibody used to detect RVFV using IHC detects epitopes raised against nucleoproteins of the virus and it is possible that viral proteins become too widely dispersed and/or degraded in autolysed tissues to detect by light microscopy. It is possible that the marked decrease in Se of histopathology and IHC in severely autolysed specimens caused an apparent decrease in Sp of rRT-PCR, due to the latent class method. In conclusion, the high estimated Sp (99. 4 %) of IHC and the low Sp of rRT-PCR (71. 3 %) suggests that the definitive diagnosis or exclusion of RVF should not rely on a single PCR test and that IHC would be an effective confirmatory test for rRT-PCR positive field cases necropsied during an epidemic. Immunohistochemistry results from severely autolysed specimens, however, should be interpreted with caution and aborted foetuses in areas endemic for RVF should be screened using a variety of tests. The diagnostic Se and Sp of histopathology was much higher than expected confirming the value of routine post mortem examinations and histopathology of liver specimens. The most feasible RVF testing option in areas that do not have suitably equipped PCR laboratories, and where disease is often not detected in livestock until after human cases have been diagnosed, would be routine histopathology screening with IHC confirmation.
