25|$|The {{environmental}} group Riverkeeper {{took note of}} the long-overdue renewal of the plant's discharge permit from the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). In common with Roseton and Indian Point Energy Center, its use of once-through cooling, in which river water was pumped in, used to cool the plant, then pumped out warm, dated to the 1950s and was responsible for large fish kills in the river. A state judge had voided the permit, but it was reversed on appeal. After DEC rebuffed Riverkeeper's effort to force it to accelerate the process, and ruled that closed-cycle cooling, the {{environmental group}}'s preferred alternative, was not feasible at Danskammer, Riverkeeper filed suit against DEC and Dynegy alleging violations of state administrative-procedure law in issuing the new permit. They alleged that DEC had accepted Dynegy's argument that it didn't have space to install closed-cycle cooling despite the company owning large tracts of adjacent vacant land, {{and that it had}} allowed Dynegy to account for its water withdrawals in an unrealistic fashion. Dynegy <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> cheaper alternatives to the cooling towers a closed-cycle system would require.|$|E
25|$|Whether or {{not this}} or indeed any so called 'super-dairy' is ever built, this {{controversy}} {{is likely to have}} a lasting impact on Britain's future dairy policy. Supporters claim large scale farming offers opportunities to meet food security and climate change challenges of the future. Research by opponents counter this hypothesis with an argument that the economics of the system are unsustainable in a report titled: ''; however, the figures used in this report have also been heavily criticised by the industry's leading providers of economics data DairyCo, part of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, saying that the different systems are not being compared on a like for like basis and are ‘astonishingly naïve’. However, there are concerns that any similar proposal, if successful, would set a precedent for the development of large-scale farming systems more commonly associated with the US where such units are known as CAFOs - although with the definition of a dairy CAFO being over 750 cows, , the dairy industry's levy and advisory body, <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> already at least 12 such farms operating successfully and without issues - as proven by the lack of media interest in these farms - in England.|$|E
25|$|The French army {{arrives at}} the {{barricade}} and demands that the students surrender ("At the Barricade—Upon These Stones"). Though Javert tells the students {{that the government will}} not attack that night ("Javert's Arrival"), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert ("Little People"). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that all the people of Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. Éponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms ("A Little Fall of Rain"). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over Éponine's death. Valjean {{arrives at the}} barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier ("Night of Anguish"), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels are suspicious of him at first, but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras {{to be the one to}} execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he will not give up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no conditions to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty. ("The First Attack").|$|E

[...] On occasion, Pennant's knowledge could be highly specific: for [...] "The Great-Crested Grebe", Bewick records that the nest [...] "is made of various kinds of dried fibres, stalks and leaves of water plants, and (Pennant says) of the roots of bugbane, stalks of water-lily, pond-weed and water-violet; when it happens to be blown from among the reeds, it floats about upon the surface of the water".|$|E
