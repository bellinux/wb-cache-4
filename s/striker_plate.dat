50|$|P-wave {{refraction}} {{evaluates the}} compression wave {{generated by the}} seismic source located at a known distance from the array. The wave is generated by vertically striking a <b>striker</b> <b>plate</b> with a sledgehammer, shooting a seismic shotgun into the ground, or detonating an explosive charge in the ground. Since the compression wave is the fastest of the seismic waves, it is {{sometimes referred to as}} the primary wave and is usually more-readily identifiable within the seismic recording as compared to the other seismic waves.|$|E

The Schlage Lock Company was incorporated with a starting capital of $30. In the same year, {{he applied for}} a patent for a lock that could be drilled into a door with only two holes. This new cylindrical lock had a single plate, serving as both escutcheon and <b>striker</b> <b>plate,</b> wrapping around the door's edge. It was mostly used on interior doors, where it replaced the older Mortise lock.|$|E

50|$|A snaphance or snaphaunce {{is a type}} of lock for {{firing a}} gun or is a gun using that {{mechanism}}. The name is Dutch in origin but the mechanism can not be attributed to the Netherlands with certainty. It is the mechanical progression of the wheellock firing mechanism, and along with the miquelet lock and doglock are predecessors of the flintlock mechanism. It fires from a flint struck against a <b>striker</b> <b>plate</b> above a steel pan to ignite the priming powder which fires the gun. Examples of this firearm can be found through Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.|$|E

40|$|An {{advanced}} {{docking system}} is undergoing development to enable softer, safer docking than was possible when using prior docking systems. This system {{is intended for}} original use in docking of visiting spacecraft and berthing the Crew Return Vehicle at the International Space Station (ISS). The system could also be adapted {{to a variety of}} other uses in outer space and on Earth, including mating submersible vehicles, assembling structures, and robotic berthing/handling of payloads and cargo. Heretofore, two large spacecraft have been docked by causing the spacecraft to approach each other at a speed sufficient to activate capture latches - a procedure that results in large docking loads and is made more difficult because of the speed. The basic design and mode of operation of the present advanced docking system would eliminate the need to rely on speed of approach to activate capture latches, thereby making it possible to reduce approach speed and thus docking loads substantially. The system would comprise an active subsystem on one spacecraft and a passive subsystem on another spacecraft with which the active subsystem will be docked. The passive subsystem would include an extensible ring containing magnetic <b>striker</b> <b>plates</b> and guide petals. The active subsystem would include mating guide petals and electromagnets containing limit switches and would be arranged to mate with the magnetic <b>striker</b> <b>plates</b> and guide petals of the passive assembly. The electromagnets would be carried on (but not rigidly attached to) a structural ring that would be instrumented with load sensors. The outputs of the sensors would be sent, along with position information, as feedback to an electronic control subsystem. The system would also include electromechanical actuators that would extend or retract the ring upon command by the control subsystem...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe multiaxial {{impact test}} in {{polymers}} is analyzed. The impact response of a propylene copolymer is characterized under different test conditions. Due {{to the nature}} of the impact event and to the complex material behavior, an intricate stress state is developed rendering rather difficult the assessment of the intrinsic impact properties. Furthermore, processing determine polymer microstructure, which significantly influences the impact response. The multiaxial impact test was simulated using a finite element code. The computed force-displacement curves fall in between the computed ones with two extreme contact conditions between <b>striker</b> and <b>plate.</b> Friction plays an important role from medium strain levels until the peak force is reached, determining its intensity. The constitutive coefficients at high strain-rates were identified by an inverse method. The adopted constitutive model allows the computation of the force-deflection curve until the force peak, but not its full description. For that, a modified version was used that more correctly takes into account the strain hardening of the polymer. Finally, it is emphasized the importance of the knowledge of the heat conversion factor for realistically predicting the mechanical behavior of polymers at high strain-rates...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} and analyzes the behaviour of TRIP 1000 steel sheets subjected to low velocity perforation by conical projectiles. The relevance {{of this material}} resides in the potential transformation of retained austenite to martensite during impact loading. This process leads {{to an increase in}} strength and ductility of the material. However, this transformation takes place only under certain loading conditions strongly dependent on the initial temperature and deformation rate. In order to study the material behaviour under impact loading, perforation tests have been performed using a drop weight tower. Experiments were carried out at two different initial temperatures T 0 213 K and T 0 288 K, and within the range of impact velocities 2. 5 m/s 6 V 0 6 4. 5 m/s. The experimental setup enabled the measuring of impact velocity, residual velocity, load time history and failure mode. In addition, dry and lubricated contacts between the <b>striker</b> and the <b>plate</b> have been investigated. Finally, by using X ray diffraction {{it has been shown that}} no martensitic transformation takes place during the perforation process. The causes involving the none appearance of martensite are examined...|$|R
