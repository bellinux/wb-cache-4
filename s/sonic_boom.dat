5|$|Amy Rose is {{also one}} of the five main {{characters}} in the CGI series <b>Sonic</b> <b>Boom,</b> along with Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and the new character Sticks, the latter of whom she is best friends with. Her personality has been changed into a stronger, more independent role, being a natural-born leader and the backbone of the team. Her romantic feelings towards Sonic are kept intact, with a notable change being that she actively keeps her crush on him a secret, even from Sonic himself.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{debuted in}} the Sonic the Hedgehog manga series created by Kenji Terada in 1992. Her first video-game {{appearance}} was in 1993's Sonic CD {{and she was}} first playable in 1994's Sonic Drift. Amy {{has become one of}} the series' most popular and recognizable characters, appearing in dozens of main-series and spinoff titles, several comic book series, the anime Sonic X, and the computer-animated <b>Sonic</b> <b>Boom.</b> She has received an average response from critics. Although some found her cute and powerful, others criticized her for her voice acting and personality. She has frequently appeared in Sonic merchandise.|$|E

5|$|On 1 June 1956, a {{production}} Victor XA917 flown by test pilot Johnny Allam inadvertently exceeded {{the speed of}} sound after Allam let the nose drop slightly at a high power setting. Allam noticed a cockpit indication of Mach 1.1 and ground observers from Watford to Banbury reported hearing a <b>sonic</b> <b>boom.</b> The Victor maintained stability throughout the event. Aviation author Andrew Brookes has claimed that Allam broke the sound barrier knowingly to demonstrate the Victor's superiority to the earlier V-bombers. The Victor was the largest aircraft to have broken the sound barrier at that time.|$|E
5|$|While Concorde had {{initially}} held {{a great deal}} of customer interest, the project was hit by a large number of order cancellations. The Paris Le Bourget air show crash of the competing Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 had shocked potential buyers, and public concern over the environmental issues presented by a supersonic aircraft– the <b>sonic</b> <b>boom,</b> take-off noise and pollution– had produced a shift in public opinion of SSTs. By 1976 four nations remained as prospective buyers: Britain, France, China, and Iran. Only Air France and British Airways (the successor to BOAC) took up their orders, with the two governments taking a cut of any profits made.|$|E
5|$|During the Mexican oil boom, Air France flew Concorde twice weekly to Mexico City's Benito Juárez International Airport via Washington, DC, or New York City, from September 1978 to November 1982. The {{worldwide}} {{economic crisis}} {{during that period}} resulted in this route's cancellation; the last flights were almost empty. The routing between Washington or New York and Mexico City included a deceleration, from Mach 2.02 to Mach 0.95, to cross Florida subsonically and avoid creating a <b>sonic</b> <b>boom</b> over the state; Concorde then re-accelerated back to high speed while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 April 1989, on an around-the-world luxury tour charter, British Airways implemented changes to this routing that allowed G-BOAF to maintain Mach 2.02 by passing around Florida {{to the east and}} south. Periodically Concorde visited the region on similar chartered flights to Mexico City and Acapulco.|$|E

The first case, referred to as acceleration superbooms, is related to the enhanced <b>sonic</b> <b>booms</b> generated during the acceleration maneuvers of supersonic aircrafts.

In 1967, the Phantom supported a brief military-inspired program to determine whether an airplane's <b>sonic</b> <b>boom</b> could be directed and whether {{it could be used}} as a weapon of sorts, or at least an annoyance.

40|$|An {{important}} issue for shaped minimized <b>sonic</b> <b>booms</b> is whether turbulence-induced distortions will adversely affect the benefits gained by shaping. This question was considerably simplified by two recent results. The {{first is the}} finding that the loudness of <b>sonic</b> <b>booms</b> is well quantified by loudness. The second is that loudness of a shaped boom is dominated by the shock waves. The issue is now the effect of turbulence on weak (1 psf or less) <b>sonic</b> <b>booms.</b> Since it is clear that molecular relaxation effects {{have a significant effect on}} shock structure and loudness, turbulence effects must be examined in conjunction with relaxation-thickened shocks. This analysis must be directed toward loudness calculations and include all pertinent mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's High Speed Project is {{developing}} a predictive capability for annoyance caused by shaped <b>sonic</b> <b>booms</b> transmitted indoors. The predictive capability is intended for use by aircraft designers {{as well as by}} aircraft noise regulators who are considering lifting the current prohibition on overland civil supersonic flight. The goal of the current study is to use an indoor simulator to validate two models developed using headphone tests for annoyance caused by <b>sonic</b> <b>booms</b> with and without rattle augmentation. The predictors in the proposed models include Moore and Glasberg's Stationary Loudness Level, the time derivative of Moore and Glasberg's time-varying short-term Loudness Level, and the difference between two weighted sound exposure levels, CSEL-ASEL. The indoor simulator provides a more realistic listening environment than headphones due to lowfrequency sound reproduction down to 6 Hz, which also causes perceptible tactile vibration. The results of this study show that a model consisting of {PL + (CSEL-ASEL) } is a reliable predictor of annoyance caused by shaped <b>sonic</b> <b>booms</b> alone, rattle sounds alone, and shaped <b>sonic</b> <b>booms</b> and rattle sounds together...|$|R
