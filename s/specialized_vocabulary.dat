The Urdu variant of Hindustani received recognition and patronage under British rule when the British replaced the local official languages with English and Hindustani written in Nastaʿlīq script, {{as the official}} language in North and Northwestern India. Religious, social, and political factors pushed for a distinction between Urdu and Hindi in India, leading to the Hindi–Urdu controversy.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Garner {{became the}} editor in chief of Black's Law Dictionary, whose roots are {{traceable}} to 1891 and which is currently the most widely respected authority on Anglo-American legal lexicography. Since 1995, Garner has overhauled the book over the course of four unabridged editions (7th–10th). He created a panel of international legal experts to improve all the <b>specialized</b> <b>vocabulary</b> in the book, including Roman law, international law, and transactional terminology. With the help of these experts, Garner and his team have rewritten the entire dictionary and added tens of thousands of new entries, amplifying many with dates of linguistic origin; supplementary usage, historical, or other lexicographic information; and exemplary quotations drawn from myriad sources in the literature on Anglo-American law—some as early as the 16th century.|$|E

25|$|Owing to {{interaction}} with other languages, Urdu has become localized {{wherever it is}} spoken, including in Pakistan. Urdu in Pakistan has undergone changes and has incorporated and borrowed many words from regional languages like Pashto, Punjabi, Sindhi and Balti, thus allowing speakers of the language in Pakistan to distinguish themselves more easily and giving the language a decidedly Pakistani flavour. Similarly, the Urdu spoken in India can also be distinguished into many dialects like Dakhni (Deccan) of South India, and Khariboli of the Punjab region. Because of Urdu's similarity to Hindi, speakers of the two languages can easily understand one another if both sides refrain from using <b>specialized</b> <b>vocabulary.</b> The syntax (grammar), morphology, and the core vocabulary are essentially identical. Thus linguists usually count them as one single language and contend that they are considered as two different languages for socio-political reasons.|$|E

40|$|William Langland's The Vision of Piers Plowman was {{probably}} the first medieval English poem to achieve a national audience because Langland chose to write in the vernacular and he used the <b>specialized</b> <b>vocabularies</b> of his readership to open the poem to them. During the late thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, writers began using the vernacular {{in an attempt to}} allow all English people access to their texts. They did so consciously, indicating their intent in prologues and envois when they formally address readers. Some writers, like Langland and the author of Mankind, actually use representatives of the rural classes as primary characters who exhibit the beliefs and lives of the rural population. Anne Middleton's distinction between public-the readership an author imagined-and audience-the readership a work achieved-allows modern critics to discuss both public and audience and try to determine how the two differed. While the public is always only a presumption, the language in which an author writes and the cultural events depicted by the literature can provide a more plausible estimate of the public. The vernacular allowed authors like Gower, Chaucer, the author of Mankind, and Langland to use the <b>specialized</b> <b>vocabularies</b> of the legal and rural communities to discuss societal problems. They also use representatives of the communities to further open the texts to a vernacular public. These open texts provide some representation for the rural and common people's ideas about the other classes to be heard. Langland in particular uses the <b>specialized</b> <b>vocabularies</b> and representative characters to establish both the faults of all English people and a common guide they can follow to seek moral lives through Truth. His rural character, Piers the Plowman, allows rural readers to identify with the messages in the text while showing upper class and educated readers that they too can emulate a rural character who sets a moral standard...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Exploratory search over a {{collection}} often requires users to iteratively apply {{a variety of}} strategies, such as searching for more general or more specific concepts {{in reaction to the}} information they encounter. Rich semantic models, such as WordNet, are potentially valuable aids for users to make sense of this information. However, these large complex models often contain <b>specialized</b> <b>vocabularies</b> and a detailed level of granularity that makes them difficult to use as an aid for opportunistic search. In this paper, we describe how Semantic Fisheye Views (SFEV) can be designed to transparently integrate rich semantic models into the search process, allowing users to effectively explore a diverse range of related concepts without explicitly navigating over the underlying model. The SFEV combines semantic guided search with interactive visualization techniques, creating a search tool that we have found to be significantly more effective than keyword similarity alone for exploratory tasks. ...|$|R

40|$|Biomedical texts pose an {{interesting}} challenge in {{natural language processing}} tasks. While {{the information contained in}} them is important to people of all backgrounds, often they are stylistically complex with <b>specialized</b> <b>vocabularies,</b> and require advanced degrees or other special training to interpret correctly. Because of this, researchers in Natural Language Processing are often at a disadvantage when it comes to extracting task-specific information from these texts: the experts who are best able to understand them may not have the time or interest in completing complicated and time-consuming annotations for use in corpus analysis and machine learning. This paper proposes a methodology for creating light annotation tasks for biomedical corpora {{that can be used to}} create useful annotations without requiring extensive training or exceptionally long annotation periods. The utility of the proposed methodology is examined in light of existing annotation projects, as well as through the lens of a case study using hospital discharge summaries for patient selection based on eligibility criteria...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{proposal}} to apply models developed within the Explanatory and Combinatorial Lexicology (ECL) Framework to the analysis and description of <b>specialized</b> <b>vocabularies.</b> I will first review previous attempts in the area, and show that they have led to interesting findings. I will then proceed to demonstrate, using terminological units extracted from different types of specialized corpora (namely computing, retailing, and law), that various components of ECL {{can be used to}} identify and describe specialized senses. First, criteria help make subtle semantic discriminations between related senses. Secondly, the actant structure of predicative units can be identified accurately and actant instantiated using semantic labels. Thirdly, lexical functions capture various semantic relations (paradigmatic and syntagmatic) between terms. Finally, I will demonstrate that minor adaptations can be made to the ECL models to accommodate special features of specialized terms (e. g. the definition of classes in the description of actant structures; meronymic lexical functions). ...|$|R

We report on an experiment with a moderatesize corpus of patient discharge summaries collected during the MENELAS project, taking as categories the high-level axes of the SNOMED nomenclature, and processing the corpus with the ZELLIG suite of tools.

50|$|Technobabble (a {{portmanteau}} {{of technology}} and babble), also called technospeak, {{is a form of}} jargon that uses buzzwords, esoteric language, specialized technical terms, or technical slang that is incomprehensible to the listener. Various fields of practice and industry have their own <b>specialized</b> <b>vocabularies,</b> or jargon, that allow those educated within that industry to concisely convey ideas that may be confusing, misleading, or nonsensical to an outside listener. The difference between technobabble and jargon lies with the intent of the user and the audience: a dishonest person might use overly technical (and often meaningless) language to overwhelm and confuse the audience, masking their dishonesty, while a fiction writer might use it to cover plot holes or to invoke suspension of disbelief of story elements that defy current understandings of science and technology. Use of jargon within technical circles and with no intent to obfuscate is not usually included in the definition of technobabble.|$|R
