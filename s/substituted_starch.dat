40|$|Xanthate esters of {{cellulose}} {{have great importance}} for the cellophane and viscose rayon industries. Routine chemical analyses tell nothing {{of the way the}} xanthate groups are distributed along the cellulose molecule, or among the three different kinds of hydroxyl groups in the glucose residues. Information of this kind is needed before the process of "ripening" of viscose can be understood in detail, or the physical properties of rayon or cellophane correlated with those of the viscose from which they are derived. Owing to the instability {{of cellulose}} sodium xanthate, most of the chemical methods of carbohydrate chemistry are inadmissible. Hence the sodium xanthate is converted to a more stable ester. If then all the remaining free hydroxyl groups are "blocked" and xanthate ester groups are subsequently removed, the regenerated hydroxyl groups are attached to carbon atoms Which were previously substituted with xanthate groups. Attempts by numerous workers to remove all of the xanthate sulfur from fully <b>substituted</b> <b>starch</b> or cellulose xanthate esters consistently failed to remove a small percentage. Moreover, dexanthation was invariably accompanied by removal of {{a small percentage of the}} other "blocking" substituents. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of short-dough biscuits of various composition were determined in three-point bending tests. In general, reduction of fat content increased the modulus and the fracture stress of biscuits. The relative {{magnitude of this}} effect depended on the fat type. Sucrose syrup slightly enhanced the brittle character of biscuits, compared with crystalline sucrose, indicating that sucrose crystals were not the fracture-inducing defects. <b>Substituting</b> <b>starch</b> {{for part of the}} flour had relatively little effect on the {{mechanical properties}}. Sugar-free biscuits had a significantly lower modulus and fracture stress. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that, irrespective of composition, starch gelatinisation was slight, presumably due to the limited water content coupled with the low baking temperature. It is concluded that biscuits comprise a glassy matrix; their mechanical properties are mainly determined by air and fat volume fraction as well as the size of inhomogeneities. © 1999 Academic Press...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{different}} ionic liquids (IL), mainly 1 -N-alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chlorides as possible catalysts for esterification of starch is reported. A high amylose maize starch is {{used and the}} esterification is performed with the aid {{of different}} carboxylic anhydrides. These are used both as a reactant and a solvent for all reactions using a maximum of 1. 2 molar equivalents (moleq) of IL per anhydro glucose unit (AGU). Highly <b>substituted</b> <b>starch</b> esters can be achieved within a 4 - 24 h reaction time depending on the molar ratios of ionic liquid and esterifying agent.

There are two classes of starch phosphate esters, <b>substituted</b> <b>starch</b> phosphate esters dan cross linked starch esters. First, pregelatinized cassava starch was phosphorylated by adding phosphorous oxychloride (POCl 3) for making cross-linked reaction (CPCS). Secondly, pregelatinized cassava starch was phosphorylated by adding sodium monohydrogen phosphate (Na 2 HPO 4) for making substituted reaction (PCSN). Both pregelatinized starch phosphates subsequently were used as hydrophilic polymer matrix tablet controlled release with various concentrations. The tablets were prepared separately by directing compression process and theophyline {{was used as a}} model of the active ingredient. The USP Basket was selected to perform the dissolution test of the tablets, which carried out separately in 0. 1 N HCl (pH 1. 8) and in phosphate buffer of pH 7. 2 both for 3 h.

40|$|The {{experiences}} on cellulose research in our region, first in Teltow {{and later in}} Potsdam-Golm, have extended over many years since the 1920 s with {{the foundation of the}} Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken in Teltow-Seehof, followed by the Institut für Faserforschung and the Institut für Polymerforschung of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR, up to the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer Research IAP, which is now situated in Potsdam-Golm. While the original fiber production in Teltow-Seehof was based on the viscose process, which is still the dominating process for producing man-made cellulose fibers, alternative ecologically friendly procedures have been developed {{in the course of the}} years. One of these developments concerns the so called CarbaCell process, whereby the chemical modification of cellulose with urea (instead of carbon disulphide in the viscose process) leads to cellulose carbamate, which can be spun and regenerated. Another alternative is the direct solution procedure in N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide monohydrate (NMMNO*H 2 O). This non-derivatizing solvent for cellulose can also be used for several homogeneous chemical reactions, whereby in comparison with the classical heterogeneous slurry processes, a completely different distribution of substituents in the anhydroglucose unit and also along the polymer chain is achieved. The substitution pattern has a high influence on the properties of the products, especially on the solution behavior. Also, anorganic cellulose esters like phosphates and sulfates can be synthesized regioselectively at positions C 6 or C 2 /C 3. Especially the cellulose sulfate with substitutions at position C 6 is a suitable material for the micro-encapsulation of living cells for clinical applications. Slightly substituted cellulose derivatives are also the starting point for the formation of nanocellulose, which is prepared as a clear and opalescent dispersion after a mechanical treatment. Another subject matter is the development of starch-based materials. Starting from thermoplastic starch by adding a plasticizer, highly <b>substituted</b> <b>starch</b> esters are developed, which show mechanical properties like petrochemical-based thermoplastic materials.

A series of experiments were conducted to assess the fermentation kinetics of HTDA (chopped [CA] or ground [GA]) and either S or I mixed in the following ratios; 100 : 0, 80 : 20, 60 : 40, 40 : 60 and 20 : 80 S/I: CA/GA, respectively. For each experiment, a further set of bottles containing identical ratios of S/I: CA/GA were also prepared, with the exception that the alfalfa received a simulated foregut digestion treatment (SFD) as prior to incubation. Total gas production increased (P< 0. 05) as the ratio of S/I to alfalfa increased. Total gas production was lower in bottles containing SFD-treated alfalfa (P< 0. 001). Dry matter loss decreased proportionately with increasing level of alfalfa substitution of S/I (P< 0. 001). Values for pH were lower in bottles containing S or I, with pH values in bottles containing S alone falling to almost 6 and those with I dropping to pH 5 and under. However, the substitution of S or I with 40 % alfalfa produced pH values above 6. 7, which is within physiological levels encountered in the large intestine of the horse. Consequently, there appears to be considerable potential to buffer the deleterious effects of high-starch/fructan diets with the substitution of these substrates with high-temperature dried alfalfa...|$|R

In Exp. 1, 198 pigs (initially 9. 4 lb and 19 d of age) {{were used to determine}} if modified potato starch (potato starch 1) can replace a portion of the lactose in a high nutrient dense diet. Pigs were allotted by weight, gender, and ancestry to each of six dietary treatments with either five or six pigs per pen and six pens per treatment. The control diet contained 10 % dried whey (7. 2 % lactose), 7. 5 % spray-dried porcine plasma, 2. 5 % select menhaden fish meal, and 1. 75 % spray-dried blood meal. Additional treatments were formulated by adding 7 or 14 % modified potato starch or lactose in place of com. A positive control diet also was formulated containing 29 % dried whey (providing the same amount of lactose as the 10 % dried whey plus 14 % lactose diet). All diets were formulated to contain 1. 5 % lysine, and. 90 % Ca,. 80 % P, and 17. 88 % soybean meal and were fed in a meal form. From day 0 to 14 postweaning, increasing dietary lactose tended to linearly improve ADG and ADFI. Added potato starch did not improve ADG compared with pigs fed the control diet, but ADFI increased linearly with increasing potato starch. In Exp. 2, 180 pigs (8. 5 lb and 14 d of age) were used to evaluate the effects of two modified potato starches (potato starch 1 or potato starch 2,a further hydrolyzed potato starch with a greater percentage of sugars as either glucose or maltose as a replacement for either com or lactose in a segregated early-weaning diet (SEW). Pigs were fed a control diet containing 15 % dried whey, 12 % added lactose, 6 % porcine plasma, and 6 % select menhaden fish meal. Modified potato starch 1 or 2 (12 %) replaced either corn or the added lactose on an equal weight basis. From d 0 to 7 postweaning, pigs fed the modified potato starch 1 had greater ADG and ADFI than those fed modified potato starch 2. Pigs fed diets with either <b>starch</b> <b>substituted</b> for corn had greater ADG than those fed diets with either <b>starch</b> <b>substituted</b> for lactose. From d 0 to 14 and d o to 21, pigs fed diets containing either modified potato <b>starch</b> <b>substituted</b> for corn tended to have greater ADG than those fed the control diet.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} onto a softwood pulp of cationic modified starches with {{a degree}} of substitution (DS) ranging from 0. 015 to 0. 130 and native potato starch was investigated using a method based on size exclusion chromatography-multi angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS). This technique provides information about the amount and molecular composition of the adsorbed starch product such as the APAM-ratio, the average MW and molar mass distribution. Factors influencing adsorption, like the electrolyte content in the suspension and the initial starch polysaccharide concentration, were investigated. Furthermore, hand sheets were made and the resulting mechanical paper strength was tested. Results were analysed statistically using analysis of variance. Representative results were discussed in detail. In general, low-substituted cationic starch (DS 0. 030) exhibited a higher degree of adsorption and resulted in high paper strength when there was a low electrolyte content in the starchpulp-suspension. However, high amounts of electrolytes impeded electrostatic interaction of the charged groups of the starch polysaccharides and cellulose fibre due to partial screening and therefore strongly limited adsorption. This resulted in lowered mechanical paper strength. The water quality of the suspensions had little impact on the polyelectrolyte adsorption of the highly substituted cationic starch (DS 0. 100). However, paper strength was markedly higher in the case of starch adsorption where there was a high ionic content and when both starch polysaccharidesAP and AM were adsorbed. The initial starch concentration determined starch adsorption both quantitatively and qualitatively and subsequently paper strength as well. The relation between adsorption behaviour and paper strength was discussed, particularly in the case of 6 % initial starch concentration. In deionised water (DW), the low-substituted starch (DS 0. 03) adsorbed onto the pulp to a greater extent with an APAM-ratio {{similar to that of the}} initial starch. Moreover, this achieved the best strength properties in contrast to 36 dGH, where less starch adsorbed and that being almost exclusively AP. In water with 36 dGH, the highly <b>substituted</b> <b>starch</b> (DS 0. 100) with both the AP and AM was absorbed and this resulted in higher paper strength. In contrast, AM was almost exclusively adsorbed in DW. Increasing the initial starch concentration increased the amount adsorbed while subsequently changing the APAM-ratio towards increased AM adsorption and decreased AP adsorption in the case of DS 0. 100 in DW. Exclusive adsorption of AM markedly lowered the development of the paper strength...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate whether certain polyols (mannitol, maltitol, sorbitol, lactitol), fructose, oligofructose and polydextrose can replace sugar (by an equal amount of each substitute) in cake formulations. The rheological behaviour of the cake batter and the physical characteristics of the cakes containing sugar substitutes were compared with the respective attributes of the control cake. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to investigate the effect of sugar <b>substitutes</b> on <b>starch</b> gelatinisation. Furthermore sensorial characteristics were evaluated by instrumental measurements and sensory evaluation. The correlation of the batter characteristics with the textural attributes of the final product was also attempted. Results: The best results were obtained by using oligofructose, lactitol or maltitol as sugar replacers, which exhibited similar behaviour to sucrose in terms of batter rheology and increased starch gelatinisation temperature. Fructose and mannitol led to cakes of poor quality characteristics, as was demonstrated by instrumental measurements and sensory evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Batter rheological behaviour as well as the ability of sugar <b>substitutes</b> to increase <b>starch</b> gelatinisation temperature proved to be controlling factors of the textural properties and volume of the cakes.

In the guarana plant, 13 fungal genera were found using MDA and six were found using PDA. In the olive plant, six genera were obtained using PDA and 4 were obtained using MDA. The multivariate analysis results demonstrated the highest fungal diversity from guarana when using MDA medium. Interestingly, some genera were isolated from one specific host or in one specific media, suggesting the importance of these two factors in fungal isolation specificity.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of dietary carbohydrate composition on the production, recovery and degradability of fecal waste from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Dietary carbohydrate composition was altered by <b>substituting</b> <b>starch</b> with non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) while keeping the diets isonitrogenous and isoenergetic. We tested a high starch, low NSP (LNSP) and a low starch, high NSP (HNSP) diet in six identical, small-scale RAS (V = 460 L). Each diet was tested in three independent systems {{over a period of}} six weeks. Shifting dietary carbohydrates from starch to NSPs resulted in a 50 % increase in the production of chemical oxygen demand (COD) based on digestibility. Fecal waste recovery showed a 40 % increase in HNSP treatments when compared with LNSP. Consequently, the COD output from HNSP systems doubled from 91 g to 194 g of COD per kg feed when compared with LNSP. Although COD production was higher in HNSP systems, the COD load on the biofilters was significantly lower when compared with LNSP systems. COD-to-nitrogen (COD/N) ratios in the biofilter load were 1. 7 ± 0. 2 and 2. 2 ± 0. 2 g COD/g N for HNSP and LNSP, respectively. Shifting the dietary carbohydrate composition from starch to NSPs decreased the biodegradability of fecal COD from 66. 3 % to 43. 7 % (P < 0. 001). Fiber analyses revealed that approximately 40 % of the COD in HNSP feces came from cellulose and hemicellulose. The increased COD production of HNSP diets could be exploited by using fecal COD as an internal carbon source in denitrification. Full denitrification would be theoretically possible with a measured COD/N ratio of 7. 2 in the waste stream of HNSP systems. However, it is not clear if the low COD bioavailability of HNSP feces could be a limiting factor. This study shows that COD/N ratios in the biofilter load and system output can be manipulated by changing dietary carbohydrate composition. Although an increased dietary NSP content increased COD production, it also increased COD recovery, decreased COD load on the biofilters and generated sufficient carbon for denitrification on internal sources...|$|R

40|$|Post-weaning {{restriction}} {{strategies are}} used in French rabbit breeding systems to improve the health status, the digestion and the feed efficiency. However, this effect could {{be affected by the}} dietary chemical composition. Thus, we aimed to study the digestive response of the growing rabbit according to a 2 x 2 experimental design: the intake level (free= 100 vs limited to 80 % of the free intake) and the digestible energy "DE" concentration of the diet (control "C" or high "H"). Four groups of 12 rabbits were housed individually in metabolism cages and allotted at weaning (35 d) to four treatments: C 100, C 80, H 100, H 80. The C and H diets were formulated to differ by 16 % for their DE content (9. 69 vs 11. 24 MJ DE/kg as fed resp.), by <b>substituting</b> <b>starch</b> to lipid (141 vs 91 g/kg and 19 vs 72 g/kg), while their NDF level was similar (337 vs 345 g/kg). Animals were fed the experimental diets from 35 to 70 d old. For C 80 and E 80 groups the intake was limited during four weeks after weaning. Digestive efficiency was assessed after two weeks of adaptation to the treatments (49 - 53 d). For rabbits fed freely, the energy digestion was 2. 2 pts higher for H diet (P< 0. 05), leading to a DE level of 10. 90 MJ/kg (vs 9. 71 for C 100 group). The protein digestion was improved by 1. 7 pts for H diet, because more protein was supplied by soya bean meal. Digestive efficiency of restricted rabbits was higher for all nutrients and for the two diets, but especially for H diet. The energy digestion was 2. 7 pts higher for C 80 (64. 4 vs 61. 7 % for C 100) but 5. 3 pts higher for E 80 (69. 2 vs 63. 9 % for H 100), leading to a significant interaction (P= 0. 012 for diet X restriction). The digestibility of crude protein was meanly 6. 1 pts higher for restricted rabbits (78. 7 vs 72. 6 %, P< 0. 001) without interaction with the diet. The restriction also improved the NDF digestion by 6 pts. In conclusion, the digestion of the growing rabbit was improved when restricted fed, but the extent of this effect depends of the dietary composition...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} was to compare the postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses to nutrition bars containing either cross-linked RS type 4 (RS 4 XL) or standard wheat starch in normoglycemic adults (n= 13; age= 27 Â± 5 yr; BMI= 25 Â± 3 kg/m 2). Methods: Volunteers completed three trials during which they consumed a glucose beverage (GLU), a puffed wheat control bar (PWB), and a bar containing cross-linked RS 4 (RS 4 XL) matched for available carbohydrate content. Serial blood samples were collected over two hours and glucose and insulin concentrations were determined and the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) was calculated. Results: The RS 4 XL peak glucose and insulin concentrations were lower than the GLU and PWB (p< 0. 05). The iAUC for glucose and insulin were lower following ingestion of RS 4 compared with the GLU and PWB trials. Conclusions: These data illustrate, for the first time, that directly <b>substituting</b> standard <b>starch</b> with RS 4 XL, while matched for available carbohydrates, attenuated postprandial glucose and insulin levels in humans.

40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed Tissue deposits occur after administration of plasma <b>substitutes.</b> After hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> (HES), deposits may last for months, causing pruritus and impairment of function. Because elimination of HES deposits has not been demonstrated in humans, we studied 26 patients, for up to 7 yr after HES administration, to assess HES storage. HES dose ranged from 0. 34 to 15. 00 g kg– 1 body weight, and administration intervals from 1 day to 7 yr. Biopsies of the liver, muscle, spleen, intestine or skin were studied using light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. HES storage was dose-dependent, decreased in all organs with time and was greater in patients suffering from pruritus. We conclude that tissue deposition of HES is transitory and dose-dependent, with differences between subjects in severity and duration...|$|R

This study determined whether isocaloric substitution of starch for sugar would improve metabolic parameters in Latino (n[*]=[*] 27) and African-American (n[*]=[*] 16) children with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Participants consumed a diet for 9 days to deliver comparable percentages of protein, fat, and carbohydrate as their self-reported diet; however, dietary sugar was reduced from 28 % to 10 % and <b>substituted</b> with <b>starch.</b> Participants recorded daily weights, with calories adjusted for weight maintenance. Participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and oral glucose tolerance testing on Days 0 and 10. Biochemical analyses were controlled for weight change by repeated measures ANCOVA. Reductions in {{diastolic blood pressure}} (- 5 mmHg; P[*]=[*] 0. 002), lactate (- 0. 3 mmol/L; P[*]<[*] 0. 001), triglyceride, and LDL-cholesterol (- 46 % and - 0. 3 mmol/L; P[*]<[*] 0. 001) were noted.

40|$|Esterification {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} methods to alter the structure of starch granules and improve its applications. Conventionally, starch esters are prepared by conventional or dual modification techniques, which have the disadvantages of being expensive, have regent overdoses, and are time-consuming. In addition, the degree of substitution (DS) is often considered as the primary factor in view of its contribution to estimate <b>substituted</b> groups of <b>starch</b> esters. In order to improve the detection accuracy and production efficiency, different detection techniques, including titration, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermal gravimetric analysis/infrared spectroscopy (TGA/IR) and headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC), have been developed for DS. This paper gives a comprehensive overview on the recent advances in DS analysis and starch esterification techniques. Additionally, the advantages, limitations, some perspectives on future trends of these techniques and the applications of their derivatives in the food industry are also presented...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT (214 words) Methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diets cause {{steatohepatitis}} in rodents and {{are used}} to study the pathophysiology of fatty liver disease in human beings. The most widely-used commercial MCD formulas not only lack methionine and choline, but also contain excess sucrose and fat. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether dietary sucrose in the MCD formula plays a role in the pathogenesis of MCD-related liver disease. We prepared two custom MCD formulas, one containing sucrose as the principal carbohydrate and the other <b>substituting</b> sucrose with <b>starch.</b> Mice fed the sucrose-enriched formula developed typical features of MCDrelated liver disease including hepatic steatosis, hepatocellular apoptosis, ALT elevation, lipid peroxidation and hepatic inflammation. In contrast, mice fed MCD-starch were significantly protected against liver injury. MCD-sucrose and MCD-starch mice displayed identical dietrelated abnormalities in hepatic fatty acid uptake and triglyceride secretion. Hepatic de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis, however, were 2 times higher in MCD-sucrose mice tha...|$|R
