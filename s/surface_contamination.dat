Due {{to the end of}} the Cold War, changes in nuclear weapons policy, and years of protests, the Rocky Flats Plant was shut down, with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site. The site's mission then changed to cleanup. The Rocky Flats Plant was declared a CERCLASuperfund site in 1989 and began its transformation to a cleanup site in February 1992. Removal of the plant and <b>surface</b> <b>contamination</b> was largely completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with federal and state agency support and stakeholder input. The cleanup effort decommissioned and demolished over 800 structures; removed over 21 tons of weapons-grade material; removed over 1.3 million cubic meters of waste; and, treated more than 16 million gallons of water. Four groundwater treatment systems were also constructed. The site achieved regulatory closure in 2006.|$|E

Interestingly, one zookeeper was found to be transiently positive for a chimpanzee-specific papillomavirus sequence.

25|$|Some {{archaeologists have}} {{questioned}} these dates. Christian Züchner, relying on stylistic comparisons with similar paintings at other well-dated sites, expressed {{the opinion that}} the red paintings are from the Gravettian period (c. 28,000–23,000BP) and the black paintings are from the Early Magdalenian period (early part of c. 18,00010,000BP). Pettitt and Bahn also contended that the dating is inconsistent with the traditional stylistic sequence {{and that there is}} uncertainty about the source of the charcoal used in the drawings and the extent of <b>surface</b> <b>contamination</b> on the exposed rock surfaces. Stylistic studies showed that some Gravettian engravings are superimposed on black paintings proving the paintings' older origins.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The raising {{frequency}} of cancer diseases {{is leading to}} a widespread application of antineoplastic drugs, thus increasing the probability of workplace <b>surfaces</b> <b>contamination.</b> Most of these drugs are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as known or suspected human carcinogens. Skin absorption is the main route for antineoplastic drugs exposure in occupational settings, therefore cleaning protocols have paramount influence in <b>surfaces</b> <b>contamination</b> and, consequently, in exposure. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess <b>surfaces</b> <b>contamination</b> in a Portuguese chemotherapy unit before and during drug administration, in both preparation and administration facilities. Methods: Samples were collected by wipe-sampling from potentially contaminated surfaces selected by previous protocol observation. Samples were analyzed by HPLCDAD. Cyclophosphamide (CP), 5 -fluorouracil (5 FU), and paclitaxel (PTX) were used as surrogate markers for <b>surfaces</b> <b>contamination</b> for all cytotoxic drugs. Results: From the 34 samples collected before any preparation and administration activities, 41. 2 % were contaminated with 5 -FU (4. 0 - 84. 7 ng/cm 2) and 23. 5 % of the samples were contaminated with CP (19. 8 - 139. 6 μg/cm 2). Only 2 samples presented contamination by PTX (5. 9 %) with a maximum value of 3. 7 ng/cm 2. Of the 37 samples collected during preparation and administration of antineoplastic drugs, 48. 7 % were contaminated with 5 -FU (1. 9 - 88. 7 ng/cm 2) and 24. 3 % with CP (12. 0 - 93. 9 μg/cm 2). None of the samples showed contamination with PTX. Discussion: Data showed differences in contamination levels before and after the handling of antineoplastic drugs in preparation and in administration settings. These results point out the importance of cleaning procedures. This is well in accordance to previous studies that showed how the type of cleaning procedures and products used can be determinant for surfaces decontamination...|$|R
40|$|Micro/nano {{resonant}} cantilevers with a laser deflection readout {{have been}} very popular in sensing applications over the past years. Despite the popularity, however, {{most of the research}} has been devoted to increasing the sensitivity, and very little attention has been focused on effects-induced errors. Among these effects, the surface effects and the so-called readout back-action are the two most influential causes of errors. In this paper, we investigate (1) the influence of the surface effects such as water adsorption, gas adsorption, and generally <b>surface</b> <b>contaminations,</b> and (2) the effect of the laser deflection detection, including power and positions of the laser, on the resonance frequency of silicon cantilevers. Our results show that both the <b>surface</b> <b>contaminations</b> and the laser back-action effects can significantly change the resonant response of the cantilevers. We conclude that the effects have to be taken into account, particularly in the case of ultra high sensitivity cantilevers.

25|$|The {{disease is}} caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. It often occurs in close {{proximity}} to water bodies, but no specific activities that bring people into contact with water have been identified (i.e. fetching of water, fishing, rice farming, washing, bathing, etc.). The mode of transmission of Buruli ulcer is not entirely known. Recent evidence suggests insects may be involved in the transmission of the infection. These insects are aquatic bugs belonging to the genus Naucoris (family Naucoridae) and Diplonychus (family Belostomatidae). Trauma is probably the most frequent means by which M. ulcerans is introduced into the skin from <b>surface</b> <b>contamination.</b> The initial trauma can be a mild skin wound such as scratch or as severe. Other studies have suggested aerosol spread but these are not proven. In Australia, animals such as koalas and possums are naturally infected. Epidemiological evidence has not clearly supported person-to-person transmission. However, Muelder & Nourou found that 10 out of 28 patients had relatives who had also had the disease, and cautioned against the dismissal of person-to-person transmission. Given the number of patients who shed large numbers of bacilli from their wounds and live in very close contact with relatives, more cases should have been observed. The cases reported by Muelder & Nourou could perhaps have been exposed to a common source of infection, and there might also be genetic component to sensitivity to the disease.|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the surface chemistry, including <b>surface</b> <b>contaminations,</b> of SnO 2 nanowires deposited on Ag-covered Si substrate by vapor phase deposition (VPD), thanks to x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) {{in combination with}} thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). Air-exposed SnO 2 nanowires are slightly non-stoichiometric, and {{a huge amount of}} C contaminations is observed at their surface. After the thermal physical desorption (TPD) process, SnO 2 nanowires become almost stoichiometric without any <b>surface</b> C <b>contaminations.</b> This is probably related to the fact that C contaminations, as well as residual gases from air, are weakly bounded to the crystalline SnO 2 nanowires and can be easily removed from their surface. The obtained results gave us insight on the interpretation of the aging effect of SnO 2 nanowires that is of great importance for their potential application in the development of novel chemical nanosensor devices.|$|R

2500|$|There are two end {{members in}} the {{spectrum}} of types of aquifers; confined and unconfined (with semi-confined being in between). Unconfined aquifers are sometimes also called water table or phreatic aquifers, because their upper boundary is the water table or phreatic surface. (See Biscayne Aquifer.) Typically (but not always) the shallowest aquifer at a given location is unconfined, meaning {{it does not have}} a confining layer (an aquitard or aquiclude) between it and the surface.

This term is generally used to refer to a small local area of ground water that occurs at an elevation higher than a regionally extensive aquifer.
