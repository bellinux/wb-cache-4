5|$|A report {{published}} by the city in 2007 declared the line a success and stated that all goals for the line had been exceeded. A {{survey conducted by the}} city in 2003 and 2007 showed that the Ring Line {{had a significant impact on}} the use of public transport in the area. Total public transport usage increased from 28 to 45%; use for commuting increased from 35 to 61%. At the Norwegian School of Management (BI), 85% of the <b>students</b> <b>used</b> public transport. The Ring Line reduced the estimated number of daily car trips by 10,000, and generated 11,000 more daily public transport trips. In 2007, daily passenger numbers at the stations were 8420 for Nydalen, 3630 for Storo and 2300 at Sinsen. The line allowed travel time from the Nydalen and Storo to the city centre to be halved, and travel time from Nydalen to the city center is faster by metro than by taxi.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Norman broke a hip and {{her health}} began to decline. Although she {{had promised to}} live until 2001, her deteriorating {{condition}} made her followers suspect she would die before then, causing them some distress and denial. In an attempt to help her recover, <b>students</b> <b>used</b> past-life regression to recall interactions with her, and some became very emotional after experiencing memories of events {{in which they had}} rejected and hurt her. Norman returned to leading services in February 1989, making a quicker than expected recovery, which was attributed to the past-life rituals. After a period of good health, her condition again deteriorated, prompting students to resume recounting their past crimes. Norman lost most of her hearing and experienced chronic pain; she was admitted to a hospital in December 1989, but by the summer she was well enough to be present at events. She was nearly bedridden in her last years and was attended to by some followers. In 1991, she stated that the Space Brothers had given her permission to die before their expected arrival in 2001.|$|E

This study attempts {{to determine the effects of}} using word-processing equipment in writing instruction. This goal was accomplished by conducting a meta-analysis of the findings of individual studies that compared the quality of writing samples of <b>students</b> <b>using</b> word-processing equipment versus <b>students</b> <b>using</b> traditional writing methods. A thorough computer and bibliography search for experimental studies that could be applied to this meta-analysis yielded over 100 "potential" article titles. After applying specific selection criteria to the studies, only 14 experiments were identified as acceptable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The 14 studies yielded 27 independent effect-size-variable statistics: 12 related to quality, 6 related to attitude, 6 related to essay length, and 3 related to quantity of revisions. Results of the meta-analysis support the following conclusions: (1) There is a small, but significant, improvement in the writing quality of those <b>students</b> <b>using</b> word-processing equipment when compared to those <b>students</b> <b>using</b> traditional writing methods. (2) There are no significant differences in the writing quality among those <b>students</b> <b>using</b> computer-prompted idea-generation word-processing equipment, <b>students</b> <b>using</b> word-processing equipment with text-analysis features, and <b>students</b> <b>using</b> only word-processing equipment. (3) There is no significant difference in the effects of using word-processing equipment on writing quality among inexperienced and experienced student writers. (4) There is a medium, significant, and negative effect in the quantity of revisions performed by <b>students</b> <b>using</b> word-processing equipment and those using traditional writing methods. (5) There is a small, significant, and positive effect in the length of essays produced by <b>students</b> <b>using</b> word-processing equipment and those using traditional writing methods.

These sports include bodybuilding, weightlifting, shot put and other track and field, cycling, baseball, wrestling, mixed martial arts, boxing, football, and cricket. Such use is prohibited by the rules of the governing bodies of most sports. AAS use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. It has been suggested that the prevalence of use among high-school students in the U.S. may be as high as 2.7%.

25|$|The {{practice}} of dissection flourished under Aryan rule during the 7th and 8th century. It was under their rule that medical education was standardized. This created {{a need to}} better understand human anatomy, so as to have educated surgeons. Dissection was limited by the religious taboo on cutting the human body. This changed the approach taken to accomplish the goal. The process involved the loosening of the tissues in streams of water before the outer layers were sloughed off with soft implements to reach the musculature. To perfect the technique of slicing, the prospective <b>students</b> <b>used</b> gourds and squash. These techniques of dissection gave rise to an advanced understanding of the anatomy and the enabled them to complete procedures used today, such as rhino-plasty.|$|E
25|$|The post-1956 liberalizing trend, {{in decline}} {{for a number}} of years, was {{reversed}} in March 1968, when student demonstrations were suppressed during the 1968 Polish political crisis. Motivated in part by the Prague Spring movement, the Polish opposition leaders, intellectuals, academics and <b>students</b> <b>used</b> a historical-patriotic Dziady theater spectacle series in Warsaw (and its termination forced by the authorities) as a springboard for protests, which soon spread to other centers of higher education and turned nationwide. The authorities responded with a major crackdown on opposition activity, including the firing of faculty and the dismissal of students at universities and other institutions of learning. At the center of the controversy was also the small number of Catholic deputies in the Sejm (the Znak Association members) who attempted to defend the students.|$|E

The study also provided descriptive information about each of these variables. ^ The population for this study was limited to Class II, Class III, Class IV, Class V, and Class VI public high schools in the State of Nebraska which had access to the Internet. The high school principals and the technology coordinators at all one hundred eighty (180) high schools that matched the requirement for participation were surveyed. Administrator concerns about Internet were measured with the 35 question Stages of Concern (SoC) survey. Teacher use of Internet and on-site technical assistance were measured with a 18 question section of the technology coordinator survey. <b>Student</b> <b>use</b> of Internet in school was measured with a 14 question section in both the administrator and technology coordinator surveys. ^ Significant positive correlations were found between teacher use of Internet and <b>student</b> <b>use</b> of Internet in school (. 672) and between availability of on-site technical assistance and <b>student</b> <b>use</b> of Internet in school (. 245).

25|$|In the Netherlands, <b>students</b> <b>used</b> {{to receive}} {{four years of}} {{preclinical}} training, followed by two years of clinical training (co-assistentschappen, or co-schappen for short) in hospitals. However, {{for a number of}} medical schools this has recently changed to three years of preclinical training, followed by three years of clinical training. At least one medical faculty, that of the Utrecht University, clinical training already begins in the third year of medical school. After 6 years, students graduate as basisartsen (comparable to Doctors of Medicine). As a result of the Bologna process, medical students in the Netherlands now receive a bachelor's degree after three years in medical school and a master's degree upon graduation. Prospective students can apply for medical education directly after finishing the highest level of secondary school, vwo; previous undergraduate education is not a precondition for admittance.|$|E

[...] "Death" [...] included a consistency error in that Mr. Garrison's classroom had its own separate bathroom, which was never again seen in future South Park episodes. During one scene, Cartman moons Kyle while making fun of Kyle's mother. Comedy Central censors forced Parker and Stone to remove the image of Cartman's bare bottom, although such images would be allowed in future episodes. A man named Mr. McCormick was killed in [...] "Death" [...] after he was flung via slingshot into the Cartoon Central building. The character's name led many to mistakenly believe it was Kenny's father, Stuart McCormick, but Parker denied this and said the similar character names were just a coincidence.
