5|$|As {{with its}} first landfall, Hurricane Dean damaged crops {{throughout}} its impact area. In Puebla it destroyed 135,000ha (335,000acre) {{of corn and}} more than 22,000ha (54,000acre) of coffee, while in Veracruz 15,000ha (37,000acre) of various crops were lost. Unlike in Belize and the Eastern Caribbean, the storm <b>spared</b> <b>the</b> sugarcane crop in Veracruz.|$|E

In 273 Palmyra rebelled {{under the leadership}} of Septimius Apsaios, declaring Antiochus (a relative of Zenobia) as Augustus. Aurelian marched against Palmyra, razing it to the ground and seizing the most valuable monuments to decorate his Temple of Sol. Palmyrene buildings were smashed, residents massacred and the Temple of Bel pillaged.|$|E

5|$|After {{his service}} in the Senate, Rowan {{returned}} to Kentucky, dividing his time between Louisville and Bardstown. During an epidemic of cholera that spread through Bardstown in 1833, three of Rowan's children (William, Atkinson, and Mary Jane) died. The spouses of William and Mary Jane also died of cholera, as did Mary Jane's daughter, and Rowan's sister Elizabeth and her husband. Aid from Bishop Joseph Flaget {{and a group of}} nuns who traveled to Federal Hill during the epidemic probably <b>spared</b> <b>the</b> life of Rowan's orphaned granddaughter, Eliza Rowan Harney.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow during the peace negotiations. The four Helgoland-class ships were allowed to remain in Germany, however, and were therefore <b>spared</b> <b>the</b> destruction of the fleet in Scapa Flow. Ostfriesland and her sisters were eventually ceded to the victorious Allied powers as war reparations; Ostfriesland {{was transferred to the}} United States Navy.

Percy swore in the chapel he would not harm the king.

5|$|Early on November 30, as {{the system}} moved towards the east-southeast, TCWC Nadi issued a gale warning for the Cook Islands of Rarotonga and Mangaia, while issuing strong wind {{warnings}} and tropical cyclone alerts {{for the rest of}} the Southern Islands. The warnings were subsequently maintained until later that day, as Sina <b>spared</b> <b>the</b> Cook Islands its major effects and re-curved sharply towards the south-southeast. Only minor damage to shallow rooted crops and weak structures was reported, after high seas and gale force winds buffeted the northern side of Rarotonga.|$|E
5|$|Menominees from Green Bay, who had mobilized a {{battalion}} of nearly 300 men, arrived {{too late for the}} battle. They were upset at having missed the chance to fight their old enemies, and so on August 10, General Scott sent 100 of them after a part of the British Band that had escaped. Indian agent Samuel C. Stambaugh, who accompanied them, urged the Menominees not to take any scalps, but Chief Grizzly Bear insisted that such a prohibition could not be enforced. The group tracked down about ten Sauks, only two of whom were warriors. The Menominees killed and scalped the warriors, but <b>spared</b> <b>the</b> women and children.|$|E
5|$|On April29, 1963, {{less than}} half a year after Karen, Typhoon Olive caused {{extensive}} damage in Guam and the Mariana Islands. With many residents living in tents, and debris from the storm still scattered about, severe damage was anticipated. Schools, churches, and other structures were opened as shelters in order to protect those without homes. Ultimately, Guam was <b>spared</b> <b>the</b> worst of the storm though much of Saipan was devastated. The island was again devastated in 1976 by Typhoon Pamela which buffeted the island with destructive winds for 36hours. Though weaker than Karen, the longer lasting impact of Pamela was regarded as more destructive.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with four}} other {{scientists}} and various military personnel, von Neumann {{was included in the}} target selection committee responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the first targets of the atomic bomb. Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital Kyoto, which had been <b>spared</b> <b>the</b> bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves. However, this target was dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} renewal {{of the civil war}} in 1352, these factors {{destroyed}} any chance of even a modest recovery similar to that experienced under Andronikos III. Thereafter, Byzantium remained under the menacing threat of stronger neighbours, unable to pursue an independent foreign policy, handicapped by a shortage of resources and riven by internal strife. Nevertheless, through a combination of fortuitous external circumstances and adroit diplomacy, it survived for another century, until finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Only the Byzantine exclave in the Morea remained prosperous, having been <b>spared</b> <b>the</b> ravages of the civil war because of its relative isolation. The appointment of Manuel Kantakouzenos as its despotes in 1349 heralded the creation of the semi-independent Despotate of the Morea, which experienced the last economic and cultural flowering of the Byzantine world before it too fell to the Ottomans in 1460.|$|E
5|$|Aurelian, {{learning}} about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the queen {{before she could}} cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent the queen and her son to Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The queen's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he <b>spared</b> <b>the</b> queen and her son to parade her in his planned triumph.|$|E
