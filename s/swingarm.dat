5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided <b>swingarm.</b> The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on stub axles attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E
5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear <b>swingarm</b> motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E
25|$|Hypoid {{gears and}} a shaft turns the rear wheel, with the shaft housing forming {{the left side}} <b>swingarm.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{production}} motorcycles, <b>swingarms</b> are {{not exactly}} rectangular, but their function can be more easily understood by thinking of them as such.|$|R
50|$|The F800S and ST both used low-maintenance {{belt drives}} and single sided <b>swingarms.</b> Bikes {{equipped}} with ABS {{also included a}} rear-wheel lift detection system.|$|R
50|$|Drag racing {{motorcycles}} (called dragbikes) {{will often}} use longer <b>swingarms</b> {{to keep their}} center of gravity as forward as possible, which reduces the tendency to wheelie at the start.|$|R
25|$|The H2 and H2R have a tubular, {{thin-wall}} steel {{trellis frame}} and a single-sided <b>swingarm,</b> with traditional sportbike wheelbase.|$|E
25|$|High speed {{motorcycles}} {{often have}} long wheelbases: extra length is added by the extended <b>swingarm</b> {{on a typical}} dragbike; a typical land speed record streamliner has a meters-long wheelbase (3.7 meters for the current record holder, Ack Attack).|$|E
25|$|The Tonti {{frame was}} {{engineered}} for stiffness using short, straight tubes working {{well with the}} engine design and allowing the main backbone {{to pass through the}} cylinder splay and connect the steering head to the <b>swingarm</b> in the shortest possible distance.|$|E
50|$|The 400 was {{produced}} for Japan since 1989 {{due to the}} demand for 400cc motorcycles in that market. It was very popular. Many aftermarket parts were produced, with companies like Over Racing producing exhausts, <b>swingarms,</b> fairings and engine modifications.|$|R
50|$|Belgarda also {{produced}} in limited numbers TZR125RRs and TZR125R SPs which have varying <b>swingarms</b> and increased power ratings. The 4DL shares the same frame as some {{versions of the}} TZR250 and was also used for the Yamaha SZR660 Belgarda which uses an XT660 engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame is}} {{conventional}} steel tube {{with the engine}} supported in a removable cradle. The suspension configuration {{is similar to that}} found on a UJM. The rear shocks, designed with a piggyback reservoir, are adjustable for preload and damping. The front suspension consists of conventional forks with adjustable damping and preload. The reinforced swing arm was designed to mimic the modified/aftermarket <b>swingarms</b> produced in the 1970s.|$|R
25|$|In 1994, {{the company}} {{introduced}} the Ducati 916 model designed by Massimo Tamburini, a water-cooled version that allowed for higher output levels and a striking new bodywork that had aggressive lines, an underseat exhaust, and a single-sided <b>swingarm.</b> Ducati has since ceased {{production of the}} 916, supplanting it (and its progeny, the 748, 996 and 998) with the 749 and 999.|$|E
25|$|Scooter engine sizes range {{smaller than}} motorcycles, , and have all-enclosing {{bodywork}} {{that makes them}} cleaner and quieter than motorcycles, as well as having more built-in storage space. Automatic clutches and continuously variable transmissions (CVT) make them easier to learn on and to ride. Scooters usually have smaller wheels than motorcycles. Scooters usually have the engine {{as part of the}} <b>swingarm,</b> so that their engines travel up and down with the suspension.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} was upgraded with a 43mm Kayaba inverted fork with sliders {{having a}} diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating. The rear shock {{is also a}} Kayaba, and the overall suspension is firmer than the previous model. The <b>swingarm</b> is similar in design to the old one, but was strengthened. Front and rear remain fully adjustable. The transmission was given a heavier-duty, slipper clutch. The final drive ratio was slightly lower, and gears 5-6 were spaced farther apart, and gear ratios 1-2 moved closer together.|$|E
50|$|Heli Modified {{began as}} a {{specialty}} welding shop in the greater Boston area. The company name is derived from heli- arc welding - a type of welding using a tungsten electrode and helium as a shielding gas. Throughout the 1980s, Harry Eddy created custom ergonomic applications for motorcycles. Some of his early designs included replacement <b>swingarms</b> for BMWs, off-road modifications and adapting a Harley-Davidson with hand controls for a motorcyclist with an amputated leg.|$|R
5000|$|Announced in 1988, the Ducati SuperSport used a Pantah based 904 cc {{air-cooled}} 90° V-twin, two-valve [...] "Desmodue" [...] engine with crankcases {{derived from}} the 851 motor. It was mounted in a tubular trellis frame. The resurrection was due largely to Ducati being bought out by Cagiva and the first reborn SuperSport was released as a 750 Sport. It met with failure due to its 16-inch wheels and a kludgy Weber carburator and cracking <b>swingarms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 1991 Supersports were {{produced}} with white chrome molybdenum steel frames and white wheels. The <b>swingarms</b> used needle bearings instead of bushings {{as in the}} past. Brakes from the Ducati 851 were used on the Supersport vastly improving braking performance. All new bodywork and a pivoting fuel tank were elegantly shaped. The revised Supersports were met with immediate success and became wildly popular. Even though the 1991 Supersport was extremely well developed, Ducati would continue to refine the bike over the years.|$|R
25|$|Dyna-frame {{motorcycles}} {{were developed}} in the 1980s and early 1990s and debuted in the 1991 model year with the FXDB Sturgis offered in limited edition quantities. In 1992 the line continued with the limited edition FXDB Daytona and a production model FXD Super Glide. The new DYNA frame featured big-twin engines and traditional styling. They can be distinguished from the Softail by the traditional coil-over suspension that connects the <b>swingarm</b> to the frame, and from the Sportster by their larger engines. On these models, the transmission also houses the engine's oil reservoir.|$|E
500|$|The {{engine and}} {{transmission}} were mounted {{together on the}} <b>swingarm</b> {{in front of the}} pivot axle {{at the bottom of the}} spine frame. The near-horizontal engine and transmission together as a unit formed a [...] "power egg" [...] style which would later be used by Benelli and Motobi. The tubular <b>swingarm</b> also served as the exhaust pipe. Behind the pivot axle, the <b>swingarm,</b> the reinforced rear fender, and the supports for the rear carrier formed a triangular structure which supported the rear spring. This suspension system allowed a long suspension travel and a soft spring rate. Test rides on the complete prototype began in December 1947 and showed that the combination of long travel and soft springs needed damping. Friction dampers were added.|$|E
500|$|The Imme R100 {{is noted}} for its simple and {{innovative}} design. Its advanced features include single-sided suspension front and rear, interchangeable wheels front and rear with the option of a spare tyre, the complete drivetrain mounted on the <b>swingarm,</b> and the <b>swingarm</b> tube used as the exhaust pipe. Remarking on the R100 being displayed in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum exhibition [...] "The Art of the Motorcycle", Ultan Guilfoyle, curatorial adviser at the museum, said: [...] "It's my favourite unknown bike. There are ideas there that are 40 years ahead of their time." [...] An R100 is on permanent display at the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum.|$|E
50|$|Rupp {{cut back}} their mini bike offerings in 1972. They still offered the Hustler, Scrambler and Roadster 2. No new Enduros or Black Widows were {{produced}} though some were sold. The major {{change to the}} lineup was the color scheme. All Rupps now came with black frames, <b>swingarms</b> and motorcycle fork; the gas tanks and rear fenders were the only painted items. The specs of the bikes remained the same. The Hustler and Scrambler were offered in red only. The Roadster 2 was additionally available in a copper color.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{computer}} imaging, the suspension {{would allow a}} lean of up to 45° with all four wheels maintaining contact with the ground before one of the <b>swingarms</b> contacted the ground, although attempting to actually corner at such extreme angles is not safe given the Tomahawk's 1,500 lb weight. Test rides {{for the purpose of}} photographing the Tomahawk in action revealed that there were still stability issues to be worked out, given that it rides, [...] "like two motorcycles riding in ultraclose formation, coupled with the weight of three and the horsepower of four," [...] in Karr's words, meaning that, [...] "some disagreement is inevitable." ...|$|R
5000|$|Redline Racing Frames {{was founded}} in 1970 by Linn Kastan and Mike Konle in Chatsworth California for making chromoly {{motorcycle}} frames and <b>swingarms.</b> The company consisted of a staff of six people and was receiving much success with their motorcycle <b>swingarms.</b> In 1973 Kastan decided he would weld a bicycle frame for his son as a Christmas gift that same year. His son soon raced this bike under his fathers company name Redline. The bike was noticed by a company called Pedalers West and they challenged Kastan {{to come up with}} a stronger and lighter fork specifically for 20 inch BMX racing. Kastan accepted the challenge. In February 1974 the first pairs of tubular chromoly forks were being produced. They were an instant success and became a favorite amongst racers at the time. Later that year Redline would release its first chromoly frame, the Squareback. Due to the high price at the time of $85 the sales were dismal. In 1977 Kastan and Konle agreed to go separate ways and Kastan would take over full ownership of Redline Racing Frames and Konle would carry on with the motorcycle side renaming his company Champion. By this time Kastan had designed and was releasing the Proline, their first official Team Model frame and fork. Soon after the famous V-Bars handlebars, the MXll frame and the Microline frame (mini series) were released. With these additions the company was gaining success again and by January 1980, Redline Flight cranks were going into production. They would be BMX's first tubular chromoly three piece cranks which would become Redline's most popular product.|$|R
2500|$|Giuseppe Guzzi (14 August 1882 [...] 6 June 1962): Carlo's brother, {{rode the}} famed GT Norge on the 1928 Arctic Circle raid {{to test the}} first {{motorcycle}} rear <b>swingarm</b> suspension.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} Chief Classic has the valanced fenders and {{the lighted}} [...] "war bonnet" [...] {{on the front}} fender. Cruise control, antilock braking system, keyless starting, and electronic fuel injection are standard on this and all other models. It has a six-speed transmission and manually-adjustable single-shock <b>swingarm.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Lou Gerencer, Sr. built a hillclimbing XR-750 with an {{extended}} <b>swingarm</b> {{that made the}} bike half again as long. Adapted with mechanical fuel injection and nitrous oxide, Gerencer estimated his engine produced over [...] The overstressed engine did not last long, but held together long enough to win the AMA hillclimb championship.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, the G/S {{name was}} changed to GS with the S meaning [...] "Sport" [...] rather than [...] "Straße" [...] and the Monolever was {{replaced}} with the Paralever <b>swingarm,</b> which included a torque arm intended to lessen shaft effect and strengthen the swingarm-to-final drive connection. The new bikes were produced with engines of 797.5cc (R80GS) or 980cc (R100GS).|$|E
2500|$|For the 2009 model year, Harley-Davidson {{redesigned}} {{the entire}} touring range with several changes, {{including a new}} frame, new <b>swingarm,</b> a completely revised engine-mounting system, [...] front wheels {{for all but the}} FLHRC Road King Classic, and a 2–1–2 exhaust. The changes result in greater load carrying capacity, better handling, a smoother engine, longer range and less exhaust heat transmitted to the rider and passenger.|$|E
2500|$|The Breva 1100, Norge, Bellagio, Stelvio and 1200 Sport feature Guzzi's {{recently}} patented <b>swingarm</b> system, {{marketed as}} Compact Reactive Shaft Drive [...] {{also known as}} Ca. R.C. or CARC [...] introduced with the Breva 1100 in 2005. The system separates the shaft final drive’s torque reaction from the suspension via floating torque arms and thereby eliminates the abruptness typical of shaft drive systems on acceleration or throttle-release [...] still providing a quiet, reliable and low maintenance drive system. Reviewers have observed excellent braking performance and drive train smoothness attributable to the CARC system.|$|E
2500|$|The first shaft driven GS {{model was}} the R80G/S with a 797.5cc air-cooled, {{flat-twin}} boxer engine. [...] The BMW 247 engine, {{which was also}} fitted to many other bikes in the BMW range, is known as an airhead, because it relies on airflow across the cylinder heads and cylinder 'barrels' to provide most of the cooling for the engine. The most valued version was the R80G/S-PD [...] "Paris-Dakar" [...] model featuring a larger tank, which was launched in celebration of the R80G/S wins in the Paris Dakar Rally. In certain markets a 649.6cc R65GS version was also available. These early machines used a combined rear suspension and drive <b>swingarm</b> called a Monolever.|$|E
2500|$|By 1928, long-distance {{motorcycle}} {{travel was}} {{limited by the}} lack of an effective rear suspension design. [...] Until then, alternative designs sacrificed torsional rigidity [...] gaining comfort but severely compromising handling. Carlo Guzzi and his brother Giuseppe designed an elastic frame using a sheet-steel box enclosing four springs, together with a <b>swingarm</b> in tubes and sheet metal. [...] The first Moto Guzzi bike to employ the suspension was named the G.T. (for Gran Turismo, Grand Touring), and to prove the suspension [...] and gain publicity for Moto Guzzi [...] the brothers conceived a challenging [...] journey from Mandello del Lario to Capo Nord in northern Norway. Despite the very poor condition of European roads at that time, Giuseppe Guzzi reached the Arctic Circle in four weeks. The elastic frame rear suspension was immediately introduced to production machines, transforming the usability of the motorcycle as an everyday form of transportation. [...] In 2006, Moto Guzzi retraced the 'raid' of 1928 to introduce the Norge 1200. The word [...] "Norge" [...] is Norwegian for [...] "Norway".|$|E
5000|$|Traditional monoshock, {{which is}} {{placed at the}} front of the <b>swingarm,</b> above the <b>swingarm</b> pivot bolt ...|$|E
50|$|Cantilever - An {{extension}} of the swinging fork where a triangulated frame transfers <b>swingarm</b> movement to compress shock absorber/s generally mounted {{in front of the}} <b>swingarm.</b> The HRD-Vincent Motorcycle is a famous early form of this type of <b>swingarm,</b> though Matchless used it earlier, and Yamaha subsequently. The Harley-Davidson Softail is another form of this <b>swingarm,</b> though working in reverse, with the shock absorbers being extended rather than compressed.|$|E
50|$|Softail style suspension, {{where the}} shock {{absorbers}} are mounted horizontally {{in front of}} the <b>swingarm,</b> below the <b>swingarm</b> pivot bolt and operate in extension.|$|E
50|$|A {{single-sided}} <b>swingarm</b> {{is a type}} of <b>swingarm</b> {{which lies}} along only one side of the rear wheel, allowing the rear wheel to be mounted like a car wheel (unlike the conventional motorcycle double-sided <b>swingarm).</b> Single-sided swingarms are traditionally found on small motorcycles or scooters, where a robust chain case doubles as the <b>swingarm</b> linking the engine and rear wheel. Single-sided swingarms need to be much stiffer than the double-sided versions, to accommodate the extra torsional forces, and as a result, they are usually heavier than double-sided arms. Having a single mounting point guarantees proper wheel alignment.|$|E
