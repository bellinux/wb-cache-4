40|$|<b>Slanted</b> Cu nanopillars with uniform arrays were fabricat‐ ed using <b>slanted</b> Si channel {{structures}} as templates. A <b>slanted</b> {{plasma etching}} technique was employed, utilizing a Faraday cage {{system for the}} formation of these <b>slanted</b> channel structures. The angle of the <b>slanted</b> channel structures was accurately controlled because ions entering the Faraday cage maintained their direction. After the <b>slanted</b> channel structures were formed, they were filled with Cu by electroless deposition. Chemical mechanical polishing was then used to remove the excess Cu film and the SiO 2 masks. Finally, the remaining poly Si of the channel structures was removed by wet chemical etching.

40|$|National Nature Science Foundation of China [61405214]We {{report the}} {{simplified}} modal method for the <b>slanted</b> grating {{based on the}} accurate dispersion equation. The vividly physical insight is presented to interpret the diffraction process for <b>slanted</b> grating. We also present that the simplified modal method with the two-lowest mode condition is effective for a large <b>slanted</b> angle up to 26 degrees. By examining the eignefunction, the mode index, and the two-lowest mode condition, we provide new evidences to verify the assumption that a <b>slanted</b> grating with subwavelength period can be analyzed as an equivalent rectangular grating using the simplified modal method, which is right and convenient to use for a small <b>slanted</b> angle up to 20 degrees. Numerical simulations of the simplified modal method are coincident with rigorous coupled wave analysis for small <b>slanted</b> angle gratings. Thus the simplified modal method {{can be used for}} small <b>slanted</b> angle grating since the equivalence of <b>slanted</b> grating and rectangular grating is verified due to its vivid physical analysis.

40|$|Perspective (route or survey) {{during the}} {{encoding}} of spatial information can influence recall and navigation performance. In our experiment we investigated a third type of perspective, {{which is a}} <b>slanted</b> view. This <b>slanted</b> perspective is a compromise between route and survey perspectives, offering both information about landmarks as in route perspective and geometric information as in survey perspective. We hypothesized {{that the use of}} <b>slanted</b> perspective would allow the brain to use either egocentric or allocentric strategies during storage and recall. Twenty-six subjects were scanned (3 -Tesla fMRI) during the encoding of a path (40 -s navigation movie within a virtual city). They were given the task of encoding a segment of travel in the virtual city and of subsequent shortcut-finding for each perspective: route, <b>slanted</b> and survey. The analysis of the behavioral data revealed that perspective influenced response accuracy, with significantly more correct responses for <b>slanted</b> and survey perspectives than for route perspective. Comparisons of brain activation with route, <b>slanted,</b> and survey perspectives suggested that <b>slanted</b> and survey perspectives share common brain activity in the left lingual and fusiform gyri and lead to very similar behavioral performance. <b>Slanted</b> perspective was also associated with similar activation to route perspective during encoding in the right middle occipital gyrus. Furthermore, <b>slanted</b> perspective induced intermediate patterns of activation (in between route and survey) in some brain areas, such as the right lingual and fusiform gyri. Our results suggest that the <b>slanted</b> perspective may be considered as a hybrid perspective. This result offer...|$|R
