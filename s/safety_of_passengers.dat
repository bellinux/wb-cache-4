The bridge is [...] long, holding {{a load of}} [...] of traffic from County Route620 Spur (Water Street) in Belvidere to former Pennsylvania Route709 on the Riverton side. The bridge was first constructed in 1836, replacing the local ferry across the river. The board of freeholders in Warren County supported {{the replacement of the}} ferry with a bridge for <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers.</b> In 1832, the state created the Belvidere Delaware Bridge Company, which was funded with the job of building a bridge from Riverton to Belvidere. The new covered bridge was built by Solon Chapin, a contractor from Easton, Pennsylvania. [...] The bridge survived two large storms in 1836 and 1841, although sustained major damage both times. In 1903, the floods that destroyed bridges along the Delaware River Valley, including taking out the entire covered structure at Riverton and Belvidere.

30|$|Fires in {{vehicles}} can {{impact on}} the life <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle occupants {{and the people in}} the vicinity of the fire.

Desperate mothers placed life jackets on their children and tossed them into the water, only to watch in horror as their children sank instead of floating.
