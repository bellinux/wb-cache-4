25|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a series}} of ear-splitting explosions, as Fame dropped a pattern of 10 depth charges. The lights in U-353 went out and water entered forward and aft through the {{hydrophone}} shafts. The electric motors stopped working, {{all but one of}} the depth gauges broke, and the aft hydroplanes were put out of action. U-353 went deeper, almost out of control as water poured in through the stern torpedo tube causing her to lose trim. The U-boat blew her tanks and surfaced, and the captain ordered the crew to prepare to abandon ship.|$|E

500|$|Harry later said: [...] "The newspapers, television, theatres {{and radio}} were all run {{by people of}} a {{different}} generation who {{had no idea of}} what youngsters wanted. For decades they had manipulated and controlled them. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an awareness of being young, and young people wanted their own styles and their own music, just at the time they were beginning to earn money, which gave them the spending power. Mersey Beat was their voice, it was a paper for them, crammed with photos and information about their own groups, which is why it also began to appeal to youngsters throughout Britain as its coverage extended to other areas." [...] Because of the employment situation in Liverpool at the time, The Daily Worker newspaper denounced the enthusiasm of younger people in Liverpool by saying [...] "The Mersey Sound is the sound of 30,000 people on the dole." ...|$|E

500|$|British {{timing was}} good. The Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first {{artificial}} satellite, on 4 October 1957, {{came as a}} tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, <b>suddenly,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action {{in response to the}} Sputnik crisis, officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend the relationship with Britain that had been damaged by the Suez Crisis. At the suggestion of Harold Caccia, the British Ambassador to the United States, Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources to meet the challenge. To do this, the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear cooperation needed to be relaxed. British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb. The trenchant opposition from the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that had derailed previous attempts was absent. Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and were signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958. The 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed on 3 July, and was approved by Congress on 30 July. Macmillan called this [...] "the Great Prize".|$|E

2500|$|During a {{press conference}} {{the day after the}} accident, Captain Peter Burkill said {{that he would not be}} {{publicly}} commenting on the cause of the incident while the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) investigation was in progress. He revealed that Senior First Officer John Coward was flying the aircraft, and that First Officer Conor Magenis was also present on the flight deck at the time of the accident. Coward was more forthcoming in a later interview, stating: [...] "As the final approach started I became aware that there was no power ... <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing from any of the engines, and the plane started to glide." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} days the channel {{operated}} on a £40million budget (plus £10million share of overheads), which led Sam Chisholm, {{chief executive of the}} newly merged BSkyB to suggest to Murdoch that the station to be closed, but Rupert was [...] "pleased with its achievements ... there were overriding reasons of prestige and politics for keeping it ... the final hurdle of the Broadcasting Bill had still to be overcome and the case for the acceptability of Sky would collapse if <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no news channel." [...] – former deputy Prime Minister William Whitelaw said in the House of Lords in 1990 that Sky News had [...] "a very high reputation ... I admire it, as do many other people, it will certainly waken up both the BBC and ITN and ensure that they compete with what is a very important news service". The channel has never been run for a profit, and has considered using ITN to supplement the service.|$|E
