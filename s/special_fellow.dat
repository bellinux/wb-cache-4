5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the <b>special,</b> <b>fellow</b> free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E

50|$|Richard France {{was born}} Richard Zagami in Boston, Massachusetts, son of N. Roy Zagami, a U.S. Army officer, and Rita Foster Zagami. His father's {{military}} postings led France to spend {{nearly half of}} his early years abroad: in Japan (1947-49), Australia (1949-50), and Germany (1953-57). France {{dropped out of high}} school in 1955 in Kaiserslauten and returned to the United States, where he began working at odd jobs, including apprentice trophy maker, radio announcer, and encyclopedia salesman. The resonant, expressive voice that would make France a sought-after narrator and voice-over performer was already evident when he found employment in the mail room at NBC Studios, and was chosen to participate in the NBC Radio Workshop, whose members were coached and mentored by many of the network's distinguished announcing staff. While never attending college at the undergraduate level, France was admitted to the Yale School of Drama as a <b>Special</b> <b>Fellow</b> in Playwriting (1964-66). From there, he went on to earn an M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing (1970) and a Ph.D. in Theatre History / Dramatic Literature (1973) from Carnegie-Mellon University.|$|E
50|$|Hall {{became a}} member of the Illinois Bar in 1923, and began his legal career {{practicing}} corporate law in Chicago from 1923 to 1929. Even during this early stage of his career, the allure of teaching manifested itself, and he began teaching classes in public speaking and business law at the Indiana University Extension (now IU Northwest) in Gary, Indiana. These early teaching experiences fostered a love of teaching, and in 1929, he left his legal practice behind to teach full time, beginning at the University of North Dakota from 1929 to 1932. From 1932 to 1934 he taught as a <b>special</b> <b>fellow</b> at Columbia University, earning his Doctor of the Science of Law (Jur.Sc.D.) in 1935. From 1934 to 1935 he taught as a Benjamin Research Fellow at Harvard Law School, earning the degree of Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.) in 1935. He next moved to Louisiana State University and taught as a professor of law from 1935-1939, before moving to Indiana. Hall spent the majority of his professional career as a professor of law at Indiana University Bloomington from 1939 to 1970. Upon retiring at 65, he was invited to join the esteemed Sixty-Five Club at University of California, Hastings College of the Law, where he continued to teach until 1986.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{chromosome}} segregation requires {{assembly of the}} multiprotein kinetochore complex. Prior work has identified more than 100 different kinetochore components in human cells. However, {{little is known about}} the regulatory processes that specify their assembly upon mitotic entry and disassembly at mitotic exit. In this paper, we used a live-cell imaging–based assay to quantify kinetochore disassembly kinetics and systematically analyze the role of potential regulatory mechanisms in controlling kinetochore assembly state. We find that kinetochore assembly and disassembly was driven primarily by mitotic phosphorylation downstream of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). In addition, we demonstrate that nuclear exclusion of the Ndc 80 complex helped restrict kinetochore formation to mitosis. Combining constitutive CDK-dependent phosphorylation of CENP-T and forced nuclear localization of the Ndc 80 complex partially prevented kinetochore disassembly at mitotic exit and led to {{chromosome segregation}} defects in subsequent divisions. In total, we find that the coordinated temporal regulation of outer kinetochore assembly is essential for accurate cell division. Kinship Foundation.
