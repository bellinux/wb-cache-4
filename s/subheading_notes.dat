40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{rules for}} the classification of goods into a customs tariff which complies with the Harmonized System for the Description and Coding of Goods (HS) are according to General Rule 1, the six general rules of classification, the terms of headings and the notes (and according to General Rule 6 the terms of subheadings and <b>subheading</b> <b>notes).</b> The rules of the tariff schedule are complex, and whilst the overall numbers of headings and subheadings are known, the notes of the HS-nomenclature, the combined nomenclature (CN) and the Common Customs Tariff (CCT) of the European Community (EC) have not been examined in a systematic way. This paper identifies all notes (and <b>subheading</b> <b>notes)</b> which are in force worldwide as at HS 2007 (for sections and chapters) and examines also the sections and chapters for which the EC has established further so-called ‘additional notes’, which are valid only within the EC. The HS 2007 contains 380 notes and 56 <b>subheading</b> <b>notes</b> which are valid worldwide, and the EC has added 98 additional notes within the CN and the CCT (as of May 2007). The 534 notes that accompany the 1, 221 HS-headings, 5, 052 HS-subheadings and 9, 720 CN-subheadings are proof {{of the complexity of}} the rules of the CCT which contains more than 16, 500 legal {{rules for the}} classification of goods...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{rules for}} the classification of goods into a customs tariff which is complying to the Harmonized System for the description and coding of goods (HS) are according to general rule 1 solely the six general rules of classification, the terms of headings and the notes (and according to general rule 6 the terms of subheadings and <b>subheading</b> <b>notes).</b> The rules of the tariff schedule are complex and difficult to overview. The overall numbers of headings and subheadings are known, but the notes of the HS-nomenclature, the Combined Nomenclature (CN) and the Common Customs Tariff (CCT) of the European Union (EU) have only been examined for the CN 2007 in a systematic way. This paper reviews all notes (and <b>subheading</b> <b>notes)</b> which are in force worldwide as by the HS 2017 (in front of sections and chapters), examines the previous versions of the HS 2002, HS 2007, HS 2012 and it examines also the sections and chapters in front of which the EU has placed further so called 2 ̆ 01 cadditional notes 2 ̆ 01 d in its CN which are only valid throughout the EU. The HS 2017 contains 386 notes and 63 <b>subheading</b> <b>notes,</b> which are valid worldwide. The EU has added 109 additional notes within the CN and the CCT (as of December 2016), and can thereby influence {{the application of the}} CCT by help of different and more rigid definitions of goods and methods of analysis. 60 percent of the additional notes are applied for agricultural goods (chapters 01 2 ̆ 013 24). The 558 notes of the CN are legal rules that are used next to the 1, 222 HS-headings, 5, 387 HS-subheadings and 9, 528 CN-subheadings which are an impressive proof of the complexity of the rules of the CCT which contains more than 16, 500 legal {{rules for the}} classification of goods...|$|E
40|$|LLM (Import and Export Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Customs duty {{represents}} an inescapable financial obligation in international trade. Such duties {{are determined by}} valuing the imported goods according to the classification of the goods. To classify the goods under an appropriate tariff heading is notoriously difficult – despite the almost trite principles from judicial decisions amongst the jurisdictions discussed in this study, such as the European Union, Australia, Canada and the United States of America. In South Africa, the Customs and Excise Act 91 of 1964 defines the ambit of customs duties and ratifies the Harmonised System ("HS"). The HS allows for a uniform approach to tariff classification used by countries across the world accounting for in excess of 95 % of the world trade. Countries that employ this system are obliged to incorporate the HS into such country's domestic legislation and to use all headings and subheadings of the HS without addition or alteration, together with the numerical codes and to apply the General Rules for Interpretation and all section, chapter and <b>subheading</b> <b>notes.</b> Classification of goods {{is to be done}} objectively at the time of presentation of the goods to the tax authorities. The intentions of the importer or the descriptions of the goods in advertisements and manuals constitute inadmissible evidence. In the recent judgment of Smith Mining Equipment (Pty) Ltd v The Commissioner: South African Revenue Service 1 ("Smith Mining") the court, however, opined that it was not obliged to consider the notes referred to above, in the absence of evidence on use of the specific vehicles at the different locations allowed for in the Tariff Headings. The Court expected the importer to present evidence on use and relied on evidence from the manual, whilst it ignored the evidence that the importer presented structured along the applicable tariff notes. The court's approach clamped on the Additional Rules in the USA and the more liberal approach applied in Canada, but stands in conflict with the approach in the European Union and the trite principles from the South African case law.
