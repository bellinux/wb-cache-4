500|$|Later that year, Payá's {{efforts were}} {{recognized}} by the European Parliament, which awarded him its <b>Sakharov</b> <b>Prize</b> for Freedom of Thought, although he was nearly denied an exit visa to attend the awards ceremony.

The letter noted that these individuals have sought to [...] "raise the Chinese people's awareness of their dignity and rights, and to call their government to govern within its constitution, its laws, and the international human rights agreements it has signed," [...] and thereby made a significant contribution to peace. The Nobel Prize Committee awarded the honor to Liu in absentia in December 2010.|$|E
