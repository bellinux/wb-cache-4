40|$|Using {{a sample}} {{combining}} various datasets {{over the period}} 2000 to 2012, this paper examines the relationship between media coverage and payout policy in US public firms. I find that media coverage is negatively associated with a firm&# 146;s likelihood of paying dividends and positively associated with the decisions to cut and omit dividends. Firms with high media coverage also have {{a lower level of}} dividend smoothing. These findings are based on a relatively representative sample and persist after accounting for contemporaneous repurchasing activities, different combinations of firm characteristic control variables, and industry, time and firm fixed effects. Moreover, I also find that investors react less negatively to the dividend cut announcements of high coverage firms. Overall, my results suggest that, as higher media coverage attracts more potential investors to a <b>stock,</b> <b>managers</b> become less conservative regarding dividend policy...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{seventeen}} weekly {{stock markets}} returns we reinterpreted using VAR analysis to obtain insights {{in to the}} dynamic interconnections of regional stock markets. Emphasis {{was given to the}} mechanism by which shocks in one stock market are transmitted to other markets overtime. Our evidence indicates that a substantial amount of dynamism exists among the stock markets of Western Europe. Almost 58 % of the total stock markets of Western Europe are interlinked dynamically. Thus, it can be concluded that a proper transmission of information exists within the region. Moreover, Austria and the Netherlands are found to have the most influential stock markets in the Western European region in term of their capability to account for the error variances of other markets. This may reflect the dominant position of both these markets in the Western European region, which probably makes them the most important producers of information affecting the other stock markets of the region. MSCI is found to be dynamically interlinked with most of these stock markets and is also found to be significant in explaining the forecast error variances of some of these selected stock markets. This result implies {{that there will be no}} potential gain from portfolio diversification by <b>stock</b> <b>managers.</b> A significant error correction term implies that the short term disequilibrium in these countries’ stock markets will be corrected significantly by the short term lagged differences of the other stock markets of the region. It is found that the ECTs are significant for the stock markets of Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. The MSCI index is found to be significant with the region and these regional stock markets are found to be dynamically interlinked. Again, according to the findings from the Johansen maximum likelihood estimates, there exists a strong long run equilibrium relationship between the return distributions of the stock markets within the region. The stock markets returns are dynamically interlinked within the region both in the short term and the long term. This further confirms that the diversification of portfolios will not be a good strategy for the <b>stock</b> <b>managers</b> in the Western European region.|$|R

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} the corporate takeover regime and defensive measures against hostile takeover bids in Slovenia. Although takeover legislation does not differentiate between hostile and friendly takeover, it prescribes {{the limitation of}} powers {{for the management of}} the target company, with the intention of preventing the use of defensive measures against the hostile takeover. In light of an expected rise in hostile takeover bids in Slovenia, the Corporate Act and the Takeover Act are analysed and accordingly the array of possible preventive measures as well as ad-hoc measures against hostile bids identified and evaluated for their anti-takeover effectiveness. A hostile takeover in Slovenia usually involves a hostile public tender offer at a substantial premium over the prevailing market price for a substantial percentage of the target company’s <b>stock.</b> <b>Managers</b> of target companies use in takeover battles a variety of defensive tactics, which could be controversial because they pose a conflict of interest for management.
