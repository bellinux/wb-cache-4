25|$|Usually otter {{trawlers}} {{have the}} superstructure forward, {{though it can}} be aft or amidship. Gallows are on the stern quarters or there is a <b>stern</b> <b>gantry</b> for operating the otter boards. Pelagic trawlers can use fish pumps to empty the cod end.|$|E
50|$|Bell M. Shimada has an oceanographic winch with {{a maximum}} pull weight of 6,800 pounds (3,084 kg) which can deploy up to 5,100 meters (16,732 feet) of 16-mm wire. She also has two hydrographic winches {{with a maximum}} pull weight of 2,600 pounds (1,179 kg), each of which can deploy 3,600 meters (11,811 feet) of 9.5-mm wire, two trawl winches with a maximum pull weight of 7,200 pounds (3,266 kg), each of which can deploy 4,300 meters (14,107 feet) of 28.6-mm wire, and a {{hydraulic}} third-wire winch which can deploy 4,700 meters (15,420 feet) of 11.4-mm electromechanical cable. She has a 67-foot (20.4-meter) knuckle boom and a 60-foot (18.3-meter) telescopic boom. She has a movable A-frame on her starboard side with a maximum safe working load of 2,979 pounds (1,351 kg) and a large movable A-frame aft with a maximum safe working load of 22,000 pounds (9,979 kg) {{that serves as a}} <b>stern</b> <b>gantry.</b> The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while two winches work with the starboard-side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and Bell M. Shimadas configuration allows her to have three scientific packages ready for sequential operations. One of her winches also can deploy lines and equipment over her stern. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps. Her winches can deploy CTD instruments to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence of sea water. Bell M. Shimada also can deploy specialized gear such as Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) frames, towed vehicles, dredges, and bottom corers, and she can deploy and recover both floating and bottom-moored sensor arrays. While trawling, Reuben Lasker uses wireless and hard-wired systems to monitor the shape of the trawl net and to work in conjunction with an autotrawl system that sets trawl depth and trawl wire tension and adjusts the net configuration.|$|E
50|$|Reuben Lasker has a traction-type oceanographic winch with {{a maximum}} pull weight of 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) which can deploy up to 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 17.3-mm (0..681-inch) {{electromechanical}} cable. She also has two CTD winches {{with a maximum}} pull weight of 7,700 pounds (3,493 kg), each of which can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 9.5-mm (.375-inch) electromechanical cable, two trawl winches with a maximum pull weight of 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg), each of which can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 25.4-mm (1-inch) wire, and a net sonde winch with a maximum pull weight of 8,100 pounds (3,674 kg) which can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 11.4-mm (.450-inch) electromechanical wire. She has a 65-foot (19.8-meter) telescopic boom with a lifting capacity of 1,000 pounds (454 kg) at full extension and of 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) when extended 23 feet (7 meters) and a 23-foot (7-meter) telescopic boom with a 1,000-pound (454 kg) lifting capacity. She has a movable A-frame on her starboard side with a maximum safe working load of 2,000 pounds (907 kg) and a large A-frame aft with a maximum safe working load of 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg) {{that serves as a}} <b>stern</b> <b>gantry.</b> The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while two winches work with the starboard-side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and Reuben Laskers configuration allows her to have three scientific packages ready for sequential operations.
