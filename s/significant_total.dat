50|$|Arkansas was won by President Bill Clinton (D-AR) by a 17 {{percentage}} point margin of victory. The {{presidential election in}} the Natural State was a critical victory for the Democratic ticket, because Arkansas is Clinton's home state. Dole did not put up a challenge in Arkansas, and neither did billionaire businessman Ross Perot (Ref-TX), who had unsuccessfully run for president as an Independent in the previous election. Perot in 1996 won 7.9 {{percent of the popular}} vote in the Natural State, a <b>significant</b> <b>total</b> for a third party candidate.

The presidential election in the Peach state was the third closest contest that year in any state with only Kentucky and Nevada being closer. Dole's victory was possible due to the declining support for Democrats in Georgia and many other Southeastern States, though the Democratic Party in Georgia would remain a significant institution until the early 2000s (decade). Billionaire businessman Ross Perot (Ref-TX), who had unsuccessfully run for president as an Independent in the previous election, won 6.4% {{of the popular vote}} in the Peach state, a <b>significant</b> <b>total</b> for a third party candidate.

Antioxidant activities were evaluated by using DPPH radical scavenging and β-carotene-linoleic acid bleaching and compared with ascorbic acid, BHA and BHT used as reference compounds. The most <b>significant</b> <b>total</b> phenolic content was of 252. 50 ± 7. 02 mg of gallic acid equivalent/g for CHCl 3 extract from A. dolichocarpa, which presented the best antioxidant activity (IC 50 55. 64 ± 5. 24 µg/ml) for DPPH scavenging. For D. chrysocarpa, the more <b>significant</b> <b>total</b> phenolic content was of 213. 11 ± 9. 87 for AcOEt extract, with IC 50 value of 26. 97 ± 1. 90 µg/ml for DPPH scavenging.
