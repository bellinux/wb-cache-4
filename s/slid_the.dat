5|$|Arsenal {{began to}} play with purpose once going behind, {{but for the rest}} of the half {{struggled}} to get the better of Luton's defence. A long ball by Davis sent Rocastle charging forward in the 16th minute, and momentarily upset Luton's shape, but it was caught by Dibble. The Luton goalkeeper was again called into action when Arsenal were awarded a set piece; Sansom <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> ball to Nigel Winterburn, whose shot was gathered. Foster made a timely challenge on Davis on the edge of the penalty area to end another Arsenal attack; Graham's team had been more threatening on right-hand flank with Rocastle and Winterburn. Harford, who had been a long figure up front for Luton, still managed to trouble the Arsenal defence with little service; near the end of the first half, he collected a pass from the left, bypassed his marker Adams and aimed his shot at goal, which went wide of the right-hand post.|$|E
25|$|Schwantz and Gardner went {{at it for}} 2nd place. Mamola almost highsided {{trying to}} impress the crowd, a bit later on a {{left-hander}} he {{looked over his shoulder}} and immediately <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> bike into a highside. Schwantz will do something similar next year at Phillip Island. Rainey retired with a punctured tire.|$|E
25|$|Next, Parma {{travelled}} to relegation-threatened Novara, {{where they}} had never won in fifteen previous attempts. Parma had the better {{of the first half}} and perhaps should have twice opened the scoring earlier than they did through Graziano Pellè, but the goal did come on the half-hour mark when Biabiany <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> ball across the area to find Novara defender Matteo Centurioni, who put the ball his own net. Novara then came into the game and were rewarded after 70 minutes, when Raffaele Rubino scored a typical header from close range to become the first player to score goals in the top 4 levels of Italian football at the same club. Novara then doubled Parma's pain 8 minutes later with a Marco Rigoni header. A late Giuseppe Gemiti sending-off and a 200th Parma appearance for Hernán Crespo were not enough to give Parma a way back into the game, as Novara won their first match in nine.|$|E

25|$|It took {{eight to}} twenty hours in soft soil or gravel to {{excavate}} the large firing pit required {{to hold the}} halves of the base box. Six to eight hours were required to actually assemble the gun itself. Each half of the base box was maneuvered into position on rails that ran along {{each side of the}} pit and then it was jacked up off the wagon and the wagon was then removed. Each base box half was jacked down onto wheels that ran on the guide rails and then they were bolted together. The complete base box was pulled over the pit, the wheels removed and it was jacked down into the pit. Three rails were placed on top of the base box to guide the carriage wagon into position and the carriage was jacked up while the wagon was removed and it was then jacked down and bolted to the base box. The barrel wagon was guided into place using the same rails and two block and tackles were attached to the barrel clamp. The crew pulled on the ropes and <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> barrel into the cradle. The last steps were to connect the recoil brakes' pistons to the barrel, fill and test the recoil brake and recuperator, and install the roller race. Disassembly took around six hours.|$|E
25|$|By 2:15a.m., Lightoller, Moody {{and others}} were {{struggling}} to retrieve Collapsible Boats A and B from their places of storage {{on the roof of}} the officers' quarters. They rigged up makeshift ramps from oars and spars down which they <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> boats onto the Boat Deck. Unfortunately for all concerned, the boat broke through the ramp and landed upside-down on the deck. It reached the Boat Deck upside-down but there was no time to right it as Titanic began her final break-up and plunge to the seabed. Water swept across the Boat Deck, washing the upside-down lifeboat and many people into the sea. Wireless operator Harold Bride found himself trapped underneath the overturned hull. Titanics increasing angle in the water and an opening expansion joint caused the stays supporting the forward funnel to snap and crash into the water, crushing swimmers in its path and pushing Collapsible B away from the sinking ship. As Titanic went under, the lifeboat was left in the midst of hundreds of people swimming in the water. Several dozen people climbed onto its hull, including Lightoller, who then took charge of it. Also aboard were Jack Thayer (whose mother was saved with her maid in Boat #4, but whose father died), military historian Colonel Archibald Gracie, who later wrote a popular account of the disaster, and Chief Baker Charles Joughin. Bride managed to escape from the air pocket beneath the boat and made it onto the hull.|$|E
25|$|A week later, at the {{beginning}} of March, Stevenage won their second away game on the bounce; beating Eastbourne Borough 60. Captain Mark Roberts gave Stevenage the lead just before the break, following a well-worked free-kick involving both Joel Byrom and Scott Laird. After the interval, Stevenage doubled their lead when David Bridges headed in Joel Byrom's cross. It was three shortly after following a mistake from Eastbourne goalkeeper Danny Knowles, Chris Beardsley blocked the goalkeepers clearance and <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> ball into an empty net. It got worse for the home side ten minutes from time when Beardsley chased a long through ball and was hauled down by Darren Baker just inside the area - the defender being shown a straight red. Substitute Mitchell Cole slotted the penalty home, before adding another after good work from Eddie Odhiambo. Cole completed his hat-trick moments later slotting home Stacy Long's through ball. A third successive victory followed in a 20 win at home to Crawley Town. In a tight game, Stevenage took the lead just after the interval thanks to a rasping effort from Michael Bostwick after a well-worked corner. A second goal came deep into injury-time, Chris Beardsley countering and setting up Lee Boylan to slide the ball into the net. Three days later, Stevenage beat Barrow 40 to ensure a fourth consecutive win. In a tight first half, the home side took the lead through Yemi Odubade. Borough doubled their lead shortly before the interval; left-back Scott Laird firing the ball home. Odubade then scored his second after countering a Barrow corner, and subsequently completed his hat-trick late on with an effort drilled high into the net. Stevenage recorded their fifth straight win, beating Histon 10 at Broadhall Way. Jon Ashton scored the only goal of the game when he swept home Stacy Long's corner.|$|E

500|$|After {{improving}} to 33goals in {{his first}} full season, Fleury broke out in 1990–91, scoring 51 goals and 104 points to lead the Flames offensively. He played in the 1991 All-Star Game, scoring a goal in an 11–5 victory by the Campbell Conference over the Wales Conference. [...] Towards {{the end of the}} season, Fleury set a league record by scoring three shorthanded goals in one game against the St. Louis Blues. He shared the NHL Plus-Minus Award with Marty McSorley, whom he tied for the league lead with +48. [...] Fleury scored only two goals in the 1991 Stanley Cup Playoffs, but after his overtime winner in game six against the Oilers he famously <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> entire length of the ice in jubilation before crashing into the boards as his teammates attempted to catch up to him. The Flames were defeated in game seven, which ended their season.|$|E

The second verse of the song is half-rapped by her. Jay-Z later appears to provide his rapped verse as he compares his relationship with Beyoncé to that of Ike and Tina Turner. He forgoes subtlety as he raps, [...] "Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol/ <b>Slid</b> <b>the</b> panties right to the side/ Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight... your breasteses is my breakfast". Similarly to Beyoncé, Jay-Z sings about the places they have had sex in their house.

500|$|Arsenal then {{travelled}} to the Reebok Stadium to play Bolton on 20 December 2003, {{the setting}} where their title challenge faltered eight months ago. Although they again picked {{up just a}} point, Wenger believed it was a useful one: [...] "Provided Bolton keep playing like that, we will look back at this result and feel very happy. They {{are as good as}} a team as we have played." [...] On Boxing Day, Henry scored twice for Arsenal in a 3–0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three days later, the team played Southampton. The only goal of the match came in the first half: Henry's through pass found Pirès [...] "who <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> ball beneath the exposed Antti Niemi". The win meant Arsenal had gone half the season without losing and the team according to The Times had begun to [...] "establish an aura of invincibility". Arsenal ended the calendar year in second place, with 45 points from 19 matches. They were one point behind leaders Manchester United and three ahead of Chelsea.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, {{the city}} council voted to replace all {{existing}} T1000 and T1300 stock with the MX3000, increasing the quantity by another 30 units. With the second order, the price had increased to NOK2.5 billion. Two test units were delivered in October 2005, and the serial production started in April 2006, with the first deliveries in April 2007. With the delivery of the new trains, Oslo Sporveier received criticism {{that they had been}} disloyal to the old red color of the metro, and that they did not follow up on their former design concept from the 1960s through the 80s. During the first 30 days, there occurred two errors: one in the closing mechanism of the doors, and one with a switch in the cab that was not water tight. However, it turned out that Oslo Sporveier had not been accurate enough in specifying the energy consumption of the trains, and the rectifiers on parts of the line needed to be upgraded to supply sufficient power to the trains. During 2007, there were four incidents where the trains were not able to brake at stations. The worst incident occurred when a train <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> [...] from Blindern to Majorstuen.|$|E
500|$|Stage 14 was {{the last}} in the {{mountains}} of Ardeche, before travelling to Monte Carlo for the Super Special Stage.

500|$|Federal troops {{combed the}} rural area's woods and swamps for Booth {{in the days}} {{following}} the assassination, as the nation experienced an outpouring of grief. On April 18, mourners waited seven abreast in a mile-long line outside the White House for the public viewing of the slain president, reposing in his open walnut casket in the black-draped East Room. A cross of lilies was at the head and roses covered the coffin's lower half. Thousands of mourners arriving on special trains jammed Washington for the next day's funeral, sleeping on hotel floors and even resorting to blankets spread outdoors on the Capitol's lawn. Prominent abolitionist leader and orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an [...] "unspeakable calamity" [...] for African Americans. Great indignation was directed towards Booth as the assassin's identity was telegraphed across the nation. Newspapers called him an [...] "accursed devil," [...] "monster," [...] "madman," [...] and a [...] "wretched fiend." [...] Historian Dorothy Kunhardt writes: [...] "Almost every family who kept a photograph album on the parlor table owned a likeness of John Wilkes Booth of the famous Booth family of actors. After the assassination Northerners <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> Booth card out of their albums: some threw it away, some burned it, some crumpled it angrily." [...] Even in the South, sorrow was expressed in some quarters. In Savannah, Georgia, the mayor and city council addressed a vast throng at an outdoor gathering to express their indignation, and many in the crowd wept. Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston called Booth's act [...] "a disgrace to the age". Robert E. Lee also expressed regret at Lincoln's death by Booth's hand.|$|E

2500|$|Fischer makes several {{atmospheric}} {{observations about}} his opponent's habits and {{reaction to his}} moves.

[...] "Poker-faced as always Keres made this move as though it was the most natural one on the board" [...] (Game 37).

She later brought a letter from a peasant couple (a Mr. and Mrs. Hiecques), who promised to shelter him outside St. Omer until he could be passed further down the line. Until then, their son would wait outside the hospital every night until there was a chance of escape. Eventually, he escaped out of a window. The plan worked initially. Bader completed the long walk to the safe house despite wearing a British uniform. Unfortunately for him, the plan was betrayed by another woman at the hospital. He hid in the garden when a German staff car arrived at the house, but was found later. Bader denied that the couple had known he was there. They, along with the French woman at the hospital, were sent for forced labour in Germany. The couple survived. After the war, French authorities sentenced the woman informer to 20 years in prison.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>SLID</b> also {{includes}} information on age, household composition, province of residence, and sector of activity. However, {{it has a}} shortcoming in {{that it does not}} include information on the consumption of goods and services. To obtain detailed information on expenditures we turn to the 2003 Survey of Households Spending (SHS), which lacks detailed information on income sources, and employ matching techniques (see Abadie et al. 2001) to impute consumption vectors (products) to <b>the</b> <b>SLID</b> economic families 16. First, for a given <b>SLID</b> observation <b>the</b> matching generates total consumption as a function of specified household characteristics (e.g., adjusted adult-equivalent after-tax income, size, age of reference person, province and size of region of residence) in both <b>the</b> <b>SLID</b> and <b>the</b> SHS. Second, total expenditure is then disaggregated into the consumption of various goods and services assuming that <b>the</b> <b>SLID</b> family has <b>the</b> same preferences as its analogous (match) family in the SHS. Finally, as a measure of robustness of the results, we compared the estimated distribution of total consumption (generated by the matching procedure) to the observed SHS distribution by computing several income distribution indices. The similarity of both the shape of the distributions and the various statistical indices supports the outcomes of the procedure employed. Indeed, the differences in low-income rates and Gini indices computed with the two distributions are found to be less than one percentage point.|$|R
