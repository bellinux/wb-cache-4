It was supported by Brunel and a large quantity of documentary evidence. Objections from local landowners were handled by including clauses in the Parrett Navigation Act to ensure that <b>surplus</b> <b>water</b> would be channelled to the Long Sutton Catchwater Drain by culverts, siphons, and sluices, and the Act of Parliament was passed on 4 July 1836.|$|E

The lock at Lea Bridge was removed, and replaced by Old Ford Lock further to the south, which was built to take 100-ton barges, rather than the 40-ton barges specified by an Act of 1805. Although the original Lee trustees, and after 1868 the Conservators of the River Lee, were officially responsible for the Bow Back Rivers, there was little incentive to maintain them, since they did not generate any revenue.

5|$|The docks {{maintenance}} {{facility was}} established {{on the land}} exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour and remains sited at this location to the present day. William Jessop had created a weir in the dam at Underfall to allow <b>surplus</b> <b>water</b> to flow back into the New Cut, this {{was known as the}} 'Overfall'. By the 1830s, the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, however, able to devise a solution to this problem. In place of the Overfall he advised better use of three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel. This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls. When the deep sluice opened at low tide, a powerful undertow sucked the silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide. The shallow sluices enabled adjustment of the dock water level according to weather conditions.|$|E

When originally built, the chamber was very long, and both companies installed a set of lock gates, enabling them both to collect tolls. Each company built a cottage overlooking the locks, the Macclesfield Canal constructing theirs of stone, while the Trent and Mersey used brick. A long overflow above the locks channels <b>surplus</b> <b>water</b> to the Trent and Mersey Canal, as stipulated by the amendment to the 1827 Act.

From 1955, a programme of draining the canal, laying pipes along its bed and filling it in began. The section from Derby Road to Radford Bridge Road, including locks 4 and 5, was completed in 1955, and by 1962, had reached lock 12 on the Wollaton flight. Lock 13 was adapted to feed <b>surplus</b> <b>water</b> into the pipes. Wollaton Colliery continued to use the canal to discharge water from the colliery bathhouse until its closure in late 1963, and once it had closed, the section up to lock 19 was drained and culverted in 1966. On 23 September 1964, a section of the top pound was drained, between Trowell and Wollaton, and {{a large portion of the}} remainder, between Awsworth and Bailey Grove, was subsequently destroyed by opencast coal mining.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of suspended solids, nutrients, and organic matter loads in drainage water from paddy fields {{is an important}} issue for water quality management in closed water areas in Japan. We evaluated the ability of cyclic irrigation to reduce the suspended solids load from paddy fields. In 2006 and 2007, we investigated water and mass balances during the irrigation period in a low-lying paddy-field district neighboring Lake Biwa, which is the largest lake in Japan. We confirmed that cyclic irrigation reduced effluent loads during the puddling season. With cyclic irrigation, 118 kg ha− 1 of suspended solids was returned to the paddy fields in 2006 and 199 kg ha− 1 in 2007. The effect of cyclic irrigation on the net suspended solids load can be represented by three ratios: the concentration ratio, which represents the ratio of the suspended solids concentration in drainage water to that in lake water; the cyclic irrigation ratio, which represents the ratio of the volume of reused water to that of irrigation water in cyclic irrigation; and the <b>surplus</b> irrigation <b>water</b> ratio, which represents the ratio of the volume of <b>surplus</b> irrigation <b>water</b> to that of irrigation water. The cyclic irrigation ratio and the <b>surplus</b> irrigation <b>water</b> ratio interact to determine the effect of cyclic irrigation on the net suspended solids load.
