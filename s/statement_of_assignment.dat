40|$|The present paper {{contains}} a new result on {{the combination of}} Hoare logic and Scott's induction rule, obtained by taking the specification statement ϕψ as basic <b>statement</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>assignments</b> [...] -here ϕ and ψ stand for recursively enumerable first order assertions. This result owes its significance to EdR:mfcs 96, in which the general case of data refinement is shown to be expressible using specification statements. Consequently the resulting Hoare logic enables data refinement proofs, and the interesting question arises to which extent this logic can be simplified without sacrificing completeness. We present a rather simple sound and relatively complete logic in which the recursion rule {{does not require a}} deduction in its antecedent, in contrast to all but one formulation of Scott's induction rule, namely the one by Jerald Schwarz Schwarz 77...|$|R

S. Constitution effectively makes campus speech codes illegal (Bronner 1997 : 489 – 490). They are also legally ineffective (Bronner 1997 : 494). M. I. T. instituted a speech code to help prevent sexual harassment, but the code turned out to have many unwanted consequences. Even its designers rejected it (Bronner 1997 : 492). One could argue that the language that speech codes seek to regulate falls outside the bounds of the First Amendment. This argument would not, though, address the fact that speech codes are an artificial tool for solving problems stemming from social inequality (Bronner 1997 : 492). The argument is also dubious (Bronner 1997 : 493) ...|$|R

From an account given to the interrogators, it was obvious that the FA received a vast amount of material, processed it and sent it to those people and organizations who could make the most use of it. The level of co-operation with other German cryptologic agencies is difficult to estimate. Certainly the <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> individuals employed by the different agencies as regard FA, were defeatist in tone. Both the other agencies and the FA complained that they knew little of the each other's operational counterparts with the other agencies personnel stating that the FA personnel were standoffish and exclusive.
