40|$|<b>Sheet</b> <b>silicates</b> (e. g. micas and clays) are {{important}} constituents {{of a wide}} variety of geological formations such as granite, basalt, and sandstone. <b>Sheet</b> <b>silicates,</b> particularly clays such as bentonite are common materials in near-field engineered barriers in high-level nuclear waste (HLW) repositories. This is because migration of radionuclides from an underground HLW repository to the geosphere may be significantly reduced by sorption of radionuclides (e. g., Pu, U and Np) onto <b>sheet</b> <b>silicates</b> (e. g., clays and micas) that line the fractures and pores of the rocks along groundwater flowpaths. In addition to surface sorption, it has been suggested that some <b>sheet</b> <b>silicates</b> may also be able to incorporate many radionuclides, such as Cs and Sr, in the inter-layer sites of the sheet structure. However, theability of the <b>sheet</b> <b>silicates</b> to incorporate radionuclides and retard release and migration of radionuclides may be significantly affected by the near-field radiation due to the decay of fission products and actinides. for example, the unique properties of the sheet structures will be lost completely if the structure becomes amorphous due to irradiation effects. Thus, the study of irradiation effects on sheet-structures, such as structural damage and modification of chemical properties, are critical to the performance assessment of long-term repository behavior. ...|$|R

50|$|Silicate {{structures}} {{are the most}} variable among all of the structures discussed. A common silicate structure consists of a hexagonal array of cylinders whose length {{is parallel to the}} x-axis of the olivine and the side of the hexagonal cell is parallel to the z-axis of olivine.

5000|$|Siliciclastic {{sedimentary}} rocks {{are composed of}} mainly silicate particles derived by the weathering of older rocks and pyroclastic volcanism. While grain size, clast and cementing material (matrix) composition, and texture are important factors when regarding composition, siliciclastic {{sedimentary rocks}} are classified according to grain size into three major categories; conglomerates, sandstones, and mudrocks. The term clay is used to classify particles smaller than [...]0039 millimeters. However, term {{can also be used}} to refer to a family of <b>sheet</b> <b>silicate</b> minerals. Silt refers to particles that have a diameter between [...]062 and [...]0039 millimeters. The term mud is used when clay and silt particles are mixed in the sediment; mudrock is the name of the rock created with these sediments. Furthermore, particles that reach diameters between [...]062 and 2 millimeters fall into the category of sand. When sand is cemented together and lithified it becomes known as sandstone. Any particle that is larger than two millimeters is considered gravel. This category includes pebbles, cobbles and boulders. Like sandstone, when gravels are lithified they are considered conglomerates.|$|E
40|$|A {{wide variety}} of intergrowth microstructures have been {{observed}} with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy in eight different pyroxene specimens that have been partially or wholly altered to other minerals. The product phases ofthe alteration reactions include amphibole, clinojimthompsonite, chain-width disordered pyribole, and several sheet silicates. Textural considerations indicate {{that there are a}} number of different paths for pyroxene hydration reactions. These include the simple paths pyroxene [...] + amphibole, pyroxene-+ clinojimthompsonite, and pyroxene-+ <b>sheet</b> <b>silicate,</b> as well as more complicated, stepwise paths, such as pyroxene-> amphibole-+ <b>sheet</b> <b>silicate</b> and pyroxene [...] -> clinojimthompsonite-+ <b>sheet</b> <b>silicate.</b> In some cases, multiple reaction paths are observed in the same specimen. The microstructures indicate that in addition to multiple paths for reaction, there may be multiple mechanisms by which a specific reaction may occur. For example, replacement of pyroxene by amphibole or other hydrous pyriboles can take place either by the nucleation and growth of narrow lamellae of the product mineral, or by a bulk replacement mechanism along a broad reaction front. Replacement of pyroxene by amphibole takes place in such a way that multiple nucleation events may result i...|$|E

40|$|A carbon-rich acid residue {{from the}} Allende {{carbonaceous}} chondrite was examined by high-resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HRTEM) and also by analytical electron microscopy. A TEM mount of this residue that has previously been reported to contain carbyne forms of carbon was shown to contain <b>sheet</b> <b>silicate</b> contaminants.

In view of these observations {{it is suggested that}} identifications of carbyne by electron diffraction should be supported by microanalyses of the individual grains.

40|$|Iron {{speciation}} {{was determined}} in hemiplegic sediments {{from a high}} productivity area to investigate systematically the early diagenetic reactivity of Fe. A combination of various leaching agents (1 M HCI, dithionite buffered in citrate/acetic acid, HF/H 2 SO 4, acetic Cr(II)) was applied to sediment and extracted more than 80 % of total Fe. Subsequent Fe species determination defined specific mineral fractions that are available for Fe reduction and fractions formed as products of Fe diagenesis. To determine the Fe speciation of (<b>sheet)</b> <b>silicates</b> we explored an extraction procedure (HF/H 2 SO 4) and verified the procedure by application to standard rocks. Variations of Fe speciation of (<b>sheet)</b> <b>silicates</b> reflect the possible formation of Fe-bearing silicates in near surface sediments. The same fraction indicates {{a change in the}} primary input at greater depth, which is supported by other parameters. The Fe(II) / Fe(III) -ratio of total sediment determined by extractions was compared with Mössbauer-spectroscopy] at room temperature and showed agreement within 10 %. M 6 ssbauer-spectroscopy indicates the occurrence of siderite in the presence of free sulfide and pyrite, supporting the importance of microenvironments during mineral formation.

The sample also contains quartz, albite, lawsonite, and rutile. The subassemblage albite-lawsonite-rutile requires metamorphic conditions on the low-temperature side of the equilibrium albite+lawsonite+rutile=paragonite+sphene+quartz+H 2 O (T< 200 ° C and P< 7. 4 kbars based on thermodynamic data of Holland and Powell 1990). The white micas appear to be optically homogeneous, but back-scattered electron images can distinguish two different micas by their slight difference in contrast. Electron microprobe analyses (EMPA) of micas show Na/(Na+K) ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 8. The two micas are resolved by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as packets of phengite and paragonite that range from 20 to several hundred nm in thickness. The compositions, determined by analytical electron microscopy (AEM), constrain the limbs of the phengite-paragonite solvus to values of Na/(Na+K) =< 0. 02 and 0. 97, representing less mutual solid solution than ever reported by EMPA. The textural relations imply that the <b>sheet</b> <b>silicates</b> were derived from reactions between fluids and detrital clays and that they are in an intermediate stage of textural development.
