40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{assessment}} {{of the effect of}} government's economic liberalization policy on the flow of commercial banks <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> <b>farmers</b> in Rivers State. The empirical analyses are based on information obtained from a sample of 25 out of the over 30 commercial banks operating in the State. Results from the analyses indicate that despite the deregulation of interest rates associated with economic liberalization, commercial banks in the State are unable to meet one-half of the loan requests of farmers. The flow of loanable funds can therefore not be said to have been enhanced by interest rates deregulation. It is argued that simply re-moving restrictions on interest rates is not a sufficient condition for enhanced flow of commercial bank <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> <b>farmers</b> in the State. Such a policy must be complemented with programmes of sharing initial risks and administrative costs between government and the private sector...|$|R

This paper examines the trend and pattern of bank <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> smallholder <b>farmers</b> in South Africa, {{both before and after}} the attainment of democratic government. The analysis of the trend and pattern of bank <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> smallholder <b>farmers</b> was conducted within the confines of the same agricultural sector, across all economy sectors and in relation to GDP. Our analyses show that bank <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> smallholder <b>farmers</b> is (and continues to be) a small fraction of total <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> the private sector and is a very small proportion of GDP. The smallholder farmer sector is observed to face the same constraints <b>to</b> <b>credit</b> as SMEs, a category of enterprises to which they also belong. In light of the importance of agriculture, in general, and smallholder <b>farmers,</b> in particular, <b>to</b> South Africaâ€™s poverty alleviation and food security drive, our results have important policy implications.

50|$|One {{possible}} {{motivation for}} fiscal pedaling is political advantage, {{in that it}} permits a government to conceal the true extent of its fiscal obligations during a political campaign.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to measure subsidies <b>to</b> agricultural <b>credit</b> {{in recent years}} and provides policy implications. It finds that credit policy has evolved, from provision of subsidized <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> one that is more market-oriented, focusing on providing access <b>to</b> <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> <b>farmers</b> while exposing them to market interest rates. Nevertheless, there remains a significant public outlay for credit largely through unintended default subsidy. It recommends that publicly supported credit be provided solely through competent government financial institutions under independent regulatory oversight, rather than through agencies (such as the Agricultural Credit Enhancement Fund) or through government-owned and controlled corporations (such as QUEDANCOR). Government may also need to invest in other support services that would attenuate agricultural risk and encourage greater private sector participation in agricultural lending...|$|R
50|$|Clemente de Faria founded Banco da Lavoura de Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state, on 16 June 1925.

30|$|Proximity {{to markets}} reduces {{the cost of}} {{acquiring}} inputs and selling outputs, thus increasing the profitability of technology adoption. <b>Farmers</b> closer <b>to</b> agricultural markets {{are more likely to}} use modern inputs since transaction costs (lower transportation and information-gathering costs) are lower.
