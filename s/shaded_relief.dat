40|$|Utilization of {{airborne}} laser scanning {{data for the}} detection of agrarian forms of relief in the Giant Mountains Abstract This thesis deals with the possible use {{of airborne}} laser scanning data {{for the detection of}} agrarian forms of relief in the Giant Mountains. The main research method is the analy- sis of the digital terrain model and digital surface model {{in the area of the}} Giant Mountains in the software ArcGIS 10. 0. The analysis is based on specific functions in ArcGIS software (Slope, Curvature) as well as on combinations of rasters of <b>shaded</b> <b>reliefs</b> which led to the detection of further agrarian forms. To verify the precision of agrarian forms detection field verification was used. Based on verification and accuracy assessment the results can be designated as a very satisfactory. The Administration of the Giant Moun- tains National Park can use the research results to quantify the agrarian forms of relief, to improve their protection and, possibly also for further research and management.

40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to provide an {{overview}} of recent developments in the fields of small-scale and multiscale relief mapping. Hypsometric tinting, <b>relief</b> <b>shading,</b> continuous color <b>shading,</b> plan oblique <b>relief</b> and other techniques are widely used for maps covering large territories at small scales. The main difference between these techniques and large-scale terrain cartography is that the representations become highly abstract at the observational scale and thus require a high level of generalization. At very small scales, the terrain is stylized to convey distinctive geographic and morphological features. The positional accuracy of valleys and mountain chains becomes less important, and terrain features are depicted as abstracted symbols at the smallest scales. Thus, two main topics are of interest in this chapter: the automation of representation techniques and the generalization of digital elevation models. We focus on both small-scale and multi-scale mapping, which are interrelated because related generalization techniques are specific to the representation techniques. The following sections first discuss general requirements for digital terrain generalization at small scales, then discuss terrain visualization with (a) traditional <b>relief</b> <b>shading</b> and plan oblique relief, (b) continuous color shading and (c) hypsometric tinting...|$|R
40|$|Ocean and terra are {{the largest}} geomorphologic units on the earth, and there are {{essential}} differences between them. Hence, while we make the geomorphologic <b>relief</b> <b>shading</b> map, {{it is necessary to}} make the ocean/terrestrial geomorphologic <b>relief</b> <b>shading</b> map respectively. Then combining the ocean and terra map, we can get a whole geomorphologic map about the study area. However, the SRTM-DEM(Shuttle Radar Topography Mission-Digital Elevation Model) we get from USGS(United States Geological Survey) is clipped by SWBD(Shorelines and Water Bodies Database) coastline, so the coastline may be not accordance with the coastline we get about the study area. To solve this problem, we had to clip the DEM and patch the void data. Only in this way can we assure the DEM is accordance with the coastline. If the DEM is larger than the coastline, we can cut the spare parts by using the tool - extract by mask. However, if the DEM is smaller than the coastline, we have to patch the void data. This paper tries to find the best interpolating method to patch the void area according to the geomorphologic units. After that, we illustrate the processes of how to make the geomorphologic <b>relief</b> <b>shading</b> map by the software - Global Mapper...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the selection of}} a set of geostatistical coefficients suitable for a unified SRTM data refinement from 3 &# 8243; to 1 &# 8243; through kriging over the entire Brazilian territory. This selection aimed at data potential for geomorphometric derivations, given by the preservation of detailed geometric characteristics of the resulting digital elevation models (DEM), which are sensitive to refining procedures. The development contained a long-term experimentation stage, when data refinement through kriging was locally developed to support distinct regional projects, followed by a unified selection stage, where the acquired experience was applied to select a single and unified interpolation scheme. In this stage, the selected geostatistical models with promising performances were tested for unified refinement on 40 Brazilian areas with distinct geological settings. Tested areas encompass reliefs varying from mountainous to plain. The effects of data preparation were observed on the perception of patterns (texture and roughness), as well as of singularities (edges, peaks, thalwegs etc.). Results were evaluated mainly through the examination of <b>shaded</b> <b>reliefs,</b> transects and perspectives observed in different scales. Terrains with low slopes and small amplitudes had their DEM promptly affected by the refining methods, as opposed to mountainous terrains. The evaluation, unambiguously confirmed by all consulted interpreters, converged into a refining model with outstanding performance in all tested conditions. Pages: 300 - 30...|$|R

40|$|With full-waveform (FWF) lidar systems {{becoming}} increasingly available from different commercial manufacturers, {{the possibility for}} extracting physical parameters of the scanned surfaces in an area-wide sense, as addendum to their geometric representation, has risen as well. The mentioned FWF systems digitize the temporal profiles of the transmitted laser pulse and of its backscattered echoes, allowing for a reliable determination of the target distance to the instrument and of physical target quantities by means of radiometric calibration, one of such quantities being the diffuse Lambertian reflectance. The delineation of glaciers is a time-consuming task, commonly performed manually by experts and involving field trips as well as image interpretation of orthophotos, digital terrain models and <b>shaded</b> <b>reliefs.</b> In this study, the diffuse Lambertian reflectance was compared to the glacier outlines mapped by experts. We start the presentation with the workflow for analysis of FWF data, their direct georeferencing and the calculation of the diffuse Lambertian reflectance by radiometric calibration; this workflow is illustrated for a large FWF lidar campaign in the Ötztal Alps (Tyrol, Austria), operated with an Optech ALTM 3100 system. The geometric performance of the presented procedure was evaluated {{by means of a}} relative and an absolute accuracy assessment using strip differences and orthophotos, resp.

40|$|ABSTRACT] We studied {{relationship}} between lineament density extraction from satellite image and earthquake distribution using remote sensing applications. The {{result of this}} study aim {{to set up a}} complete earthquake hazard Map. The selected area is located in the Taungtonelone area，northern Mynmar. Myanmar is an earth-quake-prone country. It lies in a major earthquake zone of the world called Mediterranean -Himalayan belt. As the major urban areas in Myanmar lie in earthquake prone zones, earthquake hazard reduction progrram is needed. Seismic monitoring and seismic database in Myanmar is in the early stage of developing. The current seismic hazard map of Mynmar is based on historical seismicity. Thus, there is a pressing need to prepare national seismic hazard maps for earthquake. Tectonic faults are often associated with characteristic geo-morphological features such as linear valleys, ridgelines and slope breaks that can be identified as lineaments in remotely sensed images of digital elevation models. A lineament map was prepared using stereo pair image of ASTER image, Landsat 7 ETM+ image, SRTM DEM image. A variety of image processing techniques were used to highlight linear features of images. Known techniques such as color composite, Pseudo color DEM <b>shade</b> <b>relief</b> and 3 D stereo anaglyph have been applied to enhance images for visual interpretation. The lineament reflects the geological structures such as faults or fractures. All lineament frequencies and lengths per unit area are calculated and combined to generate lineament density map. A grid system was used to obtain the data for lineament density values. This analysis produced a map showing concentrations of the lineaments over the area. The lineament density map can be used for the quantitative evaluation between lineaments and the earthquake risks monitoring for the future...|$|R
