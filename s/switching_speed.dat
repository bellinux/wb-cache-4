25|$|Quasi-adiabatic switching, however, {{requires}} that the tunneling barriers of a cell be switched relatively slowly compared to the intrinsic <b>switching</b> <b>speed</b> of a QCA. This prevents ringing and metastable states observed when cells are switched abruptly. Therefore, the <b>switching</b> <b>speed</b> of a QCA is limited not {{by the time it}} takes for a cell to change polarization, but by the appropriate quasi-adiabatic switching time of the clocks being used.|$|E

25|$|Practical devices {{capable of}} {{operating}} {{over an extended}} current range were first reported by Baliga et al. in 1982. A similar paper was also submitted by J. P. Russel et al. to IEEE Electron Device Letter in 1982. The applications for the device were initially regarded by the power electronics community to be severely restricted by its slow <b>switching</b> <b>speed</b> and latch-up of the parasitic thyristor structure inherent within the device. However, it was demonstrated by Baliga and also by A. M. Goodman et al. in 1983 that the <b>switching</b> <b>speed</b> could be adjusted over a broad range by using electron irradiation. This was followed by demonstration of operation of the device at elevated temperatures by Baliga in 1985. Successful efforts to suppress the latch-up of the parasitic thyristor and the scaling of the voltage rating of the devices at GE allowed the introduction of commercial devices in 1983, which could be utilized {{for a wide variety}} of applications.|$|E

25|$|FETs {{often have}} a very low 'on' {{resistance}} and have a high 'off' resistance. However the intermediate resistances are significant, and so FETs can dissipate large amounts of power while switching. Thus efficiency can put a premium on switching quickly, but this can cause transients that can excite stray inductances and generate significant voltages that can couple to the gate and cause unintentional switching. FET circuits can therefore require very careful layout and can involve trades between <b>switching</b> <b>speed</b> and power dissipation. There is also a trade-off between voltage rating and 'on' resistance, so high voltage FETs have a relatively high 'on' resistance and hence conduction losses.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 Vactec {{introduced}} a compact RO branded as Vactrol. Unlike the tube-coupled ROs of Fender and Gibson, Vactrols were sealed and sturdy devices. In the early 1970s, Vactec replaced incandescent bulbs by LEDs. This increased the <b>switching</b> <b>speed,</b> {{but not to}} the level required for digital devices. Therefore, the introduction of the faster photodiodes and phototransistors in the 1970s pushed out ROs from the market. ROs retained narrow application niches in sound equipment and some industrial automation devices that did not require high speeds. Vactec did not extend their rights to the trademark Vactrol, and it has become a household word in the English language for any RO used in audio equipment, including the ROs of Fender and Gibson. As of 2012, the Vactrol ROs were produced by PerkinElmer, the successor Vactec.|$|E
2500|$|Although this {{technique}} is rather simple, it represents an enormous fabrication problem. A new kind of cell pattern potentially introduces as much as twice the amount of fabrication cost and infrastructure; the number of possible quantum dot locations on an [...] grid is doubled and an overall increase in geometric design complexity is inevitable. Yet another problem {{this technique}} presents is that the additional space between cells of the same orientation decreases the energy barriers between a cell's ground state and a cell’s first excited state.

2500|$|Many new {{developments}} are targeted at reducing parasitic inductance (ESL). This increases the resonance {{frequency of the}} capacitor and, for example, can follow the constantly increasing <b>switching</b> <b>speed</b> of digital circuits. Miniaturization, especially in the SMD multilayer ceramic chip capacitors (MLCC), increases the resonance frequency. Parasitic inductance is further lowered by placing the electrodes on the longitudinal side of the chip instead of the lateral side. The [...] "face-down" [...] construction associated with multi-anode technology in tantalum electrolytic capacitors further reduced ESL. Capacitor families such as the so-called MOS capacitor or silicon capacitors offer solutions when capacitors at frequencies up to the GHz range are needed.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{collector}} current {{rises above the}} data sheet limit [...] a new breakdown mechanism become important: the second breakdown. This phenomenon is caused by excessive heating of some points (hot spots) in the base-emitter region of the bipolar junction transistor, which give rise to an exponentially increasing current through these points: this exponential rise of current in turn gives rise to even more overheating, originating a positive thermal feedback mechanism. While analyzing the [...] static characteristic, {{the presence of this}} phenomenon is seen as a sharp collector voltage drop and a corresponding almost vertical rise of {{the collector}} current. At the present, {{it is not possible to}} produce a transistor without hot spots and thus without second breakdown, since their presence is related to the technology of refinement of silicon. During this process, very small but finite quantities of metals remain in localized portions of the wafer: these particles of metals became deep centers of recombination, i.e. centers where current exists in a preferred way. While this phenomenon is destructive for Bipolar junction transistors working in the usual way, it can be used to push-up further the current and voltage limits of a device working in avalanche mode by limiting its time duration: also, the <b>switching</b> <b>speed</b> of the device is not negatively affected. A clear description of avalanche transistor circuits working in second breakdown regime together with some examples can be found in the paper [...]|$|E
