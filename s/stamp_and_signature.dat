40|$|The questimed {{document}} examination {{plays an}} important role in forensic science. In Chinese documents, such as business contracts, there are <b>stamps</b> <b>and</b> <b>signatures</b> (or fingerprints) over them. Sometimes, those patterns (stamps, signatures or fingerprints) may superimpose on each other. When the documents being served as evidences to court, the overlapped patterns become contentious usually. Even in the document examination, overlapped patterns may interfere with the examination work. It will be helpful if we can reduce the overlapping influence before processing the document examination. The objective of image segmentation is to find regions that represent objects or meaningful parts of objects. The method for image segmentation is to find the measure of homogeneous regions of objects or to detect the boundaries between objects. In this paper, we review some color image models and explain how we apply the image segmentation method to analyze overlapped patterns in the document examination. Synthetic images and one real case image are used to show the capability of the image segmentation method...|$|R

Based on a 1966 fake letter that appeared in Dossiers Secrets allegedly written by the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers, being an adaptation of material contained in a 1964 book by René Descadeillas involving François-Pierre d'Hautpoul, these revised claims appeared in a 1977 Priory document by Jean Delaude, Le Cercle d'Ulysse. This revised version of the story stayed more-or-less intact right up to 1990, containing minor variations involving exact dates. The 1977 Priory document claimed Saunière discovered three documents: 1) a genealogy of the Counts of Rhedae dated 1243 bearing the seal of Blanche of Castile, 2) a document of 1608 relating to François-Pierre d'Hautpoul providing a complementary genealogy from 1240 onwards and, 3) a last will and testament of Henri d'Hautpoul dated 24 April 1695 bearing the <b>stamp</b> <b>and</b> <b>signature</b> of the testator, adding they were originally sold by Saunière's niece Madame James to two Englishmen, Captain Ronald Stansmore and Sir Thomas Frazer of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers.
