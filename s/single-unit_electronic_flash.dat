50|$|The Nikon {{brand name}} for its <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> units, Speedlight, is {{frequently}} {{used as a}} generic term for <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> equipment.|$|R
50|$|Simple <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> {{units are}} often mounted {{on or near}} the camera; many {{inexpensive}} cameras have an <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> unit built in.|$|R
50|$|A custom <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> unit, the AF130P, {{was part}} of the {{original}} Auto 110 system, and was produced until the camera ceased being manufactured. Pentax responded to criticism that this <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> unit was too large by introducing the smaller AF100P <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> unit in 1980. This unit, however, was never part of the Pentax camera kits and became rare.|$|R
5000|$|Flash {{exposures}} vs. continuous-light exposuresImportantly, Eastman Kodak Company’s exposure {{recommendations for}} <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> are slightly different than for continuous-light exposures.

5000|$|Because leaf {{shutters}} synchronized <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> at all shutter speeds {{especially at}} fast shutter speeds of [...] {{of a second}} or faster, cameras using leaf shutters were more desirable to studio photographers who used sophisticated studio <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> systems.|$|R

First half covers fundamentals of photography and <b>electronic</b> <b>flashes,</b> including experiments on application of <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> to photography, stroboscopy, motion analysis, and high-speed videography. Students write five extensive lab reports, which may be suitable for the Phase II Writing Requirement. In the second half, students work in small groups to select, design, and execute independent projects in measurement or photography that apply learned techniques...|$|R

5000|$|... 1987: Pentax SFX (Japan; called SF1 in USA): first {{interchangeable}} lens SLR with built-in <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> (first built-in flash with TTL autoexposure in any camera). Built-in <b>electronic</b> <b>flashes</b> for convenient auxiliary light in dim situations or for fill-light in high contrast situations {{first appeared on}} the non-SLR Voigtländer Vitrona (West Germany) of 1964 and had been common on point-and-shoot cameras since the mid-1970s. Built-in TTL autoflashes became standard on {{all but the most}} expensive 35 mm SLRs cameras by the early 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{features}} {{found on}} many SLR cameras include through-the-lens (TTL) metering and sophisticated flash control {{referred to as}} [...] "dedicated electronic flash". In a dedicated system, once the dedicated <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> is inserted into the camera's hot shoe and turned on, there is then communication between camera and flash. The camera's synchronization speed is set, along with the aperture. Many camera models measure the light that reflects off of the film plane, which controls the flash duration of the <b>electronic</b> <b>flash.</b> This is denoted TTL flash metering.|$|R
50|$|Because they {{expose the}} film in a single exposure, fixed lens cameras {{can be used with}} <b>electronic</b> <b>flash,</b> which would not work {{consistently}} with rotational panoramic cameras.|$|R

5000|$|X-sync is the {{simplest}} {{to explain and}} implement: the flash is fired at the instant the shutter is fully open. <b>Electronic</b> <b>flash</b> equipment produces a very short flash ...|$|R

5000|$|X (xenon) sync is a mode {{designed}} for use with <b>electronic</b> <b>flash.</b> [...] In this mode, {{the timing of the}} contacts coincides exactly with the full opening of the shutter, since xenon flashes respond almost instantly.|$|R
50|$|A typical <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> {{unit has}} <b>electronic</b> {{circuitry}} to charge a high-capacity capacitor {{to several hundred}} volts. When the flash is triggered by the shutter's flash synchronization contact, the capacitor is discharged almost instantaneously through a flash tube, producing a flash of very brief duration almost instantaneously (i.e., the flash duration, often around 1/1000 of a second, is shorter than most practical shutter speeds, and full brightness is reached before the shutter has time to close appreciably). Synchronization of full flash brightness with maximum shutter opening was problematic with bulbs which took an appreciable time to ignite and reach full brightness; <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> does not have these difficulties.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>flash</b> was {{developed}} in the late 1950s while flashbulbs were still in general use. Early units were expensive and often large and heavy as the power unit was a separate unit to the flash gun head and was powered by a large lead-acid battery, and usually carried by the photographer by means of a shoulder strap. Towards the end of the 1960s, the size had dropped {{to the point where they}} were matching the size of conventional bulb flash guns (though the price, having dropped, was still an obstacle). The <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> system eventually superseded bulb guns as prices came down, rendering flashbulbs virtually obsolete.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{development}} of fundus photography, David Alvis, and Harold Novotny, performed the first fluorescein angiography (FFA) in 1959, using the Zeiss fundus camera with <b>electronic</b> <b>flash.</b> This development was huge feat {{in the world of}} Ophthalmology.|$|R
5000|$|M4-2 - 1977-80 (17,000 {{sets were}} {{manufactured}}). First M manufactured since 1975, with stronger gears {{to support a}} motor drive. It was the first M with a hot shoe for <b>electronic</b> <b>flash.</b> No self-timer. Made in Canada.|$|R
5000|$|Like the View-Master Personal, {{it lacked}} a hot shoe but did feature a cold shoe, {{as well as}} both [...] "X" [...] and [...] "M" [...] contacts, so it should work with most modern <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> units with the proper cord.|$|R
5000|$|... 1979: Sedic Hanimex Reflex Flash 35 (Australia/Japan): first SLR with {{built-in}} <b>electronic</b> <b>flash.</b> Otherwise a wholly forgettable camera; a cheaply made 35 mm SLR of low specifications and poor quality, with a fixed Hanimar 41mm f/2.8 lens and mirror gate shutter.|$|R
40|$|Recovery {{time after}} {{dazzling}} the macula by conventional <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> {{used by the}} photographer instead of the light of an ophthalmoscope was recorded in 100 normal subjects and 50 cases of active central serous retinopathy. In normal subjects the recovery time after macular dazzling test was 10 to 54 seconds. There {{was no difference in}} value between the two sexes. The recovery value increases with the advancement of age. The recovery time was 10 to 15 minutes in cases of active central serous retinopathy and there was no delay in recovery time in healed central serous retinopathy. The values elicited by <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> were repeatable in comparison to the technique of dazzling the macula by light of an ophthalmoscope...|$|R
