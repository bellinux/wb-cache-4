50|$|The most {{prevalent}} current method of recording analogue sound {{on a film}} print is by stereo variable-area (SVA) recording, a technique first used in the mid-1970s as Dolby Stereo. A two-channel audio signal is recorded {{as a pair of}} lines running parallel with the film's direction of travel through the projector. The lines change area (grow broader or narrower) depending on the magnitude of the <b>signal.</b> The <b>projector</b> shines light from a small lamp, called an exciter, through a perpendicular slit onto the film. The image on the small slice of exposed track modulates the intensity of the light, which is collected by a photosensitive element: a photocell, a photodiode or CCD.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the output}} frame {{rate of the}} PC {{graphics}} card is relatively constant and cannot be fine tuned on the fly, we use the PC video output rate as the master signal for system synchronization. The projector's FPGA also creates signals encoding the current frame rate. These control signals interface directly to an Animatics SM3420D ”Smart Motor” which contains firmware and motion control parameters resulting in a stable, velocity-based control loop that ensures the motor velocity stays {{in sync with the}} <b>signals</b> from the <b>projector.</b>|$|R
25|$|An LCD {{projector}} {{is a type}} {{of video}} projector for displaying video, images or computer data on a screen or other flat surface. It is a modern equivalent of the slide projector or overhead projector. To display images, LCD (liquid-crystal display) projectors typically send light from a metal-halide lamp through a prism or series of dichroic filters that separates light to three polysilicon panels – one each for the red, green and blue components of the video <b>signal.</b> The LCD <b>projector</b> was invented in 1984 by Gene Dolgoff.|$|R
5000|$|In {{bistatic}} sonar, {{the travel}} distance from projector to target and from target to receiver is R = Rpt [...] + Rtr [...] As the projector {{is separated from}} receiver by Rpr [...] distance, first Rpr /C seconds after the ping starts, the receiver is just waiting. After that time, it receives direct <b>signal</b> from the <b>projector</b> (often referred to as “direct blast”,) which lasts τ seconds. So the sonar cannot detect targets within the ellipse R = Rpr + Cτ, as shown at the picture. High level reverberation in the projector area {{does not affect the}} dead zone.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} make the {{operator}} freely walk in virtual environment (VE), a new prototype of VE system for assembly is presented in this paper. In this system, a special machine is designed and it enables the operator to walk inside the VE in any directions over a long distance without actually leaving the physical device. Images produced by the computer are projected upon the surface of a large spherical cap screen surrounding the operator by means of a group of high power <b>projectors.</b> <b>Signals</b> provided by the position sensors attached to the operator are used by the computer to update the projected images, which provides the operator the illusion of walking freely through the virtual scenes. This VE system can acquire wide field of view and form panorama surrounding the operator, which may enhance the realistic sense of simulation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOcean {{measurements}} of the scintillation index (SI) of surface forward-scattered signals made in August 2002 are presented and compared with a model developed by Yang and McDaniel [Waves in Random Media 1, 419 – 439 (1991) ]. The acoustic measurements employed continuous wave (CW) pulses and linear frequency modulated (LFM) sweeps with center frequencies of 20 and 40 kHz. Simultaneously, {{measurements of}} wind speed, directional surface wave height spectrum,and ocean sound speed profile were made. The sea state was between 0 and 1 during the four days of the experiment, {{in part because the}} location is very much in the lee of San Clemente Island. The measured values of SI are found to agree with Yang and McDaniel model predictions, except for measurements with the largest signal bandwidth and/or the narrowest beamwidths, which violate model assumptions of continuous <b>signals</b> and omnidirectional <b>projectors</b> and hydrophones. Inaddition, the data show that SI decreases with increasing signal bandwidth (or decreasing temporalextent). An extension to the Yang and McDaniel model is developed that accounts for a reduction in signal temporal extent or ocean surface ensonification. The extended model is in qualitative agreement with the measurements, in that SI is predicted to decrease with increasing signal bandwidth...|$|R
