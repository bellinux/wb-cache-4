5|$|Leslie is {{convinced}} she can reason with Andy {{if they can}} talk without their lawyers, but Andy will not return her calls. Finally, Ann calls Andy and asks {{him to come to}} her house. Later that day, he arrives completely naked, having assumed Ann wanted to take him back. A disgusted Ann leaves the house, leaving Leslie and Andy to talk. Andy admits he is suing the town in an attempt to win Ann back, and <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> a different way he can impress her. The next day at city hall, Andy tells Leslie and Scott he will drop the lawsuit if they agree to fill in the pit right away. Scott agrees, unaware it was a trick between Andy and Leslie. The next day the pit is filled in and turned into a lot, and an impressed Ann waves at Andy while the construction work is going on. The episode ends with Keef riding a motorboat, revealing his role in KaBOOM! was an elaborate prank to get the playground built, and announcing he is going to build a hospital in a poor part of China.|$|E

500|$|As {{with the}} pilot, [...] "The Thing You Love Most" [...] was co-written by series co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Smallville co-executive {{producer}} Greg Beeman served as director. The episode {{focuses on the}} rivalry between Emma and Regina, as each believes they know {{what is best for}} Henry. In an interview with TV Overmind, actress Lana Parrilla explained that viewers would see a [...] "vulnerable" [...] side of Regina/The Evil Queen in this episode. Says Parrilla, [...] "What I’ve been trying to show is not the hatred for Snow White, but where it derives from. It’s not so surfaced. That brings a vulnerability to the character. You’ll see into her history and that exposes her in a very vulnerable way as well." [...] As for Regina's troubled relationship with Henry, Parrilla noted that [...] "she may have a cold heart, but I think she really, genuinely loves her son. She doesn’t think of him as an adopted son, <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> him as her son." ...|$|E

James Chamberlin of IGN did {{not think}} that the black and white {{documentary}} really worked for him, and when it was over he didn't feel like he had just watched an episode of House. Chamberlin graded the episode with a 7.7. Michelle Romero, of Entertainment Weekly commented [...] "I loved it when House told his crew that she Dr. Terzi got the gig because she had more experience than the swimsuit model". Television without Pity graded the episode with a B- (out of 84 votes). According to Glen L. Diaz, of BuddyTV, various fans think that the smile on Cuddy's face {{at the end of the}} episode explains everything about how <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> House. Peter Jacobson submitted the episode for a Primetime Emmy Award on his behalf in the category Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. Sean Whitesell submitted the episode on his behalf in the category Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Neither nomination came through.|$|E
500|$|Christine Love {{describes}} herself as [...] "a writer first, and a game designer second", as writing was her initial goal. She originally pictured her future {{as that of a}} novelist, with a day job as a programmer to support herself. Love describes her games as being about [...] "our relationship with technology, about human relationships in general, and about seeing things from different perspectives," [...] as well as having [...] "a ton of words". She strives for her stories to be true and sincere, but not necessarily realistic. Love is also interested in the portrayal of gender and sexuality in video games; in Digital and Analogue, she was careful to avoid mentioning or assuming the gender of the player or the character they control, though the love interests in the games are female. Privately, however, <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> them as female, as her intention was to create games that could be easily appreciated by queer people such as herself, without having to project themselves onto a relationship that did not match up to their perceptions. Love believes that indie games have [...] "more meaningful depictions of queer experiences" [...] than those from larger studios.|$|E

500|$|... "When I Look at You" [...] {{was written}} by Hillary Lindsey and John Shanks. It was used to promote the 2010 coming-of-age romantic drama film The Last Song based on Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name, in which Cyrus stars as Veronica [...] "Ronnie" [...] Miller, an angry, rebellious seventeen-year-old forced to spend a summer with her estranged father, Steve (Greg Kinnear). The song was first {{included}} on Cyrus's 2009 extended play The Time of Our Lives {{and then on the}} film and its corresponding soundtrack. The song was initially to be included on Cyrus's 2010 album Can't Be Tamed; however, it was decided to include it on The Time of Our Lives as well as The Last Song because it fit the film's concept well. According to Cyrus, when she sings [...] "When I Look at You", <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> family and love. [...] "It's kind of what this movie is all about", she said. A remix version titled [...] "Te Miro a Ti", featuring Spanish singer David Bisbal was released later; in it, Cyrus sings her lines in English, while Bisbal's are mingled in both English and Spanish.|$|E
500|$|In Eric Shanower's graphic novel Age of Bronze, {{currently}} {{still being}} serialised, Troilus is youthful {{but not the}} youngest son of Priam and Hecuba. In the first two collected volumes of {{this version of the}} Trojan War, Shanower provides a total of six pages of sources covering the story elements of his work alone. These include most of the fictional works discussed above from Guido and Boccaccio down to Morley and Walton. Shanower begins Troilus' love story with the youth making fun of Polyxena's love for Hector and in the process accidentally knocking aside Cressida's veil. He follows the latter into the temple of Athena to gawp at her. Pandarus is the widow Cressida's uncle encouraging him. Cressida rejects Troilus' initial advances not because of wanting to act in a seemly manner, as in Chaucer or Shakespeare, but because <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> him as just a boy. However, her uncle persuades her to encourage his affection, in the hope that being close to a son of Priam will protect against the hostility of the Trojans to the family of the traitor Calchas. Troilus' unrequited love is used as comic relief in an otherwise serious retelling of the Trojan War cycle. The character is portrayed as often indecisive and ineffectual as on the second page of this episode sample at the official site [...] It {{remains to be seen how}} Shanower will further develop the story.|$|E
500|$|Cyrus {{recorded}} a cover version of [...] "Kicking and Screaming", written by John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi, and originally recorded by Ashlee Simpson for her 2005 album I Am Me.Bonus Tracks]|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=October 10, 2010}} [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] {{was written by}} Dr. Luke, Claude Kelly, and Jessica Cornish. The song was not originally meant for Cyrus to perform, but, once it reached Cyrus, the writing team reworked the lyrics, intending to write an accompanying theme for the clothing line. In order to please audiences, Dr. Luke, Kelly, and Cornish fixated on composing a fun, upbeat song that narrated reflections of Cyrus' personality. To write his contributions to the song, Kelly said he tried to mimic Cyrus' songwriting: [...] "It’s the same song from {{a different point of}} view, you just have to find that unique perspective." [...] Cyrus was pleased with the song and selected it partially due to the need for tracks to appear on The Time of Our Lives. [...] "When I Look at You", written by Shanks and Hillary Lindsey, was initially to be included on Cyrus' succeeding album; it was eventually chosen to promote the 2010 film The Last Song after Cyrus recognized that it fit the film's concept well. According to Cyrus, when she sings [...] "When I Look at You", <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> family and love. [...] "It's kind of what this movie is all about", she said. The title track, [...] "The Time of Our Lives", was composed by Dr. Luke, Kelly, Kesha Sebert (known as Ke$ha), and Pebe Sebert. Kesha co-wrote her contributions to [...] "The Time of Our Lives" [...] with the ideal of constructing a party anthem for young audiences, based on her first impression of Cyrus' personality; comedic and likable.|$|E

2500|$|As Clarissa {{prepares for}} the party <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> the famous actor Sally is lunching with, a B-movie action star who {{recently}} came out as gay. This sparks ruminations on why she, Clarissa, was not invited to lunch and again towards thoughts of the worth of her life. In her mind, she is [...] "only a wife" [...] (p94). Clarissa tries {{to be grateful for}} the moment she is inhabiting, cutting the stems off roses at the kitchen sink. <b>She</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> the holiday she had when she was eighteen with Louis and Richard, a time when [...] "it seemed anything could happen, anything at all" [...] (p95). <b>She</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> kissing Richard, a dramatic reversal of the kiss Woolf's Clarissa Dalloway shares with a girl when she was young. Clarissa (Vaughan) realizes without that holiday and the house where she, Richard and Louis spent it, so many events would not have occurred, including this moment now, standing in a kitchen cutting flowers for her best friend, Richard's, party. She remembers telling herself at the time she was not betraying Louis by sleeping with Richard, it was the free-wheeling 1960's, Louis was aware of what was going on. She wonders what might have happened if she had tried to remain with Richard. She imagines that other future, [...] "full of infidelities and great battles; as a vast and enduring romance laid over friendship so searing and profound it would accompany them to the grave...She could have had a life as potent and dangerous as literature itself." [...] "Or then again maybe not," [...] Clarissa thinks. She realizes that maybe there is nothing equal to the recollection of having been young. She catalogues the moment she and Richard kissed for the first time, by a pond's edge at dusk. [...] "It had seemed like the beginning of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, more than thirty years, to realize that it 'was' happiness...Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other." ...|$|E
