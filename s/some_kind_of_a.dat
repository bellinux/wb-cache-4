Both king Solomon and the reader are confronted with <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{juridical}}-detective riddle. Meir Sternberg notes that two genres merge in the story: A riddle and a test; The juridical dilemma, which is the riddle, also constitutes a test for the young king: If he will solve it he will be acknowledged to possess divine wisdom. Stuart Lasine classifies the story as a law-court riddle.|$|E
25|$|Though Finnish bands tend {{to write}} their lyrics in English as to leave their music open to {{countries}} outside of native Finnish boundaries, in the 1990s bands such as Apulanta, Miljoonasade, Ultra Bra and the shamanic art-punk group CMX had found their share of success with Finnish lyrics. The hard-to-define electronic country garage rock group 22 Pistepirkko got excellent reviews in the Finnish rock press and has reached <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cult status in Central Europe. Some other notable Finnish cult rock groups of this era are the psychedelic, Hendrixian Kingston Wall that went in their late period far into psychedelia taking influence from shamanism and some of some genres of electronic dance music, and equally psychedelic but gothic, gloomy, and heavy Mana Mana.|$|E

500|$|Harrison had {{intended}} to co-produce his long-awaited follow-up to All Things Must Pass with Phil Spector, a mainstay of his career since 1970. Spector's unreliability meant that Harrison was forced to produce Living in the Material World alone – an outcome that music critics Greg Kot and Zeth Lundy find regrettable, in light of how Spector's signature Wall of Sound treatment might have suited ballads such as [...] "Who Can See It" [...] and [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round". Another regular Harrison collaborator, John Barham, provided orchestral arrangements as before, and noted an [...] "austere quality" [...] {{in some of the}} new songs. [...] "George was under stress during Living in the Material World," [...] Barham said later. [...] "I felt that he was going through <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crisis. I think it may have been spiritual, but I cannot be sure." ...|$|E
500|$|They and {{the episode}} writers {{developed}} a storyline {{in which a}} victim's childhood experimentation, when they were injected with something, was now [...] "coming back to haunt them." [...] Whitman noted that the concept, like others in the show, was based on real scientific knowledge, [...] "The notion is, <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> medical treatment that they were given allowed their brain to command vibrations that would take place. It really is true that essentially what heat is is vibrations of atoms, so if your brain can cause some kind of vibration to take place, eventually you could create enough heat to even create a flame." [...] Pinkner added, [...] "And if you haven't yet mastered pyrokinesis {{and the ability to}} excite molecules that are outside your body, well then you're going to excite the ones inside your body and you're going to blow up, sadly." ...|$|E
500|$|Bono and guitarist The Edge {{had been}} reading works by {{cyberpunk}} author William Gibson, who wrote about a futuristic urban environment known as [...] "The Sprawl". [...] Gibson was an influence in {{the texture of the}} song, which Bono described as [...] "fucked up sci-fi". [...] Bono wanted to use noise to create a visual setting for the song, similar to Gibson's futuristic world, filled with advertisements on LED displays and neon signs, as in the 1982 film Blade Runner. [...] With [...] "Zooropa" [...] as the album's opening song, Bono stated that he wanted the album's music to be like [...] "legal drugs" [...] that would create a trip where [...] "you come out of the other end and you feel like you've been on <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> journey". The closing song on the album, [...] "The Wanderer", features Johnny Cash on vocals, and was intended on being the [...] "antidote" [...] to the futuristic-sounding opener.|$|E

500|$|Cowboy Frank Patterson [...] "made <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> compromise" [...] with Captain Hurst, who {{persuaded the}} posse to withdraw, with the {{understanding}} that the mules would be returned. The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Capt. Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft, and specifically charged Frank McLaury with assisting with hiding the mules. He also reproduced the flyer in The Tombstone Epitaph, on July 30, 1880. Frank McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly Nuggett, calling Hurst [...] "unmanly", [...] "a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar", and accused Hurst of stealing the mules himself. Capt. Hurst later cautioned Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan that the Cowboys had threatened their lives. Virgil reported that Frank accosted him and warned him, [...] "If you ever again follow us as close as you did, then you will have to fight anyway." [...] A month later, Earp ran into Frank and Tom McLaury in Charleston, and they told him if he ever followed them as he had done before, they would kill him.|$|E
500|$|The band {{contributed to}} Bosnian relief efforts to enhance {{humanitarian}} and {{public awareness of}} the issue, and Bono and Carter subsequently collaborated on the documentary Miss Sarajevo, which showcased the war-torn city during Carter's six months living there. In 1995, U2 and Eno wrote the song [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] as a response to [...] "the surreal acts of defiance that had taken place during the siege of Sarajevo". One such act was a beauty pageant organized by Bosnian women who planned to fight the war with their [...] "lipstick and heels". During the pageant, all of the participants walked onto the stage carrying a banner that said, [...] "Don't let them kill us". [...] The winner of the pageant, 17-year-old Inela Nogić, later said the pageant [...] "was a crazy thing to do during a war. But we tried to live a normal life. It was <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> defence mechanism we all had." [...] Years later, Bono said, [...] "It was pure Dada and it deserved to be celebrated in song." [...] Of the song's meaning, he said, [...] "Everywhere people had heard their call for help—but help never came. That was the feeling. I had tried to tackle subjects like this head-on, but I'd learnt a lesson. You have to try and make the same points, in a different, less direct, more surrealist way." [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] was recorded with Luciano Pavarotti and released as the first single from U2's side-project with Eno entitled Original Soundtracks 1; the record was released under the pseudonym [...] "Passengers".|$|E

2500|$|The {{folklore}} of some {{native peoples}} of Siberia, who would routinely find mammoth bones, and sometimes frozen mammoth bodies, in eroding river banks, had various interesting explanations for these finds. Among the Khanty {{people of the}} Irtysh River basin, a belief existed that the mammoth was <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> water spirit. According to other Khanty, the mammoth was a creature that lived underground, [...] burrowing its tunnels as it went, and would die if it accidentally came to the surface.|$|E

2500|$|After the Bloody Sunday of January 9, 1905, Merezhkovsky's views changed drastically, {{the defeat}} of the Imperial Russian Navy by the Imperial Japanese Navy helping him see, as he put it, [...] "the anti-Christian nature of the Russian monarchy." [...] The 1905 Revolution was now seen by Merezhkovsky as a prelude for <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{religious}} upheaval he thought himself to be a prophet of. The writer became an ardent supporter of the civil unrest, writing pro-revolutionary verse, organizing protest parties for students, like that in Alexandrinsky theatre. In October 1905 he greeted the government's 'freedoms-granting' decree but since then was only strengthening ties with leftist radicals, notably, esers.|$|E

But producer Maksim Dunayevsky decided to make it a pop record and since I've never been keen on pop music, the project flopped," [...] she later explained. The recorded material was taken back to Russia but remained unreleased. [...] "I was well aware that the material we recorded was primitive and had nothing whatsoever to do with what I'd been dreaming of. I felt like I'd been given one chance and squandered it," [...] she later admitted. She spent in America six months and spoke warmly of her vocal coach Seth Riggs. [...] "When I first came to him, he was jovially dismissive of the Russian vocal school. Having heard me he was impressed and said I had brilliant technique, for which I have to thank Natalya Andrianova," [...] the singer recalled.|$|E
2500|$|Puciato later {{commented on}} the act saying; “It was {{early in the day}} and as most people, you kind of get that out of the way early in the day but I never did.

There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never going to happen again, when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway. And then just kind of making a statement in a way that I felt would be unavoidable for people to pay attention to.” ...|$|E
